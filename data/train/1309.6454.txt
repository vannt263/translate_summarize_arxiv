    "this article is motivated by the following result of berestycki , et al . given in @xcite for the laplacian perturbed by a divergence - free drift in dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a bounded @xmath12 regular open set and let @xmath13 be a bounded @xmath7-dimensional vector field such that @xmath14 on @xmath2 in the sense of distributions ( distr . ) , i.e. @xmath15 for @xmath5 , let ( @xmath16 ) be the principal eigen - pair corresponding to the dirichlet problem for the operator @xmath17 .",
    "theorem 0.3 of @xcite asserts that @xmath18 remains bounded as @xmath9 , if and only if the equation @xmath19 has a solution @xmath20 ( called a first integral of @xmath6 ) , such that @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ".    the result can be interpreted intuitively in the following way : functions @xmath20 satisfying are constant along the flow of the vector field @xmath23 ( see section  [ sec : ub ] ) , and the existence of ( non - trivial ) first integrals allows for flow lines that are contained in @xmath2 . on the other hand , if no such @xmath20 exist , then the flow leaves @xmath2 with speed proportional to @xmath24 . adding the laplacian @xmath25 to @xmath26 , or equivalently the brownian motion to the flow , results in a stochastic process whose trajectories gradually depart from the integral curves of @xmath6 , but the general picture is similar :",
    "if nontrivial first integrals exist , then the trajectories may remain in @xmath2 with positive probability during a finite time interval , even as @xmath9 . in this case",
    "we are lead to a nontrivial limiting transition mechanism between the flow lines .",
    "the result described in the foregoing enjoys many extensions and has proved quite useful in various applications describing the influence of a fluid flow on a diffusion , see for example @xcite . in the context of a compact , connected riemannian manifold a sufficient and necessary condition for @xmath18 to remain bounded , as @xmath9 , expressed in terms of the eigenspaces of the advection operator @xmath27 , has been given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to verify that a similar property of the principal eigenvalue holds when the classical laplacian is replaced by the fractional laplacian @xmath4 with @xmath28 .",
    "we consider @xmath29 defined as the set of all the nonzero first integrals in the sobolev space @xmath30 equipped with the norm coming from the dirichlet form @xmath31 of @xmath4 ( see below ) .",
    "the sobolev norm condition on the first integrals reflects smoothing properties of the green function of the fractional laplacian , while is related to the flow defined by @xmath6 .",
    "the main difficulty in our development stems from roughness of general elements of @xmath32 and non - locality of @xmath4 , which prevent us from a direct application of the differential calculus in the way it has been done in @xcite .",
    "instead , we use conditioning suggested by a paper of bogdan and dyda @xcite , approximation techniques for flows given by diperna and lions in @xcite , and the properties of the green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of @xmath4 obtained by bogdan , jakubowski in @xcite and chen , et al . in @xcite for @xmath3 and bounded @xmath1-regular open sets @xmath2 . these properties allow to define and study , via the classical krein - rutman theorem and compactness arguments , the principal eigen - pair @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath3 .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows .",
    "[ main - thm ] suppose that @xmath35 is a bounded domain with @xmath1-regular boundary that is simply connected , i.e. @xmath36 - the complement of @xmath37 - is connected .",
    "if @xmath28 , and @xmath38 is of zero divergence , then @xmath39 and the infimum is attained .",
    "here we use the convention that @xmath40 , hence @xmath41 if and only if the zero function is the only first integral .",
    "equality results from the following lower and upper bounds of @xmath18 , @xmath42 @xmath43 the bounds are proved in sections  [ sec : lb ] and [ sec : ub ] , correspondingly . in section [ proof - coro ]",
    "we explain that the minimum on the right hand side of is attained , and we finish the proof of the theorem .    comparing our approach with the arguments used in the case of local operators , cf .",
    "@xcite , we note that the use of the green function seems more robust whenever we lack sufficient differentiability of functions appearing in variational formulas . recall that in the present case we need to deal with @xmath30 , which limits the applicability of the arguments based on the usual differentiation rules of the classical calculus , e.g. the leibnitz formula or the chain rule .",
    "we consider the use of the green function as one of the major features of our approach .",
    "in addition , the non - locality of the quadratic forms forces a substantial modifications of several other arguments , e.g. those involving conditioning of nonlocal operators and quadratic forms in the proof of the upper bound in section [ sec : ub ] .",
    "finally , we stress the fact that the dirichlet fractional laplacian on a bounded domain @xmath2 _ is not _ a fractional power of the dirichlet laplacian on @xmath2 , e.g. the eigenfunctions of these operators have a different power - type decay at the boundary , see @xcite in this connection .    as a preparation for the proof , we recall in section [ sec : p ] the estimates of @xcite for the green function and transition density of @xmath44 for the dirichlet problem on @xmath2 .",
    "these functions are defined using hunt s formula , which in principle requires the drift @xmath45 to be defined on the entire @xmath46 .",
    "we show however , in corollary [ cor010212 ] , that they are determined by the restriction of the drift to the domain @xmath2 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we prove that the corresponding green s and transition operators are compact , see lemmas [ lem : gdc1 ] and [ lem : gdc1 kb ] .",
    "this result is used to define the principal eigen - pair of @xmath44 , via the krein - rutman theorem . in theorem [ thm011307 ] of section [ sec4 ]",
    "we prove that the domains of @xmath4 and @xmath44 in @xmath47 coincide . in section",
    "[ sec : pt11 ] we employ the bilinear form of @xmath44 to estimate the principal eigenvalue .",
    "the technical assumption @xmath48 is only needed in sections  [ sec : ub ] to characterize the first integrals of @xmath6 by means of the theory of flows developed by diperna and lions in @xcite for sobolev - regular vector fields .",
    "we start with a brief description of the setting and recapitulation of some of the results of @xcite .",
    "further details and references may be found in those papers ( see also @xcite and the references therein ) . in what follows , @xmath49 is the euclidean space of dimension @xmath50 , scalar product @xmath51 , norm @xmath52 and lebesgue measure @xmath53 .",
    "all sets , measures and functions in @xmath49 considered throughout this paper will be borel .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the ball of center @xmath55 and radius @xmath56 .",
    "we will consider nonempty , bounded open set @xmath35 , whose boundary is of class @xmath1 .",
    "the latter means that @xmath56 exists such that for every @xmath57 there are balls @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which are tangent at @xmath60 ( the _ inner _ and _ outer _ tangent ball , respectively ) .",

    "* lemma  1 ) .",
    "we note that each connected component of @xmath2 contains a ball of radius @xmath61 , and the same is true for @xmath62 .",
    "therefore @xmath2 and @xmath62 have a finite number of components , which will play a role in a later discussion of extensions of the vector field to a neighborhood of @xmath63 .",
    "the distance of a given @xmath55 to @xmath62 will be denoted by @xmath64    _ constants _ mean positive numbers , that do not depend on the considered arguments of the functions being compared .",
