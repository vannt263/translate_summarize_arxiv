    "the observational prospects for low frequency studies of star - forming galaxies are improving .",
    "there is increasing interest in low frequency radio instruments , due to their value in observing high redshift 21 cm lines , among other reasons . the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt )",
    "is specifically designed to provide interferometric data for radio sources in the 50 mhz to 1.5 ghz range with high sensitivity .",
    "the 74 and 333 mhz systems on the very large array ( vla ) provide high angular resolution images @xcite , and have completed a survey of the northern sky @xcite .",
    "they are currently being upgraded for use on the karl g. jansky vla . the low frequency array ( lofar ) , now coming online , is a new radio telescope with long baseline interferometry capabilities , and can go all the way down to 15 mhz .",
    "the leiden lofar sky surveys project will image some nearby star - forming galaxies in radio , possibly including starbursts like m82 .",
    "lofar will be joined by the 21 cm pathfinder experiments at frequencies above 100 mhz and possibly the long wavelength array at frequencies of 10 to 88 mhz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ultimately , the square kilometre array ( ska ) should be able to observe galaxies down to 70 mhz with high sensitivity .",
    "the radio spectrum of star - forming galaxies is dominated by synchrotron emission from cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and positrons ( @xmath1 ) in diffuse magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there is also free - free emission , which typically comes from h ii regions in a galaxy .",
    "both of these emission processes are associated with star - formation : cosmic rays are generated somehow by star formation ( possibly through shock acceleration in supernova remnants ) , and h ii regions surround young , massive stars that produce ionizing radiation . since synchrotron emission has a steeply falling spectrum ( typically @xmath2 ) whereas free - free emission does not ( @xmath3 ) , the synchrotron emission dominates below about 30 ghz ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while these processes are both present in nearly all star - forming galaxies , the physical conditions within star - forming galaxies can vary tremendously .",
    "extreme environments for star - formation can be found in starbursts ( defined here as regions with star - formation rate surface densities @xmath4 ) .",
    "examples of starburst regions include the galactic centre cmz and those found in the galaxies ngc 253 , m82 , and arp 220 .",
    "average densities and pressures in these regions can be hundreds of times greater than in the present - day milky way , altering the structure of the ism .",
    "a wealth of information on how these environments affect the crs and ionized gas is available at mhz frequencies .",
    "in particular , different cooling processes may set the cr @xmath1 lifetime at different energies . at low frequencies , bremsstrahlung , with an energy - independent loss time , and ionization , which is most effective at low energies ,",
    "become more important than synchrotron and inverse compton cooling , which grow stronger at high energies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "any cr escape , whether diffusive or advective , also becomes more important relative to synchrotron at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron radio spectrum should flatten at low frequencies and steepen at high frequencies .",
    "indeed , this behaviour is often seen in the radio spectra of starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detailed radio spectra are useful in constructing models of the cosmic ray population , helping to constrain the poorly understood magnetic field strength ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "low frequency synchrotron emission might also betray the presence of a ` pion bump ' in the @xmath1 spectrum , in which the spectrum of secondary @xmath1 from pion decay falls off due to the kinematics of pion production in proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "these processes are expected to be particularly important in starburst regions @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "our ability to understand the low frequency radio spectrum of starbursts is limited by other processes that alter the radio spectrum .",
    "the most important is free - free absorption by the ionized gas in galaxies .",
    "the galactic radio spectrum has a turnover at @xmath5 , largely caused by free - free absorption in the diffuse warm ionized medium ( wim ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "free - free absorption is even more important along lines of sight through dense h ii regions , which can become optically thick even at ghz frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , free - free absorption can also flatten the low frequency radio spectra of starbursts .",
    "the spectral curvature of starburst galaxies has therefore been interpreted as free - free absorption ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , there has been relatively little work on the theory of the low frequency radio spectra of starburst galaxies . for model",
    "fitting , if free - free absorption is even considered at all , the typical assumption is the uniform slab model , in which both the free - free absorption and emission come from a uniform density ionized medium pervading the synchrotron - emitting region ( for examples of uniform slabs used to fit starburst radio spectra , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the best current measurements are at ghz frequencies , where the integrated free - free absorption is often expected to be small and the details of the absorption may not matter much , although it has been claimed to be important at ghz frequencies in arp 220 and other ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite . however , from a theoretical point of view , this approximation is likely to be too simple : even in the milky way , the free - free absorption largely comes from the wim , but the free - free emission comes from compact h ii regions .    unlike the milky way and other normal star - forming galaxies",
    ", the h ii regions could actually dominate the free - free absorption within starburst regions . although much of the gas mass in normal galaxies is warm gas ( both neutral and ionized ) , theories of starburst ism suggest this is not the case in these intense regions . instead , it is more likely that the starburst volume is filled by either the hot ( @xmath6 ) plasma excavated out by supernovae that forms into the wind ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or by the dense ( @xmath7 ) molecular gas that makes up most of the mass ( @xcite ) . in the hot wind ,",
    "ionizing photons escape readily without interacting with the neutral gas ; in the molecular gas , they could be stopped too quickly by the enormous absorbing columns .",
    "another hurdle for the formation of a wim is the extraordinary pressures within starburst regions ( @xmath8 in m82 ) .",
    "observationally , in starburst regions , at least part of the free - free absorption is directly observed to come from discrete h ii regions , as seen in the galactic centre at 74 and 333 mhz @xcite , and in m82 @xcite . finally , the low frequency spectra of some supernova remnants in m82 do not show evidence of free - free absorption @xcite , which is consistent with the absorption being patchy .",
    "the alternative is to consider absorption from a collection of discrete h ii regions in starbursts .",
    "a simple version of this approach has been considered in the context of radio recombination line studies , where the radio spectrum is needed to calculate stimulated emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the usual assumption in these models is that all of the h ii regions have the same density , temperature , and radius , and are located in the midplane of a starburst disc .",
    "each h ii region then shadows the synchrotron - emitting region behind it ; with this assumption , the free - free absorption can be predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the model does not work well when the h ii regions are both optically thick and have a covering fraction near 100% @xcite , and it does not allow for h ii regions of different radii .",
    "in this paper , i study effects on the low frequency spectra of starbursts .",
    "i focus on free - free absorption from h ii regions , the most important process , but i also check whether other processes are important .",
    "i calculate in section  [ sec : scenarios ] the amount of free - free absorption by assuming it comes from discrete h ii regions around ob stars stellar clusters in starbursts .",
    "in essence , i use a ` raisin pudding'-like model of starbursts : the dark , opaque strmgren spheres are mixed in with a surrounding ( transparent ) volume - filling medium .",
    "my model generalizes the approach of @xcite to h ii regions of different radii and lets optically thick h ii regions have high covering fraction .",
    "i make spectral fits using these model to the low frequency radio spectrum of m82 in section  [ sec : m82fit ] , accounting for the possibility of spectral curvature .",
    "i check the range of validity of the models by computing whether free - free absorption from diffuse ionized gas , the razin effect , or synchrotron self - absorption , cuts off the low frequency spectrum in section  [ sec : starburstradioend ] .",
    "some details of the calculations are presented in the appendices .",
    "the nonthermal continuum radio emission of starbursts are thought to pervade the entire starburst region , because the radiating cosmic rays can diffuse from their acceleration sites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the h ii regions are intermixed in the starburst region , so in this sense the uniform slab model is correct .",
    "a model of truly uniform ionized gas assumes the free - free absorption comes from a low density , high filling factor medium , one with a low turnover frequency but is highly opaque below that frequency .",
    "however , a more appropriate assumption is that there is a uniform density of h ii regions rather than of ionized gas .",
    "a uniform collection of discrete h ii regions is a high density , low filling factor medium , with a higher turnover frequency , but potentially translucent below that frequency .",
    "i show in appendix  [ sec : derivation ] that the absorption from h ii regions can be parametrized with an absorption coefficient , @xmath9 in this equation , @xmath10 is a distribution function over some parameter(s ) @xmath11 that gives the number of each type of h ii region per unit volume , and @xmath12 is an effective absorbing cross section for that type of h ii region .",
    "the simplest possible assumption is that h ii regions are uniform density strmgren spheres , with a radius of @xmath13 for an ionizing photon injection rate @xmath14 per h ii region .",
    "the recombination constant @xmath15 is equal to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "i assume that the strmgren spheres are completely ionized inside @xmath17 and are completely neutral outside @xmath17 .",
    "i summarize the absorption and emission properties of strmgren spheres in appendix  [ sec : stromgrenradiative ] .",
    "equation  [ eqn : sigmatranslucentsphere ] gives the effective cross section of a uniform density sphere with some absorptivity .",
    "note the free - free absorption coefficient within each strmgren sphere , if it is fully ionized hydrogen plasma ( with @xmath18 ) , is @xmath19 with the gaunt factor @xmath20 usually having a value near @xmath21 for @xmath22 plasma at mhz frequencies @xcite .",
    "is @xmath23 , from @xcite . ]",
    "the other necessary ingredient is the distribution function @xmath10 , which depends on the number and properties of ionizing sources .",
    "i consider strmgren spheres surrounding several possible types of ionizing sources : identical sources with the same luminosity , individual stars in a realistic stellar population , or stellar clusters that either shine at a constant luminosity for some time and shut off or fade more realistically .",
    "suppose that all of the ionizing sources have the same ionizing luminosity , and the h ii regions around them have the same physical properties ( e.g. , temperature , density ) .",
    "for example , a common order of magnitude estimate for a typical ob star s ionizing photon luminosity is @xmath24 .    for a long - lived ( @xmath25 )",
    "continuous starburst , @xcite finds the ionizing photon luminosity as @xmath26 assuming solar metallicity and a salpeter mass function from 0.1 to @xmath27 .",
    "i divide the total ionizing photon flux of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : qwsfr ] by @xmath14 to get    the number of ionizing sources in the galaxy : @xmath28    the strmgren radius around each source is @xmath29 therefore , each h ii region becomes optically thick ( @xmath30 ) when @xmath31    if the strmgren spheres are in a uniform density medium , then all of the spheres are the same size , and the effective absorption coefficient is very simply @xmath32 . at low frequencies , when the h ii regions are all opaque ( @xmath33 ) , i find @xmath34 for example , in the starburst m82 with @xmath35 and average densities of @xmath36 , there would be @xmath37 on any line of sight before hitting an h ii region",
    ". since the typical line of sight through m82 has length @xmath38 , about @xmath39 of the low frequency flux would be transmitted at low frequencies .",
    "of course , this assumes that all of the extreme uv flux ionizes gas , but some may be absorbed by dust or escape the starburst entirely .    .",
    "this plot shows the case when all ionizing sources have @xmath40.[fig : alphaeffwnuindiv],width=340 ]    in figure  [ fig : alphaeffwnuindiv ] , i show the effective absorption coefficient from strmgren spheres around simple sources for densities @xmath41 .",
    "the absorption coefficients reach a plateau at low frequency , with a value that depends on hydrogen density . at high frequencies ,",
    "the absorption coefficients for different hydrogen densities all have the same value . in this case , the cross section of each strmgren sphere with volume @xmath42 is @xmath43 ( section  [ sec : effectivesigma ] ) , which does not depend on density",
    ".      stars in real stellar populations have differing ionizing photon luminosities , which means that the strmgren spheres can have differing sizes",
    ". the distribution function of @xmath14 can be calculated by combining a model stellar population with the ionizing photon luminosity of each type of star . to this end",
    "i ran starburst99 models , described in detail in appendix  [ sec : popindivdist ] .    using the distribution function from appendix  [ sec : popindivdist ] , i compute the @xmath44 of strmgren spheres of uniform density and a constant temperature as @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficients as functions of frequency are depicted in figure  [ fig : alphaeffwnupopindiv ] for @xmath46 . at low frequencies ,",
    "the coefficient asymptotes to @xmath47 this is similar to the low frequency value in the simple source model ( equation  [ eqn : simplesourcealpha ] ) . the main difference with the simple sources model is at intermediate frequencies , as the h ii regions start becoming transparent .",
    "since the strmgren spheres have differing radii in this scenario , the transition from opaqueness to transparency is spread over a larger frequency range .    .",
    "this plot shows the case for a realistic population of o , b , and wolf - rayet stars.[fig : alphaeffwnupopindiv],width=340 ]      much of the star - formation in starburst galaxies occurs in bound super star clusters ( sscs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sscs have a mass function that can be described with a schecter mass function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a cutoff mass that is around @xmath50 in starbursts @xcite , and the mass function applies only above a lower mass limit @xmath51 , which i take to be @xmath52 .",
    "now we must relate the stellar mass of each ssc ( of a given age ) with an ionizing photon luminosity .",
    "the simplest evolution of @xmath53 is that it is constant for some time @xmath54 and then instantly shuts off .",

    "when @xmath59 and @xmath68 , i find @xmath69 the absorption coefficient is smaller than in the case of each ob star having its own strmgren sphere . the reason can be understood if we assume each cluster has @xmath70 ob stars , each with the same ionizing luminosity .",
    "since the strmgren radius increases only as @xmath71 , the cross section of each h ii region increases only as @xmath72 .",
    "the number of strmgren spheres instead decreases as @xmath73 , meaning the effective absorption coefficient is proportional to @xmath74 : clustered stars are not as effective at obscuration .",
    "essentially , clustering preserves the filling factor that is ionized , but since the ionized regions are spatially correlated  the ionized regions at the front of a large h ii region already obscures the ionized volume behind it ",
    "the covering factor is decreased .    .",
    "this plot shows the case when stars are all within ` simple ' sscs surrounded by h ii regions , in which the ionizing photon luminosity of a ssc remains constant for @xmath55 and then shuts off .",

    "the @xmath44 values are indeed lower than in the case of individual stars , but the functional form is basically the same , with a plateau at low frequencies that depends on hydrogen density and an asymptotic form at high frequencies that is independent of hydrogen density .",
    "my assumption in the previous subsection  that sscs behave like light bulbs , emitting ionizing photons for some time before shutting off  is simplistic .",
    "in fact , with stellar population models like starburst99 , it is possible to predict how the ionizing photon generation rate evolves for stellar populations of various ages @xcite . in principle",
    ", one can then use a known star - formation history to accurately predict the cluster mass and age distribution function , and then integrate the cross sections to get an effective absorption coefficient .",

    "determining the amount of free - free absorption in starburst regions has several important applications .",
    "the first is to accurately measure the underlying synchrotron spectrum . the spectral index and spectral curvature constrain the lifetime and sources of ghz - emitting cr @xmath1 , which may be very different at low frequencies and in the extreme environments in starburst regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shape of the synchrotron spectrum is also necessary for the interpretation of radio recombination line observations .",
    "another motivation is to understand the properties of the ionized gas that is responsible for free - free absorption .",
    "in particular , the thermal pressure can be calculated from the density and temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this thermal pressure is much smaller than the known pressure of other ism phases in starbursts , this is evidence for nonthermal support ( for example , by turbulence ; c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the ionized gas contributes to the free - free emission .",
    "knowledge of the amount of free - free emission helps constrain the synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the free - free emission has been proposed as an accurate star - formation rate indicator , since it is traces the ionizing photon generation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "i fit models to m82 s radio spectrum , extracting information on these properties .",
    "my primary purpose here is to demonstrate how low frequency radio spectra can be fit with the new free - free absorption models .",
    "i ignore possible instrumental effects like beam sizes .",
    "i also make no attempt to derive errors on the parameters , because my predicted fluxes have non - linear dependences on parameters .",
    "future studies can address these shortcomings .",
    "the brightest starburst in the radio sky is m82 .",
    "located @xmath87 away ( as adopted in this section from @xcite , although @xcite measure a distance of 3.9 mpc ) , it has a total infrared luminosity of @xmath88 @xcite , corresponding to a salpeter imf star - formation rate of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "most of the radio and infrared emission comes from a region of radius @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the starburst is viewed essentially edge - on from earth . unlike the other bright starburst , ngc 253 @xcite ,",
    "a large fraction of the radio emission comes from the starburst itself rather than the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is especially important at low frequencies , where galaxies are frequently unresolved : the starburst may be obscured by its own h ii regions , but the host galaxy is likely to be unobscured down to @xmath91 .",
    "i consider two sets of flux measurements .",
    "one spans 22.5 mhz to 92 ghz where the starburst of m82 is unresolved .",
    "the other includes the data of @xcite where the starburst region itself is resolved and with frequencies 330 mhz to 10 ghz ; i add high frequency flux measurements at 20 - 100 ghz to this data set .    _ the total unresolved spectrum of m82 _  @xcite obtained high quality radio observations in the 1  7 ghz range using the allen telescope array ( ata ) .",
    "they find that the nonthermal radio spectrum is relatively flat ( @xmath92 ) and curved , becoming steeper at higher frequencies .",

    "@xcite do not include single - dish observations in their modelling .",
    "they argue that since the largest angular scale of the interferometric observations is @xmath93 , the interferometric observations should not resolve out diffuse emission in the starburst core ( with a diameter of @xmath94 ) .",
    "the greatest disparity between the interferometric and single - dish observations is at 23 ghz where the flux is @xmath95 greater in a effelsberg 100 metre single dish observation than in a vla observation .",
    "i include the single - dish observations in my fits for two reasons : ( 1 ) the offset is fairly small compared to the uncertainty in the amount of free - free emission and ( 2 ) the high frequency data is relatively sparse .",
