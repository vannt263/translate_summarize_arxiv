    "the common envelope ( ce ) phase is a key formation process of all compact binary systems , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and double white dwarf binaries .",
    "such systems typically have orbital separations of a few solar radii , and yet require orbital separations of between approximately 10 and 1000 r@xmath3 to accommodate the giant progenitor primary star .",
    "@xcite first suggested that the ce phase is responsible for removing large amounts of orbital energy and angular momentum from the progenitor system , causing a significant reduction in the orbital separation between the two stellar components ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the pre - ce phase of evolution , the initially more massive stellar component ( which we henceforth denote as the primary ) evolves off the main sequence first .",
    "depending on the orbital separation of the binary , the primary will fill its roche lobe on either the red giant or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and initiate mass transfer .",
    "if the giant primary possesses a deep convective envelope [ i.e. the convective envelope has a mass of more than approximately 50 per cent of the giant s mass ; @xcite ] , the giant will expand in response to rapid mass loss . as a result , the giant s radius expands relative to its roche lobe radius , increasing the mass transfer rate . as a consequence of this run - away situation , mass transfer commences on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the companion main - sequence star ( henceforth the secondary ) can not incorporate this material into its structure quickly enough and therefore expands to fill its own roche lobe .",
    "the envelope eventually engulfs both the core of the primary and the main - sequence secondary .    during the spiral - in phase ,",
    "if enough orbital energy is imparted to the ce before the stellar components merge , then the ce may be ejected from the system leaving the core of the primary ( now the white dwarf ) and the secondary star at a greatly reduced separation .",
    "we term such systems post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) . in the present study",
    ", we consider pcebs which have a white dwarf primary component , and a main sequence secondary companion .    modelling the ce phase",
    "presents a major computational challenge , and can only be adequately accomplished via three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "even this approach , however , still can not cope with the large dynamic range of time and length scales involved during the ce phase .",
    "clearly , such hydrodynamical simulations are too computationally intensive to be included in full binary or population synthesis codes .",
    "instead , such codes resort to parameterisations of the ce phase .",
    "one such parametrization describes the ce phase in terms of a simple energy budget argument .",
    "a fraction @xmath0 of the orbital energy released as the binary orbit tightens , @xmath4 , is available to unbind the giant s envelope from the core .",
    "hence , if the change in the envelope s binding energy is @xmath5 , we have ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath6 the efficiency @xmath0 is a free parameter with values @xmath1 ( although values of @xmath7 are discussed ) .",
    "however , the value of @xmath0 is poorly constrained as a result of our equally poor understanding of the physics underlying the ce phase .",
    "an alternative formulation in terms of the angular momentum budget of the binary was suggested by @xcite from their investigation into the formation of double white dwarf binaries , which they assumed occurred from two ce phases .",
    "they suggested that the relative change in the binary s total angular momentum , @xmath8 , and the relative change in the binary s total mass , @xmath9 , during the ce phase are related by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the specific angular momentum removed from the binary by the ejected ce in units of the binary s initial specific angular momentum .",
    "@xcite found that a value of @xmath12 could account for all observed pcebs .",
    "this alternative description was prompted by the fact that for double white dwarf binaries a value of @xmath13 was needed to describe the first ce phase , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "this indicates that the orbital energy increases during the first phase of mass transfer , with a corresponding increase in the orbital separation . in light of this",
    ", @xcite suggested that the first phase of mass transfer is quasi - conservative , and does not give rise to a ce phase .",
    "however , the angular momentum budget approach predicts pceb local space densities that are approximately a factor of ten larger than observed estimates @xcite .",
    "it also predicts that the number of systems increases towards longer orbital periods , with a maximum number of systems at approximately 1000 d @xcite .",
    "this is contrary to observations , which show that there is a maximum number of pcebs with orbital periods of about 1 d @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the angular momentum budget approach has far less predictive power than the energy budget description ; a tightly constrained value of @xmath11 can not constrain the parameters of the possible progenitors of observed systems , while the energy budget approach is more promising in this respect @xcite .",
    "the energy budget approach therefore appears to be the more favourable approach .",
    "however , a few major unresolved issues have yet to be overcome if we are to make significant progress in understanding and modelling the ce phase .",
    "the first issue is that we require @xmath7 to account for some observed systems such as the double white dwarf binary pg 1115 + 166 @xcite and the white dwarf - main sequence pceb ik peg @xcite .",
    "this indicates that an energy source in addition to gravitational energy is being exploited during the ce ejection process that is not accounted for in the standard energy budget formulation such as thermal energy and recombination energy of ionized material within the giant s envelope @xcite .",
    "the second issue is that previous studies into the formation and evolution of white dwarf binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have assumed that @xmath0 is a global constant , i.e. @xmath0 is the same for all progenitor systems , irrespective of their parameters upon entering the ce phase .",
    "this may be a somewhat nave assumption .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that @xmath0 may depend upon the internal structure of the roche lobe filling primary progenitor .    in this spirit ,",
    "@xcite calculated the present - day population of pcebs and cvs if @xmath0 is a function of the secondary mass .",
    "they considered both a power - law dependence ( i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is some power ) , and a dependence of @xmath0 on a cut - off mass . if the secondary mass was below this cut - off limit , then a merger between the two stellar components is assumed to be unavoidable ( formally @xmath16 in this case ) .",
    "as @xcite found , however , these formalisms tend to underestimate @xmath0 for pcebs with low - mass secondaries ( @xmath17 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "for example even though a @xmath18 dependence could account for ik peg , it predicts that systems with @xmath19 m@xmath3 can not survive the ce phase .",
    "this is in conflict with observations that show that pcebs with secondary masses as low as @xmath20 m@xmath3 do exist .    during the preparation of this paper",
    ", we became aware of similar studies being carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied the ce reconstruction method described by @xcite to the observed sample of pcebs .",
    "they investigated whether @xmath0 depended on either the secondary mass or the orbital period immediately after the ce phase .",
    "they concluded that there was no dependence in either case .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on a qualitative , ` by - eye ' , analysis .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found evidence that @xmath0 increases with increasing mass of the progenitor primary star , but decreases with increasing mass of the secondary .",
    "however , they only considered pcebs which underwent negligible angular momentum loss since emerging from the ce phase , which limited their sample size to 30 systems .",
    "our investigation is similar to these studies , except that we investigate whether @xmath0 can be treated as a first - order function of a combination of the binary parameters  white dwarf mass , progenitor primary mass and orbital period at the start of the ce phase , secondary mass and post - ce orbital period  by performing multi - regression analysis .",
    "our method for reconstructing the ce phase for the observed pceb sample is similar to that used by @xcite , but has been independently developed .",
    "the aim is to determine whether correlations exist between @xmath0 and the binary parameters .",
    "the resulting fits will then be useful recipes for binary evolution and population synthesis codes .",
    "such fits may also be useful to ce theoreticians in order to inform and constrain their models .",
    "our pceb sample consists of systems contained in the @xcite catalogue , edition 7.14 ( 2010 ) and the 34 new pcebs detected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , in contrast to @xcite . for an in - depth review of this sample",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our method for reconstructing the ce phase for the observed sample of pcebs .",
    "our results are then given in section 3 , which are then discussed in section 4 .",
    "we then compare our work with similar studies carried out by @xcite and @xcite in section 5 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "in the following subsections , we describe the energy budget equation describing the ce phase in more detail .",
    "we then explain how we can calculate the orbital separation of the system immediately after the ce phase from the cooling age of the white dwarf and the assumed angular momentum loss rate .",
    "finally , we discuss how we use our population synthesis code biseps , to evolve the possible progenitors of a given observed system through the ce phase .",
    "we then use the energy budget equation ( c.f .",
    "[ ebind_1 ] ) to solve for @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the binding energy of the primary s envelope , @xmath21 , using : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the progenitor primary , @xmath24 is the envelope mass and @xmath25 is the radius of the primary , which is also equal to its roche lobe radius at the start of the ce phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the ratio between the approximate expression of the gravitational binding energy given by eqn .",
    "( [ ebind_4 ] ) and the exact expression : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the core mass ( i.e. the mass of the proto - white dwarf ) and @xmath29 is the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath30 . alternatively , if we consider the internal energy of the envelope , we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy per unit mass , and @xmath33 is the fraction of thermal energy which is used to unbind the envelope @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 for observed systems by adopting either eqn .",
    "( [ ebind_g ] ) ( @xmath34 ) or eq .",
    "( [ ebind_b ] ) ( @xmath35 ) to calculate @xmath26 in eqn .",
    "( [ ebind_4 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we follow @xcite and assume that @xmath36 for this case .    for a binary system which has an initial orbital separation @xmath37 immediately before the ce phase ( i.e. at the point when the primary giant just fills its roche lobe ) , and an orbital separation @xmath38 immediately after the ce phase ( i.e. the point when the pceb emerges from the ce phase ) , the change in orbital energy is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the secondary star .",
    "generally , the observed orbital separation of a pceb is not the same as the orbital separation immediately after the ce phase .",
    "this is because the pceb would have undergone orbital period evolution due to angular momentum losses via gravitational radiation or magnetic braking since emerging from the ce phase .",
    "we therefore follow @xcite to calculate the orbital period of our observed sample of pcebs immediately after their emergence from the ce phase , @xmath43 , using the cooling time of the white dwarf , @xmath44 .",
    "we apply the disrupted magnetic braking paradigm @xcite and assume that magnetic braking is ineffective for secondaries that have masses less than the fully convective mass limit for main sequence stars , @xmath45 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , for observed pcebs with @xmath46 , we assume that the systems are driven purely by gravitational wave radiation .",
    "we therefore calculate @xmath43 according to equation ( 8) of @xcite : @xmath47    the evolution of observed systems with @xmath48 will be driven by a combination of gravitational radiation and magnetic braking . in this investigation , we adopt the magnetic braking formalism given by @xcite . however , we can neglect the contribution due to gravitational radiation because the associated angular momentum loss rate is much less than that associated with magnetic braking . to calculate @xmath43",
    "we therefore apply @xmath49 where @xmath43 , @xmath50 and @xmath44 are expressed in yr , and @xmath51 is expressed in r@xmath52 m@xmath53 yr@xmath54 .",
    "we also include a normalisation factor @xmath55 in order to obtain an angular momentum loss rate that is appropriate for the observed width and location of the cv period gap @xcite .",
    "we estimate the convective envelope mass of the secondary star as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "note that equation ( [ mconv ] ) calculates the convective envelope mass for a star on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "in reality , the mass of the convective envelope is a function of the fraction of the main sequence lifetime that the star has passed through ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , thus making equation ( [ mconv ] ) time dependent and the solution to @xmath43 in equation ( [ tcool_hurley ] ) non - trivial .",
    "the biseps code employs the single star evolution formulae by @xcite and a binary evolution scheme based on that described by @xcite .",
    "we evolve a large number of binary systems initially consisting of two zams stellar components .",
    "the stars are assumed to have a population i chemical composition and the orbits are circular at all times .",
    "the initial secondary mass is equal to the observed secondary mass of the observed pceb we are considering . the initial primary masses and orbital periods are obtained from a two - dimensional grid consisting of 1000 logarithmically spaced points in both primary mass and orbital period .",
    "the initial primary masses are in the range of 0.1 to 20 m@xmath3 , while the initial orbital periods are in the range of 0.1 to 100000 d. hence , we evolve @xmath57 binaries for a maximum evolution time of 10 gyr . for symmetry reasons only systems where @xmath58 are evolved .",
    "prior to the onset of the ce phase , the primary star will lose mass via stellar winds . for stars on and after the main sequence , mass loss rates",
    "are calculated using the formalism described by @xcite . the super - wind phase on the agb",
    "is calculated using the prescription described by @xcite .",
    "if a binary configuration undergoes a ce phase , and the mass of the primary core is equal to the observed white dwarf mass within the observed uncertainty then we can use eqn .",
    "( [ alpha_6 ] ) to calculate @xmath0 for that system . for each progenitor",
    ", we calculate @xmath59 or @xmath60 by linear interpolating between values tabulated by @xcite . we extended this table using full stellar models calculated by the eggleton code ( provided by marc van der sluys , private communication ) and the ez stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details .    for a given",
    "observed pceb , we now have a range of possible values of @xmath0 , each corresponding to a possible progenitor system .",
    "a value of @xmath0 is given a weighting equal to the formation probability of the associated progenitor system .",
    "the formation probability for a progenitor can be found from the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the zams primary mass ( see eqn . [ imf ] ) , and from the initial orbital period distribution @xmath63 , which can be found by using the initial orbital separation distribution ( iosd ) , @xmath64 ( see eqn . [ iosd ] ) , via kepler s third law .",

    "@xcite find that the binding energy of the envelope is positive if the radius of the primary giant star is sufficiently large , formally indicated by a value of @xmath67 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the magnitude of the radiation pressure exceeds the gravitational force . as a result , the prescription given by eqn .",
    "( [ alpha_6 ] ) breaks down , and we can not follow the evolution of such progenitors through the ce phase using the energy budget formalism ( the implications of @xmath67 is discussed in more detail in section [ section : discussion ] ) . therefore , progenitor binaries of a given pceb with such primary giants are discounted in the aforementioned weighting calculation .    for the secondary mass ,",
