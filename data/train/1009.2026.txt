    "<S> zigzag graphene nanoribbons patterned on graphane are studied using spin - polarized ab initio calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the electronic and magnetic properties of the graphene / graphane superlattice strongly depends on the degree of hydrogenation at the interfaces between the two materials . </S>",
    "<S> when both zigzag interfaces are fully hydrogenated , the superlattice behaves like a freestanding zigzag graphene nanoribbon , and the magnetic ground state is antiferromagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> when one of the interfaces is half hydrogenated , the magnetic ground state becomes ferromagnetic , and the system is very close to being a half metal with possible spintronics applications whereas the magnetic ground state of the superlattice with both interfaces half hydrogenated is again antiferromagnetic . in this last case </S>",
    "<S> , both edges of the graphane nanoribbon also contribute to the total magnetization of the system . </S>",
    "<S> all the spin - polarized ground states are semiconducting , independent of the degree of hydrogenation of the interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the ab initio results are supplemented by a simple tight - binding analysis that captures the main qualitative features . </S>",
    "<S> our ab initio results show that patterned hydrogenation of graphene is a promising way to obtain stable graphene nanoribbons with interesting technological applications . </S>"
