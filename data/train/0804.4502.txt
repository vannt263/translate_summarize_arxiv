    "the most striking feature of the laughlin state describing the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect at filling fraction @xmath1 @xcite is the appearance of quasi - particle excitations with fractional charge and fractional statistics .",
    "the idea of particles that do not behave as fermions or bosons , something that can occur in two spatial dimensions , is still a reason for wonder , and a motivation for seeking phases of matter with exotic excitations in low dimensions .",
    "the laughlin wavefunction served as a foundation to explain all the odd - denominator incompressible fqh states @xcite .",
    "however , it does not include the possibility of an even - denominator state .",
    "therefore , the quantum hall plateau observed at @xmath0 @xcite poses a special challenge .",
    "while various theories have been proposed for this state @xcite , much of the excitement has been generated by the possibility that it is a non - abelian topological state . in ground - breaking work , moore and read @xcite proposed the pfaffian wavefunction as a description of electrons in an incompressible half - filled landau level .",
    "@xcite conjectured that this ground - state may be realized at @xmath0 .",
    "recently , it was noted that there is another possible state , the so - called anti - pfaffian @xcite , which would be degenerate in energy with the pfaffian state in the absence of landau level mixing . since excitations above both the pfaffian @xcite and anti - pfaffian @xcite ground - states are non - abelian anyons ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the @xmath0 plateau can be a platform for topological quantum computation .",
    "therefore , determining the nature of the @xmath0 state has gained additional urgency , beyond fqh physics @xcite .    in order to set a context for the importance of our theoretical numerical study of the 5/2 spin polarization question",
    ", we first briefly describe the highly confusing experimental status of the subject . immediately following the original discovery of the 5/2 fqhe , eisenstein et al .",
    "@xcite found that the application of a modest in - plane magnetic field destroys the fqhe .",
    "this was interpreted quite naturally as direct evidence for the 5/2 fqh state being spin - unpolarized , leading to proposed spin - singlet wavefunctions @xcite describing the 5/2 fqh state which , however , turned out to have very poor overlap with the exact numerical wavefunction .",
    "all subsequent measurements @xcite of the 5/2 fqhe in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field have verified its suppression in the presence of even a weak in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "the most direct interpretation of such an in - plane field induced destruction of the 5/2 fqhe as arising from the zeeman splitting induced spin - polarization effect ( i.e. the original unpolarized fqh state becoming spin - polarized under the in - plane field ) becomes questionable , however , when one realizes that experimentally the 5/2 fqhe is observed over a very large range of perpendicular magnetic fields , ranging from 2 t @xcite to 12 t @xcite , and therefore , the 5/2 fqhe can obviously survive very large spin - polarizations !",
    "a more plausible scenario is that the in - plane magnetic field induced destruction of the 5/2 spin polarization arises @xcite from the orbital coupling @xcite of the in - plane field and not at all from the zeeman coupling which depends on the total magnetic field .",
    "efforts @xcite to directly measure the 5/2 spin - polarization through the resistive nmr technique have so far been unsuccessful although similar measurements @xcite at @xmath2 in the lowest landau level have unambiguously established the spin - unpolarized ( or partially - polarized ) nature of the ( non - fqh ) 1/2 state in weak magnetic fields ( up to 5 - 8 t , much higher than magnetic fields where the 5/2 fqhe is routinely observed ) . taken together , all of this experimental evidence provides a highly conflicting picture for the spin - polarization of the 5/2 fqh state , with both spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized ( certainly partially - polarized ) states being plausible , particularly at low magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of non - abelian quasiparticles at @xmath0 depends on ( at least ) the following premises : ( i ) coulomb repulsion in the second ll ( sll ) has a form conducive to pairing and ( ii ) the electrons are fully spin - polarized .",
    "there is strong evidence from numerics that ( i ) is satisfied @xcite ( especially when finite layer thickness is taken into account @xcite ) .",
    "recent experiments which are consistent with a quasiparticle charge @xmath3 @xcite give further support to this hypothesis , but can not rule out abelian paired states which also could have @xmath3 quasiparticle charge .",
    "however , there is less evidence that ( ii ) holds . in gaas ,",
    "the zeeman energy is approximately 50 times smaller than the cyclotron energy as a result of effective mass and @xmath4-factor renormalizations",
    ", so the magnetic field need not fully polarize the electron spins . electron - electron interactions , which are roughly comparable to the cyclotron energy in current experiments at @xmath0 , ( or even larger , see ref . [ ] ) can , therefore , determine the spin physics of the ground - state ( which is what happens at @xmath5 , where the ground - state would be spontaneously polarized even if the zeeman energy were precisely zero ) . while the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states are fully spin - polarized , there are also paired states which are not fully - polarized @xcite , such as the so - called @xmath6 state",
    ". therefore , the experiments observing charge @xmath3 quasiparticles do not rule them out .",
    "experiments which seek to directly probe the spin polarization at @xmath0 are inconclusive @xcite . since the proposed non - abelian states , whether the pfaffian or the anti - pfaffian , are all fully spin - polarized whereas the competing spin - unpolarized states ( e.g. the hollow - core state or the ( 331 ) state ) are all abelian , it becomes imperative that the issue of 5/2 spin - polarization is resolved by a serious numerical calculation , which is what we achieve in this work .",
    "for the last 25 years numerical methods have had strong predictive power in the study of fqh systems , and have become a fundamental validation tool for theories . in a seminal paper@xcite , morf showed that in a half - filled sll , the fully polarized state has lower energy than the spin singlet state in systems of up to 12 electrons .",
    "based on this result , he argued that the electrons in the sll are fully polarized at @xmath0 , which ran counter to the prevalent view at the time ( based on tilted - field experiments @xcite ) .",
    "later , park _ et al _ @xcite compared the energies of different ground - state candidates , and concluded that a polarized pfaffian is favored against a polarized composite fermion ( cf ) sea , and unpolarized composite fermion sea .",
    "recently , dimov _ et al _ @xcite reached the same conclusion by comparing the pfaffian and halperin s ( 3,3,1 ) state @xcite using variational monte carlo .",
    "in all these works , all trial states have energies that are substantially higher than the unpolarized ground - state energy at @xmath0 obtained by morf .",
    "the existing numerical evidence suggests that the half - filled sll is either fully - polarized , or partially - polarized .",
    "however , the latter possibility has not been explored , probably due to numerical limitations . in this work",
    "we overcome these limitations by combining exact diagonalization with the recently introduced density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) for studying fqh states on the spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "this dmrg approach relies on concepts of exact diagonalization and numerical renormalization group , and yields variational results in a reduced basis , in the form of a matrix - product state .",
    "contrary to other variational methods , it does not rely on an ansatz or prior knowledge of a trial wavefunction .",
    "the obtained energies are quasi - exact , in the sense that the accuracy is under control , and improves as the number of states in the basis is increased@xcite .",
    "we have typically used @xmath7 dmrg states , which exploits the limits of our computational capability .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes a landau level is dictated by the coulomb interaction between electrons , making this the quintessential strongly correlated problem . in the spherical geometry ,",
    "it is written in an angular momentum representation , which is parametrized by haldane s pseudopotentials @xmath8 @xcite that describe the interaction between two electrons with relative angular momentum @xmath9.@xcite in the lowest ll , @xmath10 dominates , explaining why the laughlin state yields such a good description at @xmath1 , since it is the exact ground - state of a hard - core hamiltonian with @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "however , in the second ll ( sll ) , the relative magnitude of the pseudopotentials is such that @xmath13 becomes comparable to @xmath10 , therefore introducing a competition between pairing and coulomb repulsion , crucial to stabilize the pfaffian .",
    "( notice that even-@xmath9 pseudopotentials only become relevant for partially polarized or unpolarized states ) .",
    "incompressible states at filling fractions @xmath14 are characterized on the sphere by the number of electrons @xmath15 and flux quanta @xmath16 obeying the relation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the so called shift function . the shift for the pfaffian @xmath0 state is @xmath19 , and its particle - hole conjugate ,",
    "the anti - pfaffian , is at @xmath20 . in the absence of landau - level mixing , these states become energetically degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the low - energy spectrum of a system with @xmath21 electrons obtained using exact diagonalization on the sphere at half - filling , with the shift @xmath19 corresponding to the moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian state .",
    "all values are in units of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the magnetic length .",
    "the ground - state is fully magnetized ( @xmath24 ) , and also has the same orbital angular momentum ( @xmath25 ) as the mr state ; the overlap between the numerical ground - state and the mr state in this case is @xmath26 .",
    "we also find that the full magnetization is a robust property of the ground - state when some interaction parameters are varied . in in the same figure we present results of the same system with a slightly modified hamiltonian , in which the @xmath10 pseudopotential is tuned to maximize the overlap between the numerical ground - state and the moore - read state for fully spin - polarized electrons ;",
    "the overlap is @xmath27 in this case .",
    "( notice that the overlaps on the sphere are larger than on the torus @xcite and disk @xcite ) just as in the coulomb case , the ground - state is fully polarized .",
    "what is noteworthy about this spectrum is that the first excited state has @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; this is what we expect for the lowest - energy spin - wave excitation on top of a fully - magnetized ferromagnetic ground - state .",
    "while the spectrum of the coulomb case does not quite show such behavior at this particular system size , we believe it is a finite - size artifact ; we expect for larger system sizes the lowest - energy excitation should be a spin - wave , just as we see for @xmath30 .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we plot the ground - state energies of a system with @xmath21 electrons at half - filling , as a function of the polarization @xmath31 obtained with the dmrg method .",
    "we present results at shift values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , corresponding to the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian respectively , and also , for completeness , at intermediate values .",
    "we have found excellent agreement with exact diagonalization results , with errors in the sixth digit , establishing the accuracy of the technique . in all cases",
    ", the evidence clearly shows that the fully polarized state has lower energy , and that the energy increases monotonically with decreasing polarization . for shifts @xmath32",
    ", the energy differences only appear in the fourth digit .",
    "one possible interpretation is that these values of the shift correspond to excitations above the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian ground - states .",
    "if these excitations were skyrmion - like ( i.e. with many reversed spins ) , we would expect the ground - state at these values of the shift to be a spin - singlets .",
    "the addition of a zeeman energy to the hamiltonian will even more strongly rule out the possibility of an unpolarized or even partially - polarized ground - state , even for the lowest magnetic field ( @xmath333 t ) observation @xcite of the 5/2 fqh state .    in fig.[fig3",
    "] we show the ground - state energy as a function of the number of electrons @xmath15 for different values of the polarization @xmath34 , shift @xmath19 , and zero zeeman splitting .",
    "we have rescaled the energies by a factor @xmath35 to take into account finite - size effects on the sphere , @xcite where we are assuming an underlying inert filled ( @xmath36 ) lowest landau level .",
    "@xcite our data reproduces the results obtained by morf @xcite in smaller systems , and we extend the study to @xmath37 for the unpolarized systems , and @xmath38 for the fully polarized states . for polarization @xmath39 , we study system sizes up to @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the calculations at finite polarization involve a much larger hilbert space .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian now includes terms mixing spin , making these calculations computationally expensive , and preventing us from reaching larger system sizes .",
    "based on extrapolations with the number of dmrg states , we estimate our errors to be @xmath40 for the largest systems considered , which is of the order of the symbol size .",
    "as previously noticed in ref .",
    "[ ] , the results at finite polarizations exhibit very strong finite - size effects .",
    "this makes any attempt to extrapolate energies to the thermodynamic limit unreliable , even using the larger system sizes studied here .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we show the ground - state energy as a function of @xmath41 for a shift @xmath20 , corresponding to the anti - pfaffian .",
    "notice that this calculation involves four more orbitals than the previous case , making it computationally more demanding .",
    "an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit yields a value of @xmath42 , identical to the best available estimate for the pfaffian @xcite , as expected for the particle - hole conjugate state .",
    "interestingly , the partially polarized states show a smoother behavior here than the one observed for @xmath19 , indicating that finite - size effects may play a less important role .",
    "this allows one to estimate the ground - state energy of the unpolarized state in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath43 .",
    "this result is substantially lower than the variational energy for the ( 3,3,1 ) state , @xmath44 , obtained by dimov _",
    "@xcite , indicating that the competing unpolarized state may not be a a known paired state .",
    "in interpreting this data , it is worth remembering that our hamiltonian is fully spin - rotation invariant since we do not keep the zeeman term .",
    "therefore , any polarization which develops is a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking and will be accompanied by gapless goldstone bosons ( i.e. spin waves ) . if the ground - state is fully polarized , then the @xmath45 multiplet will have the lowest energy .",
    "the other multiplets will have energies which are higher by @xmath46 since the spectrum of a ferromagnet is @xmath47 as a consequence of the conservation of the order parameter .",
    "if the ground - state is partially - polarized , then some @xmath48 multiplet will have the lowest energy .",
    "the other multiplets will have energies which are higher by @xmath46 since , again , there is a ferromagnetic order parameter which is conserved .",
    "if the ground - state spontaneously breaks spin - rotational symmetry but does not have a ferromagnetic moment , such as the ( 3,3,1 ) state , then the ground - state in a finite system will be a spin - singlet , but the gap to other multiplets will be @xmath49 since the order parameter is not conserved . finally ,",
    "if the ground - state is a spin - singlet in the thermodynamic limit , then the lowest energy state will have @xmath50 and there will be a finite gap to the other multiplets , even in the @xmath51 limit .",
    "our data is most consistent with a ferromagnetic ground - state . extrapolating to larger system sizes",
    ", we expect that the @xmath45 multiplet will continue to have the lowest energy , but the gap to other multiplets will shrink as @xmath46 .",
    "finally , and for completeness , we calculated the ground - state energies as a function of polarization for a system of @xmath21 electrons , at filling fraction @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the lowest ll . results for different shifts are displayed in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the most striking observation is that the ground - state is partially polarized for all the values of shift considered .",
    "thus , the situation at @xmath2 is very different from filling fraction @xmath0 , as a result of the difference between the effective interaction ( i.e. the pseudopotentials ) in the lowest and second landau levels .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with calculations of the coulomb energies of polarized and unpolarized trial wavefunctions at half - filling of both the lowest@xcite and second@xcite landau levels .",
    "notice that we have set the zeeman energy to zero in this calculation .",
    "since the energy splitting between the partially - polarized states and the full - polarized state is small for shift @xmath52 ( corresponding to the compressible ground state@xcite ) , we expect to be able to tune the system between partially- and fully - polarized compressible ground - states at @xmath2 by increasing the zeeman energy via a tilted field . on the other hand ,",
    "our results lead us to expect that the plateau at @xmath0 is fully spin - polarized even for vanishing zeeman energy .    our numerical results for the @xmath2 state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , are completely in agreement with the experimental findings of refs .",
    "resistive nmr measurements find that the @xmath2 plateau is fully - polarized at high magnetic fields but is not at low magnetic fields , where it is partially - polarized .",
    "since the zeeman energy ( relative to the coulomb energy ) increases with increasing magnetic field , this is consistent with our numerical findings above .",
    "we emphasize that our prediction for the @xmath0 state is the opposite behavior : a fully - spin - polarized ground - state occurs even for zero zeeman energy .",
    "therefore , increasing the zeeman energy will only make a spin - polarized state more stable at @xmath0 and there will not be a zeeman - energy - induced transition , in contrast to @xmath2 .",
    "the dichotomy between @xmath0 and @xmath2 states is understandable since the latter is a compressible state while the former is an incompressible quantized plateau and , therefore , there is no particular reason for them to have similar spin properties in the ground - state . fig .",
    "6 shows the spin @xmath53 of the ground - state at @xmath2 and flux @xmath54 , plotted vs. system size , corresponding to a composite fermion sea .",
    "this pattern is easily seen to follow from hund s first rule of maximizing @xmath53 applied to the angular momentum shells of weakly interacting composite fermions at zero ( effective ) magnetic field .",
    "the data is therefore highly suggestive that in the absence of zeeman gap the @xmath2 cf state is unpolarized .",
    "the only exception to this rule is at @xmath55 where the actual ground - state @xmath53 is 2 ( solid symbol ) .",
    "however , the difference in energy between this and the hund s rule state ( open symbol ) is 0.000085 ( 0.004% of the ground - state energy ) . in all likelihood",
    ", it is caused by the aliasing of the cf state with the particle - hole conjugate of the laughlin state for 3 electrons , which is fully polarized , and should be discounted . setting aside this case , the second hund s",
    "rule@xcite on the angular momentum of the ground - state ( listed in fig .",
    "6 next to the symbols ) appears to hold with one , possibly important , exception for @xmath21 . here",
    "the difference between the actual ground - state at @xmath28 and the hund s rule state @xmath56 ( indicated in parenthesis ) is 0.014% of the ground - state energy and may be more significant .",
    "the pattern of @xmath9 vs. @xmath57 should be 01101102332023320  , which matches that of ref .",
    "[ ] ( if generalized to include spin ) . without further studies ,",
    "it is difficult to conclude whether this signifies a breakdown of hund s second rule or is in fact an isolated exception . whatever the case , it will not alter the spin polarization of the ground - state",
    ".    in conclusion",
    ", we have numerically established that the ground - state of the fqh hamiltonian at filling fraction @xmath0 , even in the zero zeeman energy limit , is fully spin - polarized .",
    "we also find , consistent with experimental findings , that the @xmath2 compressible composite fermion sea state in the lowest landau level is partially spin - polarized at low magnetic fields , but may become fully polarized at higher magnetic fields due to the zeeman energy .",
    "thus , @xmath0 and @xmath2 states have contrasting spin - polarization properties at low to intermediate magnetic fields .",
    "we believe that our results and the recent findings @xcite of the expected topological degeneracy on the torus , when taken together with the observation of charge @xmath3 quasiparticles at @xmath0 @xcite , make a strong case for the @xmath58 state to be non - abelian .",
    "our results should encourage efforts to observe non - abelian anyons at this quantum hall state and use them for topological quantum computation .",
    "we thank i. dimov and r. morf for discussions .",
    "the study of @xmath2 was motivated by conversations with j. eisenstein .",
    "this research has been supported by microsoft station q , the nsf under dmr-0704133 ( k.y . ) and dmr-0411800 ( cn ) , the doe under de - fg03 - 02er-45981 ( ehr ) , and by darpa - quest ( sds and cn ) .",
    "in doing morf s rescaling of the magnetic length ( the so called `` ion disk radius '' ) we add the effects of an inert filled ll to the conventional factor @xmath62 .",
    "either definition is valid , since the rescaling was meant to make the extrapolation to infinite size look smoother . in that limit either factor should lead to identical results ."
