    "entanglement is one of the key features of quantum mechanics , and during the past decades it has been demonstrated experimentally in many different physical systems . by coherent control of interacting quantum systems , entangled states can be engineered directly @xcite . alternatively , entanglement can be established as a consequence of the outcome of a measurement process  either as a continuous ( possibly quantum - non - demolition ( qnd ) ) measurement @xcite or as a consequence of a single quantum jump @xcite .",
    "some of the above examples employ cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite for mediating the interaction between the quantum systems , which allows for the direct engineering of entangled states in the strong - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the present paper considers a different case  the bad - cavity limit of qed , in which the damping rate of the cavity field is fast compared to the coupling rate between qubits and the cavity field .",
    "hence , any information of qubit coherence being encoded into the cavity field will immediately be lost from the cavity and the above - mentioned direct - engineering schemes are inapplicable . however , turning to a measurement - based protocol , the detection of a field transmitted through the cavity allows for re - establishing a firm knowledge of the qubit state and hence for the creation of entangled states through measurement back action .",
    "the measurement is of the continuous type , which is theoretically well - described by stochastic master - equation methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite using similar theoretical methods , our calculations are not restricted to the dispersive and linear regime of the coupling between the cavity field and the qubits but allow instead for a more generalized set of parameters ( even a resonant coupling ) in search for the optimal choice for entanglement generation .",
    "we consider feasible experimental approaches and discuss the physical limitations imposed both fundamentally by the measurement process and practically by decoherence mechanisms .",

    "the physical setup under consideration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cavitysetup ] ) consists of two qubits placed in a cavity subjected to an external driving field and to a continuous measurement by employing a phase - sensitive detection of the field leaking from the cavity .",
    "let the ground and excited states of either qubit be denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and consider the two - qubit basis set @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "our aim is to generate the spin - singlet state , @xmath4 , by a probabilistic detection scheme with a high fidelity and a high success probability .",
    "this state does not couple to the cavity field when the coupling parameter @xmath5 is equal for the two qubits .",
    "the other states , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 span the spin - triplet space and the cavity field may induce rotations within this subset of hilbert space . furthermore , the coupling between the qubits and the cavity field gives rise to a correlated decay mechanism , which induces transitions ( with rate @xmath9 ) within the triplet space : @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while the singlet state , @xmath4 , is unaffected .",
    "the idea is now to prepare a separable initial state , @xmath12 , and subsequently to collapse ( probabilistically ) @xmath12 into @xmath4 by the measurement process .",
    "the separable initial states of opposite spins , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , both have a 50% overlap with the desired singlet state , and our task is to identify a measurement scheme , which is able to distinguish between the singlet and triplet components of @xmath12 and thus to facilitate the state collapse .",
    "no real or virtual transitions can take place within the one dimensional singlet subspace of the qubits and it experiences no interaction with the cavity field .",
    "the triplet subspace , however , consists of three states , and their interaction with the cavity field can be tailored to affect the transmitted radiation field in two different ways : the cavity field and the damping of the spin system via the cavity mode can drive the collective spin to a steady state mean spin polarization which causes a phase shift of the transmitted radiation , or the dynamical driving of the triplet spin components can induce a frequency modulation of the transmitted field auto - correlation function .",
    "the steady state change in the transmitted field is visible in the homodyne photo - current , while the frequency modulation can be observed with a lock - in detector .    , which is driven externally by a constant coherent field , @xmath15 ( in the frame rotating at the driving frequency , @xmath16 ) .",

    "hence , for a sufficiently long measurement time the continuous evolution of @xmath23 effectively facilitates the desired wave - function collapse .",
    "the optimal entanglement - generating protocol simply uses @xmath23 to check to which degree the singlet state , @xmath4 , has been realized . by requiring a minimum value , @xmath98 , for the state overlap , the acceptance criterion for a given quantum state then becomes @xmath99 .",
