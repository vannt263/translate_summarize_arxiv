    "an edge - colored graph @xmath0 is _ rainbow connected _ if any two vertices are connected by a path whose edges have distinct colors . obviously , if @xmath0 is rainbow connected , then it is also connected .",
    "this concept of rainbow connection in graphs was introduced by chartrand et al . in @xcite .",
    "the _ rainbow connection number _ of a connected graph @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath1 , is the smallest number of colors that are needed in order to make @xmath0 rainbow connected .",
    "an easy observation is that if @xmath0 is of order @xmath4 then @xmath5 , since one may color the edges of one spanning tree of @xmath0 with different colors and the remaining edges with colors already used .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath6 if and only if @xmath0 is a complete graph , that @xmath7 if and only if @xmath0 is a tree .",
    "notice that for the cycle @xmath8 of order @xmath4 , @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown that computing the rainbow connection number of an arbitrary graph is np - hard @xcite .",
    "there are some approaches to study the bounds of @xmath1 with respect to the minimum degree @xmath10 . in @xcite caro et al .",

    "@xcite have improved the upper bound of krivelevich and yuster by showing that for every connected graph @xmath0 of order @xmath4 and minimum degree @xmath11 , @xmath16 .    with respect to the the relation between @xmath1 and the connectivity @xmath17 , in @xcite , the author mentioned that hajo broersma asked a question at the iwoca workshop :    what happens with the value @xmath1 for graphs with higher connectivity .",

    "@xcite , we can easily obtain an upper bound of the rainbow connection number : @xmath23 therefore , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in this paper , motivated by the results in @xcite",
    ", we will improve this bound by showing the following result .",
    "[ thm ] if @xmath0 is a @xmath3-connected simple graph with @xmath4 vertices , then @xmath28 .    before proceeding",
    ", we recall the fan lemma , which will be used frequently in the sequel .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath29-connected graph , @xmath30 a vertex of @xmath0 , and let @xmath31 be a set of at least @xmath29 vertices of @xmath0",
    ". then there exists a @xmath29-fan in @xmath0 from @xmath30 to @xmath32 , namely there exists a family of @xmath29 internally disjoint @xmath33-paths whose terminal vertices are distinct in y.",
    "let @xmath34 be a maximal connected subgraph of @xmath0 satisfying that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of vertices of @xmath34 .",
    "we first claim the existence of @xmath34 . if @xmath0 contains a triangle @xmath37 , then we can choose the triangle as @xmath34 , since @xmath38 . if @xmath0 contains @xmath39 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) as a subgraph , then we take @xmath42 , since @xmath43 .",
    "now suppose all the cycles contained in @xmath0 are of length @xmath44 , then we can take @xmath34 as the graph obtained by adding one pendent edge to @xmath45 .",
    "observe that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we next claim that @xmath48 . by contradiction .",
    "suppose there are four distinct vertices outside of @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath49",
    ". then by the fan lemma , each of them has three internally disjoint paths to @xmath34 .",
    "we assume first each of @xmath50 has three neighbors in @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the edges incident to the vertex @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we can add @xmath50 to @xmath34 , and form a lager subgraph @xmath54 with @xmath55 vertices .",
    "now we use only two new colors @xmath56 and @xmath13 to color the @xmath57 edges . assigning color @xmath56 to edges @xmath58 for @xmath59 and color @xmath13 to other @xmath60 edges",
    ". then we have @xmath61 contradicting to the choice of @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that at least one of these four vertices , say @xmath30 , has the property that one of the three internally disjoint @xmath62-paths @xmath63 has length at least two .",
    "furthermore , among all vertices satisfying the above property , we choose vertex @xmath30 such that one of the three paths has length one , say @xmath64 , and that the sum of lengths of @xmath65 and @xmath66 is as large as possible .",
    "denote @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "with loss of generality , we assume @xmath73 , and then @xmath74 . we first assume @xmath75",
    ". we can add @xmath76 to @xmath34 and form a larger subgraph @xmath54 with @xmath77 vertices .",
    "if @xmath78 is even , then we can color the @xmath79 edges of path @xmath80 with @xmath81 new colors . in the first half of the path the colors are all distinct , and the same ordering of colors",
    "is repeated in the second half of the path .",
    "we can color edge @xmath82 with any color already appeared in @xmath34 , and then it is straightforward to verify that @xmath54 is rainbow connected . if @xmath78 is odd , then we can color the @xmath79 edges of path @xmath80 with @xmath83 new colors as follows .",
    "the middle edge of the path and edge @xmath82 get any color that already used in @xmath34 .",
    "the first @xmath83 edges of the path all receive distinct new colors , and in the last @xmath83 edges of the path this coloring is repeated in the same order .",
    "again it is straightforward to verify that @xmath54 is rainbow connected .",
    "we now have @xmath84 contradicting the maximality of @xmath34 .",
    "hence , we only assume @xmath85 .",
    "we consider three cases as follows .",
