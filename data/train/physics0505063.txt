    "for the sake of completeness , we recall here the discussion from @xcite .",
    "its purpose here is to contrast the present approach with some other approaches @xcite to the unification of the ideas of the quantum theory and einstein s general relativity .    in an essence ,",
    "newton s deliberations define @xcite _ specific mathematical structures or fields _ ( scalar , vector , tensor functions ) over the _ metrically flat 3-continuum _ and consider the laws of their transformations .",
    "the 3-continuum admits the _ same euclidean metric structure _ before and after the coordinate transformations .",
    "the ever - flat 3-continuum is , in this sense , an _",
    "absolute space _ and , in newton s theory , accelerations of material bodies can refer only to this absolute space .",
    "furthermore , in newton s theory , physical laws for these quantities are the mathematical statements form - invariant under the galilean coordinate transformations which are basic to the newtonian formulation of mechanics .",
    "mathematical methods @xcite for these _ newtonian _ fields are , evidently , required to be consistent with the underlying flat 3-continuum admitting the same metric structure before and after the transformations of these fields .",
    "_ this is , truly , the sense of any theory being newtonian_.    then , the galilean transformations under which the newtonian laws are form - invariant are , as opposed to general , _ specific _ transformations of the coordinates of the continuum @xmath1 .",
    "newton s theory also attaches _ physical _ meaning to the space coordinates and to the time coordinate . in this theory",
    ", the space coordinate describes the `` physical distance '' separating physical bodies and the time coordinate describes the reading of a `` physical '' clock .",
    "euclidean space is then also the _ physical _ space of newton s theory .",
    "in addition , the ( newtonian ) temporal coordinate has _",
    "universally _ the same value for all the spatial locations , _ ie _ , all synchronized clocks at different spatial locations show and maintain the same time . in other words ,",
    "the newtonian time coordinate is the _ absolute _ physical time .",
    "basically , newton s theory imagines a material body as a point - mass endowed with the inertia of that material body .",
    "it is a primary _ physical _ conception of this theory . necessarily ,",
    "a point - mass moves along a one - dimensional curve of the unchanging euclidean 3-continuum .    in _ physical _ associations of newton s",
    "theory , it is then tacitly assumed that the interaction of a measuring instrument ( observer ) and the object ( a particle whose physical parameters are being measured ) is negligibly small or that the effects of this interaction can be eliminated from the results of observations to obtain , as accurately as desired , the values of these parameters @xcite .",
    "an issue closely related to the above one is that of the causality . given initial data , newton s theory predicts the values of its variables of the point - mass exactly and , hence , assumes strictly causal development of _ its _ physical world .",
    "conceptually , in newton s theory , force is the cause behind motions of material bodies .",
    "next to inertia , force is the second most important of the conceptions of newton s theory .",
    "furthermore , as lorentz had first realized very clearly , the sources of the newtonian _ forces _ are the singularities of the corresponding fields defined on the flat 3-continuum .",
    "although unsatisfactory , this nature of the newtonian framework causes no problems of mathematical nature since this distinction is maintainable within the formalism , _ ie _ , well - defined mathematical procedures for handling this distinction are possible .    here",
    ", one could imagine bodies of vanishing inertia moving with the _ same speed _ relative to all the inertial observers .",
    "but , acceleration ( relative to absolute space ) in newton s second law of motion has no meaning for vanishing inertia .",
    "this inability is a certain indication of the limitations of newton s theoretical framework .",
    "then , if a zero rest - mass object were to exist in reality , and nothing in newton s theory prevents this , it is clear that we need to `` extend '' various newtonian conceptions .",
    "only experiments can tell us about the existence of such bodies .    now , light displays phenomena such as diffraction , interference , polarization etc .",
    "but , as is well known , newton s corpuscular theory needs _ unnatural , non - universal _ , inter - particle forces to explain these phenomena .",
    "that light displays phenomena needing _ unnatural _ explanations in newton s theory could , with hindsight , then be interpreted @xcite to mean that light needs to be treated as a zero rest - mass particle .",
    "then , the speed of light is the _ same _ for all the inertial observers .",
    "revisions of newtonian concepts were necessary by the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "firstly , efforts to reconcile some experimental results with newtonian concepts failed and associated as well as independent conceptions led einstein to special theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "secondly , other experiments related to the wave - particle duality , of radiation and matter , both , ultimately led to non - relativistic quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the methods of non - relativistic quantum field theory @xcite are also similar of nature to the above newtonian methods in that these consider _ quantum fields _",
    "definable on the metrically flat 3-continuum . for these fields of quantum character",
    ", we are of course required to modify the newtonian mathematical methods .",
    "the schrdinger - heisenberg formalism achieves precisely this .",
    "quantum considerations only change the nature of the mathematical ( field ) structure definable on the underlying metrically flat 3-continuum .",
    "that is , differences in the newtonian and the quantum fields are mathematically entirely describable as such .",
    "but , the metrically flat 3-continuum is also , in the above sense , an absolute space in these non - relativistic quantum considerations .",
    "now , importantly , the `` newtonian source properties '' of physical matter are differently treated in the non - relativistic quantum field theory than in newton s theory .",
    "the mass and the electric charge of a physical body appear as pure numbers , _ to be prescribed by hand _ for a point of the metrically flat 3-continuum , in schrdinger s equation or , equivalently , in heisenberg s operators .",
    "quantum theory then provides the probability of the _ location _ of the mass and the charge values in certain specific region of the underlying metrically flat 3-continuum .",
    "the mathematical formalism of the quantum theory provides only probability and it is basically a set of mathematical rules to calculate the probability of a physical event .    however , certain physical variables of the newtonian mass - point acquire _ discrete values _ in the mathematical formalism of the quantum theory .",
    "this discreteness of certain variables is the genuine characteristic of the quantum theory and is a significant departure from their continuous values in newton s theory .",
    "this quantum theory is fundamentally a theory that divides the physical world into two parts , a part that is a system being observed and a part that does the observation .",
    "therefore , quantum theory always refers to an _ observer _ who is _ external _ to the system under observation .",
    "the results of the observation , of course , depend in detail on just how this division is made .",
    "but , it must be recognized that classical concepts are not completely expelled from the physical considerations in the quantum theory . on the contrary , in bohr s words",
    "@xcite :    @xmath2 _ ... it is decisive to recognize that , however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation , the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms_. @xmath2    this applies in spite of the fact that classical ( newtonian ) mechanics does not account for the observations of the microphysical world .",
    "( bohr offered `` complementarity of ( classical ) concepts '' as an explanation for this . )",
    "we also note that it is not possible to treat zero rest mass particles in the non - relativistic quantum theory .",
    "as is well known @xcite , schrdinger s equation or heisenberg s operators of this theory are meaningful only when mass of the considered particle is non - vanishing . essentially , it is the same limitation as that of newton s theory .",
    "non - relativistic quantum field theory can not then describe the phenomena displayed by light .",
    "but , in these non - relativistic quantum considerations , a physical body is described as a non - singular point - particle , not as an extended object .",
    "that is , mass and electric charge appearing herein are non - singularly defined only for a point of the metrically always - flat 3-continuum .",
    "now , special relativity @xcite implies that the _ particle _ of electromagnetic radiation has zero rest - mass - follows from the mass - variation with velocity . special relativity _ enlarges _ the _ galilean group _ of transformations of the metrically flat 3-continuum and time to the _ lorentz group _ of transformations of the metrically flat 3-continuum and time , also treatable as a _ metrically flat 4-dimensional minkowski - continuum_.    lorentz transformations keep minkowski metric the same .",
    "then , special relativistic laws for electromagnetic fields ( mathematical structures on the metrically flat 4-continuum ) , maxwell s equations , are mathematical statements form - invariant under lorentz transformations .    then , `` special relativistic laws of motion '' exist for the sources and maxwell s equations exist for the fields .",
    "so long as we treat the sources and the fields separately , mathematical problems do not arise since well - defined mathematical procedures exist to handle these concepts .",
    "standard mathematical methods then permit us again considerations of classical fields on the minkowski - continuum @xcite .",
    "the `` newtonian '' mathematical methods hold also for them , now in 4-dimensions , and are consistent with the fact that the flat 4-continuum admits the same metric structure before and after the lorentz transformations of these fields .",
    "this is , now , the sense of any theory being classical .",
    "the minkowski - spacetime is then an _",
    "absolute 4-space_.    to describe motions of zero rest mass particles , we ascribe vanishing rest mass to a point of the space .",
    "a point of the space then has @xmath3 when @xmath4 and such a point necessarily moves with the speed of light .",
    "notably , lorentz transformations under which special relativistic laws are form - invariant are _ specific _ coordinate transformations .",
    "further , since the involved transformations are very different than those of newton s theory , concepts of a _ measuring rod _ and a _ clock _ are subject to critical examination and it then becomes clear that the ordinary newtonian these concepts involve the tacit assumption that there exist , in principle , signals that are propagated with an infinite speed .",
    "then , as was shown by einstein @xcite , the absolute character of time is lost completely : initially synchronized clocks at different spatial locations do not keep the same time - value .",
    "however , like with newton s theory , coordinates have a direct physical meaning in special theory of relativity .",
    "although it is the same association of physical character , the lorentz transformations constitute significant departure from the newtonian concepts since time is no longer the absolute time in special relativity .",
    "but , classical considerations of special relativity , like with newton s theory , assume exact measurability as well as strict causality .",
    "now , quantum fields require suitable equations that are form - invariant under lorentz transformations to describe quanta moving close to the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "these quantum fields are , once again , suitable mathematical structures definable on the metrically ever - flat 4-dimensional ( minkowski ) spacetime .",
    "methods of the special relativistic quantum field theory @xcite then handle such _",
    "quantum fields _ defined on the metrically ever - flat 4-continuum admitting a minkowskian metric .",
    "next , the quantum mathematical methods are appropriate generalizations of the mathematical methods of schrdinger - heisenberg formalism .",
    "this , the dirac - schwinger - tomonaga formalism @xcite , achieves for the metrically flat minkowskian 4-continuum that which the schrdinger - heisenberg formalism achieves for the newtonian 3-space and time .",
    "then , the differences in the ( special - relativistic ) classical and quantum fields are mathematically entirely describable as such .",
    "non - relativistic results are recoverable when the velocities are small compared to the speed of light .",
    "however , the underlying minkowski spacetime does not change under the ( lorentz ) transformations keeping the quantum equations form - invariant and is also , in the earlier sense , an _",
    "absolute 4-space _ here .",
    "likewise with non - relativistic theory , a body is represented in these special relativistic quantum considerations by ascribing in _ non - singular _ sense the mass and the charge as pure numbers to points of the ever - flat minkowski 4-continuum in the corresponding operators .",
    "this special relativistic quantum field theory then provides us the probability of the _ spatial location _ and the _ temporal instant _ of the mass and the charge values in a region of the minkowski 4-continuum , for all velocities limited by the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "other massless particles , _ eg _ , neutrinos , are also allowed in the special relativistic quantum field theory due to the group enlargement from that of the galilean group to the lorentz group of transformations .",
    "this group enlargement permits form - invariant dirac equation @xcite and also the theory of massive spin @xmath5 fermions .",
    "but , there is no possibility of explaining the origin of `` mass '' as well as of `` charge '' in , quantum or not , special relativistic theories .",
    "it is only after we have _ specified _ the values of mass and charge for a source particle that we can _ obtain _ , from the mathematical formalisms of these theories , its further dynamics based on the given ( appropriate ) initial data .",
    "hence , the values of mass and charge are not _ obtainable _ in these theories .    clearly , the newtonian and the special relativistic frameworks , both , are not sufficiently general to form the basis for the entire physics . therefore , some new developments are needed to account for the `` origins '' of inertia and electric charge .",
    "we recall here that these are the physical properties by which we `` identify '' or ",
    "characterize individual material or physical bodies .",
    "next , lorentz had recognized @xcite ( p. 155 ) the notion of the _ inertia of the electromagnetic field_. he then had a clear conception that inertia ( opposition of a physical body to a change in its state of motion ) could possess _ origin _ in the field conception . just as a person in a moving crowd experiences opposition to a change in motion , a particle ( region of concentrated field ) moving in a surrounding field experiences opposition to a change in its state of motion .",
    "this is lorentz s conception of the field - origin of inertia .",
    "now , firstly , the distinction between the source and the field must necessarily be obliterated in any formulation of this conception .",
    "in other words , a field is the only basic concept and a particle is a derived concept here .",
    "secondly , the mathematical formulation of this conception is also required to be _ intrinsically nonlinear_.    solutions of linear equations obey superposition principle , and required number of solutions can be superposed to obtain the solution for any assumed field configuration .",
    "but , sources generating the assumed field configuration continue to be the singularities of the field .",
    "hence , the distinction between source and field can not be obliterated .",
    "solutions of some ( non - linear ) field equations would not obey the superposition principle .",
    "then , one could hope that non - singular solutions of non - linear equations for the field would permit appropriate treatment of sources as singularity - free regions of concentrated field energy .",
    "an important question is now that of the appropriate ( non - linear ) field equations , of obtaining these equations without venturing into meaningless arbitrariness .",
    "in fact , this question is of some appropriate non - linear mathematical formalism that need not even possess the character of non - linear ( partial ) differential equations for the field as a mathematical structure on the underlying continuum .",
    "( it is also the issue of whether the most fundamental formalism of physics could have a mathematical structure other than that of the ( partial ) differential equations . )    historically , the very difficult and lengthy path to appropriate non - linear equations was developed by einstein alone .",
    "the pivotal point of einstein s formulation of the relevant ideas is the equivalence of _ inertial _ and _ gravitational _ mass of a physical body , a fact known since newton s times but which remained only an assumption of newton s theory .",
    "the above _ equivalence principle _ implies that the lorentz transformations are not sufficient to incorporate the explanation of this equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass of a material body .",
    "it then follows that general transformations of coordinates are required and the physical basis is that of the _ general principle of relativity_.    on the basis of the _ equivalence principle _ , einstein then provided us the `` curved 4-geometry '' as a `` physically realizable '' entity .",
    "to arrive at his formulation of general relativity , einstein raised @xcite ( p. 69 ) the following questions :    @xmath2 _ of which mathematical type are the variables ( functions of the coordinates ) which permit the expression of the physical properties of the space ( `` structure '' ) ?",
    "only after that : which equations are satisfied by those variables ? _",
    "@xmath2    he then proceeded to develop this theory in two stages , namely , those dealing with    \\(a ) pure gravitational field , and    \\(b ) general field ( in which quantities corresponding somehow to the electromagnetic field occur , too ) .",
    "the situation ( a ) , the pure gravitational field , is characterized by a symmetric ( riemannian ) metric ( tensor of rank two ) for which the riemann curvature tensor does not vanish .    for the case",
    "( b ) , einstein @xcite ( p. 73 ) then set up the `` preliminary equations '' to investigate _ the right side _",
    "( the matter part ) _ is a formal condensation of all things whose comprehension in the sense of a field theory is still problematic . not for a moment , of course , did i doubt that this formulation was merely a makeshift in order to give the general principle of relativity a preliminary closed expression . for it was essentially not anything _ more _ than a theory of the gravitational field , which was somewhat artificially isolated from a total field of as yet unknown structure_. @xmath2 ] the usefulness of the basic ideas of general relativity .",
    "his ( makeshift ) field equations of this formulation of general relativity are form - invariant under general ( spacetime ) coordinate transformations .",
    "the form - invariance of field equations under general coordinate transformations is known as the principle of general covariance @xcite .",
    "`` so there is nothing for it but to regard all imaginable systems of coordinates , on principle , as equally suitable for the description of nature .",
    "this comes to requiring that : - + _ the general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold good for all systems of coordinates , that is , are covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever ( generally covariant)_. + it is clear that a physical theory which satisfies this postulate will also be suitable for the general postulate of relativity . ''",
    "@xmath2 + notice the word `` suitable '' above .",
    "the strength of the requirement of covariance depends upon the _ a priori _ selection of geometrical quantities and can be relaxed by adding more geometrical quantities to the theory .",
    "it is therefore based on the principle of simplicity , rather than being any fundamental demand of the general principle of relativity .",
    "de witt in @xcite ( 1967 , vol .",
    "160 ) remarks `` general relativity is concerned with those attributes of physical reality which are coordinate - independent and is the rock on which present day emphasis on invariance principles will ultimately stand or fall . '' ]    through these equations , geometric properties of the spacetime are supposed to be determined by the physical matter . in turn , the spacetime geometry is supposed to tell the physical matter how to move .",
    "that is , the geodesics of the spacetime geometry are supposed to provide the law of motion of the physical matter .    the ideas of general relativity essentially free physics from the association of physical meaning to coordinates and coordinate differences , an assumption implicit in newton s theory and in special relativity .",
    "the formulation of einstein s ( makeshift ) field equations however attaches physical meaning to the invariant distance of the curved spacetime geometry and considers it to be a physically exactly measurable quantity .",
    "now , we may imagine @xcite a _ small _ perturbation of the _ background _ spacetime geometry and obtain equations governing these perturbations",
    ". we may also consider @xcite quantum fields on the _ unchanging background _",
    ".    then , such methods ( of perturbative analysis and also of the quantum field theory in curved spacetime ) are quite similar of nature to methods adopted for either the flat 3-continuum or the flat 4-continuum in that these consider `` mathematical fields '' definable on the fixed and metrically curved , absolute , 4-continuum .    but , as far as lorentz s or einstein s ideas are concerned , these above considerations of quantum field theory in curved spacetime or perturbations of a curved spacetime geometry are , evidently , _ not _ self - consistent since matter fields must affect the background spacetime geometry .",
    "however , these are _ not _ the real issues here .",
    "importantly , einstein s approach to his field equations is beset with internal contradictions of serious physical nature @xcite .",
    "these contradictions originate in the fact that gravity is given preferential treatment in it .",
    "( see later . )",
    "firstly , einstein s vacuum field equations `` einstein never said so explicitly , but it seems reasonable to assume that he had in mind that the correct equations should have no solutions at all in the absence of matter . ''",
    "@xmath2 ] are entirely unsatisfactory @xcite since these are field equations for the pure gravitational field _ without _ even a possibility of the equations of motion for the sources of that field .",
    "certainly , matter can not be any part of the theory of the vacuum or the pure gravitational field .",
    "then , there can not be physical objects in considerations of the pure gravitational field , except as sources of such fields .",
    "now , a material particle is necessarily a spacetime singularity of the pure gravitational field and , hence , mathematically , no equations of motion for it are possible .",
    "then , we have only equations for the pure field but no equations of motion for the sources creating those fields .    but , the vacuum field equations alone are _ not enough _ to draw any conclusions of physical nature . without the laws for the motions of sources generating the ( vacuum ) fields",
    ", we have no means of ascertaining or establishing the `` causes '' of motions of sources .",
    "no conclusions of physical nature are therefore permissible in this situation and , thus , the vacuum field equations can not lead us to physically verifiable predictions .",
    "[ note that this above situation is markedly different from that with special relativity .",
    "in special relativity , the background geometry does not possess any _ geometric singularity _ at any location , but only the ( mathematical ) fields defined on this geometry can be singular . then , similar to newton s theory , situations in special relativity lead us to physically testable predictions . ]    secondly , recall that the energy - momentum tensor deals with the density and fluxes of particles . then , unless a definition of what constitutes a particle is , a - priori , available to us , we can not construct the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "now , various relevant solutions of einstein s field equations represent a point particle as a spacetime singularity for which no laws of motion are possible .",
    "consequently , no acceptable description of a particle is available in einstein s approach to the general theory of relativity .",
    "therefore , the concept of a particle is _ not _ clearly defined to begin with and , hence , is _ not _ a - priori available in einstein s approach to his ( makeshift ) field equations .",
    "thus , einstein s preliminary field equations are ill - posed @xcite .",
    "notably , this above does not , however , invalidate or question the general principle of relativity in any manner whatsoever .",
    "( see later . )",
    "next , recall that the quantum theory based on schrdinger s @xmath7-function provides us , essentially , the means of calculating the probability of a physical event .",
    "it presupposes that we have specified , say , the lagrangian or , equivalently , certain physical characteristics of the problem under consideration .",
    "evidently , this is necessary to determine the @xmath7-function using which we then make ( probabilistic ) predictions regarding that physical phenomenon under consideration .    at this stage",
    ", we then note the following fundamental limitation of any theory that uses probabilistic considerations .",
    "( this limitation is clearly recognizable for statistical mechanics in relation to the newtonian theory . )",
    "importantly , the method of obtaining the probability of the outcome of its toss is _ irrelevant _ to _ intrinsic _ properties of the coin .",
    "therefore , methods of quantum theory , these leading us to the probability of the outcome of a physical experiment about a chosen physical object , can not provide us the means of `` specifying '' certain intrinsic properties of that physical body .",
    "this fact , precisely , appears to be the reason as to why we had to _",
    "specify by hand _",
    "the values of the mass and the charge in various operators of the non - relativistic as well as relativistic versions of the quantum theory .    therefore , quantum theory _ presupposes _ that we have _ specified _ intrinsic properties of physical object(s ) under consideration .",
    "hence , origins of such properties are to be sought `` elsewhere '' and not within the quantum theory .    hence , we have that the formulation of general relativity as only a theory of gravitation , einstein s 1916 ( makeshift ) field equations @xcite , is entirely unsatisfactory .",
    "we also have that the probabilistic quantum theory can not hope to explain the origins of inertia and electric charge .",
    "but , even when einstein s field equations are physically ill - posed , the underlying conceptions of the geometry being indistinguishable from the physical matter need not be so . _",
    "the general principle of relativity makes sense even without einstein s equations_. ( see later . ) proper recognition of this issue is then important .",
    "a question therefore arises of some satisfactory mathematical formulation of not only the fundamental conceptions underlying the general principle of relativity but also of unifying them with the fundamental conceptions of the quantum theory in an appropriate manner .",
    "but , for the `` new '' theory , we need the conceptual framework of only the general principle of relativity or only that of the probabilistic quantum theory , and not the both .",
    "let us then turn to the issues related to this choice .",
    "now , the two `` most successful '' theories of the 20th century , namely , the quantum theory and einstein s theory of gravity , possess profoundly different conceptual frameworks and have led us to adopt `` separate '' approaches to various problems of the micro and the macro world .",
    "as far as the theories of the micro - world are concerned , these are based on the principles of the quantum theory .",
    "qed , qcd etc .  have been experimentally justified by way of the verification of their predictions , some to remarkable accuracies .",
    "these successes @xcite lead us to accept the conceptual basis of the quantum theory .",
    "but , these theories of the micro physical world are certainly _ incomplete _ without the incorporation of gravitation of the micro - objects .",
    "now , the general principle of relativity has the appropriate conceptual framework for gravitation .",
    "einstein s equivalence principle provides us the appropriate basis to formulate a theory of gravitation .",
    "einstein , in 1916 , had followed exactly this path to propose his preliminary equations for the field theory of gravitation .",
    "einstein s formulation of general relativity as _ only _ a theory of gravitation leads us to classic tests of this theory of gravity such as the precession of the perihelion of mercury , the bending of light , the gravitational red - shift etc .    these classic tests of general relativity , though not as accurate as those of the theories of the micro world ,",
    "provide us adequate reasons to also accept , simultaneously , the conceptual framework of the general principle of relativity .    as an early recognition of the diverse conceptual frameworks of these two aforementioned physical theories and also as an early warning about the involved issues",
    ", einstein wrote in 1916 ( preussische akademie sitzungsberichte ) that :    @xmath2 _ nevertheless , due to the interatomic movement of electrons , atoms would have to radiate not only electromagnetic but also gravitational energy , if only in tiny amounts .",
    "as this is hardly true in nature , it appears that quantum theory would have to modify not only maxwellian electrodynamics but also the new theory of gravitation .",
    "_ @xmath2    surely , einstein s formulation deals only with the phenomenon of gravitation and , consequently , does not incorporate electromagnetism as well as other aspects of various known micro - particles on the same footing as gravity .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to expect that aspects related to quantum nature of ( gravitating ) matter would necessitate fundamental changes to , the then new , einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "equally surely , an appropriate synthesis of the quantum theory and the general principle of relativity is also necessary as their diverse conceptual frameworks force on us a `` schizophrenic '' view @xcite of the physical world in which we treat macro world as per einstein s theory of gravity and the micro world as per the quantum theory .",
    "a question then arises of the `` final correctness '' of the conceptual basis .",
    "einstein , as is well known @xcite , chose the general principle of relativity while most like bohr , heisenberg , dirac , pauli chose the probabilistic quantum theory .",
    "einstein s attempts at the unified field theory led him and others , like schrdinger , de broglie @xcite , to nowhere .",
    "but , einstein sang his `` solitary song '' in favor of the conceptual basis of general relativity till the end @xcite .",
    "learning , perhaps , from the failures of einstein s numerous attempts at the formulation of a satisfactory unified field theory and keeping thereby `` faith '' in probabilistic methods of the quantum theory , some like bronstein , rosenfeld , pauli , then attempted to _",
    "einstein s gravity in the same manner as was followed for other fields such as the electromagnetic field .",
    "but , such an approach to the `` quantum theory of gravity '' was slated to face serious mathematical difficulties .",
    "the foremost of these difficulties is that the metric of the spacetime geometry is not just an inert arena but also the primary dynamical quantity in einstein s theory of gravity which has _ no _ background metric",
    ".    the known procedures of quantum theory were geared to the existence of a background metric such as the minkowski metric .",
    "therefore , by giving up einstein s most cherished dream , inseparability of geometry and matter , the 4-metric was treated as a perturbative tensor field over the ( usually ) flat background .",
    "this gave us the covariant formalism of quantum gravity .",
    "for this formalism , feynman then extended perturbative methods of qed to einstein s gravity .",
    "then , de witt formulated @xcite the feynman rules for covariantly quantized einstein s gravity .",
    "this all then led us to the notion of a massless spin-@xmath8 graviton .",
    "but , this perturbative quantum gravity turned out to be non - renormalizable .",
    "the non - renormalizable nature of perturbative quantization of einstein s gravity was interpreted to mean that important high energy processes ( at the planck energy scale ) were being ignored by these perturbative methods .",
    "a cure for this problem was sought by coupling einstein s gravity to other fields , as it must be . in particular , `` super - gravity '' imagined cancellation of bosonic infinities of the gravity by those of the suitable fermionic fields @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that super - gravity will be non - renormalizable at the fifth and at higher order loops . in the mean while , an innovative idea of replacing point particles by a 1-dimensional ( nambu - goto ) string , an extended object , was invoked for the theory of strong interactions .    originally ,",
    "the `` duality hypothesis '' that the @xmath9- and @xmath10-channel diagrams provide `` dual '' descriptions of the same physics , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mandelstam variables , was tried @xcite for the strong interactions .",
    "however , models based on the above duality hypothesis predicted a variety of massless particles which do not exist in the hadron world .",
    "then , this failure of the duality theories eventually yielded the way for qcd .",
    "but , duality theories could accommodate high spin particles without ultraviolet anomalies and , in `` quantized '' general relativity , the gravitational field is to be a massless spin-2 graviton .",
    "hence , the idea that some `` duality theory '' could be a `` theory of _ all _ interactions '' soon caught attention .",
    "then , the veneziano duality model was also shown to be a relativistic string .    in the string theory approach ,",
    "different modes of oscillations of the string correspond to particle - like states .",
    "then , it turns out that , in addition to the spin-1 mode , there also exists in string theory a spin-2 mode . a boon in disguise , the spin-2 mode could then represent gravity .    within the theoretical framework of the string theory , only one fundamental quantity , the string tension , needs to be specified a - priori .",
    "then , it is tempting indeed to think that a built - in unification of all interactions by way of the modes of vibrations of the string is possible .",
    "this expectation led to a flurry of theoretical activity .",
    "as many implications of string theory were being developed , usefulness of its ideas was also explored in the context of cosmological conceptions .",
    "such studies explored mainly the `` cosmological '' implications of higher dimensions necessarily required for the string theory .",
    "the string theory @xcite necessarily uses dimensions higher than the usual four ( 10 for the super - string and 26 for the bosonic string for which quantum anomalies do not occur in the theory ) .",
    "it also uses the ideas of super - symmetry and works with background fields as essential ingredients .",
    "the overall thrust of the string theory is then certainly on the unification of all the four interactions , including einstein s gravity by way of the spin-2 mode of the string oscillations .",
    "still , it needs to be adequately realized that the string theory _ can not _ hope to explain the origins of either the inertia or the electrostatic charge on the basis of only the string tension which is an arbitrary constant of this theory .",
    "but , a `` theory of everything '' must provide these aforementioned explanations . if not anything else , this aforementioned inability of the string theory alone forces us to look `` elsewhere '' for the explanations of properties of matter .",
    "next , another approach to quantum theory of gravity also evolved simultaneously to the string theory .",
    "it was shown by dirac @xcite that the hamiltonian of einstein s theory of gravity is a mathematically well - defined quantity .",
    "motions generated by this hamiltonian are then evolutions in time of the initial spatial section , the cauchy surface of the einstein field equations .",
    "these theoretical developments led to the canonical approach to einstein s gravity which is then to be viewed as the dynamical theory of the 3-geometries - the geometrodynamics .",
    "the adm - formalism then led to further developments in canonical approach .",
    "the 3-metric and the extrinsic curvature of the 3-geometry are the canonically conjugate variables of the geometrodynamics .",
    "notably , einstein s field equations for gravity then reduce to two types of equations : constraints and evolution equations .",
    "one could then think of using ( generalizations of ) dirac s methods for quantization of `` constrained systems '' for these sets of equations of gravity .",
    "these developments led to a definite ( wheeler s ) program of ambitious nature to quantize einstein s gravity .",
    "however , this proposal remained mostly formal and quite separate from quantum theories of the micro world .    in this last context",
    ", deserving special mention are the recent developments related to quantum geometry @xcite .",
    "notably , the ashtekar phase space of einstein s gravity is the same as that of the gauge theories of the micro world .",
    "the basis of these developments is a canonical transformation of the adm variables of gravity that yields , at the most , polynomial constraints .",
    "`` spin connection '' and `` triad '' achieve together this simplification .",
    "the 3-metric , obtainable from ashtekar s spinorial variables , is nowhere needed in the `` metric - free '' formalism .",
    "canonical gravity being non - perturbative , these achievements were quite important for quantum gravity .",
    "the quantization of the einstein - ashtekar gravity leads to `` loop - states , ''",
    "1-dimensional excitations , from which the continuum arises only as a coarse - grained approximation over the `` weave '' states of quantum geometry .",
    "this `` quantized '' einstein - ashtekar gravity , the theory of the quantum geometry , then appears to be the `` ultimate '' logical end of the program of canonical gravity .",
    "but , it has not provided yet any principle or procedure for incorporating other three interactions .",
    "however , this formalism of quantum geometry is basically a rigorous mathematical theory , like the euclidean geometry , in which one needs to `` insert by hand '' physical qualifications of matter to connect it to the physical world .    in the context of this above issue",
    ", one is then bound to recall einstein s theorem @xcite ( p.63 ) that :    @xmath2 _ ... nature is so constituted that it is possible logically to lay down such strongly determined laws that within these laws only rationally completely determined constants occur ( not constants , therefore , whose numerical values could be changed without destroying the theory ) . --- _",
    "@xmath2    then , an additional `` physical difficulty '' of the quantum theory of geometry is that physical constants ( such as planck s constant , newton s constant of gravitation etc . )",
    "also do not arise in it from various permissible mutual relationships of physical bodies , just exactly as we obtain them experimentally out of mutual relationships of the involved physical objects .",
    "but , physical constants have to be specified by hand not only in quantum geometry but also in string theory .",
    "consequently , these theories are , physically speaking , quite limited .. the same limitations apply to other highly original and motivating approaches such as the euclidean quantum gravity @xcite , twistor theory @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite , the theory of h - spaces @xcite etc . , although these approaches are not discussed here for want of space and purpose .",
    "now , as seen earlier , einstein s formulation of his field equations is itself beset with problems of serious physical concerns .",
    "moreover , as also seen earlier , methods of quantum theory , leading us to the calculation of only the probability of a physical event , can not provide us the `` origins '' of intrinsic properties of physical objects .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to `` look '' beyond the mathematical formalism of either of these theories to reach to some appropriate , theoretically satisfactory , explanations of the origins of the properties of physical matter .",
    "now , as will be discussed in the next sections , the general principle of relativity still holds .",
    "it therefore seems advisable to follow the conservative path of developing appropriate mathematical formulation based on the general principle of relativity and basic conceptions of the quantum theory , and to let it suggest to us the explanations of physical phenomena .",
    "hence , even at the cost of being elementary and pedantic , it appears to be certainly worthwhile to recall here as to what the `` phenomenon of gravitation '' is all about and how exactly newton s and einstein s theories attempt to explain it .      to begin with ,",
    "let us note that the foremost of the concepts behind newton s theory is , undoubtedly , ( galileo s ) concept of the inertia of a material body .",
    "we postulate that every material body has this inertia for motion .",
    "the association of the inertia of a material body with the points of the euclidean space is the first primary physical conception that is necessary for newton s theory to describe motions of physical bodies .",
    "then , with this association , the euclidean distance becomes the _ physical distance _ separating material bodies and the euclidean space becomes the _ physical space _ for any further considerations of newton s theoretical scheme .",
    "next , a _ physical clock _ is a material body undergoing periodic motion or a periodic phenomenon .",
    "essentially , in newton s theory , a physical clock is a set of points of the euclidean space exhibiting periodic motion under a _ periodic _ transformation .",
    "mathematically , in newton s theory , let @xmath11 be the set of all points @xmath12 of the euclidean space making up the clock .",
    "let @xmath13 be the _ periodic _ transformation such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the period of the transformation @xmath13 .",
    "in newton s theory , an observer can _ observe _ the _ entire periodic motion _ of the material body of the clock ( under the use of the transformation @xmath13 ) without disturbing the clock in any manner whatsoever .",
    "then , the _ known _ state or the reading of the clock",
    "_ represents _ the _ physical time_. any `` measurement '' of the physical time gives the period or the part of the period @xmath15 of the transformation @xmath13 .",
    "it is tacitly assumed in these considerations that the involved quantities are _ exactly _ measurable .    now , consider a material point with an initial location @xmath16 . in newton",
    "s theory , the trajectory of this material point is a ( continuous ) sequence of points of the euclidean space .",
    "it is then a `` curve '' traced by the point @xmath16 under some transformation @xmath17 of the euclidean space where parameter @xmath10 labels points of the sequence .",
    "of course , the transformation @xmath17 need not be periodic .",
    "the label parameter @xmath10 can then be made to correspond to the physical time in a one - one correspondence .",
    "this is theoretically permissible as the measurement of the physical time does not disturb the clock in any manner whatsoever in newton s theory .",
    "this correspondence is the physical meaning of the labelling parameter @xmath10 .",
    "an observer can thus check the position of another material point against the state of a _ physical clock_. without this `` correspondence , '' the geometric curve of the euclidean space has no physical sense for the path of a material point .",
    "when such physical associations are carried out , we say that the material point is at `` this '' location given by the three space coordinates and the physical clock is _ simultaneously _ showing `` this '' time .",
    "simultaneity _ is inherent in the physical associations of newton s theory .",
    "also , as a consequence of the fact that newton s theory treats material bodies as _ existing _ independently of the space , the state of a physical clock or its reading is _ assumed _ to be independent of the motion of another material point or points separately under considerations .",
    "then , physical time is _ independent _ also of the coordination of the metrically - flat euclidean space .",
    "but , then , the motion of a material point in the `` physical '' space does not produce any change in that space .",
    "clearly , this fact applies also to the periodic motion or the periodic phenomenon making up the physical clock .",
    "the `` physical '' construction of the coordinate axes and clocks must also be using the material bodies , for example , coordinate axes could be constructed using `` sufficiently long '' material rods , say , of wood . then , any material object , a road - roller , say , crossing the coordinate axis must `` affect '' the corresponding wooden rod .",
    "but , in newton s theory , the coordinate axes of the euclidean space do not get affected by the motions of other material bodies . clearly , use of non - cartesian coordinates does not change this state of affairs with newton s theory .",
    "now , any difference of coordinates in the euclidean space is a `` measuring stick or rod '' that can be used to `` measure '' the physical separation of material bodies .",
    "furthermore , in newton s theory , each observer has a coordinate system of such measuring rods and clocks .",
    "then , when one observer is in motion ( relative to another one ) , the _ entire _ system of coordinate axes and clocks is also carried with that observer in motion .",
    "conceptually , the aforementioned physical situation is `` acceptable '' except in one case .",
    "surely , we can not have a material rod with one observer and _ simultaneously _ , another material rod , _ at the same place _",
    ", with other observer in ( uniform or not ) motion relative to the first one .",
    "but , in newton s theory , measuring stick of one observer does not collide with that of another observer in motion even when both these sticks arrive at the same place .",
    "unacceptably , any two such measuring sticks just pass through each other without even colliding on their first contact .",
    "the same situation does not arise for other material bodies which are supposed to collide on their first contact .",
    "then , in newton s theory , the measuring rods of the physical space - euclidean space - are treated _ separately _ than other material objects .",
    "but , measuring rods must also be made up of material objects",
    ". then , their separate treatment is , theoretically , not appropriate one . surely , this problem with newton s theory is , undeniably , of serious theoretical concern .",
    "( this above issue would not have been relevant if the euclidean distance were also not , simultaneously , the physical distance separating material bodies .",
    "mathematically , the continuum @xmath18 can be assumed . )    hence , newton s theory attempts to _ explain all phenomena as relations between objects existing in euclidean space and time_. it achieves this by attributing _",
    "absolute _ properties to the space and the time , thereby totally separating them from the properties and motions of matter .",
    "thus , limitations of newton s theoretical scheme ( providing his famous three laws of motion ) originate in its use of the cartesian concepts related to the euclidean space and the associations of properties of material bodies with the points of this metrically - flat space .",
    "now , the entire physical structure of newton s theory is woven around only two basic concepts , namely , those of the inertia and the force .",
    "clearly , the force , as a cause of motion , is another pivotal concept of newton s theory .",
    "hence , consider the status of the concept of force , the cause behind motions of material bodies , within newton s theory of mechanics .",
    "firstly , we could ask : what is the _ cause _ of this force ? within newton s overall theoretical scheme , only a material point can be the source of force . a material point `` here '' _ acts _ on a material point located `` there '' with the specified force .",
    "newton s theoretical scheme is therefore an _ action at a distance _ framework .",
    "then , in newton s theory , we can consider a physical body as one material point and also other physical bodies as other material points . we vectorially add the forces exerted by each one on the first physical body to obtain the total force acting on it .",
    "it is this _ total force _ that is used by newton s second law of motion to provide the means of establishing the path followed by that physical body under the action of that total force .    in newton s second law of motion , we _ must _ first _ specify _ the _ force _ acting on a material body .",
    "only then can we solve the corresponding differential equation(s ) and obtain , subject to the given initial data , the path of the material point representing that material body .",
    "then , without the _ law of force _ , it is clear that the _ law of motion _ is _ empty _ of contents in newton s theoretical framework .",
    "this is an extremely important issue for a physical theory .    from our ordinary , day - to - day , observations",
    ", we notice that various objects fall to the earth when left `` free '' in the air .",
    "we then say that objects _ gravitate _ towards the earth .",
    "this is , in a nutshell , the _ phenomenon of gravitation_.    we then need to explain as to why the objects `` ordinarily '' gravitate to earth , _ ie _ , why they have a tendency to come together or why the distance between them decreases with time .    in newton s theory , only _",
    "forces _ `` cause '' motions of material bodies . then , the gravitating behavior of objects is `` explainable '' only by _ postulating _ a suitable _ force of gravity _ that makes material bodies fall to the earth .",
    "but , in newton s theory , a force acts between _ any two _ separate material points possessing the _ required source property _ by virtue of which the force in question is generated .",
    "furthermore , for the internal consistency of newton s scheme , the force so generated by one material point on the second material point must also be equal in amplitude but opposite in direction to that generated by the second material point on the first material point .",
    "this is newton s third law of motion .",
    "this law also has the status of a postulate within the overall scheme of the newtonian mechanics .",
    "newton had _ assumed _ that the force of gravity is proportional to the _ inertias _ of the two material points under consideration because , following galileo , he had postulated that inertia `` characterizes '' a physical body .",
    "such a force of gravity must then be generated by a chosen body ( earth ) on _ all _ the other material bodies because , by postulate , every material body possessed inertia .",
    "the force of gravity must then be _ universal _ in character .",
    "to explain many of the day - to - day observations involving the terrestrial bodies as well as planetary motions that were already known in details , newton was therefore compelled to state a law of force - newton s law of gravity - to explain the phenomenon of gravitation .",
    "in fact , in newton s theory , a material body has two _ independent _ attributes : the first , its _ inertial mass _ , is a measure of the opposition it offers to a change in its state of motion , and the second , its _ gravitational mass _ , is a measure of the property by virtue of which it produces the force of gravity on another material point .",
    "various observations , since galileo s times , then indicate @xcite that the inertial and the gravitational masses of a material body are equal to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "however , this equality becomes an assumption of newton s theory .",
    "inverse - square dependence of the gravitational force on the distance separating two bodies is also an assumption of newton s theory .    in relation to the inverse - square dependence of newton s force of gravity on distance separating two bodies",
    ", we could then always raise questions : why not any other power of distance ?",
    "why should this force not contain time - derivatives of the space coordinates ?",
    "clearly , newton s theory offers no explanation for even the inverse - square dependence of the force of gravitation .",
    "hence , in newton s scheme , his law of gravitation has the status of a _ postulate _ about the _ force _ acting between two material particles separated by some spatial distance .",
    "also , coulomb s law from the electrostatics provides another , postulated , fundamental force .",
    "it is also assumed to exist _ universally _ between any two _ charged _ material bodies .",
    "it is an `` additional '' force , over and above that of gravity , which newton s theory postulates to explain the motions of charged material points .",
    "now , every object does not fall to the earth .",
    "so , `` something '' opposes the attractive force of gravity . that `` something '' must also be another force",
    "thus , in a nutshell , a force can oppose another .",
    "but , _ every _ force is an assumption here .",
    "then , if we find that some physical body , for example , a star , is stable , we could , in newton s theory , explain its stability by postulating another suitable _ force _ which counterchecks the force of self - gravity of the star . on the other hand , if the star were unstable , existence of `` unbalanced '' forces in the star is implied .    in newton s theory , there are no fundamentally important issues involved here than those related to finding the nature of the force opposing the self - gravity of the star .",
    "it is essential to recognize this important aspect of newton s theory .",
    "nonetheless , in spite of it being an assumption of newton s theory , newton s inverse - square law of gravitation does possess certain experimental justification - it is this inverse - square dependence that is known to be consistent with various observations and experiments .",
    "still , it can not be denied that newton s law of gravitation is an important _ assumption _ of the newtonian mechanics .    to reemphasize the status of the laws of the force in newton s theory , we note that every force is an assumption of this theory . some forces are assumed to exist _ universally _ between any two material bodies . in particular , `` the force of gravitation '' is postulated by this theory .    in newton",
    "s theory , every `` fundamental '' notion of the force necessarily requires a source property to be attributed to material bodies .",
    "then , the action - at - a - distance force has this important characteristic always .",
    "obviously , newton s theory can not hope to `` explain '' the origin of any of such source attributes , each of these source attributes being an assumption of that theory .",
    "evidently , the same applies to other action - at - a - distance theories .",
    "it is important to recognize this fact at this early stage of our present considerations .",
    "perhaps , we would have been satisfied even with these assumptions of newton s theory if it were not for the fact that newton s theory does not explain the phenomena displayed by light . moreover , various observations related to the wave - particle duality of light as well as matter are also unexplainable within the newtonian scheme .",
    "apart from various fundamental reasons of theoretical nature as discussed earlier , it is also for such experiments or observations which can not be explained by newton s theory , that some suitable `` new '' theory becomes a necessity .    of course",
    ", different results of newton s theory which successfully describe motions of material bodies must be obtainable within the new theory in some suitable way .    then , to formulate `` new '' theory , we need to , not just modify but , abandon some newtonian concepts at a fundamental level .",
    "now , let us also note the newtonian _ principle of relativity _ which states that : _ if a coordinate system @xmath19 is chosen so that newton s laws of motion hold good without the introduction of any pseudo - forces with respect to this frame then , the _ same _ laws also hold good in relation to other coordinate system @xmath20 moving in _ uniform _ translation relatively to @xmath19_. this principle is a direct consequence of the experiments conducted by galileo .    these issues then bring us to the question of the status of the principle of relativity in a theoretical framework that abandons the newtonian concept of the force .",
    "it is to this and other related issues that we now turn to .      to incorporate the physical description of the phenomena displayed by light , zero rest - mass object , einstein modified the newtonian principle of relativity as : _",
    "if a coordinate system @xmath19 is chosen so that physical laws hold good in their simplest form with respect to this frame then , the _ same _ laws also hold good in relation to other coordinate system @xmath20 moving in _ uniform _ translation relatively to @xmath19_. this is the _ special principle of relativity_. as is well known , together with the principle of the constancy of the speed of light in vacuo , it leads to the special theory of relativity .",
    "einstein s this special principle of relativity is essentially the _ same _ as the principle of relativity of newton s theory .",
    "the word `` special '' indicates here that the principle is restricted to the case of uniform translational motion of @xmath20 relative to @xmath19 and does not extend to non - uniform motion of @xmath20 in relation to the system @xmath19 .",
    "but , even the special theory of relativity is not sufficiently general to offer explanations for various physical phenomena as observed . not only gravity , but , as should be amply clear , the origin of inertia as well as the origin of electrostatic charge are also not explainable in special relativity .    primarily , the special theory of relativity is an extension of _ only _ the newtonian laws to accommodate properties of motions of material bodies with vanishing inertia @xcite .",
    "it achieves this extension by acknowledging the fact that , in our day - to - day experiences , we use light to observe .",
    "but , the special theory of relativity also rests on the metrically flat continuum and is , thereby , beset with the problems of treating the measuring rods and clocks separately from all other objects .",
    "there is therefore the need to extend the special principle of relativity .    then , einstein extended @xcite this principle on the basis of mach s reasoning as follows .",
    "mach s reasoning concerns the following situation .",
    "consider two _ identical _ fluid bodies so far from each other and from other material bodies that only the _ self - gravity _ of each one needs to be considered .",
    "let the distance between them be invariable , and in neither of them let there be `` internal motions '' with respect to each other . also , let either body , as judged by an observer at rest relative to the other body , _ rotate _ with constant angular velocity about the line joining them .",
    "this is , importantly , a _",
    "verifiable _ relative motion of the two identical fluid bodies .",
    "now , using surveyor s instruments , let an observer at rest relative to each body make measurements of the surface of that body .",
    "let the revealed surface of one body be _ spherical _ and of the other body be an _ ellipsoid of revolution_.    the question then arises of the _ reason _ behind this difference in these two bodies .",
    "of course , no answer is to be considered satisfactory unless the given reason is _",
    "observable_. this is so because the law of causality has the `` genuine scientific '' significance only when observable effects ultimately appear as causes and effects .",
    "as is well known , newton s theory as well as the special theory of relativity require the introduction of _ fictitious or the pseudo _ forces to provide an answer to this issue .",
    "the reason given by these two theories is , obviously , entirely unsatisfactory since the pseudo - forces are unobservable .",
    "any cause within the system of these two bodies alone will not be sufficient as it would have to refer to the absolute space only .",
    "but , the absolute space is necessarily unobservable and , consequently , any such `` internal '' cause will not be in conformity with the law of causality .",
    "the only satisfactory answer is that the cause must be outside of this physical system , and that must be referred to the _ real difference _ in motions of _ distant _ material bodies relative to each fluid body under consideration .",
    "then , the frame of reference of one fluid body is _ equivalent _ to that of the other body for a description of the `` motions '' of other bodies .",
    "as mach had `` concluded '' @xcite , no observable significance can be attached to the cause of the difference in their shapes without this equivalence .",
    "_ the laws of physics must then be such that they apply to systems of reference in any kind of motion ( without the introduction of any fictitious causes or forces)_. this is then the extended or the _ general principle of relativity_.    _ clearly , the reference frames must be constructed out of material bodies and any motions of `` other '' material bodies must affect the constructions of the reference frames .",
    "therefore , the general principle of relativity also means that the laws of physics must be so general as to incorporate even these situations in their entirety . _    now , equally important is the fact that _ the notion of the _ physical time _ must undergo appropriate changes when the above is implemented_. in particular , the correspondence of the labelling parameter of the `` path '' of a physical body with the time displayed by a physical clock must be different than that in newton s theory or in special relativity .",
    "_ notably , the underlying continuum and the physical space are then different_.    einstein connected the general principle of relativity with the observation that a possible _ uniform _ gravitation imparts the same acceleration to all bodies .",
    "this insight leads us to einstein s equivalence principle .",
    "it arises as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be a galilean frame of reference relative to which a material body is moving with uniform rectilinear motion when far removed from other material bodies .",
    "let @xmath20 be another frame of reference which is moving relatively to @xmath19 in uniformly accelerated translation .",
    "then , relatively to @xmath20 , that same material body would have an acceleration which is independent of its material content as well as of its physical state .    the observer at rest in frame @xmath20 can then raise the question of determining whether frame @xmath20 is `` really '' in an accelerated motion .",
    "that is , whether this is the only cause for the acceleration of bodies being independent of material content .",
    "now , let various bodies , of differing material contents and of differing inertias , fall freely under the action of earth s gravity after being released from the same distance above the ground and at the same instant of time .",
    "galileo had , supposedly at the leaning tower of pisa , observed that these bodies reach the ground at the same instant of time and had thereby concluded that these bodies fall with the _ same _ accelerations .",
    "hence , the _ decrement in distance _ between material bodies displaying only the phenomenon of gravitation is then _ uniquely _ characterized by the fact that the acceleration experienced by material bodies , occupying sufficiently small region of space near another material body of large spatial dimension , is independent of their material content and their physical state . here",
    ", the gravitational action of the larger material body can then be treated as being that of _ uniform _ gravitation .",
    "therefore , the answer to the question raised by the observer at rest in the frame @xmath20 is in the negative since there does exist an analogous situation involving the phenomenon of uniform gravitation in which material bodies can possess acceleration that is independent of their material content and the physical state .",
    "thus , the observer at rest in the frame @xmath20 can alternatively explain the observation of the `` acceleration being independent of the physical state or the material content of bodies '' on the basis of the phenomenon of _ uniform _ gravitation .",
    "the mechanical behavior of involved material bodies relative to the frame @xmath20 is then the same as that in the frame @xmath19 , being considered `` special '' as per the special principle of relativity .",
    "we can therefore say that the two frames @xmath19 and @xmath20 are _ equivalent _ for the description of the facts under consideration .",
    "clearly , we can then extend the special principle of relativity to incorporate even the `` accelerated '' frames .",
    "borrowing einstein s words on this issue @xcite , this above situation is then _ suggestive _ that :    @xmath2 _ the systems @xmath19 and @xmath20 may both with equal right be looked upon as `` stationary , '' that is to say , they have an equal title as systems of reference for the physical description of phenomena_. @xmath2    [ note the word `` suggestive '' in this statement . ]    now , the equality of inertial and gravitational masses of a material body refers to the `` equality '' of corresponding qualities of a material body .",
    "but , this is permissible only in a theory that assumes the concept of a force as an external cause of motions of material bodies .",
    "the concept of the gravitational mass is , however , _",
    "irrelevant _ when the concept of force is abandoned .",
    "only the concept of the inertia of a material body is then relevant to the motions of physical bodies .",
    "what then is the status of the general principle of relativity in a theory that completely abandons the concept of force ?",
    "does it hold in the absence of the concept of force ?    from the above",
    ", it should now be evident that the general principle of relativity stands even when the concept of force is abandoned because it only deals with the _ observable _ concept of an acceleration of a material body . specifically , in the context of einstein s equivalence principle , it rests only on the observation that uniform gravity imparts the same acceleration to all the bodies .",
    "now , it is crucial to recognize that the equivalence principle establishes only the _ consistency _ of the phenomenon of gravitation with the general principle of relativity .",
    "clearly , the equivalence principle _ is not logically equivalent _ to the general principle of relativity .    as noted earlier , einstein had , certainly , been quite careful to use the word `` suggestive '' in stating the relation of these two _ different _ principles .",
    "he further wrote in @xcite :    @xmath2 ... in pursuing the general theory of relativity we shall be led to a theory of gravitation , since we are able to `` produce '' a gravitational field merely by changing the system of coordinates .",
    "@xmath2    but , in spite of the phenomenon of gravitation being consistent with the general principle of relativity , there could , in principle , exist other physical phenomena which could be inconsistent with the general principle of relativity .",
    "this would have been the situation if newton s theory had shown us the existence of some `` fundamental real force '' distinguishing accelerated frames from the inertial frames but that force `` explaining '' the observed motions of material bodies .",
    "this last is , of course , not the situation and we therefore have the faith that the general principle of relativity should be the basis of any `` satisfactory '' physical theory .",
    "moreover , the `` verifiability '' of the motion in mach s arguments considered earlier is also indicative of the `` universality '' of the general principle of relativity .    from the above",
    ", it should then be clear that the general principle of relativity can be reached from more than one vantage issues .",
    "each such issue can then indicate only that some physical phenomenon related to that issue is _ consistent _ with this principle of relativity .",
    "the mutual consistency of the general principle of relativity and various physical conceptions then becomes the requirement of a satisfactory physical theory .",
    "therefore , physical construction of the frames of reference , the _ physical coordination _ of the _ physical space _ using measuring rods , is also one of the primary requirements of the satisfactory theory based on the general principle of relativity .",
    "then , it should now be also clear that the _ universal theory of relativity _ , a physical theory explicitly based on the general principle of relativity , will not be just a theory of gravitation but , of necessity , also the _ theory of everything_. it is certainly decisive to recognize this .",
    "_ therefore , a theory which abandons the concept of force completely can `` explain '' the phenomenon of gravitation by demonstrating that the decrement of distance between material bodies is , _ in certain situations _ , independent of their material contents and physical state .",
    "_ by showing this , a theory of the aforementioned type can incorporate the phenomenon of gravitation .    why is this above mentioned demonstration expected to hold only in _ certain situations _ ?    to grasp the essentials here ,",
    "let us recall that , in newton s theory , only the _ total force _ acting on a physical body is used by newton s second law of motion .",
    "we usually also _ decompose _ this force into different parts in the well known manner as the one arising due to gravity , the one arising due to electrostatic force etc .",
    "but , what matters in newton s theory for the motion of any physical body is the total force acting on it and not the decomposition of this total force in parts , the decomposition , strictly speaking , being quite _ irrelevant_.    thus , the phenomenon of gravitation is , then , `` displayed '' by material bodies , essentially , only in _",
    "certain situations _ , those for which the total force is that due to gravity .",
    "this above is , in overall , the significance of the general principle of relativity .",
    "now , what are our general expectations from any `` new '' theory then ?",
    "clearly , the concept of the inertia of a material body is _ more fundamental _ than that of the force because the conception of gravitational force requires the introduction of gravitational mass which is conceptually very different but `` equals '' the inertia in value to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "hence , only the newtonian concept of force comes under scrutiny for modifications .",
    "therefore , it must be adequately recognized that the newtonian concept of `` force '' will have to be abandoned in the process of developing the new theoretical framework . in other words ,",
    "the `` cause '' behind the motions of material bodies will have to be conceptually entirely different than has been considered by newton s theory .",
    "consequently , `` agreements '' of the results of the new theory with the corresponding ones of newton s theory can only be _ mathematical _ of nature .",
    "the physical conceptions behind the mathematical statements of the new theory will not be those of newton s theory .",
    "therefore , any explanation of the phenomenon of gravitation in the new theory will only involve the demonstration of the `` decrement of distance '' under certain situations involving material bodies .",
    "it must , of course , be shown that this decrement in distance is , for these situations , such that the `` acceleration '' of the bodies is independent of their material content and the physical state .",
    "it must also be shown that the `` known '' inverse - square dependence of this phenomenon arises in the new theory in some mathematical manner .    any such `` new theory '' must then explain the `` origin '' of the inertia of material bodies .",
    "it must also incorporate the `` physical '' construction of the coordinate system that must , necessarily , change with the motions of material bodies in the `` physical '' space . without the appropriate incorporation of these two issues ,",
    "no theory can be considered to be physically satisfactory .",
    "any such `` new '' theory needs also `` explain '' the equality of the _ inertial _ and the _ gravitational _ mass of a material body .",
    "the equality of these two entirely different physical conceptions , even with experimental uncertainties , is a sure indication that the _ same quality _ of a material body manifests itself , according to circumstances , as its inertia or as its weight ( heaviness ) .",
    "but , it must be remembered that the concept of the gravitational mass and that of the electrostatic charge owe their origins to the newtonian concept of the force .    but",
    ", the `` source properties '' can not be basic to the new theory that abandons the concept of the force .",
    "consequently , the gravitational mass of the material body will not be fundamental to the new theory , but the inertial mass will be . some `` entity '' that replaces the electrostatic charge will also be basic to the new theory .",
    "then , it must also follow from the mathematical framework of the new theory that the inertial mass can also be `` naturally '' considered as the `` source '' in the mathematical quantity that can be the newtonian gravitational force .",
    "similarly , the quantity that , in the new theory , replaces the electrostatic charge must also naturally appear as the `` source '' in the mathematical quantity that can be considered to be coulomb s electrostatic force .",
    "furthermore , we need to demand that the `` new '' theory must also not contain the law of motion which is `` independent '' of the law of the force . that is to say , the force as an external quantity , to be `` specified '' separately of the law of motion , must not occur in this new theory . in it",
    ", we can only have the law of motion .",
    "crucially , abandonment of the concept of force that is independent of the law of motion applies , at the same time , to `` every kind of ( fundamental ) force '' postulated to be acting between the material particles by newton s theory .    therefore , the _ conceptual framework as well as the mathematical formalism or procedure _ by which we `` replace '' the concept of force ( as an `` external cause of motion '' independent of the law of motion ) _ will have to be applicable to every kind of ( fundamental ) force that newton s or any other theory has to postulate or assume to explain the observed motions of material bodies_.    the _ principle of the simplicity _ ( of theoretical construction ) dictates that this above must be the case for a satisfactory theory .",
    "replacing only the concept of the gravitational force is then unacceptable not only from this point of view of the simplicity but also because the resultant theory then can not account for the entirety of charged material bodies within its hybrid framework .",
    "charged material bodies will have to be the singularities of the electrostatic force but not of the gravitational force in the mathematical framework of such a hybrid theory .",
    "any such hybrid framework is then bound to be physically inconsistent and , hence , unacceptable .",
    "then , the mathematical procedure by which we replace the notion of , say , newton s gravitational force _ can not _ be expected to be entirely _ different _ than the one adopted , say , for replacing the notion of coulomb s electrostatic force .",
    "now , einstein attempted to replace the notion of _ force _ with that of the _ curvature _ of the spacetime manifold .",
    "then , this replacement must also be applicable to every notion of force in newton s theory .",
    "in particular , it must apply to coulomb s electrostatic force .",
    "then , coulomb s electrostatic force can be attractive as well as repulsive depending on the `` relative '' signs of the involved electric charges .",
    "an immediate implication of this above for einstein s aforementioned attempt is that the relative sign of charges determines the curvature for the geometry `` experienced '' by them .",
    "but , how this is to be achieved is unclear .",
    "einstein s field equations with matter do not implement this in any non - singular manner .",
    "moreover , what about origins of electric charges that are to determine the curvature ?",
    "we may then conclude that the concept of the curvature of geometry is y g to replace the notion of force .",
    "now , the concept of force is , in a definite mathematical sense @xcite , _ equivalent _ to that of certain transformation of the points of the ( euclidean ) space in newton s theory .",
    "this then `` suggests '' that mathematical transformations of points of the ( suitable underlying ) space can , quite generally as well as naturally , `` replace '' the newtonian concept of force as a cause of motion .    a transformation which `` brings '' two bodies `` together '' corresponds to an attractive force between them while the one which `` pushes '' these bodies `` away '' from each other corresponds to a repulsive force between them .",
    "moreover , the action of a transformation can `` naturally '' depend on some parameters ( eg , electric charges )",
    ". we may then be able to incorporate coulomb s law ( and other laws of force ) in a framework based on transformation of some suitable ( mathematical ) space as a possible generalization of the newtonian conception of force as a cause of motion .    evidently therefore , the concept of transformation pp to be y g to replace the ( newtonian ) notion of force .",
    "it should then be also evident that the mathematical laws obtainable using this replacement of force by the transformation of suitable underlying space will be applicable to _ every physically constructed frame of reference _ , and , hence , this mathematical formalism will be in conformity with the general principle of relativity .",
    "it should then be equally clear that the phenomenon of gravitation is incorporated in this framework as the concept of transformation is `` applicable '' in all the relevant situations .",
    "this then brings us to issues of the quantum considerations within the theme of the universal theory of relativity whose certain characteristics we have considered above .",
    "now , bohr had captured @xcite the `` essence '' of the quantum theory in the following succinct words :    @xmath2 ... _ the quantum theory is characterized by the acknowledgement of a fundamental limitation in the classical physical ideas when applied to atomic phenomena . ... the so - called quantum postulate , which attributes to any atomic process an essential discontinuity , or rather individuality , completely foreign to the classical theories . ... _    _ ... strictly speaking , the idea of observation belongs to the causal spacetime way of description . ... according to the quantum theory , just the impossibility of neglecting the interaction with the agency of measurement means that every observation introduces a new uncontrollable element . ...",
    "_    _ this postulate implies a renunciation as regards the causal spacetime coordination of atomic processes .",
    "indeed , our usual description of physical phenomena is based entirely on the idea that the phenomena concerned may be observed without disturbing them appreciably .",
    "this appears , for example , clearly in the theory of relativity , which has been so fruitful for the elucidation of the classical theories . as emphasized by einstein ,",
    "every observation or measurement ultimately rests on the coincidence of two independent events at the same spacetime point .",
    "just these coincidences will not be affected by any differences which the spacetime coordination of different observers may exhibit .",
    "now , the quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected .",
    "accordingly , an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation . ... _",
    "@xmath2    indeed , the quantum theory is then supposed to acknowledge an essential limitation of the classical newtonian ideas by recognizing that any observation of a physical system involves , necessarily , an uncontrollable disturbance of that physical system .",
    "this is , in spirit , similar to the special theory of relativity acknowledging a fundamental fact that we , ordinarily , use electromagnetic radiation , light , to observe material bodies @xcite .",
    "the quantum hypothesis , through heisenberg s indeterminacy relations @xcite , then renders the _ exact _ measurability of the coordination of the space and the time questionable indeed .",
    "this is the decisive role of indeterminacy relations .",
    "then , let us consider that an observer chooses a certain spatial location as the origin of the coordinate system and intends to attach _ spatial labels _ to various events in the vicinity with respect to it .",
    "the observer needs to use a _ measuring rod _ , made using physical matter , to achieve this .",
    "the observer intends to also attach suitable _ temporal labels _ to each event in the vicinity . for this purpose",
    ", the observer then needs to place , at each suitable location in the vicinity , near the `` physical events '' to be observed , physical bodies executing periodic motions as _ clocks_.    but , by the quantum postulate , these concepts must involve _ indeterminacies_. neither the origin of the coordinate system nor the coordinate labels can be determined in a _ physical measurement _ any more accurately than permitted by heisenberg s relevant indeterminacy relation . the _ physical _",
    "coordination used by an observer _ can not _ then be identical with the ( mathematical ) coordination of the underlying continuum , if any .",
    "but , this last is also the implication of the issues involved with even the physical construction of the coordinate frames .",
    "recall from  [ idea - basis ] that the `` coordinate axes '' of the reference frame must be using physical matter , and , in general , motions of other material bodies must affect the coordinate axes .",
    "now , to attach coordinate labels to various spatial locations , the observer needs to `` move '' the `` measuring rod '' suitably and measure distances to these locations .",
    "but , changes must , in general , result to the coordinate axes due to the motion of the measuring rod .",
    "therefore , the observer will _ not _ be able to measure _ exactly _ the distances necessary to label the spatial locations",
    ".    the same also applies to the measurement of the physical time since any physical clock must be constructed from physical matter and any such measurement involves the measurement of the location of the hands of the clock .",
    "once again , we see even here that the _ physical _ coordination used by an observer _ can not _ be identical with the ( mathematical ) coordination of the underlying continuum , if any .",
    "it is then natural to expect that these issues of the physical construction of the coordinate axes and those of the quantum postulate are related to each other in some manner .",
    "but , of course , the observer will be able to `` neglect '' these changes to the coordinate axes in some situations .",
    "then , in approximation , the observer could peruse the classical equations .",
    "now , in newton s theory , ordinary material bodies are considered as some `` rigid '' or `` non - rigid '' collection of material points , bound together by inter - particle forces .",
    "`` spatial extensions and associated properties '' of material bodies then arise in newton s theory only from such conceptions .    in newton",
    "s theory , a _",
    "physical _ rod is then to be treated as such a spatially extended physical object . of course",
    ", we then can not determine the distances of locations from a chosen origin any more accurately than the chosen unit - the spatial extension of the chosen physical rod . to be able to do any better",
    ", we need to `` divide '' the physical rod into smaller parts . within newton s overall theoretical scheme ,",
    "this is , evidently , the conceptual origin of the involved experimental limitations of the distance measurement .",
    "however , in principle , the distance measurements can be as accurate as desired in newton s theory .",
    "but , when the concept of force is abandoned , as has to be the situation with the `` universal theory of relativity , '' the aforementioned newtonian conception of an `` extended physical object '' too will have to be suitably replaced .",
    "now , bohr s approach @xcite _ permits _ us to postulate , notably , an _ exactly localizable material point _",
    ", a classical newtonian particle , to represent a physical body but shifts the onus of the indeterminateness of its location entirely on the process of measurement , a physical process constituted `` externally '' to the system being observed .",
    "the use of classical concepts to describe an experimental arrangement is the basis of bohr s approach .",
    "recall from @xcite :    @xmath2 ... by the word `` experiment '' we refer to a situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we have learned and that , therefore , the account of the experimental arrangement and of the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics .",
    "this crucial point , ... , implies the _ impossibility of any sharp separation between the behavior of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear_. ... consequently , evidence obtained under different experimental conditions can not be comprehended within a single picture , but must be regarded as _",
    "complementary _ in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhausts the possible information about the objects .    under these circumstances",
    "an essential element of ambiguity is involved in ascribing conventional physical attributes to atomic objects , as is at once evident in the dilemma regarding the corpuscular and wave properties of electrons and photons , where we have to do with contrasting pictures , each referring to an essential aspect of empirical evidence . ...",
    "@xmath2    bohr then insists on the use of `` classical ideas '' ( including the concept of force ) for the `` description '' of the quantum properties of matter .",
    "only the `` classical concepts '' permit him an _ experimental arrangement to be constituted externally _ to the system being observed because these concepts involve agencies , forces , fundamentally external to any conceivable system .",
    "but , the newtonian point - particle then can not describe the `` evidence '' related to the wave phenomena displayed by electrons , say .",
    "as shown by heisenberg @xcite , the corpuscular picture is limited by the indeterminacy relations , which are then interpreted to mean a definite lack of sharp distinction between the interaction of electron with the instrument and the observed physical phenomenon involving electrons .",
    "bohr s is then a `` hybrid '' approach that uses classical concepts without `` fundamentally changing '' those concepts .",
    "but , it associates probability aspects with the classical concepts .",
    "recall from @xcite :    @xmath2 _ ... any arrangement suited to study the exchange of energy and momentum between the electron and the photon must involve a latitude in the space - time description of the interaction sufficient for the definition of wave - number and frequency ... conversely , any attempt of locating the collision between the photon and the electron more accurately would , on account of the unavoidable interaction with the fixed scales and clocks defining the the space - time reference frame , exclude all closer account as regards the balance of energy and momentum_.    _ ... an adequate tool for a complementary way of description is offered precisely by the quantum mechanical formalism which represents a purely symbolic scheme permitting only predictions , on lines of the correspondence principle , as to results obtainable under conditions specified by means of classical concepts . ... thus , a sentence like `` we can not know both the momentum and the position of an atomic object '' raises at once questions as to the physical reality of two such attributes of the object , which can be answered only by referring to the conditions for the unambiguous use of the space - time concepts , on the one hand , and dynamical conservation laws , on the other hand . while the combination of these concepts into a single picture of a causal chain of events is the essence of classical mechanics , room for regularities beyond the grasp of such a description is just afforded by the circumstance that the study of the complementary phenomena demands mutually exclusive experimental arrangements .",
    "_ @xmath2    when the classical concepts are retained without fundamental modifications , the `` quantum postulate '' _ imposes _ the viewpoint that certain classical concepts are `` complementary '' in accounting for the physical experiences .",
    "bohr @xcite then explains the indeterminacy relations as mathematical realizations of the complementarity of the involved classical conceptions and supports their probabilistic basis .",
    "recall , once again from @xcite , that bohr had been `` critical '' of even the conceptual foundations of the relativity theory :    @xmath2 _ ... causal description is upheld in relativity theory within any given frame of reference , but in quantum theory the uncontrollable interaction between the objects and the measuring instruments forces us to a renunciation even in such respect .",
    "_ @xmath2 and went on to express optimism that :    @xmath2 _ ... the viewpoint of complementarity may be regarded as a rational generalization of the very ideal of causality . _",
    "@xmath2    whether this optimism can be upheld in a `` hybrid '' approach , as is bohr s , is doubtful .",
    "now , as seen before , certain newtonian concepts , in particular , the concept of force , will have to be fundamentally abandoned to accommodate the general principle of relativity .",
    "consequently , in the context of various implications of the general principle of relativity , bohr s complementarity hypothesis will be `` limited '' as an explanation of the indeterminacy relations whose basis must now be sought within only the context of those implications .",
    "thence , in relation to the above discussion , we now recall from  [ gent ] that , in the universal theory of relativity , transformations of the points of the underlying space are to replace , naturally , the notion of force in newton s theory .",
    "a transformation of the points of the underlying space is the only `` cause '' of the motion of a chosen material body in the universal theory of relativity .",
    "then , a transformation of the underlying space can be performed which does _ not _ affect the material body whose location is being measured , but `` moves '' only the measuring rod in use in the manner desired by the observer for the involved measurement .",
    "notably , such a transformation is to represent then `` all '' the actions , including that of the ( electromagnetic ) radiation , if any , in the same measurement process .",
    "now , if a material body were to be representable as an `` exactly localizable material point '' within this theoretical framework then , it would be possible to measure the `` exact '' location of that material body by employing a transformation of the aforementioned type .",
    "[ in this context , we note that force in newton s theory can be looked upon as a transformation of the points of the euclidean space .",
    "newton s theory represents a physical body as an exactly localizable material point .",
    "then , it is possible in newton s theory to measure the exact location of the material point because a transformation that does not affect the material point but moves only the measuring rod is permissible . ]    in other words , we could locate , exactly , a material point by moving a measuring rod by its side without affecting the location of that material point since a transformation of the underlying space that achieves this , including light to `` see '' the process , is , now , thinkable .    this would , however , violate the indeterminacy relations which arise , naturally , from the quantum postulate that has the impeccable support of the empirical evidence of great value .    _",
    "then , in the context of the general principle of relativity , the quantum postulate implies that it must be impossible in the theory to hypothesize an exactly localizable material point to represent a physical object .",
    "_ hence , an _ intrinsic indeterminacy _ in the location of a material point representing a physical body is implied here .    in the universal theory of relativity , the origin of heisenberg s indeterminacy relations",
    "will then be a combination of this _ intrinsic indeterminacy _ in the location of a material point representing a material body and the transformation of the underlying space that is the `` cause '' of the motion of that material point .",
    "an `` act of observation '' involves transformation of points of the underlying space representing the observed physical system and also of points of the space representing the used measuring apparatus .",
    "then , transformations of the underlying space and intrinsic indeterminacies are the keys to quantum aspects of matter .",
    "now , a transformation of the points of the underlying space is to represent _ unique evolution _ of a physical system fixed _ deterministically _ by the initial conditions .",
    "( see , for details ,  [ mf ] . )",
    "then , an observation of a physical system may involve the `` disturbance '' of that particular system , but not an uncontrollable or unpredictable disturbance .",
    "the viewpoint that `` any act of observation of a physical system involves , necessarily , an uncontrollable disturbance of that physical system '' will have to be rested therefore .    _",
    "the quantum hypothesis thus acknowledges the existence of an _ intrinsic indeterminacy _ in the very conceptualization of a material point to represent a physical body_. the mathematical formalism of the universal theory of relativity must then respect this acknowledgement .",
    "this is , now , the `` true essence '' of the quantum postulate .",
    "then , having renounced newtonian conceptions at a fundamental level , we needed to `` reanalyze '' various such aspects as discussed above .",
    "recapitulating , moving a material body from its given `` location '' should cause changes to the construction of the coordinate system and , hence , to the `` physical geometry '' because the construction of the coordinate system is the basis of the `` metric function '' of the geometry .    in turn ,",
    "`` given the metric or the distance function of the geometry '' we would know how the totality of _ all _ the material bodies are `` located '' relative to each other .",
    "hence , the physical geometry is determined by material bodies which , in turn , are also determined by the physical geometry .",
    "however , the issue remains of physical characteristics of material bodies such as , for example , their inertia , electrostatic charge etc .",
    "recalling implications of the quantum postulate here , these physical `` qualities '' of material bodies must , basically , be `` definable '' for various subsets , but _ not _ for any _ singleton subset _ , of the underlying space .",
    "( a singleton subset would otherwise be an `` exactly localizable '' material point . ) but , such aspects belong to the framework of the mathematical theory of measures @xcite .    the physical `` qualities '' of matter are then to be treated as _",
    "measures _ defined on certain subsets of the underlying continuum .",
    "such subsets are then the _ basic _ physical objects for the universal theory of relativity and each physical object can be viewed , necessarily , as a _",
    "_ @xcite of the corresponding measure space .",
    "but , a measure can be averaged over a measurable set , the average being a property of each point of that set .",
    "the averaged measure then provides @xcite the non - singular notion of a point - object with the physical characteristics .",
    "but , the `` location '' of the point - object so defined is _ indeterminate _ within the measurable set .",
    "this mathematical situation is precisely in accord with the requirement as imposed by the quantum postulate on the mathematical formalism of the universal theory of relativity .",
    "then , the _ physical distance _ separating two material objects is the appropriate _ mathematical distance _ between the corresponding measurable sets .",
    "`` kinematical '' quantities such as `` velocity '' and `` acceleration '' ( for one measurable set relatively to another measurable set ) involve change in the so - defined physical distance under the action of the transformation @xmath21 of the underlying space .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 of @xmath21 `` defines '' time in an appropriate sense as will be discussed later in  [ mf ] .",
    "various physical phenomena can then arise from the effects of transformations of the underlying space on the measurable sets and the measures defined on them .",
    "this is then the framework of the theory of dynamical systems",
    ".    then , these ideas as well as their mathematical renderings are , evidently , fundamentally different from those of newton s theory , of special relativity and , of orthodox quantum theory .",
    "notably , there `` do not occur ''",
    "any `` physical constants '' to be `` specified by hand '' in this above framework .",
    "but , _ all _ the physical constants can arise in this framework only from `` mutual relationships '' of involved physical objects , just exactly as we determine them experimentally .    for example ,",
    "consider the phenomenon of gravitation within the present conceptual framework .",
    "it involves the action of @xmath21 for which the `` acceleration '' experienced by one measurable set , in relation to another reference measurable set , is _ independent _ of the `` measure '' defined on that set , but is proportional to the measure defined on the reference measurable set , both measure classes being invariant under @xmath21 .",
    "( in general , measures change under the action of @xmath21 . )",
    "newton s gravitational constant then `` arises '' when `` acceleration '' is expressed as the `` inverse - square '' of the physical distance .",
    "( this demonstration is , of course , somewhat involved , and will be the subject of an independent study . ) clearly , the possibility of theoretically obtaining the `` value '' of newton s constant of gravitation can be seen to arise in this manner within the overall framework of the universal relativity .",
    "furthermore , it should also be equally clear that , within universal relativity , other physical constants can similarly `` arise '' from different permissible situations , mutual relationships of measurable sets and the effects of transformations of the underlying space on them .",
    "clearly , the `` values '' of such physical constants can not be changed `` without '' destroying the theory and this situation is , precisely , as per einstein s theorem @xcite ( p. 63 ) quoted earlier .",
    "this above is recognizable as an extremely important issue for any complete physical theory . whether such theoretically obtained values of the fundamental physical constants",
    "are also their experimentally determined values is then another extremely important issue for us .",
    "notably , an observer , possessing any consciousness or not , has only the `` background '' role to play in the universal theory of relativity .",
    "nowhere in this theory , in its explanations of physical phenomena , do we require the `` intervention '' by an `` observer . ''",
    "the problems of incorporating a conscious observer within its conceptual framework do not therefore arise .",
    "newton s theory also had the same role for an observer .",
    "transformation of the underlying space is then a _ unique evolution _ of the points of the space .",
    "it therefore represents _ unique evolution of a physical system `` fixed '' deterministically by the initial conditions_. consequently , the universal theory of relativity provides therefore @xcite `` the complete description of any individual real situation as it supposedly exists irrespective of any act of observation or substantiation . ''",
    "importantly , it should also be clear at this stage of our considerations that in pursuing the universal theory of relativity we shall be led to explanations of general physical phenomena that are `` radically different '' from those of the newtonian ways as well as from those of the ways of the orthodox ( probabilistic ) quantum theory .    in this above context",
    ", it needs to be stressed , and re - stressed , that p would be p within the overall framework of the universal theory of relativity by treating the `` standard forces '' as corresponding transformations of some suitable space underlying the universal theory of relativity .",
    "needless to say , we will then have to analyze , in the framework of universal relativity , each of the known physical phenomena case by case to check if certain new predictions are permissible for the case under study .",
    "an example of such a type is provided in  [ results ] in the form of an analysis of the torsion balance experiment . in particular",
    ", the use of the newtonian gravitational force implies that the torsion balance will always be torqued when some external masses are moved around it .",
    "as had been remarked earlier , the existence of torqued motion of the torsion balance is explainable in universal relativity by treating the newtonian total force on it as a corresponding transformation of the space underlying the universal theory of relativity .",
    "however , in universal relativity , there does occur a situation when the transformation of the underlying space does not act on the torsion balance to produce its oscillatory motion even when the external masses are moved around it .",
    "in this situation , a null result obtains irrespective of the speed of motion of external masses .",
    "certainly , a very careful torsion balance experiment involving y needs to be designed to verify this null effect situation .",
    "perhaps , some very carefully selected geometrical design of the torsion balance experiment may also be needed for this purpose .",
    "we conclude this section ,  [ pf ] , with the following remarks that highlight the spirit behind our endeavors of this discussion .",
    "the approach followed in this discussion , of  [ pf ] , presents the universal theory of relativity as an appealing , but not as a simplest , system of thoughts .",
    "we essentially developed the physical foundations of this theory as being psychologically `` natural '' or appealing .",
    "one could however perceive this approach as also being a logically compelling one .",
    "this is primarily because , apart from the concept of transformation of suitable space , there appears to be no another sufficiently general mathematical concept to replace the newtonian notion of force , it also being in conformity with the general principle of relativity and , simultaneously , allowing the physical constructions of reference frames to be affected by motions of other bodies .    granted this above and having then laid the physical foundations for the universal theory of relativity in sufficient details , let us now turn to mathematical aspects implied by these considerations .",
    "mathematical foundations for this theory then rest on the mathematical theories of measures and dynamical systems , both .",
    "this much is a certain conclusion of the above .",
    "in einstein s ( and descartes s ) conceptions @xcite , _ physical geometry _ is not any inert stage for the physical fields . this notion of _ physical geometry _ will be made precise in the following .",

    "the killing equation holds also for a riemannian pseudo - metric ( abraham & marsden , @xcite , p.  144 - 157 ) . in general",

    "a p - set of @xmath2461 is never a singleton subset of @xmath2395 when the functions @xmath2462 are as chosen .",

    "note also that every open set of @xmath2453 is _ not _ a p - set of @xmath2463 .",
    "for example , a proper subset of a p - set of @xmath2463 will not be a p - set of @xmath2463 but it can be an open set of @xmath2453 .    by construction ,",
    "any two distinct p - sets , @xmath2032 and @xmath2464 , @xmath2465 , @xmath2466 , are _ pairwise disjoint subsets _ of @xmath2395 .",

    "furthermore , each p - set is , in own right , an uncountable polish space with @xmath2467 as a metric compatible with its ( induced ) polish topology .",
    "being members of the borel @xmath474-algebra @xmath2455 of the space @xmath2395 , the p - sets are ( borel ) measurable and , for specific @xmath2441 , the collection of all the p - sets is a measurable ( mod 0 ) partition of the space @xmath2395 . hence , _",
    "( lebesgue ) measures _ and _ signed _ measures on @xmath2395 are natural for us to consider .    therefore , to every class of ( lebesgue ) measures on such p - sets we can associate an appropriate physical property of a _ material body_.",
    "a material body is always an _ extended body _ , since a p - set can not be a singleton subset of @xmath2395 .",
    "the integration of measures on p - sets is always a well - defined one , now for obvious mathematical reasons .",
    "a chosen measure can be integrated over a p - set and an average value of the measure always obtainable .",
    "this average value of measure provides then an `` averaged quantity '' characteristic of a p - set . evidently , this `` average '' is a property of the entire p - set under consideration and , therefore , of _ every point _ of that p - set .",
    "a point of the p - set is then thinkable as having these averaged properties of the p - set and , in this precise non - singular sense , is thinkable as a ( newtonian ) _ point - particle _ possessing those averaged properties . in this non - singular sense ,",
    "points of the space @xmath2395 become point particles .",
    "in essence , we have , in a non - singular manner , then `` recovered '' the ( newtonian ) notion of a point particle from that of our notion of a field - the underlying continuum @xmath2395 .",
    "further , the `` location '' of this point - particle will be _ indeterminate _ over the _ size _ of that p - set because the averaged property is also the property of every point of the set under consideration .",
    "the individuality of a point particle is then that of the corresponding p - set .",
    "now , for a specific pseudo - metric @xmath2441 , corresponding collection @xmath1706 of all p - sets forms a measurable ( mod 0 ) partition of the space @xmath2395 . recalling our earlier terminology , a p - set is then a _ basic ( physical ) object_. standard borel sets in @xmath2455 which are the unions of the members of the measurable ( mod 0 ) partition @xmath1706 , now the p - sets , are then the _ compound ( physical ) objects_.    measures can also be integrated over compound ( physical ) objects and a point of @xmath2395 in the object is then also thinkable as a ( newtonian ) point particle with these physical properties .",
    "location of such a point particle is then indeterminate over the size of that object .",
    "then , the points of the underlying space @xmath2395 can also be attributed ( physical ) properties averaged over the size of an object .",
    "hence , we can also represent an object under consideration as a ( newtonian ) point particle .",
    "therefore , we have the required characteristics of descartes s and einstein s conceptions incorporated in the present formalism .",
    "clearly , we have then the non - singular notion of a point particle as well as that of replacing any extended physical body by such a non - singular point particle .",
    "furthermore , physical bodies are also represented as non - singular regions of the space @xmath2395 .",
    "thence , the union of the space and the physical objects is clearly perceptible here .",
    "since @xmath2468 is a standard borel space , any measurable , one - one map of @xmath2395 onto itself is a borel automorphism .",
    "therefore , the borel automorphisms of @xmath2468 , forming a group , are natural for us to consider here .",
    "the borel automorphisms of an uncountable polish space have been the subject of a recent study @xcite .    as any borel automorphism of the underlying space @xmath2395 maps a chosen p - set or a @xmath1706-set to another , the integrated properties may change and , consequently , the ( initial ) characteristics of particle of that p - set/@xmath1706-set may change .    [ in this case , it is possible to adopt two views . in the first one ,",
    "the active point of view , we imagine that a chosen p - set or an @xmath1706-set itself changes under the action of the borel transformation of @xmath2395 and `` track '' these changes . in the second ,",
    "the passive point of view , we imagine that the action of the borel transformation of @xmath2395 only maps a given ( measurable ) set onto ( measurable ) another and track the changes in measures .",
    "we note that the standard methods of the theories of measures as well as dynamical systems adopt the passive point of view and , it seems that the active point of view is more closer to the physicist s ways of thinking . ]",
    "now , the _ hausdorff metric _ provides the distance separating p - sets and also the distance separating @xmath1706-sets .",
    "this distance between sets will , henceforth , be called the _ physical distance _ between p - sets or @xmath1706-sets ( extended physical bodies ) because `` measurement in the physical sense '' can be expected to yield only this quantity as distance separating physical objects .",
    "measure - preserving borel automorphisms of the space @xmath2395 then `` transform '' a given set maintaining its characteristic classes of ( lebesgue ) measures , that is , its physical properties .",
    "non - measure - preserving borel automorphisms change the characteristic classes of lebesgue measures ( physical properties ) of a set while `` transforming '' it .",
    "evidently , such considerations also apply to even @xmath1706-sets .    at this point",
    ", we note that a general automorphism of the space @xmath2395 has two parts : one measure - preserving and one non measure - preserving .",
    "this decomposition is maintained ( mod 0 ) .",
    "hence , only the measure - preserving transformations are studied in the theory of dynamical systems .    then , a _ periodic _ borel automorphism or",
    "_ periodic component of _ borel automorphism @xcite of @xmath2395 will lead to an _ oscillatory motion _ of a set while preserving or not preserving its measures .",
    "therefore , a basic or compound ( physical ) object undergoing periodic motion is a physical clock in the present framework .",
    "such an object undergoing oscillatory motion then `` displays '' the time - parameter of the corresponding ( periodic ) borel automorphism since the period of the motion of such an object is precisely the period of the corresponding borel automorphism .    then , within the present formalism , a _ measuring clock _ is therefore any @xmath1706-set or an object undergoing _ periodic motion_. an @xmath1706-set or an object can also be used as a _ measuring rod_.    therefore , in the present theoretical framework , measuring apparatuses , measuring rods and measuring clocks , are on par with every other thing that the formalism intends to treat .    a borel automorphism of @xmath2454 may change the physical distance resulting into `` relative motion '' of objects .",
    "we also note here that the sets invariant under the specific borel automorphism are characteristic of that automorphism .",
    "hence , such sets will then have their `` relative '' distance `` fixed '' under that borel automorphism and will be stationary relative to each other .",
    "now , in a precise sense , it follows that the position of the point - particle ( of averaged characteristics of its associated @xmath1706-set ) is `` determinable '' more and more accurately as the size of that @xmath1706-set gets smaller and smaller .",
    "but , complete localization of a point particle is not permissible here since an @xmath1706-set is never a singleton subset of @xmath2395 .",
    "the location of the point particle is then always `` indeterminate '' to the extent of the size of its @xmath1706-set .",
    "clearly , this is an intrinsic indeterminacy that can not be overcome in any manner .",
    "furthermore , a borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395 results in a `` relative motion '' of @xmath1706-sets and , hence , of associated particles .",
    "clearly , therefore , a joint manifestation of borel automorphisms of the space @xmath2469 and the intrinsic indeterminacy in the location of a point particle , of averaged measures on an @xmath1706-set , is a candidate reason behind heisenberg s indeterminacy relations in universal relativity .",
    "this is in complete contrast to their probabilistic origin as advocated by the standard formalism of the quantum theory .",
    "notice now that , in the present considerations , we began with none of the fundamental considerations of the concept of a quantum .",
    "but , one of the basic characteristics of the conception of a quantum , heisenberg s indeterminacy relation , emerged out of the present formalism .",
    "furthermore , in the present framework , we have also done away with the `` singular nature '' of the particles and , hence , also with the unsatisfactory dualism of the field ( space ) and the source particle .",
    "we also have , simultaneously , well - defined laws of motion ( borel automorphisms ) for the field ( space ) and also for the well - defined conception of a point particle ( of averaged measure characteristics of an basic or compound object ) .",
    "then , the present formalism is a _",
    "complete _ field theory .",
    "[ at this point , we then also note that the borel automorphisms of @xmath2395 need not be differentiable or , for that matter , even continuous .",
    "therefore , the present considerations also use , for the most fundamental formalism of physics , a mathematical structure different than that of the partial differential equations .",
    "however , the question of the physical significance of non - differentiable and non - continuous borel automorphisms of @xmath2395 is a subject of independent detailed study . ]    now , any act of measurement is conceivable here only as a borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395 .",
    "then , the measurability of any characteristic of a point particle as defined in the present framework is dependent on the `` borel automorphism '' to be used .",
    "but , from active point of view , that borel automorphism may change the very basic or compound object of measurement .",
    "[ this above situation could as well be an additional `` reason '' behind some indeterminacy relations .",
    "the demonstration of the proposed origin(s ) of indeterminacy relations will be the subject of an independent study . ]",
    "the `` determined or observed '' characteristic of a particle is a _ different _ conception here than its intrinsic characteristics .",
    "the former notion clearly depends on the borel automorphism to be used for the measurement .",
    "for example , the `` observed velocity or momentum '' of a particle is a conception dependent on the notion of the physical distance changing under the action of a borel automorphism of @xmath2395 . clearly , the coordination of the underlying continuum @xmath2395 has nothing whatsoever to do with the measurability here .",
    "importantly , dynamical systems on space @xmath2395 follow the `` strict determinism '' in that the space coordinates map _ uniquely _ under the action of a borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395",
    ".    however , this is _ not _ the same `` causality '' as that of the newtonian physical formulation .",
    "the strict causality of newtonian conceptions implies that given precise position and velocity of a particle at a given moment and the total force acting on it , we can predict the precise position and velocity of that particle at any later moment using appropriate laws .    in the present context",
    ", strict newtonian causality would have demanded that the position and the velocity of a point - particle ( definable in the present formalism as a point of the @xmath1706-set with associated averaged measures ) be exactly determinable .",
    "this is of course not the situation for dynamical systems on the space @xmath2395 .",
    "but , _ reality independent of any act of observation _ , is then ascribable to the phenomena as well as to the agencies of observation in this formalism . since physical objects are the regions of the space and vice versa , the `` existence '' of the @xmath1706-sets of the space @xmath2395 is the `` existence '' of physical objects .",
    "this `` existence '' of physical bodies is , obviously , independent of any act of observation .",
    "moreover , as we have seen earlier , the role of an observer in the proposed universal theory of relativity is very similar to that of an observer in newton s theory .",
    "this should not be construed in any manner as an `` accidental '' situation .",
    "this is for the following reasons .",
    "the proposed universal theory of relativity generalizes only the notion of force in newton s theory to that of transformations of an appropriate standard borel space @xmath2395 and `` derives '' an appropriate concept of ( newtonian ) particle from the structure of this space .",
    "the borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395 is , obviously , the _ cause _ behind an `` observable effect '' on the @xmath1706-set or , equivalently , a physical object .",
    "consequently , to associate a definite cause to a definite effect has an appropriate sense in the present formalism and this `` sense '' is independent of an observer .",
    "any intervention by any , conscious or not , observer is therefore not needed to `` interpret '' the results of observations .",
    "newton s theory also had the same role for an observer .",
    "it is a _ passive role _ for an observer .",
    "_ objective reality _ of physical phenomena , that the physical phenomena are independent of the act of observation by an observer , is then the underlying philosophical or conceptual basis of the universal theory of relativity . that the objective reality of physical phenomena can be established in a mathematically and physically consistent manner",
    "should now be evident .    in summary , the proposed generalization of the newtonian concept of force by that of a transformation of the standard borel space @xmath2395 has the `` genuine potential '' to provide us a physical theory of everything .",
    "this generalization provides us , essentially , a field theory that also contains a natural non - singular notion of the ( newtonian ) particle to represent physical bodies .",
    "moreover , measuring instruments and physical objects are then treatable at par with each other as a result of this generalization .",
    "this generalization is also in complete conformity with the general principle of relativity .",
    "a fundamental implication of the quantum conception is that of indeterminacy , heisenberg s indeterminacy .",
    "the proposed generalization of the concept of force leads us to a mathematical framework that explains indeterminacy as arising out of an intrinsic fuzziness of the concept of a particle vis -  - vis the field .    _",
    "the present formalism , of the dynamical systems of the underlying continuum @xmath2395 , is then , already , a unification of the ideas of the quantum theory and the general principle of relativity .",
    "_    surely , many details need to be worked out before we can test the proposed universal relativity .",
    "however , some general observations regarding experimental tests can also be reached at the present stage of our theoretical developments .",
    "it is to such general experimentally important observations that we now turn to .",
    "the proposed universal relativity rests on the replacement of the newtonian concept of force at a fundamental level with its `` natural '' generalization - a transformation ( borel automorphism ) of the underlying continuum ( the space @xmath2395 ) .",
    "it should , of course , be clear now that this replacement is that of the `` total force '' and not of its different , individual , components .",
    "another issue of special relevance to physical considerations is that of the physical construction of reference frames .",
    "then , in `` fixing '' a physical reference frame , we are restricting our attention to some specific @xmath1706-set of the space @xmath2395 and could be considering that it is unchanging .",
    "then , a subgroup of the full group of borel automorphisms of @xmath2395 keeping that reference frame always invariant is natural for us to consider .",
    "we could then be dealing with the quotient of the space @xmath2395 by the reference frame .",
    "however , there certainly exist borel automorphisms of @xmath2395 which affect the chosen @xmath1706-set .",
    "these borel automorphisms of this last type are precisely those which affect the physical construction of the chosen reference frame .",
    "now , any member automorphism of the aforementioned subgroup could have other invariant sets in addition to the @xmath1706-set of the reference frame .",
    "all these invariant sets of an automorphism have their hausdorff distance `` fixed '' and , hence , are stationary relative to each other . by our physical association , these invariant sets of the space @xmath2395 are the , basic or compound , physical objects which are at `` rest '' relative to each other",
    ".    considerations of such type lead us , evidently , to a description of the physical construction of a reference frame in its totality and to a description of motion of other objects relative to it .    for example , consider a point - object and its associated @xmath1706-set . let a borel automorphism of the underlying standard borel space @xmath2395 be such that it is measure preserving and ( its action ) leading to a change in the hausdorff distance of the point object from that of a reference set ( set @xmath11 ) which we take to be an invariant set of that automorphism .",
    "also , let there be another set ( set @xmath89 ) , invariant under the same automorphism , with respect to which the hausdorff distance to the chosen point - object is unchanging .",
    "( see figure [ fig : rotmot ] . )",
    "circular motion , width=192,height=192 ]    physically , this above situation could , as an example , represent `` revolution '' of the chosen point - object around the set @xmath89 that is at rest relative to the reference set @xmath11 .",
    "the borel automorphism in question describes the `` complete '' trajectory of the point object in this situation and , hence , `` encodes '' the _ entire information about all the forces _ that are needed to determine the trajectory of the same point object in theories using the notion of force .",
    "[ because we limit ourselves here to only a general discussion of physical issues arising in universal relativity , we shall not explicitly display the borel automorphism corresponding to the motion described above .",
    "however , from the group properties of the automorphisms of the standard borel space , it is easy to see that such an automorphism indeed exists . ]    clearly , this above is a consequence of the fact that the universal relativity has only the law of motion , the borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395 , that is also the `` cause '' of motion in it .",
    "hence , as a result of the above , if some observation is explainable in any theory using the concept of force then , the same is explained in universal relativity by treating the _ involved total force(s ) _ as corresponding transformation(s ) . in this way , universal theory of relativity incorporates theories that use the concept of force .",
    "essentially , a point object is a well - defined , non - singular , notion in the mathematical framework of universal relativity .",
    "if certain observation related to a physical body is `` explainable '' by representing the involved material body as a point particle whose motion is describable by assuming a total force ( equivalently , potential field ) then , in universal relativity , the same `` total force '' is a borel automorphism of the space @xmath2395 acting on the the @xmath1706-set of the imagined point particle .    of course , we can adopt this above procedure of `` realizing '' a borel automorphism of space @xmath2395 for only the cases which are `` explainable '' by theories using the concept of force .",
    "this then also means that there will be situations in universal relativity which will not be explainable by theories using the concept of force .",
    "as a consequence of the above , experimental situations can arise for which universal relativity can be tested in the laboratory .",
    "experimental tests of the universal theory of relativity will then have to be developed keeping in mind this above .",
    "specifically , we should then look for or devise experimental situations for which no `` natural '' explanations are offered by theories using the concept of force .",
    "in the direction of the inner solar system .",
    "notably , the anomaly exceeds by five orders of magnitude the corrections to newtonian motion predicted by einstein s theory of gravity .",
    "any modification of gravitation large enough to explain the anomaly is in contradiction with the planetary ephemerides by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , at the present moment , it can not be concluded with certainty that conventional effects do not cause the anomaly and new explanations are required .",
    "see , for example , d izzo and a rathke ( 2005 ) _",
    "options for a non - dedicated test of the pioneer anomaly _ , * database : astro - ph/0504634*. ]    one such possibility is provided by the torsion balance experiment that has been the basis of many important experimental results related to gravity @xcite . therefore , as an example of the situations that can arise in universal relativity , we discuss below the `` explanations '' for the outcomes of the torsion balance experiment .",
    "consider a torsion balance consisting of a thin wire , hanging from one end at the roof , to which a dumbbell is hanging from its exact middle at the other end of the wire .",
    "let the masses of the dumbbell be @xmath2470 and",
    "@xmath2471 , @xmath2472 .",
    "next , consider `` external '' masses @xmath2473 and @xmath2474 , @xmath2475 , attached to the ground , @xmath2473 placed on one side and @xmath2474 on another side of the dumbbell , with common center at the wire .",
    "torsion balance , width=192,height=192 ]    as per newton s theory , there are two possible situations in which _ no torque _ acts on the dumbbell of this assembly .",
    "the two such arrangements of the masses are : 1 ] the external masses and the dumbbell masses in one line and 2 ] line of the external masses being perpendicular to the dumbbell . then let the dumbbell be in its natural equilibrium position in one of these states .    in newton",
    "s theory , `` gravitational forces '' are supposed to act between the `` external '' masses and the masses of the dumbbell , and these forces `` cause '' the balance to `` torque '' when the `` external masses '' are _ shifted _ , say , from the situation 1 ] to the situation 2 ] .",
    "this holds irrespective of other `` couplings '' of the masses , but these couplings can nullify the `` gravitational '' torque . therefore , we then require and arrange that these other possible couplings have been suitably eliminated or minimized to adequate levels from the torsion balance assembly of the above type .    consequently , in newton s theory , the balance will always be set into `` oscillations '' when the positions of the external masses are alternated between situations 1 ] and 2 ] above , say , by rotating the external masses @xmath2473 and @xmath2474 about the common center with the dumbbell .    in universal relativity ,",
    "the balance setting into oscillations is `` explainable '' by treating the involved newtonian forces as corresponding transformations acting on the space @xmath2395 .",
    "but , as per universal relativity , we also have a transformation of the `` external masses '' from the situation 1 ] to the situation 2 ] _ without _ the balance ever getting torqued or set into oscillations .",
    "universal theory of relativity therefore predicts that a `` null outcome '' is permissible for the experiment of the above type .",
    "let us imagine a spherical shell whose outer surface is as `` frictionless '' as permissible .",
    "the torsion balance is situated `` inside '' the spherical shell while the `` external masses '' are situated outside the spherical shell .",
    "[ the reason why spherical shell is mentioned here is , evidently , due to its being an `` invariant '' of the rotation map .",
    "]    then , the motion of external masses can be such as to not affect the interior of the spherical shell and , hence , not affecting the state of the torsion balance located inside it .",
    "to see this above , let us first note that the torsion balance is a compound _ object _ , to be referred to as _ object 1 _ , in the sense described earlier .",
    "the external masses , together , are to be considered also a compound _ object _ , _ object 2_.    in our aforementioned experiment , we consider that the `` assembly '' of the torsion balance and the external masses is in one of the two `` no torque states '' above at the beginning of the experiment .",
    "let @xmath2476 be the ( initial ) transformation acting on the assembly of object 1 and object 2 , above , _",
    "ie _ , let the assembly be acted upon by an _ initial _",
    "borel automorphism @xmath2476 of the space @xmath2395 .",
    "the nature of the initial borel automorphism , although quite complicated , may be left unspecified in our present considerations .",
    "let @xmath2477 be the transformation of the rotational motion of only the external masses and leaving the torsion balance unaffected or the corresponding @xmath1706-sets invariant .",
    "that is , the map @xmath2478 acts on only the `` external masses or world '' to produce their rotational motion .",
    "the transformation acting on the assembly is then the mathematical composition @xmath2479 and its action is such that only the external masses or world external to balance revolve around the torsion balance with the @xmath1706-set of balance being an invariant set of the composition @xmath2479 .",
    "clearly , such a transformation is possible when the external masses are sufficiently away from the dumbbell masses so that the effects of rotational motion of the external masses take time to `` propagate '' to the dumbbell masses or when the dumbbell is _ well - shielded _ from _ all _ possible effects of the rotational motion of external masses .",
    "universal theory of relativity then `` guarantees '' that the torsion balance will _ not _ be torqued by the motion of the external masses in the experimental situation imagined above .",
    "evidently , no `` explicit calculations '' using transformations @xmath2476 and @xmath2478 are needed to reach this conclusion .",
    "universal relativity always predicts a `` complete null effect '' in this situation .    if , for the same experiment , we make the external masses move not along a circle but along an _ elliptical orbit _ , there is to be no change in the conclusion of universal relativity which predicts a _ complete null effect _ even in this latter situation .",
    "highly eccentric elliptic orbit for external masses would imply `` enhancement '' of the newtonian non - null effect .",
    "an elliptical orbit for the external masses could then be preferred over the circular orbit for obvious reasons .",
    "then , in certain situations , the effect on torsion balance is expected in universal relativity to be `` total null '' if shielding of the balance is proper .",
    "then , if the external masses `` rotate '' around the dumbbell masses sufficiently slowly , say , one revolution in few minutes , and if we run the experiment for a couple of weeks or months , so as to obtain good statistic , we can test the universal theory of relativity .",
    "of course , this test can only be considered successful if the `` null result '' is observed .",
    "else , in universal relativity , we shall be forced to conclude that the `` isolation '' of the torsion balance is not achieved .",
    "thus , if a torsion - balance experiment is sufficiently carefully performed in the aforementioned manner , we should be able to verify the possible `` null effect '' prediction of the universal theory of relativity against that of the `` certainly non - null effect '' of newton s theory .",
    "we then note that certain , extremely high precision , torsion balance experiments are in use .",
    "any of these torsion balance assemblies can then be employed to verify the `` null effect '' predicted by the universal theory of relativity .",
    "arthur schopenhauer : +      over the centuries , some fundamental concepts that led newton to his theory acquired the status of being self - evident .",
    "specifically , newton s concept of force is embedded so deep into our thinking that we treat it as a self - evident concept .",
    "no doubt , force is a very useful concept .",
    "but , while adopting this concept , we are certainly required to attribute to physical matter source properties that generate the forces in question .    however , we then choose to ignore one fundamental limitation of this conception that the source properties so attributed to physical matter can not find any explanations with the theory that uses the ( newtonian ) concept of force .",
    "developments in physics that took place over the times since newton formulated his mechanics were , explicitly or implicitly , based on the concept of force , developments in quantum theory not being any exceptional .",
    "[ the concept of potential energy is a `` byproduct '' of the newtonian concept of force . from the very beginning ,",
    "quantum theory `` assumed '' this conception of potential energy to formulate its various ( heisenberg ) operators . ]    except , perhaps , for hertz s attempt @xcite [ p. 31",
    "] when he felt the need to replace the concept of potential energy by some suitable other , no one attempted to generalize the concept of force ; such strong and gripping had been the influence of newton s thinking on the physicists .    in his attempts to incorporate the phenomenon of gravitation within the overall framework of the theory of relativity , einstein reached the equivalence principle and , for the first time , replaced the concept of force by that of the `` curvature '' of the spacetime geometry .",
    "although einstein replaced the concept of gravitational force by that of the curvature of spacetime geometry , his formulation of general theory of relativity did not live up to his intentions .",
    "the same conception did not work for other forces of nature , _ eg _",
    ", for coulomb s force . consequently , einstein s mathematical formulation of a theory ( of gravitation ) based on the principle of general relativity is logically completely inappropriate .",
    "einstein had `` realized '' such problems with his formulation of general relativity .",
    "that is perhaps why he dubbed his equations of general relativity as `` preliminary '' equations .",
    "this obvious `` failure '' led him to his numerous attempts at the unified field theory .",
    "even these attempts failed .",
    "many others following the methods of quantum theory systematically developed theoretical foundations for the successful description of the micro - physical world .",
    "for this purpose , definite but ad - hoc rules of obtaining the @xmath7-function were first adopted and the predictions checked by ingenious experimentations .",
    "however , einstein had , in his ways , also realized that these developments in quantum theory too were not entirely satisfactory from the perspective of some fundamental physical issues .",
    "he had , time and again , warned @xcite us against the pitfalls of the conceptions behind these theories - his own formulation of general relativity as well as the ( probabilistic ) quantum theory .    here , we systematically built on einstein s aforementioned intuition and replaced the newtonian concept of force with its natural generalization as a transformation of the underlying continuum .",
    "in doing so , we were led to a natural unification of the ideas of the quantum theory and those of the general principle of relativity .",
    "the formalism we developed satisfies one of the foremost of the requirements of a genuinely universal theory of physics : that the constants of physics `` arise '' in it through mutual relationships of physical objects and their values can not be changed without essentially destroying the underlying theoretical framework .",
    "it is also the universal theory of relativity that is in complete agreement with the general principle of relativity .    in the last section ,  [ results ]",
    ", we discussed an experimental test , the torsion balance test , of the proposed universal relativity . in accordance with the scientific methodology",
    ", it would then be worthwhile to let this and such tests decide whether the proposed generalization of the newtonian concept of force is really what is appropriate one to describe the workings of the physical world .",

    "<S> we therefore suggest that the existence of such _ anomalous null - results _ be searched for in torsion balance experiments , preferably involving dynamic measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> [ such anomalous null results will be some of the main features of the proposed universal theory of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> this is because a transformation of the underlying space providing null result for any given experimental situation is , thinkably , permissible . </S>",
