    "a full microscopic description of low - lying excitations in deformed nuclei has eluded theoretical studies to date . along with the interplay of collective and single - particle excitations , which takes place in deformed rare earth nuclei ,",
    "additional problems arise in the actinide region because of the reflection asymmetry @xcite .",
    "evidently the nature of the first excited 0@xmath3 states in the actinide nuclei is different from that in the rare earth region where they are due to the quadrupole vibration @xcite .",
    "octupole degrees of freedom have to be important in the actinides .",
    "one has then to expect a complicated picture at higher excitations : residual interactions could mix the one - phonon and multiphonon vibrations of quadrupole and octupole character with each other and with quasiparticle excitations .",
    "detailed experimental information on the properties of such excitations is needed for comparison with theory . on the experimental side ,",
    "the ( p , t ) reaction is very useful . on the theoretical side , a microscopic approach such as the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )",
    "is necessary , in order to account for the number of states detected and to make detailed predictions on their properties .",
    "our previous paper @xcite concentrated on the excited @xmath1 states in the actinide nuclei @xmath4th , @xmath0th and @xmath5u studied in the ( p , t ) reaction .",
    "this interest in the @xmath1 excitations in the deformed actinide nuclei was stimulated by the observation of multiple @xmath6 transfers in the ( p , t ) reaction leading to the excited states in the odd nucleus @xmath7pa @xcite as well as to the excited states in the medium heavy even nuclei @xmath8nd @xcite , @xmath8sm @xcite , @xmath9ba @xcite .",
    "after comprehensive information on 0@xmath3 excitations was obtained in the actinide nuclei @xcite , systematic studies of the same type were made on many nuclei between @xmath10gd and @xmath11hg @xcite and revealed a large number of excited 0@xmath3 states , whose nature is not yet understood .",
    "the ( p , t ) reaction , however , gives much more extensive information on specific excitations in these nuclei , which was not analyzed previously @xcite .",
    "an attempt to obtain such information was made for @xmath12er after using a high - resolution experimental study with the ( p , t ) reaction @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a careful and detailed analysis of the experimental data from the high - precision , high - resolution study of the @xmath5th(p , t)@xmath0th reaction carried out to get deeper insight into excitations in @xmath0th including the nature of the @xmath1 excitations .",
    "experimentally accessible thorium nuclei span a wide and interesting range of isotopes : from the semi - magic @xmath13th to quadrupole - deformed @xmath14th .",
    "an especially interesting region is that around a=228 , where the even isotopes @xmath15th , @xmath4th and @xmath0th are considered to be octupole - deformed , octupole soft and vibrational - like , respectively @xcite .",
    "two of them are accessible for study by the ( p , t ) reaction .",
    "besides @xmath1 excitations , whose number is increased in comparison with the preliminary analysis in publication @xcite , the spins for many other states are also assigned .",
    "the results concerning 0@xmath3 , 2@xmath3 and 4@xmath3 excitations are mainly discussed .",
    "the 6@xmath3 and negative parity states are excited weakly in the ( p , t ) reaction ; therefore information on these states is only fragmentary .",
    "the results of a similar analysis for @xmath4th in comparison with @xmath7pa as well as for @xmath5u will be presented in forthcoming papers @xcite .    in sec .",

    "the experimental data obtained in this study are compared with the results of calculations in microscopic approach of the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) .",
    "the validity of the phenomenological approach of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) is also tested to account for at least the main features of the positive parity excitations in @xmath0th , in addition to @xmath1 states tested in @xcite .",
    "a target of 100 @xmath16g/@xmath17 @xmath5th evaporated on a 22 @xmath16g/@xmath17 thick carbon backing was bombarded with 25 mev protons of an intensity of 1 - 2 @xmath16a from the tandem accelerator of the maier - leibnitz - labor of the ludwig - maximilians - universitt and technische universitt mnchen .",
    "the isotopic purity of the target was about 99% .",
    "the tritons were analyzed with the q3d magnetic spectrograph and then detected in a focal plane detector .",
    "the focal plane detector is a multiwire proportional chamber with readout of a cathode foil structure for position determination and de / e particle identification @xcite .",
    "the acceptance of the spectrograph was 11 msr , except for the most forward angle of 5@xmath18 with an acceptance of 6 msr .",
    "the resulting triton spectra have a resolution of 47 kev ( fwhm ) and are background free for all angles but 5@xmath18 for which background from light contaminations in the region of 1100 - 1150 kev complicated the analysis for some levels .",
    "the angular distributions of the cross sections were obtained from the triton spectra at ten laboratory angles from 5@xmath18 to 45@xmath18 .    a triton energy spectrum measured at a detection angle of 7.5@xmath18 is shown in fig .",

    "for the calibration of the energy scale the triton spectra from the reaction @xmath19w(p , t)@xmath20w , @xmath21w(p , t)@xmath19w and @xmath14u(p , t)@xmath5u were measured at the same magnetic settings . some known levels in @xmath0th",
    "were included in the calibration , leading to small corrections from 0 to 0.5 kev for excitations between 1.5 mev and 3.3 mev . in the course of our measurements we found that the q values for the ( p , t ) reactions on the @xmath5th , @xmath0th and @xmath14u targets or on the @xmath21w and @xmath19w targets are in disagreement with the ones calculated from the atomic mass evaluation @xcite depending which q value",

    "the q values for the @xmath21w(p , t ) and @xmath19w(p , t ) reactions differ considerably from the calculated one and vice versa , if the q value for the @xmath19w(p , t ) reactions is taken as the reference value . it is not clear from these data what is the reason for this discrepancy .",

    "<S> the excitation spectra in the deformed nucleus @xmath0th were studied by means of the ( p , t ) reaction , using the q3d spectrograph facility at the munich tandem accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distributions of tritons are measured for about 200 excitations seen in the triton spectra up to 3.3 mev . </S>",
    "<S> firm @xmath1 assignments are made for 16 excited states by comparison of experimental angular distributions with the calculated ones using the chuck code . </S>",
    "<S> additional assignments are possible : relatively firm for 4 states and tentative also for 4 states . assignments up to spin @xmath2 are made for other states . </S>",
    "<S> sequences of the states are selected which can be treated as rotational bands and as multiplets of excitations . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data are compared with interacting boson model ( ibm ) and quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) calculations . </S>"
