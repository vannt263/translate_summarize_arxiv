    "the spectral properties of quantum mechanical systems are closely related to the ones of their classical counterparts  @xcite . this relation can be made precise and quantitative in the semiclassical limit . in the extreme cases",
    "this correspondence is quite well understood , although some important details are subject of research  @xcite .",
    "the spectral statistics exhibit a high degree of universality , although there are exceptional systems that do not exhibit this universal behavior , due to some special properties .",
    "when a classical system is chaotic the statistical properties of corresponding quantum spectrum are well described by random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite with the symmetry determined by the underlying hamiltonian . for integrable systems , on the other hand , levels are typically uncorrelated resulting in poissonian spectral statistics  @xcite .",
    "there are however intermediate situations .",
    "one is of mixed systems , where in some parts of phase space the motion is chaotic and in other parts it is regular leading to different statistics  @xcite .",
    "another type of systems that exhibit intermediate statistics are systems with singularities , that are integrable in absence of these singularities .",
    "these are models of physical situations where an integrable system is strongly perturbed in a region much smaller then the wavelength of the quantum particle .",
    "examples of such systems are billiards with flux lines , sharp corners and @xmath2-like interactions  @xcite .",
    "the specific system that will be analyzed in the present work is a billiard with a @xmath2-like potential perturbation .",
    "the interest in billiards of various types is primarily theoretical since it is relatively easy to analyze them analytically and numerically .",
    "billiards were studied also experimentally for electrons  @xcite , microwaves  @xcite and for laser cooled atoms  @xcite .",
    "we hope that in the future , perturbations of the type discussed in the present work will be also introduced in the experimental realizations of billiards .",
    "semiclassical methods provide a convenient path to explore how classical dynamical properties affect the quantum spectral statistics .",
    "the connection between spectral statistics and classical dynamics is usually made using trace formulas which connect the quantum density of states to a sum over classical periodic orbits .",
    "for classically chaotic systems the trace formula was developed by gutzwiller  @xcite while for classically integrable systems the trace formula was developed by berry and tabor  @xcite .",
    "such formulas can be used to compute the energy level - level correlation function , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the level separation .",
    "its fourier transform is the spectral form factor @xmath0 , where the `` time '' @xmath8 is conjugate to @xmath7 . for systems with strong perturbations on length scales smaller than the wavelength ,",
    "standard semiclassical theory can not be used and diffraction effects have to be taken into account . for billiards with localized perturbations",
    "this can be done in the framework of the geometrical theory of diffraction ( gtd )  @xcite . in this approximation , scattering from the perturbation can be described by a free propagation to the perturbation multiplied by a diffraction constant , which depends on the incoming and outgoing directions , and then free propagation away from the perturbation .",
    "the spectral statistics of the rectangular billiard with a flux line was recently studied  @xcite . in this system",
    "the flux line affects the amplitudes of the contributions of periodic orbits .",
    "when the form factor is computed it is found that at small times @xmath8 it tends to a flux dependent constant ( instead of @xmath9 in absence of the flux ) .",
    "certain triangular billiards were shown to have similar behavior  @xcite .",
    "the works mentioned above are based only on the contributions from periodic orbits .",
    "it is of interest to include the contributions of orbits that are diffracted by the flux line in the spectral form factor .",
    "the contribution of diffracting orbits turns out to be rather complicated .",
    "the contribution of orbits with one diffraction was computed by sieber  @xcite , while bogomolny , pavloff and schmit computed the contributions of diffracting orbits with several forward diffractions to the density of states  @xcite .",
    "the effect of diffraction on the spectral statistics in these systems was not determined yet .",
    "the difficulty results from the need to know the contributions of orbits which diffract almost in the forward direction and to include all of these in the form factor , and this has not been done so far . since the diffraction from flux lines and corners is complicated it is of special interest to examine a system in which the diffraction is relatively simple .",
    "a class of such systems , that consists of integrable billiards with localized perturbations , is the subject of the present work . for systems of this type",
    "only diffraction effects are responsible for deviation of the behavior from the one of integrable systems , therefore these are most appropriate for the exploration of such effects .",
    "the diagonal approximation , where the cross terms between the contributions of classical orbits are ignored because of rapidly varying phases associated with them , is used for a large variety of systems .",
    "berry has shown that using the diagonal approximation leads to agreement with the form factor of random matrices , at small times  @xcite . only recently",
    "sieber and richter  @xcite were able to go beyond the diagonal approximation and to compute the next power of @xmath8 for chaotic systems with time reversal symmetry .",
    "this non diagonal contribution was found to originate from orbits with small angle self intersections and orbits which are close to them in coordinate space , except near the intersection .",
    "such configurations are not possible if there is no time reversal symmetry , thus this is an example where the difference in the spectral statistics is connected to a difference in the dynamical properties of the classical counterpart , and the difference can be obtained directly from a formula involving the classical periodic orbits . for chaotic systems with singular perturbations , where effects of diffraction are important , also the non diagonal contributions to the form factor @xmath0 are important .",
    "the final result , however , is that such perturbations do not affect the spectral statistics as is clear from the works of sieber  @xcite and of bogomolny , leboeuf and schmit  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of chaotic systems , addition of a localized scatterer , is expected to change qualitatively the spectral properties of integrable systems . moreover , for such systems",
    "the diagonal approximation is not sufficient to obtain any interesting physics and one should go beyond this approximation .",
    "non diagonal contributions can be calculated following a method that was developed by bogomolny  @xcite . by this method contributions of some manifolds consisting of orbits that are almost parallel are calculated .",
    "if a point interaction , that is a generalization of a @xmath2-function potential , is added to a rectangular billiard , one obtains the so called eba billiard  @xcite .",
    "the spectral statistics of this system were computed exactly , subject to the assumption that the underlying integrable system exhibits poissonian statistics  @xcite and it was shown not to be those of integrable or chaotic systems .",
    "the spectral statistics of the eba billiard with periodic boundary conditions were shown by berkolaiko , bogomolny and keating  @xcite to be identical to those of certain star graphs , where the form factor was calculated by berkolaiko and keating  @xcite .",
    "after the work was completed a paper by bogomolny and giraud  @xcite , where the expansion of @xmath0 , was calculated to all orders in @xmath8 was published on the web .",
    "it is more general than the present paper , but in our paper more of the physical properties are calculated and discussed in detail .",

    "in this section the form factor will be calculated for a rectangular billiard with a scatterer such that its diffraction constant @xmath3 , is angle independent .",
    "the form factor is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy levels correlation function : @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the mean level spacing of the system .",
    "the brackets denote averaging over an energy window which is large compared to the mean level spacing @xmath14 but small when compared to the semiclassical energy @xmath15 . in the semiclassical limit ,",
    "the oscillatory part of the density of states , @xmath16 , is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the complex conjugate and the sum is over periodic orbits . using this density of states ,",
    "the form factor is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the action of the orbit , @xmath21 is its period , and @xmath22 is assumed .",
    "the sum is over the leading semiclassical contributions to the density of states . for smooth potentials @xmath23",
    "is given by the berry - tabor formula for integrable systems  @xcite and by the gutzwiller trace formula for chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "in these formulas the sum is over the periodic orbits of the system . in the present work ,",
    "periodic orbits and diffracting orbits will be included in the sum .    due to the averaging only action differences that are of",
    "the order of @xmath24 or less can contribute to the form factor .",
    "as a result , the diagonal approximation can be used , where only pairs of orbits with the same action contribute .",
    "this approximation is valid for integrable systems  @xcite and thus also valid when there are only once diffracting orbits ( since their density is proportional to that of periodic orbits as will be explained in the following ) .",
    "when orbits with more than one diffraction are included this approximation is no longer valid and non diagonal terms should be included as is done in what follows .",
    "since the motion in the billiard is free , the periods of the orbits are related to the lengths by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the wavenumber ( the units @xmath27 , @xmath28 are used from now ) .",
    "the mean level spacing , in the semiclassical limit , is given by @xmath29 . in the diagonal approximation",
    "the form factor is expressed as a sum over orbits of identical lengths @xmath30 the averaging widens the delta function and enables to replace the sum over orbits by an integral using the density of orbits .",
    "every factor of length , @xmath31 , is replaced by a factor of @xmath32 , and as will be seen , every diffraction order eventually contributes a power of @xmath8 to the from factor .",
    "the form factor @xmath0 will be calculated to the third order in @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral statistics are very sensitive to the location of the scatterer , since they are influenced by degeneracies in the lengths of the diffracting orbits .",
    "therefore we choose to treat first the simplest case when the scatterer is in the center of the rectangle .",
    "then length degeneracies are maximal .",
    "later we treat the case in which the scatterer is at a typical location , such that its coordinates ( relative to the rectangle sides ) are typical irrational numbers .",
    "the periodic and diffracting orbits are classified by the number of bounces from the boundaries .",
    "we will denote by @xmath33 a periodic orbit with @xmath34 and @xmath35 bounces from the boundaries and by @xmath36 a diffracting orbit with @xmath37 and @xmath38 bounces from the boundary .",
    "when the scatterer is at the center of the rectangle the length of the diffracting segments is given by @xmath39 while the length of the periodic orbits is @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle .",
    "the contributions to the oscillatory part of the density of states were calculated in the framework of geometrical theory of diffraction in app .",
    "[ diffcont ] . for an angle independent",
    "scatterer the contributions  ( [ finaldos ] ) to @xmath23 can be simplified since @xmath43 reduces to a constant @xmath3 and if the scatterer is at the center the terms do not depend on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the contribution of them with no more than three diffractions is @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 we omitted the factors @xmath51 defined in  ( [ perioddosc ] ) since the fraction of orbits where these differ from unity is negligible in the calculations of the present section .",
    "examples of the various orbits contributing to ( [ dosc2]-[a2dif ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ orbitsfig ] .",
    "first the contribution of terms that involve no more than one diffraction , resulting from the first two terms in the expansion  ( [ dosc2 ] ) of @xmath23 , will be calculated .",
    "following  ( [ inangle ] ) the contributions of the diffracting terms can be classified according the parity of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "if both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are even ( even - even orbits ) the orbit @xmath52 coincides with a periodic orbit , since in the notation of  ( [ inangle ] ) , at the scatterer @xmath53 ( compare fig .",
    "[ orbitsfig ] a ) and b ) ) and the contribution of these orbits will be calculated first .",
    "there is no such relation for the other parities , ( even - odd , odd - even , odd - odd , referring to the parities of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and actually for such parities the diffracting orbits are halves of periodic orbits ( this is only true if the scatterer is at the center , therefore for example the orbit in fig .  [ orbitsfig ] c ) is not a half of a ( @xmath54 ) periodic orbit ) . for even - even diffracting orbits the first two sums in the expression  ( [ dosc2 ] ) can be grouped as @xmath55 where the first sum runs over periodic orbits while the second sum runs over diffracting orbits , omitting orbits where both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are even and @xmath56 the diagonal approximation is now applied to various terms in  ( [ 1difftod ] ) and the sum in  ( [ diagfactor ] ) is replaced by an integral with the density @xmath57 of orbits of length @xmath58 .",
    "this is the density of periodic orbits as well as the density of diffracting orbits with a given parity of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as can be easily seen from  ( [ lengthper ] ) and  ( [ lengthdif ] ) .",
    "the resulting contribution of the periodic and even - even diffracting orbits to the form factor is @xmath59 the contribution of the other diffracting orbits ( odd - odd , odd - even , even - odd ) with the amplitudes @xmath60 of  ( [ a1dif ] ) are @xmath61 and their combined contribution is @xmath62 thus , the contribution of the once - diffracting orbits and the periodic orbits to the form factor is @xmath63    from  ( [ apo]-[a2dif ] ) we note that the powers of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( the powers in  ( [ apo]-[a2dif ] ) combined with the increasing density of multiple diffracting orbits resulting from powers of  ( [ density ] ) ) increase with the powers of @xmath3 and by  ( [ nondiagfactor ] ) and  ( [ diagfactor ] ) these lead to increasing orders of @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested first in all contributions to the order @xmath5 .",
    "the additional terms that may contribute to this order result from non diagonal terms in  ( [ nondiagfactor ] ) where @xmath66 is a periodic orbit and @xmath67 is an orbit with two diffractions , namely terms of the form @xmath68 the contribution of such terms will be analyzed in the following .",
    "all other contributions are of higher order in @xmath8 .",
    "we turn to analyze the contribution of non diagonal terms involving periodic and twice diffracting orbits .",
    "these oscillate as @xmath69 that may be potentially fast .",
    "naively , one can guess that after smoothing , the contributions relevant to the form factor are those for which @xmath70 .",
    "however , it turns out that there are not enough orbits that satisfy this equality in order to compensate for the extra factor of @xmath71 due to the additional diffraction .",
    "the contribution comes from combinations of orbits for which the lengths are almost equal .",
    "such combinations survive since there are enough orbits for which the phase of the exponent is of the order of unity in the semiclassical limit .",
    "this is caused by the fact that these orbits have hidden saddle manifolds on which their action differences are slowly varying .",
    "these manifolds were identified by bogomolny  @xcite , and were used to compute the density - density correlation function and mean values of powers of green s functions for integrable systems .",
    "the diffraction problem discussed here has lengths ( or actions ) that are related to the length of the periodic orbits so that saddle manifolds exist .",
    "we use bogomolny s method to compute this contribution .",
    "it will be convenient to expand the length of the diffracting orbits around the length of orbits that satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "this expansion is given by @xmath72 the length difference in the exponent is @xmath73 the periodic orbit is not expanded because for each periodic orbit there will be a saddle manifold composed of different twice - diffracting orbits .",
    "the summation over the orbits in the manifold will be also combined with summation over all of the periodic orbits .",
    "equivalently , it is possible to fix any of the lengths , expand the other lengths , and to reach the same contribution to the form factor .",
    "the condition that the orbits are on the saddle manifold is that the length difference , @xmath74 , is stationary leading to : @xmath75 the orbits on the manifold are the _ integer _ solutions of this equation . since the aspect ratio of the rectangle is assumed to be a typical irrational number , such solutions can be found only if the orbits are related by @xmath76 this means that the orbits are repetitions of some simpler orbit , for example @xmath77 substituting this condition in  ( [ saddle1 ] ) leads to @xmath78 since the aspect ratio is a typical irrational number an integer solution can be found only if @xmath79 we are interested in the contribution that survives the energy averaging , required for contributions to the form factor",
    ". therefore we will consider the saddle manifold for which @xmath80 this condition states that the periodic orbit ( which will contribute ) is also proportional to @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 is satisfied .",
    "the contribution of the terms of this saddle manifold to the level - level correlation function @xmath6 is : @xmath84 the symbol @xmath85 denotes two terms similar to the first ones but with the opposite sign of @xmath7 .",
    "this is actually a sum over @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 that define the orbits @xmath66 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "the contributions with similar phases , that do not cancel each other , and therefore survive the averaging over energy involved in the calculation of the form factor are those that satisfy  ( [ cond1 ] ) and  ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "the sum will be calculated and then fourier transformed in order to obtain the corresponding contribution to the form factor .",
    "the dominant contributions are these in which the length difference @xmath74 is much smaller than unity .",
    "the configuration of these contribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ lengths ] .",
    "the two diffracting segments are almost parallel to the periodic orbit .",
    "such a configuration is allowed since the difference between any lattice points is also a lattice point , moreover , the conditions  ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) force the orbit to have this configuration .",
    "note that @xmath91 are the projections of the lengths of the diffracting segments on the direction of the periodic orbit ( to the leading order in @xmath92 ) . since they are almost parallel they are a good approximation to the lengths of the diffracting segments .    since the contributing orbits have the configuration of fig .",
    "[ lengths ] , the variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 are convenient coordinates .",
    "this choice also takes into account the conditions  ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "the length difference is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the length difference @xmath74 appears as a phase in an exponent multiplied by @xmath97 .",
    "thus only length differences which scale as @xmath98 can contribute to the correlation function .",
    "the lengths of orbits that will contribute to the form factor scale as @xmath97 and thus the corresponding values of @xmath94 are of the order of unity or less . since the sum is dominated by terms in which @xmath99 or less , the expansion ( [ ldif ] ) is justified .",
    "this expansion may break down when either @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "however , there is a minimal length for the diffracting orbits and such lengths do not occur in the sum .",
    "the correlation function is computed by replacing the sum over orbits by an integral over @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the slowly varying terms are replaced by their values on the saddle ( when @xmath102 ) and the phase is replaced by the leading term of  ( [ ldif ] ) . to transform the sum into an integral the density of contributions",
    "is needed . the configuration in fig .",
    "[ lengths ] is obtained when the plane is tiled with rectangles using reflections with respect to the hard walls . the scatterer is also reflected and its images form a lattice ( since there is a scatterer in the center of each rectangle ) .",
