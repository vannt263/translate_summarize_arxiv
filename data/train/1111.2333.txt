    "about a fifth of the stars departing from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) are expected to undergo a final thermal pulse during their post - agb evolution @xcite .",
    "when this happens , the pre - white dwarf is predicted to be temporarily reborn as a yellow giant in the so called `` born again agb '' scenario @xcite .",
    "the transition from the pre - white dwarf to the giant configuration is expected to be very rapid ; being of a few years in the very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) flavor @xcite and of the order of a century in the late thermal pulse ( ltp ) case . due to the short duration of these events , although 10% of post - agb stars are expected to undergo a vltp , they are extremely rare from an observational perspective . indeed , only two objects ( v605 aql and v4334 sgr ) have been identified as stars undergoing a vltp ( see ) , while a third has been identified with the ltp flavor of the scenario ( fg sge , see and references therein ) .",
    "although observationally rare , individual vltp stars are extremely valuable as they are key to understand the formation of c - rich h - deficient stars , such as [ wc]-cspne , pg1159 and rcrb ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) and the formation of h - deficient white dwarfs which comprise about @xmath0% of known white dwarfs . in addition , born again star events are a key test for our understanding of s - process during the thermal pulse phase of the agb ( and ) and also for understanding of reactive convective burning in the interior of stars @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate suggests that the birth rate of planetary nebulae in our galaxy is of about @xmath1 every year .",
    "if 10% of their central stars become vltp giants , then we should expect such events in our galaxy to take place at a rate of about one per decade . due to their high intrinsic brightnesses ( @xmath2 )",
    "these objects can be easily detected at large distances within our galaxy .",
    "hence , it should not be strange if some born again eruptions are waiting to be identified in old and new star surveys",
    ". this could be the case for the object nsv 11749 .",
    "after an excellent systematic study of all useful harvard plates , @xcite was able to reconstruct the outburst lightcurve of this star .",
    "the plates show that the object was fainter than @xmath3 on 1897.6 , became visible for the first time at @xmath4 on 1899.5 and reached maximum at @xmath5 on 1903.4",
    ". then it remained at about maximum brightness until 1907.6 when it started to decline , becoming undetectable after 1911.6 with four possible detections at @xmath6 some decades later .",
    "finally , during the declining phase , the star showed three sudden disappearances ( fainter than @xmath7 ) before finally fading into oblivion . in this letter",
    "we argue that nsv 11749 was a vltp event and explore for possible counterparts in iphas and 2mass catalogs .",
    "the lightcurve of nsv 11749 bears a strong resemblance with those of vltp - objects ( v4334 sgr and v605 aql ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvas_3_objetos ] nsv 11749 increased its brightness by more than 2.5 magnitudes in the first 2000 days of its eruption ( i.e. @xmath8/yr ) , stayed at a maximum brightness of @xmath9 for about 1000 days and then started to experience sudden dimmings ( of more than @xmath10 ) after finally disappearing from view @xmath11 yr after its eruption .",
    "these three sudden disappearances of the star are particularly worth noting as they are very similar to those observed in the born again stars ( ) .",
    "at least in the best studied born again star ( v4334 sgr , @xcite ) it is clear that these sudden dimmings are caused by carbon - dust ejection episodes similar to those observed in r coronae borealis stars ( rcrb stars ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvas_3_objetos ] we compare the lightcurve of nsv 11749 with those of the two known fast born again stars ( v4334 sgr and v605 aql ) .",
    "the three lightcurves share the same main features : namely , in a period of years they show an outburst stage , a steady stage at maximum brightness , a phase of rcrb - like declines and finally a complete disappearance from view .",
    "these similarities alone are a strong argument in favor of a similar explanation for all three stars , and thus for a born again ( vltp ) explanation of the lightcurve of nsv 11749 . however , quantitatively , there is a significant difference in the timescales of nsv 11749 and both v4334 sgr or v605 aql . in both v4334 sgr and v605",
    "aql the sequence of events happened at a faster pace , increasing more than 3.5@xmath12 during the first year .",
    "also v4334 sgr ( v605 aql ) disappeared from view much faster , only @xmath13 yr ( @xmath14 yr ) after the eruption .",
    "then , the main question is to know if some born again stars could evolve a few times slower than observed in v4334 sgr or v605 aql . stellar evolution models ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that , indeed , that is the case .",
    "lightcurves for the fast - vltp sequences of @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    according to stellar evolution models vltp eruption lightcurves and temperatures are dependent on the mass of the erupting star .",
    "then , a direct comparison of nsv 11749 lightcurve with those of the two known vltp objects ( v605 aql and v4334 sgr ) might be misleading .    in order to compare theoretical eruptions in vltp models with the observed lightcurve of nsv 11749",
    "it is necessary to construct theoretical @xmath15 and @xmath16 lightcurves . in the absence of bolometric corrections for h - deficient stars in the wide range of temperatures covered by vltp eruptions",
    ", we have relied on theoretical model atmospheres to predict the expected @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes of the stellar evolution models .",
    "stellar atmospheres have been computed within the assumption of plane parallel geometry and lte , including the opacities of all relevant major atoms ( although without molecules or dust ) .",
    "although plane parallel geometry is not justified at the very low surface gravities attained by the models some years after the eruption , it is reasonable during the first years of the eruption , i.e. before the development of the rcrb - stage in real stars .",
    "abundances in stellar atmosphere computations have been chosen to reflect those predicted by vltp models ( @xcite ) , but tests show that lightcurves would be very similar if we had choosen abundances like those observed in v4334 sgr .",
    "lightcurves computed with these model atmospheres and the stellar evolution sequences of @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvas_v_b ] . also shown is the effective temperatures predicted by the models during the eruption .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvas_v_b ] , our models predict different lightcurves depending on the mass of the remnant that undergoes the eruption .",
    "in particular note that after the fast initial rise , the lightcurves either stall or slightly diminish . after reaching a plateau for a few years",
    ", the theoretical lightcurves start to rise again as the sequences increase their luminosities without a strong change in temperature .",
    "however , this happens after the temperature falls below @xmath17 and then we expect rcrb - like events to develop .",
    "in fact , the three identified born again stars ( fg sgr , v605 aql and v4334 sgr ) have shown rcrb extinction episodes after the temperature fell below @xmath17 ( , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , synthetic lightcurves will not reflect the observed behavior from this point onwards .",
    "then , the intrinsic maximum brightness of fast - vltp sequences , after the fast rise in brightness , spans a wide range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 both in v and b bands .",
    "+    in order to understand to which extent our lightcurves can be trusted when comparing with real stars , we now compare our lightcurves with those of the two bonafide vltp objects , v605 aql and v4334 sgr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v4334sgr_v605aql ] we compare the lightcurve of our best fit model lightcurve ( 0.542@xmath20 ) with the visual lightcurve of v4334 sgr ( @xcite , @xcite ) and with the photographic lightcurve of v605 aql published by .",
    "to compare @xmath15 and @xmath21 magnitudes , we adopt @xmath22 as in @xcite .",
    "the similarities between the predicted and observed lightcurves are apparent .",
    "it is worth noting that no tuning of the theoretical models has been carried out in order to fit the observed lightcurves .",
    "[ fig : v4334sgr_v605aql ] just displays our sequence with the most similar aspect with the observed ones .",
    "assuming the interstellar extinction model of @xcite , we find for v4334 sgr ( @xmath23 , for our most similar lightcurve ) a distance of @xmath24 kpc and @xmath25 .",
    "interestingly enough , this value is within the recommended values by , @xmath26 kpc , on the basis of several independent distance determinations .",
    "thus our 0.542@xmath20  lightcurve not only predicts a correct lightcurve shape for v4334 sgr but also a correct absolute magnitude . also , at the distance of @xmath24 kpc , and a derived value of @xmath27 our model also predicts the maximum brightness in the @xmath15 band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : v4334sgr_v605aql ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : v4334sgr_v605aql ] that our model is not able to predict simultaneously the correct luminosity and temperature evolution ( although its cooling speed , @xmath28 , is very similar to that of v4334 sgr ) .",
    "also the 0.542@xmath20  pre - outburst location in the hr diagram might be at variance with a possible pre - discovery detection of v4334 sgr s progenitor in 1976 ( see @xcite ) .    for the case of v605 aql ( @xmath29 , for our most similar lightcurve )",
    "we obtain a distance of @xmath30 kpc ( and @xmath31 , assuming @xmath32 ) , a value significantly lower than derived in previous works ; 2.7 kpc@xmath336.0 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , it has to be kept in mind that larger distances would have been obtained if the extinction is not as high as suggested by @xcite in that particular direction of the sky ( @xmath34 ) .    from these comparisons",
    "we conclude that our theoretical lightcurve shapes are very similar to those observed in real born again stars and can be used to identify born again star candidates .",
    "we notice , however , that theoretical models are not able to fit , simultaneously , all observed features .",
    "this is most probably due to the uncertainties in the treatment of the violent reactive convective burning of h in the models , something that it is still badly understood @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsv11749 ] we compare b - lightcurves of our 0.561 , 0.564 and 0.584@xmath20  sequences with the photographic lightcurve reconstructed by @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the theoretical lightcurves account for the brightening speed observed in nsv 11749 of about @xmath35 magnitudes per year .",
    "also , our lightcurves predict that the star will stay at maximum brightness for a few years .",
    "more interesting nsv 11749 has shown three sudden extinctions between 1907 and 1910 before disappearing from harvard plates in 1912 .",
    "these extinctions occur when our sequence shows a temperature @xmath36 and thus when real born again stars have shown us that rcrb - like extinction events are expected to occur .",
    "thus , our sequences not only reproduce the eruption lightcurve but also agree with the interpretation of the three drops in brightness observed in nsv 11749 as being caused by rcrb - like events . then",
    ", our models show that while nsv 11749 has increased its brightness by a factor about 2 to 4 slower than v4334 sgr or v605 aql , its lightcurve is well within the expected behavior for vltp eruptions of different masses . comparing the absolute magnitudes of the theoretical models with those observed in nsv 11749 , @xmath37 for our 0.564@xmath20  sequence",
    ", we roughly estimate a distance of @xmath38 kpc and @xmath39 . had we compared with our 0.561@xmath20  ( 0.584@xmath20 ) sequence , for which @xmath40 ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we would have estimated a distance of @xmath42 kpc ( @xmath43 kpc ) and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it must be noted that these distance estimates are very uncertain as they not only depend on the accuracy of born again models but also distances could be much larger if @xmath46 is overestimated by @xcite .",
    "prompted by the strong resemblance of nsv 11749 with born again lightcurves ( real and theoretical ) we looked into 2mass @xcite and iphas @xcite catalogs for possible counterparts .",
    "if nsv 11749 experienced a born again event @xmath47100 yr ago we would expect it to be , by now , either enshrouded in a thick dust shell similar to post - agb stars or reheating as a new central star of a planetary nebulae ( as seen in v605 aql ) . in order to constrain our search for present counterparts",
    "coordinates for nsv 11749 have been redetermined by the digital access to a sky century at harvard ( dasch , @xcite ) team from 6 plates from the harvard college university plate archive .",
    "these plates were scanned and analized with the dasch photometry pipeline , which yielded coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath49 with a rms error of @xmath50 .",
    "their photometry was also consistent with that presented by @xcite .",
    "only one infrared source ( from now on irs ) very near to the location of nsv 11749 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , is within @xmath53 from the derived coordinates .",
    "the irs is included in both 2mass and iphas catalogs with magnitudes @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( 2mass ) and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( iphas ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colores ] , 2mass colors for the irs are consistent with those of symbiotic stars , t - tauri stars , cataclismic variables , post - agb stars and pne . also , dereddened colors ( @xcite , assuming @xmath60 kpc ) fall very close to main sequence stars . fortunately , iphas colors for nsv 11749 fall above the cut defined by to isolate emision line objects ( zone 2 , see fig",
    ". 1 of ) and we can discard a main sequence star . also , iphas colors fall in a region of the color - color diagram populated by symbiotic stars , t - tauri stars and pne but away from post - agb stars ( the irs has higher @xmath61 brightness ) . note , however , that despite the similar iphas and 2mass colors , a fu ori ( i.e. t - tauri ) or symbiotic nova ( i.e. symbiotic star ) explanation for nsv 11749 is unlikely ( see next section ) . in fig . [",
    "fig : colores ] we also compare the 2mass colors of the irs with those derived for v4334 sgr and v605 aql dereddened assuming recomended distances of @xmath62 kpc and @xmath63 kpc respectively .",
    "as it is apparent , 2mass colors for the three objects are very different .",
    "the irs is bluer than dust enshrouded symbiotic stars ( sy_d ) and dust enshrouded vltp objects .",
    "thus , 2mass colors suggest that the irs is not strongly enshrouded by dust . also the irs is much brighter than the present state of v605 aql , which is suspected to be completely hidden behind a thick dust torus @xcite but similar to the brightness of v4334 sgr before the beginning of dust extinction events ( @xmath64 , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , an old pn would be expectable within the born again scenario , as all previous born again objects ( fg sge , v605 aql and v4334 sgr ) show such pne .",
    "inspection of ukst and iphas images around nsv 11749 do not reveal any pn around the eruption .",
    "however , as the formation of a pn depends on the evolutionary speed of its central star , the absence of a pn could be just the consequence of a different mass of the erupting star ( as already suggested by its lightcurve ) .",
    "finally , note that , material ejected during the eruption ( assuming 100 km / s as in v605 aql , @xcite ) would be smaller than 1 \" and , thus , not resolved . if nsv 11749 was a vltp , the progenitor star had to be different from those of v605 aql and v4334 sgr as the object does not seem to be now surrounded by a pn or enshrouded in a thick dust shell .",
    "based on its photometric lightcurve , williams suggested two possible scenarios to explain nsv 11749 , either a slow nova or a fu ori type star . in particular a fu ori event would be consistent with the 2mass colors of the irs that show it similar to t - tauri stars .",
    "however as already mentioned by @xcite these scenarios are unable to account both the brigthness increase and dimming .",
    "while slow novae decline in timescales of the order of a year @xcite in qualitative agreement with nsv 11749 , their rising is much faster increasing more than 5 magnitudes in a few days .",
    "the opposite happens with the fu ori scenario .",
    "while typical fu ori stars increase their brightness in a period of the order of a year their dimming is extremely slow , declining only a few magnitudes in decades .",
    "then both scenarios fail to mach the observed behavior of nsv 11749 with both rising and dimming taking place in timescales of years .",
    "a third alternative scenario suggested by the slow rising lightcurve is that of a symbiotic nova ( also known as very slow novas , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "symbiotic novae are thermonuclear novae that take place in symbiotic binary systems that would allow a natural link with the irs identified in the previous section .",
    "the eruption period of these objects can last from month to years , thus naturally accounting for nsv 11749 observed eruption lightcurve . however",
    "the decline of these eruptions is extremely slow lasting for decades and even centuries ( e.g. pu vul ) .",
    "thus , as in the case of the two previous scenarios , no simultaneous agreement with the eruption and declining timescales can be achieved .",
    "clearly , the born again scenario outperforms all other proposed explanations for nsv 11749 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in sect .",
    "2 , the qualitative agreement between the lightcurves of nsv 11749 and known vltp objects is very good .",
    "the most significant quantitative difference is that nsv 11749 eruption was a few times ( @xmath65 times ) slower with the rising taking place in about 5 years .",
    "however , we have shown in previous sections that these differences are expectable from differences in the mass of the star and , even better , that nsv 11749 lightcurve can be quantitatively reproduced by vltp models .",
    "in fact , differences in mass of the star could be related with the absence of a pn around the eruption .    with the aid of synthetic born again lightcurves we have presented strong arguments in favour of a vltp explanation for nsv 11749 .",
    "if this is so , nsv 11749 has some differences with both v4334 sgr and v605 aql ( no pn , probably not enshrouded by dust ) .",
    "this finding will strongly increase our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "in particular it will boost our understanding of the formation of h - deficient stars and of the reactive - convective burning phases of stellar evolution .",
