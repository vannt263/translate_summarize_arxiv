    "the formation process of low- to intermediate - mass stars is divided into several stages , ranging from the deeply embedded protostellar stage to the period when a young star is dispersing its protoplanetary disk in which planets may have formed . during the protostellar phase , which is estimated to last @xmath1 0.5 myr @xcite , the growing central source accretes dust and gas from a collapsing envelope .",
    "the material from the envelope is most likely accreted through a disk , feeding the growing star .",
    "a fraction of the mass is ejected in outflows , which carve openings into the envelope along the outflow axis . despite our understanding of the basic processes operating in low - mass protostars ,",
    "fundamental questions remain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , it is not understood how the processes of infall , feedback from outflows , disk accretion , as well as the surrounding birth environment , affect mass accretion and determine the ultimate stellar mass .",
    "the luminosity of protostars , which can be dominated by accretion , is observed to span more than three orders of magnitude , yet the underlying physics of this luminosity range is also not understood @xcite .",
    "it is in this protostellar phase that disks are formed , setting the stage for planet formation , yet how infall , feedback , accretion , and environment influence the properties of disks and of planets that eventually form from them is unknown .",
    "the large samples of well - characterized protostars identified from surveys with _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ now provide the means to systematically study the processes controlling the formation of stars and disks ; the goal of this work is to provide such a characterization for the protostars found in the orion a and b clouds , the largest population of protostars for any of the molecular clouds within 500 pc of the sun @xcite .    in protostars , dust in the disk and envelope reprocesses the shorter - wavelength radiation emitted by the central protostar and the accretion shock on the stellar surface and reemits it prominently at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths . as a result , the combined emission of most protostellar systems ( consisting of protostar , disk , and envelope ) peaks in the far - ir .",
    "young , deeply embedded protostars have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with steeply rising slopes in the infrared , peaking around 100 , and large fractional submillimeter luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "near 10  and 18 , absorption by sub - micron - sized silicate grains causes broad absorption features ; in addition , there are several ice absorption features across the infrared spectral range @xcite .",
    "these absorption features are indicative of the amount of material along the line of sight , with the deepest features found for the most embedded objects .",
    "in addition , due to the asymmetric radiation field , the orientation of a protostellar system to the line of sight , whether through a dense disk or a low - density cavity , plays a role in the appearance of the sed .",
    "it influences the near- to far - ir slope , the depth of the silicate feature , the emission peak , and the fraction of light emitted at the longest wavelengths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to classify young stellar objects ( ysos ) into observational classes , the near- to mid - infrared spectral index @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) from about 2 to 20 @xmath0 m has traditionally been used @xcite .",
    "this index is positive for a class 0/i protostar , between @xmath4 and 0.3 for a flat - spectrum source , and between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a class ii pre - main - sequence star .",
    "class 0 protostars are distinguished from class i protostars as having @xmath7 ratios larger than 0.5% , according to the original definition by @xcite .",
    "other values for this threshold that have recently been used are 1% @xcite and even 3% @xcite .",
    "another measure for the evolution of a young star is the bolometric temperature ( @xmath8 ) , which is the temperature of a blackbody with the same flux - weighted mean frequency as the observed sed @xcite . a class 0 protostar has @xmath9 k , a class i protostar 70 k @xmath10 650 k , and a class ii pre - main - sequence star 650 k @xmath10 2800 k @xcite .",
    "these observational classes are inferred to reflect evolutionary stages , with the inclination angle to the line of sight being the major source of uncertainty in translating classes to `` stages '' @xcite .",
    "also the accretion history , which likely includes episodic accretion events and thus temporary increases in luminosity , adds to this uncertainty @xcite .",
    "protostars with infalling envelopes of gas and dust correspond to stages 0 and i , with the transition from stage 0 to i occurring when the stellar mass becomes larger than the envelope mass @xcite .",
    "young stars that have dispersed their envelopes and are surrounded by circumstellar disks correspond to stage ii .    by modeling the seds of protostars , properties of their envelopes , and to some extent of their disks ,",
    "can be constrained .",
    "the near - ir is particularly sensitive to extinction and thus constrains the inclination angle and cavity opening angle , as well as the envelope density .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy reveals the detailed emission around the silicate absorption feature and thus provides additional constraints for both disk and envelope properties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "envelope emission starts to dominate .",
    "thus , photometry in the far - ir is necessary to determine the peak of the sed and constrain the total luminosity and envelope properties .",
    "here we present 1.2870 @xmath0 m seds and radiative transfer model fits of 330 ysos , most of them protostars , in the orion star formation complex .",
    "this is the largest sample of protostars studied in a single , nearby star - forming region ( distance of 420 pc ; @xcite ) and therefore significant for advancing our understanding of protostellar structure and evolution .",

    "we use a grid of 30,400 protostellar model seds to find the best fit to the sed for each object and constrain its protostellar properties . as mentioned above , the far - infrared data add crucial constraints for the model fits , given that for most protostars the sed peaks in this wavelength region , and therefore , within the framework of the model grid , our sed fits yield the most reliable protostellar parameters to date for these sources .",

    "in addition , after the pacs data were obtained , several new point sources that were very faint or undetected in the _ spitzer _ bands were discovered in the _ herschel _ data @xcite .",

    "thus , the emission at far - ir and sub - mm wavelengths is expected to be dominated by the protostar or pre - main - sequence star , and we can assume that the seds are representative of the ysos even if the nearby sources can not be separated at these wavelengths .",
    "there are a few ysos that have objects separated by just 1 - 3  and are only resolved in one or two irac bands ( hops 22 , 78 , 108 , 184 , 203 , 247 , 293 , 364 ) ; in these cases we used the flux at the irac position that most closely matched those at longer wavelengths .",
    "we note that some of these very close `` companions '' are likely outflow knots .",
    "there are also unresolved binaries , which appear as single sources even in the irac observations @xcite ; in these cases our seds show the combined flux in all wave bands . if two point sources are not fully resolved and the resulting blended source is elongated , no irac photometry was extracted . in such cases ,",

    "they might be due to calibration or extraction problems in the irs spectrum ( for example , some extended emission around the target or a close companion ) , but also to variability .",
    "we assumed the former scenario if the flux deviations between irs and irac and between irs and mips were similar ( and more than 10% , a conservative estimate for the typical calibration uncertainty ) , and in such cases scaled the irs spectrum to the mips 24  flux .",

    "should be common , but we also expect some protostars with large mismatches .    one protostar with a large discrepancy between various data sets is hops 223 .",
    "it is an outbursting protostar ( also known as v2775 ori ; @xcite ) , and for its sed we had 2mass , irac , and mips data from the pre - outburst phase available , while the irs spectrum , pacs , and apex data are from the post - outburst period .",

    "for measuring the near- to mid - ir sed slope ( @xmath17 ) , we chose a spectral index between 4.5 and 24 @xmath0 m to minimize the effect of extinction on the short - wavelength data point ; also , the irac 4.5 @xmath0 m fluxes for our hops targets are more complete than the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m fluxes due to the lower extinction at this wavelength . for calculating @xmath16 and @xmath8 , we used all available fluxes for each object , including the irs spectrum , assumed a distance of 420 pc , and used trapezoidal summation ; for @xmath8 , we applied the equation from @xcite .",

    "the values for the various model parameters are listed in table [ modelpars ] . since there are a large number of parameters that can be set in the whitney radiative transfer models , we focused on varying those parameters that affect the sed the most , leaving the other parameters at some typical values .",
    "for example , we assumed a stellar mass of 0.5 @xmath42 , a disk mass of 0.05 @xmath42 , and an envelope outer radius of 10,000 au .",
    "the stellar mass enters the code in two ways .",
    "first , it is needed to relate the density of the envelope to the infall rate ( see equation 1 below ) .",
    "since we fit the density of the envelope , the infall rate plays no role in the best - fit envelope parameters ; any stellar mass can be chosen to determine the infall rate for a given best - fit envelope density .",
    "second , the stellar mass is combined with the stellar radius and disk accretion rate to set the disk accretion luminosity . given that the accretion luminosity is the actual parameter that influences the sed , it does not matter which of the three factors is varied . for simplicity and reasons described below",
    ", we varied the disk accretion rate and the stellar radius , but left the stellar mass constant , to achieve different values for this component of the luminosity .",
    "the total luminosity for each system consists of the stellar luminosity ( derived from a 4000 k stellar atmosphere model ) , the accretion luminosity resulting from material accreting through the disk down to the disk truncation radius , and the accretion luminosity from the hot spots on the stellar surface , where the accretion columns , which start at the magnetospheric truncation radius , land ( these columns are not included in the modeled density distribution , since they do not contain dust and do not have a source of opacity in the radiative transfer models ) .",
    "typically , the accretion luminosity from the hot spots is much larger than the disk accretion luminosity ; in our models , the former is about a factor of 9 larger than the latter .",
    "we chose three different stellar radii , 0.67 , 2.09 , and 6.61 @xmath43  ( with the same stellar temperature ) , resulting in three different stellar luminosities .",
    "since both components of the accretion luminosity depend on the disk accretion rate , choosing a total of eight different disk accretion rates ( three for the 0.67 @xmath43   star , two for the 2.09 @xmath43  star , and three for the 6.61 @xmath43  star ) results in eight values for the total luminosity used in the grid ( see table [ modelpars ] ) . the input spectrum produced by the central protostar depends on the relative contributions from the intrinsic stellar luminosity ( which peaks at 0.7  @xmath0 m ) and the accretion luminosity ( which is radiated primarily in the uv ) . in the models",
    ", it can be altered to some degree by choosing different combinations of the disk accretion rate and stellar radius ( the former affects only the accretion luminosity , while the latter affects both the stellar and accretion luminosity ) .",
    "however , the effect of the input spectrum on the output sed is negligible .",
    "consequently , we can not reliably measure the relative contributions of stellar and accretion luminosity through our sed fits .",
    "instead , we adjusted the particular values for the stellar radius and disk accretion rate to set the values of the total luminosity .    for our model grid , we chose four values for the disk outer radius , which we set equal to the centrifugal radius ( @xmath44 ) . in a tsc model ,",
    "the centrifugal radius is the position in the disk where material falling in from the envelope accumulates ; due to envelope rotation , material from the envelope s equatorial plane lands at @xmath44 , while material from higher latitudes falls closer to the star .",

    "thus , one could scale a particular model by a factor between @xmath1 0.5 and 2 and get a good representation of a protostar that is somewhat fainter or brighter , without having to rerun the model calculation with the different input luminosity .",
    "the model fluxes are computed for 24 different apertures , ranging from 420 to 10,080 au in steps of 420 au ( which corresponds to 1  at the assumed distance of 420 pc to the orion star - forming complex ) . for these sed fluxes , no convolution with a psf",
    "is done , and therefore the spatial distribution of the flux is solely due to the extended nature of protostars .",
    "since the envelope outer radius is chosen to be 10,000 au , the largest aperture encompasses the entire flux emitted by each protostellar system .",
    "however , most of the near- and mid - infrared emission comes from smaller spatial scales , so an aperture of about 5000 au will already capture most of the flux emitted at these wavelengths .    for a more accurate comparison of observed and model fluxes , in each infrared photometric band where we have data available , we interpolate model fluxes from the two apertures that bracket the aperture used in measuring the observed fluxes ( 4  for 2mass , 24 for irac , psf photometry for mips 24 , with a typical fwhm of 6 , 96 for pacs 70 and 100 , 128 for pacs 160 ) . for the irs data points , we use fluxes interpolated for a 53 aperture , since the spectra",
    "are composed of two segments , sl ( 5.2 - 14 ; slit width of 36 ) and ll ( 14 - 38 , slit width of 105 ) , and , if any flux mismatches were present , the sl segment was typically scaled to match the ll flux level at 14   ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the fluxes corrected for these psf losses are very similar to the sed fluxes , typically within @xmath1 5 - 10% at apertures larger than 5 .",
    "since our observed fluxes correspond to these psf - corrected fluxes ( we apply aperture corrections to our fluxes measured in a 128 aperture to account for psf losses ) , adopting the sed fluxes from the largest aperture would yield model fluxes that are somewhat too high .",

    "we often used psf photometry to minimize contamination from nearby sources and nebulosity ; however , psf fitting was not used for more isolated sources since the envelopes can be marginally resolved at 160 @xmath0 m and thus deviate slightly from the adopted psf shape .    , but for the laboca ( 870 @xmath0 m ) fluxes .",

    "in order to determine which aperture radius corresponds best to beam fluxes , we created a similar set of model images as above at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m , convolved them with gaussian psfs , and measured fluxes in the model images using different apertures ( see figures [ model_fluxes_saboca ] and [ model_fluxes_laboca ] , where we show the results for one model ) .",
    "fluxes measured in the convolved model image are smaller than the sed fluxes , especially at aperture radii smaller than the fwhm of the beam .",
    "we find that the beam fluxes for saboca and laboca are best matched by sed fluxes from apertures with radii half the size of the fwhm of the beam , i.e. , 365 for saboca and 95 for laboca ( thus , the aperture sizes are the same as the beam fwhm ) .",
    "this is again an idealized situation , since the measured saboca and laboca beam fluxes also include extended emission ( if the source lies on top of background emission ) , and thus they could be higher than those from the model .          in our models ,",

    "we calculated a small number of models with and without external heating and then compared their far - infrared and submillimeter fluxes .",
    "one set of models has @xmath82=0.1 @xmath19 , @xmath44=100 au , @xmath76=15 , and four different reference densities @xmath68 , ranging from 2.4 @xmath73 g @xmath33 to 2.4 @xmath70 g @xmath33 .",
    "the other set has the same parameters except for @xmath82 , which is 1.0 @xmath19 .",
    "we calculated models without external heating , with heating from an isrf equal to that in the solar neighborhood , and with isrf heating 10 times the solar neighborhood value .",
    "for these models , we did not include any foreground extinction for the isrf ; thus , the isrf heating in these models can be considered an upper limit  especially the 10-fold increase over the isrf in the solar neighborhood represents an extreme value .",
    "figure [ models_ext_heat ] shows a few examples of model seds with and without external heating .",
    "external heating results in flux increases in the far - ir and sub - mm ; as expected , it affects low - luminosity sources more , and its effects are also more noticeable for higher - density envelopes .    for a more quantitative comparison of model fluxes in the far - ir and sub - mm , we computed the fluxes for each model in six different bands , those of mips 24 @xmath0 m , pacs 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath0 m , and saboca ( 350 @xmath0 m ) and laboca ( 870 @xmath0 m ) , using apertures as described in section [ model_ap ] .",
    "the model fluxes are affected by poorer signal - to - noise ratios at the longest wavelengths , so the 870 @xmath0 m fluxes are less reliable .",
    "we subtracted the fluxes of the models without external heating ( @xmath120 ) from those with external heating ( @xmath121 ) to determine the flux excess due to external heating .",
    "the ratios of these excess fluxes and the model fluxes with external heating ( @xmath122 ) are shown in figure [ models_ext_heat_ratios ] .",
    "given that these ratios depend on the inclination angle to the line of sight , we show them as average values for all 10 inclination angles as well as the range subtended by all inclination angles .",
    "we note overall smaller flux ratios at 350 @xmath0 m due to the smaller aperture size chosen in this wave band ( see section [ model_ap ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that heating by the isrf results in flux increases in the far - ir and sub - mm that are about a factor of 2 - 3 higher for envelopes of low - luminosity sources ( @xmath82=0.1 @xmath19 ) than for those with higher luminosity .",
    "also , the effect of external heating is more noticeable at longer wavelengths ( where apertures / beams are also larger ) than at shorter ones ; given our chosen apertures , the largest effect occurs at 160 and 870 @xmath0 m .",
    "we also note that the flux increases due to heating by the isrf are smallest for the lowest @xmath68 value probed , 2.4 @xmath70 g @xmath33 ; at 160 @xmath0 m , the flux increase is largest for intermediate envelope densities .",
    "finally , the flux increases in the far - ir and sub - mm are far larger for a solar - neighborhood isrf scaled by factor of 10 than for an unscaled isrf ; for the @xmath82=0.1 @xmath19  models , an unscaled isrf increases the fluxes from a few percent ( at @xmath119 100 @xmath0 m ) to 50% ( at 870 @xmath0 m ) , while an isrf scaled by a factor of 10 increases these fluxes by 30%-75% .",
    "thus , for low - luminosity protostars , up to @xmath1 75% of a protostar s 870 @xmath0 m flux could be due to external heating , if the environment is dominated by an extremely strong isrf .    to estimate how the contribution of external heating would modify derived model parameters , in figures [ ext_heat_sed1 ] and [ ext_heat_sed2 ] we compare model seds that include external heating by an isrf 10 times stronger than in the solar neighborhood and model seds without this additional heating . for the latter , we used models from our model grid and tried to reproduce the seds with external heating . for the models with @xmath82=0.1 @xmath19",
    ", the effect of external heating can be reproduced by increasing the luminosity by factors of a few , increasing @xmath68 by up to an order of magnitude , and increasing the cavity opening angle and inclination angle by a small amount . for the @xmath82=1.0 @xmath19  models , just increasing the reference density by a factor of 2.5 results in a good match to the long - wavelength emission of our externally heated models ; however , the shorter - wavelength flux is either under- or overestimated .",
    "a better match is achieved with models having the same reference density as the externally heated models , but with slightly larger cavity opening angles and inclination angles , and luminosities about a factor of 2 larger .",
    "thus , if the far - ir and sub - mm fluxes were contaminated by emission resulting from extremely strong external heating , a model fit using models from our grid ( which does not include external heating ) could overestimate the envelope density by up to an order of magnitude and the luminosity by a factor of 2 - 5 .",
    "the cavity opening and inclination angles would also be more uncertain , but not by much . for",
    "a more realistic scenario with more modest external heating ( which would also include the effect of local extinction ) , the effect on model parameters would be smaller .",

    "[ models_ext_heat_av ] ]    for the latter point , we explored the effect of extinction on the isrf by calculating a few more models with @xmath82=0.1 @xmath19 , @xmath44=100 au , @xmath76=15 , @xmath125 g @xmath33 , an isrf 10 times stronger than that in the solar neighborhood , and @xmath126 values for the isrf of 2.5 , 10 , 20 , and 50 .",
    "the model seds are shown in figure [ models_ext_heat_av ] .",
    "compared to isrf heating without any foreground extinction , already @xmath127 causes a decrease by a factor of 1.5 - 2 in the overall emission at far - ir wavelengths . with @xmath126 of 10 and 20 , the far - ir emission decreases by factors of up to @xmath1 3.5 and 4 , respectively , compared to a strong isrf that is not extinguished .",
    "the fraction of excess emission due to external heating at 160 @xmath0 m decreases from an average of 0.8 for @xmath126=0 ( see figure [ models_ext_heat_ratios ] ) to 0.6 , 0.3 , and 0.2 for @xmath126=2.5 , 10 , and 20 , respectively .",
    "therefore , considering that typical @xmath126 values in orion are @xmath1 10 - 20 mag @xcite , it is likely that the effect of external heating on model parameters of low - luminosity sources does not exceed a factor of @xmath1 2 in luminosity and @xmath1 5 in envelope density .",
    "a customized fitting routine determines the best - fit model from the grid for each object in our sample of 330 ysos ( see sections [ sample ] and [ seds ] ) using both photometry and , where available , irs spectroscopy .",

    "objects have some _ spitzer _ photometry and a measured flux value in the pacs 70 @xmath0 m band .",
    "no additional data from the literature were included in the fits to keep them homogeneous .    in order to reduce the number of data points contained in the irs spectral wavelength range ( such that the spectrum does not dominate over the photometry ) and to exclude ice absorption features in the 5 - 8  region and at 15.2 that are usually observed , but not included in the model opacities , we rebin each irs spectrum to fluxes at 16 wavelengths .",
    "these data points trace the continuum emission and the 10 and 20  silicate features .",
    "also , when rebinning the spectrum , we smooth over its noisy regions , and we scale the whole spectrum to match the mips 24  flux if a similar deviation is also seen at the irac 5.8 and 8  bands and is larger than 10% . figure [ irs_rebin ] shows three examples of our irs spectra with the rebinned fluxes overplotted .",
    "our selection of 16 irs data points in addition to at most 13 photometric points spread from 1.1 to 870  puts more emphasis on the mid - ir spectral region in the fits .",
    "this wavelength region is better sampled by observations , most of the emission is thermal radiation from the protostellar envelope and disk ( as opposed to some possible inclusion of scattered light or thermal emission from surrounding material at shorter and longer wavelengths , respectively ) , and it contains the 10  silicate feature , which crucially constrains the sed fits . as a result , most models are expected to reproduce the mid - ir fluxes well and might fit more poorly in the near - ir and sub - mm .    ]    to directly compare observed and model fluxes , we create model seds with data points that correspond to those obtained from observations , from both photometry and irs spectroscopy . for the former ,",
    "the model fluxes are not only derived from the same apertures as the data ( see section [ model_ap ] ) , but also integrated over the various filter bandpasses , thus yielding model photometry . for the latter",
    ", the model fluxes are interpolated at the same 16 wavelength values as the irs spectra .",
    "since the model grid contains a limited number of values for the total luminosity ( eight ) , but the objects we intend to fit have luminosities that likely do not correspond precisely to these values , we include scaling factors for the luminosity when determining the best - fit model .",
    "as long as these scaling factors are not far from unity , they are expected to yield seds that are very similar to those obtained from models using the scaled luminosity value as one of the input parameters .",
    "the scaling factor can also be related to the distance of the source ; for all model fluxes , a distance of 420 pc is assumed , but in reality the protostars in our sample span a certain ( presumably small ) range of distances along the line of sight . for example , a 10% change in distance would result in a @xmath1 20% change in flux values ( scaling factors of 0.83 or 1.23 ) . here",
    "we report luminosities assuming a distance of 420 pc .",
    "in addition to scaling factors , each model sed can be extinguished to account for interstellar extinction along the line of sight .",
    "we use two foreground extinction laws from @xcite that were derived for star - forming regions : one applies to @xmath128 ( or @xmath129 ) , and the other one to @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 ) . for @xmath132",
    ", we use a spline fit to the mathis @xmath133 curve @xcite .",
    "since the three laws apply to different extinction environments , we use a linear combination of them to achieve a smooth change in the extinction law from the diffuse interstellar medium to the dense regions within molecular clouds .",
    "thus , to find a best - fit model for a certain observed sed , the model fluxes @xmath134 are scaled and extinguished as follows : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath134 are the observed and model fluxes , respectively , @xmath137 is the luminosity scaling factor , and @xmath138 is the extinction at wavelength @xmath139 .",
    "we use three reddening laws , @xmath140 ; by denoting them with the subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 , @xmath138 in the above equation becomes @xmath141 thus , equation [ f_scaled_ext ] can be written as @xmath142 these are linear equations in @xmath143 , with the left - hand side of the equations as the dependent variables and @xmath144 as the independent variable .",
    "for each regime of @xmath143 values , a best - fit line can be determined that yields @xmath143 and @xmath145 from the slope and intercept , respectively , for each model that is compared to the observations .    for each set of model fluxes and observed fluxes , we calculate three linear fits ( using linear combinations of the three different extinction laws , as explained above ) , thus yielding three values for scaling factors and three for the extinction value .",
    "if each extinction value is within the bounds of the extinction law that was used and smaller than a certain maximum @xmath143 value ( which will be discussed below ) , and the scaling factor is in the range from 0.5 to 2.0 , then the result with the best linear fit will be used .",
    "however , if some of the values are not within their boundaries , then combinations of their limiting values are explored , and the set of scaling factor and extinction with the best fit is adopted .",
    "for example , if a model has fluxes that are much higher than all observed fluxes , the linear fit described above will likely yield very large extinction values and small scaling factors . in this case",
    "the fitter would only accept the smallest possible scaling factor ( 0.5 ) and the maximum allowed @xmath143 value as a solution ( which will still result in a poor fit ) .    for each object",

    "we converted the total hydrogen column density from these maps to @xmath126 values ( @xmath126=3.55 @xmath143 ) by using a conversion factor of @xmath147 @xmath148 mag@xmath54 @xcite . for objects for which no column density could be derived",
    ", we set the maximum @xmath143 value to 8.45 ( which corresponds to @xmath149 ) .    after returning a best - fit scaling factor and extinction value for each model , each data point",

    "thus , @xmath154 is a measure of the average , weighted , logarithmic deviation between the observed and model sed .",

    "also , a statistic that measures deviations between models and data in log space more closely resembles the assessment done by eye when comparing models and observed seds in log(@xmath156 ) vs.  @xmath139 plots .",
    "we set the weights @xmath151 to the inverse of the estimated fractional uncertainty of each data point ; so , for photometry at wavelengths below 3  they are equal to 1/0.1 , between 3 and 60  they are 1/0.05 , at 70 and 100  they are 1/0.04 , at 160  the weight is 1/0.07 , and for photometry at 350 and 870  they are 1/0.4 and 1/0.2 , respectively . for fluxes from irs spectra the weights are 1/0.075 for wavelength ranges 8 - 12  and 18 - 38 , while they are 1/0.1 for the 5 - 8   and 12 - 18  regions .",
    "these irs weights are also multiplied by 1.5 for high signal - to - noise spectra and by 0.5 for noisy spectra . in this way those parts of the irs spectrum that most constrain the sed , the 10  silicate absorption feature and slope beyond 18 @xmath0 m , are given more weight ; for high - quality spectra , the weights in these wavelength regions are the same as for the 3 - 60  photometry .    for small values",

    "when examining objects @xmath154 values between 2.0 and 4.0 , there are 51 class 0 protostars ( 55% of class 0 protostars in the sample ) , 91 class i protostars ( 73% of the class i sample ) , and 74 flat - spectrum sources ( 73% of the flat - spectrum sample ) .",
    "thus , close to 90% of flat - spectrum sources are fit reasonably well ( @xmath154 values @xmath29 4 ) , representing the largest fraction among the different classes of objects in our sample .",
    "this could be a result of their source properties being well represented in our model grid , but also lack of substantial wavelength - dependent variability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which , if present , would make their seds more difficult to fit .",
    "about three - quarters of class i protostars also have best - fit models with @xmath159 ; this fraction drops to about two - thirds for the class 0 protostars .",
    "the latter group of objects often suffers from more uncertain seds due to weak emission at shorter wavelengths ( which , e.g. , results in a noisy irs spectrum ) ; they might also be more embedded in extended emission , such as filaments , which can contaminate the far - ir to submillimeter fluxes .",
    "another factor that could contribute to poor fits is their presumably high envelope density , which places them closer to the limit in parameter space probed by the model grid .",
    "overall , 75% of the best - fit models of the protostars in our sample have @xmath159 .",
    "when examining the sed fits of objects with @xmath154 values larger than 5.0 , several have very noisy irs spectra ( hops 19 , 38 , 40 , 95 , 164 , 278 , 316 , 322 , 335 , 359 ) . in a few cases the measured pacs 100 and 160 @xmath0 m fluxes seem too high compared to the best - fit model ( e.g. , hops 189 ) , which could be an indication of contamination by extended emission surrounding the protostar .    of particular interest",
    "are objects where variability likely plays a role in a poor fit . as mentioned in section [ seds ] , variability among protostars",
    "is common ; we found in appendix [ variability ] that about 5% of our targets display noticeable ( @xmath160 50% ) mismatches between the irs , irac , and mips fluxes that could be due to intrinsic variability .",
    "the sed fits of objects for which the flux mismatches between irs and irac and between irs and mips are different are particularly affected , since in that case we did not scale the irs spectrum to match the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "hops 228 exemplifies such a case : there is a clear discrepancy between the irac and irs fluxes ( a factor of 2.1 - 2.7 ) and also between mips 24 @xmath0 m and irs ( a factor of 0.8 ) ; even though the fit gives more weight to the irs data , they are not fit well , especially the silicate absorption feature .",
    "the @xmath154 value of 5.74 for the fit of hops 228 reflects the discrepant data sets and poor fit .",
    "hops 223 is another case where the irs fluxes do not match the shorter - wavelength data ( they are more than an order of magnitude larger ) ; however , it is a known fu ori source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sed presented here contains both pre- and post - outburst data .",
    "the model fit is very poor , which can also be gauged by the @xmath154 value of 8.41 .",
    "there are also objects with overall good fits whose seds show discrepancies that may be signs of variability or contamination .",
    "for example , for the class i protostar hops 71 the irac fluxes are a factor of 1.8 - 2.4 lower than the irs fluxes in the 5 - 8 @xmath0 m region , and also the mips flux is about 20% lower .",
    "the best - fit model ( @xmath161 ) fits the sed extremely well beyond about 6 @xmath0 m , with some discrepancy at shorter wavelengths .",
    "there is a source just 11  from hops 71 that is detected in 2mass and _ spitzer _ data , but not by pacs ; this object , hops 72 , is likely an extragalactic object ( see appendix [ exgal_not_modeled ] ) that could contaminate the irs fluxes .",
    "thus , in this case , wavelength - dependent contamination by a companion could explain the discrepancies observed in the sed .",
    "another example is hops 124 , which is a deeply embedded class 0 protostar .",
    "for this object , the mismatch between irs and irac and mips fluxes decreases with increasing wavelength ( from a factor of 2.5 to a factor of 1.4 ) ; for the sed fit , the irs spectrum was scaled by 0.7 to match the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "as with hops 71 , there is a nearby source that could contaminate some of the fluxes , especially at shorter wavelengths : hops 125 , a flat - spectrum source , lies 9.8  from hops 124 and is brighter than hops 124 out to @xmath1 20 @xmath0 m , but then much fainter at longer wavelengths .",
    "the best - fit model of hops 124 ( @xmath162 ) matches the mid- to far - ir photometry and also most of the irs spectrum well .    as an example of a probably variable flat - spectrum source , hops 132 has irac fluxes that lie a factor of 1.3 - 1.7 above those of irs and a mips 24 @xmath0 m flux that is a factor of 0.6 lower .",
    "it does not have a close companion ; the nearest hops source , hops 133 , is 27  away .",
    "the irs spectrum was not scaled , and since the sed fitter gave more weight to the spectrum , it is fit well , but the irac photometry is underestimated and the mips photometry overestimated .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath154 value of the best fit is 2.87 .",
    "overall , the sed fits of objects that are likely variable or suffer from some contamination are less reliable , but it is not always clear from the @xmath154 value of the best fit .",
    "the sed fitting procedures assume that the protostars are not variable , so when large mismatches between different data sets are present , the fit will appear discrepant with at least some of the observed data points , but the @xmath154 value would not end up particularly high if , e.g. , the irs spectrum was fit exceptionally well .",
    "however , given the data sets we have for these protostars , our sed fits will still yield the best possible estimate for the protostellar parameters describing these systems .",
    "the histogram of best - fit @xmath68 values ( which is the density of the envelope at 1000 au ; see section [ model_parameters ] ) is shown in figure [ rho1000_histo ] .",
    "the median value of the distribution amounts to @xmath163 g @xmath33 ; this corresponds to a @xmath89 value of @xmath164 g @xmath33 .",
    "there is a spread in values : 69 objects have densities @xmath68 smaller than @xmath165 g @xmath33 ( 6 of them have actually no envelope ) , 89 fall in the @xmath166 to @xmath167 g @xmath33 range , 96 are between @xmath167 and @xmath168 g @xmath33 , 60 between @xmath168 and @xmath169 g @xmath33 , and 16 have @xmath68 values larger than @xmath170 g @xmath33 .     of the best fits for the 330 targets in our sample .",
    "[ rho1000_histo ] ]    ]    we also calculated the envelope mass ( @xmath171 ) within 2500 au for the best - fit models ( see figure [ menv_histo ] for their distribution ) . the 2500 au radius is close to half the fwhm of the pacs 160 @xmath0 m beam at the distance of orion ( i.e. , @xmath1 6 ) , and thus roughly represents the spatial extent over which we measure the seds .",
    "this envelope mass is determined from the integrated envelope density of our best - fit models , with allowances made for outflow cavities , and thus only valid in the context of our models .",
    "the median envelope mass within 2500 au amounts to 0.029 @xmath42 .",
    "the majority of protostars have model - derived masses in the inner 2500 au of their envelopes around 0.1  @xmath42 ; just 22 objects have @xmath171 ( @xmath29 2500 au ) larger than 1.0  @xmath42 . of the 330 modeled objects ,",
    "291 have @xmath171 ( @xmath29 2500",

    "the median total luminosity amounts to 3.02 @xmath19 , while the values cover four orders of magnitude , from 0.06 @xmath19  ( for hops 336 ) to 607 @xmath19  ( for hops 288 and 361 ) .",
    "since the minimum and maximum values for the total luminosity in our grid amount to 0.1 and 303.5 @xmath19 , respectively , and our scaling factors range from 0.5 to 2.0 , our fitting procedure can return best - fit luminosities that range from 0.05 to 607 @xmath19 .",
    "thus , two protostars are reaching the upper limit allowed for total luminosities in our grid ; it is possible that even better fits could be achieved by increasing the luminosity further .    from the distribution of best - fit outer disk radii in figure [ rdisk_histo ]",
    ", it is apparent that most protostars are fit by small disks whose radius is only 5 au . since the outer disk outer radius is the centrifugal radius in our models , infalling material from the envelope tends to accumulate close to the star for most sources .",
    "thus , the disk radius is tied to the envelope structure ; a small centrifugal radius implies higher envelope densities at smaller radii and a less flattened envelope structure .",
    "the median disk radius is 50 au , but the number of objects with disk radii @xmath11 50 au is roughly evenly split among the values of 50 , 100 , and 500 au .    the distribution of best - fit cavity opening angles is displayed in figure [ cav_histo ] .",
    "most protostars seem to have either very small ( 5 ) or very large ( 45 ) cavities ; the median value is 25 . when dividing the envelope densities by cavity opening angle ( see figure [ pars_cav_histo ] , left column ) , differences emerge : the distributions of @xmath68 values are significantly different when comparing objects with @xmath76=5  and @xmath17235 , objects with @xmath76=15  and @xmath76 @xmath11 25 , and objects with @xmath76=25  and @xmath76=45 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests yield significance levels that these subsamples are drawn from the same parent population of @xmath119 0.015 .",
    "thus , there seems to be a difference in the distribution of envelope densities among the best - fit models with smaller cavity opening angles and those with larger cavities .",
    "protostars with larger cavities ( @xmath11 35 ) tend to have higher envelope densities ( their median @xmath68 values are about an order of magnitude larger compared to objects with cavities @xmath157 15 ) .",
    "figure [ pars_cav_histo ] ( middle column ) also shows the distribution of total luminosities for the different cavity opening angles .",
    "the only significant difference can be found for the @xmath76=5  histogram as compared to the histograms for larger @xmath76 values ( k - s test significance level @xmath119 0.03 ) ; the luminosities of models with @xmath76=5  have a different distribution , and also their median value is 1.45 @xmath19 , as compared to @xmath1 3 - 5 @xmath19  for the models with larger cavities .",
    "so , protostars with small cavities seem to have lower total luminosities .    ]",
    "the distribution of centrifugal radii for different cavity opening angles ( right column in figure [ pars_cav_histo ] ) shows that , independent of cavity size , most objects have @xmath49 = 5 au .",
    "however , the distribution among the four different disk radii becomes flatter for the largest cavity opening angles ; the histograms for @xmath76=35   and @xmath76=45  are very similar ( k - s test significance level of 0.98 ) .",
    "there is also no significant difference ( k - s test values @xmath26 0.075 ) between the @xmath76=15  and @xmath76=25  histograms and between the @xmath76=5  and @xmath173 35  histograms .",
    "the distributions of disk radii for the other cavity opening angles are all different from one another ( k - s test significance levels @xmath29 0.015 ) .",
    "overall , figure [ pars_cav_histo ] shows that protostars best fit by models with large cavity opening angles are also fit by models with higher envelope densities and larger centrifugal radii .    ]    in figure [ inc_histo ] , we show the distribution of the inclination angles for the best - fit models .",
    "there is a clear concentration of models in the 60@xmath17470  range ; the median inclination angle is 63 .",
    "this median value is close to 60 , which is where the probability for isotropically distributed inclination angles reaches 50% ( i.e. , the probability of observing an inclination angle less than 60  is the same as the probability of observing i@xmath2660 ) .",
    "however , the details of the distributions differ .",
    "the cumulative probability of finding an inclination angle less than a certain value , @xmath175 , is @xmath176 , assuming a random distribution of inclination angles . for inclination angles @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the probability for @xmath179 is @xmath180 .",
    "thus , since the inclination angles in our model grid were chosen to be equally spaced in @xmath41 ( there are five values @xmath2960  and five values @xmath2660 ) , one would expect a flat distribution in figure [ inc_histo ] if the best - fit inclination angles were randomly distributed ( see the green dashed histogram ) .",
    "however , we find a distribution peaked at 63  and 70 .",
    "this can also be seen in figure [ inc_cdf ] , where we compare our observed cumulative distribution of inclination angles to that of randomly distributed ones .",
    "our distribution shows a deficit at inclination angles below 60  and is just slightly higher at large inclination angles .",
    "a k - s test of the two distributions yields a 5.6% chance that they are drawn from the same parent distribution .                 to examine",
    "whether the distribution of envelope parameters changes with inclination angle ( which could imply a degeneracy ) , figure [ pars_inc_histo ] shows the reference envelope density @xmath68 , the total luminosity , and the cavity opening angle binned by three ranges of inclination angles .",
    "none of the three model parameters show a significantly different distribution for any of the inclination bins ( k - s test significance levels are @xmath160 0.1 , except for the cavity opening angles for the lowest and middle inclination range , for which the k - s test significance value is 0.02 ) .",
    "the median @xmath68 values for the @xmath1811841 , 4963 , and 6987  inclination bins are all @xmath163 g @xmath33 . even though not shown in figure [ pars_inc_histo ] , the objects whose best - fit model does not include an envelope",
    "are only found at @xmath182 49 .",
    "it is noteworthy that protostars with the highest envelope densities do not have inclination angles in the 6987  range ; it is not clear whether this is an observational bias , whether our observed sample does not contain high - density , edge - on protostars , or whether this is due to biases in the fitting procedure and/or model grid .",
    "the median values for the total luminosity do not differ by much for the different bins of inclination angle , increasing from 2.9 to 4.1 @xmath19  from the lowest to the middle inclination range and then decreasing to 2.0 @xmath19for the highest inclination angles .",
    "the few protostars with very high @xmath82 values have large inclination angles ( @xmath182 49 ) . finally , the distribution of cavity opening angles is quite similar for different ranges in inclination , except for a somewhat larger number of @xmath183 45values at intermediate inclination angles .",
    "half the objects in the @xmath1811841   and 6987  inclination bins have @xmath184 15  ( with the most common value 5 ) , while almost half the objects at intermediate inclination angles have @xmath173 35  ( the most common value is 45 ) .    in figure",
    "[ ltot_lbol ] , we show ratios of the total and bolometric luminosities as a function of inclination angle and foreground extinction ( @xmath84 and @xmath126 are adopted from the best model fits ) .",
    "the total luminosity is the intrinsic luminosity from the best - fit model of each object , while the bolometric luminosity is derived by integrating the fluxes of the observed sed .",
    "it is expected that @xmath82 is higher than @xmath16 for objects seen at higher inclination angles , since for these objects a large fraction of the emitted flux is not directed toward the observer ( and thus deriving bolometric luminosities from observed fluxes will underestimate the intrinsic source luminosity ) .",
    "conversely , objects seen more face - on should have lower @xmath82 values compared to @xmath16 .",
    "our data and model fits yield @xmath82 values that are usually higher than the @xmath16 values measured from the sed ; the discrepancy is larger for the more highly inclined sources .",

    "the fact that @xmath186 even for @xmath1811841  could be related to the typically smaller cavity opening angles for this range of inclination angles ( see figure [ pars_inc_histo ] ) ; less flux , especially at shorter wavelengths , is detected since the opacity along the line of sight is still high due to the small cavities .",
    "foreground extinction also plays a role in increasing the @xmath82/@xmath16 ratio .",
    "the median ratio of these luminosities increases from 1.8 for the @xmath126= 0 - 5 mag range to 5.0 for @xmath126=25 - 30 ; it decreases somewhat for the next @xmath126 bin , but reaches 5.9 at @xmath126=40 - 50 ( the 23 objects with @xmath187 50 , not shown in figure [ ltot_lbol ] , have a median @xmath82/@xmath16 ratio of 8.2 ) . among the 22 objects with best - fit @xmath126 values of 0 - 5 mag and inclination angles @xmath157 50",

    "flat - spectrum sources show the strongest near - ir emission of the three protostellar classes ; their median sed is very flat out to 70 @xmath0 m , but at longer wavelengths it is very similar in shape and flux level to that of class i protostars .              given that the @xmath154 values are a measure of the goodness of fit in units of the fractional uncertainty , we can use models that lie within a certain range of the best - fit @xmath154 value to estimate uncertainties for the various model parameters .",
    "for each modeled hops target , we tabulated the model parameters for all those models that lie within a difference of 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 of the best - fit @xmath154 .",
    "we then computed the mode ( i.e. , the value with the highest frequency ) for the inclination angle , total luminosity , @xmath68 , cavity opening angle , outer disk radius , and @xmath126 in each of the @xmath193 bins for each object . for",
    "any given protostar , the models in each @xmath193 bin span certain ranges in parameter values ; while the modes do not capture the full extent of these ranges , they convey the most common value within each parameter range .",
    "the farther away a mode is from the best - fit value , the more poorly constrained the model parameter .",
    "conversely , if a mode of a certain parameter is close to or matches the best - fit value , especially for @xmath194 1.5 or 2 , that particular model parameter is well constrained . in figures [ inc_modes ] to [ av_modes ]",
    "we plot the mode versus the best - fit value for six model parameters and four @xmath193 bins for all 330 targets in our sample .",
    "the larger @xmath193 , the larger the spread in modes is expected to be for each parameter value .    for example , figure [ inc_modes ] shows that even when considering all models with an @xmath154 value of up to 2 larger than the best - fit @xmath154 ( @xmath194 2 ) , the inclination angle for objects with a best - fit @xmath84 of 18  is well constrained ; most modes lie at @xmath181 18 , too , and only a few modes can be found at larger inclination angles .",
    "however , objects with best - fit @xmath84 values of 32  or 41  typically can also be fit by models with lower inclination angles ( the majority of modes lies below the line where mode and best - fit value are equal ) .",
    "inclination angles @xmath160 63  are better constrained , since their modes mostly lie at high inclination angle values , but there are protostars with modes of @xmath18118 , too .",
    "the modes for the total luminosity ( figure [ lum_modes ] ) show a small spread for models within @xmath193=0.5 , but the spread increases as @xmath154 increases , with some objects displaying up to an order of magnitude in variation of @xmath82 . as illustrated in figure [ rho1000_modes ] ,",
    "the reference density @xmath68 is usually well constrained ; however , as @xmath154 increases , the modes of the @xmath68 values are often lower than the best - fit values . for the cavity opening angle ( figure [ cavity_modes ] ) , many models up to @xmath193=2 have modes of @xmath76=45 , independent of the best - fit value .",
    "similarly for the centrifugal radius ( figure [ rdisk_modes ] ) , @xmath49=500 au is a common mode .",
    "for all four disk radii , the modes tend to be larger than the best - fit values ; in particular , objects with a best - fit @xmath49 of 5 au have a very uncertain disk radius .",
    "in general , it looks like our models do not constrain the disk radius and cavity opening angle well . the foreground extinction ( figure [ av_modes ] ) displays a certain range of modes for each best - fit value , but objects with @xmath195 20 typically have more reliable @xmath126 values from their model fits .",
    "figures [ inc_modes ] to [ av_modes ] allow us to gauge general trends between best - fit values and modes for different model parameters . for results on individual objects , we refer to appendix [ models_unc ] , where we show plots of the difference between the modes and the best - fit values of the major model parameters for all modeled hops targets .",
    "in this way it is possible to estimate which models are better constrained and thus which objects have more reliable sed fits . in addition , in appendix [ models_unc ] we also include contour plots of @xmath154 values for different pairs of model parameters for a few targets to illustrate typical parameter degeneracies , which also contribute to parameter uncertainties .",
    "we compared a grid of tsc models to each target by ranking the models using a statistic , @xmath154 , which measures the deviation between observed and model fluxes in logarithmic space .",
    "we did not model each source by further adjusting the model parameters , but instead identified the best - fit sed from our model grid .",
    "thus , we are bound by the range and sampling of parameters chosen for the grid , and while we constructed the grid with the aim of covering the typical parameter space for protostars , it is limited to discrete values .",
    "it is likely that many protostars have best - fit parameters that would fall between those sampled by the grid , and a few objects could have parameter values that lie beyond the limits set by the grid .",
    "in addition , tsc models are axisymmetric and have mostly smooth density and temperature profiles , and they do not include external heating .",
    "they assume a rotating , infalling envelope with constant infall rate and with the gravitational force dominated by the central protostar , but the true envelope structure is likely more complex .",
    "the models would not apply to the collapse of a cloud in an initial filamentary or sheet - like geometry or to multiple systems with , e.g. , more than one outflow cavity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the relatively simple models that we use , many of the observed seds are fit remarkably well : 75% of the fits have @xmath196 .",
    "in those cases , the continuum traced by the irs spectrum , the silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m , and the pacs fluxes are all accurately reproduced by the model .",
    "even many flat - spectrum sources , which often do not display any spectral features in the mid - infrared and have an overall flat sed out to 30 or 70 @xmath0 m , often have models that fit them very well . about 75% of class i protostars and @xmath1 70% of class",
    "0 protostars have @xmath159 , while close to 90% of flat - spectrum sources have @xmath154 values in this range .",
    "this validates the choice of parameter values for our model grid .",
    "additional constraints , like limits on foreground extinction or information on the inclination and cavity opening angles from scattered light images or mapping of outflows , would allow us to further test and refine the models . we have used limits on the extinction in our analysis . although _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ scattered light images have been used to constrain models for one hops protostar @xcite , scattered light images are not available for many of our targets .",
    "we therefore chose to focus on fitting the seds of all of our targets in a uniform way to a well - defined set of models .",
    "future studies will incorporate scattered light images and compare the results to those from the sed fits ( j. booker et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "the best - fit models from our grid for the hops targets both reproduce the seds and yield estimates for their protostellar parameters , mostly envelope properties . however , these are not necessarily unique fits to the data for three reasons",
    ". first , there are degeneracies in the model parameters ; increasing the envelope density or inclination angle , or decreasing the cavity opening angle or disk radius , results in a steeper mid - ir sed slope and deeper silicate features .",
    "each of these parameters affects the sed differently ( just the general trends are the same ) , and the best fit for each object tries optimizing them .",
    "the next best fit , however , could be a different combination of these parameters , especially if the sed is not well constrained by observations ( see section [ deltar ] ) .",
    "second , although the tsc models reproduce the observed seds , other models with different envelope geometries may also be able to fit the same seds .",
    "the modeling presented here is only valid in the context of the tsc models of single stars , and the resulting derived properties are only valid within that framework .",
    "last , neglecting external heating could result in overestimated envelope densities and luminosities , with the most noticeable effects ( @xmath68 and @xmath82 too large by factors of a few ) on low - luminosity sources exposed to strong radiation fields ( see section [ model_ext_heat ] ) . from the distribution of best - fit @xmath82 values",
    ", we estimate that @xmath1 20% of hops targets in our sample could be affected by external heating . even though we do not know the strength of external heating for each protostar , it is likely that external heating would only result in relatively small changes in the derived envelope parameters for these protostars .",
    "when comparing envelope parameters sorted by sed classes , we found that envelope densities and inclination angles decrease from the sample of class 0 protostars through that of class i protostars to that of flat - spectrum objects .",
    "the former is likely an evolutionary effect , while the latter confirms the results of previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the inclination angle has an important effect on the sed and that the evolutionary state of an object can not be derived from sed slopes alone .",
    "thus , there is a difference between the `` stage '' and `` class '' of an object @xcite ; stage 0 and i objects are characterized by substantial envelopes , stage ii objects are surrounded by optically thick disks , with possibly some remnant infalling envelopes , and stage iii objects have optically thin disks .    in general ,",
    "the trends we see among model parameters are a consequence of the definition of a protostar based on its sed : in order to be classified as a class 0 or i object , a protostar is required to have a near- to mid - infrared sed slope larger than 0.3 .",
    "a protostellar model with a small cavity opening angle , small centrifugal radius , and/or high inclination angle will generate such an sed , since it increases the optical depth along the line of sight .",
    "models with a large cavity will only yield a rising sed in the 2@xmath17440 @xmath0 m spectral range if their envelope density is large or the inclination angle is relatively high .",
    "we find that class 0 protostars can be best fit not only by very high envelope densities but also moderately high envelope densities and large inclination angles .",
    "the bolometric temperature , which is used to separate class  0 from class  i protostars , is inclination dependent ; some class  i protostars are shifted to the class  0 regime if they are viewed more edge - on .",
    "the higher - density class  i protostars tend to have lower inclination angles ( but still @xmath26 50 ) ; thus , their evolutionary stage could be similar to more embedded protostars that are seen edge - on and classified as class 0 protostars .",
    "conversely , some class  0 objects with large inclination angles , but lower envelope densities , could be in a later evolutionary stage than typical class  0 protostars .",
    "similarly , class i protostars with large @xmath84 and low @xmath68 values could be edge - on stage ii objects ( whose infrared emission is dominated by a disk ) . finally , low - inclination stage 0 and i protostars can appear as a flat - spectrum sources @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the observed trend in envelope densities suggests that the variations in the observed seds track , in great part , an evolution toward lower envelope densities and lower infall rates . assuming a certain mass for the central star , the reference density in our models can be used to infer an envelope infall rate ( @xmath197 ) . as mentioned in section [ model_parameters ] , this infall rate is model dependent and therefore tied to the assumptions of the models . with this in mind",
    ", the median @xmath68 values for the class 0 , class i , and flat - spectrum protostars in our sample correspond to envelope infall rates of @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 @xmath42  yr@xmath54 , respectively , for a 0.5 @xmath42  star . using a more realistic assumption of larger stellar mass for more evolved protostars ,",
    "the infall rates for class i and flat - spectrum protostars would be larger than these values by a factor of a few .",
    "however , just larger stellar masses can not explain the large decrease of a factor of 50 in the median envelope density from class 0 to flat - spectrum protostars ; to achieve such a decrease with a constant infall rate of @xmath198 @xmath42  yr@xmath54 , the stellar mass would have to increase by a factor of 2500 .",
    "thus , within the context of our model fits , we can conclude that , as envelopes become more tenuous , the infall rates also decrease .",
    "other trends are also apparent . class",
    "0 protostars and flat - spectrum sources show a relatively flat distribution of cavity opening angles . on the other hand , the best fit for a large fraction of class i protostars ( 40% ) results in @xmath76=5 .",
    "this could point to a degeneracy in the models , since protostars with small cavity opening angles tend to have lower envelope densities ( and also lower total luminosities ) ; thus , the smaller cavity partly compensates for the lower opacity resulting from the lower envelope density ( see also figure [ rho1000_inc_cavity ] ) .    even though our models do not yield reliable disk properties",
    ", we can make a statement about the difference in the best - fit centrifugal radii ( or @xmath49 ) , which are tied to the structure of the rotating envelope given by the model fits .",
    "it should be noted that the centrifugal radii set a lower limit to the disk radii , since disks may spread outward due to viscous accretion .",
    "most class i protostars and flat - spectrum sources are fit with a centrifugal radius of just 5 au . since the smallest centrifugal radius in our model grid is 5 au and the next value is 50 au , we can state that , except for class 0 protostars , most protostars in our sample have @xmath201  au , and some might even have @xmath202 5  au .",
    "small disks of those sizes have been observed ; radio interferometry of the multiple protostellar system l1551 irs 5 shows disks whose semi - major axes are @xmath119  20  au @xcite .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy between the centrifugal radius and the envelope density ; for protostars with low envelope densities , the small centrifugal radius can compensate the decrease in opacity by concentrating more material closer to the star .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ rho1000_inc_rdisk ] , most protostars with @xmath203 5 au also have lower envelope densities .",
    "inclination angle also plays a role ; protostars seen at @xmath192 80  typically have larger centrifugal radii . in addition , our envelope models include outflow cavities , which allow some of the mid - ir radiation to escape . in order to generate model seds with silicate absorption features and steep mid - ir slopes at low to intermediate inclination angles ,",
    "a lower @xmath49 value is needed .",
    "we will discuss the potential implications of the small cavity sizes and @xmath44 values for class i protostars and flat - spectrum sources in section [ model_problems ] .      among the class",
    "0 protostars , there are protostars in the earliest evolutionary stages , when the envelope is massive and the protostar still has to accrete most of its mass .",
    "@xcite identified 18 protostars with very red mid- to far - infrared colors ( @xmath204 @xmath26 1.65 ) , of which 11 were newly identified ( see table d[new_proto ] ) .",
    "@xcite added an additional object .",
    "these protostars were named pacs bright red sources ( pbrs ) by @xcite ; they are hops 169 , 341 , 354 , 358 , 359 , 372 , 373 , 394 , 397 - 405 , 407 , and 409 . based on their steep 24 - 70 @xmath0 m seds and large submillimeter luminosities ,",
    "they were interpreted as the youngest protostars in orion with very dense envelopes .    from our best - fit models to the seds of the pbrs , we derive a median @xmath68 value of 1.2 @xmath205 10@xmath206 g @xmath33 , which is twice as high as the median value of all the class 0 protostars in our sample",
    ". these fits also result in a median envelope mass within 2500 au of 0.66 @xmath42  for the pbrs , but the individual objects cover a large range , from 0.07 to 1.83 @xmath42 . the median total luminosity amounts to 5.6 @xmath19  ( with a range from 0.6 to 71.0 @xmath19 ) , which is very similar to the median @xmath82 value for the class 0 protostars in our sample .",
    "most pbrs ( 14 out of 19 protostars ) are fit by models with large inclination angles ( @xmath182 70 ) , but , as shown in @xcite , high inclination alone can not explain the redness of the pbrs .",
    "thus , our models confirm the results of @xcite that the pbrs are deeply embedded and thus likely among the youngest protostars in orion .      a particularly interesting group of protostars that are not easy to categorize are the flat - spectrum sources .",
    "they are thought to include objects in transition between stages i and ii , when the envelope is being dispersed @xcite . in particular , those with low envelope densities could be more evolved protostars , or they could be protostars that started out with more tenuous envelopes .",
    "on the other hand , flat - spectrum sources could also be highly inclined disk sources ( see * ? ? ? * ) , or protostars surrounded by dense envelopes , but seen close to face - on @xcite .",
    "this type of misclassification could have a large effect on the lifetimes of the earlier protostellar stages and thus on the timeline of envelope dispersal . among the 330 hops targets in our sample",
    ", we identified 102 flat - spectrum sources based on their flat ( @xmath4 to @xmath207 ) spectral index from 4.5 to 24 @xmath0 m ( or 5 - 25 @xmath0 m in a few cases ) .",
    "thus , they compose a fairly large fraction of our protostellar sample . of these 102 objects ,",
    "47 have a negative spectral index and 55 have one between 0 and @xmath207 ; 41 have a spectral index between @xmath208 and 0.1 , which results in a very flat mid - infrared sed .    despite a flat sed slope between 4.5 and 24 @xmath0 m",
    ", many flat - spectrum sources display a weak silicate emission or absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m , which may indicate the presence of a very tenuous infalling envelope or may be the result of the viewing geometry .",
    "some seds are very flat out to 100 @xmath0 m , others have negative spectral slopes beyond 40 @xmath0 m , and again others a rising sed from the mid- to the far - ir .",
    "there are also objects with more pronounced absorption features due to not only silicates but also ices , as are typically found in class 0 and i protostars , but also edge - on disks ( see hops 82 , 85 , 89 , 90 , 92 , 129 , 150 , 200 , 210 , 211 , 281 , 304 , 331 , and 363 ) .",
    "only two flat - spectrum sources have prominent silicate emission features , and their seds are reminiscent of protoplanetary disks ( see hops 187 and 199 ) .",
    "thus , flat - spectrum sources likely include objects of a variety of evolutionary stages .",
    "values at each inclination angle for the class 0 and i protostars ( _ squares _ ) and the flat - spectrum sources ( _ circles _ ) in our sample .",
    "[ rho_inc_flat - spectrum ] ]    the latter conclusion can also be drawn when analyzing the distribution of envelope reference densities and inclination angles for flat - spectrum sources . in figure",
    "[ rho_inc_class ] , we showed that flat - spectrum sources typically have intermediate inclination angles and lower envelope densities . to compare their properties more directly to class 0 and i protostars , in figure [ rho_inc_flat - spectrum ]",
    "we show the median best - fit @xmath68 value at each best - fit inclination angle ; it is larger for class 0 and i protostars than for flat - spectrum sources at all inclination angles . for class 0 and i protostars ,",
    "the median @xmath68 value is highest at intermediate inclination angles , decreases at larger inclination angles , and then increases again for @xmath192 80 . for flat - spectrum sources ,",
    "the median @xmath68 value is relatively flat over the 1863region but has its peak value at @xmath18141 ; it decreases for larger inclination angles .",
    "the only flat - spectrum source with a best - fit inclination angle of 81 , hops 357 , has a very low envelope density ( the lowest value for this parameter in the model grid ) , and its spectrum displays a deep silicate absorption feature .",
    "overall , this shows that , while a range of envelope densities and inclination angles can explain flat - spectrum sources , their envelope densities are typically lower than for class 0 and i protostars .",
    "the higher - density objects are seen at low to intermediate inclination angles , while only the lowest - density objects are seen closer to edge - on",
    ". some of the high - density flat - spectrum sources could actually be more embedded protostars ( stage 0 objects ) seen face - on ( which would be classified as class 0 objects if seen at larger inclination angles ) .",
    "thus , in terms of envelope evolution , they include a diverse group of objects .",
    "we note that even though we find that flat - spectrum sources have in general lower envelope densities than class 0 and class i objects , their best fit does include an envelope in almost all cases ; just 3 of the 102 flat - spectrum sources are best fit without an envelope .",
    "this seems to contradict recent findings by @xcite , who found that only about 50% of flat - spectrum sources were actually protostars surrounded by envelopes .",
    "this could be partly explained by different criteria used to select flat - spectrum sources ; in the @xcite sample , flat - spectrum sources are selected by their extinction - corrected 2 - 24 @xmath0 m spectral index ( see also @xcite ) , while our sample uses a flat 4.5 - 24 @xmath0 m spectral index .",
    "moreover , in their study @xcite detected the presence of an envelope via hco@xmath209 emission , and they found that almost all sources detected in the sub - mm are also detected in hco@xmath209 ( but the opposite does not always hold ) . for our sample of orion protostars , we find that 75% of class 0+i protostars observed with saboca ( 350 @xmath0 m ) are detected , while only 47% of flat - spectrum sources have detections . for laboca observations ( 870 @xmath0 m )",
    ", these two fractions amount to 41% and 21% , respectively .",
    "thus , we find that flat - spectrum sources have a @xmath1 50% lower sub - mm detection rate than class 0+i protostars .",
    "flat - spectrum sources without sub - mm detections would likely also not display hco@xmath209 emission and thus would be considered as protostars without envelopes by @xcite .    to compare how our submillimeter detections correlate with the presence of an envelope , in figures [ rho_f350 ] and [ rho_f870 ] we show the derived best - fit reference envelope densities as a function of 350 or 870 @xmath0 m fluxes for the combined class 0+i sample and the flat - spectrum sources .",
    "we also differentiate the distribution of envelope densities between measured flux values and upper limits ; at 870 @xmath0 m , the upper limits are often cases where the sources are not detected due to confusion with bright , spatially varying emission .",
    "we find that even protostars with upper limits at 350 and 870 @xmath0 m are best fit with an envelope ; however , the envelope density is lower for objects with upper limits in the sub - mm .",
    "this is especially evident for class 0+i protostars ; for flat - spectrum sources , the distributions of envelope densities for sub - mm detections and upper limits show significant overlap .",
    "four times as many flat - spectrum sources have upper limits instead of detections at 870 @xmath0 m , but their derived @xmath68 values span almost the full range of values .",
    "furthermore , the median @xmath68 value of 1.19 @xmath210 g @xmath33 for sources without detections is relatively close to the median value of 5.95 @xmath71 g @xmath33 for the sources with 870 @xmath0 m detections .",
    "thus , our model fits do not rely on sub - mm detections to yield a best fit with an envelope ; in most cases the near- to far - ir sed is sufficient to constrain the properties of the envelope .      among the six objects",
    "whose best - fit sed required no envelope ( @xmath68 value of 0 ) , three are flat - spectrum sources ( hops 47 , 187 , 265 ) , two are class ii pre - main - sequence stars ( hops 113 , 293 ) , and one is a class i protostar ( hops 232 ) .",
    "the low 70 @xmath0",
    "m fluxes of hops 47 and 265 constrained the best model to one without an envelope .",
    "the sed of hops 187 looks like that of a transitional disk , which are disks with gaps or holes in their inner regions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if hops 187 were a transitional disk , it would not have an envelope .",
    "hops 232 has a rising sed over the mid - ir spectral range ; its best fit requires no envelope , but an edge - on disk with a high accretion luminosity .",
    "it would be expected that the seds of class ii objects can be best fit by a model that does not include an envelope .",
    "this is the case for hops 113 and 293 .",
    "of the nine remaining class ii objects in our sample , four have very low envelope densities ( @xmath211 g @xmath33 ; hops 22 , 26 , 98 , 283 ) , while five have @xmath68 between @xmath212 and @xmath213 g @xmath33 ( hops 184 , 201 , 222 , 272 , 277 ) .",
    "the seds of hops 22 , 184 , and 201 are similar to those of transitional disks , with some silicate emission at 10 @xmath0 m and a rising sed between about 13 and 20 @xmath0 m .",
    "the best - fit models require some envelope emission to fit the long - wavelength data .",
    "hops 222 , 272 , and 277 lie close to the border between a class ii pre - main - sequence star and a flat - spectrum source based on their 4.5 - 24 @xmath0 m spectral index , and therefore they could have some envelope material left , despite being classified as class ii objects .",
    "overall , of the 330 ysos in our sample , 319 were classified as either class 0 , class i , or flat - spectrum protostars based on their seds . however , four of them are best fit without an envelope .",
    "conversely , of the 11 class ii objects in our sample , nine are best fit with an envelope ; however , three of these might be transitional disks . thus , based on our model",
    "fits and seds , 321 of our 330 ysos are protostars with envelopes , and nine are likely pre - main - sequence stars with disks .",
    "the luminosity distribution of protostars is a significant constraint on protostellar evolution , and it is important to understand the effect of the envelope on the observed luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

[ hops_n_tbol_lbol_histo ] ) . in contrast , the distribution of the total luminosities from the models shows a peak near 2.5  @xmath19  ( fig .  [ ltot_class_histo ] ) , indicating that the luminosities of protostars may be systematically underestimated by the bolometric luminosities , which do not take into account the inclination angle ( and thus beaming of the radiation along the outflow cavities ) as well as foreground extinction ( see fig .",

    "higher intrinsic luminosities for protostars could help address the `` luminosity problem '' first pointed out by @xcite , who found that the luminosities of protostars are lower by about an order of magnitude than a simple estimate of the expected accretion luminosity .",

    "our best - fit models also suggest that class 0 protostars have a different distribution of @xmath82 values compared to class i protostars or flat - spectrum sources .",
    "their median total luminosity is higher , which could be an indication of larger accretion luminosities for younger protostars .",
    "we must bear in mind the caveats and degeneracies mentioned above ; in particular , in some cases the higher luminosity could be related to the adoption of an overly large inclination angle , which results in most of the emitted radiation not reaching the observer . nevertheless , these differences have potentially important implications for protostellar evolution , which will be discussed in a future publication ( w. fischer et al .",

    "for example , models with high envelope densities viewed more edge - on require large cavity opening angles and high @xmath82 values to generate sufficient mid - ir flux ; this is the case for a few of our highest - luminosity objects ( hops 87 , 108 , and 178 ) .",
    "these trends do not support the notion of increasing cavity size with later evolutionary stage , which would be expected if outflows play a major role in dispersing envelopes @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that cavity sizes are not growing with time ; however , this may also imply a deviation from spherical symmetry for the initial configuration of the collapsing envelopes .",
    "such a deviation may result if the envelope collapses from the fragmentation of a flattened sheet or elongated filament .",
    "finally , we find an excess of small values of @xmath49 , and therefore small centrifugal radii , for class i and flat - spectrum protostars ( figure [ rdisk_class_histo ] ) .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation from the tsc model , in which the late stages of protostellar evolution are characterized by the infall of high angular momentum material from large radii and hence larger values of @xmath44 .",
    "this may imply that disks sizes are small , but it may also be the result of incorrect assumptions about the distribution of angular momentum in the tsc model .    in total , these `` conundrums '' that arise from our model fits hint that the current models do not realistically reproduce the structure of collapsing envelopes .",
    "future high - resolution observations at submillimeter and longer wavelengths that resolve the structure and motions of envelopes may provide the means to develop more refined models that can fit the seds with more realistic envelope configurations .",
    "we have presented seds and model fits for 330 young stellar objects in the orion a and b molecular clouds .",
    "the seds include data from 1.2 to 870 @xmath0 m , with near - infrared photometry from 2mass , mid - infrared photometry and spectra from the _ spitzer space telescope _ , far - infrared photometry at 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath0 m from the _ herschel space observatory _ , and submillimeter photometry from the apex telescope .",
    "we calculated bolometric luminosities ( @xmath16 ) , bolometric temperatures ( @xmath8 ) , and 4.5 - 24 @xmath0 m spectral indices ( @xmath18 ) for all 330 sources in our sample . from the distributions of these three parameters , we find that @xmath16 has a broad peak near 1 @xmath19  and extends from 0.02 to several hundred @xmath19 , while the distribution of @xmath8 values is broad and flat from about 30 k to 800 k , with a median value of 146 k. the 4.5 - 24 @xmath0 m spectral indices range from -0.75 to 2.6 , with a peak near 0 .    based on traditional classification schemes involving @xmath18 and @xmath8 ,",
    "we have identified 92 sources as class 0 protostars ( @xmath214 and @xmath215  k ) , 125 as class i protostars ( @xmath214 and @xmath216  k ) , and 102 as flat - spectrum sources ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the remaining 11 sources are class ii pre - main - sequence stars with @xmath217 ; most of them just missed the flat - spectrum cutoff , and three have seds typical of disks with inner holes . considering these transitional disks and ysos whose best fit does not require an envelope , we find that 321 of the 330 hops targets in our sample are protostars with envelopes . class 0 and i protostars often display a deep silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m due to the presence of the envelope , while many flat - spectrum sources have a weak silicate emission or absorption feature at that wavelength .",
    "we have used a grid of 30,400 protostellar model seds , calculated using the 2008 version of the @xcite monte carlo radiative transfer code , to find the best - fit models for each observed sed .",
    "the grid is limited to discrete values for protostellar parameters , and their ranges were chosen to represent typical protostars . within the framework of these models , we find the following :    * about 70% of class 0 protostars , 75% of class i protostars , and close to 90% of flat - spectrum sources have reliable sed fits ( @xmath159 , where @xmath154 is a measure of the average distance between model and data in units of the fractional uncertainty ) .",
    "thus , our model grid can reproduce most of the observed seds of orion protostars . *",
    "our results show a clear trend of decreasing envelope densities as we progress from class 0 to class i and then to flat - spectrum sources : we find that the median @xmath68 values decrease from 5.9 @xmath72 g @xmath33 to 2.4 @xmath71 g @xmath33 to 1.2 @xmath71 g @xmath33 .",
    "the decrease in densities implies a decrease in the infall rates of the protostars as they evolve .",
    "we find that the pacs bright red sources ( pbrs ) have median @xmath68 values twice as high as the median value of the class 0 protostars in our sample , supporting the interpretation that they are likely the youngest protostars in orion .",
    "* there are degeneracies in the parameters for models that reproduce the observed seds .",
    "for example , increasing the mid - ir sed slope and deepening the silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m of a model protostar can be done by increasing the envelope density or inclination angle , decreasing the cavity opening angle or centrifugal radius , or even increasing the foreground extinction .",
    "hence , the properties of a specific source may be fit by a wide range of parameters .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are particularly uncertain for objects whose sed is not well constrained by observations . because of these degeneracies , the observed classes contain a mixture of evolutionary stages . * we find that flat - spectrum sources are particularly well fit by our models .",
    "they have , on average , lower envelope densities and intermediate inclination angles , so many flat - spectrum sources are likely more evolved protostars , but this group also includes protostars with higher envelope densities ( and sometimes larger cavity opening angles ) seen at lower inclination angles .",
    "flat - spectrum sources seen at @xmath192 65  have very tenuous envelopes .",
    "thus , the sample of flat - spectrum sources includes protostars at different stages in their envelope evolution .",
    "all but three of the flat - spectrum sources in our sample have envelopes in their best - fit models , indicating that , with a small number of exceptions , these objects are protostars with infalling gas . * the luminosity function for the model luminosities peaks at a higher luminosity than that for the observed bolometric luminosities as a result of beaming along the outflow cavities .",
    "furthermore , the total luminosity determined by the models is higher for class 0 protostars : the median total luminosities are 5.5 , 2.0 , and 3.0 @xmath19  for class 0 , class i , and flat - spectrum sources , respectively . * since heating by external radiation fields is not included in our model grid , we assessed its influence by adding an interstellar radiation field to a set of models .",
    "we find that an isrf ten times that typical of the solar neighborhood can substantially change the seds of sources with internal luminosities of 0.1 @xmath19 .",
    "however , when we incorporate the effect of extinction on the external radiation field , the effect on the protostellar seds is smaller ; the best - fit luminosities and envelope densities would be overestimated by factors of a few for @xmath1 0.1 @xmath19  prototars and much less for higher - luminosity protostars .",
    "we estimate that the best - fit parameters ( in particular , @xmath82 , @xmath68 ) of @xmath1 20% of the hops sources could be affected by external heating . *",
    "although the adopted tsc models reproduce the observed seds well , there are trends that suggest inadequacies with these models .",
    "first , the distribution of best - fit inclination angles does not reproduce that expected for randomly oriented protostars .",
    "second , although the distribution of outflow cavity sizes for flat - spectrum and class  0 sources is flat , there is an excess of small cavities for class i sources .",
    "this is in contradiction to the typical picture that outflow cavities grow as protostars evolve .",
    "finally , the distribution of outer disk radii set by the rotation of the envelope is concentrated at small values ( @xmath29 50 au ) for the class i and flat - spectrum sources but is slightly tilted toward large values ( @xmath26 50 au ) for class 0 protostars .",
    "again , this trend contradicts the expected growth of disks as the infall region in protostellar envelopes expands .",
    "these findings suggest that either the envelope structure of the adopted models is incorrect , or our understanding of the evolution of protostars needs to be revised substantially .",
    "our work provides a large sample of protostars in one molecular cloud complex for future , more detailed studies of protostellar evolution .",
    "for example , using additional constraints , such as from scattered light imaging , the structure of envelope cavities and thus the role of outflows can be better understood .",
    "in addition , the detailed structure of the envelope and the disk embedded within , as well as multiplicity of the central source , can be studied with high spatial resolution imaging such as alma can provide . with the analysis of their seds presented in this work",
    ", the hops protostars constitute an ideal sample to derive a better understanding of the early evolution of young stars , when the assembly of the stellar mass and the initial stages of planet formation likely take place .",

    "the sl spectrum was scaled by 2.5 ; if instead the ll spectrum had been scaled down , the discrepancies between irs and irac and mips would be less than 50% .",
    "overall , in cases where the irs spectrum has sufficient signal - to - noise ratio and its fluxes seem lower than the photometric measurements or the discrepancies in irac - irs and mips - irs fluxes are quite different , intrinsic source variability could be a likely explanation . among the sample shown in table b[hops_variables ]",

    "we plot the difference between the indices of modes and best - fit values . for example , if the best - fit inclination angle has a value of 41  and the mode a value of 57 , the difference in indices would be 2 ( since the discrete values in our model grid are 18 , 32 , 41 , 50 , 57 , etc . ) .",
