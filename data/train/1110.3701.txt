    "x - ray pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems , accreting matter from a companion star",
    ". the companion may be a low - mass star overfilling its roche lobe in which case an accretion disc is formed . in the case of a high - mass companion ,",
    "the neutron star may also accrete from the strong stellar wind and depending on the conditions a disc may be formed or accretion may take place quasi - spherically .",
    "the strong magnetic field of the neutron star disrupts the accretion flow at some distance from the neutron star surface and forces the accreted matter to funnel down on the polar caps of the neutron star creating hot spots that , if misaligned with the rotational axis , make the neutron star pulsate in x - rays .",
    "most accreting pulsars show stochastic variations in their spin frequencies as well as in their luminosities .",
    "many sources also exhibit long - term trends in their spin - behaviour with the period more or less steadily increasing or decreasing and in some sources spin - reversals have been observed .",
    "( for a thorough review , see e.g. bildsten 1997 and references therein . )",
    "the best - studied case of accretion is that of thin disc accretion ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . here",
    "the spin - up / spin - down mechanisms are rather well understood . for disc accretion the spin - up torque is determined by the specific angular momentum at the inner edge of the disc and can be written in the form @xmath4 ( pringle and rees , 1972 ) . for a pulsar the inner radius of the accretion disc is determined by the alfven radius @xmath5 , @xmath6 , so @xmath7 , i.e. for disc accretion the spin - up torque is weakly ( almost linearly ) dependent on the accretion rate ( x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "in contrast , the spin - down torque for disc accretion in the first approximation is independent of @xmath8 : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the corotation radius , @xmath11 is the neutron star angular frequency and @xmath12 is the neutron star s dipole magnetic moment . in fact ,",
    "accretion torques in disc accretion are determined by a complicated disc - magnetospheric interaction , see , e.g. , ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) , lovelace et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the discussion in kluniak & rappaport ( 2007 ) , and correpsondingly can have a more complicated dependence on the mass accretion rate and other parameters .",
    "measurements of spin - up / spin - down in x - ray pulsars can be used to evaluate a very important parameter of the neutron star ",
    "its magnetic field .",
    "the period of the pulsar is usually close to the equilibrium value @xmath13 , which is determined by the total zero torque applied to the neutron star , @xmath14 . so assuming the observed value @xmath15 , the magnetic field of the neutron star in disc - accreting x - ray pulsars can be estimated if @xmath8 is known . in the case of quasi - spherical accretion , which can take place in systems where the optical star underfills its roche lobe and no accretion disc is formed , the situation is more complicated . clearly , the amount and sign of the angular mometum supplied to the neutron star from the captured stellar wind are important for spin - up or spin - down . to within a numerical factor ( which can be positive or negative ,",
    "see numerical simulations by fryxell & taam ( 1988 ) , ruffert ( 1997 ) , ruffert ( 1999 ) , etc . ) , the torque applied to the neutron star in this case should be proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the binary orbital angular frequency , @xmath18 is the gravitational capture ( bondi ) radius , @xmath19 is the stellar wind velocity at the neutron star orbital distance , and @xmath20 is the neutron star orbital velocity . in real high - mass x - ray binaries the orbital eccentricity is non - zero , the stellar wind is variable and can be inhomogeneous , etc .",
    ", so @xmath21 can be a complicated function of time .",
    "the spin - down torque is even more uncertain , since it is impossible to write down a simple equation like @xmath22 any more ( @xmath23 has no meaning for quasi - spherical accretion ; for slowly rotating pulsars it is much larger than the alfven radius where the angular momentum transfer from the accreting matter to the magnetosphere actually occurs ) .",
    "for example , if one uses for the braking torque @xmath22 , the magnetic field in long - period x - ray pulsars turns out very high .",
    "we think this is a result of underestimating the braking torque .",
    "the matter captured from the stellar wind can accrete onto the neutron star in different ways . indeed ,",
    "if the x - ray flux from the accreting neutron star is sufficiently high , the shocked matter rapidly cools down due to compton processes and freely falls down toward the magnetosphere .",
    "the velocity of motion rapidly becomes supersonic , so a shock is formed above the magnetosphere .",
    "this regime was considered , e.g. , by burnard et al .",
    "depending on the sign of the specific angular momentum of falling matter ( prograde or retrograde ) , the neutron star can spin - up or spin - down . however , if the x - ray flux at the bondi radius is below some value , the shocked matter remains hot , the radial velocity of the plasma is subsonic , and the settling accretion regime sets in . a hot quasi - static shell forms around the magnetosphere ( davies & pringle , 1981 ) .",
    "due to additional energy release ( especially near the base of the shell ) , the temperature gradient across the shell becomes superadiabatic , so large - scale convective motions inevitably appear . the convection intitiates turbulence , and",
    "the motion of a fluid element in the shell becomes quite complicated .",
    "if the magnetosphere allows plasma entry via instabilities ( and subsequent accretion onto the neutron star ) , the actual accretion rate through such a shell is controlled by the magnetosphere ( for example , the shell can exist , but the accretion through it can be weak or even absent altogether ) .",
    "so on top of the convective motions , the mean radial velocity of matter toward the magnetosphere , a subsonic settling , appears .",
    "this picture of accretion is realized at relatively small x - ray luminositites , @xmath24  erg / s ( see below ) , and is totally different from what was considered in numerical simulations cited above .",
    "if the shell is present , its interaction with the rotating magnetosphere can lead to spin - up or spin - down of the neutron star , depending on the sign of the angular velocity difference between the accreting matter and the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "so in the settling accretion regime , both spin - up or spin - down of the neutron star is possible , even if the sign of the specific angular momentum of captured matter is prograde .",
    "the shell here mediates the angular momentum transfer to or from the rotating neutron star .",
    "one can find several models in the literature ( see especially illarionov & kompaneets 1990 and bisnovatyi - kogan 1991 ) , from which the expression for the spin - down torque for quasi - spherically accreting neutron stars in the form @xmath25 can be derived .",
    "moreover , the expression for the alfven radius @xmath5 in the case of settling accretion is found to have different dependence on the mass accretion rate @xmath8 and neutron star magnetic moment @xmath12 , @xmath26 , than the standard expression for disc accretion , @xmath27 , so the spin - down torque for quasi - spherical settling accretion depends on the accretion rate as @xmath28 ( see below ) .    to stress the difference between quasi - spherical and disc accretion , it is also instructive to rewrite the expression for the spin - down torque using the corotation and alfven radii as @xmath29 ( see more detail below in section 4 ) . since the factor",
    "@xmath30 can be of the order of 10 or higher in real systems , using a braking torque in the form @xmath31 leads to a strong overestimation of the magnetic field .",
    "the dependence of the braking torque on the accretion rate in the case of quasi - spherical settling accretion suggests that variations of the mass accretion rate ( and x - ray luminosity ) must lead to a transition from spin - up ( at high accretion rates ) to spin - down ( at small accretion rates ) at some critical value of @xmath8 ( or @xmath5 ) , that differs from source to source .",
    "this phenomenon ( also known as torque reversal ) is actually observed in wind - fed pulsars like vela x-1 , gx 301 - 2 and gx 1 + 4 , which we shall consider below in more detail .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present an outline of the theory for quasi - spherical accretion onto a neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a hot envelope around the neutron star through which accretion can take place and act to either spin up or spin down the neutron star . in section 3 , we discuss the structure of the interchange instability region which determines whether the plasma can enter the magnetosphere of the rotating neutron star . in section 4",
    "we consider how the spin - up / spin - down torques vary with a changing accretion rate . in section 5 ,",
    "we show how to determine the parameters of quasi - spherical accretion and the neutron star magnetic field from observational data . in section 6 , we apply our methods to the specific pulsars gx 301 - 2 , vela x-1 and gx 1 + 4 . in section 7",
    "we discuss our results and , finally , in section 8 we present our conclusions . a detailed gas - dynamic treatment of the problem is presented in four appendices , which are very important to understand the physical processes involved .",
    "we shall here consider the torques applied to a neutron star in the case of quasi - spherical accretion from a stellar wind .",
    "wind matter is gravitationally captured by the moving neutron star and a bow - shock is formed at a characteristic distance @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the bondi radius .",
    "angular momentum can be removed from the neutron star magnetosphere in two ways  either with matter expelled from the magnetospheric boundary without accretion ( the propeller regime , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) , or via convective motions , which bring away angular momentum in a subsonic quasi - static shell around the magnetosphere , with accretion ( the settling accretion regime ) . in such a quasi - static shell , the temperature will be high ( of the order of the virial temperature , see davies and pringle ( 1981 ) ) , and the important point is whether hot matter from the shell can in fact enter the magnetosphere .",
    "two - dimensional calculations by elsner and lamb ( 1977 ) have shown that hot monoatomic ideal plasma is stable relative to the rayleigh - taylor instability at the magnetospheric boundary , and plasma cooling is thus needed for accretion to begin . however",
    ", a closer inspection of the 3-dimensional calculations by arons and lea ( 1976a ) reveals that the hot plasma is only marginally stable at the magnetospheric equator ( to within 5% accuracy of their calculations ) .",
    "compton cooling and the possible presence of dissipative phenomena ( magnetic reconnection etc . ) facilitates the plasma entering the magnetosphere .",
    "we will show that both accretion of matter from a hot envelope and spin - down of the neutron star is indeed possible .      to a zeroth approximation",
    ", we can neglect both rotation and radial motion ( accretion ) of matter in the shell and consider only its hydrostatic structure .",
    "the radial velocity of matter falling through the shell @xmath34 is lower than the sound velocity @xmath35 . under these assumptions , the characteristic cooling / heating time - scale is much larger than the free - fall time - scale .    in the general case where both gas pressure and anisotropic turbulent motions are present , pascal s law is violated . then the hydrostatic equilibrium equation can be derived from the equation of motion with stress tensor components - and zero viscosity ( see appendix a for more detail ) : -- + -=0 here @xmath36 is the gas pressure , and @xmath37 stands for the pressure due to turbulent motions : p_^t = = m_^2 c_s^2=p_g m_^2 p_^t = = m_^2 c_s^2 = p_g m_^2 ( @xmath38 is the turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are turbulent mach numbers squared in the radial and tangential directions , respectively ; for example , in the case of isotropic turbulence @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the turbulent mach number ) .",
    "the total pressure is the sum of the gas and turbulence terms : @xmath43 .",
    "we shall consider , to a first approximation , that the entropy distribution in the shell is constant .",
    "integrating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , we readily get = =( , m_t ) .",
    "( in this solution we have neglected the integration constant , which is not important deep inside the shell .",
    "it is important in the outer part of the shell , but since the outer region close to the bow shock at @xmath44 is not spherically symmetric , its structure can be found only numerically ) .",
    "note that taking turbulence into account somewhat decreases the temperature within the shell .",
    "most important , however , is that the anisotropy of turbulent motions , caused by convection in the stationary case , changes the distribution of the angular velocity in the shell .",
    "below we will show that in the case of isotropic turbulence , the angular velocity distribution within the shell is close to the quasi - keplerian one , @xmath45 . in the case of strongly anisotropic turbulence caused by convection , @xmath46 , an approximately iso - angular - momentum distribution , @xmath47 is realized within the shell .",
    "below we shall see that teh analysis of rela x - ray pulsars favors the iso - angular - momentum rotation distribution .",
    "now , let us write down how the density varies inside the quasi - static shell for @xmath48 .",
    "for a fully ionized gas with @xmath49 we find : ( r)=(r_a)^3/2 and for the gas pressure : p(r)=p(r_a ) ^5/2 .",
    "the above equations describe the structure of an ideal static adiabatic shell above the magnetosphere .",
    "of course , at @xmath32 the problem is essentially non - spherically symmetric and numerical simulations are required .",
    "corrections to the adiabatic temperature gradient due to convective energy transport through the shell are calculated in appendix c.      at the magnetospheric boundary ( the alfven surface ) , the total pressure ( including isotropic gas pressure and the possibly anisotropic turbulent pressure ) is balanced by the magnetic pressure @xmath50 p_g+p_t = p_g(r_a)(1+m_t^2)=. the magnetic field at the alfven radius is determined by the dipole magnetic field and by electric currents flowing on the alfvenic surface",
    "p_g(r_a)= ^6 = where the dimensionless coefficient @xmath51 takes into account the contribution from these currents and the factor @xmath52 is due to the turbulent pressure term .",
    "for example , in the model by arons and lea ( 1976a , their eq .",
    "31 ) , @xmath53 . at the magnetospheric cusp ( where the magnetic force line is branched )",
    ", the radius of the alfven surface is about 0.51 times that of the equatorial radius ( arons and lea , 1976a ) .",
    "below we shall assume that @xmath5 is the equatorial radius of the magnetosphere , unless stated otherwise .",
    "due to the interchange instability , the plasma can enter the neutron star magnetosphere . in the stationary regime , let us introduce the accretion rate @xmath8 onto the neutron star surface . from the continuity equation in the shell we find ( r_a)= clearly , the velocity of absorption of matter by the magnetosphere is smaller than the free - fall velocity , so we introduce a dimensionless factor @xmath54 .",
    "then the density at the magnetospheric boundary is ( r_a)=. for example , in the model calculations by arons & lea ( 1976a ) @xmath55 ; in our case , at high x - ray luminosities the value of @xmath56 can attain @xmath57 .",
    "it is possible to imagine that the shell is impenetrable and that there is no accretion through it , @xmath58 . in this case",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 , while the density in the shell remains finite . in some sense , the matter leaks from the magnetosphere down to the neutron star , and the leakage can be either small ( @xmath58 ) or large ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "plugging @xmath62 into and using and the definition of the dipole magnetic moment @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the neutron star radius ) , we find r_a=^2/7 .",
    "it should be stressed that in the presence of a hot shell the alfven radius is determined by the static gas pressure at the magnetospheric boundary , which is non - zero even for a zero - mass accretion rate through the shell , so the appearance of @xmath8 in the above formula is strictly formal .",
    "we now consider a quasi - stationary subsonic shell in which accretion proceeds onto the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "we stress that in this regime , i.e. the settling regime , the accretion rate onto the neutron star is determined by the denisity at the bottom of the shell ( which is directly related to the density downstream the bow shock in the gravitational capture region ) and the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere through the alfven surface .",
    "the rotation law in the shell depends on the treatment of the turbulent viscosity ( see appendix a for the prandtl law and isotropic turbulence ) and the possible anisotropy of the turbulence due to convection ( see appendix b ) . in the last case the anistropy leads to more powerful radial turbulence than in the perpendicular directions .",
    "thus , as shown in appendix a and b , there is a set of quasi - power - law solutions for the radial dependence of the angular rotation velocity in a convective shell .",
    "we shall consider a power - law dependence of the angular velocity on radius , ( r)~r^-n we will study in detail the quasi - keplerian law with @xmath65 , and the iso - angular - momentum distribution with @xmath66 , which in some sense are limiting cases among the possible solutions .    when approaching the bow shock , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "near the bow shock the problem is not spherically symmetric any more since the flow is more complicated ( part of the flow bends across the shell ) , and the structure of the flow can be studied only using numerical simulations . in the absence of such simulations",
    ", we shall assume that the iso - angular - momentum distribution is valid up to the nearest distance to the bow shock from the neutron star which we shall take to be the gravitational capture radius @xmath33 , @xmath69 where @xmath19 is the stellar wind velocity at the neutron star orbital distance , and @xmath20 is the neutron star orbital velocity .",
    "this means that the angular velocity of rotation of matter near the magnetosphere @xmath70 will be related to @xmath71 via _ m= _ b^n .",
    "( here the numerical factor @xmath72 takes into account the deviation of the actual rotational law from the value obtained by using the assumed power - law dependence near the alfven surface ; see appendix a for more detail . )",
    "let the ns magnetosphere rotate with an angular velocity @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the neutron star spin period .",
    "the matter at the bottom of the shell rotates with an angular velocity @xmath70 , in general different from @xmath11 . if @xmath75 , coupling of the plasma with the magnetosphere ensures transfer of angular momentum from the magnetosphere to the shell , or from the shell to the magnetosphere if @xmath76 . in the general case",
    ", the coupling of matter with the magnetosphere can be moderate or strong .",
    "in the strong coupling regime the toroidal magnetic field component @xmath77 is proportional to the poloidal field component @xmath78 as @xmath79 , and @xmath80 can grow to @xmath81 .",
    "this regime can be expected for rapidly rotating magnetopsheres when @xmath11 is comparable to or even greater than the keplerian angular frequency @xmath82 ; in the latter case the propeller regime sets in . in the moderate coupling regime",
    ", the plasma can enter the magnetosphere due to instabilities on a timescale shorter than that needed for the toroidal field to grow to the value of the poloidal field , so @xmath83 .",
    "let us first consider the strong coupling regime . in this regime ,",
    "powerful large - scale convective motions can lead to turbulent magnetic field diffusion accompanied by magnetic field dissipation .",
    "this process is characterized by the turbulent magnetic field diffusion coefficient @xmath84 . in this case the toroidal magnetic field ( see e.g. lovelace et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) is b_t=(_m-^*)b_p .",
    "the turbulent magnetic diffusion coefficient is related to the kinematic turbulent viscosity as @xmath85 .",
    "the latter can be written as _",
    "t=<u_tl_t>. according to the phenomenological prandtl law which relates the average characteristics of a turbulent flow ( the velocity @xmath86 , the characteristic scale of turbulence @xmath87 and the shear @xmath88 ) u_tl_t    largest scale of the energy supply to turbulence from the rotation of a non - spherical magnetospheric surface .",
    "this scale is determined by the velocity difference of the solidly rotating magnetosphere and the accreting matter that is still not interacting with the magnetosphere , i.e. @xmath89 , which determines the turn - over velocity of the largest turbulence eddies . at smaller scales a turbulent cascade develops . substituting this scale into equations - above , we find that in the strong coupling regime @xmath90 .",
    "the moment of forces due to plasma - magnetosphere interactions is applied to the neutron star and causes spin evolution according to : i^*=ds = k()k_2 where @xmath91 is the neutron star s moment of inertia , @xmath92 is the distance from the rotational axis and @xmath93 is a numerical coefficient depending on the angle between the rotational and magnetic dipole axis .",
    "the coefficient @xmath51 appears in the above expression for the same reason as in .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to positive flux of angular momentum to the neutron star ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the negative sign corresponds to negative flux of angular momentum across the magnetosphere ( @xmath95 ) .    at the alfven radius ,",
    "the matter couples with the magnetosphere and acquires the angular velocity of the neutron star .",
    "it then falls onto the neutron - star surface and returns the angular momentum acquired at @xmath5 back to the neutron star via the magnetic field .",
    "as a result of this process , the neutron star spins up at a rate determined by the expression : i^*=+z m r_a^2^ * where @xmath96 is a numerical coefficient which takes into account the angular momentum of the falling matter .",
    "if all matter falls from the equatorial equator , @xmath97 ; if matter falls strictly along the spin axis , @xmath98 . if all matter were to fall across the entire magnetospheric surface , then @xmath99 .",
    "ultimately , the total torque applied to the neutron star in the strong coupling regime yields i^*=k()k_2 + z m r_a^2^ *    using , we can eliminate @xmath8 in the above equation to obtain in the spin - up regime ( @xmath94 ) i^*= where @xmath100 is the corotation radius . in the spin - down regime ( @xmath95 )",
    "we find i^*=- .",
    "note that in both cases @xmath5 must be smaller than @xmath23 , otherwise the propeller effect prohibits accretion . in the propeller regime @xmath101 , matter does not fall onto the neutron star , there are no accretion - generated x - rays from the neutron star , the shell rapidly cools down and shrinks and the standard illarionov and sunyaev propeller ( 1975 ) , with matter outflow from the magnetosphere is established .    in both accretion regimes",
    "( spin - up and spin - down ) , the neutron star angular velocity @xmath11 almost approaches the angular velocity of matter at the magnetospheric boundary , @xmath102 .",
    "the difference between @xmath11 and @xmath70 is small when the second term in the square brackets in and is much smaller than unity .",
    "also note that when approaching the propeller regime ( @xmath103 ) , the accretion rate decreases , @xmath60 , the second term in the square brackets vanishes , and the spin evolution is determined solely by the spin - down term @xmath104 .",
    "( in the propeller regime , @xmath105 , @xmath95 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "so the neutron star spins down to the keplerian frequency at the alfven radius . in this regime ,",
    "the specific angular momentum of the matter that flows in and out from the magnetosphere is , of course , conserved .",
    "near the equilibrium accretion state ( @xmath107 ) , relatively small fluctuations in @xmath8 across the shell would lead to very strong fluctuations in @xmath1 since the toroidal field component can change its sign by changing from @xmath108 to @xmath109 . this property ,",
    "if realized in nature , could be the distinctive feature of the strong coupling regime .",
    "it is known ( see eg.g .",
    "bildsten et al .",
    "1997 , finger et al .",
    "2011 ) that real x - ray pulsars sometimes exhibit rapid spin - up / spin - down transitions not associated with x - ray luminosity changes , which may be evidence for them temporarily entering the strong coupling regime .",
    "it is not excluded that the triggering of the strong coupling regime may be due to the magnetic field frozen into the accreting plasma that has not yet entered the magnetosphere .",
    "the strong coupling regime considered above can be realized in the extreme case where the toroidal magnetic field @xmath77 attains a maximum possible value @xmath110 due to magnetic turbulent diffusion .",
    "usually , the coupling of matter with the magnetosphere is mediated by different plasma instabilities whose characteristic times are too short for substantial toroidal field growth . as we discussed above in section [ s_shell ] ,",
    "the shell is very hot near the bottom , so without cooling at the magnetospheric boundary it is marginally stable with respect to the interchange instability , according to the calculations by arons and lea ( 1976a ) . due to compton cooling by x - ray emission from the neutron star poles",
    ", plasma enters the magnetosphere with a characteristic time - scale determined by the instability increment . since the most likely instability is the rayleigh - taylor instability , the growth rate scales as the keplerian angular frequency @xmath111 .",
    "the time - scale of the instability can be normalized as t_inst= , the toroidal magnetic field increases with time as b_t = k_1 ( ) b_p(_m-^*)t_inst where @xmath112 is a numerical coefficient which takes into account the degree and angular dependence of the coupling of matter with the magnetosphere in which the angle between the neutron star spin axis and the magnetic dipole axis is @xmath113 .",
    "then , the neutron star spin frequency change in this regime reads i^*=k_1()k_2 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath5 [ ] and @xmath114 , the spin - down formula can be recast to the form i^*=z",
    "m r_a^2(_m-^ * ) here the dimensionless coefficient @xmath115 is z= ( , m_t ) ( 1+m_t^2 ) .    taking into account that the matter falling onto the neutron star surface brings angular momentum @xmath116 ( see above )",
    ", we arrive at i^*=z m r_a^2(_m-^*)+z m r_a^2^ * clearly , to remove angular momentum from the neutron star through this kind of a static shell , @xmath115 must be larger than @xmath96 .",
    "then the neutron star can spin - down episodically ( we shall precise this statement below ) .",
    "oppositely , if @xmath117 , the neutron star can only spin up .",
    "when a hot shell can not be formed ( at high accretion rates or small relative wind velocities , see e.g. sunyaev ( 1978 ) ) , free - fall bondi accretion with low angular momentum is realized .",
    "no angular momentum can be removed from the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "then @xmath118 and takes the simple form @xmath119 , and the neutron star in this regime can spin - up up to about @xmath82 independent of the sign of the difference of the angular frequencies @xmath88 at the magnetopsheric boundary . due to conservation of specific angular momentum , @xmath120 , so in this case the spin evolution of the ns is described by equation i^*=z m _ br_b^2 , where @xmath115 plays the role of the specific angular momentum of the captured matter .",
    "for example , in early work by illarionov & sunyaev 1975 @xmath121 . however , detailed numerical simulations of bondi - littleton accretion in 2d ( e.g. fryxell and taam , 1988 , ho et al . 1989 ) and in 3d ( e.g. ruffert , 1997 , 1999 ) revealed that due to inhomogeneities in the incoming flow , a non - stationary regime with an alternating sign of the captured matter angular momentum can be realized .",
    "so the sign of @xmath115 can be negative as well , and alternating spin - up / spin - down regimes can be observed .",
    "such a scenario is frequently invoked to explain the observed torque reversals in x - ray pulsars ( see the discussion in nelson et al .",
    "we repeat that this could indeed be the case for large x - ray luminosities @xmath122  erg / s when a convective quasi - hydrostatic shell can not exist due to strong compton cooling near the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "when a hot shell is formed ( at moderate x - ray luminositities below @xmath123  erg / s , see below ) , the angular momentum from the neutron star magnetosphere can be transferred away through the shell by turbulent viscosity and convective motions .",
    "so we substitute @xmath70 from into to obtain i^*= zm _",
    "b r_b^2 ^ 2-n - z(1-z / z)m r_a^2^*. this is the main formula which we shall use below . to proceed further ,",
    "however , we need to determine the dimensionless coefficients of this equation . in the next section we shall find the important factor @xmath56 that enters the formulae for both @xmath115 and @xmath5",
    ", so the only unknown dimensionless parameter of the problem will be the coefficient @xmath112 .",
    "the plasma enters the magnetosphere of the slowly rotating neutron star due to the interchange instability .",
    "the boundary between the plasma and the magnetosphere is stable at high temperatures @xmath124 , but becomes unstable at @xmath125 , and remains in a neutral equilibrium at @xmath126 ( elsner and lamb , 1976 ) .",
    "the critical temperature is : t_cr= here @xmath127 is the local curvature of the magnetosphere , @xmath128 is the angle the outer normal makes with the radius - vector at a given point , and the contribution of turbulent pulsations in the plasma to the total pressure is taken into account by factor @xmath129 .",
    "the effective gravity acceleration can be written as g_eff=(1- ) .",
    "the temperature in the quasi - static shell is given by , so the condition for the magnetosphere instability can then be rewritten as : =( , m_t )",

    "the comparison of these two timescales implies that at low velocities radiative cooling is important and the regime of free - fall accretion with conservation of specific angular momentum is realized .",
    "so , at low wind velocities the plasma cools down and starts to fall freely .",

    "we stress the difference of the critical acccretion rate @xmath269 from @xmath270 derived earlier . at @xmath271 ,",
    "the plasma rapidly cools down in the gravitational capture region and free - fall accretion begins ( unless photoionization heats up the plasma above the adiabatic value at some radius ) , while at @xmath272  g / s determined by a free - fall gap appears immediately above the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "the very slow rotation of the neutron stars in gx 1 + 4 , gx 301 - 2 and vela x-1 ( @xmath273 ) makes it hard to establish the propeller regime where matter is ejected with parabolic velocities from the magnetosphere during spin - down episodes .",
    "let us therefore start with estimating the important ratio of viscous tensions ( @xmath274 ) to the gas pressure ( @xmath275 ) at the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "this ratio is proportional to @xmath276 ( see ) and is always much smaller than 1 ( see table 1 ) , i.e. only large - scale convective motions with the characteristic hierarchy of eddies scaled with radius can be established in the shell .",

    "if the characteristic cooling time of the gas in the envelope is short in comparison to the falling time of matter , the shell disappears and one can expect the formation of a ` storaging ' thin keplerian disc around the neutron star magnetosphere ( sunyaev & shakura 1977 ) .",
    "there is no accretion of matter through such a disc .",
    "it only serves to remove angular momentum from the magnetosphere .",
    "the spectra of x - ray pulsars are dominated by emission generated in the accretion column .",
    "the hot optically thin shell produces its own thermal emission , but even if all gravitational energy were released in the shell , the ratio of the x - ray luminosity from the shell to that of the accretion column would be about the ratio of the magnetosphere radius to the ns radius , i.e. one percent or less . in reality",
    ", it is much smaller .",
    "the shell should scatter x - ray radiation from the accretion column , but for this effect to be substantial , the comptonization parameter @xmath167 must be of the order of one .",
    "the thomson depth in the shell is , however , very small . indeed , from the mass continuity equation and for the alfven radius and for the factor @xmath56",
    ", we get : @xmath279 therefore , for the temperature near the magnetosphere [ ] the parameter @xmath167 is @xmath280 this means that the x - ray spectrum of the accretion column should not be significantly affected by scattering in the hot shell .",
    "the large - scale convective motions in the shell introduce an intrinsic time - scale of the order of the free - fall time that could give rise to features ( e.g. qpos ) in the power spectrum of variability .",
    "qpos were reported in some x - ray pulsars ( see marykutty et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) . however , the expected frequency of the qpos arising in our model would be of the order of mhz , much shorter than those reported",
    ".    a stronger effect can be the appearance of a dynamical instability of the shell on this time scale due to increased compton cooling and hence increased mass accretion rate in the shell .",
    "this may result in a complete collapse of the shell resulting in an x - ray outburst with duration similar to the free - fall time scale of the shell ( @xmath281  s ) .",
    "such a transient behaviour is observed in supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) ( see ducci et al .",
    "this interesting issue depends on the specific parameters of the shell and needs to be further investigated .",

    "adiabatic gas outflows ( stellar winds ) were studied by parker ( 1963 ) .",

    "the quasi - static shell is capable of removing the angular momentum from the rotating magnetosphere via convective motions .",

    "remember that in the adiabatic case ( @xmath386 ) without turbulence at the saddle point we have simply u^2=c_s^2=. we stress that the presence of turbulence increases the velocity at the singular point .",

    "when cooling is slow , @xmath401 , the critical point lies inside the alfven surface , i.e. no transition through the critical point occurs in the flow before it meets the magnetosphere , and in this case we expect that the accretion settling regime can be realized .",
    "if this point lies abobe the alfven surface , the velocity of the flow can become supersonic above the magnetosphere , and one can expect the formation of a shock . both turbulence and rapid cooling shifts the location of the critical point upward in the flow .    in the case of rapid cooling , @xmath402 , @xmath403",
