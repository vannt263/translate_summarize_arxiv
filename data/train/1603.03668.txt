    "exactly solvable one - dimensional quantum models are widely used as proving grounds for key ideas in condensed matter physics and the theory of critical phenomena , since their conceptual simplicity often makes it possible to derive exact analytical expressions for the relevant physical quantities .",
    "historically , most of the work in this field has been focused on systems with short - range interactions , like the well - known heisenberg and ( quantum ) ising chains . in the last few years , however , it has become feasible to realize in the laboratory quantum spin chains featuring various types of long - range interactions through different experiments involving , e.g. , optical lattices of ultracold rydberg atoms and trapped ions , or neutral atoms in optical cavities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , with the help of hyperfine `` clock '' states of trapped @xmath5 ions it is now possible to simulate quantum spin chains in which the coupling  @xmath6 between the @xmath7-th and @xmath8-th sites is inversely proportional to a power  @xmath9 of their distance  @xcite .",
    "an important model of this type is the integrable haldane ",
    "shastry ( hs ) chain  @xcite , whose sites are the equispaced points  @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) on the unit circle with a coupling proportional to  @xmath12 . in fact , this chain is a limiting case of a more general model due to inozemtsev , in which the coupling @xmath6 is an elliptic function of the difference  @xmath13 with real period  @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "although the particles in the original  hs chain carried spin  @xmath15 , the model was shortly generalized to  @xmath16 spin without losing its remarkable integrability properties  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the  @xmath17 supersymmetric version of the hs chain , originally introduced by haldane  @xcite , has also been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the  @xmath18 hs chain ( with @xmath19 ) , since it is essentially equivalent to an  @xmath16 supersymmetric @xmath20-@xmath21 model  @xcite with exchange and transfer energies proportional to  @xmath12 .",
    "this chain , first introduced by kuramoto and yokoyama in the  @xmath22 case  @xcite , is an exactly solvable model which provides one of the simplest realizations of spin - charge separation .    in this work",
    "we introduce a wide class of @xmath0 supersymmetric spin chains with general translation - invariant couplings  @xmath23 and a chemical potential term . for zero chemical potential ,",
    "these models include in particular the supersymmetric elliptic chain studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and its two limiting cases , namely the @xmath0 hs chain and the xx model .",
    "the class of models under study are technically simpler than their @xmath18 counterparts , essentially due to the fact that they can be transformed into a system of free spinless fermions in a straightforward way .",
    "however , they still exhibit a sufficiently rich structure which makes it possible to examine a number of key properties in the theory of quantum critical systems in an analytic fashion .",
    "more precisely , our main objective is to study whether the models under consideration are quantum critical for suitable values of the chemical potential , and to determine their corresponding central charge . as is well known ,",
    "a characteristic feature of @xmath1-dimensional cfts is the fact that at low temperature  @xmath24 their free energy per unit length is approximately given ( in appropriate units ) by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant and @xmath27 is the effective speed of `` sound ''  @xcite . since the low temperature behavior of @xmath28",
    "is determined by the low - lying states of the theory , this should also be the case for any one - dimensional quantum system whose low energy spectrum is described by a @xmath1-dimensional cft . in particular , the determination of the low temperature behavior of the free energy of a one - dimensional critical model provides an efficient way of determining the central charge of its underlying cft . in this way we have been able to show that if the dispersion relation  @xmath4 is monotonic in the range  @xmath29 $ ] the models under study are critical when the chemical potential @xmath30 belongs to the open interval  @xmath3 , with central charge @xmath2 . as further confirmation of this result",
    ", we have studied the ground state entanglement entropy , i.e. , the entropy of the reduced density matrix of a block of @xmath31 consecutive spins when the whole chain is in its ground state .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in a @xmath1-dimensional cft the rnyi and von neumann entanglement entropies scale as  @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , where @xmath34 is the central charge and  @xmath35 is the rnyi parameter  @xcite .",
    "thus the entanglement entropy of a quantum critical one - dimensional system should be proportional to  @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where the proportionality constant fixes the central charge of the underlying cft .",
    "again , we have verified that when the chemical potential belongs to the open critical interval  @xmath3 the entanglement entropy of the models under consideration scales as that of a @xmath1-dimensional cft with  @xmath2 .",
    "we have also examined the behavior of the entanglement entropy and the zero - temperature fermion density as @xmath30 approaches the endpoints of the critical interval , showing that it is consistent with a quantum phase transition at both ends . for the @xmath0 chain with elliptic interactions",
    "we have studied numerically the fermion density at finite temperature , finding that its behavior is far more complex when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval .",
    "more precisely , for suitable values of @xmath30 inside this interval the fermion density is not a monotonic function of the temperature , but can rather present up to two extrema .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.model ]",
    "we introduce the class of supersymmetric spin chains with which this work is concerned , and recall how these models can be fermionized using the algebraic properties of the  @xmath0 permutation operator . in section  [ sec.tdc ] we analyze the thermodynamics of the general @xmath0 chain   when the dispersion relation is monotonic in the range @xmath38 , showing that at low temperature it behaves as a @xmath1-dimensional cft with @xmath2 . in section  [ sec.gsee ]",
    "we outline the computation of the von neumann and rnyi ground state entanglement entropies of the latter models in terms of the eigenvalues of the ground state correlation matrix .",
    "section  [ sec.asymp ] is devoted to deriving asymptotic formulas for these entropies , both when the size of the block of spins tends to infinity and when the chemical potential approaches the endpoints of the critical interval . in section  [ sec.fd ] we perform a numerical study of the fermion density of the elliptic  @xmath0 chain at finite temperature , and determine analytically its low temperature behavior for arbitrary interactions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec.sumout ] we summarize our conclusions and discuss some future developments suggested by the present work .",
    "consider a translation - invariant ( closed ) spin chain whose @xmath14 sites are occupied by either a boson or a ( spinless ) fermion .",

    "furthermore , we shall exclusively be concerned in this paper with _ closed _",
    "( i.e. , periodic ) chains , for which  @xmath64 .",
    "it is customary to extend the function  @xmath46 to the whole real line as an  @xmath14-periodic function , so that @xmath65    it was shown in ref",
    ".  @xcite that any chain of the form   can be recast into a model of spinless hopping fermions by identifying the boson state  @xmath49 with the fermion vacuum .",

    ", we have @xmath68 the chain sites can now be either empty ( i.e. , in the state  @xmath49 ) or occupied by a fermion ( in the state  @xmath50 ) , and thus the hilbert space is the whole  @xmath41-dimensional fock space built acting on the vacuum  @xmath69 with the operators  @xmath70 . as first shown by haldane  @xcite , from eqs .   and the constraints   it follows that the  @xmath0 exchange operator  @xmath47 admits the following simple expression in terms of the new fermion operators  @xmath71 : @xmath72 likewise , @xmath73 ( since @xmath74 is idempotent ) , so that  @xmath75 is simply the chemical potential for the new fermions .",
    "taking into account the latter identities , the hamiltonian   can be rewritten as @xmath76 where we have set  @xmath77 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "this hamiltonian describes a system of @xmath14 hopping ( spinless ) free fermions on a circle , with hopping amplitude between the @xmath7-th and @xmath8-th sites given by  @xmath78 and chemical potential  @xmath30 .",
    "the translation invariance of this model ( encoded in the periodicity of the function  @xmath79 ) suggests introducing the fourier - transformed operators @xmath80 it can be readily shown that these operators satisfy the car , and can therefore be considered as a new set of fermionic operators ; in fact , as we shall see below ,  @xmath81 creates a fermion with momentum  @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",

    "it easily follows from eq .   that if such a function  @xmath93 exists it is necessarily unique , and that @xmath95 .",

    "in this section we shall exploit the equivalence of the  @xmath0 supersymmetric chain   to the free fermion model   to analyze the critical behavior of this chain as a function of the chemical potential  @xmath30 . to this end",
    ", we first need to determine the ground state of the model  , which is straightforward from eq .  .",
    "indeed , it is obvious from the latter equation that the modes excited in the ground state are precisely those whose momenta @xmath82 satisfy the condition  @xmath120 , so that the ground state is nondegenerate . strictly speaking ,",

    "true , and it certainly holds for the dispersion relation   of the elliptic interaction   and , in particular , for the xx model and the @xmath0 haldane  shastry chains . if this is the case , it is straightforward to show that _ the model is gapless for  @xmath131$]_.     as a function of the mode number @xmath122 ( the range of modes excited in the ground state for the given  @xmath132 has been represented by a thick red line ) . ]    indeed , first of all it is clear that the system is gapped for  @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "for instance , for  @xmath133 the gap between the first excited state  @xmath135 and the ground state is @xmath136 , which remains positive as @xmath127 .",

    "the modes excited in the ground state are now those with @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where  @xmath144 denotes the integer part of @xmath139 ( cf .",
