    "as illustrated in the title of this conference , _ from 30-doradus to lyman - break galaxies _ , the term _ lyman - break galaxy _ ( lbg ) is almost synonymous with _",
    "high redshift starburst galaxy_. however , as has been stressed by many authors , including the lead researchers behind the lyman - break technique , current samples of lbgs consist of starbursts that are extremely luminous in the uv and do not give a complete census of all starbursts at high redshifts . the current magnitude limit in the ground based surveys for lbgs is r(ab)@xmath4 ( steidel et al .",
    "the luminosity function of lbgs has been extended to r(ab)@xmath5 based on data from the hubble deep fields ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "the faint end of this lbg luminosity function is very steep , with a slope @xmath6 , implying that more than 70% of the light is emitted by galaxies fainter than r(ab)@xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed at this conference , the most vigorous starbursts at high redshifts , e.g. as observed with scuba or with spitzer , are often obscured in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , chapman et al .",
    "2004 ) and often hence do not fulfill the selection criteria for lbgs .",
    "how is it then possible to locate and examine starbursts at high redshifts that are missed by the lyman - break technique ?",
    "one other method , not mentioned at this conference , is absorption selection of galaxies .",
    "the few galaxy counterparts that so far have been identified for damped ly-@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) , found in qso spectra , appear to be starburst galaxies with significantly smaller luminosities than lbgs ( e.g. , mller et al .",
    "2004 ; weatherley et al .  2005 ) .",
    "however , the total cross section of dlas at @xmath3 is much larger than what can be accounted for by lbgs .",
    "this implies that most of the neutral gas available for star formation at these redshifts is located in galaxies fainter than the lbg flux limit ( fynbo et al .",
    "other papers in these proceedings discuss the dust emission selected galaxies . here",
    "we will discuss _ i ) _ selection of ly-@xmath0 emitting starbursts through deep narrow band imaging , and _",
    "ii ) _ localisation of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies .",
    "the idea to use ly-@xmath0 to search for primordial galaxies dates back to the 1960s ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) .",
    "the first detection of redshifted ly-@xmath0 emission from galaxies not powered by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were serendipitous discoveries resulting from searches for galaxy counterparts of qso absorbers such as dlas and lyman - limit systems ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1991 ; mller & warren 1993 ; francis et al .  1996 ; fynbo et al .  2001 ; francis et al .",
    "other ly-@xmath0 emitters were serendipitously discovered during searches for intra - cluster planetary nebulae ( kudritzki et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this curiosity reflects the fact that for many years it was considered impossible to locate galaxies by their ly-@xmath0 emission as the probability for ly-@xmath0 photons to be absorbed by dust , due to resonant scattering , is much larger than for continuum photons .",
    "the first dedicated search for ly-@xmath0 emitters with 810 m class telescopes was conducted at the keck telescope ( hu et al .",
    "1998 ) .      in 2000 , some of the authors started the program `` building the bridge between damped ly-@xmath0 absorbers and lyman - break galaxies : ly-@xmath0 selection of galaxies '' at the european southern observatory s very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "this project is an attempt to use ly-@xmath0 selection to bridge the gap between absorption- and emission - line selected galaxies by characterisation of @xmath7 galaxies , possibly corresponding to the abundant population of faint ( @xmath8 ) galaxies associated to dlas ( fynbo et al .",
    "1999 ; haehnelt et al .",
    "the survey consists of very deep narrow band observations of three fields at @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in each of these fields ,",
    "we have detected and spectroscopically confirmed @xmath12 20 ly-@xmath0 emitters , or legos ( acronym for _ ly-@xmath0 emitting galaxy - building object _ ) . in fig .",
    "[ examples ] we show six examples of legos from the @xmath9 field . of the total sample ,",
    "85% are fainter than the flux limit for lbgs .",
    "furthermore , as only @xmath1325% of the lbgs have ly-@xmath0 emission lines with equivalent widths large enough to fulfill our selection criterion for legos ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is clear that lbgs and legos are almost disjunct classes of high redshift starbursts .",
    "ly-@xmath0 emitters from the `` building the bridge survey '' ( see fynbo et al .",

    "for this reason , we decided to observe a field with existing , very deep broad band observations covering most of the electromagnetic spectrum , namely the goods field south ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) . in 2002",
    "we obtained observations of a section of the goods field south . due to bad weather",
    ", we did not reach the same flux limit as for the `` building the bridge '' fields , but still we detected nearly 20 candidate @xmath11 legos in the field .",
    "the analysis of the broad band properties of these candidates constitute the thesis work of two of the authors ( b. krog and k. nilsson ) . here",
    "we report a few preliminary results .",
    "so far the objects have been studied in x - rays ( chandra x - ray observatory , 1 ms exposure ) , near - ir ( vlt / isaac ) , and the optical broad bands ( hst / acs ) . the hst images ( fig .",
    "[ goods ] ) confirm that the legos have extremely faint continua in the range v(ab)@xmath2029 .",

    "only upper limits were found in the x - ray and near - ir images so we can exclude that the galaxies harbour agn and significant older populations of stars .",

    "if the grb rate is directly proportional to the ( massive ) star formation rate , then the properties of grb hosts should reflect the diversity of all star - forming galaxies in terms of luminosity , environment , internal extinction and star formation rate .",
    "grb hosts therefore constitute a central clue for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; tanvir et al .",
    "2004 ; see also the papers by tanvir et al .  and trentham et al .  in these proceedings ) .",
    "the prompt burst of @xmath23-rays is followed by a so - called afterglow , emitting over a very wide spectral range from radio through the optical / near - ir to x - rays ( see van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 for a review ) .",
    "the afterglow can be extremely bright , allowing a precise localisation on the sky .",

    "taken at face value , this suggest that faint , lego - like galaxies in total account for the majority of the star formation at these redshifts",
    ". however , there could be other explanations for why grbs have , so far , mainly been localised in such galaxies ( fynbo et al .",
    "in particular , some of the so - called dark bursts could be located in more massive and dust - obscured galaxies ( e.g. , tanvir et al 2004 ; jakobsson et al .",
    "2004b and references therein ) . the recently launched swift satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) offers a unique chance to resolve this issue .",
    "in conclusion , surveys for legos and for grb host galaxies reveal that a major fraction of the starburst activity at @xmath2 may be located in galaxies fainter than the flux limit of the lbg survey . we have here shown that ly-@xmath0 emission and grb selection are two viable methods to probe this population of faint starbursts at high redshifts .",
