    "close binary systems ( cbss ) formed by a neutron star ( ns ) orbiting together with a normal donor star experience a mass transfer episode when the donor star undergoes roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) . since then on , stars are forced to exchange mass .",
    "a fraction @xmath3 of the transferred matter , carrying a substantial amount of angular momentum , is accreted by the ns , which becomes recycled and may reach spin periods in the millisecond range . in the standard treatment",
    "the initial rlof is a long standing episode ; the donor star transfers a large fraction of its mass and the orbit is sensibly affected . during rlof episodes ,",
    "a cbs can be detected as a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "for cbss with initial orbital periods @xmath4  day , after the end of the rlof , the pair may be observed as a radio pulsar with a binary companion , and almost no further orbital evolution is expected . within this general picture ,",
    "if we restrict ourselves to treat the case of stars that do not ignite helium , binary evolution predicts a tight donor mass - orbital period and @xmath5 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath6 relation (; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for cbss with @xmath4  day , standard calculations that lead to the formation of hewds predicts the occurrence of companions to radio pulsars only in the neighborhood of @xmath6 relation .",
    "currently , companions to radio pulsars more massive than predicted by the @xmath6 relation are considered as co or heco  wds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two separate classes of interacting binary systems with a radio pulsar have been identified , they are called redbacks and bws .",
    "redbacks are eclipsing binary systems with 0.1  day  @xmath7 1  day and @xmath8 .",
    "bws have @xmath9 in the same range of values , but much lower companion masses ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "standard cbs models do not take into account neither evaporation of the donor star by radio pulsar irradiation @xcite , nor x - ray irradiation feedback . during a rlof ,",
    "matter falling onto the ns produce x - ray radiation that illuminates back the donor star , giving rise to the irradiation feedback phenomenon . if the irradiated star has an outer convective zone , its structure is sensibly affected .",
    "studied irradiated grey atmospheres finding that the entropy at deep convective layers must be the same for the irradiated and non - irradiated portions of the star . to fulfill this condition ,",
    "the irradiated surface is partially inhibited to release energy emerging from its deep interior ; i.e. , the effective surface becomes smaller than @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the radius of the donor star ) .",
    "irradiation makes the evolution to depart from predicted by standard theory . after the onset of the rlof",
    ", the donor star relaxes to the established conditions on a thermal ( kelvin - helmholtz ) time scale , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath15 is the luminosity of the donor star ) . in some cases , the structure is unable to sustain the rlof , becoming detached .",
    "subsequent nuclear evolution may lead the donor star to rlof again , undergoing a quasi cyclic behavior .",
    "thus , irradiation feedback may lead to the occurrence of a large number of short lived rlofs instead of a long standing one . in between",
    ", the system may reveal itself as a radio pulsar with a binary companion .",
    "notably , the evolution of several quantities is only mildly dependent on the irradiation feedback ( e.g. , the orbital period ) .    on the other hand , evaporation of the donor star , due to radio pulsar irradiation",
    "affects the advanced evolution of cbss that eventually reach very short orbital periods .",
    "this effect makes the donor star to reach very low masses and makes these systems to achieve orbital periods large enough to be compatible with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is the aim of this work to explore the consequences of evaporation and x - ray irradiation feedback in the evolution of these cbss .",
    "as stated above , cbss undergo cyclic rlofs .",
    "this allow us to interpret that companions to radio pulsars more massive than predicted by the @xmath6 relation may also be progenitors of hewds or ultra short orbital period systems , observationally caught between two consecutive rlofs .",
    "this scenario provides a natural explanation for the occurrence of redback pulsars , as well as their evolutionary link with bws .",
    "the reminder of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : numeri ] we describe our numerical evolutionary code . in section  [ sec : resultados ] we present our models , while in section  [ sec : disc_concl ] we interpret and discuss these results and give some concluding remarks .",
    "we compute cbs evolution employing our code @xcite updated to include irradiation feedback and evaporation . during a rlof episode",
    "the code solves the structure of the donor star simultaneously with the instantaneous mass transfer rate @xmath16 , the evolution of both masses and the orbital semi axis in a _ fully implicit _ way .",
    "this strategy has the very desirable property of numerical stability that allows for the computation of mass transfer cycles (; @xcite ) presented in this letter .",
    "when the pair becomes detached , the code works following the standard henyey technique .",
    "let us remark some key assumptions in our calculations .",
    "we assumed that the ns accretes a fraction @xmath17 of the transferred matter up to the eddington critical rate @xmath18 , while very low accretion rates ( @xmath19 ) are prevented by the propeller mechanism @xcite .",
    "angular momentum sinks due to gravitational radiation , magnetic braking and mass loss from the system have been treated as in @xcite .",
    "irradiation feedback has been included following . the usual relation between luminosity , radius and effective temperature @xmath20",
    "is replaced , for the case of an irradiated photosphere by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath23 is the effective temperature of the non - illuminated part of the star , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the incident irradiating flux .",
    "we find @xmath27 by assuming that at the deep layers , the perturbations due to irradiation should vanish .",
    "we divided the irradiated part of the stellar surface in several sectors and solved for @xmath27 on each of them , and integrated over the illuminated zone .",
    "we have ignored any heat transfer between irradiated and non  -  irradiated zones .",
    "this imposes a limitation to the strength of the irradiation that our code can handle : @xmath28 .",
    "all our models are well below this limit .",
    "we assume that the ns acts as _ point source _ , releasing an accretion luminosity @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the mass , radius and accretion rate of the ns , respectively ) .",
    "considering isotropy , the energy flux incident onto the donor star is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the fraction of the incident flux that effectively irradiates the donor star and @xmath35 is the orbital radius .",
    "evaporation of the donor star due to radio pulsar irradiation is included by assuming a mass loss rate of @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the radio pulsar s spindown luminosity , @xmath38 is the escape velocity at the donor star surface and @xmath39 is an efficiency factor .",
    "@xmath37 is a function of the spin and moment of inertia evolution of the ns , that depend upon the free parameter @xmath17 .",
    "these quantities , as well as @xmath40 , are uncertain .",
    "so , as a first approximation we consider the product @xmath41 as time independent adopting a range of plausible values .    previous calculations @xcite indicate that evaporation is relevant for cbss with very short orbital periods only , especially after these cbss reach their minimum value . because of this reason , we considered evaporation since the minimum period is reached onwards .",
    "`` radio ejection '' may be relevant for these cbss .",
    "it has been proposed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that the pressure due to radio pulsar irradiation may inhibit material lost by the donor star to be accreted by the ns .",
    "if `` radio ejection '' operates , it precludes irradiation feedback to occur .",
    "in addition , we have neglected the presence of an accretion disk surrounding the ns . studied the evolution of ultracompact x - ray binary systems , considering an accretion disk , allowing for the occurrence of short time scales disk instabilities , modulating the long term evolution computed here . including `` radio ejection '' and/or accretion disks is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we computed cbss that initially have donor masses from 1.00  @xmath42 to 3.50  @xmath42 with steps of 0.25  @xmath42 ; a `` canonical '' ns ( @xmath43 ) ; and @xmath44 of 0.50 , 0.75 , 1.00 , 1.50 , 3.00 , 6.00 , and 12  days .",
    "we set @xmath45 for all calculations . at least for models without irradiation ,",
    "donor evolution is almost independent of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath46 , irradiation will be weaker and nss lighter . pulsed mass transfer is found for @xmath47 .",
    "thus , lowering @xmath17 should not change the behavior of the models qualitatively .",
    "we consider @xmath48 0.00 , 0.01 , 0.10 , and 1.00 ; and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "typical early evolutionary tracks are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks_irrad ] , while the evolution of @xmath16 for these cbss is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsos_mdot ] .",
    "as stated above , during mass transfer , cbss switch from accretion ( lmxbs ) to detachment conditions .",
    "the number of rlofs is strongly dependent on @xmath51 .",
    "the non  -  irradiated model ( upper panel of fig .  [ fig : pulsos_mdot ] ) behaves is an lmxb in almost the entire time period of fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsos_mdot ] .",
    "in contrast , irradiated models allow for its detection either as lmxb or radio pulsar with a companion ( see the other panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsos_mdot ] ) in detached state .",
    "while the number of rlofs is strongly dependent on @xmath51 , the duty cycle for detecting a lmxb or a radio pulsar is nearly constant . in the cases of @xmath52 and 1.00 , the cycles of mass transfer and detachments are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsos_mdot ] . for @xmath53 the average width of the cycle is @xmath54  myr on rlof and @xmath55  myr detached .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plano_masper ] we present the evolution of cbss together with available observed systems in the plane @xmath56 vs. @xmath57 .",
    "we restrict the data sample to those systems that contain one ns which have also undergone at least one rlof .",
    "those cbss should have suffered strong tidal dissipation , and their orbits should be almost circular .",
    "the radio pulsar data has been taken from the atnf data base @xcite , freire s page ( altough they correspond to other chemical abundances ) and fermi gamma ray sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if for a given object more than one data sample is available , we have plotted the larger value reported for the mass .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plano_masper ] , cbss with @xmath58  day evolve towards the @xmath6 relation .",
    "if irradiation feedback is considered , there are stages at which the cbs is detached while the track passes trough a region populated by several systems .",
    "cbss that do _ not _ reach bw region form a low mass , hewd .",
    "we found that during the whole unstable mass transfer cycle the donor stars almost fill their roche lobe .",
    "this is the result of the interplay between irradiation and orbital evolution .",
    "we call this donor stars state as quasi - rlof hereafter .",
    "this represents an alternative evolutionary status for these companion objects .",
    "a very recently detected redback system , psr j1723 - 2837 @xcite support these results .",
    "observations indicate that the roche lobe of the donor star is almost completely filled , as predicted by these calculations .",
    "to be sure , there are other paths to arrive to the right of the @xmath6 relation .",
    "these may actually be co , or heco wds ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results indicate that another quite different evolutionary path exists for these objects to occur .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zona_redbacks ] we show the redbacks region of fig .  [ fig : plano_masper ] , where we include all computed models together with the observed systems .",
    "redback systems with @xmath59  h should form a low mass hewd - radio pulsar system . for shorter @xmath9 , they are clearly bw progenitors .",
    "many evolutionary tracks converge , evolving to the bw region marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : plano_masper ] . in short , to become a bw it is necessary to have had characteristics similar to those of redback previously .",
    "nevertheless , not all redbacks evolve to bw .",
    "notice that , in the redbacks region of fig .",
    "[ fig : zona_redbacks ] , irradiated models undergo cyclic mass transfer ; so , we expect the detection of some binary systems as containing a radio pulsar .",
    "we find pulsed mass transfer at redbacks conditions for all considered initial donor masses and short @xmath9 values .",
    "again , pulsed mass transfer is found especially for @xmath60 , although it is also present for stronger irradiation regimes .",
    "another relevant item regarding redbacks and bw , is the mass of the underlying ns . a necessary condition for a cbs to become",
    "a redback is its short @xmath44 .",
    "for such cbss , mass transfer occurs at low rates .",
    "thus , most of the matter is accreted by the ns resulting significantly more massive . while the mass growth of the nss depends on @xmath17 , within the adopted assumptions we found redbacks with masses of 2.4  @xmath42 .",
    "this is consistent with recent reports ( @xcite ; @xcite ) claiming high ns masses for some bw .",
    "the bws region is reached by systems that evolved trough the redback region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plano_masper ] ) .",
    "evolutionary tracks with and without irradiation feedback are hardly distinguishable .",
    "however , this is not the case regarding evaporation .",
    "models without evaporation evolve at very low @xmath9 , in conflict with observations .",
    "evaporation makes the trajectories to bend up ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : plano_masper ] ) reaching the required range of @xmath57 values at ages shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "this is independent from the earlier operation of irradiation feedback , and should even occur if `` radio ejection '' prevents ns accretion .",
    "bw companions are semi  -  degenerate ; thus , evaporation makes the star to swell and the orbit to widen fast enough to detach from its roche lobe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the larger the @xmath61 , the steeper the trajectory .",
    "interestingly , bw companions become fully convective for @xmath62 independently of the evaporation rate .",
    "we computed the evolution of cbss formed by a ns ( behaving as a radio pulsar ) together with a normal donor star , for a range of donor masses for which we expect as a final product a low mass hewd or an ultracompact system .",
    "we included x - ray irradiation feedback and evaporation due to radio pulsar irradiation .",
    "these important ingredients allow for the occurrence of radio pulsars with companions in evolutionary stages at which donor stars are undergoing episodic mass transfers and almost filling their roche lobe ( the quasi - rlof state ) , being widely different from a wd star .",
    "this seems to fit the case of j1723 - 2837 @xcite which remains otherwise hard to interpret .",
    "we assumed that during rlofs , the ns acts as an x - ray point source .",
    "this represents the simplest configuration , but not the only possible one @xcite .",
    "for example , the x - ray flux may come from an accretion disk . in any case , a sequence of rlof and detachment cycles are expectable .",
    "notice that for all the values of @xmath47 considered here we find a cyclic behavior for the mass transfer .",
    "apparently , donor stars with convective envelopes are very sensitive to irradiation feedback , making the scenario presented here a robust one .",
    "this is so , provided `` radio ejection '' is not operative ; otherwise it would inhibit accretion onto the ns and irradiation feedback too , but evaporation should occur .",
    "part of our models evolve to redback conditions .",
    "this is so for the whole range of initial masses and short initial orbital periods ( @xmath63  day ) .",
    "for all the values of @xmath47 we find cyclic mass transfer episodes .",
    "a fraction of them form a low mass hewd , but others become bws progenitors . therefore ,",
    "our calculations indicate that all bws should have passed through the redbacks region ( although at such stage they are not necessarily classified as redbacks if eclipses are not seen ) .",
    "@xcite studied this problem , based on models including evaporation .",
    "they found that only fine tuning the evaporation rate for systems with @xmath64  h , it is possible to find bws as redback descendants .",
    "this result is very different from the scenario described by our models .    as stated in section  [ sec : resultados ] , some bws have been reported to harbour massive nss . in our scenario",
    "in which bws are redback descendants , we infer that the nss that behave as redbacks should be massive too .",
    "this is because most of the accretion onto the nss should have occurred previous to reaching redback conditions .",
    "we found cbss corresponding to redbacks with ns masses as high as 2.4  @xmath42 .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated a set of evolutionary tracks showing the relevance of irradiation / evaporation stages for interacting cbss .",
    "although other relevant ingredients may still be lacking , we believe there is enough evidence that a unified picture of the redback / bw evolution is closely related to the consideration of these physical effects , allowing an interpretation of present observational evidence .",
