    "considerable evidence has accrued for the past decade that large - scale structure in the universe grew via gravitational infall from a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of very nearly gaussian primordial adiabatic density perturbations @xcite .",
    "the nature of these perturbations is generally accounted for in terms of single - field slow - roll ( sfsr ) inflation @xcite . however , even if sfsr is the correct explanation , there might be new physics beyond sfsr inflation , and there remains the ever - present possibility that primordial perturbations are due to something completely different .    in order to develop a clearer understanding of the new physics responsible for primordial perturbations",
    ", we must be vigilant in seeking new fossils from the early universe in the form of subtle correlations in the matter distribution .",
    "this is the motivation for much of the work on non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "letter _ will explore new observables that can be sought with galaxy surveys .",
    "such work is timely given the advent in the forthcoming years of a new generation of surveys @xcite that will map the distribution of galaxies over vast volumes in the universe .",
    "recent work @xcite presented a parametrization of the most general autocorrelation function  which may depend on the orientation of the two points being correlated as well as their position in space  and showed that it could be decomposed into scalar , vector , and tensor components .",
    "here we generalize that work to the most general two - point _",
    "cross_-correlation function between two different galaxy populations .",
    "if primordial perturbations are gaussian , then the two - point correlation function is statistically isotropic and homogeneous . more generally , though",
    ", the two - point correlation function may , at least in some small region of space , be anisotropic .",
    "that anisotropy may also vary from one point in the universe to another .",
    "@xcite parametrized the most general local departure from isotropy for an auto - correlation function .",
    "since an auto - correlation function for two galaxies separated by a vector @xmath0 must be invariant under the inversion @xmath2 , the most general departure from statistical isotropy is parametrized in terms of a _ symmetric _ tensor , or more generally , in terms of the six degrees of freedom that parametrize that tensor .    if , however , we consider the two - point _ cross_-correlation function between two distinct populations , then it is possible that the correlation function for a galaxy pair separated by @xmath0 may differ from that with separation @xmath1 .",
    "there is thus a possibility that the two - point correlation function might `` point '' in a given direction , and this pointing is described by a vector .",
    "our purpose here is to point out that evidence of the imprint of a vector field can be sought with cross - correlatoins in the galaxy distribution .",
    "our work differs from that of refs .",
    "@xcite , who also considered asymmetric galaxy cross - correlations ; while they considered only those that arise from projection effects , we consider _ bona fide _ asymmetries in the three - dimensional distribution .",
    "since observations are done in redshift space , though , care must be taken to disentangle the 3d asymmetries we consider below from the redshift - space asymmetries discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and from the angular dependence induced by the 3d rsd operator  @xcite .",
    "below we describe the parametrization of the most general two - point cross - correlation , beginning by reprising the parameterization for the auto - correlation function .",
    "we then discuss the decomposition of these types of local departures from statistical isotropy in terms of two transverse and one longitudinal mode .",
    "next , we write down the optimal quadratic estimators to be constructed from galaxy surveys to detect these departures from statistical isotropy . after that , we discuss several possible physical mechanisms to generate these types of local departures from statistical isotropy .",
    "we begin this discussion with an effect that arises in biased halo clustering , even with gaussian initial conditions , and another that arises in halo clustering if there is local - type primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "we then describe several early - universe scenarios for such correlations .",
    "we point out that a search for these anisotropic cross - correlations may be used to seek a preferred cosmic direction correlated with the direction indicated by the hemispherical power asymmetry @xcite or to seek a preferred location associated with the cmb cold spot @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention the possibliity to construct new probes of parity breaking .",
    "we begin by reprising the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - point auto - correlation function .",
    "suppose we have a density field @xmath3 from which we construct the fourier components @xmath4 .",
    "the most general two - point correlation function for those fourier components can be parametrized as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a kronecker delta , and @xmath7 is a kronecker delta that sets @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 sums over the six possible basis tensors for a symmetric tensor , and @xmath10 are the six polarization tensors which can be written as a trace , a longitudinal mode , two transverse - vector modes , and two transverse traceless tensor modes .",
    "the @xmath11 are fourier amplitudes of the various types of perturbations , and @xmath12 parametrizes the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fossil ] ) indicates the statistically isotropic correlation with power spectrum @xmath16 .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , simply from symmetry considerations ( and in particular , the dependence of the correlation on the azimuthal angle about the direction of @xmath17 ) , that terms with the two scalar , the two vector , or the two tensor polarizations can arise in inflation if the inflaton is coupled to a new scalar , vector , or tensor field , respectively .",
    "our purpose here , though , is to consider the additional possibility that arises when we cross - correlate two different tracers of the matter distribution .",
    "the fractional density perturbations of these two populations will have fourier amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the most general two - point correlations of these fourier coefficients will satisfy a relation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : fossil ] ) , but the sum on @xmath9 will now be extended from six to nine to account for the three possibilities where @xmath20 is antisymmetric .",
    "the three new degrees of freedom in the cross - correlation , not allowed with auto - correlations , can be written most generally , for @xmath21 , as , @xmath22 here , the sum on @xmath9 runs over the three polarizations @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two other unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath26 and to each other . just from symmetry considerations",
    ", we expect that correlations with @xmath27 could arise if there is some longitudinal - vector field  or equivalently , the scalar field from which it is derived  coupled to whatever physics determines the galaxy distribution .",
    "similarly , distortions with @xmath28 would require that the galaxy distribution was determined , at least in part , by some transverse - vector field .",
    "( [ eq : newfossils ] ) describes , in fourier space , cross - correlations between two different populations , that are antisymmetric in the exchange of the two populations . in configuration space , these correlations trace out a vector field , as follows : in any small volume of the universe , the cross - correlation could `` point '' in some given direction ; i.e. , there could be a mean offset between galaxies of type 1 ( e.g. , more massive galaxies ) and galaxies of type 2 ( e.g. , less massive galaxies ) . this thus implies a preferred direction in that volume .",
    "the generality of the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newfossils ] ) allows for the possibility that this preferred direction is spatially dependent in such a way that global statistical isotropy is preserved on sufficiently large scales .",
    "it also allows for the possibility , though , for a preferred direction across the entire observable universe .",
    "this latter possibility clearly requires some exotic new physics , but the imprint of a _ local _ preferred direction is not at all exotic , as we will see .",
    "we now describe how to measure these vectorial cross - correlations from a galaxy survey .",
    "we will consider the longitudinal and transverse components separately and begin with longitudinal distortions , supposing that @xmath29 is specified .",
    "suppose further that the physical model specifies that the fourier components @xmath30 are selected from a gaussian distribution with power spectrum @xmath31 of amplitude @xmath32 and fiducial @xmath33 dependence @xmath34 .",
    "following the same steps as in ref .",

    "if instead we consider distortions of the transverse - vector type , then the optimal estimator for the amplitude @xmath46 for the power spectrum for the transverse - vector field will be as above , but with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath47 and an additional sum over the two transverse polarizations .",
    "we now show that asymmetric cross - correlations arise in the standard model for biased halo clustering from gaussian initial conditions .",
    "let @xmath3 be the primordial fractional mass - density perturbation , and suppose that this density field is populated by two different types of halos .",
    "these could be , for example , high - mass halos ( e.g. , those that house giant ellipticals , clusters , etc . ) and low - mass halos ( e.g. , those that house milky - way type galaxies , dwarf galaxies , etc . ) .",
    "let @xmath48 be the fractional perturbation in the number density , as a function of position @xmath49 , of halos of type 1 and similarly for @xmath50 . since the abundance of halos in some region is a nonlinear function of the local mass density , there are nonlinear relations @xcite , @xmath51 ^ 2+\\cdots$ ] and @xmath52 ^ 2+\\cdots$ ] between the halo and mass densities , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the usual linear - bias parameters , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are nonlinear - bias parameters .",
    "the nonlinear relation between @xmath57 and @xmath3 implies that there will be a three - point correlation , @xmath58       \\delta^d_{{\\mathbf{k}}_{123}}.$ } & \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\label{eq : biasedhaloclustering }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we antisymmetrize in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we find an antisymmetric part , @xmath59 $ ] to this three - point function .",
    "we now consider the squeezed limit , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , appropriate if we are considering the small - scale clustering of halos in the presence of a low - pass - filtered density field .",
    "the part of the bispectrum antisymmetric in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is then @xmath62 { \\mathbf{k}}\\cdot \\hat { \\mathbf{k}}$ ] .",
    "we thus see that in the presence of a long - wavelength mode of @xmath3 , the high - pass - filtered @xmath48 and @xmath50 have a fourier - space cross - correlation precisely of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newfossils ] ) with @xmath63(b_1 c_2 - b_2 c_1)(k / k)$ ] .",
    "the longitudinal , rather than transverse , mode is as expected in the presence of the long - wavelength density perturbation .",
    "existing measurements @xcite of nonlinear - bias parameters from galaxy bispectra @xcite have relied entirely on measurement of auto - correlations .",
    "cross - correlations have also been used to infer bias parameters @xcite , but those works considered only the linear bias . if a galaxy sample is broken up into two different populations , the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters for the two populations can be measured with the bispectra for the two different populations .",
    "the symmetric part of the cross - correlation between these two populations then provides a measurement of the combination @xmath64 , and the antisymmetric part of this cross - correlation provides @xmath65 .",
    "the latter provides some incremental improvement in statistical power , and it can also complement other measurements of the bias parameters and be used to check the validity of the biasing - model assumptions behind the analyses . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : biasedhaloclustering ] ) and what follows , we see that for a power - law @xmath16 , the ratio between the symmetric and asymmetric signals is @xmath66 , which is generically small in the squeezed limit @xmath67 .",
    "however , for populations with negative non - linear bias on certain scales ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) , it is certainly possible that the bias parameters contrive to yield @xmath68 , in which case the asymmetric information becomes particularly beneficial .",
    "asymmetry may arise even with linear biasing if there is primordial non - gaussianity of the local type . in this case , the linear - bias parameters for the two halo populations may be scale dependent , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 with the standard scale - independent bias @xmath72 and some collapse threshold @xmath73  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter - density perturbation is expected to develop a nonzero bispectrum @xmath74 due to nonlinear gravitational growth @xcite ( this should not be confused with the primordial bispectrum ) .",
    "the three - point function @xmath75 is thus noninvariant if we exchange @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and we again recover an antisymmetric correlation @xmath76 b(k_1,k_2,k)/p(k)$ ] , with f_l = 3(b_1-b_2 ) _ c f_nl_m .",
    "we now describe an exotic scenario that could give rise to an anisotropic two - point correlation .",
    "consider a curvaton - like inflation model in which primordial density perturbations are due not to fluctuations in the inflaton , but to fluctuations in some spectator field .",
    "suppose further that this curvaton - like field is complex and coupled to a new @xmath77 gauge field .",
    "there will then be charge - density fluctuations that arise during inflation , and if the @xmath77 symmetry is broken after inflation , those charge - density fluctuations may survive . it is then conceivable that dark matter may be like baryonic matter in our universe , in which there are light electron - like dark - matter particles and heavier proton - like dark - matter particles of opposite charge .",
    "if so , then galaxies that form in regions with a positive charge - density fluctuation may be different than those that form in regions with negative charge - density fluctuations .",
    "the cross - correlations between these two different types of galaxies  which for example may appear to us as brighter or fainter galaxies  should then trace out the large - scale electric - type field associated with the early - universe @xmath77 gauge field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : transversevectorfield ] ) .",
    "such a longitudinal - type cross - correlation could in principle be distinguished from that due to halo clustering from the different dependences on @xmath42 . unlike the halo - biasing case , in which small - scale directionality indicated by anisotropic cross - correlations are correlated with the long - wavelength density field",
    ", these anisotropic correlations would have no cross - correlation with the large - scale density field .",
    "what about anisotropic cross - correlations of the transverse variety ? as we have seen above , modulation of small - scale galaxy - density fluctuations by a long - wavelength density mode arise naturally , but those are of the longitudinal variety . any small - scale anisotropic cross - correlation that traced out a transverse - vector field would thus provide clear indication of new physics .",
    "there are indeed a number of inflationary scenarios that involve new vector fields @xcite and models of gravity in which the vector degrees of freedom in the metric are brought to life @xcite , and it is reasonable to surmise that one of these provide an imprint of the type we consider . to see how this may work ,",
    "suppose the inflaton ( or curvaton ) @xmath78 is coupled to a vector field @xmath79 through a term @xmath80 , where the parentheses in the superscripts indicate symmetrization ( antisymmetrization would make this term vanish ) .",
    "although the coupling of a mode of wavenumber @xmath17 of the vector field to two scalar - field modes of wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 would be symmetric under @xmath81 , one could again construct a model with two dark - matter components , sourcing two different galaxy populations in the respective dark matter halos made up from each component , in a way that makes the cross - correlation in one of the transverse directions asymmetric ( see illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : transversevectorfield ] ) .",
    "these transverse - vector cross - correlations will be straightforward to measure with a galaxy survey and any non - null result would be extraordinarily interesting .",
    "the measurement will also be useful as a unique null test for systematic effects .",
    "there is evidence for a hemispherical power asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and it is important to investigate whether this preferred direction shows up anywhere else . if the cmb power asymmetry is due to the long - wavelength modulation of primordial perturbations @xcite , then anisotropic cross - correlation of the type discussed above for biased halo clustering should exist , but with just one long - wavelength mode @xmath30 of wavenumber @xmath82 in the direction of the cmb power asymmetry . in simple terms",
    ", this fourier amplitude @xmath30 seeks whether a less massive galaxy is more likely to be found on one side of a more massive galaxy than on the other side .",
    "measurements from planck @xcite also confirm the existence of a cold spot in the cmb @xcite .",
    "an asymmetric cross - correlation that traces out a hedgehog configuration surrounding the cold spot could conceivably arise either from a large void @xcite or from exotic physics @xcite that may be responsible for the cold spot .",
    "a template for such a configuration could be constructed from the estimators @xmath39 discussed above .",
    "there are also novel probes of cosmic parity breaking that can be constructed .",
    "estimators for the two transverse modes @xmath11 for each wavevector @xmath17 can be constructed analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hlestimator ] ) by replacing the vector @xmath17 that appears in the dot product with one of the two transverse polarization vectors .",
    "those two linear polarization vectors @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be replaced by circular polarizations @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "estimators for the fourier amplitudes of these helicity states are then given by @xmath86 it is then straightforward , following the power - spectrum - amplitude estimators discussed above , to construct estimators to check for an asymmetry between the power in right and left circularly polarized modes .",
    "again , while a null result would not be too surprising , a positive result , if found , would be revolutionary .",
    "we have shown that cross - correlations between different galaxy populations may `` point '' in a given direction .",
    "the vector field from this pointing can be reconstructed from galaxy clustering , and it can be decomposed into longitudinal and transverse components , and also into components of positive and negative helicity .",
    "we discussed several physical mechanisms that may give rise to these departures from local statistical isotropy .",
    "these include nonlinear halo biasing , an effect that should arise in the standard model of halo clustering , and local - type non - gaussian primordial perturbations .",
    "other possiblities include couplings of the primordial field responsible for primordial perturbations to a new vector field , as well as a coupling to some field that might account for the hemispherical power asymmetry or cold spot in the cmb .",
    "the clustering effects from halo biasing constitute concrete predictions of the standard halo - clustering model that can be measured and used to test that standard model .",
