    "in this work , we have investigated the existence of stable  uncharged bps vortex configurations in the framework of an abelian maxwell - higgs model supplemented with cpt - even and lorentz - violating terms belonging to the gauge and higgs sectors of the standard model extension .",
    "our study has accounted two situations : the first one considered lv terms only in the gauge sector while the second case  regarded the full model . in both cases we have  restrained the investigation to uncharged topological solutions . in the first case , we have found the equations of motion and implemented the usual ansatz for static and rotationally symmetric vortex solutions . by applying the bogomolnyi method to the energy density ,",
    "the first - order bps equations were achieved , exhibiting a similar structure to the ones of the abelian maxwell - higgs model which supports the ano vortices .",
    "a numerical procedure was used to unveil the profiles of the bps vortex solutions .",
    "although the governing equations present the same structure , the liv parameter , @xmath91 , appears as a key element that allows us to control the thickness ( radial extent ) of the defect while spanning the available range @xmath169 : the larger is the value of the liv parameter , @xmath91 ; the narrower is the profile of the vortex , and vice versa . the intensity of the magnetic field increases with @xmath91 , tending to a maximal value when @xmath170 a limit in which the length of the defect and the interaction range tends to zero .",

    "@xcite ) , one should point out some advantages of the lorentz - violating compactlike solutions : the bps character , the preservation of the usual kinetic sector of the maxwell - higgs theory , and the direct correspondence between the defect thickness and the range of the interaction .",
    "moreover , this result opens a new window : the chance of employing models with lorentz violation as an effective theory to address some situations wherein _",
    "k_-field models have been applied ( see refs.@xcite ) , with special attention to topological defects .",
    "more specifically , the possibility of controlling the interaction range and the size of the defect may allow interesting applications to the investigation of vortex configurations in some condensed matter frameworks , where the penetration length depends on the properties of system .",
    "one should remark that the vortex solutions provided by eqs .",
    "( [ bps2 ] ) and ( [ bps1 ] ) do not exhibit space anisotropy , although the lv parity - even coefficients usually yield anisotropic stationary solutions ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the vortex ansatz selects only the parity - even solutions not endowed with space anisotropy .",
    "we still remember that the vortex configurations obtained in this lorentz - violating model are somehow equivalent to the ones yielded by the effective maxwell - higgs electrodynamics of ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes vortex configurations in a continuum medium .",
    "note that in this situation it does not make sense to consider vacuum upper bounds on the lorentz - violating coefficients , once the role of the lorentz - violating coefficient is to state the presence of the dielectric medium .",
    "this interpretation turns sensible the profile analysis performed in this work for the range @xmath171 , which obviously involves magnitudes much higher than the upper bounds usually stated , for example , in an electrodynamics in the vacuum .",
    "lastly , we have addressed the case where the lorentz violation is present in the higgs and gauge sectors simultaneously .",
    "the equations of motion were determined , being possibly compatible with bps equations defined in the context of a theory with two different vacua , each one supporting a definite vorticity solution .",
    "the energy density was carried out , revealing that only one of the higgs lv coefficients yields solutions with energy stability , so that we have adopted @xmath172  the remaining theory provides stable uncharged vortices ( with both vorticities ) in a unique vacuum .",
    "it has implied bps equations consisting of a modified duality relation and compatible with a new rotationally symmetric vortex ansatz .",
    "after an appropriated coordinate and field rescaling , such equations recover the bps equations of the first case ( with lorentz violation only in the gauge sector ) , leading to vortex solutions with similar profiles but different magnetic flux . in this case , however , the defect profiles are controlled by two lv parameters , @xmath110 and @xmath68 that play opposite roles on the spatial extension and the range of the interaction . for a fixed @xmath173",
    "we recover the same phenomenology described for the first case . for",
    "a fixed @xmath68 the size of the vortex should diminish with an increasing @xmath174 hence , we notice that @xmath110  and @xmath91  act as competing parameters , providing a larger control on the solution .  the crucial difference between the first and the second model is entailed with the new vortex ansatz * *  * * required to imply consistent solutions at origin",
    ". such difference engenders an interesting novelty : vortices with fractional magnetic flux , which is a feature of interest in condensed matter systems , as , for example , in recent models for superconductivity @xcite where the vortex solutions have a fractional structure . finally , we highlight that the fractional bps solutions are explicitly defined in the context of a modified vacuum theory , in accordance with eq.([vhg ] ) .",
    "the point is that in the presence of the lv - higgs parameters , the self - interacting fourth - order potential must be given as in eq .",

    "<S> we have investigated and verified the existence of stable uncharged bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) vortices in the framework of an abelian maxwell - higgs model supplemented with cpt - even and lorentz - violating ( lv ) terms belonging to the gauge and higgs sectors of the standard model extension . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed in two situations : first , one by considering the lorentz violation only in the gauge sector and then in both gauge and higgs sectors . in the first case , it is observed that the model supports vortices somehow equivalent to the ones appearing in a dielectric medium . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz violation controls the radial extension ( core of the solution ) and the magnetic field amplitude of the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortices , yielding compactlike defects in an alternative and simpler way than that of @xmath0field models . at the end </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the lorentz - violating terms in the gauge and higgs sectors . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the full model also supports compactlike uncharged bps vortices in a modified vacuum , but this time there are two lv parameters controlling the defect structure . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> an interesting novelty is introduced by the lv - higgs sector : fractional vortex solutions . </S>"
