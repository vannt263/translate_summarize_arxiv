    "thanks to recent advances in nanotechnology , various types of artificial low - dimensional semiconductor structures have been fabricated  @xcite .",
    "the quantum confinement of electron in these structures greatly modifies the density of states of carriers resulting in complete different electronic and optical properties from the bulk system  @xcite .",
    "recently one dimensional quantum wire and quantum - dot array have been manufactured in various ways  @xcite , and the formation of one dimensional miniband has been theoretically and experimentally investigated  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the van hove singularity of the density of state inherent with the one - dimensionality causes a characteristic electronic transport  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the charge transfer between an adatom localized state and a one dimensional miniband associated with a quantum wire or quantum - dot array .",
    "the charge transfer between an adatom and a substrate semiconductor has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the low dimensionality greatly modifies the charge transfer process from the adatom to the semiconductor quantum dot array due to the singularity of the density of states .",
    "the physical situation we consider in this paper is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) where an adatom is attached to a semiconductor quantum - dot array surface ( hereafter we simply call it a superlattice ) .",
    "the charge transfer of an electron from adatom to the miniband of the superlattice is caused by the hybridization of the adatom wave function with the miniband which can be described by the bilinear coupling between the adatom localized state and the bound state of a single quantum dot in which the adatom is situated .",
    "the situation may be described by one - dimensional version of newns - anderson model which has been extensively used to investigate the charge transfer process between the adatom and the semiconductor substrate  @xcite . as shown below",
    ", the one - dimensional newns anderson model we consider here is equivalent to the friedrichs hamiltonian which we have investigated in our previous letter  @xcite .    in this recent letter",
    "we reported a vast increase in the decay rate of an excited dipole molecule traveling in an one - dimensionally confined electromagnetic waveguide when the cutoff frequency of the waveguide is near the characteristic frequency of the dipole  @xcite .",
    "this vast increase is a direct consequence of a singularity in the density of photon states at the cutoff frequency . due to this singularity ,",
    "standard perturbation analysis breaks down and hence one can not apply fermi s golden rule to evaluate the decay rate in the vicinity of the singularity . we have shown that in this case the decay rate of the excited dipole depends non - analytically as @xmath1 on the coupling constant @xmath0 . in the present article , we report that the same nonanalytic enhancement of the decay rate ( including the @xmath1 law ) can be found in our system , despite the fact that the density of electron states of the miniband of the superlattice is different from the density of states of photon states in a waveguide .",
    "although the exponential decay law for the unstable state has been observed ubiquitously in nature , quantum mechanics predicts that there should be a deviation from the exponential decay law for the unstable state  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , irrespective of any specific form for the interaction , the time evolution of the surviving amplitude of an unstable state deviates from the exponential law on short and long time scales due to the existence of the lower bound on the energy , i.e. , the branch point effect .",
    "_ has recently succeeded in measuring the branch point effect in super - cooled sodium atoms  @xcite , even though the timescale in which the deviation from the exponential decay law appears is very short , thus separation of the pole and branch point effects in the time evolution of the unstable state is essential to our understanding of the decay process , as has been done for a system composed of an excited atom coupled to a radiation field  @xcite .",
    "the separation of the two effects is also useful because the reversible non - markovian process in the decay process ( due to the branch point effect ) is directly related to the quantum zeno effect  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to present an actual experimental method that enables us to separately evaluate the pole and branch point effects for the decay process of the unstable state in this system . in this article",
    ", we consider the optical absorption process in which a core electron of the adatom with discrete energy is transferred to the continuous conduction band .",
    "it will be shown here that the spectral shape is influenced by the markovian process due to the pole effect and also by the non - markovian process due to the branch point effect .",
    "the friedrichs model presented here is equivalent to that known as the fano model which was originally developed to explain the absorption spectrum for the autoionization process in the he atom  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this absorption spectrum has an asymmetric spectral profiles due to quantum interference between different optical transition paths .",
    "the appearance of the quantum interference indicates that the quantum coherence , which is a source of the memory effect , plays a key role in the decaying process of the excited state . as will be shown in the present paper , since the branch point effect which accounts for the non - markovian decaying process with a memory effect is intensified by the singularity in the density of states , the absorption spectral profile provides us with the information on the extent of the persistence of the quantum coherence in the decaying process .    in  2 we present the model and show the nonanalytic enhancement of the decay rate for the unstable state .",
    "we decompose the absorption spectrum into contributions from the pole and branch point effects in  3 . in ",
    "4 we summarize our results and provide some discussion .",
    "we consider a 1d semiconductor superlattice with an adatom on the surface , as shown in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the width of each potential well is a few nm to 100 nm .",
    "one can make this device , for example , with gaas / gaalas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "the superlattice consists of @xmath2 identical quantum wells , and each well is assumed to have a single bound state @xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath5 of equal energy , where the tilde is used to distinguish the site representation from the wavenumber representation below .",
    "a miniband is formed in the superlattice due to the electron tunneling through the potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "we assume only nearest neighbor tunneling occurs with a transition probability of @xmath6 .",
    "the 1d superlattice is then represented by the one - dimensional tight binding model , and we have a continuous miniband of width @xmath7 in the limit of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the miniband we consider an adatom localized state @xmath9 with energy @xmath10 ; also we consider an inner core level @xmath11 with energy @xmath12 .",
    "both of these states are associated with the adatom impurity located at the @xmath13 site .",
    "the adatom localized state @xmath9 is hybridized with the @xmath14 state with coupling strength @xmath15 .    taking @xmath16 hereafter , the electronic hamiltonian @xmath17 is then written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 means taking nearest neighbor sum in eq.([helectron ] ) . by introducing the wavenumber representation @xmath20|\\tilde{n}\\rangle   \\;,\\ ] ] we can rewrite @xmath17 in the form of the friedrichs model @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    ", it is readily seen that the solutions are symmetric about the origin @xmath44 . by applying the standard method for solving a quartic equation",
    ", one can find the explicit solutions of the dispersion equation @xmath45 .",
    "the solutions consist of the pole @xmath46 of @xmath47 in the lower half complex plane in the second riemann sheet corresponding to the unstable decaying state , and the poles on the real axis corresponding to the stable states , @xmath48 . for illustration ,",
    "we plot in fig.[fig2](a ) @xmath49 and @xmath31 for @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 with thick dashed and solid lines , respectively . for arbitrary @xmath10 , there always exist two stable solutions outside the electronic miniband . note that there is a critical value @xmath52 at which the unstable state with imaginary part @xmath53 appears .",
    "the unstable state exists for all @xmath54 , as indicated by the arrows in fig.[fig2](a ) . in fig .",

    "the maximum value of @xmath57 occurs at @xmath58 .",
    "since the explicit form of the full solution is complicated , we present an approximate calculation of the maximum value @xmath59 of @xmath60 at @xmath61 and the critical value @xmath52 of @xmath10 where the unstable solution appears . to estimate @xmath59 we put @xmath62 in the dispersion equation .",
    "after a simple manipulation we obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 . the zeroth order solution ( for @xmath65 )",
    "is @xmath66 .",
    "we use this as our starting point and solve iteratively to find @xmath67 where the third order contribution ( @xmath68 with @xmath69 ) vanishes .    to estimate @xmath52 near @xmath70",
    "we put @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are unknown variables which are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "then , by keeping only the predominant contribution to the dispersion equation , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 . squaring this equation yields @xmath76 the function",
    "@xmath77 represents a cubic curve . by taking the derivative of @xmath77 and setting @xmath78",
    ", we find the threshold value of @xmath79 at which the complex solutions of @xmath80 appear .",
    "this leads to the first two terms in the following expression for @xmath52 : @xmath81 for precision , we have presented the second order correction that is obtained from the exact solution of the original quartic equation .",
    "the values of @xmath60 and @xmath52 are non - analytic in @xmath0 for @xmath65 , and hence one can not obtain these results from a series expansion in @xmath0 using ordinary perturbation analysis .    it should be noted that the @xmath1 law for the decay rate is rather universal around the edge of the continuous spectrum . indeed , if the integration over the wavenumber in the self - energy is a cauchy integral that is a double - valued function on @xmath43 , as is the case in eq.([eta ] ) , then the edge of the miniband will give a square root type of essential singularity in the self - energy .",
    "in addition , if this singularity leads to a divergence at the edge , one can show that the @xmath1 effect appears in the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "indeed , this is also the case for the dipole molecule traveling inside the waveguide mentioned above  @xcite .    in terms of the solutions of the dispersion equation obtained here",
    ", we may evaluate the time evolution of the surviving amplitude of the adatom localized state defined by @xmath82 | d\\rangle \\right|^2 $ ] .",
    "indeed , aside from the persistent oscillation attributed to the two stable states , there are two contributions to the time evolution of the surviving amplitude ; one comes from the pole contribution over the wavenumber integral , where the location of the pole is given by the solution of the dispersion relation @xmath83 in the complex @xmath33 plane discussed above , and the other comes from the two branch point contributions that are located at the edges of the miniband at @xmath84 . as usual , the pole contribution leads to an exponential decay @xmath85 $ ] , while the branch point leads to a power law decay .",
    "if the condition @xmath86 is satisfied , we have a well separated time scale between the exponential and power law decay in the decay process of the localized state .",
    "the exponential law for the decay process is thus a good approximation for a time scale on the order of @xmath87 .",
    "however , once this condition is no longer fulfilled , the time separation becomes obscure and we must take into account the branch point effects in the time evolution .",
    "it is , however , a cumbersome task to evaluate the integral associated with the branch point in the time evolution . in the next section , we will evaluate the optical absorption spectrum instead , to separate the contribution of the markovian effect from the non - markovian effect",
    ". it should be generally easier in experiment to observe the absorption spectrum than a time evolution of the state @xmath88 .",
    "here we consider the optical absorption by a transition from an inner core level of the adatom to the conduction electronic states of the 1d semiconductor superlattice , as shown in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "there are two optical transition paths from the core level @xmath89 with large transition amplitudes : one is that from the core level @xmath90 to the localized state @xmath9 and the other is from the core level @xmath90 to the @xmath91 site @xmath14 .",
    "the transition probabilities are denoted by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the contributions of the transitions to the other bound states @xmath3 are small , so we neglect the contributions in this paper , though it is not difficult to include those effects .",
    "we consider here a single mode of the optical light field with frequency @xmath94 .",

    ", we have a core electron in the @xmath90 state and a single photon with energy @xmath94 ; we write this initial state as @xmath100 with energy @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes the photon number for the mode @xmath94 . after the absorption process",
    "the energy of the photon is transferred to the electronic system .",
    "the final states then take the form @xmath103 @xmath30 or @xmath104 , with the energies @xmath31 or @xmath33 respectively .",

    "hereafter we take @xmath109 as the origin of the light energy : @xmath110 .    the decay rate of @xmath100",

    "therefore the spectral width of @xmath151 gets wider and the shift of the peak position from @xmath10 becomes visible as shown in fig.[fig4](b ) .",
    "furthermore , it is found from eq.([nd]b ) that the divergence in the density of states enhances the second term in eq.([nd]b ) , and thus @xmath131 is largely reduced from 1 while @xmath158 $ ] remains negligibly small . consequently , the relative ratio of the branch point contribution of @xmath152 to the pole contribution @xmath151 becomes larger than in fig.[fig4](a ) .",
    "as discussed at the end of the previous section , the relative increase of the branch point contribution indicates that the time separation between the exponential and the power law decays becomes obscure in the time evolution of the surviving amplitude .",
    "therefore , the non - markovian process with memory effect becomes significant , which maintains the quantum coherence in the decaying process .",

    "we have demonstrated that the absorption spectrum from the inner core level of the adatom to the conduction states is an appropriate probe to observe both contributions . while the branch point effect is usually small , it becomes important when the adatom localized state is resonant with the miniband of the 1d superlattice in the vicinity of the singularity in the density of states . in the case where the branch point effect is significant",
