    "the recent development in strong - field physics has opened wide perspectives for observing the structure and ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms and molecules with ngstrm and attosecond resolutions @xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating topics at the frontier of this area is the molecular orbital tomography ( mot ) based on high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , which was first proposed by j. itatani _ et al _ in @xcite . by applying this method to a series of aligned molecules",
    ", they accomplished a tomographic reconstruction of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of n@xmath0 .",
    "since then , the mot has attracted a great deal of attention for its great significance in uncovering the basic properties of molecules and chemical reactions @xcite . in most of the works ,",
    "the target molecular orbitals are symmetric with either gerade or ungerade symmetry , while the mot of nonsymmetric orbitals is more difficult .",
    "it has been discussed by van der zwan _",
    "et al _ @xcite that the mot of orbitals with arbitrary symmetry requires one to restrict the recollision of the continuum electrons to only one side of the core in the hhg process @xcite .",
    "therefore , they suggested using extremely short few - cycle laser pulses to ensure the one - side - recollision and the molecular orbital of heh@xmath2 was successfully reconstructed in their simulation . besides , one can also consider using an @xmath3 two - color laser pulse for the mot of nonsymmetric orbitals @xcite .",
    "in addition to the arbitrary symmetry , another important characteristic of the nonsymmetric orbital is the permanent dipole .",
    "as a large permanent dipole would lead to an unnegligible stark shift of the orbital energy , it would have influence on the mot in two aspects .",
    "firstly , it will cause additional laser - induce stark phase acquired in the hhg of the nonsymmetric orbital . as the phases of field - free dipole matrix elements are needed in order to reconstruct molecular orbitals",
    ", one has to find a way to subtract the stark phase from experimental measurements .",
    "the method is found in @xcite , in which the authors derived an analytical expression of the first - order stark phase only depending on the measurable quantities .",
    "secondly , previous works have shown that the stark shift of the orbital energy can efficiently modify the angular dependence of the ionization rate and the distribution of the ionized electrons @xcite .",
    "this effect will make it more complicated to control the continuum electron for one - side - recollision and to reconstruct the orbital .",
    "this influence has however not been discussed before to the best of our knowledge and requires more concerns .",
    "moreover , the influence of the nonsymmetric electron distribution on the reconstructed result in mot has not been extensively discussed and calls for more studies too .    in this paper",
    ", the influence of large permanent dipoles on the mot of nonsymmetric molecular orbital is investigated .",
    "it is found that , the one - side - recollision condition in hhg can not be satisfied even with the few - cycle laser pulses , owing to the modification of the angle - dependent ionization rate induced by the stark shift .",
    "we employ a tailored laser pulse to overcome this problem and the orbital reconstruction is carried out in both the length and velocity forms .",
    "the reconstructed results are compared to the _ ab initio _ orbital and the influence of the nonsymmetric electron distribution on the reconstructed result in mot is discussed at the end .",

    "in the second part , we compare and discuss the reconstructed results in different forms and by using different projected components of the dipole matrix elements .",
    "in this work , we apply co as the target molecule .",
    "the homo of co has a large permanent dipole of 1.72 a.u . pointing from c to o nucleus .",
    "the ionization energy of co is 0.5152 a.u . , and",
    "the reference atom is kr with the ionization energy of 0.5145 a.u .",
    "we apply a linearly polarized three - cycle sin@xmath64 driving pulse @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the optical cycle and @xmath67 .",
    "this form of laser pulse ( with an opposite sign ) has been used to accomplish the mot of the nonsymmetric molecule heh@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the intensity and wavelength of the laser pulse we use are @xmath68 w / cm@xmath64 and 1.5 @xmath70 m respectively .",
    "employing the 1.5 @xmath70 m mid - ir laser source allows us to extend the harmonic spectrum considerably with a low laser intensity below the barrier suppression intensity @xcite , which ensures the validity of the used mo - adk model and strong - field approximation ( sfa ) in our theoretical description .",
    "another benefit of keeping the intensity low is that it will reduce the effect of the stark shift .",
    "t1 trajectory returns to the core from + x position with a negative momentum , while the electron of p2@xmath71t2 trajectory returns from the -x side with positive momentum .",
    "( b ) the time - dependent orbital energy @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively.,width=396 ]    the electric field of the driving pulse is depicted by the dashed blue curve in fig .",
    "the hhg process is also illustrated by the black arrows in fig .",
    "2(a ) : under this three - cycle laser pulse , the hhg is dominantly contributed by the electrons ionized by the two peaks p1 and p2 . for the electrons ionized by p1",
    ", they first drift towards the positive direction and finally return to the core at times around t1 with negative momenta , emitting the high - order harmonic photons . on the contrary , the electrons ionized by p2 finally return to the core at times around t2 with positive momenta .    when the effect of the permanent dipole of co is ignored , the ionization energy is constant .",
    "the ionization probabilities in the + x and -x directions are dominantly determined by the waveform of the electric field , due to the exponential dependence of the tunneling ionization rate on the amplitude of electric field .",
    "therefore , as the maximum amplitude of p2 is bigger than that of p1 , electrons are more easily to be ionized by the p2 peak and the high - order harmonic radiation will be stronger at t2 than at t1 .",
    "this is confirmed by our calculation shown in the first row in fig .",
    "( 3 ) . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the red and green solid curves show the x and y components of the high - order harmonic spectrum from co oriented at @xmath73 without taking into account the stark shift . the harmonic spectrum from the reference atom is also shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) by the dashed curve . figures 3(b ) and ( c ) show the corresponding time - frequency analyses @xcite of the molecular hhg in the parallel ( x ) and perpendicular ( y ) directions respectively .",
    "it is found that the atomic spectrum exhibits double - plateau structure , while only the plateaus on the lower energy side are observed in the molecular spectra .",
    "this is because the plateaus on the higher energy side are so weak as to be below the background noise .",
    "the result implies that the plateaus on the lower energy side are at least 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than those on the higher energy side in both x and y components in the spectrum from co. according to the time - frequency analyses , the plateaus on the lower energy side are mainly contributed by the q2 peaks , which are generated by the recollision of electrons with positive momenta at t2 . while the plateaus on the higher energy side are contributed by the q1 peaks , which are generated by the recollision of electrons with negative momenta at t1 . from both the observations in the spectra ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) that the plateaus on the lower energy side are much higher than those on the higher energy side and in the time - frequency distributions ( figs .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) ) that q2 are much stronger than q1 , it can be concluded that the high - order harmonics are generated by the recollision of electrons from only one side .",
    "( intensity).,width=491 ]    however , when the stark shift is considered , the one - side - recollision condition is worse satisfied . as shown in figs .",
    "3(d ) , the plateaus on the higher energy side appear and are in the same level with the plateaus on the lower energy side in the harmonic spectra of co in both components . the time - frequency analyses also show that the peaks q1 and q2 have comparable intensities .",
    "it has been discussed that q1 is generated by the electrons with negative return momenta and q2 is generated by the electrons with positive momenta .",
    "therefore , the results indicate that the electrons with both negative and positive momenta have comparable contributions to the hhg .    to explain why the stark shift makes the one - side - recollision condition worse satisfied , the time - dependent orbital energy @xmath72 in response to the external electric field @xmath75",
    "is plotted in fig 2(b ) .",
    "the electron is more likely to be ionized with a high @xmath76 and is harder to be ionized when @xmath76 is low .",
    "therefore , the ionization rate of co is decreased when @xmath77 is parallel with the electric filed @xmath78 and is increased in the antiparallel geometry . in the case of 10@xmath79 orientation , as shown by the red solid curve in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the ionization by p1 is enhanced by the stark shift and the ionization by p2 is suppressed , leading to the comparable ionization probabilities from both peaks . and these comparable ionization probabilities finally lead to the comparable hhg contributions by electrons returning from opposite sides",
    ".        as the mot requires extracting structure information ( the slices ) of the target orbital from different directions , the one - side - recollision condition should be satisfied at various orientation angles . to evaluate the ratio between the probabilities that an electron returns to the core with negative and positive momenta at different angles , a semi - classical method introduced in @xcite is used .",
    "first of all the electrons are tunneling ionized with the probability calculated by the mo - adk theory .",
    "after ionization , the freed electron follows a classical trajectory , and we collect the electrons which finally return to the core .",
    "every classical return receives a weight based on the ionization probability and a factor of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the time the electron spends in the continuum from ionization to recombination and reflects the effect of wave - packet spreading . after the collection ,",
    "the return probability of the electron with negative momentum @xmath82 and the return probability of electron with positive momentum @xmath83 are obtained .",
    "the ratio of the probabilities @xmath84 for orientation angles from 0@xmath79 to 180@xmath79 is plotted in fig .",
    "4 , where the blue circles and the green diamonds present the calculated results without and with the stark effect taken into account respectively . comparing the green diamonds to the blue circles",
    ", the stark shift leads to more recollision with negative momentum especially for the orientation at small angles .",
    "the ratio of @xmath84 is bigger than 0.1 for @xmath85 and goes up to bigger than 1 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    to overcome this problem",
    ", one may first think of using an even lower intensity for the driving pulse to further reduce the effect of the stark shift . however",
    ", too low intensity will bring the problem of a bad signal to noise ratio .",
    "instead , in previous experimental and theoretical works higher intensities than 1@xmath88 w / cm@xmath64 were preferred , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "therefore , in this work we suggest a method to solve this problem by using a tailored laser pulse with the relatively high intensity .",
    "the tailored laser pulse is synthesized by adding a weak low - frequency laser field to the few - cycle laser field .",
    "the low - frequency field can be provided by different kinds of light sources such as the co@xmath0 laser @xcite and the thz radiation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of adding this assistant field is to enlarge the difference between the amplitudes of p1 and p2 . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the low - frequency pulse from co@xmath0 laser with the wavelength of 10.6 @xmath70 m .",
    "the intensity of this pulse is 1% of that of the few - cycle driving pulse and the electric field is @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",

    "the values in the color bar correspond to @xmath92(intensity).,width=491 ]    the ratio @xmath84 under this tailored field is presented by the red pentagrams in fig .",
    "4 . comparing to the green diamonds , the recollision with negative momentum is suppressed : the ratio is two orders of magnitude decreased and is below 0.1 for all the orientation angles ( for @xmath93 the ratio at @xmath39 equals that at @xmath94 ) .",
    "the result shows that the tailored laser pulse can efficiently restrict the recollision of the continuum electrons to only one side of the core .",
    "the high - order harmonic spectra at three typical orientation angles 10@xmath79 , 90@xmath79 and 170@xmath79 calculated with the quantum model described in section 2.1 are shown in the first column in fig .",
    "5 . the second and third columns present the time - frequency analyses of the molecular harmonic spectra in the x and y components respectively . these results are consistent with those from the semi - classical method .",
    "the peaks q2 are much stronger than q1 in all the time - frequency distributions . regarding the molecular harmonic spectra , the plateaus on the lower energy side ( predominantly contributed by electrons with positive momenta ) are 3 - 4 orders higher than those on the higher energy side ( contributed by electrons with negative momenta ) at @xmath73 as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) . and the plateaus on the lower energy side are at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than those on the higher energy side for @xmath95 and @xmath74 as shown in figs .",
    "5(d ) and ( g ) .",

    "( 6 ) . to reconstruct the orbital",
    ", we use the odd harmonics from the 23rd to the 79th orders ( corresponds to 19 - 65 ev ) generated from co at @xmath39 from 0@xmath79 to 360@xmath79 with the angular step @xmath97 .",
