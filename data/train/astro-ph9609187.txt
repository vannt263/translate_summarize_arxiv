    "a decade after paczynski s ground - breaking proposal ( 1986 ) several teams and considerable resources around the world are now devoted to searches for microlensing events [ see recent overviews by paczynski ( 1996 ) and roulet & mollerah ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "these searches have been rewarded by by a large number ( @xmath8 ) of detections in the direction of the galactic bulge and already a significant set of events observed [ 1 or 2 by the eros team @xcite and 6 - 8 by the macho team @xcite ] along the line of sight to the large magellanic cloud .    in the latter case microlensing",
    "is expected to provide us with direct information on the composition of the galactic halo .",
    "a statistical analysis @xcite of the presently available data suggests that dark massive objects  the potential microlenses  could account for between 30% and 100% of the total mass in the halo .",
    "in addition , their most likely masses should be in the range 0.1 - 0.6@xmath9 .",
    "the admittedly large uncertainty stems in part from the still small number of events and thus a poor statistics , but also from our lack of knowledge [ as made clear in @xcite ] regarding the spatial distribution and kinematics of the massive halo objects ( mho ) .",
    "the import of the halo structure is due to the simple fact that the ( inferred ) mass of a lens scales as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the _ observed _ duration of the microlensing event , @xmath12 is the mho s velocity orthogonal to the line of sight , @xmath13 is the earth - lens distance and @xmath14 is the earth - source distance . at the same time , the integral event rate which is roughly proportional to @xmath15 obviously incorporates details about halo beyond the mere total mass @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the conversion from the observed quantities , the event durations and the rate , to information on mhos masses and their halo s total mass inevitably involves assumptions about the structure of the halo .    a question arises at this point : should we expect  as might seem only natural  that , given a larger number of detections in a foreseeable future , the determination of the mho mass function and the mhos fraction of the total halo mass could reach a significantly higher accuracy thus providing us with better clues regarding the origin and evolution of the halo .",
    "the present paper will address this question .    recently",
    "mao and paczynski ( 1996 ) studied the issue of mhos mass determination . by considering simplified ` toy ' models ( e.g. , uniform spatial density of mhos ) they were able to estimate that a reliable determination of the mass function could be achieved if we had 100 or more events .",
    "they modeled the mass function by a simple power law @xmath17 ( as we shall do in this paper ) and concluded that for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) the high ( low ) mass end of the mass function will be difficult to probe . as they pointed out , their results depended on the assumption that the mhos spatial distribution and kinematics were known .    in this paper",
    "we also at first assume that the halo model is known .",
    "the specific model used in section 4 for the purpose of mass function inference is the isothermal sphere with a core ( cis ) .",
    "although the underlying halo model is considerably more realistic in our case , the basic conclusion of mao and paczynski remains valid : in the vicinity of @xmath1 the slope and range @xmath20 can be determined with @xmath21 events .",
    "however , as we shift away from @xmath1 , the error of determination grows very rapidly .",
    "in particular , for a positive slope @xmath22 one needs @xmath23 events for a reliable inference .",
    "[ it is to be hoped  perhaps not unrealistically  that the actual mass function of the mhos will indeed correspond to @xmath22 sufficiently close to -1.5 . ]",
    "a quantity that can be accurately ( @xmath24 error ) inferred with @xmath21 at any slope is the average mass of the mhos , i.e. , the first moment of the mass function .",
    "we find that our results do not depend dramatically ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "6 ) on whether the detection efficiency is flat ( i.e. independent of event duration ) or of the type presently available for the macho project s microlensing searches @xcite .    the effects of halo structure uncertainty will receive our attention in the later part ( section 5 ) of the paper . at the outset of section 5",
    "we will perform the following ` experiment : ' we will assume that a specific spherical halo model describes the actual halo accurately enough ( this model will be called the ` real ' one ) .",
    "we will then ask what the effect on mass function and mhos halo fraction determination is if , instead of the ` real ' model , we use for the inference a different one , the isothermal sphere ( chosen here in its singular , @xmath25 , version ) .    for the ` real ' model",
    "we take a ` concentrated ' sphere ( cs ) with a steeper density profile , @xmath26 , and an anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "this density profile ( for @xmath27 , the radius of the sun s orbit ) is commonly associated with the stellar halo ( or ` spheroid ' ) that consists of old , metal - poor stars . while the local density of the luminous halo is observed to be low @xmath28pc@xmath29 @xcite , it is possible that the stellar halo has a signifficantly more massive , dark ( though plausibly baryonic ) counterpart of a similar structure .",
    "[ a massive , dark ` spheroid ' of local density @xmath30pc@xmath29 was proposed in the past as a dynamically relevant component of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "microlensing by ` spheroid ' objects has been discussed by , e.g. , giudice , mollerach & roulet ( 1994 ) and de rjula _",
    "( 1995 ) . ] along with the @xmath31 density profile , the radius - dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy ( see section 2 ) adopted for our cs model describes rather accurately a well known stellar halo population , the blue horizontal branch field stars , bhbfs @xcite .",
    "the cs model reflects the possibility that , just like the spatial distribution of the bhbfs , the massive objects distribution may differ from that of the total ( luminous + baryonic + nonbaryonic dark matter ) halo mass .    as a result of our ` experiment '",
    "we find that , although @xmath22 and @xmath32 are weakly affected by the halo model ambiguity , the inferred @xmath33 is on the average about 60% greater than the real value .",
    "it is important that unless @xmath34 , the statistics based only on event durations does not allow us to distinguish between the two massive objects halo structures ; the differences between them are submerged in the statistical noise .",
    "these results indicate that the uncertainty of the inferred average mass will be difficult to reduce below about the factor of 2 .",
    "a similar conclusion , with similar magnitudes of relative errors , holds for the massive object halo s local density @xmath35 and the total halo mass between the solar orbit and lmc , @xmath36 . the unresolvable ( at @xmath37 )",
    "ambiguity is characteristic of a broad range of halo models that one might choose as the ` real ' ones instead of cs , although the ensuing uncertainty of the inferred average dark objects mass and their total halo mass may be smaller than that obtained in the specific case of the cs / sis ambiguity .",
    "[ since the inferred halo density in the vicinity of the sun for the cs model is about twice the value for the isothermal sphere , it may be possible to rule out the more concentrated ( e.g. @xmath38 at @xmath27 ) halo models on the basis of dynamical arguments even at @xmath39 _ if _ the mho halo indeed turns out to be very massive , i.e. , approaching the total halo mass . for more detail see @xcite . ]",
    "these results are supported by our maximum likelihood simulations presented in section 5 , where the ( appropriately parametrised ) halo model is treated as unknown and its parameters are varied together with the mass function parameters : only at @xmath34 events do the errors in @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 fall below 50% .",
    "given the current detection rate of a few events per year , and even hoping that it could be increased in the future , the very large number of events needed does not support optimism regarding an accurate inference of mhos masses and their halo fraction on the basis of lmc events only .",
    "probing the halo at various angles relative to the center of galaxy , e.g. through the observation of events toward m31 , could help distinguish between different halo models .",
    "a considerable improvement might come from gaining more information from individual events by , e.g. , parallax measurements ( refsdal 1966 ; gould 1992 , 1994 , 1995b ) that could put tight constraints on mhos spatial distribution and/or kinematics .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the halo models that will be used in the subsequent sections .",
    "section 3 outlines the derivation of microlensing rates . in section 4",
    "we discuss the mhos mass function determination errors assuming a _ known _ halo model while in section 5 we study the effects of halo model uncertainties .",
    "finally , the appendix provides some statements and formulae of mathematical statistics ( along with the derivations ) that are extensively used in the main body of the paper .",
    "in this paper we will consider a range of models of the massive halo objects distribution and velocities . for simplicity , we will restrict our discussion to spherically symmetric halos .",
    "one of the most commonly used models is the isothermal sphere with the velocity dispersion constant throughout the halo the density profile which is well approximated by @xmath40 where @xmath41kpc is the ` core ' radius and @xmath42kpc is the distance of the sun from the galactic centre . assuming that the total ( luminous + dark matter ) halo density is distributed according to expression ( [ isoth.core ] ) , one obtains the observed ( approximately ) flat rotation curve for the galaxy .",
    "the hmo mass distribution , however , need not follow that of the total halo mass .",
    "one possibility is that the massive objects may be more concentrated toward the galactic centre .",
    "we may thus follow the clues provided by recent observations @xcite of the blue horizontal branch field stars ( bhbfs ) in the outer halo .",
    "these observations imply that the velocity dispersion changes from @xmath43 at smaller distances from the centre of the galaxy to @xmath44 at larger distances .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is well described by the analytic fit @xmath45,\\ ] ] where the best agreement with the observations is achieved with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48kpc and @xmath49kpc .",

    "although @xmath32 is not large , and accordingly , the ` plateau ' is not very broad , one can clearly recognise the effects of @xmath22 being equal to @xmath185 : it is due to the relatively large spread in @xmath168 ( plateau ) that the curve is so sensitive to small parameter changes .",
    "in addition , the consequences of the shifts in @xmath22 and @xmath32 can be clearly distinguished .",
    "thus for @xmath186 , the mode of the curve shifts towards longer times ; the rough symmetry of @xmath178 at the plateau is broken and now longer events dominate .",
    "by contrast , the change in @xmath32 only supresses ( @xmath187 ) or sharpens ( @xmath188 ) the curve without shifting its mode . on the other hand , for @xmath189",
    "a positive shift in @xmath22 is closer to producing effect similar to that of a negative @xmath190 .",
    "this degeneracy gives rise to a small value of the determinant of the information matrix @xmath191 which enhances the errors in @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "the flatness of @xmath178 in the vicinity of @xmath192 corresponds to roughly equal contribution of the mho s with masses @xmath193 and the ones with @xmath194 [ see also @xcite ] to the total event rate .",
    "as we move toward larger @xmath22 , the rate is dominated by larger masses ( or , if we reduce @xmath22 , by smaller masses ) .",
    "this simple fact helps explain an interesting feature of the bottom panel of fig . 6 : while at @xmath181 the error in @xmath32 is slightly lower for @xmath195 than for @xmath196 ( see argument above : the plateau is broader for @xmath140 ) , this error increases more rapidly for @xmath140 as we shift away from @xmath192 .",
    "this is a consequence of the ` tail ' ( in terms of contribution to the event rate ) of the mass function being less accessible [ i.e. more distant from the ( effective ) concentration of masses at the opposite end ] in the case of the larger @xmath32 .",
    "in this section we will study the extent to which the inference of the mho mass function will be hampered by the unavoidable uncertainty of the massive objects halo structure , i.e. their distribution and kinematics . for simplicity , we will consider only spherically symmetric halos .    at",
    "first , we will estimate how much the inferred parameters of the mass function could be offset _ systematically _ relative to the real values if instead of fitting the event duration distribution function @xmath197 based on the ` true ' halo , we use the distribution function @xmath198 based on a ` false ' halo model . as we explain in the appendix , a reasonable estimate of this shift in the parameters",
    "can be obtained by finding the mass function parameters @xmath151 for which the expression @xmath199 is maximised ( @xmath200 denotes the ` real ' mass function parameters ) .",

    "8 we show distributions @xmath197 based on the ` concentrated sphere ' ( cs ) halo model _ along with _ their best matches from among the distributions @xmath198 based on the sis model for parameters indicated in the figure caption . [ here as throughout this section we use @xmath144 const . ]",
    "while the two curves in the upper panel are close to each other , the ones in the lower panel are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "this is a typical situation for a broad range of the ( ` real ' ) mass function parameters : by shifting the mass function parameters we can mask to a great extent the effects of changes in the halo model .",
    "conversely , as long as we lack _ independent _ information about the mhos distribution and kinematics , there always will be significant errors in the determination of the mass function from event durations only .",
    "the relatively less accurate match of the two curves in the upper panel is characteristic of the values of @xmath22 that allow an accurate inference of the mass function according to the results of the last section",
    ". we will discuss below in this section how we can take advantage of this residual difference to obtain a more accurate measure of the mass function . at present",
    "we will assume that we are indeed in error regarding the mho distribution and kinematics and are thus using a false ( sis ) halo model instead of the right ( cs ) one .",
    "what are the magnitudes of the systematic errors that ensue ?    in fig .",
    "9 we can observe the dependence of the systematic shift , described above , on the value of @xmath201 for @xmath202 ( solid curve ) and @xmath203 ( dotted curve ) .",

    "the inferred mass scales as @xmath205 , where @xmath175 is the typical velocity dispersion in the halo and @xmath206 denotes the average of the quantity over the differential event rate . by using the sis instead of the ` right ' cs halo model",
    ", we gain a factor of @xmath207 due to the increased @xmath175 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , while the mass estimate is reduced due to the larger @xmath206 ( the sis halo is more extended ) . the net result is a shift in @xmath33 that depends only weakly on @xmath201 and @xmath208 .",
    "[ the segments bordered by stars show results of monte - carlo simulations ( 10000 events ) up to their statistical errors obtained from 400 simulations .",
    "the agreement with the results obtained by minimising ( [ psi.bias ] ) is good but not perfect .",
    "see appendix for a brief discussion of the limitations of the method based on equation ( [ psi.bias ] ) . ]",
    "we also notice that for @xmath209 both @xmath22 and @xmath32 are relatively weakly affected by the uncertainties of the halo model .",
    "this may be expected on the basis of our discussion ( see the last section ) of the ` plateau ' in @xmath198 for values of @xmath201 near @xmath210 .",
    "the presence of the ` plateau ' is independent of the halo model ; it is a robust property carried over from @xmath197 to @xmath198 .",
    "( our results for various values of the ` true ' halo parameters , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath128 , indicate that @xmath22 and @xmath32 are generally insensitive to the halo model uncertainties in the above range of @xmath22 . )    by contrast , for @xmath215 the shift is significant . in this range of @xmath201 , @xmath216 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath32 is very flat and insensitive to shifts in the two parameters . due to this circumstance ,",
    "even a slight ` tilt ' to the function @xmath216 due to a switch to another halo model is likely to lead to a large shift in the position of the function s maximum in the @xmath217 plane .",
    "this is closely related to the basic reasons for large statistical errors for @xmath215 that we discussed in the last section . from the point of view of the inference of @xmath22 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the bias due to the uncertainty of the halo model would in this case only compound already very large statistical errors .",
    "the same holds for large negative values of @xmath22 ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "in addition to the effect on the mass function determination , mho distribution and kinematics uncertainties will bear on the determination of the density and total mass in the massive objects halo . if @xmath219 const .",
    "the two integrations in the total rate  ( [ rate.y ] ) can be performed in the reversed order @xmath220 and the total rate takes on the form @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a constant independent of either the halo model or the mho mass function and @xmath223 obviously [ see equation  ( [ pmut ] ) ] , @xmath224 depends only on the halo model but not on the parameters of the mass function .",
    "it also turns out that the equality @xmath225 [ @xmath226 and @xmath227 are again the best fits obtained with the ` false ' halo model ] is satisfied with better than 1% accuracy for the range of @xmath22 and @xmath32 discussed in this paper . since the inferred @xmath33 , shown in fig .",
    "9 , depends only very weakly on @xmath22 and @xmath32 it follows that the ratio @xmath228 is practically independent of @xmath22 and @xmath32 .    in the case discussed in this section so far , where the cs halo is chosen as the ` real ' one and the sis as the halo model used in the inference of the mass function , we obtain @xmath229 .",
    "although the inferred value of the local mho halo density @xmath35 is only half the actual one , the much slower fall - off of the sis density at larger distances leads to the inferred total halo mass , @xmath230 , between the sun and the lmc being about twice the actual amount .",
    "since both the isothermal sphere and the ` concentrated ' sphere can be viewed as plausible models of the massive objects halo , the parameter shifts evaluated so far in this section provide an estimate of the magnitude of error due to halo structure uncertainty . as we have stated above , due to the difficulty of distinguishing among different halo structures on the basis of event duration measurements only , it would appear unlikely that these ( systematic ) errors should be possible to eliminate .",
    "= 8 cm    = 8 cm    on the other hand , we have noticed in the early part of this section that for @xmath22 in the range most conducive to mass function parameter inference ( @xmath231 ) , there is a residual difference between the differential event rate based on one halo model and its best match based on a different halo structure ( upper panel of fig .",
    "can this difference be exploited in a realistic statistical inference in order to reduce the effect of the halo structure uncertainty ? specifically , with how many detected events do we need to sample the differential rate so that the small difference can be recognised ?    in order to answer this question we perform a number ( 400 ) of monte - carlo simulations of the mass function parameters statistical inference . again , we assume that the ` real ' halo is cs , @xmath232 , @xmath152 , and @xmath233 , generate a given number of events ( @xmath163 , @xmath234 or @xmath235 ) and obtain maximum likelihood fits based in turns on the cs and the ( ` false ' ) sis halo . in fig .",
    "10 we show the results of the kolmogorov - smirnov test of acceptability of the maximum likelihood fits ( based on the two different halos ) as models for the observed data .",
    "at @xmath163 it makes virtually no difference which halo model is used as a basis for statistical inference : the small discrepancy between the two event rate curves observed in fig .",
    "8 is completely swamped by the statistical noise . on the other hand , for @xmath236",
    "the difference starts to be significant , although the probability of confusion between the two halos in any single data realisation is still high . at @xmath237",
    "the ambiguity is completely resolved .",
    "obviously , it is at about @xmath236 that we may first start discerning the halo structure effects and thus hope to be able to reduce the ( halo model - induced ) errors in the mass function parameters estimated earlier in this section .",
    "this conclusion is borne out by monte - carlo simulations where all eight parameters ( @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath128 , @xmath33 , @xmath22 and @xmath32 ) are varied with a uniform prior to obtain maximum - likelihood fits to events distributed according to the differential event rate whose parameters are indicated by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "the vertical bars show ` @xmath238 ' intervals for inferred values of the parameters .",
    "[ the inferred @xmath35 and @xmath36 are simply read out from the event rate ( [ rate ] ) given a fixed event number of events and observation time without allowing for the inevitable poisson count noise . ]    as we concluded earlier in this section , for @xmath239 the effects of the halo uncertainty on @xmath22 and @xmath32 are rather weak and these parameters are obtained with a good accuracy from between 100 and 1000 events .",
    "the halo model uncertainty adds little to the errors estimated in the last section . on the other hand ,",
    "the error in @xmath33 falls bellow the level estimated above in this section only at @xmath240 .",
    "notice that at @xmath237 the error is larger by a factor of about 10 than the value obtained with a fixed halo model ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the improvement at @xmath241 is not necessarily reflected in an accurate knowledge of the structure of the halo : for instance , @xmath214 and @xmath128 , and thus the velocity profile , are not accurately determined even for the largest @xmath4 s shown in fig .",
    "it is rather that for @xmath4 near @xmath234 the halo is constrained just enough to allow a more reliable mass function inference ; the small gap between the two curves of the upper panel of fig .",
    "8 can thus be much reduced with a rather broad range of best - fit halo models .",
    "probably the most important quantities characterising the halo , its local density @xmath35 and total mass between the sun and lmc , @xmath36 ( themselves functions of the above eight parameters and the observed event rate ) clearly gain in accuracy with increasing @xmath4 ( see the two top panels of fig . 11 ) .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that only at around @xmath237 is the error due to halo structure uncertainty reduced to roughly the level of the simple poisson count fluctuation @xmath242 associated with the total number of ( reliable ) lmc events detected by the time of this writing .",
