    "the solar magnetic field @xmath7 is the parker spiral with a dominant east - west orientation .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) is expected to have a component in the north - south direction to account for the asymmetries in the heliosphere ( opher et al . 2006 ; 2007 ; 2009 ; izmodenov et al .",
    "2009 ; pogorelov et al .",
    "consequently , there is an expectation that the magnetic field direction will rotate dramatically across the heliopause ( hp ) , which is the boundary that separates the plasma domain of the sun from that of the interstellar medium .",
    "this rotation was used as one of the criteria to determine if v1 has already crossed the hp .",
    "based on this fact , the absence of a significant rotation in the direction of the magnetic field at the times of dropouts of energetic particles produced within the heliosphere were interpreted as indicating that v1 was still in the heliosheath ( burlaga et al .",
    "2013 ; krimigis et al .",
    "2013 ; stone et al .",
    "however , simulations suggested a more complex hp with magnetic islands that would produce dropouts in the intensity of hs particles with essentially no local magnetic field rotation ( swisdak et al .",
    "in such a picture v1 might have already crossed the hp just before the dropouts . recently",
    "the voyager team indeed concluded that v1 was in interstellar space based on the elevated plasma density inferred from plasma wave measurements ( gurnett et al .",
    "the crossing was conjectured to have happened around the time of the dropouts in august of 2012 . on the other hand",
    ", others have suggestioned that v1 remains in the hs ( fisk & gloeckler 2013 ; mccomas & schwadron 2012 ) . in any case , if v1 is in interstellar space the important question is why v1 has not revealed a significant rotation in the direction of the magnetic field outside the hp ( burlaga et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in this letter we present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the global heliosphere that reveal that strong rotations in the direction of the magnetic field at the hp at the location of v1 ( and v2 ) are not expected .",
    "only after some significant distance outside the hp , is the direction of the field distinguishably different from a parker spiral .",
    "this results implies that the magnetic field orientation can not be used as a marker for the crossing of the hp for the voyager spacecrafts .    in the next section",
    "we describe the twist of the interstellar magnetic field as it approaches the hp and then make some concluding remarks .",
    "to study the twist of the interstellar magnetic field we use our 3d mhd model ( opher et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is based on a multi - fluid description that includes adaptive mesh refinement as well as the magnetic field of the sun and the interstellar magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it possesses 5-fluids , 1 ionized and 4 neutral h fluids .",
    "the multi - fluid approach for the neutrals ( alexashov & izmodenov 2005 , zank 1999 ) captures the main features of the kinetic model ( izmodenov 2009 )",

    "population 1 appears in the region behind the bow shock ( or slow shock , depending on the intensity of @xmath0 ( zieger et al .",

    "all four populations are described by separate systems of the euler equations with corresponding source terms describing neutral - ion charge exchange .",
    "the inner boundary of our domain is a sphere at @xmath8u and the outer boundary is at @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "parameters of the solar wind at the inner boundary were chosen to match the values obtained by ( izmodenov 2009 ) at @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the parker spiral magnetic field @xmath16 at the equator . in our simulation , we assume that the magnetic axis is aligned with the solar rotation axis . the solar wind flow at the inner boundary is assumed to be spherically symmetric . for the interstellar plasma we assume : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "as shown by ( zieger et al .",
    "2013 ) a slow bow shock can form ahead of the hp .",
    "as the interstellar magnetic field goes through a slow bow shock , the angle @xmath40 slightly changes .",

    "this angle is very similar to the latitude of v1 ( @xmath50 above the solar equator ) .",
    "the implication is that far from the hp the location where @xmath2 and @xmath40 are zero is nearly along the v1 trajectory .",
    "therefore as v1 adventures farther away from the hp , @xmath40 will increase slightly but remain small .",
    "this increase will be stronger in cases with higher angle @xmath26 ( as in the case where @xmath51 ; figure 2b )",
    ". the magnetic field direction at v2 will be very different .",

    "the implication is that for neither v1 nor v2 can a strong magnetic field rotation out of the plane of the parker spiral be used as a marker for the crossing of the hp . on the other hand",
    ", we do expect some rotation in the field direction ( or a change in the angle @xmath40 ) across the hp .",
    "therefore , the several particle intensity dropouts detected by v1 from days 210 - 270 , 2012 where there was no significant change in the direction of the magnetic field ( burlaga et al .",
    "2013 ) can not correspond to hp crossings .",
    "our interpretation ( swisdak et al . 2013 ) is that the dropouts correspond to the separatrices of large - scale magnetic islands that form on the hp where the flux of heliospheric particles from the hs to the local interstellar medium ( lism ) is suppressed . in this interpretation",
    "v1 crossed the hp on day 209 ( when a current layer was crossed ) and it has been measuring @xmath0 since that time . the angle @xmath40 reported during the subsequent period ( burlaga et al .",
    "2013 ) is steady and around @xmath52 , which is consistent with the results of our simulations in the region outside of the hp . only after some distance from the hp",

    "<S> there was an expectation that the magnetic field direction would rotate dramatically across the heliopause ( hp ) . </S>",
    "<S> this rotation was used as one of the criteria to determine if voyager 1 ( v1 ) had crossed the hp . </S>",
    "<S> recently the voyager team concluded that v1 crossed into interstellar space last year ( gurnett et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2013 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the question is then why there was no significant rotation in the direction of the magnetic field across the hp ( burlaga et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2013 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we present simulations that reveal that strong rotations in the direction of the magnetic field at the hp at the location of v1 ( and voyager 2 ) are not expected . </S>",
    "<S> the solar magnetic field strongly affects the drapping of the interstellar magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) around the hp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 twists as it approaches the hp and acquires a strong t component ( east - west ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strong increase in the t component occurs where the interstellar flow stagnates in front of the hp . at this same location </S>",
    "<S> the n component @xmath1 is significantly reduced . above and below the neighboring interstellar magnetic field lines </S>",
    "<S> also twist into the t direction . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior occurs for a wide range of orientations of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath2 component at the v1 location and the associated angle @xmath3 are small ( around @xmath4 ) , as seen in the observations ( burlaga et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2013 ) . only after some significant distance outside the hp , is the direction of the interstellar field distinguishably different from that of the parker spiral </S>"
