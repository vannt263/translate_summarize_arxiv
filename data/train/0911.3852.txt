    "in the last decade or so remarkable progress has been made in measuring cosmological parameters to unprecedented accuracy .",
    "parameters such as the hubble constant , @xmath1 @xcite , the temperature of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , @xmath2 @xcite , and many other parameters , are now known to impressive precision .",
    "of course , we do nt invest so much time and effort determining cosmological parameters because of an interest in numerology , but rather , because the parameters are necessary inputs for the task of constructing a standard cosmological model .    in turn",
    ", we do not construct cosmological models simply to make predictions to compare with observations , but rather , to guide us to , in the words of einstein @xcite , `` a deeper and more consistent comprehension of the physical and astronomical facts . ''",
    "the precision cosmological measurements have lead to the latest cosmological model , usually called the _ standard cosmological model , _ the _ concordance model _ , or simply @xmath0cdm , where @xmath0 indicates the inclusion of einstein s cosmological constant ( or more generally , dark energy ) , and cdm stands for cold dark matter .",
    "the model is but one possible realization of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "( we will refer to homogeneous / isotropic models as friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) models . )",
    "the question yet to be answered is whether today s standard model will lead us to a deeper and more consistent comprehension of the physical and astronomical facts .",
    "a troubling feature of the @xmath0cdm model is the present composition of the universe : @xmath3 is dark ! of the dark components ,",
    "roughly @xmath4 of the total mass - energy density is dark matter , associated with galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and other bound structures .",
    "the bulk of the mass - energy of the universe , about @xmath5 in the standard @xmath0cdm model , is attributed to dark energy , which is usually said to drive an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the observations and phenomena that lead to the assumptions of dark matter and dark energy are real , but that does not necessarily imply that dark matter and dark energy as usually envisioned are real .",
    "dark matter and dark energy are good names for the phenomena . but naming is not explaining !    in some sense , an even more remarkable feature of the standard cosmological model is that it seems capable of accounting for all cosmological observations ; _ i.e. , _ it seems to work ! here",
    ", we address the issue of whether the agreement with observations prejudices our judgment regarding the likelihood that the @xmath0cdm model is the final answer .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the possibility that dark energy , _ per se _ , does not exist .",
    "the most important point regarding dark energy ( and also , for that matter , the acceleration of the expansion of the universe ) , which is central to the motivation for this paper , is that all evidence for dark energy is _ indirect . _",
    "the only effect of dark energy is on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe is perhaps the most fundamental quantity in cosmology . in the standard cosmological model the expansion rate",
    "is determined from the @xmath6-component of the einstein equations , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . in flrw models , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the expansion rate ( here",
    ", @xmath11 is the robertson - walker scale factor and @xmath12 or @xmath13 , depending on the geometry ) . with the assumption of a perfect - fluid stress tensor , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass density .",
    "the stress tensor is assumed to consist of several components with different equations of state . for any component @xmath16 , the equation of state for that component",

    "if @xmath18 is constant , the energy density in component @xmath16 evolves with redshift @xmath19 as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the present value of the scale factor .",
    "then the expansion rate as a function of redshift can be expressed as @xmath22 \\right ] + \\omega_k(1+z)^2 + \\omega_m(1+z)^3 + \\omega_r(1+z)^4   \\right\\ } .",

    "the subscript `` @xmath25 '' indicates a spatial - curvature contribution ( @xmath26 , `` @xmath27 '' indicates a matter component ( @xmath28 ) , `` @xmath29 '' indicates a radiation component ( @xmath30 ) , and `` @xmath0 '' represents dark energy . in the event",
    "that the function @xmath31 in the last term is independent of @xmath32 , the last term in @xmath33 becomes @xmath34 .",
    "the equation of state for a cosmological constant is @xmath35 .",
    "it appears that the expansion rate as a function of @xmath32 depends on four constants @xmath36 and one function @xmath31 . in reality",
    ", the situation is much more predictive .",
    "first , since @xmath37 , it follows that @xmath38 , removing one constant .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is well determined by wmap to be small , @xmath40 at the @xmath41 confidence level @xcite , effectively removing yet another constant .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is also well determined by cbr measurements ( @xmath43 ) removing a further constant .",
    "one may then make the less secure assumption that @xmath44 is `` known , '' or more profitably , use observational constraints to marginalize over the @xmath23 s , leaving only the function @xmath31 undetermined . the function must be determined through its effect on the expansion history of the universe , which is manifest through various cosmological observables .",
    "many cosmological observables depend on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "they often depend on the expansion history through the coordinate distance @xmath45 of a source of redshift @xmath32 . recall that the robertson - walker metric can be written in the form @xmath46 , \\label{rw}\\ ] ] where here @xmath47 is the angular differential and @xmath45 is the comoving `` radial '' coordinate .",
    "the radial coordinate of a source at redshift @xmath32 is determined by integrating the null geodesic equation ( @xmath48 ) to obtain @xmath49 , \\label{rofz}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 obtains for @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "observables such as the luminosity distance , the angular - diameter distance , the volume element , and the age of the universe , all depend on the time evolution of the expansion rate , hence on the properties of the stress tensor , hence on the dark energy fluid characterized by @xmath54 .    at present , a constant @xmath31 seems to fit the data , and furthermore @xmath35 , the value of @xmath54 for a cosmological constant , is not disallowed .",
    "it is also true that since there is no apparent reason to exclude vacuum energy from the stress tensor , there is no reason _ not _ to imagine it enters the determination of the expansion rate .",
    "the problem is that the magnitude of the expected vacuum energy is very many orders of magnitude larger than expected .",
    "if the cosmological constant is part of nature , then either some principle must be found to explain the much smaller - than - expected magnitude of @xmath55 , or one must resort to anthropic arguments .",
    "this situation has led many to consider alternate explanations of the observations : modified gravity , new long - range forces , new ultra - light scalar fields , extra dimensions , branes , bulk , lorentz - invariance violation , _ etc . _",
    "some of these approaches are , in many respects , more drastic than a small cosmological constant .",
    "for instance , theories of modified gravity typically do not respect the principle of general covariance . since we should not abandon our principles without good cause , it is tempting to retreat to the position that since a cosmological constant is adequate to account for the data , just assume that it exists and call it a day ?    we resist the retreat because our goal in cosmology is more than just explaining the observations .",
    "the ingredients of a cosmological model must be deeply grounded in fundamental physics .",
    "dark matter , dark energy , modified gravity , mysterious new forces and particles , _ etc . , _ unless part of an overarching model of nature , should not be part of a cosmological model .",
    "we may plant new ideas and features into cosmological models , but they will ultimately prove barren unless grounded in fundamental physics .",
    "no matter how well a concordance model fits the data , its ingredients must not be discordant with fundamental physics .",
    "in this paper we explore a less traveled path , and consider the possibility that the friedmann equation is not an adequate description of our inhomogeneous universe @xcite . in this approach",
    "there is no need for dark energy , so no need for new long - range forces , modifications of general relativity , new ultralight particles , or anthropic reasoning .",
    "the phenomenon of inhomogeneities mimicking dark energy is sometimes referred to as `` backreaction . ''    in this paper we follow the prescription of mustapha , hellaby , and ellis @xcite [ mhe ] , recently applied to @xmath0cdm models by clrier , bolejko , krasinski , and hellaby @xcite , and explore the implications of the fact that one can construct a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous model that _ exactly _ reproduces the redshift dependence of the luminosity distance and mass density of any given @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we show that in general one expects the cosmological solution thus obtained to have a `` mixmaster '' approach to the initial singularity , with the radial scale factor diverging and the angular scale factor vanishing .",
    "we then show that there is another cosmological solution with the same density and curvature functions as the singular model but with regular initial conditions where both scale factors vanish at the singularity , and that this regular solution well _ approximates _ another @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we then discuss the utility of different averaging prescriptions for understanding the results .    in the next section",

    "bondi @xcite ( ltb ) models in general , and in the next section we discuss a particular ltb model that _ exactly _ reproduces select observational features of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "ltb models are spherically symmetric cosmological solutions to the einstein equations with a dust stress - energy tensor .",
    "the ltb model is based on the assumptions that the system has purely radial motion and the motion is geodesic without shell crossing ( otherwise the pressure could not be neglected ) .",
    "the line element in the synchronous gauge can be written in the form @xmath56 here , the prime superscript denotes @xmath57 .",
    "we will denote @xmath58 by an overdot .",
    "the function @xmath59 is an arbitrary function of @xmath45 .",
    "the robertson ",
    "walker metric can be recovered if @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    in spherically symmetric models , in general there are two expansion rates : an angular expansion rate , @xmath62 , and a radial expansion rate , @xmath63 .",
    "with the dust equation of state , the einstein equations may be expressed as @xmath64 these represent the generalization of the friedmann equation for a homogeneous / isotropic universe to a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous universe .",
    "the equations may be manipulated to result in an easily integrable dynamical equation for @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a function of @xmath45 related to the density @xmath68 by @xmath69 equation ( [ rdot ] ) can be differentiated to yield the dynamical equation for @xmath70 : @xmath71    the two functions @xmath67 and @xmath59 define the ltb model , playing roles analogous to the total energy density parameter @xmath72 and the spatial curvature parameter @xmath39 of flrw models . to see this ,",
    "recall that the evolution of the scale factor and time for a hyperbolic dust friedmann model evolves as ( @xmath73 is conformal time ) @xmath74 , \\qquad        t - t_{bb } = h_0^{-1}\\frac { \\omega_0}{2\\omega_k^{3/2 } }      \\left[\\sinh\\eta - \\eta \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the present value of the scale factor and @xmath75 is the time of the big bang ( usually set to zero ) .    since friedmann models are homogeneous and isotropic , they are zero - dimensional models",
    ". the ltb models are spherically symmetric , so they are one - dimensional problems .",
    "so for ltb models the density parameter @xmath72 is replaced by a density function @xmath67 and the curvature parameter @xmath39 is replaced by a curvature function @xmath59 . if @xmath76 , which is the analog of hyperbolic friedmann models , the evolution of the metric function @xmath65 can be described by @xmath77 ; \\qquad t - t_{bb}(r ) = \\frac{\\alpha(r)}{2\\beta^{3/2}(r ) }      \\left[\\sinh\\eta(r ) - \\eta(r)\\right],\\ ] ] where now , in general , the bang time , @xmath78 is a function of @xmath45 , as is the effective conformal time @xmath79 .",
    "the photon geodesic equation for the position of the photon as a function of time , @xmath80 , is found from the ltb metric : @xmath81 the redshift of the photon , @xmath82 , is @xmath83 equations ( [ tofr ] ) and ( [ zofr ] ) are solved with initial conditions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the luminosity distance is then simply @xmath86 ( we denote the luminosity distance by @xmath87 to emphasize that it is a light - cone observable . )",
    "in this section we will review the procedure and results that allow one to construct an ltb model that reproduces    1 .   the luminosity - distance  redshift relationship , @xmath88 , of a fiducial @xmath0cdm model , and 2 .   the light - cone matter density as a function of redshift , @xmath89 , of the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the `` fiducial '' @xmath0cdm model may in principle be any flrw model with a cosmological constant . in this paper",

    "the assumption of spatial flatness will simplify our calculations . neither that assumption , nor the exact value of @xmath55 , is important in our considerations .",

    "we often speak of cosmology within our causal volume , or perhaps the density field at some fixed time like the present ( which includes an acausal region of the universe ) .",
    "we do this even though we have no direct observational evidence for it .",
    "to speak of the universe in this way we must employ a cosmological model that allows us to depart from the light cone ( in theory , not literally ) .",
    "what we say about the universe off the light cone is only as trustworthy as the cosmological model used to generate the information .",
    "but as emphasized by mhe , light - cone observations ( or at least the two light - cone observations we use ) do not uniquely determine the cosmological model on the light - cone ( _ i.e. _ , both the @xmath0cdm and ltb models give the same results ) , so of course they do not uniquely determine the cosmological model off of the light cone .",
    "as in mhe , we take advantage of a coordinate freedom to simplify the calculation .",

    "hatted quantities are often written as functions of @xmath32 , since that is the light - cone coordinate accessible to observations .",
    "the @xmath45 coordinate is scaled such that @xmath80 is given by @xmath100 .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rhonbbbb ] .",
    "note that the reference @xmath0cdm model for this figure is the model with @xmath167 , which well fits the @xmath88 for the regular ltb model .",
    "this figure well illustrates that the density along the light cone compared to a fiducial model can decrease as a function of @xmath32 , while at the present time , it can increase as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "it is beyond the purpose of this paper to see whether one can fiddle with @xmath67 and @xmath59 to find a regular solution that is a better fit to the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the conclusion of this section is that if one attempts to construct an ltb model that agrees exactly with @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the fiducial @xmath0cdm model , the resulting model will have singular initial conditions for @xmath101 .",
    "we have argued that this is to be expected .",
    "we surmise that this will be true in general , and is not specific to our choice of the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we also demonstrated that one can find a regular solution with the same values of @xmath67 and @xmath59 that results in a @xmath88 and @xmath89 that approximates a @xmath0cdm model close to the fiducial model at late time .    in the next section we return to the singular models and examine whether they can be described in terms of averaged quantities .",
    "one proposed route to understanding the role of inhomogeneities in mimicking dark energy is by employing an averaging procedure .",
    "our calculations allow us to study this proposal .",
    "first , let us review the averaging procedure .",
    "a fundamental quantity in the analysis is the velocity gradient tensor , which is defined as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the spatial metric and @xmath170 is the fluid four velocity .",
    "the tensor @xmath171 represents the extrinsic curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces orthogonal to the fluid flow .",
    "it may be decomposed in terms of a trace term and a traceless tensor as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the volume - expansion scalar .",
    "the traceless tensor @xmath174 is the shear .",
    "the evolution equations for the expansion and the shear come from the space - space components of einstein s equations ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "ref.@xcite ) . combining the expansion evolution equation with the energy constraint",
    "gives the _ raychaudhuri equation _",
    ", @xmath175    from the raychaudhuri equation it is straightforward to verify that local fluid elements can not undergo accelerated expansion .",
    "( this point was emphasized by hirata and seljak @xcite . ) but , of course , as now appreciated , that point is irrelevant .",
    "locally the expansion does not accelerate , but it is incorrect to assume that acceleration does not occur when the fluid is coarse - grained over a finite domain .",
    "the reason is trivial : the time derivative of the average of @xmath173 and the average of the time derivative of @xmath173 are not the same because of the time dependence of the coarse - graining volume .",
    "there has been a lot of work recently regarding the averaging procedure .",
    "first , we take the original proposal and average at a fixed time",
    ". we will then average over the light cone .",
    "let us denote the coarse - grained value of a quantity @xmath176 by its average over a spatial domain @xmath177 : @xmath178    following the work of buchert @xcite , we define a dimensionless scale factor @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the volume of our coarse - graining domain ( the subscript `` @xmath13 '' denotes the present time ) .",
    "in the ltb model @xmath181 .    the coarse - grained hubble rate @xmath182 will be @xmath183 the smoothing procedure leads to the evolution equations for the coarse - grained scale factor @xcite : @xmath184 where the effective energy density and pressure terms are ( @xmath185 is the spatial curvature ) @xmath186 and we have introduced the _ kinematical backreaction _",
    "@xmath187 finally , we can define an effective equation of state , @xmath188 , to be @xmath189 .",
    "now for ltb models , @xmath190     as a function of proper distance that sets the scale of the averaging volume for the averaging at the present time .",
    "[ w0],width=453 ]     as a function of proper distance that sets the scale of the averaging volume for the averaging at the present time .",
    "[ w0],width=453 ]     as a function of @xmath32 for light - cone averaging .",
    "[ what],width=453 ]     as a function of @xmath32 for light - cone averaging .",
    "[ what],width=453 ]    the various terms that enter the calculation of @xmath191 and @xmath192 are shown in fig .",
    "[ avg0 ] as a function of the proper distance that sets the scale of the averaging volume .",
    "note that the shear is small , as is the kinematical back reaction since @xmath193 .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ w0 ] is the effective value of @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "note that if one models the fiducial @xmath0cdm model as a single fluid and calculates @xmath194 , the value today is @xmath196 .",
    "another approach is light - cone averaging . here",
    ", what is of interest is nt the average on a ( acausal ) constant - time hypersurface , but rather the average on a hypersurface coinciding with the light cone .",
    "one way to approach this is just to substitute the `` hatted '' quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ dsf]-[ltbm ] ) .",
    "the resulting terms that enter the calculation of the averaged quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ avghat ] , and the effective value of the equation of state parameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ what ] . also shown in fig .",
    "[ what ] is the equation of state parameter for the fiducial @xmath0cdm model if one would model the total energy ( including matter and @xmath0 ) as a single fluid .",
    "there are two things we learn from the exercise of this section .",
    "first , neither averaging on a constant - time hypersurface nor light - cone averaging is easy to connect with the observations corresponding to parameters of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however , for both averaging prescriptions the effective equation - of - state parameter is negative , indicating acceleration of some averaged scale factor .",
    "this may be a valuable check in more complicated models .",
    "it is interesting to note that the shear contribution to the evolution of the averaged quantities is insignificant in both averaging prescriptions .",
    "this seems to be a counterexample to nave claims that if one constructs an inhomogeneous universe to mimic the observations in @xmath0cdm one would generate unacceptably large shear terms .",
    "in the discussion of what we have learned in this investigation , it is useful again to refer the reader to fig .  [ rhat ] and to reiterate that all direct cosmological information we have is limited to the light cone , illustrated by the solid line in the figure .",
    "any statement about the universe off of the light cone is unsupported by direct observations , and hence requires a cosmological model for the evolution of the universe .",
    "an interesting lesson from the consideration of this paper is that if one is just restricted to the two cosmological observables employed in this paper , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , it is impossible to determine _ uniquely _ a cosmological model @xcite . in our case , the fiducial @xmath0cdm model and the singular ltb model result in identical observations for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "that result is valid even if one imagines perfect astronomical observations , since by construction the two cosmological observables are degenerate in the two models .",
    "there are two ways to break the degeneracy , one observational and the other theoretical .",
    "one promising avenue to break the degeneracy with observational data might be to take advantage of the fact that in ltb models there are two different expansion rates , a radial expansion rate @xmath197 , and an angular expansion rate @xmath198 ( they were defined in sect .  [ ltb ] ) .",
    "figure [ h ] shows the differences between the expansion rates in the singular model .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath199 is guaranteed by the input requirements used to construct the model .",
    "quartin and amendola @xcite have recently discussed using cosmic parallax and redshift drift to distinguish between void models and dark energy .",
    "it is possible to pile on additional observational constraints to break the degeneracy .",
    "while this can be done , it misses the important point that if one is restricted to light - cone observations , it is unclear whether any number of observations alone , even of arbitrary precision and with no systematic uncertainties , can uniquely determine a cosmological model , even if it is possible to rule out any ltb model .",
    "an flrw model is a zero - dimensional ( dimensions of space ) model , and the ltb solution is a one - dimensional model . intuition from other fields lead us to believe that the range of solutions in two - dimensional , or fully inhomogeneous three - dimensional models , will be richer .",
    "so it is unclear whether any number of cosmological observations , even to arbitrary accuracy , can uniquely specify a cosmological model .",
    "this point was discussed by kolb , marra , and matarrese ( kmm ) @xcite . in that work",
    "they introduce the concept of cosmological background solutions .",
    "this concept will be useful in elucidating several points , so we briefly review some concepts from kmm .",
    "a cosmological background solution is defined as a mean - field geometry of suitably averaged einstein equations , in which the average expansion is described by a single scale factor .",
    "a cosmological background solution depends upon the spatial curvature and the mass - energy content .",
    "associated with the mass - energy content is a stress - energy tensor that describes a fluid ( or fluids ) with equation(s ) of state that satisfy local energy conditions .",
    "kmm then define several types of background solutions ; of relevance here is the _ phenomenological background solution ( pbs ) _ : a background solution that effectively describes the observations , that is , the data on the past light cone of an observer .",
    "the energy content and curvature of the pbs are not necessarily related to the spatial averages of the energy content and curvature of the observable universe .",
    "the equation of state of the stress - energy tensor of the pbs need not satisfy any of the local energy conditions of the mass - energy content of the universe .    in this nomenclature",
    ", one might imagine that the true background solution is the ltb solution , or more generally some inhomogeneous model , and the fiducial @xmath0cdm solution is merely a phenomenological background solution .",
    "it is unclear whether it is possible , in principle , to exclude this possibility just on the basis of light - cone observations .",
    "observations alone may not be able to determine the true cosmological model , but as remarked in the introduction , we expect the cosmological model to be part of our deeper comprehension of the physical and astronomical facts ; it must fit into the larger framework of particle physics , general relativity , astrophysics , and cosmology .    as an example of larger considerations ,",
    "consider the theory of structure formation . in the fiducial @xmath0cdm model",
    ", structure grows in a background that is close to homogeneous and isotropic , but with small seed perturbations initially generated by inflation .",
    "even in this zero - dimensional model , structure formation is a complicated affair ( at least in the nonlinear regime ) .",
    "structure formation in ltb models is an even more complicated affair @xcite : each spherical shell evolves as an independent flrw model .",
    "one would expect the evolution of structure formation in ltb models to differ from the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however , since structure formation in a three - dimensional model is more complicated still , it is difficult to see how structure formation might be conclusive .",
    "the same argument might apply to other cosmological tests like the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect .",
    "now , we return to the argument that purports to prove that inhomogeneous models can not mimic the effects of dark energy ( see , _ e.g. , _",
    "refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the argument might be paraphrased as follows : perform an expansion of the flrw metric to newtonian order in potential and velocity but take into account the fully nonlinear density inhomogeneities . in the conformal newtonian gauge , the metric will be of the form @xmath200 , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 is conformal time and @xmath201 .",
    "the volume average of the equation then yields @xcite @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the newtonian potential and kinetic energy ( per unit mass ) , @xmath205 here , @xmath206 is the density perturbation in the matter rest frame and @xmath207 is the peculiar velocity .",
    "the argument is that observationally both @xmath203 and @xmath204 are small , hence , inhomogeneities can not mimic dark energy .",
    "however the model constructed in sec .",
    "[ recon ] seems to belie this simple and compelling argument .",
    "if one interprets the observations of @xmath89 of the ltb model in terms of the fiducial @xmath0cdm phenomenological background solution , one would conclude that the perturbations are very small ( _ viz .",
    "_  zero ) , hence @xmath203 and @xmath204 zero , and inhomogeneities could not mimic dark energy .",
    "but , at least for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , inhomogeneities do exactly that !",
    "we point out that the very notion of peculiar velocities requires a background solution ( a norm ) about which to define `` peculiarity '' @xcite .",
    "also , enqvist , mattsson , and rigopoulos @xcite explicitly demonstrate how spherically symmetric perturbations of a dust universe can lead to acceleration while the perturbations of the gravitational potential remain small on all scales .",
    "perhaps the general lesson is that there are highly non - gaussian inhomogeneities in the late universe , and the coherence of structures causes small deviations in observables to sum to a large deviation .",
    "we can venture a different way to frame the argument : if the observed density fluctuations , @xmath208 , originated from the growth of perturbations in an flrw cosmology , and the nonlinear perturbations on one scale did not affect the growth of structure or the evolution of the background solution on any other scale , and inhomogeneities do not show coherence or non - gaussianity , and @xmath209 , then one can say that the interpretation of observations would yield a value of @xmath203 and @xmath204 that are too small to mimic dark energy .",
    "this way of framing the argument makes manifest the fact that there are dynamical assumptions that enter , and it can not simply be a matter that small peculiar velocities rule out the backreaction proposal . if any of the dynamical assumptions fail , the argument fails .",
    "another lesson that can be extracted from the exercise of this paper concerns using averaging procedures to quantify the effect of inhomogeneities on observables .",
    "this was the subject of the previous section .",
    "the conclusion was that while the two averaging prescriptions discussed give an indication that the ltb model would have observables that might be interpreted as arising from dark energy , the effective equation of state parameters do not resemble that of the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this might be because the averaging approach is not very useful , or it might imply something quite troubling .",
    "perhaps the equation of state parameter @xmath194 , which has received so much attention , has a physical interpretation only in flrw models , and in an inhomogeneous universe , where there is no natural time slicing , it is an unphysical construct .",
    "this paper has developed and discussed issues related to the interpretation of cosmological observables in constructing cosmological models and theories . observations of @xmath88 and @xmath89 do not , by and of themselves , prove that there is dark energy or that the universe is accelerating in the usual sense ; they do so only if one assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic and the dynamics of the universe are governed by general relativity .",
    "this paper discussed aspects of the program to develop understanding of how an inhomogeneous universe might mimic dark energy . while consideration of the results of this investigation might lead one to conclude that there are no arguments that conclusively exclude the backreaction proposal , we are no closer to developing an inhomogeneous cosmology alternative to dark energy .    one attempt to construct inhomogeneous cosmological models involves studying `` swiss - cheese '' models comprised of low density voids embedded in an einstein  de sitter background @xcite .",
    "if the void regions are packed together the regions between them form a network of high - density filamentary , or spaghetti - like , structures .",
    "further refinements of this approach have included spherical mass concentrations referred to as `` meatballs '' @xcite .",
    "a swiss - cheese , meatball , and spaghetti cosmological model may include ingredients that are desirable on their own , or work well in combination with one other ingredient , but combining them all may lead to a model that is not easily digestible .",
