    "the past 18 months have seen extraordinary developments in the field of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "several experiments have reported strong experimental evidence of narrow exotic baryon resonances with quantum numbers indicative of the existence of bound states beyond the canonical constituent - quark model view with two or three ( anti-)quark bound states . permitted within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ,",
    "these states have been previously unobserved .",
    "numerous experimental excesses have been reported in pk@xmath0 and nk@xmath1 invariant mass spectra  @xcite consistent with a resonance of mass near 1535mev/@xmath2 and width less than 10mev/@xmath2 carrying strangeness @xmath3 . furthermore , evidence of a narrow resonance in @xmath4 invariant mass spectra has also been observed  @xcite consistent with a resonance of mass near 1860mev/@xmath2 and width less than 18mev/@xmath2 . finally , the heavy flavor sector is not immune from the appearance of these new states :",
    "an excess is observed in pd@xmath5 invariant mass spectra  @xcite consistent with a resonance of mass near 3100mev/@xmath2 and width less than 15mev/@xmath2 .",
    "these experimental results have generated at least an order - of - magnitude more papers concerning the interpretation and phenomenology of these states  @xcite .",
    "a favored interpretation for these new resonances is that of a _ pentaquark _ bound state consisting of four quarks and an anti - quark ( _ e.g. _ , udud@xmath6 , dsds@xmath7 , udud@xmath8 ) ; these states are also described within and may enhance the validity of chiral soliton models  @xcite .",
    "searches for pentaquark states in e@xmath1e@xmath9 annihilations and @xmath10 collisions have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "results from these searches may be compared directly to the observation of known non - exotic states which decay into relevant and similar final states ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , d@xmath13(2010)@xmath14d@xmath15 ) .",
    "negative results may help illuminate the as yet poorly understood pentaquark production process .",
    "from 1989 to 1995 , lep accelerated and collided counter - rotating beams of electrons and positrons to energies of roughly 45gev , allowing collisions with center - of - mass energies at or near the z peak .",
    "this first phase of lep ( lep1 ) delivered a total of 200pb@xmath16 to each of four large general - purpose detector experiments ( aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal ) . in these data , each experiment recorded more than 3 million hadronic z decays yielding in excess of 5@xmath17 reconstructed k@xmath0 mesons and 10@xmath18 @xmath19 baryons .    the second phase of lep ( lep2 ) involved increasing the center - of - mass energies to nearly 210gev in consecutive annual upgrades between 1995 and 2000 . starting in november 1995 , lep attained center - of - mass energies between 130 and 136gev .",
    "subsequent years yielded energies of 161 and 172gev  ( 1996 ) , 183gev  ( 1997 ) , 189gev  ( 1998 ) , between 192 and 196gev  ( 1999 ) , and between 200 and 209gev  ( 2000 ) .",
    "an integrated luminosity of about 500pb@xmath16 was delivered during lep2 to each experiment .",
    "thus far , aleph , delphi , and l3 have analyzed various data samples searching for evidence of pentaquark production .",
    "these detectors are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the event selection strategies across the three lep experiments which have conducted pentaquark searches are similar .",
    "aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite searched for evidence of pentaquark production from the fragmentation of quarks from roughly four million hadronic z decays ( e@xmath1e@xmath20 ) within data taken at or near center - of - mass energies of 91.2gev .",
    "l3  @xcite searched for evidence of pentaquark production from two - photon interactions ( e@xmath1e@xmath21 ) in data taken between center - of - mass energies of 189 and 209gev , with a luminosity - weighted average value of 198gev ; the data sample corresponds to 610pb@xmath16 .",
    "all of the experiments make quality cuts to select good events as well as exploiting the relevant particle identification capabilities of sub - detectors .",
    "all of the experiments rely upon specific energy loss by ionization ( d@xmath22/d@xmath23 ) of charged particles traversing the fiducial volume of various tracking chambers to discriminate between charged particle species ( @xmath24 , k@xmath25 , p/@xmath26 , or e@xmath25 ) .",
    "delphi complements such information with data from a barrel ring imaging cherenkov counter ( brich ) .",
    "selection of k@xmath27 candidates makes use of decay length criteria relative to the primary vertex of oppositely - charged pairs of identified pions as well as cuts on the quality of reconstructed secondary vertices .",
    "similarly , aleph selects @xmath28p@xmath29 candidates by associating oppositely - charged identified pion and proton tracks .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 candidates are paired with pion tracks which yield a displaced secondary vertex to yield a sample of @xmath30 candidates .",
    "finally , samples of d@xmath31 , d@xmath1 , and d@xmath13 mesons were obtained using techniques described in detail in ref .",

    "a smooth deviation of the data from monte carlo expectation is observed in both neutral and doubly - charged combinations due to imperfect simulation of the detector response . the observed data - to - simulation ratio from doubly - charged combinations is used to correct the simulation of neutral pk combinations , shown in figure  [ fig : alephpk](b ) .",
    "the neutral pk combinations show clear resonant activity in the mass range from 1460 to 1800mev/@xmath2 ; this is due to the production of known @xmath19 and @xmath37 resonances .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : alephpk](c ) , non - resonant simulation is subtracted from the data , and the resulting invariant mass distribution is fit to the amplitude of eight nk resonances , most prominently the @xmath35 followed by broader contributions from @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
