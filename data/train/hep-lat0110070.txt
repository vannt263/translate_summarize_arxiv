    "let us start with the explicit form of the massive overlap dirac operator with mass @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes some hermitian dirac operator with mass @xmath3 of the order of the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "one method to compute the action of the sign - function on a vector is by approximating the function by a rational polynomial @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are irreducible polynomials of degree @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the reason for using rational approximations is that for a given approximation error in the infinity - norm the required degree for rational approximations is usually much smaller than the one for polynomial ones , although both converge exponentially in their degree .",
    "there are various methods to perform such an approximation .",
    "the methods differ in how they interpret the notion of the goodness of the approximation .",
    "one can use any definition of a norm characterising the deviation of two functions from each other .    the infinity - norm , for example ,",
    "is defined as the maximal error over a given interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "there exists an algorithm ( remez algorithm @xcite ) to find the best ( rational ) approximation @xmath10 to a function @xmath11 with respect to the infinity - norm ( see also the work of zolotarjov @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the approximation @xmath10 to a given function @xmath11 is the rational function of a given degree that minimises the maximum value of the quantity @xmath12 over the interval @xmath9 $ ] .    in order to approximate the sign - function by a rational polynomial we choose to find an approximation for a constant odd function over the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "to do so we approximate @xmath14 on the interval @xmath15 $ ] to obtain the rational approximation @xmath10 and consider the function @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting approximation can then be written as @xmath17 with real and positive @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this factorised form is most stable for numerical evaluation .",
    "one advantage of using rational polynomials is that one can use the partial fraction decomposition , e.g.  for @xmath20 , @xmath21 which allows us to compute the action of the sign - function at roughly the cost of a single conjugate gradient ( cg ) inversion of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that rational functions are closely related to finite ( truncated ) continued fractions which in turn play an important role in the analytic theory of rational functions @xcite .",
    "indeed , we can write any rational approximation to the sign - function as a continued fraction @xcite @xmath23 then we observe that the inverse of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont_fraction_expansion ] ) is just the @xmath24-component of the schur complement of a larger system @xmath25 instead of inverting ( [ eq : frac_decomposition ] ) using a two - level nested cg(-like ) procedure we can now find the inverse of ( [ eq : cont_fraction_matrix ] ) , i.e.  its ( 1,1)-component , in one go , using just one cg(-like ) search in a single higher dimensional krylov space @xcite .",
    "the operation naturally associated with rational functions is the multiplication and inversion which , of course , is most trivial . for the overlap operator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap_operator ] ) , matters are not so simple since the additional term proportional to @xmath26 does not commute with @xmath27 and its approximations .",
    "we can , however , still make use of some properties of ( finite ) continued fractions . the most important one is contained in the following theorem on equivalence transformations : two continued fractions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are equivalent if and only if there exists a sequence of non - zero constants @xmath30 with @xmath31 such that @xmath32 this can most easily be seen by writing down the continued fraction after a transformation , @xmath33 in fact the coefficients @xmath34 parametrise the equivalence class of a continued fraction corresponding to a given rational polynomial .",
    "it is important to note that although the equivalence transformation leaves the value of the continued fraction invariant it affects the spectrum and correspondingly the condition number of the larger system ( [ eq : cont_fraction_matrix ] ) . one might therefore hope to find within an equivalence class of continued fractions the one with the smallest condition number",
    "it is easy to apply the equivalence transformation to an overlap operator in which the sign - function is approximated by a rational function and expanded as a continued fraction . in complete analogy to the previous section we express the linear system of the hermitian overlap dirac operator @xmath35 as a simple five dimensional system where , are five dimensional fermion fields and @xmath36 is a block tridiagonal matrix similar to ( [ eq : cont_fraction_matrix ] ) with on the diagonal , with trivial dirac and colour structure on the off diagonals and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 s are uniquely determined by the rational approximation of the sign - function while the @xmath34 s are free parameters describing the equivalence class of continued fractions associated with the given rational approximation .",
    "we observe that an equivalence transformation on the continued fraction acts in a similar way to block jacobi preconditioning .",
    "indeed we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a block diagonal matrix having the four dimensional unit matrix @xmath41 in the first block and @xmath42 in the remaining ones .",
    "for the linear system under consideration this preconditioning comes for free since the first component of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not affected at all .",
    "it turns out that within an equivalence class the condition number of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , can vary by orders of magnitude .",
    "an obvious choice for the equivalence transformation parameters is @xmath47 , and indeed , with this choice the matrix is already well - conditioned .",
    "in order to find the optimal values for the @xmath34 in the sense of giving the lowest @xmath46 one can study the matrix in the free case where the spectrum can be calculated analytically .",
    "a non - linear minimisation of @xmath46 then yields a set of optimal values for the coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "how much is the effective gain in a practical application ? in order to address this question we generated an ensemble of pure gauge field configurations with the wilson gauge action at @xmath48 on @xmath49 lattices .",
    "we used the standard wilson dirac operator @xmath50 with @xmath51 as the input operator for the overlap and a @xmath52 rational approximation for the inverse square root on the interval @xmath15=[0.00724,1]$ ] .",
    "this generates a five dimensional operator with an extent of 18 in the fifth dimension .",
    "then we calculated the inverse of the hermitian overlap operator @xmath53 using the five and four dimensional formulation with different quark masses @xmath0 on a random vector .",
    "figure [ fig : hw_vs_mu ] shows the average number of @xmath54-matrix multiplications for the inversion in three cases : the pole approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : frac_decomposition ] ) , ( @xmath55 overlap ) , the five dimensional operators @xmath45 with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 matrix ) and @xmath45 with the optimal @xmath34 s as obtained from the free field approximation ( @xmath57 matrix optimised ) .",
    "the results indicate that it is indeed possible to generate five dimensional systems which are well conditioned and that the obstacle of having large condition numbers for the five dimensional system can be avoided . for small quark masses the inversion seems to behave better than the one of the corresponding four dimensional system .",
    "this is of particular importance in the context of dynamical overlap fermion simulations where the inversion of the fermion matrix plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the five dimensional formulation using continued fractions is its obvious suitability for parallel computations ."
