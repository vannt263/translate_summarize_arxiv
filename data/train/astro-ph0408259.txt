    "the magellanic bridge ( mb ) is an elongated , predominantly neutral hydrogen ( hi ) structure , located between and joining the large and small magellanic clouds ( kerr , hindman , & robinson , 1954 ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( ruika , 2003 ; gardiner , sawa , & fujimoto , 1994 ; gardiner & noguchi , 1996 ) and the relative geometrical arrangement of the components of the magellanic system ( e.g. mathewson , schwarz & murray , 1977 ) indicate that the mb was formed directly from the magellanic clouds , following a particularly close mutual pass @xmath0200 myr ago .",
    "recent high resolution observations have shown that the hi  in the mb has a complex and chaotic filamentary structure ( muller et al .",
    "apparently coherent hi  features are identifiable across the entire range of observed angular scales , from @xmath098@xmath1  up to @xmath07@xmath2 , although the filamentary component is clearly unevenly distributed throughout the entire mb region .",
    "statistical techniques are a useful means to compare populations of similar objects in different systems , understand and model general properties and behaviors , and expose and isolate any hidden underlying trends within a dataset . in particular , statistical analyses provide some of the most useful descriptions of turbulent flows .",
    "the results of statistical analyses of emission - line data sets can be directly compared with theoretical predictions to determine the properties of the turbulence under that theoretical framework . while there are many statistical techniques that have been used to analyze different data sets , this paper focuses on two complimentary methods : the spatial power spectrum ( sps ) and the spectral correlation function ( rosolowsky et al , 1999 ) .",
    "the sps and the scf were chosen because they highlight the importance of structure across a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "the organisation of spatial scales has a direct influence on the efficiency of energy transport throughout the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the subject system and also vice versa : the transport of energy is an important operator on the arrangement and distribution of spatial scales .    the relationship between the observed sps and the characteristics of the underlying turbulent flows has been the work of several theoretical studies ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; goldman 2000 ; miville - deschenes et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in contrast with the sps which measures structure of data sets on a more global scale , the scf measures local variations as a function of spatial scale .    no studies have yet made a direct and dedicated comparison of the outcomes and predictions of the sps and the scf .",
    "measurements of the scf on the hi  of the lmc ( padoan et al .",
    "2001 ) were shown to be in rough , though not particularly good agreement with earlier studies using the sps ( elmegreen et al .",
    "2001 ) and a more detailed discussion of the predictions of the scf in the context of the turbulent and small - scale structure of the lmc hi   were not entered into .    to date",
    ", studies of the sps have been made of hi  in the smc and the lmc ( stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999a ; stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "scf studies have been made only of the lmc ( padoan et al .",
    "these results have highlighted the existence of important active processes and structure trends within these systems and have been used as a quantifier for the organisation of structure within these systems independently .",
    "the mb forms a physical link between the smc and the lmc , and represents a feature which has evolved purely in response to tidal forces .",
    "the mb is therefore an ideal system to test and compare the response of the scf to a ) a system which has developed in response to large - scale forces and b ) in the context of the host systems , i.e. the smc and lmc .",
    "such an analysis may characterize the turbulence in tidal features in general and in addition , a comparison of the sps results derived for different components in the magellanic system can provide insights into different evolutionary paths for organization of hi  structures in an galactic versus an intergalactic medium .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the sps and scf . in section  [ sec : dataset ] we summarize the observations of the subject hi  mb dataset . sections  [ sec : sps ] and  [ sec : calculating scf ] detail the methodology and results of the calculation of the hi  sps and scf on the mb hidataset . sections  [ sec : sps_disc ] presents the discussion and interpretation of our results .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the sps has traditionally been applied to obtain a useful insight into hydrodynamics , mhd theory and turbulent motions ( e.g. lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) .",
    "for example , a shallow sps results from a system which is dominated by small - scale structure , while a steep sps results from a system which is dominated by large - scale fluctuations .",
    "the sps has been commonly applied on large datasets in an attempt to parameterise the structure hierarchy of the hi  in these systems .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "the sps is derived from the fourier transform power spectrum of an observed 2-d image , denoted @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spatial frequency .",
    "different types of observations commonly show that the sps of intensity fluctuations can be characterized by a power - law , or the sum of two power laws : @xmath5 the composite power law is observed when the dynamics of a system are shaped by a process ( or processes ) which generate excess power over a specific range of scales .",
    "for example , supernovae are capable of injecting power across scales of tens of parsecs .",
    "the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dependent on the relative importance of the two terms ( see also elmegreen & scalo , 2004 ; scalo & elmegreen , 2004 , for a detailed review of turbulent processes ) .    in the case of a kolmogorov - type of turbulent fluid ( isotropic and incompressible turbulence , characterized by energy injection on large scales with a dissipationless cascade of energy over intermediate scales and dissipation of energy only on smallest scales )",
    "the sps of both 3-d density and velocity fluctuations is a power law with a slope equal to @xmath8 .",
    "however , a spectral index of @xmath9 does not necessarily imply kolmogorov - like turbulence .",
    "recent work using simulated datasets have shown that other turbulent regimes are capable of producing spectral indices which are approximately equal to this value .",
    "for example , miville - deschnes , levrier & falgarone ( 2003 ) have developed synthetic fractal brownian motion ( fbm ) datasets which can yield spatial spectral indices of @xmath103.7 .",
    "furthermore , synthetic datasets containing randomly distributed , supernovae - driven expanding shells also appear to produce a kolmogorov spectrum ( hodge & deshpande , in preparation ) .",
    "both of these studies are in need of further clarification however , specifically in that the fbm set does not represent coherent turbulent structures ( i.e. it is constructed from brownian noise ) , and that the hodge & deshpande analysis involves unphysical formation processes ( i.e. they do not solve the hydrodynamic equations in the development of the set ) . to distinguish and disentangle the",
    "nature and extent of velocity fluctuations from static hierarchical density structure , techniques which measure the velocity statistics of the set must be used .    an important advantage",
    "the sps has over other statistical techniques is in relating statistics of the observed intensity fluctuations with the statistics of the underlying 3-d density and velocity fields .",
    "a recent development in sps studies involves the averaging of data across a number of observed velocity channels . by integrating a spectral - line data cube over varying ranges of velocity ,",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) showed that it is possible to disentangle the influences of density and velocity fluctuations in the turbulent flow , i.e. the power - law index is a function of both the velocity , and the velocity width of the observations : @xmath11 .",
    "when an image is generated from a small range in velocities ( small @xmath12 ) , a significant fraction of the observed structure results from the velocities of the turbulent flow moving emission into different velocity channels . since an sps",
    "is usually inferred to characterize the density fluctuations in a turbulent flow , the velocity fluctuations would corrupt the results .",
    "however , when integrated over a large velocity range ( large @xmath13 ) , most of the velocity fluctuations average out , leaving only static density fluctuations . by measuring the power law spectrum over a range of widths in the velocity window ,",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) showed that it was possible to separate the power - law spectrum of the density fluctuations from those of the velocity fluctuations . in their velocity channel analysis ( vca ) , they refer to the regime where the velocity thickness of the integrated slice averages out the velocity fluctuations as the `` thick slice regime '' and the opposite regime where the velocity fluctuations are important as the `` thin slice regime '' .",
    "as the sps is derived from the fourier transform of the data set , information from the entire image contributes to the power spectrum .",
    "however , this global approach compromises the usefulness of the sps in isolating local features in the data .",
    "by contrast , the scf does not transform the data and operates on entire _ spectra _ in a data cube instead of entire images .",
    "the scf parameterizes the ` similarity ' , @xmath14 , between two spectra as a function of their spatial separation , @xmath15 and often shows a power - law relationship @xmath16 over a range of separations ( e.g. padoan , rosolowsky & goodman , 2001 ) .",
    "the scf is normalized so that a perfect match between two spectra will yield a value of @xmath17 , and a value of zero is obtained for no similarity , or for an anti - correlation . since this technique does not use a fourier transform it does not require the data to be edge tapered and thereby reduces problems arising from the finite sampling and the associated edge effects . therefore , the minimum size of the region that may be sampled with this technique is much smaller than that available to the power spectrum analysis .",
    "however , the scf is sensitive to the noise in the data cube and its application is limited to high signal - to - noise data .",
    "the early forms of the scf technique were used to derive an estimate of spectral similarity over a lag range which was defined by the velocity dispersion of the spectra of interest .",
    "it was therefore limited to data cubes that were described by a simple , single velocity component .",
    "later modifications to the scf made by padoan , rosolowsky & goodman ( 2001 ) included a parameter which weights the function by the ratio of the rms of the signal and noise .",
    "these modifications improved the ability of the algorithm to handle noise and expanded its application to more complex and multi - component spectra and across any range of spatial lags ( padoan , rosolowsky & goodman 2001 ) .",
    "an interesting application of the scf was shown in the study by padoan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) where a break in the power - law behavior of the scf was interpreted as a signature of the lmc s disk thickness .    as the scf is a rather recent development , the relationship between the scf results and the properties of the observed turbulence",
    "are not understood as completely as for the sps .",
    "we have attempted here a more dedicated study and comparison of the the scf in the context of predictions from the relatively well - parameterized sps .",
    "we use the high - resolution hi  observations of muller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the present statistical investigation of the hi  distribution in the mb .",

    "the data were collected with both the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes telescope .",
    "the observing parameters , data reduction and data combination procedures are described in muller et al .",
    "the final hi  data cube has 1-@xmath23 brightness temperature sensitivity of @xmath00.9 k ( corresponding to a column density of @xmath01.62@xmath2410@xmath25 @xmath26 ) , a velocity resolution of @xmath01.6 , and an angular resolution of 98@xmath1 .",

    "an important note in the context of this work , is that the atca interferometer , being composed of discrete elements is not capable of uniformly sampling the entire uv plane .",
    "the missing data is extrapolated during the deconvolution and inversion process which also homogonises the sensitivities somewhat ( refer to muller et al .",

    "[ f : himap ] & [ f : vel - dec ] , indicates a turbulent and highly inhomogeneous morphology over the entire range of observed spatial and velocity scales .",

    "[ f : himap ] ) : the south east ( se ) , the north east ( ne ) , the north west ( nw ) and the south west ( sw ) .",
    "the sw region is dominated by bright , filamentary features across its entire extent .",
    "the hi  in the se region is similarly filamentary , although the spatial coverage of the brightest feature is less complete .",

    "as the telescope beam subtends approximately three image pixels , a new data cube was generated that sampled every third pixel in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 directions to ensure that the scf samples independent spectra .",
    "the two - dimensional sps used here is derived following methodologies used in previous studies ( crovisier & dickey 1983 ; green 1993 ; stanimirovi et al . 1999a ; stanimirovi & lazarian 2001 ; elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith 2001 ; dickey et al .",

    "the interferometric ( atca ) part of this dataset has negligible non - circularity of the @xmath36 sampling function ( see also muller et al .",

    "the median hi  column density for the final hi  data cube is quite low ( @xmath04@xmath2410@xmath37 @xmath26 ) , so any corrections for self - absorption are unnecessary ( see discussion by minter 2002 ) .",
    "we emphasise that this dataset is a combination of observations obtained with the parkes single - dish telescope and with the atca interferometer .",

    "we see that the contribution of power to the sps from the noise component of the hi  dataset is negligible at low spatial frequencies ( by a factor of 10@xmath43/10@xmath440.03 at @xmath45700@xmath46 ) and is important only at the largest spatial frequencies ( @xmath47 ) . as these frequencies",
    "are usually compromised by the atca beam , they are already excluded from the fit .",

    "[ f : gamvel ] .",
    "the left axis corresponds to the power - law index @xmath52 , while the right axis shows the mean integrated hi  brightness temperature for a given velocity channel .",
    "the power - law index generally varies significantly with velocity , even over the velocity channels with the brightest hi  emission .",
    "the nature of this variation is different in the different quadrants .",
    "this large variation in @xmath52 contrasts to that which was found for the hi  in the relatively homogeneous smc : stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 1999a ) measured no dramatic or large changes in the power - law index across the entire ( @xmath0200 ) velocity range .",
    "this has important ramifications in the next part of the sps analysis , where the fundamental assumption is that the structure of the set under study is largely homogeneous throughout the velocity range of the data .    to some extent , the plots of fig .",
    "[ f : gamvel ] suggest a relationship between the mean brightness temperature and the index of the power - law , in that a hight mean t@xmath53 is associated with a steeper power spectrum .",
    "this is can be seen for velocity channels where the mean @xmath542k or so .",
    "this effect is primarily a manifestation of the increasing relative importance of the noise component : for channels where t@xmath53 is low , the spectrum becomes whiter ( i.e. the spectrum flattens ) .    in the case of the sw region ,",
    "the variation of t@xmath53 is very large and we see that the variations of t@xmath53 are not reflected by similar variations of @xmath55 , which appears to have a limiting slope of approximately @xmath103 .",
    "this is close to that expected from a kolmogorov flow .",
    "we now investigate the extent to which velocity fluctuations affect the apparent sps of the hi  intensity distribution by applying the vca technique ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) to hi  data cube subsets averaged over a range of velocity intervals , which is just the measurement of @xmath56 .",
    "as the vca technique assumes that the morphology of the original dataset is quite homogeneous over the velocity range of interest , we will apply the vca analysis only over selected contiguous velocity windows for which the sps index is approximately constant to facilitate comparison with theoretical models . in doing so",
    ", we avoid mixing kinematically different regions .",
    "unfortunately , choosing velocity windows limits the available velocity thickness range considerably .",

    "we selected regions with roughly constant @xmath57 and mean hi  brightness temperature ( @xmath58 4 k ) as a sample of relatively homogeneous regions .",
    "there is no usefully large velocity range over which the power - law index is particularly constant in the nw region , so we do not attempt to measure @xmath56 in this subregion .",
    "quantitatively , the ranges selected for each region follow : + north west : none + north east : 196  230 + south west : 143  203 + south east : 156  194 +    the variation of the sps power - law index as a function of velocity slice thickness for the three regions is shown in fig .  [ f : gamdv ] . generally , @xmath56 becomes steeper with increasing velocity thickness for all three regions .",
    "this trend agrees with predictions by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) and suggests that both density and velocity fluctuations contribute to the measured hi  intensity fluctuations for thin slices .",
    "the selected range of velocity channels for the se region is narrower than that of the sw region ; however over the common range , @xmath56 is very similar .",
    "this suggests that turbulence has comparable characteristics in the two southern regions although , the power - law index derived for the ne region appears very different . over the whole range of @xmath13",
    "the slope for the ne region is significantly shallower than the slope of the southern regions .",
    "it is interesting to note that for all three regions @xmath56 starts to converge a constant value around @xmath59 .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) predicted that the presence of gas at different temperatures will show a characteristic ` turn - over ' in @xmath56 . this slight ` turn - over ' of @xmath55 , seen in fig .",
    "6 , around @xmath59 could be an indication of a significant contribution from warm gas with temperature @xmath60 k.    in contrast , we do not see a similar converging trend for small values of @xmath13 end of this plot .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) suggests that typically for cold hi  @xmath61  would be enough to approach the asymptotic value for ` thin ' slices ( our thinest channel is 1.65  wide ) .",
    "together with the observed turn - over at @xmath59 , the lack of convergence for small @xmath13 suggests that hi  in the mb is primarily in the warm neutral phase .",
    "however , absorption observations of a number of continuum sources throughout the mb made by kobulnicky & dickey ( 1999 ) , have revealed the presence of cold ( @xmath62 ) clouds .",
    "this cold phase is probably only a small fraction of the mb ism and as such , the mechanisms responsible for preserving the cold component in equilibrium with the warmer ambient ism remain to be explained .      by examining the power as a function of azimuthal angle , we can probe for any structure anisotropy of the mb hi  dataset .",
    "any such anisotropies will manifest in the fourier plane as significant structure as a function of phase , with excess power aligned aproximately in the direction perpendicular to that of the structure bias in the un - transformed image .",
    "such azimuthal anisotropy could result from directionally - specific peturbations , for example , the effects of a magnetic field ( esquivel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which may act to organise the ism by shaping the ionised or dusty component .",
    "[ f : power_azimuth ] shows the mean power as a function of azimuthal angle across spatial scales 100 - 600@xmath46 of the fourier transform for the hi  integrated intensity distribution of each of the four subregions .",

    "[ f : himap ] .",
    "it is likely that the dynamic range of any structure in the hiimages is insufficient to manifest as features in the fourier transform : for such a feature to be distinct it is necessary to have a power at least 23 orders of magnitude larger than the surrounding structure .",

    "2001 ) does not characterise the @xmath83 appropriately .",
    "as such , the right - hand panels of fig",
    ".  [ pixel_map ] show the behaviour of @xmath84 along the major and minor axes of the elliptical contours .",
    "the map is clearly anisotropic and indicates some structure bias present in the organisation of the gas in the mb .",
    "in particular , the major axes of the ellipses appear to be generally aligned with direction of filamentary structure in the mb .    in order to interpret the scf maps ,",
    "we have fitted an elliptical power - law function to the distribution .",
    "we modeled the typical @xmath14 surface using a function with parameters @xmath85 : @xmath86    this function characterises the @xmath14 surface with two separate power - laws falling off in orthogonal directions from @xmath87 with indices @xmath88 ( major axis ) and @xmath89 ( minor axis ) respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath90 represents the orientation of these axes with respect to the coordinate axes .",
    "the data @xmath91 are weighted inversely proportional to their distance from @xmath92 . the singularity at @xmath93 for negative values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is ignored .",
    "we fit the function @xmath94 to @xmath14 for every position that is completely sampled .",
    "padoan , goodman , & juvela ( 2003 ) point out a relationship between the power - law scaling of @xmath84 and the line width of the spectra considered .",
    "we find no such correlation present in the mb hi  data , however , the @xmath95co molecular cloud data used by padoan , goodman , & juvela ( 2003 ) are systems with well defined size  line width relationships and where such line profiles can typically be described with only a single component .",
    "in contrast , the hi  data used here are complex , and show multiple velocity components for any line - of - sight ( e.g. mcgee & newton , 1986 ; muller et al .",
    "2003 )    there is evidence for a correlation between the power - law index of the scf and the integrated intensity .",
    "this is most notable when step 3 of the scf processing is omitted and the major and minor axes are derived by fitting without averaging .",
    "[ int_scf ] shows this correlation with respect to the major axis index , @xmath88 , for all points outside the 21 pixel buffer at the edge of the map .",
    "the correlation is not outstanding , but appears to obey a power - law such that @xmath96 .",
    "padoan , rosolowsky , & goodman ( 2001 ) note that higher density gas appears to be traced by a steeper power - law slope",
    ". however , this effect may be due to different spatial distributions for different molecular tracers .",
    "we find that the sps of the hi  intensity distribution in the mb can be well described by a single power - law function over a wide range of spatial scales ( 29 pc to at least 2 kpc ) . as in the case of the smc ( stanimirovi et .",
    "al , 1999a , b ) , no significant changes to the power - law shape of the sps were found when varying heliocentric velocity or the thickness of velocity channels , though the power - law index varies significantly .",
    "this indicates that the mb is likely to have a large line - of - sight depth .",
    "in contrast , the sps derived from the hi  intensity distribution in the lmc showed a break at the spatial scale equivalent to @xmath0100 pc ( elmegreen , kim & staveley - smith , 2001 ) which was interpreted as evidence for the finite thickness of the lmc disk .",
    "however , the smc and the mb have large - scale morphologies which are distinctly different from the lmc , namely that they are not approximately face - on systems and have a substantial line - of - sight depth .",
    "there is a clear variation of @xmath56 over the range of velocity widths considered , and the ne section of the analysis has qualitatively different variation than the sw and se sections .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) relate the measured variations of @xmath56 to physical properties of the turbulence , a particular strength of sps analysis .",
    "in particular , @xmath97 can be related to the indices of the three - dimensional power spectra of the density and velocity fluctuations .",
    "if the density fluctuation power spectrum is a power law with index of @xmath98 and the velocity fluctuation power spectrum has an index of @xmath99 the relationships between @xmath55 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are given in table [ tab : lazarian ] for @xmath100 ( shallow 3-d density ) and @xmath101 ( steep 3-d density ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the steepening of the sps slope with increasing integrated velocity thickness , as predicted by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) , was also measured from hi  in the smc ( stanimirovi & lazarian 2001 ) and for a test region in the galaxy ( dickey et al .",
    "table 2 shows that the slopes for the southern two regions in the mb are generally similar to those derived for the smc which has a @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ) .",
    "both the smc and the mb appear to have power - law indices that are more shallow that what is predicted for a kolmogorov turbulent spectrum . for the case of hi  in the galaxy a shift of the sps slope from about @xmath103 to @xmath104 after velocity integration was noticed by dickey et al .",
    "other studies of the lmc ( elmegreen , kim & staveley - smith 2001 ) and the magellanic stream ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "2002 ) also show apparent steepening of the power spectra with increasing integrated velocity thickness .",
    "a different interpretation of the power - law sps in the case of the smc was provided by goldman ( 2000 ) whereby a featureless sps was interpreted as a signature of turbulence being driven on spatial scales larger than the size of the smc .",
    "this turbulence was induced by local instabilities due to tidal interactions in the magellanic system .",
    "this approach also defines the relationship between the 2-d intensity and 3-d density statistics , where the power - law index of intensity fluctuations , @xmath55 , is related to the power - law index of density fluctuations , @xmath98 , by @xmath104 . in the mb case studied here",
    ", this approach will result in @xmath105 for the southern two regions , and @xmath106 for the north - east region .",
    "the second important result from these studies of the mb , is that the slopes of the sps derived for the northern and southern regions appear to be strikingly different : the northern part shows a distinctly shallower ( although still monotonic ) power spectrum , indicating a relative lack of large - scale power ( or equivalently , an excess of small scale power ) .",
    "furthermore , these results could be interpreted as evidence for a warm ( @xmath010@xmath107 k ) component .",
    "this is slightly perplexing , given the results of absorption detections which indicate the presence for a very cool ( @xmath020 k ) component .",
    "muller et al . ( 2003 ) have observed that at least two distinctly different hi  velocity components exist throughout the mb , being centered on about 150 and 190  ( see also fig .",
    "[ f : vel - dec ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the two components are distinct in declination : the higher velocity component is predominantly at northerly declinations and is sampled by the ne and nw regions , while the lower velocity component is sampled by the se and sw regions .    numerical simulations ( gardiner , sawa & noguchi , 1994 ) suggest that the two velocity components could be associated with arms extending from the smc . in this model ,",
    "the more distant arm is projected as a higher velocity and slightly northern feature , while the nearer arm correlates with lower velocity component .",
    "the nearer arm is clearly contiguous with the smc and lmc may be more properly regarded as the magellanic bridge. the distances to these two arms have been predicted by gardiner , sawa & noguchi ( 1994 ) to be centered at 50 and 70 kpc , with an expected line - of - sight depth for both entities of @xmath0510 kpc .",
    "we propose that as an explanation for the differences in the behavior of the power indices of the northern and southern regions in figs .",
    "[ f : gamvel ] & [ f : gamdv ] , these regions encompass two separate and distinct arms of the smc .",
    "we view the arms projected approximately on top of one another , whereas these features are not well spatially connected at all .      like the sps",
    ", the scf shows a logarithmic dependence of scale which can be parameterised with a single component .",
    "we do not expect the slopes of the scf and sps to be consistent , since the sps probes structure in excess of the mean , large scale power ( i.e. that represented by the zero lag ) , whereas the scf algorithm , as used here and by padoan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , does not factor for a mean brightness level which will otherwise tend to flatten the scf slope .",
    "interestingly , the scf slopes derived here for the mb dataset are largely consistent with those derived from the hi  in the lmc ( @xmath1080.15 - @xmath100.4 ; padoan et al , 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of radial symmetry in the maps of @xmath14(*@xmath71r * ) is itself an interesting result .",
    "it appears then that the scf is more successful in detecting structure trends over a smaller dynamic range than the approach using the fourier transform and the sps in section  [ sec : sps ] .",
    "the obvious structure in the approximate east - west direction ( i.e. the line joining the smc and lmc ) indicates a more persistent similarity of spectra along that direction .",
    "what we see here is that the rate of change of the entire _ spectra _ ( rather than a single velocity channel , or integrated brightness ) across the entire sampled velocity range is more gradual in the east - west direction than in the north - south direction .",
    "we interpret the east - west @xmath14(*@xmath71r * ) structure as a result of the tidal stretching imposed by the lmc - smc interaction , although in this case the morphology of the hi  is already visually suggestive of this process .",
    "we should also bear in mind that the brightest parts of the dataset can dominate the scf results , biasing steeper power - law indices and the overall structure of the scf maps .",
    "a floating temperature scaling factor in the scf algorithm would probably go some way to removing this bias .",
    "we note that there is _ no _ evidence for a break in the bridge scf power law , as was found for the lmc at @xmath0100 pc , although these two objects are widely separated in space and there is no outstanding reason that they should share a common morphology at that scale .",
    "however , since a typical width of the structures in the filaments is @xmath39 pc in the plane of the sky , and we do not see a departure from a power law on this scale , this may be another indication of significant line - of - sight depth in the bridge .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ pixel_map ] that there may be some evidence for a consistent break in the power - law for both the major and the minor axes , at @xmath0300500 pc .",
    "however , this departure occurs at scales which are comparable to the maximum size of the tested areas ( i.e. @xmath0500 pc ) .",
    "the degree to which the boundary and size of the sample affects the scf has not been well studied , and it is probable that the departure is influenced by the edge of the sample region . as such ,",
    "any interpretation for the reasons of the observed departure at this scales should be made with caution .",
    "it is not appropriate to simply expand the spatial size of the sampled areas since this would sample data which is excessively dominated by noise and the scf algorithm will be affected unpredictably .    in this study",
    ", we did not attempt to study the behaviour of the scf in a similar way to that used by the velocity - component analysis ( vca ) , namely , measuring the modification to the scf as a function of varying velocity integrated width . as",
    "the scf operates in the image domain , we expect that by averaging across the velocity fluctuating component the scf will flatten somewhat , and that there will be some correlation of the scf slope with velocity integrated width .",
    "however , to conduct this test appropriately , a study with a well characterized dataset should be used , rather than the complex hi  profiles of magellanic bridge dataset .",
    "we have attempted two statistical analyses of the filamentary hi  in the magellanic bridge .",
    "together with the fact that there also appears to be an identifiable discontinuity in the velocity distribution of the hi  in the mb , the most significant result from the calculation of the spatial power spectrum ( sps ) here has provided support for a scenario suggested by numerical simulations , where the southern and northern parts of the bridge represent the projection of two distinct arms of gas emanating from the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "these findings suggest that we now need to re - assess the current interpretation of the bridge as a single filamentary feature .    similarly to the smc",
    ", the power spectra throughout the mb are well described as a power law with a single power component .",
    "in particular , the southern region which contains brighter and more turbulent hi , have 3-d density and velocity indices similar to that which was found for the smc .",
    "the more tenuous and higher velocity ( i.e. northern ) parts show a significantly shallower sps , with the 3-d density slope of @xmath109 .",
    "this is indicative of relatively quiescent gas .",
    "the 3-d velocity index ( @xmath110 ) of this region is significantly steeper that for the case of a kolmogorov turbulent flow .",
    "we find that the a velocity component analysis ( vca ) of the hi  in the mb behaves , on the whole , according to predictions by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) , where modifications to the power spectra by velocity fluctuations can be removed by integrating over a velocity window .",
    "this has again highlighted the dissimilarities between the northern and southern parts of the mb .",
    "the contributions by velocity fluctuations to the southern part of the mb are again similar to those in the smc , whereas the sps from the northern part of the mb shows evidence for a very steep three - dimensional velocity index and a lack of rapid velocity fluctuations .",
    "a study of the azimuthal isotropy of the fourier transform of the hidataset does not show any such east - west structure which is apparent in the hi  peak and integrated intensity maps .",
    "it is likely that the dynamic range of the fourier transformed dataset is insufficient to distinguish any such structure tends from the ambient hi .",
    "conversely , the spectral correlation function ( scf ) , due to the nature of the algorithm , is much more successful in indicating more subtle , local trends in structure .",
    "the analysis using the scf has shown more quantitatively the effects of tidal stretching on this dataset .",
    "it confirms that the observed hi  spectra in this region vary more slowly along the approximate direction of the tidal stretching .",
    "although limitations of the application of the scf has confined the region sampled to the brightest parts of the mb , the scf shows enormous potential as a tool for more easily parameterising suspect tidal features , insofar as the direction and extent of the tidal perturbation .",
    "although the behavior of the scf can not be directly related to the physical properties of the underlying turbulence , the scf provides some provocative results .",
    "we see that , like for the sps , the scf shows a power - law dependence with indices compatible with previous studies of the lmc hi  datset .",
    "however , the results from the scf analysis also hint at a characteristic scale length , which is not observed in the sps of the same region and are not at scales consistent with the studies of the lmc .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the departure observed here is at the limits of the sampled scale range and any interpretation should be made carefully .",
    "however , we can conclude that the scf and the sps do not appear to measure structure variations in the same way .",
    "specifically , the scf appears to be much more sensitive to low - power and small scale variations in structure .",
    "it will be necessary to explicitly test and compare behaviors of the scf and sps to different turbulence types before the full application of the scf can be recognized .",
