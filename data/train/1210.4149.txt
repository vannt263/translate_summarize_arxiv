    "wormholes are space - time geometries with a nontrivial topology , so that two regions of the universe are connected by a traversable throat ; the throat is a surface where the geodesics open up . following the first work by morris and thorne @xcite ,",
    "traversable wormholes have received considerable attention @xcite , because they would imply some notable consequences , as for example the possibility of time travel @xcite .",
    "however , the necessity of exotic matter ( i.e. matter not fulfilling the energy conditions ) , which seems unavoidable within the framework of general relativity , is a central objection against the actual existence of wormholes .",
    "this point has been carefully studied for wormholes of the thin - shell class @xcite , which are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds , so that exotic matter is restricted to a layer located at the throat .",
    "the geometrical aspects of topological defects as cosmic strings have been the object of a detailed study in the last three decades , mainly because they could have played an important role in structure formation in the early universe ; it was also noted that they could be observed by their gravitational lensing effects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , strings are the objects more seriously considered by present theoretical developments as the fundamental building blocks of nature .",
    "therefore , the interest in the gravitational effects of both fundamental and cosmic strings has been renewed in the last years ( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as a natural consequence ,",
    "cylindrically symmetric wormhole geometries , as those associated to cosmic strings , have been recently considered @xcite .",
    "thin - shell wormhole configurations associated to local and global cosmic strings have been studied in refs .",
    "in particular , the case of a cylindrical locally flat wormhole geometry with a deficit angle , associated to a straight gauge string , was treated in @xcite .    for any thin - shell wormhole , beyond the throat",
    "the geometry is locally indistinguishable from the metric from which the mathematical construction starts .",
    "for example , the space - time of the cylindrical wormhole studied in @xcite is locally the same of a cosmic string metric , and only the possibility to probe the global properties of the geometry would allow an observer to decide between both topologically different manifolds .",
    "our proposal is that , for any thin - shell wormhole , such a test of the global behaviour of the geometry can be provided by the electrostatics of such a simple system as a point charge : a gravitational field changes the electric field of a point charge so that a finite self - force appears . even though the equivalence principle states that , for a freely falling observer , near a point charge the maxwell equations of flat space - time hold , this does not mean that the solution of these equations must be locally the same for flat space - time : such a solution would not fulfill the correct boundary conditions in the infinity , that is , it would not have the asymptotic behaviour which results from the space - time curvature .",
    "hence , the solution which is asymptotically well behaved is locally different from that of flat space - time . in particular",
    ", the field is no more symmetric around the charge , and this leads to the existence of a self - force .",
    "now , the field is determined by the whole background geometry ; hence the topology , that is the existence or not of a wormhole throat , must be revealed by the associated electrostatic self - force .",
    "the calculation of the self - interaction starts from the maxwell equations for curved space - time @xcite ( with @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath4 is the four - potential , @xmath5 is the four - current and @xmath6 are the associated charges . for only one rest charge @xmath7 located at the point @xmath8",
    "we simply have @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the first case considered of a self - force of physical interest was a charge in a schwarzschild metric ; it was shown that the self - force on a point charge @xmath7 is repulsive and has the form f~ , where @xmath11 is the mass of the spherical source and @xmath12 is the usual schwarzschild radial coordinate of the probe charge .",
    "this result was first obtained within linearized general relativity @xcite , and was later confirmed working in the framework of the full theory ; see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "after these works , the study of the self - interaction of a charge was then extended to many geometries .",
    "in particular , the self - force on a charge in the locally flat geometry of a straight cosmic string was found by linet @xcite ; the force points outwards , and has the form f~ , where @xmath13 is the mass per unit length of the string and @xmath12 is the distance from the string to the charge .",
    "this nonvanishing force , which is associated to the deficit angle , illustrates how the global properties of a manifold are manifested by electrostatics .",
    "the problem of a charge in the non trivial topology of wormhole geometries was recently addressed in a set of works @xcite which in general agree in the interesting result of an attractive force , i.e. , a force towards the wormhole throat . here",
    "we will consider a cylindrical thin - shell wormhole which connects two identical locally flat geometries with a constant deficit angle .",
    "as pointed out above , this space - time is locally indistinguishable from the geometry around a gauge cosmic string .",
    "we will obtain the self - interaction for a point charge in such a wormhole geometry , thus providing a tool to probe the space - time beyond its local properties ; the result would allow an observer to decide whether the topology is trivial , as it would be in the case of a cosmic string , or it includes a throat , thus showing the existence of a cylindrical thin - shell wormhole .",
    "the calculation of the self - force on a charge in the space - time of a cylindrical thin - shell wormhole connecting two cosmic string geometries is best understood by proceeding in successive steps : we first illustrate how to obtain the electrostatic potential in minkowski space - time working in cylindrical coordinates ; then we consider the cosmic string case , and finally we study the charge in the wormhole geometry .",
    "this allows to easily separate the finite and divergent parts of the potential , which is a central point of the evaluation of the self - interaction , and to clearly understand the difference between the cosmic string and the wormhole results .",
    "minkowski space - time in cylindrical coordinates @xmath14 is described by the line element ds_m^2=-dt^2+dr^2+r^2d^2+dz^2 , where the ranges of the coordinates are : @xmath15 the maxwell equations for a static point charge located at @xmath16 in minkowski space - time give a^0=-(r - r)(-)(z - z ) for the zero component @xmath17 of the four - potential , where @xmath18 , while the other components of the four - potential vanish . hence in the minkowski background we have the poisson equation v_m = v_m= -(r - r)(-)(z - z ) .",

    "the result is best understood by plotting a numerical evaluation of the expressions above . in figs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) we show the self - force as a function of the distance from the charge to the wormhole throat ( normalized by the throat radius , so that @xmath79 corresponds to the location of the throat ) , for four different values of the constant @xmath28 , which is associated to the deficit angle . for the case of no deficit angle @xmath80",
    "the self - force is always attractive for any position of the charge ; for a small deficit ( @xmath81 ) at both sides of the throat , the self - force is also attractive up to very large distances from the throat to the charge but the numerical analysis shows that far enough ( @xmath82 ) , the repulsive force associated to the deficit angle becomes the dominant effect . on the other hand ,",
    "when two conical geometries with larger deficit angle are connected by the throat , we can easily see that the self - force points towards the throat for small distances , while it turns to be repulsive as the distance between the throat and the charge is increased ; the range such that the force points towards the throat is larger as the deficit angle decreases .",
    "such a transition from an attractive force to a repulsive one is a distinguishing feature of the wormhole geometry , because in the case of a cosmic string background the force is always repulsive .",

    "therefore the wormhole and the cosmic string geometries are locally indistinguishable . however , their global properties are different .",
    "one one hand , it is known that the self - force in the cosmic string background always pushes the particle away from the string . on the other hand",
    "we have obtained an analytical expression in the form of a series for the self - force in the wormhole geometry and we have shown numerically that the particle is repelled from the wormhole throat when placed beyond a certain distance from the throat , but otherwise it is attracted , as shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "this qualitative difference is the most important result of the present work , since it shows that the study of the electrostatics of point particles in a given geometry permits to distinguish whether the topology is trivial , as for the cosmic string , or it includes a throat , as for our cylindrical wormhole .",
    "it would be of special interest to generalize these results to the schwarzschild case , which is physically more interesting , though technically more complicated .",
    "we leave this task for a further publication .",
    "the expression for the electrostatic energy and self - force for a charge in the cosmic string manifold calculated by linet in @xcite are w_cs(r)= f^r_cs(r)= respectively , where l_b=_0^+ .",

    "the solution for ( [ mcsm ] ) that derives in ( [ ecs ] ) and ( [ fcs ] ) can be checked with linet s results ( [ elinet ] ) and ( [ linet ] ) .",

    "this electrostatic problem can be solved by the method of images if the space is extended to @xmath88 and another charge @xmath7 is located at the point @xmath89 .",
    "this is an equivalent problem because ( [ images ] ) and ( [ cci ] ) are satisfied in the region of interest .",
    "the electrostatic energy of the original charge @xmath7 is calculated with the potential @xmath90 generated by the image distribution .",
    "this electrostatic potential can be expanded in the same basis functions previously used in ( [ vm ] ) and replacing @xmath91 by @xmath92 , so that : w_cs^_0=(r)= v_q|_(r = r,=,z = z)= _ 0^+dk_n=0^+a_n ( -1)^n k_n(kr)i_n(kr ) the righthand side of ( [ ew1/2 ] ) is exactly what is obtained in ( [ ecs ] ) using @xmath85 . calculating the same energy by the usual potential expression for two point charges separated by a distance @xmath93 we have w_cs^_0=(r)= v_q(|r ) = , the same result obtained by linet in ( [ elinet ] ) putting @xmath85 ( so that @xmath94 ) .",
