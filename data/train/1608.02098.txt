    "<S> the present mesoscopic model with spatially extended friction may offer a computationally efficient tool for future simulations of water transport in nanomaterials .    </S>",
    "<S> water transport through graphene - derived membranes has recently captured much attention due to its promising potential for many technological applications , such as water filtration , separation processes , and heterogeneous catalysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a number of simulations have shown that fast water permeation through carbon materials , such as carbon nanotubes ( cnt @xcite ) and pristine graphene membranes @xcite is due to the slip flow at the water - carbon interface . </S>",
    "<S> fast water transport ( fwt ) with permeabilities higher than @xmath0 @xcite has also been reported for graphene oxide laminate ( gol ) . </S>",
    "<S> + however , in contrast to pristine graphene and cnt , a clear consensus on the gol fast water transport mechanism has yet to emerge @xcite . to date , </S>",
    "<S> departures from hydrodynamic ( i.e. , hagen - poiseuille ) behavior are typically attributed to the low friction experienced by water in atomistically smooth graphene nanochannels @xcite or to the presence of structural defects in gol , leading to shorter water paths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter hypothesis is further corroborated by the breakdown of fwt from molecular interactions of water with basal plane hydroxide and epoxide groups , which hinders the motion of water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was recently reported in non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of flows inside graphene oxide ( go ) nanochannels , @xcite . under such conditions , </S>",
    "<S> slip - corrected continuum hydrodynamics is expected to provide a correct description of the aforementioned transport mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the hydrodynamic level the details of the slip corrections must be imposed a priori because the physics of slip flow is governed by non - equilibrium phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> such details can certainly be accounted for by a fully atomistic approach , but at the price of prohibitive computational costs . </S>",
    "<S> all of the above lead to an ideal scenario for _ mesoscale _ modeling techniques , which may offer a valuable compromise between physical fidelity and computational viability , @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath2 of the sonicated go solution was deposited on a porous polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane ( pore size = @xmath3 ) via vacuum filtration . </S>",
    "<S> the membranes were then characterized by using a zeiss ultra field emission scanning electron microscope ( sem ) with an in - lens detector ( see figure s1 and s2 in the supporting information ) </S>",
    "<S> . scanning electron microscopy and mass analysis suggest the formation of a circa @xmath4 thick go layer on top of the pvdf membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallographic structure of the membranes was analyzed with a bruker d8 equipped with a two - dimensional vantec-500 detector . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were obtained by the integration of the 2d diffraction pattern image ( see figure s3 in the supporting information ) via eva software . depending on the sample , the integration time was between 600 - 1200 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> permeability results were carried out with a custom - made dead - end filtration system operating at a maximum pressure of @xmath5 . in particular , a @xmath6 in diameter go membrane was cut and placed in a stainless steel edm millipore filter holder . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure was monitored with an ingersoll pressure gauge regulator ( see figure s4 in the supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations are based on the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method , augmented with a novel langevin - like frictional force accounting for the go - water interactions . </S>",
    "<S> since the lb method is largely documented in the literature @xcite , in the following we discuss only its basic features . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice boltzmann equation reads as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a set of discrete probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) representing the probability of finding a molecule at position @xmath9 and time @xmath10 with a lattice - constrained velocity @xmath11 , where the index @xmath12 runs over the nine directions of the lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the set of discrete local maxwellian equilibria ( i.e. , truncated low - mach number expansion of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) @xcite and @xmath14 is the speed of sound of the model @xcite . in the above equation , </S>",
    "<S> the left hand side is the lattice transcription of molecular free - flight along the lattice directions , while the right hand side describes collisional relaxation towards local equilibrium , described by a low - mach number expansion of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation parameter @xmath15 controls the kinematic viscosity of the lattice fluid through the relation @xmath16 in lattice units @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term , @xmath18 , is the correction due to the friction exerted by the hydroxyl and epoxy ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> hydroxyl]b ) on the water molecules and can be expressed as : @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the set of weights for the chosen lattice @xcite , and the frictional force is taken in the following langevin form @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fluid density and velocity respectively and the heterogeneous friction coefficient reads as follows : @xmath24 where w is a representative size of the protruding functional groups and @xmath25 is a characteristic water - hydroxyl collision frequency , taken equal to @xmath26 ( in lattice units ) in all the simulations , corresponding to a collision rate of about @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wall function @xmath28 takes the value @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath31 elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the reference case is @xmath34 ( truncated langevin throughout the text ) . in this case , if @xmath35 , the langevin force drops discontinuously to zero in the central region of the channel , w@xmath36w . </S>",
    "<S> to regularise this discontinuity , we also consider the case @xmath37 ( non - truncated langevin ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical idea behind the langevin - like frictional force is to account for the complex water - go molecular interactions at a coarse - grained level , whereby all atomistic details are channeled into the parameters @xmath25 and w.    whether the contact angle and the slip length can be treated as independent variables , still is an open question in the current literature ( see @xcite ) . in line with the mesoscale nature of our model , we assume sufficient universality to support a direct correlation between the water - graphene contact angle and the slip length . </S>",
    "<S> this said , from the nemd results ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4d in @xcite ) , we read off a slip length between @xmath38 with a @xmath39 @xmath40 to 5@xmath40 of hydroxyl groups , respectively . according to the authors , these values correspond to a contact angle @xmath41 , with 20@xmath40 hydroxyl groups and a @xmath42 slip length in pristine graphene . based on these data </S>",
    "<S> , it is reasonable to assume that the slip length should be of the order of the molecular size of the hydroxyl groups ( @xmath43 ) , which is precisely the assumption made in our model . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological approach allows us to import knowledge at the microscale within a mesoscale computational harness . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the model permits us to reach space - time scales of experimental relevance without being tied - down to the continuum assumptions the lattice units are @xmath44 , yielding a time step @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> note that sub - molecular spatial resolutions are typical of lb simulations of nanoflows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time - step , however is about an order of magnitude larger then the time steps typically used in md simulations of flows through go interlayers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth mentioning that the cpu time needed to update a single molecule is significantly larger than the one required to advance a single lb cell , because the cell contains less neighbours and , more importantly , such neighbours are fixed in space , hence there is no need to recompute the interaction list at every time - step . </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , lb requires no statistical averaging , since it is based on a pre - averaged probability distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , lb is often more efficient than computational fluid dynamics because i ) pressure is available locally in space and time , with no need of solving a demanding poisson problem , ii ) transport is exact , since free - streaming proceeds along fixed molecular velocities instead of space - time dependent material streamlines , iii ) diffusion is emergent , hence it does not require second order spatial derivatives , thus facilitating they formulation of boundary conditions in confined flows @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * results . * assuming the gol structure to be symmetric and periodic @xcite ( see red area in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ hydroxyl]a ) , we consider only two nanochannels out of the full device . a similar geometry set - up has been recently employed to investigate water permeation through graphene - based membranes by means of md simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two channels are connected via two openings of half the width of the inlet / outlet pores ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the molecules experience the langevin friction previously described .     and channel spacing @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the permeate increases linearly with time , thus denoting a hydrodynamic ( darcy - like ) behaviour of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> see also the flow rate vs the pressure gradient plot reported in figure s5 of the supplementary information , reporting a linear behaviour typical of the hydrodynamic regime . </S>",
    "<S> dashed line indicates the compaction time of the membrane . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have run several simulations with different values of w. the grid resolution is @xmath47 , corresponding to a flake length of @xmath48 , which we take as a representative experimental value , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mesoscale model was tested against experimental measurements of permeability . </S>",
    "<S> the permeability of the membrane is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath51 the pressure gradient across the membrane and @xmath52 the superficial velocity defined as the ratio between the membrane discharge per unit area . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth recalling that in the darcy regime , the permeability @xmath53 is pressure independent ( see figure s5 in the supporting information ) . in order to test our numerical results against experimental data , we inferred the experimental values of flow rates ( mass flow per unit time ) from the permeate vs time plot , reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ permeate ] , for different values of the applied pressure . from these data , we compute a dimensionless permeability @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents the spacing between two go layers . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction measurements give @xmath56 . the experimental value of the dimensionless permeability @xmath57 for a @xmath58 thick membrane of diameter @xmath59 is @xmath60 , corresponding to a permeability of @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> this value of permeability is in line with data previously reported for ultrathin ( @xmath62 ) go membranes ( see @xcite ) and represents a promising result for nanofiltration applications . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to underline that higher values of permeability have been achieved for go membranes . </S>",
    "<S> however , these values can be connected to the presence of defects or larger go nanochannels due to the chemical modification of the go membranes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> higher permeability can also be achieved by intercalating the go membranes with high aspect ratio nanoarchitectures , such as cnt @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kappa ] illustrates two comparisons , for both the truncated and non - truncated langevin frictions : i ) between the permeability obtained by mesoscopic simulations and experiments ; ii ) between the slip length obtained by nemd @xcite and by this study . </S>",
    "<S> the case w@xmath63 corresponds to a simulation without the langevin friction , i.e. pure _ free - slip _ hydrodynamics . by free - slip we mean boundary conditions which leave the flow momentum tangential to the wall unchanged </S>",
    "<S> this is representative of the fwt regime observed in pristine graphene experiments . </S>",
    "<S> note that the flow still reaches a steady - state solution on account of the localized dissipation experienced at the sharp @xmath64 turns between two subsequent layers , visible in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ hydroxyl]c . the main outcome from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kappa ] is a dramatic drop in permeability of two orders of magnitude , already at w@xmath65 , i.e. w@xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> such a dramatic drop in permeability is consistent with experimental observations that report a suppression of fwt regimes in the presence of hydroxyl groups . </S>",
    "<S> further increments of w lead to a sizable reduction in permeability by circa one order of magnitude , from w@xmath67 to w@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that , the employed resolution ( @xmath69 ) poses a constraint on the lower bound of w. we note that the truncated ( @xmath70 , @xmath34 ) and non - truncated ( @xmath71 , @xmath37 ) scenarios yield nearly the same picture with only minor quantitative variations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kappa ] shows that for both the truncated and non - truncated scenario , the slip length remains between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in agreement with the values provided by nemd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the best match of the experimental ( permeability ) and nemd ( slip lengths ) results with the simulations is obtained when w is between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( i.e. w@xmath76 ) , which agrees with the physical dimension of the oxygen functionalities in the go nanochannels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this further corroborates the validity of the model and its potential to capture the physical phenomena in 2d nanostructured inspired materials within an efficient computational framework .    </S>",
    "<S> * inside the flow structure . * </S>",
    "<S> next , we proceed to inspect the internal structure of the flow . in particular , we focus on the occurrence of slip flow in the presence of hydroxyl , as recently observed in non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . as previously discussed , slip flow is a typical manifestation of individual non - hydrodynamic behavior driven by non - equilibrium effects near the wall . to glean quantitative insights into such non - equilibrium phenomena is informative for inspecting the one - dimensional cross - flow profiles @xmath77 for different values of w versus the case of free - slip boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ flowprofiles]a illustrates that the flow profiles display a poiseuille - like parabolic trend in the bulk region , smoothly turning into a flat profile near the wall , with a positive curvature and a small non - zero slip velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the pristine graphene profile with the other profiles highlights the major drop of mass flow due to langevin friction . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of w leads to the suppression and flattening of the water profiles . from the velocity profiles , we compute the slip length according to @xmath78 . as previously discussed for fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kappa ] , we confirm the presence of a residual slip length , which is small in absolute physical units , but fairly sizable in units of the channel width @xmath79 , namely @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the effect of the different cut - off lengths employed in the truncated @xmath81 and non - truncated @xmath82 langevin is minor , leading to slight differences in both the membrane permeability and slip lengths . to further test the robustness of this approach in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ flowprofiles](b ) we report a comparison between the velocity profiles obtained by the langevin - lb and the md approach @xcite for a @xmath83 wide go channel , showing an outstanding agreement between the two models .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this letter with an ex - post analysis of our mesoscale model in light of the numerical results discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that although both friction and viscous dissipation withstand the driving action of the pressure gradient , they operate according to very different and competing mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> friction drives the fluid towards the following local flow configuration : @xmath84 this results in a slip - flow @xmath85 ( independent of w ) at the wall and the corresponding slip length is @xmath86w . </S>",
    "<S> viscous dissipation , on the other hand , drives the fluid towards a parabolic hagen - poiseuille profile , @xmath87.\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the above hydrodynamic solution is compatible with either slip or non - slip flow conditions , depending on the value of the constant at the right hand side . in slip - hydrodynamics @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 recovers standard no - slip hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this value can only be prescribed a - priori , exposing the weakness of the hydrodynamic approach previously mentioned .    </S>",
    "<S> the two profiles , @xmath91 and @xmath92 can not coexist other than in an intermediate compromising form , resulting from the smoothing of the langevin profile due to viscous dissipation . to gain a deeper understanding , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figforce ] we report the friction and viscous forces separately , for the case w@xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , the bulk flow is dominated by viscous dissipation ( friction is zero in the bulk because @xmath94 ) , while in the vicinity of the wall , friction takes over . </S>",
    "<S> however , the two contributions become comparable but opposite in sign due to the positive curvature of the flow profile . </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked through separate simulations that the sign inversion of hydrodynamic dissipation holds true at higher resolution ( see fig . [ flowprofiles](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inversion of the dissipative force , namely @xmath95 at the wall is a genuine effect of the spatially distributed decaying langevin friction . indeed , since the free - slip boundary condition forces @xmath96 , the near - wall dissipative force is dominated by the langevin friction , which is incompatible with @xmath97 . since langevin friction decays exponentially away from the wall , the near - wall flow profile must grow exponentially according to eq.[ul ] , thus exhibiting the observed inverted ( positive ) curvature . </S>",
    "<S> because of the exponential decay of the extended friction , the bulk region is still dominated by viscous dissipation , as reflected by the bulk parabolic profile clearly visible in fig.[figforce ] . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the inverted curvature is a distinctive signature of the coexistence between single particle langevin friction ( slip - flow ) and collective hydrodynamics ( bulk flow ) . differently from continuum methods , which impose the slip length through the boundary conditions , in our model it naturally emerges from the self - consistent competition between extended friction and hydrodynamic dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this extra - freedom is key to recover the inverted curvature profile .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions . * in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations portray the following picture . </S>",
    "<S> even a small amount of spatially extended langevin friction , w@xmath66 , leads to a dramatic drop in the mass flow compared to free - slip hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> such friction still supports a small residual slip - flow at the wall , with a slip length of the order of the friction length w. however , this flow is largely negligible compared to the free - slip in the absence of langevin friction . </S>",
    "<S> the net result is a dramatic loss of permeability due to the presence of the functional groups , hence the inhibition of the fwt regime observed in pristine graphene membranes . </S>",
    "<S> viscous effects dominate the bulk flow and contribute to the smoothing of the sharp features of the flow due to the presence of the hydroxyl and epoxy . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the flow structure reveals an inverted curvature in the near - wall region , which connects smoothly with a parabolic profile in the bulk region such inverted curvature is a distinctive signature of the coexistence between single particle langevin friction and collective hydrodynamics . </S>"
