    "the name `` random laser '' made its appearance a few years ago @xcite , in connection with experiments on amplifying random media @xcite .",

    "laser action requires gain and feedback . in any laser ,",
    "gain results from stimulated emission of radiation by atoms in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "the random laser differs from a conventional laser in that the feedback is provided by multiple scattering from disorder rather than by confinement from mirrors . because of the randomness , there is no geometry - dependent shift of the laser line with respect to the atomic transition frequency ( hence the potential as a frequency standard ) .",
    "stellar atmospheres may form a naturally occuring realization of a random laser @xcite .",
    "possible applications as `` paint - on lasers '' @xcite have sparked an intensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the interplay of multiple scattering and stimulated emission .",
    "the topic has been reviewed by wiersma and lagendijk ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and these proceedings ) .",
    "a particularly instructive experiment @xcite was the demonstration of the narrowing of the coherent backscattering cone as a result of stimulated emission below the laser threshold .",

    "classical _ optics , as opposed to quantum optics , because stimulated emission can be described by a classical wave equation .",
    "( what is needed is a dielectric constant with a negative imaginary part . )    in a recent work @xcite we went beyond classical optics by studying the photodetection statistics of amplified spontaneous emission from a random medium .",
    "spontaneous emission , as opposed to stimulated emission , is a quantum optical phenomenon that can not be described by a classical wave equation . in this contribution",
    "we review our theory , with several extensions ( notably in secs .",

    "[ quantization ] with a discussion of the quantization of the electromagnetic field in absorbing or amplifying media .",

    "the central formula of this section is a fluctuation - dissipation relation , that relates the commutator of the operators describing the quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field to the deviation @xmath4 from unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath0 of the system .",

    "this spectral average is the absorptivity of the medium , being the fraction of the radiation incident in @xmath15 modes that is absorbed .",

    "( in the case of the cavity , @xmath15 is the number of transverse modes in the opening . )",
    "it is unusual , but essential , that all the emitted radiation is incident on the photodetector .",
    "we show that if only a single mode is detected , the counting distribution contains solely information on the absorptivity , while all information on higher spectral moments of the scattering strengths is lost .",
