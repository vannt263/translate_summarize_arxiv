    "the study of kinetic growth models such as directed percolation , eden growth , ballistic deposition , diffusion limited aggregation , random deposition with and without relaxation , cluster - cluster aggregation , etc .",
    ", is motivated by their interest in many areas of scientific research and technology such as polymer science , crystal and polycrystalline growth , gelation , fracture propagation , epidemic spreading , bacterial and fungi growth colonies , colloids , etc . @xcite . within this context the eden model @xcite",
    "has become an archetype growth model .",
    "eden clusters are compact but the self - affinity that characterizes the behavior of the growing interface is of much interest ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "few years ago ausloos et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced an additional degree of freedom to the eden model , namely the spin of the added particles .",
    "more recently , the eden growth of clusters of charged particles has also been studied @xcite .    in the magnetic eden model ( mem )",
    "@xcite with spins having two orientations ( up and down ) the growth of the cluster starts from a single seed , e.g. a spin up seed , placed at the center of the two - dimensional square lattice , whose sites are labelled by their rectangular coordinates @xmath5 . then",
    ", the growth process of the resulting magnetic cluster consists in adding further spins to the growing cluster taking into account the corresponding interaction energies . by analogy to the ising model @xcite one takes @xmath6 as the coupling constant between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins @xmath7 and the energy @xmath8 is then given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 means that the summation is taken over occupied nn sites .",
    "the spins can assume two values , namely @xmath11 . throughout this work we set the boltzmann constant equal to unity ( @xmath12 )",
    ", we consider @xmath13 ( i.e. , the ferromagnetic case ) and we take the absolute temperature @xmath14 measured in units of @xmath6 . in the mem a spin is added to the cluster with a probability proportional to the boltzmann factor exp@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total energy change involved . it should be noted that at each step all sites of perimeter are considered and the probabilities of adding up and down spins have to be evaluated . after proper normalization of the probabilities the growing site and the orientation of the spin",
    "are determined through a pseudo - random number generator .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mem has originally been motivated by the study of the structural properties of magnetically textured materials @xcite . while these previous studies of the mem were mainly devoted to determine the lacunarity exponent and the fractal dimension of the set of parallel oriented spins @xcite , the aim of the present work is to complement these previous investigations by studying the critical behavior of the mem using extensive monte carlo simulations and applying a finite - size scaling theory .",
    "also , our study is performed in confined ( stripped ) geometries which resemble recent experiments where the growth of quasi - one - dimensional strips of fe on a cu(111 ) vicinal surface @xcite and fe on a w(110 ) stepped substratum @xcite have been performed .",
    "in fact , the preparation and characterization of magnetized nanowires is of great interest for the development of advanced microelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the growth of metallic multilayers of ni and co separated by a cu spacer layer has recently been also studied @xcite .",
    "another goal of the present work is to compare the results obtained for the mem with the well known behavior of the classical ising model @xcite , an archetypical model in the study of thermally driven ( reversible ) phase transitions in equilibrium systems .",
    "the ising hamiltonian @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath10 means that the summation runs over all nn sites , @xmath19 is the state of the spin at the site of coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the coupling constant ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the mem is also similar to a family of models for the stochastic growth of crystals generically known as crystal growth models ( cgm ) @xcite , for a review see e.g. @xcite . as in the mem , in the case of cgm each atom",
    "is adsorbed with a given probability conditional to the actual configuration of neighboring atoms on the previous layer(s ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the mem , the crystal is supposed to grow layer after layer .",
    "it should also be noticed that relationships established between cgm and a special class of ising models @xcite have allowed to derive exact results .",
    "therefore , useful comparisons with the mem will be also discussed in the presentation of our results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give details on the simulation method , section 3 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results obtained for the mem in @xmath20-dimensions , while section 4 refers to results corresponding to @xmath21-dimensions . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "detailed discussions comparing our results with the behavior of the ising magnet are outlined .",
    "finally our conclusions are stated in section 5 .",
    "the mem in @xmath22dimensions is studied in the square lattice using a rectangular geometry @xmath23 with @xmath24 and imposing periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath25direction .",
    "the location of each site on the lattice is specified through its rectangular coordinates @xmath5 , ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the starting seed for the growing cluster is a column of parallel oriented spins placed at @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noticed that previous simulations of the mem were restricted to rather modest cluster sizes , i.e. containing up to 8000 spins @xcite , while in the present work clusters having up to @xmath29 spins have been typically grown .",
    "we have also studied the mem in @xmath30dimensions employing a @xmath31 geometry ( @xmath24 ) with periodic boundary conditions along both @xmath25directions .",
    "magnetic eden clusters grown on a stripped geometry of finite linear dimension @xmath33 at low temperatures show an interesting behavior that we call magnetization reversal .",
    "in fact , we have observed that long clusters are constituted by a sequence of well ordered magnetic domains .",
    "spins belonging to each domain , of average length @xmath34 , have mostly the same orientation and consecutive domains have opposite orientation .",
    "let @xmath35 be the characteristic length for the occurrence of the magnetization reversal .",
    "since @xmath36 , we then conclude that the problem has two characteristic length scales , namely @xmath37 and @xmath35 , such that @xmath38 .    in ordinary thermally driven phase transitions , the system changes from a disordered state at high temperatures to a spontaneously ordered state at temperatures below some critical value @xmath39 where a second - order phase transition takes place .",
    "regarding the ising model , one has that , in the absence of an external magnetic field ( @xmath40 ) , the low temperature ordered phase is a state with non - vanishing spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible in the thermodynamic limit only .",
    "in fact , it is found that the magnetization @xmath42 of a finite sample can pass with a finite probability from a value near @xmath43 to another near @xmath44 , as well as in the opposite direction .",
    "consequently , the magnetization of a finite system , averaged over a sufficiently large observation time , vanishes at every positive temperature .",
    "the equation @xmath45 holds if the observation time ( @xmath46 ) becomes larger than the ergodic time ( @xmath47 ) , which is defined as the time needed to observe the system passing from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "increasing the size of the sample the ergodic time increases too , such that in the thermodynamic limit ergodicity is broken due to the divergence of the ergodic time , yielding broken symmetry . since monte carlo simulations are restricted to finite samples , the standard procedure to avoid the problems treated in the foregoing discussion is to consider the absolute magnetization as an order parameter @xcite . turning back to the mem , we find that the phenomenon of magnetization reversal also causes the magnetization of the whole cluster to vanish at every non - zero temperature , provided that the length of the cluster @xmath50 ( which plays the role of @xmath46 ) is much larger than @xmath37 ( which plays the role of @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , we have measured the mean absolute column magnetization , given by @xmath51    in the stripped geometry used in this work the bias introduced by the lineal seed ( a starting column made up entirely of up spins ) can be avoided by calculating relevant properties after disregarding spins within a distance approximately equal to few times @xmath33 from the seed .",
    "the procedure of column averaging out from the transient region represents a significant advantage of the stripped geometry used for the simulation of the mem .",
    "in fact , when a single seed at the center of the sample is used , the definition of the average magnetization of the whole cluster is strongly biased by the cluster s kernel orientation at the early stages of the growing process .",
    "in addition , using several randomly generated seeds we could also establish that the system evolves into a given stationary state independently of the seed employed .",
    "= 4.0in=3.2 in    the mean column magnetization is a fluctuating quantity that can assume @xmath52 values .",
    "then , for given values of both @xmath33 and @xmath14 , the probability distribution of the mean column magnetization @xmath53 can be evaluated , since it represents the normalized histogram of @xmath54 taken over a sufficiently large number of columns in the stationary region @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the probability distribution @xmath55 of the order parameter of an equilibrium system at criticality is universal ( up to rescaling of the order parameter ) and thus it contains very useful and interesting information on the universality class of the system @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the thermal dependence of @xmath56 for a fixed lattice size ( @xmath57 ) as obtained for the mem . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath56 is a gaussian centered at @xmath58 but when the temperature gets lowered , the distribution broadens and develops two peaks at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "further decreasing the temperature causes these peaks to become dominant while the distribution turns distinctly non - gaussian , exhibiting a minimum just at @xmath58 .",
    "the emergence of the maxima at @xmath61 is quite abrupt .",
    "this behavior reminds us the order parameter probability distribution characteristic of the one dimensional ising model .",
    "in fact , for the well studied @xmath62dimensional ising model @xcite , we know that for @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a gaussian centered at @xmath65 , given by @xmath66 where the susceptibility @xmath67 is related to order parameter fluctuations by @xmath68    = 4.0in=3.0 in    = 4.0in=3.0 in    decreasing temperature the order parameter probability distribution broadens , it becomes non - gaussian , and near @xmath39 it splits into two peaks that get the more separated the lower the temperature . for @xmath69 and linear dimensions @xmath33 much larger than the correlation length @xmath70 of order parameter fluctuations ,",
    "one may approximate @xmath64 near the peaks by a double - gaussian distribution , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spontaneous magnetization , while the susceptibility @xmath67 is now given by @xmath73 from equation ( 4 ) it turns out that the gaussian squared width @xmath74 associated with high temperature distributions is very close to the 2nd moment of the order parameter , i.e. @xmath75 equation ( 8) is a consequence of the gaussian shape of the order parameter probability distribution and , thus , it holds for the mem as well . from the known one - dimensional exact solution for a chain of @xmath33",
    "spins @xcite one can obtain @xmath76 then , equations ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) lead us to @xmath77 ( where it has been taken into account that @xmath78 due to finite - size effects , irrespective of temperature ) . from equations ( 8) and ( 10 ) we can see that the high temperature gaussian probability distribution broadens exponentially as @xmath14 gets lowered , until it develops delta - like peaks at @xmath79 as a consequence of a boundary effect on the widely extended distribution . it should be noticed that for @xmath80 this phenomenon is prevented by the finite critical temperature which splits the gaussian , as implied by equation ( 6 ) .    turning back to the mem , figure 1",
    "strongly suggests that an analogous mechanism should be responsible for the thermal dependence exhibited by the mem s order parameter distribution function .",
    "so , by analogy to equation ( 9 ) , we assume the relation @xmath81 to hold for the mem , where we have introduced a phenomenological parameter @xmath82 , and the susceptibility @xmath67 is given by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "we find an excellent agreement to the data by choosing the value @xmath83 as observed in figure 2(a ) , where ln - linear plots of @xmath84 versus @xmath85 are shown for strip widths varying in the range @xmath86 .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows plots of @xmath87 versus @xmath14 for the same lattices .",
    "this figure shows that increasing @xmath33 the order parameter curves approach the one that corresponds to the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the heaviside function ) .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    = 4.0in=3.0 in    however , it should be pointed out that the results obtained for the @xmath90-mem and the @xmath91-dimensional ising model do not exactly coincide for finite lattices , as figure 3(a ) shows for the case of the magnetization . anyway , this fact should not alarm us , since it can be seen that differences in the results obtained for both models are a direct consequence of the finite - size nature of the lattices used in the simulations and consequently they tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is actually shown by figure 3(b ) , where log - linear plots of @xmath92 versus @xmath93 for two different fixed values of temperature are presented .",
    "thus , we conclude that in view of the full qualitative and quantitative agreement between both models we can safely establish that , as in the 1d ising model , the @xmath90-mem is not critical ( i.e. it also undergoes a phase transition at @xmath94 ) .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    we have also computed the number of already occupied nn sites every time that a new particle was added to the spin system , and thus we have obtained the normalized probability @xmath95 of having @xmath96 occupied nn sites .",
    "figure 4 shows the behavior of @xmath95 as a function of temperature . using this probability",
    "we have evaluated @xmath97 irrespective of the temperature .",
    "this result can be understood considering that the growing process that leads to the assignment of a spin @xmath19 to each lattice site of coordinates @xmath5 can be studied by means of a bond model .",
    "in fact , we can assign a bond to each pair of neighboring sites , pointing from the earlier occupied site to the later occupied one .",
    "so , the process that leads to a given spin configuration can be specified by the fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where sub - indexes @xmath100 and @xmath101 refer to the upper bond of @xmath5 ( i.e. , the bond that connects the site of coordinates @xmath5 with that of coordinates @xmath102 ) , and to the right bond of the site of coordinates @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath103 if the bond points outwards and @xmath104 if it is directed inwards . therefore",
    ", the net bond flux at a given lattice site @xmath5 is given by : @xmath105 and the possible values that @xmath106 can take are @xmath107 .",
    "after some algebra , it follows that @xmath108 holds for every site on the lattice .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that , for an arbitrary @xmath109-dimensional lattice of coordination number @xmath110 , @xmath111 . then , @xmath112 is the mean number of occupied nn , since @xmath113 .",
    "for the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath114 and equation ( 13 ) yields @xmath115 , in agreement with the result we have already obtained by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    further insights into the mem s growing process can be gained by studying the mean energy change involved in the addition of a new particle to the system . the process of adding a new spin involves an energy change @xmath16 and from the definition of the @xmath32mem , the possible values that @xmath16 can take are @xmath116 ( in units of @xmath6 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows plots of the normalized probability @xmath117 versus @xmath14 for each of these values .",
    "the non - equilibrium nature of the mem manifests itself through much more complex probability distributions @xmath117 ( see figure 5 ) than the corresponding to the equilibrium ising model where @xmath16 can take only five different values , namely @xmath118 ( in units of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the results shown in figures 4 and 5 confirm the non - trivial nature of the link established between the mem at stationarity and the ising model in equilibrium .",
    "it should be noticed that for the case of crystal growth models ( cgm ) @xcite the growing conditions are quite different than those of the mem .",
    "in fact , in cgm the crystal grows layer by layer in a given direction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the probability distribution of the predecessor spin layer is sampled from the * equilibrium * distribution , so will be the probability of spins in subsequent layers .",
    "this particular growth mechanism allow to establish dual transformations with the kinetic ising model @xcite and to extract some exact results .",
    "in contrast , the growing interface of the mem is self - affine and the system is far from equilibrium .",
    "so , the link between the 1d ising model and the @xmath22dimensional mem is quite challenging .",
    "= 4.0in=3.1 in    in order to compare the @xmath119dimensional mem and the 2d ising model , we have first studied the order parameter probability distribution @xmath120 , where @xmath121 takes now @xmath122 possible values ( see figure 6 ) . for high temperatures , the probability distribution corresponds to a gaussian centered at @xmath123 . at lower temperatures we observe the onset of two maxima located at @xmath124 @xmath125 , which become sharper and",
    "approach @xmath126 as @xmath14 is gradually decreased .    = 4.0in=3.0 in    figure 7 shows the location of the maximum of the probability distribution as a function of temperature for both @xmath127-dimensional mem models , with @xmath128 . while for the @xmath129 case we observe a smooth transition from the @xmath130 value characteristic of high temperatures to nonzero @xmath131 values that correspond to lower temperatures , the curve obtained for @xmath132 shows , in contrast , a heaviside - like jump . as already discussed , the behavior exhibited by the @xmath133-dimensional mem ( e.g. , as displayed by figures 6 and 7 ) is the signature of a thermal continuous phase transition that takes place at a finite critical temperature .",
    "the broken symmetry at a finite critical temperature @xmath39 implied by the thermal continuous phase transition can be explained in terms of the broken ergodicity that occurs in the system when we tend to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath134 ) making use of the temperature dependence exhibited by the order parameter distribution function .",
    "in fact , if we set the characteristic length of mem s domains @xmath37 equal to an ergodic length @xmath135 , we can carry out a complete analogy with the ising model by associating @xmath135 to @xmath47 ( the ising model ergodic time ) and the cluster s total length @xmath50 ( already defined in section 3 ) to the ising model observation time @xmath46 . in this way",
    ", we encounter that excursions of @xmath121 from @xmath136 to @xmath137 and _ vice versa _ occur at length scales of the order of @xmath135 . when the cluster s total length becomes larger and larger ( @xmath138 ) the whole cluster s magnetization is averaged to zero .",
    "furthermore , @xmath135 diverges as the strip s width becomes larger and larger , and again broken symmetry arises as the consequence of broken ergodicity .      as already anticipated and as it follows from figures 6 and 7 , the @xmath133-dimensional mem exhibits a thermally driven order - disorder transition at a finite temperature . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath134 ) we expect to determine a critical temperature @xmath39 such that @xmath139 for @xmath63 while @xmath140 remain non - vanishing at temperatures below @xmath39 .",
    "from the finite - size scaling theory , developed for the treatment of finite - size effects at criticality and under equilibrium conditions @xcite , it is well known that if a thermally driven phase transition occurs at a temperature @xmath141 in the thermodynamic limit , then in a confined geometry this transition becomes smeared out over the temperature region @xmath142 around a shifted effective transition temperature @xmath143 , and the following relationships hold : @xmath144 and @xmath145 where the rounding and shift exponents are given by @xmath146 , respectively ( recalling that @xmath147 is the exponent that characterizes the divergence of the correlation length at criticality ) .    furthermore , from well established finite - size scaling relations , the following anstze hold just at criticality @xmath148 : @xmath149 and @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the order parameter and the susceptibility critical exponents , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath153 , as given by equation ( 17 ) , refers to the maximum of @xmath154 as a function of @xmath14 for fixed lattice size @xmath33 .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    in view of the encountered analogies between the mem and the ising model , it is natural to test the validity of equations ( 14 - 17 ) for the case of the mem in @xmath21-dimensions .",
    "it should be noted that as in the case of equilibrium systems , in the present case various  effective \" l - dependent critical temperatures can also be defined . in particular",
    ", we will define @xmath155 as the value that corresponds to @xmath156 for fixed @xmath33 , and @xmath157 as the one corresponding to the maximum of the susceptibility for a given @xmath33 , assuming that the susceptibility is related to order parameter fluctuations in the same manner as for equilibrium systems ( as given by equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) ) .",
    "then , we should be able to obtain @xmath39 from plots of @xmath158 versus @xmath93 ( for @xmath159 ) , as it is shown in figure 8 . following this procedure we find that both @xmath155 and @xmath157 extrapolate ( approximately ) to the same value , allowing us to evaluate the critical temperature @xmath160 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "after determining @xmath39 , the correlation length exponent @xmath147 can be evaluated by means of equation ( 15 ) , making the replacement @xmath161 .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath162 at the mean , maximum and minimum values allowed by the error bars , we obtain six log - log plots of @xmath163 versus @xmath33 for @xmath159 .",
    "the slope of each of these plots , not shown here for the sake of space , yields a value for @xmath147 .",
    "the obtained values are : @xmath164 @xmath165 and @xmath166 @xmath167    thus our estimate is given by @xmath168 , where the error bars reflect the error derived from the evaluation of @xmath39 , as well as the statistical error .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    figure 9 shows plots of the susceptibility versus @xmath14 as obtained using lattices of different side .",
    "it is found that the susceptibility exhibits a peak which becomes sharper and shifts towards lower temperatures when @xmath33 is increased .",
    "this behavior is , in fact , already anticipated by equation ( 17 ) , and it allows us to evaluate @xmath169 from the slope of a log - log plot of @xmath170 versus @xmath33 , as figure 10 shows . the linear fit yields @xmath171 . using this value and the value formerly obtained for @xmath147 we thus determine @xmath172 .",
    "= 4.0in=3.0 in    = 4.0in=3.0 in    figure 11 shows log - log plots of @xmath173 versus @xmath33 for the mean , maximum and minimum allowed values of @xmath39 .",
    "considering only the larger lattices , the linear fits to the data according to equation ( 16 ) yield the following estimates : @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "we then assume the value @xmath177 , where the error bars reflect the error derived from the evaluation of @xmath39 , as well as the statistical error . from this value and the value formerly obtained for @xmath147",
    "we thus determine @xmath178 .",
    "the critical exponents of the mem in @xmath119dimensions as obtained using a finite - size scaling analysis are , so far : @xmath168 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "if we recall the exactly known critical exponents of the @xmath4 ising model , i.e. @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , we find that the @xmath30mem has the same critical exponents within error bars . these results",
    "further support our conjecture on the connection between the mem in @xmath21-dimensions and the ising model in @xmath184 dimensions .    as in the case of the mem in @xmath185 ,",
    "we have also computed the number of already occupied nn sites every time that a new particle was added to the spin system .",
    "we found that the value @xmath186 holds for all temperatures , which is indeed the result given by equation ( 13 ) , since @xmath187 for the three - dimensional square lattice .    at this stage , we may recall that for the @xmath32mem @xmath188 equals the coordination number of the @xmath132 ising model , and that we found that both models have the same critical temperature and exhibit the same critical behavior .",
    "reasoning by analogy , we may expect a coincidence between the critical temperature for the @xmath30mem and the corresponding one for a @xmath129 ising model defined on a lattice of coordination number @xmath189 . however , this comparison can not be carried out , since the critical temperature of an ising model depends on both the coordination number @xmath110 and the topological structure of the lattice , but for @xmath80 and a given value of @xmath110 the topological structure is not unique .",
    "for instance , for @xmath129 and @xmath189 , we can pass from the honeycomb lattice ( hl ) to the expanded kagom lattice ( ekl ) through the application of a star - triangle transformation and obtain the exact values of their critical points , which turn out to be @xcite @xmath190 ( hl ) and @xmath191 ( ekl ) .",
    "in the present work we have studied the growth of magnetic eden clusters with ferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbor spins in a @xmath0dimensional rectangular geometry ( for @xmath128 ) , using monte carlo simulations and applying a finite - size scaling theory .",
    "the results obtained allow us to conjecture a nontrivial correspondence between the mem for the irreversible growth of magnetic materials and the classical ising model under equilibrium conditions .",
    "in fact , we have found that the @xmath0dimensional mem and the @xmath62dimensional ising model behave identically ( unless finite - size differences that vanish in the thermodynamic limit ) at criticality , i.e. that both models belong to the same universality class .",
    "we also conjecture that this correspondence would remain at higher dimensions @xmath192 .",
    "the results obtained strongly suggest a link between the temporal evolution of equilibrium systems and the stationary growth of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we thus believe that this work will stimulate further developments in the field of nonequilibrium kinetic growth models . a more precise numerical test of the posed conjecture will certainly require a considerable computational effort but it will be of great interest .",
    "furthermore , analytical developments aimed to establish a theoretical framework for the understanding of far from equilibrium growth phenomena will become stimulated by the reported findings .",

    "<S> the orientation of the added spins depends on both the energetic interaction with already deposited spins and the temperature , through a boltzmann factor . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical monte carlo investigation of the mem has been performed and the results of the simulations have been analyzed using finite - size scaling arguments . as in the case of the ising model , the mem in @xmath2 is non - critical ( only exhibits an ordered phase at @xmath3 ) . in @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> the mem exhibits an order - disorder transition of second - order at a finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> such transition has been characterized in detail and the relevant critical exponents have been determined . </S>",
    "<S> these exponents are in agreement ( within error bars ) with those of the ising model in 2 dimensions . further similarities between both models have been found by evaluating the probability distribution of the order parameter , the magnetization and the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained by means of extensive computer simulations allow us to put forward a conjecture which establishes a nontrivial correspondence between the mem for the irreversible growth of spins and the equilibrium ising model . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is certainly a theoretical challenge and its confirmation will contribute to the development of a framework for the study of irreversible growth processes .    </S>",
