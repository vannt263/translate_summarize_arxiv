    "the existence of weak - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) , stabilizing the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the standard model ( sm ) , is a tantalizing hypothesis@xcite .",

    "hence , the search for supersymmetric particles is a high priority task for collider experiments .",
    "expectations for super - particle masses are typically in the 1001000  gev range , whereas current limits on them are generally below @xmath11@xcite , although the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron probe gluinos and squarks as heavy as 150200  gev@xcite . in the near future , lep  ii will probe slepton and chargino masses up to @xmath12 gev , while tevatron experiments , for favourable parameter ranges , may indirectly reach @xmath13 gev in the main injector era , via the clean tri - lepton signal from @xmath14 production@xcite .",
    "these experiments have a good chance to discover weak scale supersymmetry , but they can not exclude it",
    ". a thorough search for low - energy supersymmetry can only be made at the recently approved cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) or , alternatively , at @xmath15 linear colliders with center of mass energies exceeding 500 - 1000  gev@xcite .",
    "most early analyses were carried out within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , which is the supersymmetric extension of the sm with the least number of additional new particles and interactions necessary for phenomenology . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath16-parity is exactly conserved , so that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable",
    ". supersymmetry breaking is parametrized by the introduction of soft susy breaking mass terms and interactions consistent with the sm gauge group . since each @xmath17 multiplet of sfermions and gauginos",
    "has an independent mass , the most general parametrization of susy breaking requires a large number of mass parameters , and also many arbitrary trilinear scalar couplings .    without further assumptions about these parameters , any phenomenological analysis is essentially intractable .",
    "motivated by grand unified theories ( guts ) , we shall , following the early susy analyses in ref.@xcite , further assume that the three @xmath18 gaugino masses originate in a common gaugino mass at some high scale , so that the ratios of these masses at the weak scale are proportional to the corresponding ratios of the squared gauge couplings .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gaugino masses are then determined in terms of @xmath6 . motivated by supergravity models , these analyses further assumed a common _ physical _ mass for each of the light squarks , left and right sleptons , and sneutrinos .",
    "the higgs sector of this model is determined at tree level by @xmath21 , the mass of the neutral pseudoscalar , in addition to the parameters @xmath22 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values , and @xmath23 , the superpotential higgsino mass ( which also enter the gaugino - higgsino sector ) .",
    "finally , the weak - scale @xmath24-parameters , which mainly affect the phenomenology of third generation squarks were needed to completely specify the model . in what follows , and in the simulation program isajet@xcite",
    ", we use the term mssm to refer to this supergravity - inspired framework .    in view of the fact that the additional assumptions for the mssm are motivated by supergravity gut models",
    ", it seems reasonable to seriously explore their implications .",
    "the assumptions underlying these models , which differ in important ways from those of the mssm , are outlined below .",
    "several phenomenological analyses of supergravity models@xcite have recently appeared in the literature@xcite . in minimal supergravity with canonical kinetic energy terms ,",
    "gravitational interactions communicate the effects of supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector to the observable sector of particles . these gravitational interactions , being universal , lead to a common mass ( @xmath25 ) for all scalar fields and common trilinear and bilinear soft susy breaking ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) scalar interactions@xcite .",
    "the resulting lagrangian should be regarded as an effective lagrangian of the theory below the planck scale , with its parameters renormalized at some ultra - high energy scale close to @xmath28 .",
    "if we further assume that these interactions respect an ( unbroken ) gut symmetry , the gauginos must all be part of a single multiplet , and so must have a common mass ( @xmath29 ) at the this scale .",
    "similar considerations also apply to string models , which can lead to coupling constant unification without a grand unifying gauge group@xcite .",
    "the susy breaking sector of the model is then completely specified by these four parameters .    for phenomenological analyses ,",
    "the running parameters in the lagrangian should be renormalized at the weak scale to sum the large logarithms arising from the disparity between the high scale where the physics is simple , and the weak scale relevant to collider phenomenology .",
    "this is most conveniently done using renormalization group ( rg ) equations@xcite and taking the common values of the four high - scale input parameters as boundary conditions .",
    "the rg evolution splits the various masses and leads to a rich spectrum at the weak scale@xcite .",
    "the first two generations of squarks are approximately degenerate , so these models automatically satisfy constraints@xcite from the non - observation of flavour changing neutral currents in the kaon sector , while @xmath30 , the lighter @xmath31-squark and @xmath32 , the lighter @xmath33-squark , may be substantially lighter .",
    "sleptons are lighter than squarks , and may be much lighter if gluinos and squarks of the first two generations have comparable masses . as a bonus",
    ", the rg evolution also gives the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite for considerable ranges of input parameters .",
    "it is customary to eliminate @xmath27 in favour of @xmath22 and to adjust the value of @xmath23 to reproduce the measured @xmath34 boson mass .",
    "then the particle / sparticle masses and couplings are determined by the following parameters ( along with @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 in particular , the values of the mssm parameters @xmath23 and @xmath21 are determined .",
    "typically , @xmath23 is large , so that the lighter charginos and neutralinos are dominately gaugino - like , while the heavier ones are dominantly higgsino - like .",
    "also , @xmath37 so the lightest higgs scalar ( @xmath38 ) resembles a sm higgs boson with the other higgs particles all relatively heavy . in what follows",
    ", we shall use the term sugra to mean supersymmetry with masses and mixings calculated from the parameters in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the simulation program isajet@xcite now allows the user either to specify the weak - scale mssm parameters  the gluino , squark , stop , sbottom and slepton masses , @xmath24-parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath22  or to use values of these parameters calculated from the sugra parameter set ( 1 ) . because the sugra model is specified by just four new parameters , various experimental observables that can be determined in experiments at colliders",
    "become correlated and so provide non - trivial tests of the underlying assumptions@xcite .",
    "it is , however , worth remembering that sugra models are based on extrapolations of physics which may ultimately prove incorrect . while these models are indeed very attractive , economical , and satisfy all phenomenological constraints , it may be worthwhile to test the sensitivity of model predictions by running isajet using the optional mssm input set , which is a more general framework that can encompass models with non - universal soft - breaking sfermion mass terms",
    ". this may be particularly important for assessing the reach of future facilities .",
    "since strongly interacting sparticles are most copiously produced at hadron colliders , many of the early studies of supersymmetry at hadron supercolliders focussed on the detection of gluinos and squarks@xcite .",

    "the fact that strongly - produced sparticle pairs are the dominant production mechanism for squarks and gluinos as heavy as 12  tev leads us to focus on signals from squarks and gluinos .",
    "once gluinos and squarks are produced , they are expected to decay through various channels until the cascade terminates in the stable lsp ( taken to be @xmath54)@xcite .",

    "we further scrutinize the missing energy plus multi - jet signal .",
    "our goals are multiple :    1 .",
    "we update previous results@xcite on multijet @xmath59 cross sections by using the latest isajet 7.13 simulation for sparticle production and cascade decays .",
    "2 .   we evaluate the reach of the lhc via some set of optimized cuts , valid across a large range of sparticle mass choices .",
    "we present our reach results in the parameter space of the minimal supergravity model with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the rather small parameter set yields a correlated spectrum of susy particle masses , and allows one to compare the regions of parameter space that different search experiments can probe .",
    "4 .   we examine what information can be gleaned from a sample of signal events in the missing energy plus multi - jet channel . for instance , can one tell whether the signal is mainly due to gluino production , or whether @xmath47 and @xmath60 production is also significant ?",
    "can one gain some sort of mass measurement for the gluino or squark ?",
    "can one identify the presence of other particles or sparticles by sifting through the debris of the cascade decay ?",
    "the first three of these points are addressed in sec .",
    "ii of this paper , where we mainly map out regions of sugra parameter space explorable by lhc experiments using the multi - jet plus missing energy signature .",
    "we also compare these regions with those where various slepton and chargino / neutralino searches are expected to result in observable signals . in sec .",
    "iii , we address the questions raised above in item  ( 4 ) , and find that to some degree , and at least in some cases , all the questions raised can be answered in the affirmative .",
    "we summarize our results and present our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "in this paper , we work within the framework of the minimal sugra model , as implemented in the isajet 7.13 subprogram isasugra@xcite . the sugra parameter set ( 1 )",
    "can be directly entered into isajet , and isasugra then calculates all the susy particle masses and mixings .",
    "briefly , starting with the precisely measured gauge couplings at scale @xmath61 , isasugra evolves the three mssm gauge couplings and third generation yukawa couplings to a mass scale ( determined to be @xmath62 gev ) where @xmath63 and @xmath64 unify . at this approximate unification scale , @xmath65 is set equal to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the gut scale boundary condition values for @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are implemented . from the approximate unification scale , the various soft susy breaking masses , gauge and yukawa couplings are evolved via 26 rge s to their weak scale values .",
    "we use 2-loop rge s for gauge couplings , but only 1-loop rge s for soft breaking terms .",
    "weak scale sparticle threshold effects are included within the gauge coupling evolution .",
    "soft breaking masses are evolved only down to the scale value equal to their mass value . at the electroweak scale , the 1-loop effective potential is minimized , allowing the replacement of @xmath66 by @xmath22 , and evaluating the magnitude ( but not the sign ) of @xmath23 in terms of @xmath61 .",
    "this procedure is iterated until a stable solution for all sparticle masses is obtained , consistent with grand unification and electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "after calculation of the spectra and couplings as detailed above , isasugra then calculates all available sparticle decay modes and branching fractions .",
    "currently , the program is valid only for @xmath67 ; for very large values of @xmath22 , the effects from sbottom and stau mixing , not yet included , become important .",
    "it also assumes that the lsp is @xmath54 , which is not true for all choices of the parameters in set  ( 1 ) .",
    "next , isajet generates all lowest order @xmath68 subprocesses for sparticle pair production according to their cross sections .",
    "the produced sparticles are then allowed to decay via the various possible cascades .",

    "major physics backgrounds come from various sm processes which can give large amounts of missing transverse energy due to neutrinos produced in events , due to mis - measurement by calorimeter cells , and due to dead regions of the detector .",
    "we evaluate to following sm background processes :    * qcd multi - jet production ( _ e.g. _ @xmath83 _ etc .",
    "_ , where extra jet activity comes from parton showers , ( this includes heavy flavor @xmath84 and @xmath85 production ) , * @xmath86multi - jet production , where @xmath87 or @xmath88 , * @xmath89multi - jet production , where @xmath90 or @xmath91 , * @xmath92 production and decay .",
    "we impose a series of cuts to extract signal from the vastly larger sm production cross sections .",
    "since we wish to detect gluinos or squarks over a large mass range @xmath93@xmath94  gev , different cuts are needed to optimize signal / background depending on the sparticle mass . after exploring a large variety of possible cuts for various sugra parameter choices , we arrived at the following requirements :    * no isolated leptons , * transverse sphericity @xmath95 to reduce qcd dijet background , * number of jets @xmath96 ( jets as defined above ) , * transverse plane angle @xmath97 between @xmath98 and closest jet is @xmath99 .",

    "the background is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "ii_c _ below .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that for @xmath108 gev , case 1 and 2 with @xmath109 gev are easily visible at levels of @xmath110@xmath111 above background , while the cases with heavier gluino masses are well below background . as the cut @xmath100",
    "is increased , the sm background decreases much more quickly than the heavy gluino signals . for @xmath112@xmath113  gev , the cases with @xmath114 gev begin exceeding background .",
    "to see the signal from @xmath2 gev above background , a hard cut of @xmath115@xmath116  gev is needed .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where two sets of cuts ( soft and hard ) were advocated to see light or heavy gluinos .",
    "as we will see shortly , gluino and squark mass values across the range of @xmath109 up to @xmath2@xmath94  gev ought to be detectable .",
    "in particular , there should be no `` undetectability window '' in @xmath6 between fermilab tevatron experiments of the main injector era , and lhc experiments    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also suggests a way to get a crude estimate of the gluino or squark mass .",
    "one plots the observed cross section versus @xmath100 ( for gradual stiffening of cuts ) , and compares with background expectations .",
    "the approximate range where @xmath6 might lie can be obtained by measuring event rates for several values of @xmath100 , starting at the point where observation begins exceeding expectations from sm processes , and comparing against monte carlo expectation of the signal .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have fixed @xmath117 and @xmath50 .",
    "variations in @xmath26 mainly affect third generation squark and slepton masses , so our results are relatively insensitive to different @xmath26 values as long as the light stop @xmath30 is not driven to too small a value . as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3]_a _ the cross section after cuts ( taking @xmath118 gev ) for @xmath119 gev ( case 3 ) and also for @xmath120 gev , for five choices of @xmath26 .",
    "little variation is seen when @xmath26 varies over the range shown .",
    "multi - jet@xmath59 signals are also relatively insensitive to variations in @xmath22 . case  3 is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]_b _ for five choices of @xmath22 and again shows only small differences in signal cross section .",
    "our next goal is to evaluate the reach of the lhc via the @xmath121 signature in sugra parameter space . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is clear that for very heavy gluinos , a large value of @xmath100 is desirable to enhance the signal relative to the background .",
    "for the heaviest gluinos and squarks observable at the lhc , which are roughly the heaviest consistent with susy relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking , we want to make a cut at about @xmath122  gev .",
    "only a very small fraction of the sm cross section passes such a cut , so it is necessary to combine events generated in several ranges of hard scattering @xmath107 ( @xmath123 ) for each sm process that can produce backgrounds .",
    "table  ii lists the ranges generated for each process , the total number of events for each range , and the number of monte carlo events and the corresponding cross section passing the cut @xmath124 .",
    "[ figbkg ] shows the background cross sections for each process and range of @xmath123 vs.  @xmath100 for those values of @xmath100 for which it is non - zero for the available statistics .",
    "while in retrospect a more uniform distribution of monte carlo events in @xmath125 would have given a better estimate of the background , the samples listed in table  ii are sufficient to provide an estimate of the sm background for all relevant values of @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath100 there are enough events in some range for each process to give an estimated background cross section greater than that from lower @xmath107 ranges that produce no events .",
    "therefore , we estimate the sm background as a function of @xmath100 using the 95% upper limit calculated from the ranges giving a nonzero number of events , setting the background from the ranges giving zero events to zero .",
    "in particular , the total background from table  ii then comes out to @xmath126 @xmath127 , which gives a 95% cl upper bound on the total bg to be @xmath128 .",
    "we conservatively use this value to obtain our @xmath129 reach .",
    "since isajet generates higher order qcd processes using the branching approximation , it does not necessarily give the correct background for susy signatures , which typically involve `` round '' events with jets far from the collinear limit in which the branching approximation is correct .",
    "fortunately , we find that our estimates of the sm background is smaller than the susy signal , so the susy mass reach is not very sensitive to the background estimate .",
    "also , the significance of any signal is not dependent on the calculation of the sm backgrounds , since these can be determined from other data .",
    "backgrounds from neutrinos from @xmath33 and @xmath130 decays can be checked against the @xmath107 distribution of non - isolated muons .",

    "we focus on several examples of intrinsic event properties , and the information they provide .",
    "if @xmath6 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath168 , then gluino pair production dominates , and each gluino decays typically via a lengthy cascade resulting in numerous final state jets , _",

    "the @xmath189 distribution has a wide range of smearing .",

    "although we have illustrated this only for a few cases , we expect this to be a generic feature .",
    "the multiplicity in gluino events can only be reduced if the branching fraction for the radiative decay @xmath191 becomes very large .",
    "we have also examined several other techniques for detecting the presence of squarks in the @xmath0 sample .",
    "these are based on the expectation that heavy squark events ( which form only a small fraction of the total sample ) are expected to be more spherical and have larger jet multiplicities .",
    "for the first two cases in table  i , we have examined ( _ i _ ) the transverse sphericity distribution , ( _ ii _ ) the scatter plot of the transverse sphericity ( @xmath136 ) versus the `` bigness '' @xmath192 , ( _ iii _ ) scatter plot of @xmath66 versus @xmath193 , the largest transverse momentum relative to the sphericity axis and ( _ iv _ ) the scatter plot of @xmath66 versus @xmath189 .",
    "only the last of these distributions appear to show any significant difference .",
    "because this last distribution is correlated with the jet multiplicity distributions that we have already studied , we do not show it here .",

    "@xcite , it was claimed that @xmath6 could be measured to @xmath199 by focussing on same - sign isolated dilepton events from @xmath45 production , where each gluino decays via @xmath200 , with @xmath201 .",
    "however , these calculations may be overly optimistic , since this study considered only a single production mechanism ( @xmath45 production whereas same sign dileptons can come from various susy sources ) , a single cascade decay chain , and neglected effects of additional qcd radiation .    here",
    ", we seek to measure the gluino mass in multi - jet@xmath59 events , following a similar path to ref .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we have a rough estimate of @xmath6 and @xmath168 by examining signal to background levels versus cut parameter @xmath100 . after obtaining a relatively clean sample of signal events for an appropriate @xmath100 value",
    ", we divide the event into two halves , using eigenvectors from constructing the transverse sphericity @xmath136 .",
    "we then construct the invariant mass of jets in each of the two hemispheres , using only jets with @xmath202 .",
    "events are rejected if there is only one qualifying jet in each hemisphere .",
    "we then plot as @xmath203 the maximal value of the mass of each hemisphere .",
    "results are shown in fig .",

    "background level is shown by the shaded regions . in these plots , as usual , all supersymmetric subprocesses are contributing , with full cascade decays and qcd radiation effects , and detector smearing as given in sec .  ii_a_.    we see in fig .",
    "[ fig9]_a _ , using @xmath108 gev for @xmath109 gev , that the @xmath203 distribution does indeed have a large smear due to the various effects listed previously .",
    "however , at least with our toy detector simulation , the two values of @xmath6 , which differ by @xmath204 , appear distinguishable .",
    "we plot values of @xmath203 for @xmath114 gev and @xmath205  gev in fig .",
    "[ fig9]_b _ , and plot for @xmath206 gev with @xmath207 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig9]_c_. again , values of @xmath6 differing by @xmath204 appear distinguishable .",
    "we note , however , that using a too small value of @xmath100 , or too small a value of @xmath208 , can lead to a large amounts of smearing in these distributions , and loss of distinguishability .",
    "these distributions appear workable only for rather narrow ranges of cuts that guarantee sufficient hemispheric separation of event debris , and that only the hardest debris is used in constructing @xmath203 , so that contamination of @xmath203 is avoided . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we show the same @xmath203 plot , but now for @xmath138 , so that @xmath3 ( we show only the first two cases in fig .  [ fig9 ] since the last case is not observable above background ) .",

    "multi - jet @xmath59 events from gluino and squark cascade decays are expected to be unusually rich in heavy flavor content ( mainly @xmath66 mesons , and @xmath31-quarks , if kinematically allowed ) compared to sm processes@xcite .",
    "this is due to a number of effects .    *",
    "the @xmath209 and @xmath210 masses are driven to values lower than the other squarks .",
    "this means decays like @xmath211 or @xmath212 can be kinematically allowed , and dominate decay rates for large enough values of @xmath6 .",
    "even if such decay modes are not allowed , three - body @xmath213 decays to @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 are enhanced relative to decays to other squarks due to the larger propagator factor for the lighter top and bottom squarks .",

    "iii_a _ , the average jet multiplicity is smaller for @xmath25 small , and larger for @xmath25 large .",
    "can one see direct evidence for higgs production in cascade decay events ?",
    "the light higgs @xmath38 is usually produced somewhere down the cascade decay chain via @xmath227 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that only in very limited regions of parameter space is the decay @xmath228 likely to be visible .",
    "we have investigated cases 19 of table  ii to see whether the @xmath229 decay can also be observed in cascade decay events .",
    "we do this by constructing the invariant mass @xmath230 of all tagged @xmath66-jet pairs .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "first we show case 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig11]_a _ , where @xmath223 gev , and @xmath231 dominantly decays to real sleptons and sneutrinos , so that higgs production in susy events is minimal . in this case , a higgs peak is not necessarily expected ; we see a continuum distribution with only a slight bump at @xmath232 . in fig .",
    "[ fig11]_b _ ( case 3 ) , where both gluino and squark pair production is important , @xmath157 occurs at 94% branching ratio , the higgs bump at @xmath233 gev stands out against the continuum from other tagged @xmath66-jet pairs in the susy events .",
    "this is despite the fact that decays to @xmath33 and @xmath31 squarks constitute 60% of the gluino decays .",
    "higgs production from the cascade decays of the first two generations of squarks remains observable . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig11]_c _ , we show the distribution for case 8 , where @xmath157 occurs with 98% branching ratio .",
    "however , in this case there are very many other sources of tagged @xmath66-jets from @xmath213 cascade decays , especially @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath45 production is by far the dominant process , there is a very high @xmath66 multiplicity ; then , the higgs boson is frequently produced along with other @xmath66-jets , so that the combinatorial background tends to wash out the higgs bump .",
    "the higgs signal was also detectable at the appropriate higgs mass in case 4 ; the signal did not stand out for the other four cases in table  iii .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears that while the @xmath66-multiplicity is frequently enhanced above sm expectations , the @xmath229 signal can be identified only in limited regions of the parameter space : obviously , we need a substantial number of tagged @xmath66-jets from higgs decay , but also that these events should not ( as , for instance , in case 3 ) simultaneously contain other tagged @xmath66-jets which would then produce a large combinatorial background .",
    "another requirement for the detection of the higgs boson bump is that the rate from other sources of tagged @xmath66-jets ( _ e.g. _ @xmath237 and @xmath238 decays , where the squarks may be real or virtual ) should not be overwhelmingly large .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a detailed analysis of the multi - jet@xmath59 signal expected from production and decay of supersymmetric particles within the framework of the minimal supergravity model , in which sparticle masses and couplings are fixed in terms of the parameter set ( 1 ) .",
    "assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath1 , we have shown that the @xmath0 signal ( mainly from gluino and squark production and decay ) should be observable in experiments at the lhc for gluino masses ranging from values accessible to fermilab tevatron experiments , up to nearly @xmath56 gev ( @xmath4 gev ) for @xmath3 ( for @xmath58 ) , confirming earlier studies by the atlas collaboration@xcite .",
    "we expect that the reach ( in terms of sparticle masses ) is not very sensitive to the details of the model as long as r - parity is conserved . comparing the lhc reach in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath168 with somewhat subjective upper bounds from fine tuning constraints@xcite ( recall that the resolution of the fine - tuning problem provided the original motivation for phenomenological susy )",
    ", it seems likely that lhc can perform a thorough search for @xmath16-conserving weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "we show the susy reach via the multi - jets@xmath59 channel in the @xmath239 plane of the minimal sugra model with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in fig .",
    "[ fig5][fig7 ] .",
    "the relatively small parameter set yields a complete , highly correlated sparticle spectrum , so that the plot of the reach in the @xmath0 channel can be compared with previous studies on the reach for sleptons and charginos / neutralinos . by comparing these various regions in figs .",
    "[ fig5][fig7 ] , we see that of the channels studied , the reach in multi - jets@xmath59 is by far the largest .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that multilepton signals ( _ e.g. _ same - sign dileptons and trileptons ) from cascade decays of gluinos and squarks may also probe some or all of this region .",
    "these signals would be especially important if @xmath25 is very small , or if gluino decays to third generations fermions and sfermions are strongly enhanced .",
    "these multilepton signals could then provide a striking confirmation of a supersymmetric signal discovery in the multi - jet@xmath59 channel .",
    "we have also studied what further information about sparticle properties can be obtained by a careful study of the @xmath0 sample .",
    "we have used isajet to demonstrate that jet multiplicity can be a useful tool for detecting the presence of squarks in the @xmath0 sample , and indirectly inferring the squark to gluino mass ratio . of course , the distribution of jet multiplicity is sensitive to the sparticle mass , so that this method is useful only after an estimate of the mass is obtained .",
    "we have further demonstrated that it might be possible to obtain a measure of the gluino mass by dividing each event in two halves , and using the greater of the masses in the two hemispheres as an estimator of @xmath6 .",
    "we see from the distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] that gluino masses differing by 1525% might be possible to distinguish .",
    "since we have included the production of all sparticles in our simulation as well as contamination to the hemispheres from qcd jets , we believe that it would be worth testing this technique to see if it survives a detailed detector simulation .",
    "finally , we have studied if signals from higgs bosons produced by cascade decays of gluinos and squarks and decaying via @xmath229 are detectable .",
    "we conclude that , with reasonable @xmath66 tagging efficiencies , this is possible but only for favourable ranges of parameters , where events containing higgs bosons are relatively free of other @xmath66-jets , and further , that @xmath66-jets from other susy sources do not overwhelm the higgs signal .",
    "it should nonetheless be kept in mind that susy events frequently tend to be rich in central @xmath66-jets , so that this may provide another handle for distinguishing susy from the sm , and gaining information on the squark to gluino mass ratio .      for a review of the minimal model and susy phenomenology ,",

    "<S> we use isajet to perform a detailed study of the missing transverse energy @xmath0 plus multi - jet signal expected from superparticle production at the cern lhc . </S>",

    "<S> we further examine what information can be gleaned from scrutinizing this event sample . for instance , the multi - jet multiplicity yields information on whether squark production makes a significant contribution to the observed @xmath0 sample . </S>",

    "<S> finally , for favourable ranges of parameters , by reconstructing masses of tagged @xmath8 jet pairs , it may be possible to detect higgs bosons produced via sparticle cascade decay chains . </S>"
