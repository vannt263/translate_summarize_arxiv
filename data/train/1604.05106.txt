    "a standard phenomenon in geometric optics is refraction of light across the boundary of two media with indices of refraction @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ fig:1](a ) ) .",
    "the well - known snell s law states that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the incidence angle ( the angle between the incident light ray and the normal to the boundary ) and @xmath5 is the refraction angle ( the angle between the refracted light ray and the normal to the boundary ) .",
    "in fact this is also true when the boundary is a curved surface rather than a plane.@xcite    a more complicated situation is when the refraction index varies continuously  rather than sharply as above  across space , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "the main difference is the existence of a continuous gradient of index of refraction within the medium .",
    "a host of interesting phenomena take place under this general situation .",
    "mirage is perhaps the most commonly known such phenomenon , in which temperature gradients above the hot ground induce variations in the index of refraction of air .",
    "this in turn leads to a curved path of light that gives the observer the impression of the existence of a second virtual image.@xcite besides mirage , a wide range of applications is termed under gradient - index optics , where as the name suggests , variations in the index of refraction within a material are used for certain applications .",
    "for example , in the core of a graded - index fiber the index of refraction decreases radially away from the axis .",
    "this prevents rays from diverging away from the axis and hence reduces dispersion .",
    "another example is graded - index lenses .",
    "unlike conventional spherical lenses , a graded - index lens has a flat surface , but features a variable index of refraction in such a way that the desired focusing of light is achieved .",
    "snell s law , eq .",
    ", tells us that whenever light crosses the interface between two media with different indices of refraction , the quantity @xmath0 is unchanged before and after refraction .",
    "this reminds us of a conservation law . of course",
    ", snell s law states this only for an abrupt change of the index of refraction as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "one is then naturally inclined to ask if the same or a similar conservation law holds in the general situation of variable index of refraction . in other words , we would like to ask if there is any quantity that is conserved on the light path in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .    to answer this question",
    ", we may use the intuition from the previous situation to guess a path for the trajectory of light in the general case .",
    "we can look at any point @xmath6 on the trajectory of light in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) and apply snell s law for the infinitesimal region surrounding it . now the gradient @xmath7 plays the role of the normal to the boundary separating the two regions with infinitesimally different values of @xmath8 .",
    "so the expectation will be that the quantity @xmath9 is conserved along the path if we interpret @xmath10 as the local refraction index at point @xmath6 , and @xmath11 as the angle between the path and @xmath12 .",
    "note that we have not found an explicit equation for the path .",
    "all we have done is to guess a candidate conserved quantity along the path , based on the simple form of snell s law . in the next section",
    "we find an explicit equation for the path and check whether @xmath9 is indeed conserved along the path .",
    "we use fermat s principle to obtain the path of light in a medium with variable index of refraction @xmath10 .",
    "fermat s principle states that the path of light between two given points is the one which minimizes the travel time .",
    "if the speed of light is constant in the medium containing the two points , the obvious conclusion is that light will travel on the straight line that joins the two points .",
    "a more complex situation is where the medium is comprised of two parts with constant but different speeds of light .",
    "one can then show from fermat s principle , using basic algebra , that the light path will be straight in each medium with a sharp edge at the boundary and the angle between the two paths obeys snell s law . if , however , the properties of the medium are such that the speed of light varies from point to point , then a more elaborate variational calculation is required as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath13 is a path that joins points @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we can parameterize @xmath13 , i.e. , write @xmath16 so that the function @xmath17 spans @xmath13 as the parameter @xmath18 varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "our aim is to find an equation for @xmath17 by requiring that the total travel time of light be minimized .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , ahead of any computation , that although we expect the light path @xmath13 to be unique , the function @xmath17 is not unique . as a simple example , both functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent a line parallel to the constant vector @xmath21 and hence describe the same path @xmath13 .    for a linear isotropic medium the speed of light at a point is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath10 is the refraction index at that point . noting that infinitesimal length element along @xmath13 is just the magnitude of @xmath24 , we can write the total travel time as @xmath25 where dot denotes @xmath26 . fermat s",
    "principle prescribes that the actual path @xmath13 that is followed by light minimizes this integral .",
    "now this is a standard variational problem , so we can use the toolkit of calculus of variations to find the light path.@xcite we have chosen a simple parameterization of @xmath13 to make it an easy variational problem .",
    "but it is instructive to work with other parameterizations that require a more careful treatment .",
    "the interested reader is encouraged to read appendix [ app ] for details , and refs .   for a more advanced treatment .",
    "for the present case , we note that the integral in eq .   is a special case of eq .   of appendix [ app ] , and thus according to the rules of calculus of variations",
    ", @xmath17 must satisfy the euler - lagrange equation , which now reads @xmath27",
    "= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i } \\left [ n({{\\mathbf{x}}}(s ) ) \\sqrt{\\dot{{\\mathbf{x}}}(s ) \\cdot \\dot{{\\mathbf{x}}}(s ) } \\right ] , \\qquad i=1,2,3.\\ ] ] performing @xmath28 and @xmath29 derivatives , we obtain the result @xmath30 where we have defined @xmath31 ( as usual , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the magnitude and direction of @xmath21 ) and all function arguments are suppressed .",
    "the gradient on @xmath8 appears because of differentiation with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "if we also carry out @xmath26 we need to take into account the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath8 through its @xmath6-dependence : @xmath35 .",
    "so we may write eq .",
    "equivalently as @xmath36    equations   and are our equations for the path of light @xmath17 .",
    "it is indeed hard to solve any of these equations , since for generic @xmath10 they are non - linear ( both in @xmath6 and @xmath37 ) second order differential equations .",
    "even the planar trajectories when the incident ray is initially tangent or normal to the surfaces of constant @xmath8 are not trivial . also note that if @xmath17 is any solution to then @xmath38 is also a solution , for any monotonic function @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this reflects the non - uniqueness we mentioned above .",
    "now that we have the equation for the path at our disposal , we turn to the question of conservation of @xmath0 .",
    "we first note that @xmath42 is the angle between the path and @xmath7 . thus defining the unit vector @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 we can now compute @xmath45 \\\\ & = 2 ( { { \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}}}\\times n{{\\hat{\\mathbf{v } } } } ) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d{{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}}}}{ds }",
    "\\times n{{\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}}}+ { { \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}}}\\times \\frac{d}{ds } ( n{{\\hat{\\mathbf{v } } } } ) \\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now @xmath46 vanishes by means of eq .  .",
    "then we can use @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) to obtain @xmath51 \\cdot n{{\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}}}.\\ ] ] if we apply @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 , @xmath49 , and @xmath54 ) to the quantity inside the brackets , we get @xmath55 \\cdot n{{\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}}}\\\\ & = -2n^2 ( { { \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}}}\\cdot { { \\hat{\\mathbf{v } } } } ) \\left(\\frac{d{{\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}}}}{ds } \\cdot { { \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}}}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath56 , since @xmath57 is a unit vector and @xmath58 .",
    "this is in marked contrast with our expectation that @xmath0 should be conserved . to better appreciate the difference ,",
    "let us simplify this result when everything happens in a plane , i.e. , @xmath57 , @xmath33 and @xmath59 are coplanar .",
    "let @xmath42 measure the angle from @xmath57 to @xmath33 in the counterclockwise direction ( so for example , @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) . then , since @xmath61 , the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath33 is @xmath62 , where the @xmath63 sign applies when @xmath59 is obtained by a @xmath64-degree clockwise rotation of @xmath57",
    ".   becomes @xmath65 or @xmath66 we see that @xmath0 is not conserved , unless @xmath7 is a unidirectional vector field or the incident light is tangent to the surface of constant @xmath8 .",
    "we need to understand what was wrong in our original expectation .",
    "we now try to revisit the nave argument that led to the conservation of @xmath0 and justify its nonconservations using simple arguments based on snell s law .    the key point in resolving",
    "the problem is to accurately depict the regions of constant @xmath8 in the neighborhood of the point of interest .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where a planar trajectory of light is shown passing from a region with index of refraction @xmath1 to an infinitesimally nearby one with @xmath2 .",
    "the surfaces of constant @xmath8 , and hence the gradients @xmath7 , are not parallel .",
    "this means that the intermediate region with index of refraction @xmath67 has non - parallel boundaries which make an infinitesimal angle @xmath68 .",
    "the incident ( refraction ) angle is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) as measured from the normal to the left ( right ) boundary of the @xmath69 region .",
    "we want to compare @xmath70 with @xmath71 .    .",
    "the infinitesimal intermediate region with index @xmath69 is magnified . ]",
    "we need to related @xmath5 to @xmath4 through the intermediate angles @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ". we can write snell s law for the left and right boundary , respectively : @xmath74 the main point is that @xmath75 ; if they were equal , we would readily obtain @xmath76 from the above equation . instead , from the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we have @xmath77 .",
    "we can now taylor expand @xmath78 to the leading order in @xmath68 to obtain @xmath79 this is precisely the same as the analytic result , once we note that @xmath80 and the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] corresponds to the @xmath81 sign of eq .  .",
    "we observe that the falsehood of our original expectation about the conservation of @xmath0 is related to ignoring the tilt of the gradient vector @xmath7 .",
    "once this is carefully taken into account , there is no discrepancy .",
    "we showed that our nave guess about the conservation of @xmath0 is incorrect .",
    "the next natural question to ask is `` what is conserved then ? '' a similar question can be asked in classical mechanics of particles . in that case , the conservation laws are known to be consequences of symmetries .",
    "so it pays if we view our problem as the motion of a particle in a potential . to this end , it is easiest to work with a length parameterization where @xmath82 is the length of the curve and @xmath83 .",
    "it then follows that eq .",
    "becomes @xmath84 ( compare with eq .   of appendix  [ app : length ] ) .",
    "this can now be compared with the equation @xmath85 for the trajectory of a particle under the influence of the potential @xmath86 .    we know from classical mechanics that if @xmath86 has a symmetry , then there exists a quantity that is conserved in time @xmath87 .",
    "so we conclude in analogy that if @xmath10 has a symmetry , then there exists a quantity that is conserved in @xmath88 , that is , along the path . as an example , if @xmath86 has translational symmetry along some given direction ( e.g. , is independent of the horizontal distance @xmath89 ) , we know that the conserved quantity is the component of momentum @xmath90 along that direction ( e.g. , @xmath91 ) .",
    "we can thus draw the conclusion that when @xmath10 has translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to @xmath7 ( i.e. , the surfaces of constant @xmath8 are parallel flat planes ) , then the conserved quantity is the component of @xmath92 along @xmath7 .",
    "this is precisely the statement of conservation of @xmath0 .",
    "this analogy tells us that the conservation of @xmath0 is related to the symmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "but it also tells us that when @xmath10 has no symmetry , we should not expect anything to be conserved .",
    "at this point it is worthwhile to mention a caveat in our analysis when it comes to real world applications .",
    "as indicated in footnote  , in this paper we are solely concerned with geometrical optics , where the wavelengths of rays are much smaller than the scales of the problem .",
    "so we have ignored the phase of the wave altogether . however , there are situations in which an abrupt phase change takes place somewhere along the path that can dramatically affect the analysis , even though the wavelengths are still negligible .",
    "this is because the actual form of fermat s law ( also called generalized fermat s law ) is about extremizng the _ phase change _ of light , rather than its _",
    "travel time_. when there is no change of phase due to external agents , the only way the phase @xmath93 changes between two points is through @xmath94 ; so extremizing the phase amounts to extremizing the time .",
    "but in general we have to take into account the effect of other forms of phase change if they are present .",
    "we are not going to discuss the generalized fermat s law any further here , except to quote the generalized form of the refraction law for the case where the abrupt phase change is imparted to the wave in passing through a flat interface like fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the wavelength of the light in vacuum , and @xmath97 is the vertical direction along the interface .",
    "we see that the effect of a gradient of @xmath93 is to violate the conservation of @xmath0 even in the flat interface case . for detailed derivation and application ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "we began with a heuristic but nave argument that led to the conclusion that @xmath0 must be conserved along light path in a medium with variable speed of light .",
    "we then analyzed the problem using fermat s principle and calculus of variations .",
    "( several other tricky versions of the variational problem were discussed in appendix  [ app ] .",
    "they deal with the subtleties of a variable domain of integration and inclusion of constraints . )",
    "comparison with the analytic result revealed that our original expectation was wrong .",
    "we finally returned to our heuristic argument and identified the problem .",
    "we calculated the amount of nonconservation of @xmath0 and found exactly the same answer as the one we obtained from the variational approach .",
    "in this appendix we find the equation for the path of light using different parameterizations that make the variational problem harder .",
    "it is only of pedagogical value , since we already know that eqs .   and are the answer .",
    "indeed it turns to be a valuable exercise in variational techniques and so we present the analysis in this appendix .",
    "let us briefly review the basics results of the variational method .",
    "the computational framework is easy to follow once a functional ( function of a function ) @xmath98 = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } l(x(t ) , \\dot x(t ) ) dt\\ ] ] is identified , which is supposed to be extremized ( stationary ) under variations of the function @xmath89 .",
    "the main result of calculus of variations is that @xmath99 is stationary if the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath100 is satisfied .",
    "when there are several functions @xmath89 , we have one such equation for each @xmath89 .",
    "we often refer to @xmath99 as `` functional '' or `` action '' , and to @xmath101 as `` integrand '' or `` lagrangian '' .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are also called `` equations of motion '' .",
    "this much of the formalism is sufficient for most applications .",
    "indeed this was all we used in section [ sec : light - path ] .",
    "but in what follows we will be dealing with situations with constraints . in such problems @xmath99",
    "is supposed to be extremized subject to a constraint @xmath102=0 $ ] , which is itself a functional of @xmath89 .",
    "then one forms the new functional @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a constant known as the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations suitable for the constrained problem are then exactly as eq .  , except that @xmath99 is changed to @xmath105 .",
    "finally , when the constraint is of algebraic form  like @xmath106 for all @xmath87then @xmath107 is an infinite set of lagrange multipliers ",
    "one for each @xmath87and the new functional @xmath108 is the object to satisfy eq .. @xcite all of these straightforwardly generalize to the case of several functions and several constraints . in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath104s are to be regarded as independent functions just like the @xmath89s .",
    "there are two parameterizations that we are going to discuss in this appendix : parameterization of the path by arc length and by time . in the first case ,",
    "the integral to minimize is @xmath109 while in the second case @xmath110 as we will see , there are constraints to be appended to these integrals . but before doing that , there is another subtlety that we should discuss first .",
    "it is related to the fact that in these integrals the domain of integration is not a priori known and fixed .",
    "( for example , if we knew the domain of integration in parameterization with time , then we already knew @xmath111 . )",
    "this is very important , since the standard results we quoted above are usually derived under the assumption that there is a fixed domain of integration and the variations vanish at its boundary.@xcite so in the rest of this appendix we first address the issue of variable domain in subsection [ app : var - domain ] , and then turn to the length and time parameterizations in subsections [ app : length ] and [ app : time ] , respectively .      in section [ sec : light - path ] our parametererization was over a fixed domain , namely : @xmath112 .",
    "this meant fixed lower and upper limits ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) in the integral and hence we were eligible to use the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "however , we may equally well describe the path connecting @xmath14 and @xmath15 by a function @xmath17 on an arbitrary domain @xmath115 . the travel time is still given by the same integral except for the lower and upper limits of integration : @xmath116 we wish to find such general parameterizations of the path that minimize @xmath111 .",
    "this appears to be a harder problem in calculus of variations , since : ( i ) we have to search among a larger class of functions ; and ( ii ) the domain of integration is not fixed as before , but variable",
    ".    our search will be among functions @xmath117\\to{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^3",
    ", \\qquad \\text{such that $ { { \\mathbf{x}}}(\\sigma_1)={{\\mathbf{x}}}_1 $ and $ { { \\mathbf{x}}}(\\sigma_2)={{\\mathbf{x}}}_2$.}\\ ] ] this is to be contrasted with our previous search scope , @xmath118\\to{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^3 $ ] .",
    "under a variation @xmath119 in the function and @xmath120 in the domain , the boundary conditions imply @xmath121 which means @xmath122 now the variation of @xmath123 becomes @xmath124 \\delta x_i ds + \\left [ l - \\dot x_i \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\dot x_i } \\right]_{\\sigma_2 } \\delta\\sigma_2 - \\left [ l - \\dot x_i \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\dot x_i } \\right]_{\\sigma_1 } \\delta\\sigma_1,\\ ] ] where summation over @xmath125 is implied . by inspecting",
    "it is clear that @xmath101 is a homogeneous function of @xmath37 and hence the last two terms in @xmath126 vanish .",
    "thus we are again left with the standard euler - lagrange equation and the result eq .  .",
    "again we observe the non - uniqueness in the solutions : if @xmath127\\to{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^3 $ ] satisfies eq .",
    ", then @xmath128\\to{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^3\\ ] ] is also a solution , for any monotonic function @xmath39 satisfying @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    we could have guessed that the euler - lagrange equations remain untouched : a function that minimizes the integral among all functions with variable domains , also does so among the smaller class of functions which share its own domain .",
    "so in general , the euler - lagrange equations provide a necessary condition for variable - domain problems .",
    "the boundary terms that appear in eq .   may provide additional conditions , although in our case they do nt .",
    "we are now in a position to perform the variational analysis with length parameterization .",
    "so we choose to set the arc length @xmath88 run from zero to @xmath131 , the total length of the path , and work with @xmath132 .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath140 gives the usual euler - lagrange equation  as we saw earlier this is always a necessary condition in variable domain problems  which reads @xmath144 now this equation involves the unknown function @xmath104 , so we need to use @xmath143 to get rid of it . in order to do so ,",
