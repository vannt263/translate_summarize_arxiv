    "knowledge of earth s internal structure and composition has primarily been obtained through complimentary approaches of geophysical and geochemical investigation .",
    "however , debate still persists about the mechanisms responsible for generating the chemical and physical characteristics of earth s mantle observed today , as well as their evolution through time .",
    "the large - scale composition of the mantle may be inferred in part from mantle - derived melts erupted at or near the earth s surface , including mid - ocean ridge basalts ( morb ) and ocean island basalts ( oib ) .",
    "therefore , analyses of oceanic basalts remain a key component in understanding the geochemical complexities of the mantle .",
    "trace element ratios , radiogenic isotope variations ( e.g. , sr , nd , hf , os , pb ) , and noble gas systematics have traditionally been studied in mantle - derived samples to better understand the chemical composition and physical processes occurring within the mantle throughout earth history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ocean island basalts exhibit systematic differences in isotope compositions when compared with morb ; this has generally been attributed to mantle heterogeneities arising from the recycling of various materials into oib mantle source regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various different mantle endmembers have been proposed to explain the variable sr , nd , and pb isotope ratios , in that each plume samples chemically distinct mantle sources @xcite ; this has been recently extended to hf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and os isotopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the main compositional mantle endmembers include dmm ( depleted morb mantle ) , em-1 ( enriched mantle 1 ) , em-2 ( enriched mantle 2 ) , and himu ( `` high-@xmath4 '' , where @xmath4 is defined as the time - integrated ^238^u/^204^pb ) .",
    "each endmember is defined in terms of their relative radiogenic sr and pb isotope characteristics : dmm displays low ^87^sr/^86^sr and relatively unradiogenic pb , em-1 has intermediate ^87^sr/^86^sr and low ^206^pb/^204^pb , em-2 shows high ^87^sr/^86^sr and intermediate ^206^pb/^204^pb , and himu is defined by low ^87^sr/^86^sr and high ^206^pb/^204^pb @xcite .",
    "these geochemical characteristics are thought to be a reflection of specific lithologies present as a component of the source : em-1 may incorporate recycled lower continental crust material or pelagic sediments @xcite or delaminated subcontinental lithosphere @xcite , em-2 may arise from the recycling of continental - derived sediments @xcite , and himu may involve recycled oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle @xcite .",
    "it has even been proposed that an ancient marine carbonate component may exist in the himu mantle source @xcite .",
    "the traditional mantle endmembers represent extremes in terms of isotopic composition , with each oib location potentially representing a unique mixture of mantle components .",
    "however , linking observations of chemical heterogeneity of oib with the mechanisms responsible for generating such variations is currently a major challenge in mantle geochemistry .",
    "in contrast to radiogenic isotope systems , the mantle end - members are less well defined by stable isotope variations ; although o , mg , and ca show possible recycled signatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , generally it is assumed that the mantle is homogeneous with respect to most stable isotope systems . to date , this has been the case for silicon isotopes .",
    "for example , samples of and from the shallow mantle ( peridotites and morb ) are assumed to be representative of the si isotope composition of bulk silicate earth ( bse ) , with any si isotope heterogeneity being obliterated through convective mantle mixing @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study of the si isotope composition of oib has not previously been performed ; only a limited number of high - precision analyses are present in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "given the implications of possible mantle heterogeneities on a wide variety of mantle processes and the importance of an accurate characterization of the isotopic composition of bse for geo- and cosmo - chemical comparison purposes , a dedicated investigation of potential si isotope variations in oib is warranted .",
    "the si isotope system is a potentially useful tool with which to investigate recycling of terrestrial surface materials within the mantle .",
    "silicon is a key element in silicate minerals and is composed of three stable isotopes : ^28^si ( 92.23% ) , ^29^si ( 4.68% ) , and ^30^si ( 3.09% ) .",
    "relatively large si isotope fractionations have been observed as the result of low - temperature bio- and geo - chemical surficial / supergene processes , with the light si isotopes becoming preferentially enriched in precipitated silica phases compared to dissolved si in the fluid phase @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the si isotope systematics in low - temperature environments , including chert formation @xcite , diatom formation @xcite , and silicate weathering @xcite , have shown that si isotope variations can range over several per mil in surface environments .",
    "in contrast , high - temperature igneous processes typically result in relatively small fractionations ; terrestrial igneous materials display only a limited range ( @xmath00.2 per mil on the ^30^si/^28^si ratio ) of si isotope compositions @xcite , with the bulk silicate earth being relatively homogeneous ( @xmath1 ^ 30^si = @xmath20.29 @xmath3 0.07 , 2 sd ; * ? ? ?",
    "partial mantle melting to form basaltic melts does not appear to generate large si isotope fractionations @xcite compared to low - temperature processes , so incorporation of recycled surface materials in the mantle could produce si isotope variations that may be observed in oib .    here",
    "we present high - precision si isotope data obtained by multi - collector inductively - coupled - plasma mass - spectrometry ( mc - icp - ms ) for a suite of oib , including samples representative of the em-1 , em-2 , and himu mantle endmembers , to quantify potential si isotope variations in the mantle and assess the processes that may generate si isotope variability .",
    "a set of 46 oib representing locations in the pacific , atlantic , and indian oceans were selected for si isotope analysis . in particular ,",
    "samples were selected to represent the proposed mantle endmembers , including eight samples from pitcairn ( em-1 ) , eleven samples from samoa ( em-2 ) , and four samples from mangaia ( himu ) .",
    "additional samples represent geographic locations with unique geochemical features , such as primitive noble gas compositions , or areas that display less extreme mantle endmember compositions .",
    "for example , three samples were selected from so nicolau , one of the northern islands of cape verde that has been identified as himu - like based on radiogenic pb isotope compositions and low ^87^sr/^86^sr , but that also exhibits high ^3^he/^4^he ( @xmath5 r / r@xmath6 ) , possibly indicative of a primitive lower mantle component @xcite .",
    "similarly , two samples were selected from st .",
    "helena , which has been identified as himu - like based on radiogenic isotope compositions but displays low ^3^he/^4^he @xcite .",
    "six samples were selected from the canary islands , particularly the islands of el hierro and la palma , whose mantle sources have been interpreted to contain distinct proportions of recycled oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle based on he  o  sr ",
    "nd  os  pb isotope systematics @xcite .",
    "four icelandic samples from volcanic complexes in the northern rift zone ( nrz ) that display depleted tholeiitic compositions were selected .",
    "iceland is one of the most well - studied oib - type localities due to its association with both a spreading center ( the mid - atlantic ridge ) and a deep - seated mantle plume @xcite . the relatively unradiogenic he and ne isotope ratios measured previously in these samples compared to global oib is possible evidence for a deep , undegassed mantle source @xcite .    ^29^si versus @xmath1 ^ 30^si for oib .",
    "all data are within error ( @xmath3 2 se ) of the calculated mass - dependent equilibrium ( solid line , slope 0.5178 ) and kinetic ( dashed line , slope 0.5092 ) fractionation lines . ]",

    "recent theoretical calculations of equilibrium fractionation factors show that si isotopes may be fractionated between silicate minerals at the elevated pressure conditions in the lower mantle @xcite .",

    "conversely , canary island samples have ^3^he/^4^he values within the range of morb @xcite , but have variable si isotope compositions .",

    "this raises the question of whether there is a common mechanism that generates the isotopically - light si and o isotope compositions of oib . like si isotopes , o isotopes display large variations in surface environments relative to mantle materials ; therefore , o isotopes can be a sensitive measure of low - temperature processes , particularly water - rock interactions .",
    "altered oceanic crust can be enriched in the heavier isotopes of o through low - temperature alteration by surface fluids ( characteristic of the upper oceanic crust ) or depleted in the heavier isotopes through high - temperature hydrothermal alteration ( characteristic of the lower oceanic crust ) , so variations in @xmath1 ^ 18^o may indicate the presence of oceanic crustal material in oib magmas .",

    "it is difficult at this point to distinguish between recycling and assimilation of oceanic crust based solely on si isotopes .",
    "however , due to the much lower concentration of dissolved si in fluids compared to the high o concentration , and the similar si isotope composition of si saturated hydrothermal fluids to their rock setting @xcite , the effect of hydrothermal alteration is likely to be much smaller for si isotopes than for o isotopes .",

    "this suggests that crustal assimilation is not the main cause of the light si enrichments in this oib suite , but processes of crustal recycling may play an important role in generating si isotope variability in the mantle .",

    "the presence in the mantle of unaltered continent - derived material ( in the form of lower continental crust or sediments derived from the upper continental crust that has not been altered in si isotope composition due to metamorphic dehydration and fluid - rock interaction during subduction ) is unlikely to significantly affect oib si isotope compositions .",

    "a similar mass balance shows that 1 - 2% sediment added to peridotite mantle is unlikely to measurably shift the @xmath1 ^ 30^si of the mixture , which can explain the morb - like @xmath1 ^ 30^si values of em-1 and em-2 type oib despite their hosting some recycled marine sediment .",
    "the addition of more than a few percent of sediments in the sources of oib , particularly himu - type , is inconsistent with pb and sr isotopic constraints and trace - element ratios unless sediments are significantly modified during subduction zone processing @xcite",

    "<S> the study of silicon ( si ) isotopes in ocean island basalts ( oib ) has the potential to discern between different models for the origins of geochemical heterogeneities in the mantle . relatively large ( @xmath0several per mil per atomic mass unit ) </S>",
    "<S> si isotope fractionation occurs in low - temperature environments during biochemical and geochemical precipitation of dissolved si , where the precipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes relative to the dissolved si . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , only a limited range ( @xmath0tenths of a per mil ) of si isotope fractionation has been observed from high - temperature igneous processes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of crustal material within oib mantle source regions that experienced relatively low - temperature surface processes in a manner similar to other stable isotope systems , such as oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> characterizing the isotopic composition of the mantle is also of central importance to the use of the si isotope system as a basis for comparisons with other planetary bodies ( e.g. , moon , mars , asteroids ) .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first comprehensive suite of high - precision si isotope data obtained by mc - icp - ms for a diverse suite of oib . </S>",
    "<S> samples originate from ocean islands in the pacific , atlantic , and indian ocean basins and include representative end - members for the em-1 , em-2 , and himu mantle components . on average , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 ^ 30^si values for oib ( @xmath20.32 @xmath3 0.09 , 2 sd ) are in general agreement with previous estimates for the @xmath1 ^ 30^si value of bulk silicate earth ( @xmath20.29 @xmath3 0.07 , 2 sd ; * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> nonetheless , some small systematic variations are present ; specifically , most himu - type ( mangaia ; cape verde ; la palma , canary islands ) and iceland oib are enriched in the lighter isotopes of si ( @xmath1 ^ 30^si values lower than morb ) , consistent with recycled altered oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle in their mantle sources . </S>"
