    "the star formation rate ( @xmath5 ) of a galaxy is an extremely import astrophysical quantity , a key component to understanding the detailed evolution of a single galaxy or that of a population of galaxies across cosmic time . to this end ,",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) is one of the most diagnostically important parts of a galaxy s spectrum .",
    "it is often interpreted as a measure of recent star formation , given that stars younger than 300 myr , including young , massive o and b stars , emit most of their energy in the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , the uv is essential for tracing star formation across cosmic time . at high redshift ,",
    "the light observed in the optical is the galaxy s rest frame uv , which has been redshifted to longer wavelengths .",
    "the uv , however , is also one of the most challenging parts of the spectrum to interpret reliably . while it is generally a good measure of recent star formation , the uv is also highly sensitive to dust .",
    "uv light is absorbed by dust grains , which re - emit in the infrared .",
    "consequently , uv - only star formation rates ( @xmath5s ) underestimate the true @xmath5 of a galaxy , usually by factors of a few in typical disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though it can be as much as a factor of 100 or more in ulirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , stellar models in the uv are difficult to create and are neither well tested nor well - calibrated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "models are particularly problematic for highly evolved low - mass stars , which also emit modestly in the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making the uv flux from older stellar populations particularly difficult to interpret @xcite . finally , uv observations are difficult for low - redshift galaxies because they requires a space or balloon - borne mission , like the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the uvot camera on _ swift _ @xcite , or the uvis channel on the wide field planetary camera 3 ( wfc3/uvis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope_.    further complications when interpreting uv observations arise from assumptions on the initial mass function ( imf ) and the @xmath5",
    ". models generally assume that ( 1 ) the imf is fully populated and ( 2 ) that the sfr is constant at recent times .",
    "the first of these assumptions is likely to hold only over large areas or in small but high star formation surface density regions .",
    "the second requirement arise because , at uv wavelengths , up to 90% of the emission in the far uv ( @xmath0 ) and near uv ( @xmath1 ) is from stars that are younger than 100 myr and 300 myr , respectively ; conversion to a @xmath5 therefore assumes that the @xmath5 has been uniform over that period of time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although a wide range of science is enabled with these assumptions , the circumstances under which they are reliable remain unclear . for example , recent work on the imf has shown that for sufficiently low sfrs and/or small spatial scales , the high - mass imf is not fully populated @xcite , and may even systematically vary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , in low - mass galaxies and/or on small spatial scales in large galaxies , star formation histories ( @xmath2s ) tend to be bursty as opposed to constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the consequences of these deviations from the fiducial assumptions are not well - understood and may have a significant impact on our interpretation of the observed flux and consequently on the @xmath5 .    given the astrophysical importance of @xmath5 measurements , tests of the above models and assumptions are crucial . a number of studies have examined how interpreting the observed galaxy flux is affected by some of these assumptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite analyzed the scale dependence of @xmath5 tracers .",
    "they found broad agreement between tracers on 1 kpc scales , presumably because variations between regions of active star formation and diffuse emission ( i.e. , from older stellar populations ) have averaged out .",
    "the scale at which this occurs will vary from galaxy to galaxy depending on the intensity of star formation as well as the structure and transparency of the interstellar medium .    in this paper , we take an alternate approach to @xmath5 analysis that sidesteps some of the above assumptions .",
    "we use @xmath2s and dust distributions derived from resolved stars and stellar population synthesis models to create maps of synthetic @xmath0 and @xmath1 flux on sub - kpc scales .",
    "the @xmath2s come from @xcite , who used optical would be reliable .",
    "the optical data are the deepest and therefore provide the best leverage on measuring the @xmath2 . ] resolved star data , taken as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) program , to model the spatially - resolved recent @xmath2 of 9000 regions ( 0.01 sq .",
    "kpc in size ) in the northeast quadrant of m31 ( figure [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "use of these detailed @xmath2s allows us to relax the constant @xmath5 assumption , and the poisson likelihood sampling in the @xmath2 derivation process implicitly corrects the @xmath2s for imf sampling , which is included in the uncertainty estimate .",
    "we compare the synthetic flux maps with far- and near - uv _ galex _ observations @xcite to analyze the effect of non - constant @xmath2s on uv flux over a wide range of environments within a single galaxy .",
    "this methodology facilitates an end - to - end test verifying the connection between massive star formation , uv flux , and the ability to interpret and/or infer uv populations through analysis of optical stellar populations .",

    "the @xmath2s for each region are presented in @xcite .",

    "@xcite initiated this work in m31 , using techniques similar to that of @xcite to model the uv flux in 33 star - forming regions in m31 s star - forming ring and compare uv flux - derived @xmath5s to those measured from optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd)-derived @xmath2s .",
    "they found that the @xmath5s derived from cmds were , on average , consistent with those derived from the extinction - corrected @xmath0 flux to within @xmath6 , and that 1/3 of the scatter could be attributed to metallicity differences : the flux calibration assumes constant solar metallicity , while the metallicity of the sfhs varies with time .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that a wide range of @xmath2s can produce the same amount of @xmath0 flux .",
    "the analysis of resolved stellar populations offers a different way to probe the effects of simplifying assumptions on integrated flux measurements .",
    "unfortunately , tests such as the one performed by @xcite have been limited in scope , both due to the inability to gather the required resolved star data outside of the local group and because the vast majority of galaxies in the nearby universe are dwarf galaxies .",

    "they found that fluctuations in the @xmath2 can cause factor of two variations in uv luminosities relative to constant @xmath5 assumptions , and that stars older than 100 myr can contribute up to 30% of fuv emission .",
    "using the @xmath2s from resolved cmd fitting is just one way to model the uv flux with stellar photometry .",
    "another method is to fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of individual stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such fitting , though , ideally produces the star s full spectrum , both reddened and intrinsic , which can then be used to infer the flux at wavelengths that were not observed .",
    "the phat survey motivated the development of the bayesian extinction and stellar tool ( beast ; * ? ? ? * ) , an sed fitter , which could be used to provide and independent check of the results presented in this paper .",
    "sed fitting will , however , miss any stars below the detection limit because it requires that they be detected in multiple filters .",

    ", milky way - like galaxy is important for interpreting the observations of massive galaxies that dominate star - forming galaxy samples .",
    "in the nearby universe , we are limited to only a few large spiral galaxies with sufficiently well - resolved populations .",
    "of these , m31 data has the widest wavelength coverage , the best resolved star data , and the highest resolution .",
    "m31 is a more massive and metal - rich system than nearby dwarf galaxies , providing an important laboratory for testing the assumptions made when using integrated uv light .",

    "the ` match ` implementation of the padova isochrones only reaches to @xmath21(time ) = 6.6 , so we renormalized the sfr in the youngest age bin to reach time = 0 , conserving the mass created in that time bin : @xmath30 we also increased the age resolution of the @xmath2 to 6.5@xmath31 yr .",
    "we determined this value by splitting the smallest time bin into 20 separate bins . in @xmath21(time )",
    "space we then interpolated the ssp seds to the @xmath2 time points , weighted each interpolated sed by the sfr at each @xmath2 time point , and summed the seds to create the integrated intrinsic ( i.e. , dust - free ) model sed .",
    "we note that we used the full 14 gyr @xmath2 in this process despite the fact that @xcite stress that the @xmath2s are only robust to 500 myr ago .",
    "we will discuss the effects of the @xmath2 timescale in the appendix .    to include the effects of dust , we created the integrated , attenuated model sed in the same manner as the intrinsic sed , except that we reddened each individual ssp sed component before weighting by the mass .",
    "to redden the sed , we split each ssp sed into 30 identical component seds .",
    "each component was then attenuated according to the @xcite extinction curve with @xmath26 , assuming a uniform random @xmath10 distribution drawn between @xmath32 and @xmath32 + @xmath33 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the best - fit parameters of the two - component extinction model used to derive the @xmath2 from the cmd @xcite .",

    "we note , however , that three of the fields in b11 were not observed .",
    "these three fields overlap completely with fields from b09 , decreasing the total amount of overlap . we compared the output reddened nuv flux values in 10 of these overlapping pixels .",
    "we found the agreement to be within 10 ",

    "we also constructed maps of observed _ galex _ flux ( @xmath45 ) , matched to the sampling of the modeled synthetic flux maps .",

    "foreground stars are typically at a very different absolute magnitude than m31 stars , and it is unlikely that any foreground stars were inadvertently included in the cmd modeling .",
    "additionally , foreground stars do nt produce features in the synthetic maps because the fluxes in those maps are derived from the @xmath5 of a _ distribution _ of stars , rather than single stars , so while a single bright star may dominate the pixel in the observed map , it has less of an effect in the modeled map because it is averaged out in the total @xmath2 from which the modeled flux is derived .",

    "there is also a slight trend in the @xmath1 data .",
    "the synthetic flux is generally in very good agreement in regions of low observed flux but under - estimated in regions of high observed flux .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the right panel of figure [ fig : nuvmaps ] where the regions between and outside of the ring features ( low observed flux ) are gray to light blue in color , indicating only slightly more synthetic flux than observed flux , and the ring regions ( high observed flux ) are red , indicating more observed flux than synthetic flux .    at the high flux end of the @xmath1 distribution",
    ", the inconsistency must lie with the modeled data .",
    "one possibility could be our treatment of dust , because the regions of high flux coincide with the dustiest regions .",
    "however , both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are treated the same way and this problem does not affect the @xmath0 , which should be even more sensitive to errors in the dust model ; we can not assume that the dust is too high in the @xmath1 and just right in the @xmath0 .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath1 band includes the 2175 bump . if we were to reduce the strength of the bump at the same @xmath46 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this change would increase the flux in the @xmath1 , bringing the ratio of synthetic to observed flux closer to one but leaving the @xmath0 flux unchanged . a variation in bump strength",
    "would also have little effect on the low - flux regions which are also generally low - dust regions and are therefore less affected by the robustness of the extinction curve .    a final factor that could contribute to the trend seen in the @xmath1 data is timescale .",

    "the overall agreement between @xmath38 and @xmath45 confirms that our modeling procedure is generally robust and justifies the assumptions we used to model the flux , including the assumed imf , stellar models and spectral library , and the extinction model .",
    "while the modeling can certainly be made more complex , it is reassuring to know that we can use all of this knowledge to derive @xmath2s , synthesize seds , and successfully recreate detailed maps in the uv , all from photometry in only two optical bands .",
    "the above comparisons strongly support the overall reliability of the @xmath2s presented in @xcite , particularly the dust parameters derived in the @xmath2 fitting process .",
    "therefore , before we proceed to a discussion of the un - reddened maps , we highlight some additional considerations that could affect the modeled flux .",
    "the _ galex _ data primarily suffers from poisson uncertainties due to the exposure time . for each of the five dis images in this study",
    ", we assume an average exposure time of @xmath51 s in the @xmath0 channel and @xmath52 s in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "the uncertainties are only a few percent at @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath1 uncertainties are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the scatter in figure  [ fig : fluxratiocompare ] is much larger than the above poisson uncertainties allow . as a result ,",
    "the scatter seen in figure  [ fig : fluxratiocompare ] is most likely dominated by the modeling process .",
    "we now discuss possible sources of uncertainty in our synthetic data .",
    "there are four major factors that could contribute to the scatter observed in the synthetic fluxes : ( 1 ) @xmath2 uncertainties , ( 2 ) imf sampling incompleteness , ( 3 ) differences between the dust model and the physical properties of the dust , and ( 4 ) stellar evolution model uncertainties . because each of these effects is coupled to the others ( e.g. , the @xmath2 of each region is dependent on the stellar models used and is also degenerate with the dust in that region ) , it is difficult to constrain the uncertainties from each source separately to high precision .",
    "instead , we provide a qualitative discussion of each source and its effect on the resulting flux .",
    "we first consider the role of uncertainties in the @xmath2 . at the native time resolution of 0.1 dex , the uncertainties on the sfr in a single time bin can range from @xmath5510100% .",
    "the exact number depends on the number of luminous main sequence stars in each region @xcite , which will affect the certainty of star formation happening in one time bin as opposed to the adjacent time bin .",
    "these uncertainties naturally decrease when averaged over larger region sizes or longer timescales .",
    "the uncertainties on the @xmath5 in @xcite were determined using a hybrid markov chain monte carlo routine @xcite to produce a sample of 10,000 @xmath2s . to determine the magnitude of the uncertainties propagated through from the @xmath2s , we ran 1000 of these @xmath2s in each region through our sed modeling routine .",
    "we take the uncertainty on the flux to be the distribution of fluxes derived from this sample .",
    "we note that the uncertainties derived in this manner will be upper limits .",
    "most of the stars that are responsible for the observed uv flux are present in the cmds , and these stars also account for much of the observed star formation .",
    "this is especially true in the @xmath0 , where it is expected that younger populations , which we observe on the cmd , are responsible for most of the observed flux .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fluxuncs ] , we show the uncertainties in the modeled flux as a function of observed flux for both the reddened and dust - free synthetic flux .",
    "the uncertainties are highly asymmetric , especially at the low - flux end because of asymmetries in the @xmath2 uncertainties .",
    "when the best - fit @xmath5 in a time bin is zero , the uncertainty on that @xmath5 is only positive .",
    "the regions that populate the low - flux end of this figure tend to have little or no star formation in the most recent 100 myr . over the 100 myr timescales of interest in this paper , the random uncertainties on the synthetic flux due to the @xmath2 derivation are up to an order of magnitude at the very faint end , though only a factor of a few or less at the bright end .",
    "the inset in each subpanel shows the ratio of the total uncertainties shown in figure [ fig : fluxuncs ] to the size of the scatter in figure [ fig : fluxratiocompare ] .",
    "we repeat the same exercise in figure [ fig : fluxuncs_sfr_recent ] , except we plot the uncertainties as a function of @xmath5 averaged over the most recent 100 myr .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : fluxuncs ] , the uncertainties are asymmetric .",
    "as expected , they generally decrease toward higher @xmath5 .",
    "we next consider uncertainties in the dust model used to model the @xmath2s and the flux . as described in @xcite , we modeled dust in the optical cmd - derived @xmath2s with a two - component top - hat model designed to account for constant extinction along the line of sight , and differential extinction internal to the galaxy .",
    "the cmd residuals suggest that this model is reasonable for the young stars , but extrapolation of this model to the uv requires assumptions about the attenuation curve and the 2175  bump . in the modeling process",
    ", we assume that the attenuation curve , @xmath46 , and the strength of the 2175  bump are constant across the disk . however , it is possible that these have spatial variation , and this could lead to scatter in the flux ratios .",
    "robust sed fitters , such as the beast @xcite may be able to measure such region - to - region variation . additionally , scattering of light by dust ( section [ subsec : scattered_light ] ) may alter the effective attenuation curve in a given region , producing extra flux that does not originate in that region and giving the attenuation curve a shape that is different from that of a perfectly known extinction curve .",
    "a third source of uncertainty is incomplete sampling of the stellar imf .",
    "the uv light in a region is highly dependent on the number of massive stars . in modeling the @xmath2s",
    ", we assumed a fully - sampled imf .",
    "when the @xmath5 @xmath56 @xmath57 , however , the imf may not be fully populated in that there are too few massive stars .",
    "this is most likely to occur in regions that are physically small or regions where the @xmath5 is low or non - existent .",
    "that said , low flux regions tend to contain mostly older stellar populations .",
    "as such , stochastic effects do not make as much of a difference because the uv is coming from stars further down the luminosity function . in high - flux and high-@xmath5 regions , a scale of 30  40 pc ( approximately the size of a 4000@xmath58 , 5 myr old cluster ) appears to be large enough to avoid imf sampling issues @xcite .",
    "additionally , several studies have shown that stochastic sampling of the imf  even at very low sfr  has less impact on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluxes because they result from integration over a wide mass range and are less dependent on the most massive stars than an ionizing luminosity such as h@xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in general , the 100 pc @xmath20 400 pc regions in this study are more than large enough to avoid effects of stochastic sampling in high @xmath5 regions . in",
    "lower @xmath5 regions , stochastic sampling could potentially affect our results .",
    "however , incomplete sampling of the imf does not overwhelmingly contribute to the observed scatter in the flux ratios .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluxes are integrated over a stellar mass that reaches down to @xmath603 ",
    "5 @xmath58 on the main sequence .",
    "additionally , stochastic effects of the imf are incorporated into the uncertainties on the @xmath2s as described in @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that incomplete sampling of the imf contributes significantly to the scatter in the flux ratios beyond the uncertainties already accounted for in the sfh measurements .",
    "the last source of uncertainty is from deficiencies in the stellar models used to derive the @xmath2s and to model the flux .",
    "just as the number of massive stars affects the observed uv light , discrepancies between the synthetic and true uv properties of these massive , metal rich stars could introduce scatter into the flux ratios .",
    "this uncertainty is the most challenging to quantify .",
    "the fidelity of the stellar models will be the same in all locations , but the impact of the models will vary from region to region due to variation with stellar type and mass and therefore with @xmath2 and imf sampling . perhaps most importantly , stellar models in the uv are poorly calibrated due to the paucity of massive , metal - rich stars in the local universe .      based on the above effects ,",
    "the scatter in the flux ratios shown in figure  [ fig : fluxratiocompare ] is dominated by the uncertainties in the @xmath2 , which include scatter due to incomplete sampling of the imf .",
    "fluxes in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are often attributed to timescales of @xmath29100 myr and @xmath29300 myr , respectively , because most of the uv emission comes from the hottest , most massive stars that dominate younger stellar populations @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that older populations emit in the uv as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with often as much as 20 - 30% of the total emission in the @xmath0 or @xmath1 coming from these stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the contribution from older populations is generally negligible in regions of high recent star formation .",
    "however , in regions of low sfr , this contribution can be non - negligible , particularly in the @xmath1 . unfortunately , the cmd modeling in @xcite excluded regions of the cmd in the fit that are most sensitive to old stellar populations , and thus our ability to model the uv contribution from older star formation is limited . including this contribution would be most likely to increase the low @xmath5 intensity region fluxes while leaving the high @xmath5 intensity regions unaffected .      a portion of a galaxy s uv light can be diffuse and not associated with an obvious star - forming region .",
    "this diffuse uv emission is found between visible spiral arms or rings . in some cases",
    ", this fraction can be quite significant ( up to 65% in m33 ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of suggestions for the origination of this diffuse light , including the dispersal of b  type stars after the dissolution of their natal clusters , a low level of diffuse star formation , or the scattering by dust of uv photons produced in bright star  forming regions @xcite .",
    "this scattered light may redistribute the flux in the observed uv maps in a manner that is not captured in our synthetic maps .",
    "we can , however , use our modeled data to examine the extent of scattered light in m31 .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : fuvmaps ] shows the log ratio of the observed to the modeled reddened @xmath0 flux .",
    "blue pixels have more synthetic flux than observed with _ galex _ and red pixels have more observed flux than synthetic flux .",
    "we have predicted slightly more synthetic flux than is observed ( blue pixels ) in just over half of the regions .",
    "however , the regions in which we have under - predicted the flux have a larger offset than the regions in which we have over - predicted the flux .",
    "this excess _ galex _",
    "flux occurs primarily along the eastern side of the 10 kpc ring as well as near two large ob associations in bricks 15 & 21 .",
    "this discrepancy is particularly interesting because it is found near regions of very high , recent star formation .",
    "the many star - forming regions along the northeastern section of the ring are responsible for the bump in the star formation rate seen 50 myr ago @xcite .",
    "the excess observed flux seen near these highly star - forming regions could be an indication that some of this uv light has been scattered by dust into regions where no star formation is occurring .",
    "further analysis of scattered light is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the phat survey consists of data in six filters , two each in the nuv , the optical and the near - infrared . in the @xmath2 derivation @xcite",
    ", we used only the optical data as they are the deepest and provide the greatest leverage on the recent @xmath2 . in theory , the ultraviolet filters ( f275w and f336w ) would also provide important constraints on the recent @xmath2 . in practice ,",
    "only the brightest main sequence stars have measurements in the uv filters , which greatly reduces the age range over which the @xmath2 can be derived .",
    "therefore , the uv filters were not used in the @xmath2 derivation .",

    "the synthetic @xmath1 and f275w flux images are colored according to the log of the flux in each band .",
    "we chose b15 because it sits on the 10 kpc ring and therefore contains both active star formation and dust .",

    "the f275w data comes from the ` gst ` catalog , which contains only stars with reliable measurements ( high signal - to - noise and low crowding ) in each band .",
    "we chose to use the individually resolved stars rather than the full brick images of b15 for a number of reasons .",
    "there are only two exposures per uvis band , making it difficult to reliably clean the images of cosmic rays ( crs ) . by using the ` gst ` catalog of resolved stars with its more stringent cuts ,",
    "we avoid artifacts due to crs .",
    "there are also problems due to charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) because cte corrections were not available for wfc3 . finally ,",

    ". in particular , we can not include stars below the flux limit that were not detected .",
    "additionally , while using the ` gst ` catalog eliminates artifacts , it may also remove real detections .",

    "further analysis would require additional modeling , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the overall structure is very similar in both maps , but the synthetic map contains a factor of 2.6 more flux , with a median of 1.9 . finally , the outer ring feature follows the same pattern .",
    "the overall structure is very similar , but the total flux is 2.4 times higher in the synthetic map with a median factor of 1.2 .",
    "these differences show that in star - forming , dusty regions , the synthetic dust - free map reveals more flux than the 24 -corrected @xmath0 map .",

    "the differences discussed above lead directly to the distinction in the maps of the fraction of obscured flux in the bottom row of figure [ fig : obscured_sf ] . as already discussed , the synthetic maps require a high degree of obscuration .",
    "most of this dust occurs in the ring features , which are strong features in the obscured fraction map .",
    "however , all pixels have dust and are therefore obscured .",
    "the minimum and maximum obscuration in the synthetic maps is 19% and 97% , respectively .",
    "there is much less structure in the 24 -based obscured fraction map . in this map ,",
    "the most obscured regions are towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "the 10 kpc ring and outer ring feature are less apparent while the inner ring feature is stronger .",
    "additionally , the inner edge of each ring feature is more obscured than the feature itself ; i.e. , it is still possible to pick out the 10 kpc ring in the 24 obscured fraction map , though only at one edge .",
    "finally , we note that the bright star - forming region in b21 ( the bright feature at left edge of panel c ) has very little obscuration in the observed data suggesting that the stars in this region are old enough to have dispersed their natal cloud but have not yet reached more evolved , dusty stages .",
    "our results show that the 24 correction for dust does not work well in regions of low star formation intensity which are likely dominated by older stellar populations .",
    "the discrepancy between the synthetic dust - free flux map and the @xmath0 + 24 flux map indicates that the overall @xmath5 will also be affected .",
    "the usual method of converting a @xmath0 flux into a @xmath5 is to apply an extinction correction to the observed flux , convert the flux to luminosity , and then calculate a @xmath5 according to a standard calibration .",
    "a common calibration is that from @xcite with updates by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the dust - corrected @xmath0 luminosity with units of erg s@xmath65 and the resulting @xmath5 has units of @xmath57 .",
    "there are a variety of methods for correcting the data for dust .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsec : obscured_star_formation ] , a popular method is to multiply the 24 flux by a constant , @xmath70 , especially in relatively nearby galaxies where high quality _ spitzer _ 24 data exists .",
    "another method is to use uv color ( @xmath71 ) to correct the @xmath0 magnitude which is then converted to flux for further conversion to @xmath5 .",
    "this method is often used at high redshift .",

    "this results in an over - estimate of the @xmath5 at low @xmath73 and an under - estimate at high @xmath73 .",

    "we find that the mean flux - based @xmath5 is 0.39 dex lower than the mean cmd - based @xmath5 .",

    "any @xmath73 can map to a two order of magnitude range in @xmath79 .",
    "the only trend that exists is that the uv color correction results in an over - estimate of @xmath79 at low @xmath73 and an under - estimate at high @xmath73 . despite the absence of region - to - region correlation",
    ", the flux - weighted mean @xmath5 falls directly on the one - to - one line .",
    "we note that we could have used the synthetic , dust - free @xmath0 flux - derived @xmath5 on the x - axis instead of the 100 myr averaged @xmath5 from the cmd - derived @xmath2s .",
    "the results would be the same with an offset of the mean flux - weighted @xmath5s from the one - to - one line when using the 24 correction and a lack of correlation when using the uv color correction .",
    "we have shown that the conversion of @xmath0 flux into a @xmath5 after correcting for dust with two different prescriptions results in vastly different relations when compared with the @xmath5 determined from the cmd - derived @xmath2 ( or alternatively from using equation [ eq : sfr ] on the dust - free synthetic @xmath0 flux , @xmath63 ) .",
    "these differences are perhaps not surprising , but they do beg the question of what drives the discrepancies . at the most basic level ,",
    "the discrepancy arises either from the modeled data ( synthetic flux or cmd - based @xmath5 ) or from the @xmath5 calibrations in the literature .    as discussed in @xcite and section [ subsec : issues ] ,",
    "there are a variety of factors that affect the cmd - derived @xmath2s and the synthetic flux .",
    "the primary uncertainties come from the chosen dust parameters and uncertainties in the @xmath2s , which were only of order 10% over a 100 myr timescale .",
    "we also showed in section [ sec : uvmaps ] and figure [ fig : fluxratiocompare ] that the synthetic , reddened flux is in very good agreement with the observed _ galex _ @xmath0 flux .",
    "this suggests that the dust parameters derived from the @xmath2s are reasonable and therefore the @xmath5 derived from the cmd - derived @xmath2s is not driving the discrepancy .",
    "the inconsistencies must therefore lie with the flux calibrations .",
    "this should not be a surprising conclusion .",
    "the vast majority of @xmath5 prescriptions are designed for regions containing at least tens of thousands of stars , such as entire galaxies or bright , star - forming regions .",
    "they make assumptions about the shape of the @xmath2 , usually assuming a constant @xmath5 over some timescale .",
    "they assume that the imf in the given region is completely sampled .",
    "they assume that the region is homogenous , i.e. , stellar populations are completely mixed and they are insensitive to structure in the dust , gas , and stars .",
    "additionally , they often use only a single metallicity ( usually ) solar , and they are insensitive to metallicity evolution .",
    "most objects in the universe fall into the unresolved regime where the above assumptions are generally safe .",
    "this is especially true in the high redshift universe . in this regime ,",
    "the uv color correction is commonly used to correct the @xmath5 for dust .",
    "while figure [ fig : sfr_compare_dust_correct ] suggests that this correction is terrible in the spatially - resolved regime , the fact that the flux - averaged mean @xmath5s are in agreement suggests that it may be a reasonable choice in the unresolved regime , especially when the availability of data at ir wavelengths is limited .    in the local universe , the existing calibrations seem to work on large ( @xmath481 kpc ) scales , which is the scale at which they were calibrated . however , we showed in this paper that even the flux - weighted means over the entire galaxy are off when using the 24 correction . additionally , even on these scales ,",
    "many of the above assumptions are not applicable .",
    "nearby galaxies show highly - defined structure in spiral arms and rings , in dust lanes , and in populations of molecular clouds and other gaseous objects .",
    "this structure varies in population ; spiral arms are populated by young and blue , main sequence stars .",
    "the centers of galaxies tend to contain older , more redder populations .",
    "additionally , as structure within a galaxy is resolved , variations in stellar environment become apparent .",
    "regions of high and low star formation , of varying metallicity , and of changing stellar density are revealed .",
    "finally , the shape of the @xmath2 is important , especially when correcting for dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the assumptions made when averaging over entire galaxies can no longer be made on smaller , variable scales .",
    "in fact , making such assumptions will bias the results .",
    "nonetheless , we still want to determine @xmath5s for these galaxies and on these scales to take advantage of the increased spatial resolution .    in this paper",
    ", we have chosen to use a single prescription for each method of correcting @xmath0 flux for dust . however , many studies have examined hybrid @xmath5 tracers in an effort to determine the best combination of the data . specifically , looking at the @xmath0 + 24 combination ,",
    "the uncertainty primarily lies on the weight applied to the 24 data , @xmath80 . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xcite factor of 3.89 , which was derived for a sample of 133 nearby , star - forming galaxies . @xcite",
    "also derived a calibration between @xmath0 and 24 and found @xmath81 .",
    "both of these measurements were derived on global scales with a single data point for each galaxy .",
    "some work has been done on sub - galactic scales .",
    "@xcite presented a calibration for the @xmath0 + 24 -based @xmath5 based on a sample of 23 nearby galaxies at 750 pc scales .",
    "modulo a typo in their appendix d , their calibration requires that @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite value of @xmath80 is similar to that of @xcite , with the notable difference in the physical scales on which it was derived ( i.e. , 750 pc vs. entire galaxies ) . as discussed above ,",
    "using relations on scales other than which they were derived can be precarious . in light of this",
    ", it would seem to be safer to use the @xcite calibration instead of the @xcite calibration .    however , using @xmath83 does not significantly change the results presented in this study .",
    "the primary reason for this lack of change is that the calibration derived by @xcite and stated in @xcite differs by more than just the value of @xmath80 .",
    "the @xcite prescription for @xmath5 derived from @xmath0 + 24 observations is : @xmath84 which is simply a combination of equations [ eq:24microncorrect ] and [ eq : sfr ] .",
    "the @xcite prescription is : @xmath85 the difference in the conversion factor from luminosity to @xmath5 effectively offsets the differences that result from the change in the value of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we have chosen not to present new plots created by using this slightly different , spatially - resolved calibration factor , but instead describe the changes that result .",
    "a change in the @xmath5 calibration will have an effect on the fraction of obscured flux ( figure [ fig : obscured_sf ] and on the relationship between the flux - based @xmath5 and the cmd - based @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : sfr_compare_dust_correct ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : obscured_sf ] , the primary difference is that the regions of highest flux shown in panel d have slightly more flux when using the @xcite calibration , and the fraction of obscured star formation ( panel e ) is therefore higher across the galaxy .",
    "the total obscured flux increases from 72% to 80% , the overall morphology of the maps does not change , and the differences discussed in section [ subsec : obscured_star_formation ] remain .",
    "increasing @xmath80 improves the relationship between the cmd - based @xmath5 and the flux - based @xmath5 improves ; however , as already noted , that improvement is offset by the change in the multiplicative factor that converts a dust - corrected luminosity to a @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath5 derived with the @xcite prescription is offset from the cmd - based @xmath5 by a factor of 2.3 compared to 2.5 for the @xcite calibration .",
    "consequently , figure [ fig : sfr_compare_dust_correct ] is largely unchanged .",
    "therefore , while it is generally acknowledged that the global calibration of @xmath80 will break down on small scales , the local calibration  derived on scales that are 28 times larger than those presented in this study  does not perform much better .",
    "more recently , @xcite calculated @xmath80 ( they call it @xmath86 and examine other infrared tracers longward of 24 as well ) in 8 different galaxies and found a wide distribution ranging from 1.55 to 13.45 with a mean of 8.11 .",
    "they stress that this factor has important galaxy - to - galaxy variations , as well as local vs. global variations that should not be overlooked . uncertainty in this factor",
    "is is clearly an issue in this study as well .",
    "had we used the @xcite value of 8.11 in this paper , we would have found much better agreement between the flux - based @xmath5 and the cmd - based @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite actually present two different parameterizations of their factor @xmath86 based on @xmath0-nir color and on nir luminosity density .",
    "these parameterizations allow @xmath86 to vary from galaxy - to - galaxy . however , they emphasize that these parameterizations should not be used on scales below 500 pc , and therefore should not be used at the spatial scales presented here .",
    "further testing and analysis of these parameterizations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is clear , though , that as higher spatial resolution becomes available beyond the most nearby galaxies , such methods for reliably determining the @xmath5 while accounting for galaxy - to - galaxy variation are needed .",
    "we have used spatially - resolved @xmath2s derived from optical resolved star data to model the seds of over 9000 sub - kpc regions in m31 and produce detailed maps of synthetic reddened and dust - free uv flux across the entire area covered by the phat survey .",
    "the @xmath2s were derived by @xcite  using @xmath87 and @xmath88 photometry from the phat survey .",
    "both intrinsic and attenuated seds were derived from the @xmath2s using fsps .",
    "these seds were convolved with the _ galex _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 response curves to generate synthetic fluxes , @xmath38 .",
    "all of the flux values were then assembled into an overall map using montage .",
    "the pixels correspond to physical areas of @xmath89 .",
    "we also used montage to construct maps of the observed uv flux , @xmath45 , using _",
    "galex _ dis images and 24 @xcite , as well as @xmath90 from the spatially - resolved @xmath2s , all on the same spatial scale .",
    "the agreement between the observed flux maps and the reddened modeled flux maps is encouraging , especially given that they were derived from only photometry in two optical bands .",
    "they indicate that models of uv emission and dust extinction are fairly accurate .",
    "the median log ratio of the synthetic reddened flux to the observed flux is 0.03 and -0.03 in the fuv and nuv , respectively , with standard deviations of 0.24 in the @xmath0 and 0.16 in the @xmath1 .",
    "this agreement confirms the robustness of our modeling procedure and justifies the assumptions made in the modeling routine .",
    "the scatter in the relation between observed _ galex _ flux and synthetic , reddened flux is primarily due to uncertainties on the @xmath2s used in the modeling process .",
    "these uncertainties include a factor due to incomplete sampling of the imf .",
    "we compared our synthetic reddened and dust - free @xmath0 flux maps with corresponding maps from observations .",
    "the synthetic reddened map was compared to the observed _ galex _ @xmath0 map .",
    "the dust - free map was compared to map derived from a combination of @xmath0 + 24 data . in the synthetic @xmath0",
    "flux maps , 88% of the flux is obscured by dust . in the observed maps ,",
    "71% is obscured .",
    "this suggests that the 24 correction results in an under - estimate of the total @xmath0 flux .",
    "we converted the observed flux map into a map of @xmath5 using two common prescriptions , one using 24 to correct for dust and the other using uv color .",
    "we compared the resulting @xmath5s with those determined from the @xcite @xmath2s averaged over the past 100 myr . while the morphology of the relation between the cmd - derived @xmath5 and that calculated using the 24 correction was good , the _ galex _ + 24 -derived @xmath5 was under - estimated by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "conversely , the uv - color correction resulted in a flux - weighted mean @xmath5 in good agreement with that derived from the cmds , but the relation shows no correlation between the two @xmath5s as would be expected .",
    "the results we present in this paper provide an end - to - end verification of the @xmath2 results presented in @xcite and show that we have the ability to model flux in a variety of bandpasses given optical data and appropriate assumptions for the stellar imf , a set of models describing stellar spectra and evolution , and an extinction model . while modeling flux in other bands provides different challenges",

    "while most of the uv flux comes from stars that are 100 to 300 myr , approximately 20 - 30% of the emission at @xmath0 and @xmath1 wavelengths comes from stars that are older than this ( see discussion in section [ subsec : emissiontimescales ] ) .",

    "<S> the predicted uv flux also agrees well with the observed flux , with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is particularly impressive given that we used only optical photometry to construct these uv maps . </S>",
    "<S> having verified the synthetic reddened maps , we use the dust - free maps to examine properties of obscured flux and star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our dust - free and reddened maps of @xmath0 flux with the observed _ galex _ @xmath0 flux and @xmath0 + 24 flux to examine the fraction of obscured flux . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the maps of synthetic flux require that 90% of the @xmath0 flux in m31 is obscured by dust , while the _ galex_-based methods suggest that 70% of the @xmath0 flux is absorbed by dust . </S>",
    "<S> this 30% increase in the estimate of the obscured flux is driven by significant differences between the dust - free synthetic @xmath0 flux and that derived when correcting the observed @xmath0 flux for dust absorption with 24 emission observations . the difference is further illustrated when we compare the @xmath5s derived from the @xmath0 + 24 flux with the 100 myr average @xmath5 from the cmd - based @xmath2s . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 24 -corrected @xmath0 flux underestimates the @xmath5 by a factor of 2.3  2.5 , depending on the chosen calibration . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be reduced by allowing for variability in the weight applied to the 24 data , as has been recently suggested in the literature . </S>"
