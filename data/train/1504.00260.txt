    "in a series of papers @xcite , the authors studied cluster algebras of finite type in terms of the combinatorics and geometry of finite coxeter groups , and in particular sortable elements and cambrian lattices . in @xcite ,",
    "these constructions were extended to infinite coxeter groups .",
    "sortable elements and cambrian semilattices were shown in @xcite to produce combinatorial models of cluster algebras of infinite type , with an important limitation : sortable elements can only model the part of the exchange graph that corresponds to clusters whose @xmath0-vector cones intersect the interior of the tits cone .    in this paper , we show how to extend the sortable / cambrian setup to obtain a complete combinatorial model when @xmath1 is acyclic and its cartan companion @xmath3 is of affine type .",
    "the basic idea can be illustrated by a very simple example .",

    "two surprising things happen .",
    "first , the cambrian fan for @xmath1 is `` compatible '' with the image under the antipodal map of the cambrian fan for @xmath2 , in the sense that the union of these two fans is again a fan ( the * _ doubled cambrian fan _ * ) .",
    "second , the doubled cambrian fan coincides with the @xmath0-vector fan , so that the dual graph to the doubled cambrian fan is isomorphic to the exchange graph .",
    "the main results of the paper are that the first of these surprising things happens for all acyclic @xmath1 and that the second happens whenever @xmath1 is acyclic and @xmath3 is of affine type . for richer examples than the rank-@xmath8 example described above ,",
    "see examples  [ affineg2 ex ] , [ affineg2 frame ex ] , [ 344 ex ] and  [ affineg2 slice ex ] .",
    "we now state our main results more formally . for each acyclic exchange matrix @xmath1",
    ", we construct a doubled cambrian fan @xmath9 as the union of the cambrian fan for @xmath1 with the antipodal cambrian fan for @xmath2 . the * _ doubled cambrian framework _ * is the pair @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dual graph to @xmath9 and @xmath12 is a certain labeling of @xmath11 by roots . in the language of @xcite ,",
    "the key result is the following .",
    "[ affinedoubleframework ] suppose that @xmath1 is acyclic and @xmath3 is of affine type .",
    "then @xmath10 is a complete , exact , well - connected , polyhedral , simply connected reflection framework .",
    "let @xmath13 be the principal - coefficients cluster algebra associated to @xmath1 .",
    "using results of @xcite ( as we explain in section  [ frame and clus sec ] ) , the following corollaries are easily obtained .",
    "[ affine exch ] if @xmath1 is acyclic and @xmath3 is of affine type , then the exchange graph of the cluster algebra @xmath13 is isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "the isomorphism sends a vertex @xmath14 of @xmath11 to a seed whose @xmath15-vectors are ( simple - root coordinates of ) @xmath16 .",
    "[ affine g ] if @xmath1 is acyclic and @xmath3 is of affine type , then @xmath9 coincides with the fan of @xmath0-vector cones for the cluster algebra @xmath13 .",
    "corollary  [ affine g ] refers to the @xmath0-vector cones defined by interpreting @xmath0-vectors as fundamental - weight coordinates of vectors in the weight lattice .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  5.17 ) and section  [ ca background sec ] of the present paper .",
    "when @xmath1 is of infinite non - affine type , the doubled cambrian fan may be a proper subfan of the @xmath0-vector fan .",
    "( see example  [ 344 ex ] . )",
    "however , the doubled cambrian fan coincides with the @xmath0-vector fan for all @xmath17 exchange matrices , even those of non - affine infinite type .",
    "( see remark  [ rank 2 ] . )",
    "one of the initial motivations for this work was to prove the affine - type case of many of the standard structural conjectures on cluster algebras .",
    "indeed , theorems about frameworks from @xcite combined with the results stated above accomplish that task .",
    "( see corollary  [ affine type conj ] . )",
    "many of the standard conjectures have been turned into theorems in full generality ( not merely the affine case ) using the machinery of scattering diagrams @xcite .",
    "see also the table at the end of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.3 ) for more on the previous status of these conjectures .",
    "the approach to cluster algebras via scattering diagrams makes it _ more _ important , not less important , to make explicit constructions in key special cases , like the affine case .",
    "scattering diagrams consist of a rational fan , decorated with certain rational functions , and containing the @xmath0-vector fan as a subfan .",
    "other constructions , notably semi - invariants ( see  @xcite for a detailed treatment of the affine case ,  @xcite for the acyclic case and  @xcite for the beginnings of an investigation of the general case ) and the mutation fan  @xcite also yield fans that contain the @xmath0-vector fan .",
    "however , none of these methods give a direct combinatorial description of the fan , and it is difficult to use them to study the regions of the fan . scattering diagrams natively construct the walls of the fan and it is difficult to use them to discuss the chambers cut out by those walls .",
    "( not impossible though !",
    "see  @xcite for some progress along these lines . )",
    "semi - invariants also naturally construct the walls , although connections have been found to cluster tilting and @xmath18-tilting modules which correspond to the regions  @xcite .",
    "neither method naturally connects the fan directly to lattice theory , although torsion classes form a lattice which has been related to semi - invariants  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our methods provide direct descriptions of the @xmath0-vector fan in the affine types in terms of the combinatorics of affine coxeter groups and root systems .",
    "we label the regions of the @xmath0-vector fan by sortable elements in those groups , which can be described either in terms of reduced words or in terms of pattern avoidance  ( @xcite ) . and our methods are built on lattice theoretic and geometric properties which are well suited for proving global properties of the fans we study .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to constructing the doubled cambrian framework and fan and proving theorem  [ affinedoubleframework ] .",
    "we begin with background in section  [ background sec ] .",
    "we define the doubled cambrian framework and fan for any acyclic exchange matrix in section  [ double sec ] , where we also prove the part of theorem  [ affinedoubleframework ] that does not need the hypothesis the @xmath3 is of affine type .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ affinedoubleframework ] is completed in section  [ affine sec ] .",
    "most of the affine dynkin diagrams are trees , and thus admit no non - acyclic orientations .",
    "the exception is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , which is an @xmath21-cycle .",
    "thus , in almost every case when @xmath3 is of affine type , @xmath1 is acyclic and the doubled cambrian framework construction provides a complete framework for @xmath1 .",
    "however , the cyclic orientation in type @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) does not fit into the doubled cambrian framework . in this case , the associated cluster algebra is of finite type @xmath22 . in  @xcite , we construct a complete framework for the cyclically oriented @xmath21-cycle using the @xmath23 root system and a variation on the doubled cambrian framework idea .",
    "in this section , we review the background material on frameworks from  @xcite .",
