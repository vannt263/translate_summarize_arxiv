    "in the last few years gene therapy has received significant attention both from the scientific community and from the general public .",
    "the development of new techniques for transferring genes into living cells allowed for the potential treatment of several diseases of genetic origin @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the central problem of gene therapy is the development of safe and efficient gene delivery system . since both the @xmath0 and the cell membranes are negatively charged , the naked polynucleotides are electrostatically prevented from entering inside cells .",
    "furthermore , the unprotected @xmath0 is rapidly degraded by nucleases present in plasma @xcite .",
    "although , much effort has concentrated on viral transfection , non - viral methods have received increased attention .",
    "this is mostly due to the possible complications which can arise from recombinant viral structures , and the consequent risk of cancer . in the non - viral category ,",
    "the @xmath1 complexes have shown the most promise .",
    "cationic liposomes can associate with the @xmath0 segments , neutralizing or even inverting the electric charge of nucleotides , thus significantly increasing the efficiency of gene adsorption and transfection by cells .",
    "in this paper we present a model of @xmath2 solutions .",
    "we find that in equilibrium , solution consists of complexes composed of dna and associated counterions and amphiphiles . as more amphiphiles",
    "are added to solution , a cooperative binding transition is found . at",
    "the transition point a large fraction of the @xmath3 charge is neutralized by the condensed surfactants . if the density of surfactant is increased beyond this point , a charge inversion of the dna becomes possible .",
    "the necessary density of amphiphile needed to reach the charge inversion is strongly dependent on the characteristic hydrophobicity of surfactant molecules . in particular",
    ", we find that for sufficiently hydrophobic amphiphiles , such as for example some cationic lipids , the charge inversion can happen at extremely low densities .",
    "our system consists of an aqueous solution of @xmath0 segments , cationic surfactants , and monovalent salt .",
    "water is modeled as a uniform medium of dielectric constant @xmath4 . in an aqueous solution ,",
    "the phosphate groups of the @xmath0 molecules become ionized resulting in a net negative charge . the salt is completely ionized , forming an equal number of cations and anions .",
    "similarly the surfactant molecules are assumed to be fully dissociated producing negative anions and polymeric chains with cationic head groups .    following the usual nomenclature , we shall call the ionized @xmath0 molecules the `` polyions '' , the positively charged ions the `` counterions '' , and the negatively charged anions the `` coions '' . to simplify the calculations ,",
    "all the counterions and coins will be treated as identical , independent of the molecules from which they were derived .",
    "the @xmath0 strands will be modeled as long rigid cylinders of length @xmath5 and diameter @xmath6 , with the charge @xmath7 distributed uniformly , with separation @xmath8 , along the major axis .",
    "the cations and anions will be depicted as hard spheres of diameter @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    "we shall also suppose that each one of the @xmath11 surfactant monomers is a rigid sphere of diameter @xmath9 with the `` head '' monomer carrying the charge @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction between the hydrophobic tails is short ranged and characterized by the hydrophobicity parameter @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath14 ) .",
    "the density of @xmath0 segments is @xmath15 , the density of monovalent salt is @xmath16 , and the density of amphiphile is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of molecules of specie @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the volume of the system .",
    "the strong electrostatic attraction between the polyions , counterions , and amphiphiles , leads to formation of complexes consisting of _ one _ polyion , @xmath21 counterions , and @xmath22 amphiphilic molecules .",
    "we shall assume that to each phosphate group of the @xmath0 molecule can be associated at most _ one _ counterion * or * @xmath23 surfactants .",
    "this assumption seems to be quite reasonable in view of the fact that the electrostatic repulsion between the counterions will prevent more than one counterion from condensing onto a given monomer . on the other hand ,",
    "the gain in hydrophobic energy resulting from the close packing of the surfactant molecules might be able to overcome the repulsive electrostatic interaction between the surfactant head groups , favoring condensation of more than one surfactant on a given monomer ( see fig .",
    "@xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 amphiphilic molecules form a `` ring '' of radius @xmath26 around the central negative monomer of the @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath27 ) .",
    "if we assume that most of the hydrocarbon chain of the associated surfactants is hidden inside the @xmath0 molecule , the maximum number of surfactants in a ring can be estimated from the excluded volume considerations , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the radius of the exclusion cylinder around a polyion .    at equilibrium , each site ( monomer ) of a polyion can be free or have one counterion _ or _ a ring of @xmath30 surfactants associated to it .",
    "we define the surface coverage of counterions as @xmath31 , and the surface coverage of surfactant rings as @xmath32 , where @xmath21 is the number of condensed counterions and @xmath33 is the number of rings containing @xmath25 surfactants .",
    "each polyion has a distribution of rings containing from one to @xmath34 surfactants .",
    "we shall neglect the polydispersity in the size of the complexes , assuming that all the complexes have @xmath21 counterions and @xmath22 amphiphilic molecules  in rings of @xmath35  with @xmath36 the total charge of each polyion is , therefore , renormalized from @xmath7 to @xmath37 , with @xmath38 @xcite-@xcite . > from overall charge neutrality , the density of free cations is @xmath39 , the density of free anions is @xmath40 , and the density of free surfactants is @xmath41 .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the limit of low surfactant densities , so as to prevent micellar formation in the bulk .",
    "the aim of the theory is to determine the characteristic values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the surface coverage by rings @xmath35 . to accomplished this ,",
    "the free energy of the @xmath42 solution will be constructed and minimized .",
    "the free energy is composed of three contributions , @xmath43 the first term is the free energy needed to form the isolated complexes . the second term accounts for the electrostatic interaction between the counterions , coions , surfactants and complexes . finally , the third term is the result of entropic mixing of various species .    to calculate the free energy required to construct an isolated complex composed of one polyion , @xmath21 condensed counterions , and @xmath22 condensed surfactants , we employ the following simplified model .",
    "each monomer of a polyion can be free or occupied by a counterion , _ or _ by @xmath44 amphiphiles ( see fig .",
    "@xmath24 ) . therefore , to each monomer @xmath19 we associate occupation variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are nonzero if that particular monomer is occupied by a condensed counterion or a ring with @xmath25 surfactants , respectively .",
    "the free energy of @xmath47 isolated complexes can then be written as @xmath48 where the sum is over all possible configurations of counterions and surfactants along a complex . for a particular configuration @xmath49",
    ", the energy can be expressed as the sum of three terms , @xmath50 .",
    "the first one is the electrostatic contribution arising from the coulombic interactions between all charged sites of a complex , @xmath51 [ - 1 + \\sigma_c(j ) + \\sum_l^{l_{max } } l \\sigma_l(j ) ] } { d |r(i)-r(j)| } \\ , , \\ ] ] where we have assumed that the only effect of association is the renormalization of the effective charge of each monomer .",
    "the second term @xmath52 , is due to hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant molecules , @xmath53 where , in order to simulate the short - ranged nature of hydrophobic interactions , the first sum is constrained to run over the nearest neighbors .",
    "the hydrophobicity parameter @xmath13 is negative , representing the tendency of the two adjacent surfactant molecules to expel water .",
    "we can estimate its value from the experimental measurement of the energy necessary to remove an amphiphile from a monolayer and place it in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the third contribution @xmath54 , accounts for the internal energy of each ring , @xmath55 @xmath56 is the interaction energy between @xmath25 surfactants forming a ring .",
    "each ring contains a maximum of @xmath34 sites , which can be occupied by surfactants . to each one of these sites we associate an occupation variable @xmath57 , which is zero",
    "if site @xmath58 is unoccupied by a surfactant and is one if it is occupied ( see fig .",
    "@xmath27 ) .",
    "the interaction energy of surfactants forming a ring can then be written as @xmath59 the first term of eq.([eq5 ] ) is due to electrostatic repulsion between the surfactant head groups , while the second is the result of attraction between the adjacent hydrocarbon tails .",
    "the exact solution of even this simpler sub - problem ( i.e. evaluation of the sum in eq.([eq1 ] ) ) is very difficult due to the long ranged electrostatic interactions .",
    "we shall , therefore , resort to mean - field theory , which works particularly well for long - ranged potentials .",

    "the third term is the free energy due to the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the surfactants forming a ring , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and the reduced temperature is @xmath69 .",
    "finally , the free energy of mixing for rings and counterions of a complex is , @xmath70 where to be consistent with the expression ( [ eq10 ] ) , we have included a contribution to the free energy arising from the azimuthal motion of condensed counterions around the polyion , _",
    "i.e. _ the last two terms of eqn.([eq11 ] ) .",
    "once a cluster , constructed in isolation , is introduced into solution , it gains an additional solvation energy due to its interaction with other clusters , free counterions , free coions , and free surfactants .",

    "the last contribution to the total free energy eq .",

    "the equilibrium configuration of the polyelectrolyte - surfactant solution is determined by the requirement that the helmholtz free energy be minimum .",
    "since @xmath85 is the function of @xmath86 , and the surface coverage by rings @xmath35 , minimization of @xmath85 implies that @xmath87 using the constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq00 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) can be separated into @xmath88 equations , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the system of equations ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) can , in principle , be solved numerically . however , for reasonable values of @xmath34 this requires a significant numerical effort . instead of pursuing this brute force method",
    ", we note that to a reasonable accuracy , the surface coverage by rings , @xmath35 , can be approximated by an exponential distribution@xcite , @xmath91 we have checked that this is , indeed , a good approximation by numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) for an isolated complex .",
    "using ansatz ( [ eq22 ] ) , the total free energy becomes a function of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath92 . for a fixed volume and number of particles",
    "the equilibrium corresponds to the minimum of helmholtz free energy , @xmath93 these are three coupled algebraic equations , which can be easily solved numerically to yield the characteristic number of condensed counterions , surfactants , as well as the shape of the distribution of ring sizes @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "4 we present a numerical solution of these equations . as a specific example we consider a cationic surfactant with an alkyl chain of @xmath95 groups . in this case",
    "the hydrophobicity parameter can be estimated @xcite to be in the range of @xmath96 . to explore the dependence of condensation on the hydrophobicity of surfactant",
    ", we shall vary this value within reason .",

    "the resulting binding isotherms are illustrated in fig . @xmath99 .",
    "the fraction of associated amphiphilic molecules @xmath100 , is plotted against the density of surfactant for a fixed amount of monovalent salt , @xmath101 . for small concentrations of cationic surfactant , few amphiphilic molecules associate with the @xmath0 segments . at the certain critical concentration , however ,",
    "the system forms _ surfoplexes _ @xcite @xcite  complexes in which the charge of the @xmath0 is almost completely neutralized by the associated amphiphiles . if the density is increased further , on average , more than one surfactant molecule will associate to each phosphate group , leading to charge inversion of the surfoplexes . for highly hydrophobic surfactants",
    "the charge inversion can happen very close to the cooperative binding transition .",
    "we note that our theory predicts the binding transition to be discontinuous , this , most likely , is an artifact of the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "we have presented a simple theory of @xmath42 solutions .",
    "our results should be of direct interest to researchers working on design of improved gene delivery systems .",
    "in particular we find that addition of cationic surfactants leads to a strong cooperative binding transition .",
    "this transition happens far bellow the critical micell concentration .",
    "a further increase of amphiphile density can result in the charge inversion of the @xmath42 complexes .",
    "this regime should be particularly useful in designing gene or oligonucleotide delivery systems . until now most of non - viral gene - delivery systems were in the form of lipoplexes  complexes formed by @xmath0 and cationic liposomes . to form the liposomes , however ,",
    "is required a significant concentration of cationic lipid .",
    "unfortunately , at high concentrations both lipids and surfactants are toxic to organism .",
