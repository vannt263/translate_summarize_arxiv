    "the _ density of states _ ( dos ) is the heart of any physical system in the sense that its structure and magnitude crucially affect all physical properties .",
    "particularly , this holds for the response of charge carriers to external stimuli such as electric or magnetic fields , temperature gradients or temperature variations , i.e. the transport properties . in disordered materials ,",
    "the random distribution of their constituents drastically affects the character of the carriers and the transport mechanisms . under certain circumstances ,",
    "the presence of disorder induces carrier localization and hopping becomes the chief transport mechanism .",
    "hence , the _ electronic wave function spatial extent _ ( @xmath0 ) , being a measure of the carrier localization , becomes a parameter of vital importance .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems have been recently considered to be among the most promising materials for nanotechnology . in particular ,",
    "an increasing amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to the electrical properties of 1d amorphous semiconductors , amorphous carbon , doped polymers , conjugated polymers and organic materials @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    given that dna has been placed among the most promising organic materials for nanotechnology , triberis  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , studied dna as a 1d disordered molecular `` wire '' in which small polarons are the charge carriers .",
    "based on the generalized molecular crystal model ( gmcm )  @xcite and theoretical percolation arguments , they studied small polaron hopping along the dna double helix and in the presence of low electric field ( @xmath1 ) . ignoring the effect of correlations , an analytical expression for the strong temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence of the electrical conductivity ( @xmath3 )",
    "was obtained which reproduced the experimental data reported for @xmath4-dna @xcite and for poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna  @xcite at high temperatures .",
    "the theoretical analysis also permitted the evaluation of the maximum hopping distance and its @xmath2-dependence , supporting the idea of multi - phonon assisted hopping of small polarons between next nearest neighbors of the dna molecular `` wire '' .",
    "taking into account the effect of correlations ( @xmath5 ) , triberis and dimakogianni  @xcite showed that @xmath6 holds for high as well as for low temperatures .",
    "this reproduced the strong @xmath7 at high temperatures reported for @xmath4-dna  @xcite and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna  @xcite , while , including correlations , the evaluation of the maximum hopping distance led to systematically longer values than those evaluated ignoring correlations  @xcite , supporting experimental evidence for long range charge migration along the dna double helix @xcite .",
    "in addition , even under moderate electric fields , strong nonlinearities of @xmath8 in 1d disordered systems have been observed . in the variable range hopping regime and at low temperatures , fogler and kelley  @xcite investigated theoretically the effect of a finite electric field on the resistivity .",
    "they took into account the existence of highly resistive segments ( breaks ) on the conducting path of the carriers in 1d systems and found that the role of the breaks diminishes and eventually becomes insignificant as @xmath1 increases .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite described hopping transport and the conductivity of 1d systems with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "investigating the @xmath2-dependence of the hopping conductivity , they showed that it increases with the increase of @xmath2 taking much larger values than in the case of the anderson model with pure diagonal disorder .",
    "they also studied the @xmath1-dependence of the conductivity to find that at low @xmath1 the hopping conductivity conforms with the ohmic law , but at strong fields it presents non - ohmic characteristics .",
    "triberis and dimakogianni  @xcite studied the @xmath9 behaviour under the influence of moderate electric fields up to @xmath10 10@xmath11 vm@xmath12 , when small polarons are transported in a disordered 1d environment , at high and low temperatures .",
    "the analytical expressions obtained for @xmath13 , were applied to experimental findings concerning charge transport in polydiacetylene quasi-1d single crystals @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at low electric fields the hopping conductivity conforms with the ohmic law while increasing the electric field the conductivity presents non - ohmic characteristics .",
    "the transition from the ohmic to the non - ohmic behaviour starts for smaller values of @xmath1 at lower temperatures and the rate of the increase of @xmath3 is greater the lower @xmath2 is .",
    "these conclusions were in a qualitative agreement with theoretical results referred to variable range hopping @xcite .",
    "dimakogianni and triberis  @xcite also investigated the effect of correlations on the non - ohmic behaviour of the small polaron hopping conductivity in 1d and 3d disordered systems .",
    "they concluded that the inclusion of correlations results to a much stronger dependence of the conductivity on the magnitude of the applied electric field compared to the uncorrelated case .",
    "the deviation of the conductivity from the ohmic behaviour appears twice as fast when correlation effects are taken into account , for a given applied electric field as the temperature increases .    in the present work , taking into account the directionality imposed by the electric field on the transport path of the carriers , we examine the role of the magnitude of the density of states and the extent of the electronic wave function and calculate @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of the present work , is to investigate @xmath9 for all reasonable @xmath2 and @xmath1 values , i.e. from 10 up to 300 k and up to the @xmath1 values where polarons cease to exist .",
    "this is done varying the density of states by orders of magnitude around values which are relevant to common 1d systems  @xcite and varying the extent of the electronic wave function from 1 to 5 @xmath14 , i.e. reasonable values for common organic molecules  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath1 plays both a _ constructive _ energetic role by offering energy for the carrier jumps and simultaneously a _ destructive _ role , in the sense that the stronger it is the more it forces the polaron to jump opposite to the @xmath15 direction prohibiting forward jumps to neighboring sites .    in section  [ sec : theory ] we present our theoretical model including the basic analytical expressions at _ high _ and _ low temperatures_. according to the mathematical analysis of the generalized molecular crystal model  @xcite , it is the condition @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) that determines the _ high _ ( _ low _ ) _ temperature _ regime .",
    "this mathematical analysis leads to the evaluation of the intrinsic transition rate , which differs at high temperatures ( multi - phonon assisted hopping ) , compared to that at low temperatures ( few - phonon assisted hopping ) . which temperature range in real systems is indeed _ high _ or _ low _ depends on the system under study .",
    "our numerical results together with the relevant discussion are staged in section  [ sec : resdis ] . in this way",
    "we examine the conductivity of small polarons in one - dimensional disordered systems , and demonstrate that the _ density of states _ and the _ spatial extent of the electronic wave function _ are two crucial factors for its behaviour . the temperature and",
    "the electric field ranges that we consider are very broad .",
    "in particular , the electric field is varied from very low up to the polaron dissociation limit ( @xmath18 vm@xmath12 ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we state our conclusions .",
    "in the context of gmcm we consider a 1d deformable `` wire '' consisting of `` molecular lattice sites '' across which small polarons are transported in the presence of disorder . by @xmath19 , and @xmath20 we denote the energies of an electron on site at vector positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , if the `` molecular lattice sites '' are constrained not to be displaced in response to the presence of the electron .",
    "due to the disorder these local electronic energies , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are not equal .",
    "the energetic non - equivalence of the two sites will affect the small polaron s binding energy , @xmath23 , in the sense that , the lower the local electronic energy is the more localized the electronic wave function will tend to be and consequently the larger its binding energy will be .",
