    "the numerical solution of einstein s field equations in three spatial dimensions in simulating for example the merging process of two neutron stars is very complicated , and only very recently have methods been developed for treating such problems in full general relativity .",
    "one of the main difficulties is encountered in the treatment of the radiation degrees of freedom . an approximation scheme developed by wilson & mathews",
    "@xcite simplifies the problem by imposing a conformally flat condition on the three metric , throwing away all radiation degrees of freedom .",
    "this reduces firstly the number of field equations and secondly reduces them to poisson like equations exclusively . in general",
    ", the first post - newtonian approximation of einstein s theory is identical to the one of the wilson - mathews scheme , and in spherical symmetry wilson - mathews is identical with einstein .    as pointed out by cook et al .",
    "@xcite , this approximation should be viable and verifiable for systems in a true equilibrium state .",
    "they investigated the accuracy of wilson & mathews approximative scheme on isolated rapidly rotating relativistic stars , and found largest errors of about 5% for any quantity analyzed .",
    "as the approximate scheme has been used in calculating the evolution of a binary system @xcite which is very far from spherical symmetry , it is desirable to have test cases , that depart stronger from spherical symmetry than rotating stars do .    here",
    "we present the model of an infinitesimally thin , pressureless disk that rotates rigidly .",
    "this problem was considered by bardeen & wagoner @xcite up to the tenth post - newtonian approximation and has been solved exactly by neugebauer & meinel @xcite .",
    "thus , it serves as an ideal test bed to check the validity of any numerical method solving the stationary , axisymmetric field equations @xcite and in particular wilson & mathews approximation scheme . to demonstrate the general accuracy of the numerical method employed we present the numerical solution of the full einstein equations as well .",
    "to describe the stationary , axisymmetric equilibrium of an infinitesimally thin disk we use a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 velocity of light ) @xmath2 where the disk is located in the equatorial plane ( z=0 ) , and the rotation axis coincides with the @xmath3-axis .      the general line element for an axisymmetric and stationary mass configuration can be written as @xcite @xmath4 ^ 2 - e^{2 \\nu } dt^2,\\ ] ] where the metric potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "as the disk has no vertical extension , the global solution of the problem may be obtained by solving the vacuum field equations , where the presence of the disk manifests itself through jump conditions in the first ( vertical ) @xmath8derivatives of the metric functions .    as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the vacuum einstein equations @xmath9 for the metric ( [ dsbw ] )",
    "are then given explicitly by @xmath10 with the @xmath11-operator in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath12 ) , and the cartesian ( in @xmath7 and @xmath3 ) laplace operator @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary conditions in the equatorial plane within the disk region @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the outer disk radius are then given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the surface density and pressure , and @xmath19 is the orbital velocity of the gas .",
    "we note that in case of a pressureless ( @xmath20 ) dust disk the metric function @xmath6 is identical to unity @xcite .",
    "radial hydrostatics yields the relation @xmath21 in the disk , where @xmath22 . in the outer part of the equatorial plane , @xmath23 , and along",
    "the polar axis symmetry conditions are used for the metric coefficients . at infinity @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "tend to zero , and @xmath26 .",
    "the method developed by wilson and mathews @xcite consists in approximating the line element ( [ dsbw ] ) by using a spatially isotropic form and neglecting the non - isotropic parts .",
    "specifically , for the problem at hand we rewrite the exact metric as @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\rho^2 \\tilde{b}^2   ( d \\varphi - \\tilde{\\omega } dt)^2       - e^{2 \\tilde{\\nu } } dt^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    by comparison with ( [ dsbw ] )",
    "we may identify @xmath32 and for the metric function @xmath29 we obtain @xmath33 applying the approximation by wilson & mathews , we neglect the non - isotropic part and set @xmath34 .",
    "simultaneously we have to omit the corresponding field equation ( for @xmath6 ) , and we obtain the approximate field equations from ( [ feld1 ] ) , ( [ feld2 ] ) , and ( [ feld4 ] ) by setting @xmath35    @xmath36    furthermore , we have to substitute for @xmath6 in the equation for the orbital velocity , and obtain @xmath37 . for our test case of a rigidly rotating dust disk ( @xmath26 ) we may summarize the exact einstein metric and the approximative wilson - mathews form as @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\        - e^{2 \\nu } dt^2,\\ ] ] and @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\        - e^{2 \\tilde{\\nu } } dt^2,\\ ] ] respectively . comparing ( [ dsein ] ) and ( [ dswil ] )",
    ", it is striking that the only difference between exact and approximate method for the dust disk example lies in the function @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath41 gives the deviation from three - dimensional conformal flatness in einstein s theory and it has been shown that in the first post - newtonian approximation @xmath41 vanishes for the dust disk solution @xcite .",
    "the field equations for the exact and the approximate case together with the boundary conditions are solved numerically for the problem of a rigidly rotating dust disk .",
    "as the numerical procedure has been described in more detail by kley @xcite we give here only a brief sketch of the method .",
    "to prevent problems with the conditions at infinity the computational domain @xmath42 $ ] is mapped onto the unit square where the radius @xmath15 of the disk is located at @xmath43 .",
    "this domain is covered here by @xmath44 gridcells and the partial differential equations are discretized to second order spatial accuracy on this grid yielding a coupled system of equations .",
    "together with the boundary jump conditions these equations are then solved iteratively until convergence has been achieved .",
    "the accuracy of the solutions may be estimated using the analytical solution @xcite and post - newtonian approximation @xcite of the dust disk .",
    "to give an idea of the degree of non - isotropy of the three metric for the exact einsteinian disk we display in figure 1 the behaviour of the function @xmath45 within the disk for different values of the central redshift .",
    "in the figure the numerically obtained solution of the field equations ( [ feld1])-([feld4 ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ bound1])-([bound4 ] ) is compared to the exact solution as given by @xcite .",
    "the errors over the whole disk for all central redshifts are usually well below 1% and only at the outer edge of the disk the worst deviation is about 2% for @xmath46 .",
    "this demonstrates the accuracy of the numerical method employed , even for the moderate gridsize used .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 8.0 cm    we compared the numerically obtained approximate metric coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 versus radius with the exact solution and find that in case of the `` lapse '' potential @xmath47 the deviation from the exact case is always below 2.5% , even for central redshifts as large as 3 . for the function",
    "@xmath48 the deviation is larger , 2.3% for @xmath49 , 5.5% for @xmath50 , and about 20% for @xmath46 .",
    "the results for the metric function @xmath25 are displayed in fig .",
    "the errors are very large for higher redshifts , about 9% for @xmath51 and up to 48% for @xmath46 . the approximate solution ( crosses )",
    "shows also the wrong trend of the evolution of @xmath25 with redshift . while in the einsteinian disk case @xmath25 increases first with redshift , and then decreases for @xmath52 , in the approximative solution @xmath25 seems to increase steadily with @xmath3 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the overall deviations of the metric functions from the exact case may be understood qualitatively by looking at the line elements ( [ dsein ] ) and ( [ dswil ] ) . as the lapse is not too much affected by the simplification in the spatial three metric",
    "it will be calculated quite accurately in the wilson - mathews approach .",
    "the rotational coefficient @xmath25 is affected mostly and hence shows the largest errors .",
    "we may nevertheless infer that at least for central redshifts up to @xmath49 the approximate solution is very accurate , but for higher relativistic disks the agreement deteriorates .",
    "note , that @xmath53 was the maximum ( polar ) redshift tested in the comparison for rotating stars by cook et al .",
    "@xcite .    as a further illustration of the range of applicability of the wilson - mathews approximation , it is interesting to plot global quantities . in fig .  3 we display the dependence of the dimensionless quantity @xmath54 versus the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "one notices again the very good agreement of the numerical and exact solution of the full einstein equations .",
    "interestingly , the post - newtonian approximations approach the exact solution from below while the wilson - mathews approximation lies always above the exact solution . in case of the full einsteinian disk for infinite central redshift",
    "@xmath56 reaches a finite maximum of about @xmath57 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 8.0 cm    in fig .",
    "4 the normalized binding energy @xmath58 is plotted versus @xmath54 . for a given rest mass @xmath59 and angular rotation rate @xmath60 the wilson - mathews approximation yields a lower binding energy for the dust disk than the einstein disk",
    "the dotted line for the post - newtonian solution ends at @xmath61 because this refers already to @xmath62 ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) .    finally , in figure 5 the dimensionless rotation rate @xmath63 is plotted versus the dimensionless total angular momentum @xmath64 , parameters that are measurable at infinity .",
    "the value @xmath65 corresponds to the extreme kerr limit of the dust disk solution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "again , the wilson - mathews approximation lies beyond the post - newtonian approximation and does not yield the correct black hole limit .",
    "we have calculated numerically model sequences of a rigidly rotating disk of dust using a ) the full einstein equations and b ) the modified wilson - mathews scheme . by comparing those to the known exact solution by neugebauer & meinel @xcite , we have shown that the wilson - mathews approximation yields results which are accurate to about 5% if the central redshift of the disk is smaller than 0.5 ; but may be significantly higher for stronger relativistic models .",
    "we conclude that the wilson - mathews approach for solving the einstein equations yields results which are at most as accurate as the first post - newtonian approximation , at least for rigidly rotating disks of dust . hence , its application to stronger relativistic configurations e.g. in close , compact binary systems has to be handled with caution .",
