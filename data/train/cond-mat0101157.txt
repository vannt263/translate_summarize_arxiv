    "which  path devices such as the canonical two  slit interference experiment , where a measurement is made of the path a particle takes , have a long history going back as far as the early debates about complementarity.@xcite recent interest in their investigation has been stimulated partly by advances in experimental techniques , which have lead to the realization of several different varieties of which  path systems in the laboratory,@xcite and partly by accompanying developments in the theory of quantum measurement.@xcite however , it is the realization that a which  path experiment provides a very convenient model system for developing and testing fundamental ideas about decoherence in mesoscopic systems,@xcite that has increased the level of interest within the solid state physics community in particular .    which  path experiments in solid state systems were recently pioneered by buks _ et al._@xcite the solid state analog of the two  slit interference experiment is the measurement of the oscillations in the current passing through an aharonov  bohm ( ab ) ring as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the path taken by an electron may be probed by placing a measuring device close to one of the arms .",
    "incorporated a quantum dot in one of the arms in order to slow the electrons down , with a neighboring quantum point contact ( qpc ) serving as a which  path detector .",
    "an electron travelling around the arm of the ring containing the dot dwells on the dot for a finite amount of time before moving on .",
    "the presence of the dot alone does not destroy the coherence of the electron transport through the ring , so long as the dwell time of the electrons is sufficiently short,@xcite but it does provide time for the electron to interact with an external measuring device .",
    "a qpc adjacent to the dot functions as a measuring device since it can be biased so that its conductance is very sensitive to changes in the occupancy of the dot : the passage of an electron via the path including the dot leaves behind which  path information in the qpc device , although actual knowledge of which path an electron took , so  called ` true which  path information ' , can only be obtained via further measurement.@xcite in accord with theoretical predictions,@xcite the experiment demonstrated that the interference fringes are degraded when the interaction between the electrons and the measuring device is sufficiently sensitive for information to be obtained that would help , even in principle , to determine which of the two possible paths an electron took .    the experiment of buks _ et al .",
    "_ has close parallels with the well  known thought experiment ( see , e.g. , sec . 1 - 6 of ref .   ) , in which a light source is used to detect through which slit an electron passes in a two  slit interference experiment . in both cases dephasing is effected by scatterers , each of which interact once , and once only , with the interfering particle and whose interactions with each other may safely be ignored . for the electron ",
    "light scattering scheme,@xcite the scatterers are photons which probe the electron s state directly , whereas in the solid  state experiment the scatterers are electrons in the qpc which interact with the electron on the dot via electrostatic coupling . however , because the electron has a finite dwell time on the dot , it has time to interact with more than one scatterer in the qpc , so that in this case dephasing can be achieved via a series of very weak interactions rather than a single strong event , as is the case in the photon thought experiment .",
    "the present work is concerned with a variation on the system considered by buks _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "in which a radio frequency mechanical cantilever is used , rather than a qpc , to determine which path an electron takes .",
    "a coupling between electrons residing on the dot ( which is again on one of the ab interferometer arms ) and the cantilever , whose tip is suspended over the dot , can be set up by developing a uniform electric field between the tip of the cantilever and the base of the dot .",
    "electrons on the dot couple approximately linearly to the cantilever position , thus leading to a coupling between the flexural phonon modes of the cantilever and the occupancy of the dot .",
    "furthermore , because the coupling strength decays rapidly with increasing frequency and also the flexural mode spectrum of a cantilever is quite sparse , it turns out that for micron scale cantilevers only the fundamental flexural mode is relevant .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures the cantilever can be treated as a single quantum mechanical oscillator .    as a consequence of the cantilever having effectively only one degree of freedom , the electromechanical which  path interferometer exhibits qualitatively different behavior from the qpc which  path device . in particular , we find that the dephasing behavior of the electron due to the cantilever depends on the relative magnitudes of the electron dwell time on the dot and the cantilever period . when the dwell time is short compared to the cantilever period , the dephasing occurs in a way analogous to einstein s recoiling slit thought ",
    "experiment.@xcite in contrast , when the dwell time of the electron on the dot is comparable to or longer than the period of the cantilever , a description of the dephasing in terms of the entanglement of the cantilever and electron states becomes more appropriate than a semiclassical picture of momentum transfer .",
    "the effectively harmonic nature of the cantilever motion means that the degree of entanglement between the cantilever and electronic states must be periodic , so long as the cantilever interacts only with the electron on the dot .",
    "if the dwell time of the electrons on the dot could be tuned to the cantilever period , then we would be able to erase all which  path information held in the state of the cantilever .",
    "this would give us direct evidence that the coupled cantilever and dot were behaving as a single coherent quantum system .",
    "however , in practice electron dwell times on a quantum dot have a distribution of values and so we can only obtain indirect evidence for the quantum coherence of the cantilever  dot system , such as the coherent exchange of energy quanta between the electron and the cantilever which give rise to side resonances in the elastic transmission amplitude of the device .",
    "the environment of the cantilever influences its behavior in two important ways : over short timescales it destroys the cantilever s phase coherence , whilst over longer timescales it damps the cantilever s motion .",
    "the electromechanical which  path system we propose acts as a probe of the cantilever s decoherence due to it s interaction with the environment .",
    "we show that the cantilever s decoherence inhibits the coherent exchange of energy between the cantilever and the dot and hence manifests itself by washing out the side resonances in the elastic transmission amplitude .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give our basic model for the electromechanical which  path device and show that the interference properties of the ab ring , modified to include the dot and cantilever , can be obtained by calculating the elastic transmission amplitude of the arm containing the dot . in sec .",
    "iii we describe a simple tight  binding model for an electron on a dot which is linearly coupled to the cantilever ( treated as a quantum oscillator ) and to propagating states in the leads .",
    "we show that recent work on inelastic resonant tunneling can be adapted to obtain the elastic transmission amplitude .",
    "we present results for our model in sec .",
    "iv , where we examine dephasing as a function of the dot  cantilever coupling in both the regime where the electron dwell time is short compared to the cantilever period and where they are comparable .    in sec .",
    "v we examine the influence of the cantilever s environment on the dephasing produced by the cantilever when the dwell time is comparable to the period of the cantilever . we obtain a modified expression for the transmission through the arm with the dot when the cantilever is coupled to an environment which consists of a bath of oscillators .    in sec .",
    "vi we outline the principal practical constraints on an electromechanical which  path device and discuss its feasibility using currently available technology .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "vii and discuss ways in which the present work could be extended .",
    "appendix a contains a detailed , classical analysis of the cantilever  dot coupling and the flexural mode spectrum of the cantilever which underpin the simplified model employed in the main text .",
    "finally , appendix b contains details of a general calculation of the effect of the cantilever environment on the transmission amplitude of the dot .",
    "the ultimate goal of our analysis of the electromechanical which  path device is to obtain an expression for how the magnetoresistance of the ab ring varies as a function of the coupling between the cantilever and an electron on the dot . in particular , we want to determine how the amplitude and phase of the oscillation in the current through the device as the magnetic field is varied ( i.e. , the interference fringes ) depend on the voltage between the cantilever and the dot . in order to simplify the analysis , we will consider only the case where the magnetoresistance is measured as an average over a time much longer than any other timescale in the problem .",
    "our model builds on the theoretical analysis of the qpc which  path experiment , carried out by a number of groups.@xcite however , there are also close parallels between the system we consider and a quantum optical system analyzed recently,@xcite in which radiation is used to drive an oscillator  mounted mirror into non  classical states .    since we are interested in the behavior of the system averaged over time , it is sufficient to work within the landauer framework , so that our task of obtaining the average magnetoresistance is equivalent to calculating the transmission characteristics of the device.@xcite the simplest way of thinking about the transmission probability through the ab ring is in terms of a two  slit experiment : the total transmission probability , @xmath0 , is given by the coherent sum of amplitudes for transmission through the left and right arms , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 this approach was employed by yacoby _",
    "et al._@xcite in their analysis of the first experiments on ab rings with a quantum dot included in one arm .",
    "however , in that case this simple formalism proved inadequate as it neglects the contribution of electrons which have undergone multiple reflections .",
    "the contribution to the transmission of multiply reflected electrons leads to the enforcement of the onsager ",
    "type relation for the conductance from source ( s ) to drain ( d ) : @xmath4 , which must apply for a two ",
    "terminal device.@xcite if the ab ring is modified to absorb electrons which are scattered backwards in the device , then the onsager ",
    "type condition is no longer satisfied and the simple  minded formula ( [ sm ] ) is valid .",
    "_ incorporated just such a modification in their ab ring and we shall limit our analysis to this case .",
    "we write @xmath5 for the transmission through the arm containing the dot and @xmath6 for the other amplitude .",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux , @xmath7 , induces an additional relative phase shift between the two paths and so the transmission probability in the absence of the cantilever can be written as @xmath8 , \\label{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the flux quantum and @xmath10 is the flux independent term of the transmission probability . in practice ,",
    "the transmission through the arm with the dot is much less than that through the arm without the dot , @xmath11 , and so @xmath12 .    when there is a non ",
    "zero interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the dot , we must explicitly include the fact that the transmission depends on the initial state of the cantilever . since the cantilever contains a macroscopic number of atoms we assume that its initial state can always be described as a thermal mixture .",
    "such a procedure will necessarily lead us to neglect short time correlations between the cantilever states , but this will be unimportant if the magnetoresistance is averaged over a time which is long compared with the characteristic timescale for the thermalization of the cantilever s motion.@xcite with the initial state of the cantilever assumed to be thermal we have , @xmath13 , \\label{t2}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is an operator on cantilever states only , @xmath15 is the usual thermal weight ( @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the energy of the state ) , and we have made no assumption about the final state of the cantilever mode . because only the dot arm interacts with the cantilever the interference term is diagonal in the cantilever modes , @xmath19= 2{\\mathrm{re}}\\left[t^*_0\\langle\\tilde{t}_{\\mathrm qd}\\rangle    { \\mathrm{e}}^{i 2\\pi\\phi/\\phi_0}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is averaged over the cantilever thermal state .",
    "thus , only elastic scattering processes contribute to the interference term .    at finite temperatures we also have to average the transmission amplitude for transport through the arm containing the dot over the fermi distribution:@xcite @xmath21",
    "the knowledge of the transmission amplitude allows us to obtain the amplitude of the periodic oscillations in the current , or in the language of a generic two ",
    "slit experiment , the visibility of the interference fringes .",
    "the visibility , @xmath22 , in a two  slit experiment is defined in terms of the maximum and minimum signal ( in this case current ) , measured at the peaks and valleys of the fringes , respectively:@xcite @xmath23    in the case of the electromechanical which  path device considered here , the current is proportional to the transmission probability , @xmath0 , given in eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) above .",
    "we can write the transmission amplitudes through the two arms in modulus ",
    "argument form , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that the interference part of the transmission probability takes the form @xmath26 = 2|{t}_0||\\langle\\tilde{t}_{\\mathrm qd}\\rangle|\\cos\\left ( 2\\pi\\phi/\\phi_0 + \\alpha-\\beta   \\right).\\ ] ] hence in this case , the visibility of the fringes is @xmath27 the phase of the transmission amplitude determines the phase of the fringe pattern as a function of the magnetic field . any change in the phase of the transmission amplitude should therefore be detectable as a change in the phase of the whole interference pattern .    in the absence of the dot , and for the ideal case of a ring",
    "in which both arms are identical , the transmission amplitudes for both arms are the same so that @xmath28 and the visibility is unity .",
    "this demonstrates the utility of @xmath22 as a measure : it does not depend on the value of the total transmission probability through the device , but just on its interferometric properties .    in practice",
    ", a fringe visibility close to unity can not be achieved .",
    "apart from the obvious difficulty in constructing a ring in which both arms are identical ,",
    "there are two further reasons why the ` intrinsic ' visibility is less than unity.@xcite firstly , there is more than one conduction channel in each arm and so the transport is never really a ` one electron ' problem .",
    "secondly , thermal smearing can play an important rle , since the thermal smearing length is typically comparable to the size of the ring at temperatures of around 100mk.@xcite however , for our device the reduction in fringe visibility arising from sources other than the cantilever is irrelevant : all we require is that there should be a measurable change in the visibility of the fringes as the electric field coupling the dot and cantilever is turned on .",
    "in order to obtain the transmission amplitude for the arm of the ab ring containing the dot , we employ a standard tight  binding model for the dot and the leads to which it is coupled . in the coulomb blockade regime , the quantum dot is modelled by a single localised state , at energy @xmath29 , which is coupled to sets of non  interacting , propagating , states in the leads .",
    "the cantilever is treated as a single quantum oscillator mode of frequency @xmath30 , although the generalisation to include a spectrum of modes is straightforward , as we discuss below .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the interferometer arm can be written as the sum of two parts @xmath31 with non  interacting part @xmath32 and interacting part @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 operate on the states of the electron on the dot and the cantilever , respectively .",
    "the states in the left  hand(right  hand ) leads have energies @xmath36(@xmath37 ) and are operated on by @xmath38(@xmath39 ) , where the index @xmath40 runs over propagating states in the leads .",
    "the matrix elements for hopping onto(off ) the dot are given by @xmath41(@xmath42 ) .",
    "the interaction between the electron on the dot and the cantilever is modelled as a linear coupling between the displacement of the flexural mode and the occupation of the dot , since when the electron is not on the dot there is no displacement of the cantilever.@xcite we analyze the interaction between the cantilever and the dot in some detail in appendix a , where the form of the interaction is derived in terms of the normal modes of the cantilever .",
    "we find that the coupling constant , @xmath43 , is given by the relation @xmath44 [ see eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) ] , where @xmath45 is a geometrical factor of order one , @xmath46 is the electric field experienced by the additional electron on the dot , @xmath47 is the cantilever mass and @xmath48 the electronic charge .",
    "the energy - dependent amplitude , @xmath49 , is calculated using the usual @xmath50matrix formalism@xcite employed in transport theory .",
    "the amplitude for transmission from a state of energy @xmath51 to one of energy @xmath52 is given by the element of the @xmath50matrix@xcite linking propagating states in the left and right  hand leads @xmath53 where @xmath54(@xmath55 ) is the state in the right(left)hand lead with energy @xmath52(@xmath51 ) . the total transmission amplitude at energy @xmath51 is then obtained by integrating over the final state energies @xmath56    the @xmath50matrix element for a single electron tunneling from left to right through a single , localised , state which is coupled to a cantilever mode can be calculated using either the methods described by wingreen _",
    "@xcite or those of glazman and shekhter.@xcite for initial and final states of the cantilever given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , the relevant matrix element is @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the usual small positive real number inserted to ensure convergence .",
    "we want to calculate the visibility of the fringes and so we need only calculate the coherent part of the transmission probability , and hence the elastic transmission amplitude . to evaluate the elastic transmission amplitude we consider processes",
    "in which the state of the cantilever remains unchanged and so we write @xmath61 and calculate an average over an ensemble of states of the cantilever ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "ii above ) .",
    "thus @xmath62 with @xmath63 and where @xmath64 is the state with no electrons on the localised level and the cantilever in state @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that the coupling to the leads is independent of energy over the range of interest and that it is symmetric so that we can write @xmath66 since we are considering only the elastic part of the transmission amplitude the green function will be invariant with respect to time .",
    "hence , we change variables to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so that the green function takes the form @xmath69 and the invariance with respect to translations in time is equivalent to the statement that the value of the green function is independent of the choice of @xmath6 . averaging over @xmath6 , and taking the limit @xmath70 , the overall expression for the @xmath50matrix element is then @xmath71    thus , the final expression for the transmission amplitude of the dot is @xmath72 where the transmission amplitude is understood to be time ",
    "averaged in the sense described in sec .",
    "ii , and the relevant green function is @xmath73 where the expectation value is over a thermal distribution state of the cantilever with no electrons present .",
    "this result for the transmission amplitude is very similar to that studied by aleiner _",
    "et al._,@xcite in their analysis of the qpc which  path device .",
    "the green function can be evaluated using either operator algebra techniques,@xcite or many body perturbation theory,@xcite and one obtains @xmath74 where @xmath75 and it has been assumed that the renormalisation of the dot energy , @xmath29 , due to coupling to the leads can be ignored .",
    "the factor due to coupling to the cantilever , @xmath76 , can be obtained by calculating the contribution for the cantilever beginning and ending in a particular coherent state , @xmath77 , and then carrying out a thermal average over all coherent states with appropriate weightings , @xmath78 } { \\mathrm{e}}^{-(\\lambda/\\hbar\\omega_0)^2[1-\\cos(\\omega_0\\tau ) ] } \\int\\frac{{d}^2\\nu}{\\pi\\overline{n}}{\\mathrm{e}}^ { ( \\lambda/\\hbar\\omega_0)(\\nu^*\\mu-\\nu\\mu^*)}{\\mathrm{e } } ^{-|\\nu|^2/\\overline{n}},\\label{ephi}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 . evaluating the thermal average , we find @xmath80+[1-\\cos(\\omega_0 \\tau)](1 + 2\\overline{n})\\right\\ } ,   \\label{ex2}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 the thermal occupation of the cantilever mode .",
    "it is clear that the thermal average leads to a much more rapidly decaying term , due to the extra factor of @xmath82 .",
    "if the cantilever remained in a coherent state throughout then it would be far less effective , compared to the thermal state , at reducing the visibility of the fringes .",
    "this is because each coherent state affects the transmission amplitude in two different ways : the magnitude of the transmission is reduced by an amount which is independent of which state the cantilever is in and also a phase shift is induced whose size depends sensitively on the cantilever state .",
    "when we carry out the thermal average we are in effect averaging over a range of different phase shifts .",
    "such a procedure effectively destroys the interference fringes whenever the thermal state includes contributions in which the phase differs by @xmath83 , irrespective of the magnitude of the transmission amplitude for each of the coherent states which constitute the thermal mixture .",
    "the thermal averaging timescale is given by the damping time of the cantilever which will typically be much larger than the dwell time of the electron on the dot .",
    "in this case , the loss of fringe visibility arising from thermal smearing is not due to which  path detection of individual electrons : a measurement of the current averaged over times shorter than the damping time but longer than the dwell time would resolve ab fringes with phase fluctuating in time .",
    "in contrast , the state - independent reduction in the transmission amplitude would give rise to a reduction in the fringe visibility even for the time - resolved measurement , signifying which  path detection .",
    "however , since we are working in a steady state regime in which we consider measurements made over very long times we will not be able to make an explicit distinction between which",
    " path detection and thermal smearing in this work .",
    "we can repeat this calculation for the more general case of coupling to a whole series of non - interacting cantilever modes .",
    "the result has the same basic structure as before , but the cantilever factor , @xmath76 , is modified and now takes the form of a sum of the contributions from each mode,@xcite @xmath84,\\label{phinoenv}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the coupling constant , frequency , and thermal occupation number of the @xmath88th cantilever mode , respectively .",
    "however , we find that for the purposes of demonstrating the electromechanical which  path device we need only consider a single mode , as is discussed in appendix a.",
    "the important question which we need to answer is the following : when does the cantilever destroy the ab fringes ? there are two very different regimes which we can explore by varying the relative sizes of characteristic dwell time of the electron on the dot , @xmath89 , and the fundamental frequency of the cantilever :    1 .",
    "@xmath90 : in this case the periodic behavior of the cantilever will not be relevant and the entanglement built up between the cantilever and electron states during the dwell time will be irreversible , leading to dephasing .",
    "2 .   @xmath91 : in this regime the periodicity of the cantilever means that the entanglement of the cantilever and dot states caused by their interaction may be partially undone , or erased , although the distribution of electron dwell times will make the effect impossible to observe directly .    the first regime is easier to analyze theoretically , as the calculations can be done analytically and invite direct comparisons with the sliding  slit thought experiment .",
    "the case where the dwell time of the electron on the dot is comparable to the period of the cantilever has to be analyzed numerically .",
    "it is also complicated by the presence of the cantilever s environment which makes the entanglement of the cantilever and dot states irreversible by breaking the overall periodicity in the expression ( [ tqd ] ) for the transmission amplitude . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the magnitude and phase of the transmission amplitude in both regimes , neglecting the effect of the environment which we address in detail in sec . v.",
    "this approach enables a clear picture to be built up of exactly how the environment affects the behavior of the cantilever  dot system .",
    "since @xmath90 , we can simplify eq.([tqd ] ) for the transmission amplitude through the arm with the dot by expanding the harmonic functions to quadratic order in @xmath92 .",
    "we obtain @xmath93\\tau/\\hbar -(ee\\delta x_{\\mathrm th}\\tau)^2/2\\hbar^2 } , \\label{exp}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the thermal position uncertainty of the cantilever and we have taken the geometrical factor in the coupling constant ( [ coupling ] ) to be unity for simplicity .",
    "the integral on the righthand side can now be evaluated to obtain @xmath95 ^ 2 } { 2(ee\\delta { x_{\\mathrm th}})^2}\\right){\\mathrm{erfc } } \\left(\\frac{\\gamma/2-i(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_0)}{\\sqrt{2 } ee\\delta x_{\\mathrm th } } \\right).\\ ] ]    if we ignore , for the moment , the thermal width of the electron energy distribution in the leads , then we can deduce from this expression a rough criterion for dephasing in the region close to the electronic resonance : @xmath96 or written in another way , @xmath97 practical considerations ( see sec .",
    "vi ) restrict the dwell time to be a few ns or less and place an upper bound on the electric field : @xmath98v / m .",
    "thus , the destruction of the interference fringes requires @xmath99 , a value which is certainly achievable .",
    "as previously discussed , the loss of fringe visibility is not only associated with which  path detection , but with thermal smearing as well .",
    "we can obtain the condition for which  path detection by setting the cantilever temperature to zero in eq .",
    "( [ dephasecond2 ] ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the zero - point position uncertainty . because the reduction in the transmission amplitude due to each different coherent state is the same [ c.f . , eq . ( [ ephi ] ) ] , this condition holds independently of which coherent state the cantilever is in .",
    "thus , we find that for which  path detection to occur the classical impulse delivered to the cantilever during the dwell time must exceed twice the zero  point momentum uncertainty of the cantilever .",
    "our result is equivalent to that obtained by bohr in his famous discussion of einstein s sliding  slit _ gedanken _ experiment.@xcite in that case bohr argued that in order to detect the passage of an electron through a given slit , the momentum uncertainty in the slit must be less than the impulse transferred by the passing electron , thus necessitating a corresponding latitude in position of the slits ( via the uncertainty principle ) which in turn washes out the fringes by causing large phase shifts ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) for successive electrons .",
    "however , these phase shifts are not associated with any kind of thermal fluctuation , instead they arise from the position uncertainty of the quantum state of the slits .    at finite temperatures we must take into account not only the thermal state of the cantilever , but also the fact that the electron energies are spread over a range @xmath102 around the fermi energy",
    "we must therefore average the transmission amplitude over energy , weighted by the derivative of the fermi distribution function [ see eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) ] : @xmath103 where we have assumed that the bias across the device is small enough for a linear response approach to be valid and that the average fermi energy in the leads is tuned to the resonance @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of this procedure is to reduce both the coherent transmission amplitude itself and the influence the cantilever has on it .",
    "the explanation for this unexpected feature can be found by comparing the transmission amplitude , @xmath104 , at and away from the resonance .",
    "whilst the transmission amplitude at , or close to , resonance decays rapidly with increasing coupling to the cantilever , the situation is reversed when the electron energy is far from resonance , where the transmission amplitude is _ enhanced _ by the interaction with the cantilever .",
    "the reduction in dephasing efficiency due to the thermal averaging over the electron energy distribution makes an interesting contrast to the effect of the thermal average over cantilever states , which increases the dephasing rate substantially .",
    "1 illustrates the effect of increasing the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath105 on the magnitude of the resonant transmission amplitude @xmath106 , with and without averaging over the thermal width of the electron energy distribution in the leads .",
    "for this example , we have taken @xmath107  mhz and @xmath10820  mk ( giving a thermal occupation @xmath109 ) , @xmath110  kg , and assumed @xmath111 to have a maximum value of about 3 , consistent with the analysis of the cantilever  dot coupling in appendix a. the effect of the thermal broadening of electron energies in reducing the efficiency of the cantilever to cause dephasing is clear .",
    "it is important to note that our treatment is entirely restricted to a one  electron picture of transport .",
    "such an approach is valid so long as the electron gas in the leads and the dot itself is non - degenerate . when the electron temperature drops towards zero the interactions between electrons can no longer be ignored and so our model and the results which follow from it become inapplicable . at @xmath112 and in the weak bias limit , inelastic transport through the dot would become impossible : with the absence of unoccupied states below the fermi level and the cantilever in the ground state an electron is unable to exchange energy quanta with the cantilever .      in the regime where the dwell time of the electron on the dot approaches the period of the cantilever , the system takes on a rather different character , as the dephasing interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the dot is no longer a brief scattering event , but a sustained interaction . in this regime",
    "we would expect to see evidence of the periodic behavior of the cantilever , such as side resonances in the elastic transmission amplitude , but in practice these would have to compete with thermal effects which tend to wash out fine structure in the transmission characteristics .    in order to calculate the transmission amplitude , it is convenient to recast our earlier expression ( [ tqd ] ) in the form @xmath113 } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\int_0^{2\\pi}{d}\\tau ' \\exp\\biggl\\{\\frac{-\\tau'}{\\omega_0}\\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\left(\\epsilon_0-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\hbar\\omega_0}-\\epsilon \\right ) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\hbar }   \\right]\\nonumber \\\\         & & -i\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar\\omega_0}\\right)^2 \\sin ( \\tau ' ) + ( 2\\overline{n}+1)\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar\\omega_0}\\right)^2   \\cos ( \\tau')\\biggr\\},\\label{calc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 .",
    "of course , to model a practical experiment , we also need to average over the energy , @xmath51 , to take into account the effect of electron temperature . however , we look first at the dependence of the transmission amplitude on the incident energy .",
    "although this would require ` monochromatic ' electrons , important insight is gained into the behavior of the system which in practice may be obscured by thermal effects .    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the magnitude of the resonant transmission amplitude is plotted against the coupling @xmath111 for @xmath115=2 , 1 , and 0.5 , and with @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior is similar in all three cases for small @xmath111 , with a rapid decay in the magnitude of the transmission amplitude , due to dephasing caused by a combination of which  path detection and thermal fluctuations in the state of the cantilever .",

    "side resonances are a familiar feature in tunneling problems , but unlike those found here they are usually associated with inelastic processes . however , as was first shown by jauho and wingreen,@xcite who considered the classical  oscillator version of the problem we address , such resonances can also occur in the elastic transmission amplitude .",
    "side resonances in the elastic transmission indicate coherent or virtual exchange of energy quanta between the electron on the dot and the cantilever , with no net energy interchange over the dwell time of the electron . in a fully quantum mechanical system",
    ", these processes must rely on the coupled cantilever  electron system maintaining its phase coherency and so we may expect that the influence on the cantilever of its environment should be detectable , at least in principle , via its effect on these resonances .",

    "note , in the case of photon assisted tunneling the photon energy can be made comparable with @xmath128 without difficulty.@xcite",
    "thus far , we have treated the cantilever  dot system as isolated , thereby ignoring the effect of the environment on their degrees of freedom .",
    "this approximation is valid when the dwell time of the electron on the dot is short compared to the decoherence time of the cantilever , as will most certainly be the case for @xmath90 .",

    "indeed , we would like to know how the environment of the cantilever affects the coherent oscillations which occur in the transmission amplitude as a function of the coupling strength ( for monochromatic electrons ) .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the decoherence arising from the cantilever s environment should wash out the side resonances in the transmission amplitude , but a detailed calculation is required to determine the cantilever quality ( @xmath130 ) factor range for this to occur .    in general , both the interaction between the dot electron and its local environment ( other electrons , phonons , photons , etc . in the dot region ) and the interaction between the cantilever and its environment ( the other collective vibrational modes , as well as internal electronic degrees of freedom , external photons , gas molecules , etc . ) will contribute to the decoherence .",
    "however , since we can always measure the properties of the fringes with the dot  cantilever interaction turned off for an arbitrary dwell time ( @xmath89 ) , we need only consider the additional effect of the cantilever s environment , as the electron s environment can be included via a renormalisation of the zero electric field transmission amplitude .",
    "we can obtain a rough estimate of the time ",

    "however , this need not be the case and certainly would not be appropriate for the system we are considering . in order to specify the model completely we need to give the expectation values at @xmath164 for both the cantilever and the bath . if we set the initial expectation values of the cantilever to be those of a thermal state at the same temperature as the bath , then we can describe the case in which the cantilever has been interacting with the bath for a time much longer than the damping time , @xmath165 , _ before _ @xmath164 and so is in equilibrium with the bath .",

    "the frequency range of the cantilever is crucial for observing quantum coherent behavior such as side resonances , as well as their destruction due to decoherence",
    ". the lower limit on the frequency range is set by the requirement that the cantilever period should be comparable to the dwell time @xmath89 of the electron on the quantum dot , while the upper limit is set by the requirement that the interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the dot be sufficiently strong , given the limits on the electric field , to lead to decoherence , again on a time ",
    "scale comparable to the dwell time .",
    "the interaction between the electron on the dot and the cantilever is discussed in more detail in appendix a , along with the geometrical factors which arise in the calculation of the effect of the electric field on the flexural cantilever modes . the dwell time is limited by the rate at which processes other than the interaction with the cantilever cause decoherence , as well as how small a current can be measured through the dot .",
    "of course , the decoherence rate of all the background processes is very difficult to estimate theoretically ; in experiment it can be done by observing the visibility of the fringes as a function of dwell time with the cantilever interaction switched off .",
    "this then provides a baseline with which to compare all later measurements where we are interested in the effect of the cantilever .",
    "previous experiments carried out at @xmath204  k by yacoby _",
    "et al._,@xcite which were designed to measure the phase of the transmission amplitude through a dot in the absence of any external probe , show that dwell times as long 10  ns and currents as low as @xmath205  a lead to fringes which are still detectable .",
    "it turns out that the best compromise between the two competing frequency limits is achieved by using say a carbon nanotube cantilever with a frequency of 100200  mhz , giving a maximum coupling @xmath206 ( appendix a ) .",
    "the problem is not so much in finding a cantilever with a high enough frequency , but rather in obtaining a large enough coupling from the electric field to cause a detectable amount of dephasing .    in the light of these practical constraints",
    "it is clear that only some of the theoretical results obtained in our analysis would be observable in an experiment using current technology .",
    "the overall destruction of the ab interference fringes as the coupling between the cantilever and the electron on the dot is increased should be detectable , both in the regime where @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "however , the restrictions on the temperature and cantilever frequency imply that an experiment would have to be performed in the regime where @xmath209 .",
    "this means that the thermal width of electron energies will wash out the side resonances in the transmission which were found to occur when @xmath208 . under these circumstances , the effect of the cantilever s environment on the transmission characteristics would be obscured .",
    "however , we emphasise again that these limitations are not fundamental : if the width of the electron energies could be reduced or if the restriction on the maximum cantilever frequency could be relaxed ( by finding a way to increase the coupling between the electron on the dot and the cantilever , for example ) then the coherent , quantum electromechanical features which our analysis predicts should be observable . whilst it is not clear how the coupling constant between the cantilever and the dot could be increased , it is possible to reduce the thermal width of electron energies by using a double quantum dot system rather than a single one as we have considered here.@xcite    it is also possible to conduct experiments in which an ac bias is applied to the ab ring .",
    "such an experiment would provide an alternative way of investigating the interaction between the cantilever and its environment : if the ac frequency is higher than the rate @xmath210 at which the cantilever state changes due to thermal fluctuations then the thermally - induced fluctuations in the phase of the interference fringes should be detectable , and distinguishable from the destruction of the interference fringes due to which - path detection .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of such an experiment requires extending the theory developed here to include time dependence , and so goes well beyond the present analysis .",
    "we have carried out a theoretical analysis of a possible solid state which  path interferometer , in which electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom become coupled .",
    "the visibility and phase of the interference fringes in the system depend strongly on the coupling between the electron on the dot and the cantilever .",
    "the reduction in visibility with increasing coupling is due in part to the cantilever measuring the path taken by the electron and also due to thermal fluctuations in the state of the cantilever .",
    "when the dwell time of the electron on the dot is short compared to the period of the cantilever , the system behaves in a way which is analogous to einstein s celebrated recoiling slit experiment . in contrast , when the dwell time is comparable to the cantilever s period , the cantilever and the electron on the dot show signs of behaving as a single coherent quantum system , so long as the electrons incident on the dot have a sufficiently narrow energy width .",
    "the coherency of the cantilever  dot system is inferred from the appearance of side resonances in the transmission characteristics . including the cantilever s environment in the analysis",
    ", we find that the side resonances are washed out for small enough oscillator @xmath130factor , while the average decrease in the fringe visibility with increasing coupling to the cantilever is not affected .    the basic feature of the reduction of fringe visibility as a function of the coupling between the electron on the dot and the cantilever should be observable in an experiment using currently available technology .",
    "however , the more delicate features such as the side resonances in the transmission amplitude for long dwell times and the effect of the cantilever s environment on these resonances will usually be obscured by the energy thermal width of electrons incident on the dot .",
    "there are two important ways in which our analysis could be extended .",
    "most straightforwardly , we could examine what effect using a double dot , rather than a single one , would have on the behavior of the system . in particular , it would be interesting to see to what extent the electron energy width could be reduced , whilst maintaing an overall , measurable current through the device . the second way our analysis could be extended would be to go beyond our steady state treatment to obtain the time dependence of the transmission amplitude . a time dependent analysis would allow us to make predictions about the way in which the thermal fluctuations in the state of the cantilever cause fluctuations in the phase of the interference fringes . such fluctuations may prove to be observable in ac experiments and may also provide us with another way of inferring information about how the cantilever interacts with its environment .    m.p.b . would especially like to thank eyal buks for many helpful conversations and invaluable suggestions .",

    "because the electric field is strongly limited , we will always be working in the regime where the coupling constant is just sufficient to cause detectable effects .",
    "therefore , since @xmath262 , our assumption that only the fundamental mode is relevant is justified .    as a concrete example",
    ", we consider a nanotube cantilever of length @xmath263  @xmath264 m and outer radius @xmath265  nm.@xcite in this case , the fundamental frequency is @xmath266  mhz and the mass is of order @xmath267  kg . if the tip  dot distance is set at @xmath268  @xmath264 m , then @xmath269 and for a maximum electric field of @xmath270  v / m , the corresponding maximum coupling constant @xmath271 .",
    "v , we calculated the transmission amplitude through the dot , including the effect of the cantilever s environment , by expanding to second order in the interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the dot , @xmath43 , and then re - exponentiating . in this appendix , we justify this result with a full calculation .",
    "the fact that a second order expansion in @xmath43 leads to the exact result is at first somewhat surprising .",
    "however , the important step is the re - exponentiation of the truncated series expansion ( [ if ] ) : we implicitly equate the influence functional with not just the first few terms in an expansion , but with an infinite series of terms which are themselves composed of products of the second order terms we evaluated .",
    "this procedure is generally acceptable as an approximation in the limit of small @xmath43 , but in this particular case the series generated in fact coincides with the exact form obtained from a linked cluster expansion.@xcite    we begin by adopting the notation @xmath272 so that @xmath273 the operators @xmath274 and @xmath275 operate only on the variables of the oscillator bath and they both commute with @xmath276 and @xmath277 which operate on the states of the cantilever alone .    the object which we wish to evaluate is the influence functional @xmath278dt'/\\hbar}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle { \\mathrm{t}}_t   { \\mathrm{e}}^{i\\lambda   \\int_0^{t}\\left[\\hat{o}(t')+\\hat{o}^{\\dagger}(t')\\right]dt'/   \\hbar}\\right\\rangle , \\label{c2}\\ ] ] where we have exploited the commutation properties of the operators to factor the expression into two terms , which we can now write as @xmath279 .",
    "the method we use to evaluate @xmath280 and @xmath281 is based on the application of wick s theorem , as described in the books by mahan@xcite and louisell.@xcite we can write the first term as @xmath282dt'/\\hbar}\\right\\rangle= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}i^n u_n(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath283\\ldots\\right . \\\\ & & \\times\\left.\\left[\\hat{a}(0){\\mathrm{e}}^{(-i\\omega_0-\\gamma)t_n}+\\hat{a } ^{\\dagger}(0){\\mathrm{e}}^{(+i\\omega_0-\\gamma)t_n}\\right]\\right\\rangle . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an obvious simplification arises from the fact that the averages over odd numbers of operators will always vanish and so we can replace @xmath284 by the even index @xmath285 .",
    "we now apply wick s theorem which allows us to write the average of products of pairs of operators as products of the averages of pairs of operators .",
    "thus for @xmath286 , we have @xmath287 where the summation is over all possible pairing combinations of the @xmath285 time labels and @xmath288   \\left[\\hat{a}(0){\\mathrm{e}}^{(-i\\omega_0-\\gamma)t_2}+\\hat{a } ^{\\dagger}(0){\\mathrm{e}}^{(+i\\omega_0-\\gamma)t_2}\\right]\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] the summation over all possible combinations for each term allows us to re - exponentiate so that @xmath289 , where @xmath290 it is important to notice that the exact form of the function of time and frequency multiplying the operators @xmath276 and @xmath277 is unimportant .",
    "these functions give the operators their individual time labels , but because they are just algebraic functions they do not affect the validity of wick s theorem .",
