    "the adler function  @xcite plays a key role in particle physics .",
    "specifically , theoretical description of some strong interaction processes ( e.g. , electron  positron annihilation into hadrons  @xcite and inclusive @xmath0  lepton decay  @xcite ) is inherently based on this function . besides , adler function is essential for confronting the precise experimental measurements of some electroweak observables ( e.g. , muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite and shift of the electromagnetic fine structure constant  @xcite ) with their theoretical predictions . in turn , the latter represents a decisive test of the standard model and imposes strict restrictions on possible `` new physics '' beyond it .",
    "furthermore , adler function plays a crucial role for the congruous analysis of spacelike and timelike experimental data .",
    "indeed , since perturbation theory and renormalization group method are not applicable directly to the study of observables depending on the timelike kinematic variable , for the self  consistent description of the latter one has to relate the timelike experimental data with the spacelike perturbative results . here , the required link between the experimentally measurable @xmath1ratio of electron  positron annihilation into hadrons and theoretically computable adler function  @xmath2 is represented by the dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4mev  @xcite stands for the mass of the lightest hadron state .",
    "the dispersion relation  ( [ adlerdisp ] ) is also commonly employed for extracting the adler function from the relevant experimental data . for this purpose , in the integrand  ( [ adlerdisp ] )",
    "@xmath5 is usually parameterized by its experimental measurements at low and intermediate energies and by its theoretical prediction at high energies",
    ".    the ultraviolet behavior of the adler function can be approximated by the power series in the strong running coupling within the perturbation theory ( see paper  @xcite and references therein ) @xmath6^j.\\ ] ] the overall factor @xmath7 is omitted throughout , where @xmath8 is the number of colors and @xmath9 denotes the charge of the quark of the @xmath10-th flavor . in eq .",
    "( [ adlerpert ] ) @xmath11 is the @xmath12loop perturbative qcd invariant charge , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of active quarks , and @xmath17 .",
    "however , the perturbative expansion  ( [ adlerpert ] ) is invalid at low energies and it is inconsistent with the dispersion relation for the adler function  ( [ adlerdisp ] ) due to unphysical singularities of the strong running coupling  @xmath18 in the infrared domain .",
    "the latter also causes certain difficulties in processing the low  energy experimental data .",
    "in general , there is a variety of the nonperturbative approaches to handle the strong interaction processes at low energies . in this work",
    "we will focus on the approach which engages dispersion relations .",
    "indeed , the latter provide an important source of the nonperturbative information about the hadron dynamics in the infrared domain , which should certainly be taken into account when one is trying to go beyond the scope of perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , dispersion relation  ( [ adlerdisp ] ) imposes stringent physical nonperturbative constraints on the adler function .",
    "specifically , since @xmath5 , being the ratio of two cross  sections , assumes finite values and tends to a constant in the ultraviolet asymptotic @xmath19 , then the adler function  @xmath2 vanishes only . ] in the infrared limit  @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , dispersion relation  ( [ adlerdisp ] ) implies that the adler function possesses the only cut  @xmath21 along the negative semi ",
    "axis of real  @xmath22 .",
    "these nonperturbative constraints on the adler function have been merged with its perturbative approximation in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also discussion of this issue in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . eventually , this results in the following integral representations for the adler function and @xmath1ratio : @xmath23\\ ! , \\\\ \\label{rint } r(s ) & = & \\theta(s-4{m_{\\pi}}^2 ) \\biggl[1 + \\int\\limits_{s}^{\\infty } \\rho(\\sigma)\\,\\frac{d \\sigma}{\\sigma}\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the unit step function , @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "the developed approach  @xcite eliminates such intrinsic difficulties of perturbation theory as the infrared unphysical singularities of outcoming results . besides",
    ", additional parameters are not introduced into the theory .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ rint ] ) by construction accounts for the effects due to the analytic continuation of spacelike theoretical results into timelike domain , such as the resummation of the so - called @xmath28terms .",
    "it is worth noting also that the mass of the lightest hadron state affects both the parton model prediction and the strong correction of the quantities in hand  ( [ adlerint ] ) ,  ( [ rint ] ) .    in the limit of the massless pion",
    "@xmath29 expressions  ( [ adlerint ] ) and ( [ rint ] ) become identical to those of the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) , see papers  @xcite and references therein . however , it is crucial to keep the pion mass nonvanishing , since it can be safely neglected only when one handles the strong interaction processes at high energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is a number of other similar approaches which also combine perturbative results with relevant dispersion relations , see , e.g. , refs .",
