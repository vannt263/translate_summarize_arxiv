    "we consider a metallic strip of finite width @xmath60 , which borders vacuum on the one side and is in contact with a semi - infinite 2d - ti plane on the other . in the ti part",
    "@xmath61 is given by a simplified 2-band bhz - model @xmath62 where in the metallic region @xmath63 is simply taken as a free electron - hole gas ( @xmath64 ) @xmath65 for simplicity we assume the value of the parameter @xmath33 to be the same in the two regions .",
    "to solve for the transverse wave functions in this geometry , we require that the wave function @xmath66 should vanish at the boundary to vacuum at @xmath67 and that @xmath66 should be continuous across the metal - ti boundary at @xmath68 .",
    "we also require the probability current to be continuous across the boundary , i.e. , @xmath69 we then find the secular equation    @xmath70    which may be solved numerically to yield the band structure . here ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the components of the decaying free solutions @xmath73 in the ti - region , @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the decay coefficients ( which have a negative real part as long as @xmath77 ) are given by @xmath78 plots of a typical bandstructure obtained from this model are shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) of the main text together with some sample wavefunctions in fig .",
    "they were obtained using @xmath79 .",
    "one can increase the level of abstraction and still observe the same physics , by not explicitly considering the semi - infinite 2d ti plane but instead replacing it by an effective boundary condition .",
    "this is especially justified if the extent of the evanescent wave component into the 2d - ti is small ( @xmath80 ) , such that the transverse wave function is to a good approximation only located inside the metallic region .",
    "as the considered model of the ti involves many parameters , there is no unique way of achieving this infinitely fast decay and hence there will be no unique set of boundary conditions . the limiting procedure presented in the following",
    "should be understood as one possible way , which will in the end provide a conceptually simple boundary condition , which will capture all important physical features .",
    "for achieving the infinite decay constants we let @xmath81 , i.e. , we will consider a ti with an infinite band gap .",
    "in addition , we will have to rescale @xmath34 by choosing @xmath82 with a parameter @xmath83 having the units @xmath84 .",
    "if one now considers the limit @xmath81 keeping @xmath85 , one finds for the real parts of the decay constants @xmath86 : @xmath87 meaning that we indeed expect the wave functions not to extend into the ti . for this limit",
    ", one can derive the appropriate boundary conditions that any attached two - band hamiltonian should fulfill .",
    "we start from the continuity of the wave function of the metal region @xmath88 and the probability current @xmath89 across the boundary at @xmath68 , @xmath90 for so far unknown constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we are now interested in the behavior of the right hand sides for the limit discussed above . however , as @xmath93 one needs to rescale the constants to obtain a finite value of the wave function at the border to the ti : @xmath94 this way , we find @xmath95 from eq .  .",
    "we can now do the limiting process on the right hand side always keeping @xmath96 fixed , using @xmath97 where , on the way , we made use of the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . to simplify the writing we introduced the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 . from this , we can already find the first boundary condition , as now @xmath102 note that this is independent of the choice of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath83 .",
    "the second boundary condition which links the currents is , however , more complicated and does depend on the choice of @xmath33 and @xmath83",
    ". it can be simplified by additionally choosing @xmath103 , which will then imply @xmath104 if we now subtract the two components of eq .  , @xmath105 and again perform the limits , @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 here , we already made use of the first boundary condition . in total",
    "we find , that the boundary to a ti in the limit discussed above can be approximately described by the following boundary conditions , which still contain one free parameter , @xmath108    which we renamed from @xmath33 to @xmath13 , to distinguish it from the band curvature of the material on which we enforce this boundary condition .",

    "of course the same calculation can in principle be redone for an arbitrary interface orientation .",
    "e.g. , choosing the ti plane to extend in the negative @xmath9-direction with a boundary at @xmath67 , leads to the following set of boundary conditions :    @xmath114    i.e. , we find an additional phase factor in front of one wave function component .",

    "<S> [ figsketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> in such a hybrid structure the non - topological material could be a ( disordered ) metal , a gated semi - conductor or even a conventional anderson insulator . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup exploits the hybridization of the upper ti edge state with the bulk states of the normal material , leading to an imbalance of left and right moving states in the normal material and thereby to a pcc therein  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of pccs in isolated non - topological systems has been earlier predicted for carbon nanotubes  @xcite and graphene nanoribbons  @xcite . there </S>",
    "<S> the pcc was shown  @xcite to arise from an uneven separation of left and right moving states associated with specific ( valley ) symmetries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since atomic defects or short - ranged impurity potentials break this symmetry , pccs are rather fragile in these graphene - based systems and have not yet been observed therein . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the proximity - induced pccs reported here are robust against any kind of disorder as long as time - reversal symmetry is preserved , even in presence of spin - orbit coupling .    to our knowledge </S>",

    "<S> we first demonstrate the emergence of a proximity - induced pcc by means of a band structure analysis within a simplified model calculation . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we will present numerical results that show the same features in hgte / cdte - based ribbons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will study features of the pcc in quantum transport for experimentally realizable setups . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we reveal the creation of a pcc in an otherwise insulating disordered strip and how to disentangle the signature of a pcc from the diffusive modes in a disordered conductor .    throughout this manuscript we model the electronic structure of a 2d hgte / cdte quantum - well by the four - band bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath0 with spin - subblock hamiltonians @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , the off - diagonal coupling parameter @xmath4 describes a dresselhaus - type spin - orbit coupling of the two spin blocks @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we consider a 2d heterostructure of a usual conductor and a semi - infinite topological insulator plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to first look at a simplified model system which already captures the important physical features . </S>",
    "<S> the metal part  @xcite is modeled by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : bhzhamilton ] ) with @xmath5 , describing a free electron - hole gas . </S>",
    "<S> confined to a finite - width strip by hard wall boundary conditions , this leads to an electron - hole symmetric parabolic band structure , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ figbands](a ) exhibits the bulk band gap and a single edge state . a coupling between the two systems is implemented by replacing the central hard wall constraint by the continuity of the wave function @xmath7 and the flux @xmath8 across the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting band structure , shown in fig .  [ figbands](b ) , resembles the one of the metallic strip , but contains an extra band ( marked in blue ) as a remainder of the topological edge state , which does not feature the linear momentum dependence because of band repulsion due to hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions at various energies in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> instead , the former edge state fully hybridizes with the metallic bands and covers the whole extended state region ! </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with ref .   where the authors also observe an extended metallic state in a 3d heterostructure , but differs from the findings of ref .  , where a protection from hybridization for topological edge states is reported for a 2d quantum hall insulator on top of a 3d substrate .    </S>",

    "<S> [ figbands ] ) , which leads to a pcc at any fermi energy . including the other spin block and spin - orbit interaction </S>",
    "<S> only slightly changes this picture . since both spin blocks feature a pcc with opposite propagation direction in the decoupled system , the combined system has an equal but _ odd _ number of left and right moving channels . </S>",
    "<S> due to the time - reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian , the scattering matrix can be written in a basis where it is anti - symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> together with the odd number of channels , this implies a single pcc in each direction  @xcite . as the wave functions of all channels are predominantly localized in the metallic region </S>",
    "<S> , one can say that the proximity of the ti induces a single additional channel in each direction leading to one net pcc in the metallic region . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the quasi 1d edge state of the ti migrates into the metallic region and forms an extended pcc . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is generally true for materials with extended states . </S>",
    "<S> it should provide a valuable tool to create and observe pccs as they inherit the topological protection of the former edge channels and are expected to be stable for any disorder and interface type , as long as the latter allows for sufficient hybridization .    </S>",
    "<S> given that the ti is a good insulator , i.e. , that the decay length of the states inside the insulator is short compared to the width of the metallic ribbon , one expects that only a vanishing part of the probability density of a state is inside the ti . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for replacing the explicit consideration of the ti by an effective boundary condition for the wave function @xmath7 inside the metallic ribbon . for the right boundary of a heterostructure in @xmath9-direction </S>",
    "<S> it reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12-th component of the state obtained by applying the velocity operator normal to the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> note that , eq .  ( [ eq : bcrobin ] ) still contain a free parameter @xmath13 , which stems from the band curvature of the ti . the effect @xmath13 is best seen by applying the boundary conditions to a topologically trivial insulator , like a gapped electron - hole gas : then the group velocity of the emergent edge state band linearly depends on @xmath13 . using the boundary conditions on the gapless electron - hole gas from the previous model heterostructure , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this geometry decouples the edge channel on the lower edge of the ti from the region with the pcc . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary , as the lower edge state would add another channel to the scattering matrix , make it even dimensional and therefore lift the protection of the pcc . if the pcc in the upper metal is well coupled to the two metallic leads ( e.g. , by making the leads wide ) , the total transmission @xmath16 between the upper leads will be at least one . even in presence of disorder </S>",

    "<S> the whole system can consist of a common hgte / cdte quantum well with inverted band order , where only the upper ( metallic ) part has a fermi energy outside the ti bandgap , a setting that can be realized by local gating . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup leads to a hybridization of the upper pair of edge states of the ti with the bulk states of the metallic part , while the lower pair is still localized at the lower edge of the ti . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding band structure in fig .  [ figbs](b ) reveals that a single spin block contains an additional right moving state ( red lines ) , whereas the left mover is still localized at the opposite boundary in the ti region ( blue ) . </S>",

    "<S> can be broken by a magnetic flux leading to a broader distribution for the high transmission eigenvalues [ right panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figtunnel](a ) ] .    the change of this probability distribution is also reflected in transport quantities , which can be experimentally probed . for example , upon raising the tunnel barrier @xmath44 the transmission at @xmath49 exhibits a quantized minimum , which reflects the presence of a pcc , as shown by the red line in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> as expected , this feature disappears at small magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> a more pronounced pcc signature is found in the shot noise power  @xcite , @xmath55 , depending on the transmission eigenvalues @xmath56 between the upper leads . for conventional diffusive transport </S>",
    "<S> the bimodal distribution leads to a universal @xmath57 suppression of the shot noise [ @xmath58 , as marked by a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figtunnel](c ) ] , independent of the universality class of the material  @xcite . in presence of a tunnel barrier all @xmath56 except the one of the pcc tend to zero , leading to a characteristic shot noise suppression , as shown by our numerics in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figtunnel](c ) for @xmath54\\,{\\rm mv}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath33-field destroys the pcc , which in turn removes the shot noise suppression . at finite @xmath33 , in absence of the pcc the shot noise signal even increases above @xmath59 due to the tunnel barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the tunnel conductance and shot noise as promising , experimentally accessible observables to verify the ti proximity induced pcc .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we showed that the proximity of a 2d topological insulator ( ti ) creates a robust perfectly conducting channel ( pcc ) in an adjacent non - topological material . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this is a quite general effect that should work for almost all materials with extended states . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a similar phenomenon exists for a disordered conductor at the surface of a 3d ti . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we showed that the proximity of a 2d ti to a metal can be understood in terms of a robin type effective boundary condition , responsible for the creation of the pcc . </S>",
    "<S> this does not only allow simplifications in future theoretical studies , but might also pave the way to induce pccs by artificially creating such boundary conditions , e.g. , by using metamaterials for electromagnetic waves , without relying on ti heterostructures .    </S>",
