    "the supernova remnant ( snr )  is one of only three oxygen - rich snrs known in the galaxy .",
    "the other two ( puppis  a and cas  a ) have central compact objects , the nature of which however remains mysterious ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "has the appearance of a composite snr , with a central peak and a shell @xmath8 in diameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "asca x - ray observations ( @xcite ) detected a non - thermal nebula coincident with the central radio component .",
    "recent  ( acis - s ) observations have shown this nebula to be @xmath9 in extent , and to contain a resolved compact source located near its peak .",
    "this discovery , together with the energetics of the nebula , provides nearly incontrovertible evidence for the existence of a pulsar powering the nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  observations of  are a beautiful example of the recent flood of x - ray data with high spatial , temporal and spectral resolution that is advancing dramatically our understanding of the varied outcomes of supernova explosions .",
    "in particular , x - rays provide an important complement to the radio band , the traditional hunting ground of pulsar studies .",
    "in this letter we report the discovery and key parameters of the pulsar in  in a deep observation with the parkes radio telescope .",
    "the characterization of this young and energetic pulsar is important for the analysis of existing x - ray and radio data on .",
    "moreover , this discovery has significant implications for the concept of `` radio - quiet neutron stars . ''",
    "the location of  was searched by the parkes multibeam pulsar survey of the inner galactic plane ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ) that has discovered more than 600 pulsars    = 8.0truecm    ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density limit at the location of the  pulsar candidate was @xmath12mjy at a frequency @xmath13mhz .",
    "a similar limit was reached in a directed search of the snr by kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) at @xmath14mhz . at a distance @xmath15kpc ( see below ) , the corresponding luminosity limit is a not particularly constraining @xmath16mjykpc@xmath7 : @xmath17 of known pulsars have luminosities below this value ( see fig .  [ fig : lr ] ) .",
    "on september 5 , 2001 we searched the pulsar candidate position ( see table  [ tab : parms ] ) at the parkes telescope using the center beam of the multibeam receiver at a central frequency of 1374mhz with a filter bank spectrometer having 96 channels spanning a total band of 288mhz for each of two polarizations .",
    "signals from each channel and polarization were square - law detected , high - pass filtered and summed in polarization pairs .",
    "each of the 96 channels was then integrated and one - bit digitized at 1ms intervals and recorded to magnetic tape for off - line analysis .",
    "the total observation time was 10.2hr .",
    "standard search algorithms were used to reduce the data .",
    "first , strong narrow - band radio interference was identified and removed by masking five offending frequency channels .",
    "next , data from @xmath18 time samples ( 9.3hr ) were de - dispersed at 325 trial dispersion measures ( @xmath19@xmath20pc ) .",
    "each of the 325 resulting time series was then searched for periodic signals over a range of duty cycles with an fft - based code ( described in detail by @xcite ) identifying significant features in the fundamental amplitude spectrum as well as in spectra with 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 harmonics folded in . finally a limited but finer search in period and dm was made of the entire data set for the best dispersed candidates from this stage .",
    "a good pulsar candidate was found with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath21 , barycenter - corrected period @xmath22ms , and @xmath23@xmath20pc .    on october 3 , 2001",
    "we confirmed the pulsar with a detection of @xmath24 in a 5hr observation , with identical dm and @xmath25ms , immediately implying a large period derivative @xmath26 . following the initial radio detection ,",
    "new  ( hrc ) data were searched for x - ray pulsations . as detailed by hughes et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in a companion letter , pulsations were found at a consistent period from the location of the previously identified pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , ensuring beyond any doubt that we have discovered the pulsar near the center of snr  .",
    "the measured dm , together with the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for the galactic distribution of free electrons , implies a pulsar distance of 11kpc .",
    "however the pulsar is located in the direction of the carina spiral arm , where the model suffers from systematic errors .",
    "in fact , a new electron density / distance model ( cordes & lazio , in preparation ) suggests a pulsar distance of 5.7kpc ( j.  cordes , private communication ) .",
    "the snr shows hi absorption to beyond the tangent point in this direction ( @xcite ) , implying a lower limit on the distance of 3.2kpc .",
    "since the snr shows absorption towards all more distant emission , no upper limit can be put on its distance from these data .",
    "a distance estimate is also available from the observed value of reddening , @xmath27kpc ( @xcite ) . in light of these various constraints on pulsar",
    "/ snr distance we adopt hereafter the estimate @xmath28kpc .",
    "we have begun regular timing measurements of the new pulsar at parkes , with 35hr typically needed to obtain a satisfactory pulse profile and corresponding time - of - arrival ( toa ) .",
    "the average pulse profile has a single approximately symmetric component with @xmath29 . using the toas , the arcsec - accuracy position measured with , and the tempo timing software , we have obtained a phase - connected solution , with the resulting spin parameters listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "the pulsar appears to suffer a large amount of `` timing noise , '' with large and systematic residuals from the second - order fit listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "fitting of four spin - frequency derivatives removed the systematic component of this noise , leaving a final rms timing residual of 0.4ms .",
    "the s / ns have remained constant when scaled by integration time , suggesting that the pulsar s flux is not greatly modulated by interstellar scintillation .",
    "we use this and the known observing parameters , telescope gain and system temperature , including the contribution to the latter from the snr ( @xcite ) , to estimate a flux density of @xmath30jy .",
    "the measured @xmath31 and @xmath32 of  imply that it is a very young and energetic pulsar .",
    "the implied characteristic age and surface magnetic dipole field strength are @xmath33yr and @xmath34 g respectively .",
    "the spin - down energy loss rate @xmath35ergs@xmath3 ( where a neutron star moment of inertia @xmath36gcm@xmath7 has been used ) , in excellent agreement with the value predicted by hughes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from the energetics of the pwn , if @xmath38kpc . in comparison with the sample of @xmath39 rotation - powered pulsars",
    "known , j1124@xmath405916 ranks as the 6th youngest in terms of @xmath41 and the 8th most energetic in terms of @xmath42 .",
    "the age of  is derived to be @xmath43yr from a measurement of the high radial velocity oxygen - rich material positionally coincident with the central synchrotron nebula ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the pulsar characteristic age is a factor of nearly two larger than this .",
    "assuming that the age estimate for the snr represents the true age of the system , this discrepancy can be simply explained if the initial spin period of  was @xmath44ms ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is slower than for the six other young pulsars whose initial periods have been estimated , all of which have @xmath45ms .",
    "alternatively the pulsar may spin down with a braking torque that is different from the usually assumed constant magnetic dipole . in a study of pulsar population dynamics , cordes & chernoff ( 1998 )",
    "suggest alternate forms of braking torque ( e.g.  a braking index of 2.5 with a magnetic field decay time @xmath46myr ) that result in actual pulsar ages smaller than @xmath41 by a factor @xmath47 . in the absence of a measured braking index for ,",
    "we tentatively regard a relatively large @xmath48 as a preferred explanation .    in table",
    "[ tab : young ] we summarize key parameters for the youngest rotation - powered pulsars known , ordered by decreasing @xmath42 . heading the list are the three `` crab - like '' pulsars , with extremely large @xmath42 .",
    "the remaining six young pulsars are varied in their properties and generally follow the trend of increasing @xmath31 and @xmath49 with decreasing @xmath42 ( with the pulsar in g11.2@xmath400.3 a notable exception ) .",
    "their spin - down luminosities are 20200 times lower than the crab s and many are therefore difficult to detect : four were discovered just in the past two years ( two each in radio and x - rays )",
    ".    in its spin parameters  is most similar to psr  b1509@xmath4058 ( see table  [ tab : young ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that their respective pwne also have comparable luminosities . in the 0.24kev x - ray band ,",
    "we find for the pwn powered by j1124@xmath405916 that , as is typical for such sources . ]",
    "@xmath50ergs@xmath51 for a distance 5kpc ( @xcite ) , while for b1509@xmath4058 we find @xmath52ergs@xmath53 in the same energy range ( @xcite ) . for their respective radio pwne",
    ", we find @xmath54ergs@xmath55 for j1124@xmath405916 ( @xcite ) , while @xmath56ergs@xmath57 for b1509@xmath4058 ( @xcite ) .    thus the efficiencies with which these pulsars power their x - ray nebulae differ only by a factor of @xmath58 , while those for their radio nebulae are approximately equal .",
    "although these pulsars have comparable spin parameters , we explain below that their pwne have quite different environments and likely evolutionary histories .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the efficiencies with which they convert their spin - down into nebular flux are so similar .    in the radio band",
    ", it has been argued that a pulsar s initial parameters can make a crucial difference to the resultant luminosity of its pwn at later times ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if a pulsar is born spinning rapidly and has a high magnetic field , it will dump most of its spin - down energy into its surrounding nebula at the earliest stages , when adiabatic losses are most severe ; this will result in a comparatively underluminous radio pwn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , a pulsar that is otherwise similar but born spinning more slowly will not release its energy so quickly , so that its nebula will suffer less from expansion losses and will be correspondingly brighter at radio wavelengths .",
    "we have argued above that  was possibly born with a comparatively long spin period , @xmath59ms , while psr  b1509@xmath4058 is generally assumed to have been born with a crab - like @xmath60ms ( @xcite ) .",
    "the comparable values of @xmath61 for their pwne are therefore not easily explained .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the radio and x - ray extents of the pwn powered by psr  b1509@xmath4058 are approximately equal indicates that synchrotron cooling does not yet dominate the nebula at high energies ( @xcite ) , and can account for this nebula s comparatively low x - ray efficiency ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for  the x - ray nebula is noticeably smaller than its radio counterpart ( @xcite ; gaensler & wallace , in preparation ) , indicating that the x - ray emitting electrons are in this case efficient radiators .",
    "thus we expect the x - ray luminosity of the pwn around j1124@xmath405916 to be much larger than observed , closer to the factor @xmath62 seen for the crab nebula and other x - ray pwne dominated by radiative losses ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus both @xmath61 and @xmath63 for the pwn powered by  are much lower than expected through simple physical arguments .",
    "there are a variety of other factors which can affect a pwn s luminosity : the pulsar braking index , pwn magnetic field , and nebular expansion velocity all are important parameters at radio wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the lorentz factor of the wind , the radius of the termination shock and the magnetization parameter , @xmath64 , all have a strong bearing on the nebula s x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unexpectedly similar nebular efficiencies for psrs  j1124@xmath405916 and b1509@xmath4058 , along with the large range of efficiencies among the other young pulsars in table  [ tab : young ] , emphasize that we still lack a detailed understanding of how a pulsar ultimately deposits its energy .",
    "one particularly interesting young pulsar in this regard is psr  j1119@xmath406127 ( @xcite ; table  [ tab : young ] ) , which has no known radio - bright pwn down to extremely constraining surface brightness limits ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also has no confirmed x - ray - bright pwn ( although a possible candidate was detected by @xcite ) .",
    "this example , together with several relatively young and energetic pulsars that do not power detectable pwne ( @xcite ) , suggests that pulsar environments need not be good `` calorimeters . ''",
    "thus , some young pulsars may pass unnoticed unless their beamed radiation is favorably oriented so that pulsations may be detected .",
    "that radio pulsar beams do not in general sweep @xmath65sr is a fact of life .",
    "although it is generally accepted that the beaming fraction @xmath66 is period dependent , with short - period pulsars beaming to a larger fraction of the sky than their long - period counterparts , a consensus has yet to emerge on the form of @xmath67 .",
    "pulse width analyses suggest @xmath68 for a pulsar with @xmath69s ( @xcite ) while , from an analysis of pulsar  pwn associations , frail & moffett ( 1993 ) find @xmath70 . since pwne are regarded as unambiguous indicators that a young pulsar is present , the failure to detect pulsations towards such sources is usually ascribed solely to a misoriented pulsar beam .",
    "however , the case of  and its faint radio pulsar highlights an important caveat : the radio luminosity limit implied by a non - detection should now be below at least @xmath71mjykpc@xmath7 , approximately the luminosity of , and possibly as low as @xmath72mjykpc@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lr ] ) , before one can invoke unfavorable beaming as an explanation .    various analyses",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) have suggested that young pulsars have higher radio luminosities than older ones .",
    "figure  [ fig : lr ] shows that the basis for such arguments is weak in the case of very young pulsars .",
    "the least luminous radio pulsar previously detected for which @xmath73kyr had @xmath74mjykpc@xmath7 .",
    "the fact that some x - ray - detected pulsars have had much more constraining luminosity limits put on their radio emission ( e.g.  @xcite ; table  [ tab : young ] ) has usually been taken to imply that these pulsars have radio beams which are not directed towards us .",
    "however , the discovery of  shows that very young pulsars can certainly have much lower radio luminosities than previously thought , either due to intrinsically low luminosity or to our line of sight cutting only low - level wings on the emitted beam .",
    "the above discussion serves as a cautionary tale in the context of discussions of exotic sources such as the `` radio - quiet neutron stars '' ( rqnss ) , `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axps ) and `` soft @xmath75-ray repeaters '' ( sgrs ) . while there is no question that these sources have properties which make them distinct from `` normal '' radio pulsars ( e.g.  @xcite",
    "; @xcite ; gaensler et al .  2000a ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the fact that none of these sources has been detected at radio wavelengths has been taken to imply that their radio pulse mechanism must be inactive ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the radio luminosity limits for many of these sources are not particularly stringent by the standard of radio pulsars , and there are so few of these objects known that they all could be radio luminous and yet all could still be beaming away from us ( @xcite ) .",
    "it may well be that the rqnss , axps and sgrs are all truly radio - silent , but this conclusion is difficult to justify until the luminosity limits available for such objects reach a level equivalent to at least the smallest radio luminosities observed for radio pulsars , @xmath76mjykpc@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lr ] ) , and in principle even smaller values .    with the discovery of j1124@xmath405916 ,  becomes the second example of an oxygen - rich snr with a confirmed rapidly spinning pulsar ( after 0540@xmath40693 in the lmc ) .",
    "it remains to be seen what is the true nature of the compact sources in the other two galactic oxygen - rich snrs .",
    "this discovery also suggests that very deep searches for radio pulsations from known pwne and possibly other more exotic neutron stars may be well worthwhile .",
