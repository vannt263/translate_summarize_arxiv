    ", the top quark may well be sensitive to interactions that do not affect other fermions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the companion paper , top decay is investigated for the presence of np .",
    "it is noted that , given the good agreement between the experimental measurement of @xmath2 and its theoretical prediction  @xcite , significant np contributions to top decay can only be present in decay modes that are suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one example is @xmath3 , whose amplitude involves the small element @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "@xcite focuses on this decay at the lhc , where top production occurs predominantly via gluon fusion : @xmath6 .",
    "the goal is to find observables in the channel @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 that can reveal the presence of np .",
    "np contributions to the decay @xmath7 can be parametrized in terms of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "if one restricts to dimension-6 operators , then this is realized in the form of ten operators that span all possible lorentz structures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two types of observables are identified that can then be used to get a handle on this np .",
    "the first consists of invariant mass - squared distributions involving the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 quark pairs coming from @xmath3 . as for the second type",
    ", we note that , in @xmath6 , the spins of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are correlated .",
    "the spin - correlation coeffcient ( @xmath14 ) depends only on the production process",
    ". however , since the @xmath12 quark has an extremely short lifetime , this quantity has to be inferred by measuring the angular correlation between the decay products of the @xmath12 and those of the @xmath13 .",
    "if there are np contributions to the decay , the inferred value of @xmath14 is necessarily altered from that of the sm .",
    "it is this feature that provides information about the np .",
    "therefore , the second type of observable consists of these angular correlations .",
    "they are taken between the @xmath15 coming from the @xmath13 decay and one of @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 coming from the @xmath12 decay .",
    "the np operators not only change the top branching fraction of this decay , but also modify the shapes of these distributions .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the np contributions to all of the above observables can be written in terms of certain combinations of the np couplings , denoted as @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the observables are found to be practically unaffected by parton densities , etc .",
    ", so that they provide direct access to the values of these @xmath19 s .",
    "now , the observables described above involve the @xmath16 quark coming from the decay of the @xmath12 .",

    "we also take the contribution from @xmath21 into account , examining its effect on the aforementioned observables and their sensitivity to the @xmath19 s . in our simulations",
    "we consider numbers of total events representative of lhc measurements in both the short and long terms . while the long - term results obviously have smaller errors , it is still possible in the short term to detect and partially identify np in @xmath3 .",

    "the np contributions to this can be parameterized by the effective lagrangian @xmath25 , with @xmath26 here the colour indices are assumed to contract in the same way as in the sm ( i.e. , the fields @xmath16 with @xmath12 and @xmath27 with @xmath17 ) .",
    "colour - mismatched terms , in which the indices contract in the opposite way , may occur in certain models and can be incorporated in a straightforward manner  @xcite .",
    "the np couplings ( the @xmath28 in the above equations ) contain weak phases , but the strong phases are negligible @xcite . in addition , the @xmath28 may be assumed , quite generally , to be @xmath29 .",
    "the sizes of the sm and np contributions to @xmath3 would then be roughly equal .",
