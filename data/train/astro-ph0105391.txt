    "to fully appreciate the closed or leaky box nature of dwarf galaxies , their full nucleosynthetic and star forming histories must be established .",
    "doing so requires that stars lying in the extreme low- and high - metallicity tails of their host galaxies be found and studied .",
    "unfortunately , the coupling of age and metallicity with position on the red giant branch ( rgb ) makes a photometric search for such stars difficult . even for systems characterized by a single burst of star formation , identifying bona fide metal - rich stars on the basis of photometry alone is challenging since carbon stars",
    " by virtue of their strong molecular absorption in the ultraviolet and the resulting flux redistribution to longer wavelength  have colors which can mimic those of more metal - rich objects .",
    "the carbon stars belonging to pop ii systems are usually of the ch - type ( aaronson et  al .",
    "1983 ) , named for the spectral characteristics of metal - poor but carbon - rich stars .",
    "it is commonly believed that they result from mass transfer in compact binary systems ( mcclure 1984 ) .",
    "thus , carbon stars provide insights into binary formation and evolution .",
    "the ursa minor and draco dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies have long been suspected of showing an intrinsic dispersion in abundance ( e.g. , zinn 1978 ) .",
    "recently , high - resolution spectroscopy for a dozen stars in these galaxies has provided unmistakable evidence for an intrinsic spread in metallicity in both objects : i.e. , @xmath6[fe / h ] = 0.73 and 1.53 dex for ursa minor and draco , respectively ( shetrone , ct & sargent 2001 ) . in each case , the most metal - rich member was found to have [ fe / h ] @xmath3 dex .",
    "however , recent photometric studies of these galaxies reveal a number of objects which fall redward of their fiducial giant branches , so it is conceivable that their metallicity distribution functions extend to still higher metallicities .",
    "this is particularly true of ursa minor , which has been the subject a proper motion survey by cudworth , seitzer & majewski ( 2002 ) .",
    "these authors find a small number of ostensible members whose location in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) makes them prime candidates for metal - rich stars .    in this paper , we present the results of a small survey of stars redward of the fiducial giant branches of the ursa minor and draco galaxies to determine whether these objects are metal - rich rgb stars , carbon stars or nonmembers .",
    "we find no evidence for a population of stars more metal - rich than [ fe / h ] @xmath3 dex in these galaxies .",
    "every radial velocity member which falls further to the red of the rgb fiducial sequences , and for which adequate spectrosopic material is available , is found to be a carbon star .",
    "program stars in the direction of ursa minor and draco were selected from the photometric catalogs of stetson ( 2002 ) and cudworth et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , respectively . since this latter study also reports proper motion measurements , we only selected stars with membership probablities in excess of 50% . since our aim was to establish the full range in metallicity spanned by stars in these galaxies , we targeted objects displaced from the canonical red giant branches ( rgbs ) , with particular emphasis on the red , potentially metal - rich objects .",
    "note that some stars redward of the fiducial rgbs have published radial velocities ( e.g. armandroff , olszewski & pryor 1995 ; hereafter a95 ) , and a few are classified as carbon stars ( aaronson et  al .",
    "1982 ; azzopardi et  al . 1986",
    "; olszewski et al . 1995 ; aaronson et  al . 1983 ; canterna & schommer 1978 ; zinn 1981 , a95 ) .",
    "we re - observed a number of these stars to confirm the precision of our radial velocities , to use as carbon star abundance standards , and to look for weak carbon star features missed by previous , lower signal - to - noise analyses .",
    "the observations were conducted at the hobby - eberly telescope during the second queue observing period of 2000 .",
    "the marcario low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et  al .",
    "1998 ) was used in its highest resolution mode  a 600 l / mm grating , 1@xmath7 slit , and 2x2 binning  to produce a resolution of @xmath8 = 1200 . in this configuration",
    ", a 0.1 binned pixel velocity precision would be 25 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the program was conducted in a wide range of seeing conditions , lunar phases and atmospheric transparencies . despite the variety of observing conditions ,",
    "the spectra had typical signal - to - noise ratios of s / n @xmath9 25 , obtained in single exposures of less than 20 minutes ; the total time spent with the shutter open on the sky for this program was four hours .",
    "for each spectrum , flat - field and line calibration lamps were taken .",
    "the spectra were reduced with standard iraf long - slit extraction packages .",
    "the initial wavelength scales were applied using hgcdzn and ne lamps .",
    "velocity zero - point corrections were made by using the many weak night emission lines in this portion of the spectrum ( osterbrock et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum of each star was inspected visually to identify any strong molecular features such as tio , cah , c@xmath2 , cn , or ch . for those stars lacking strong molecular features ,",
    "a synthetic spectrum was created using the colors given in table 1 and our own color - temperature - gravity relationship for an assumed metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath101.8 dex .",
    "a synthetic template spectrum was generated for those stars with visible molecular features . for objects with visible tio and cah features",
    ", we created a solar metallicity synthetic spectrum , using an incomplete tio line list .",
    "stars showing c@xmath2 , cn , and ch features , were modeled using a synthetic spectrum with [ fe / h ] = @xmath101.8 dex and an enhanced carbon abundance : i.e. , @xmath11(c ) @xmath12 @xmath11(o ) .",
    "radial velocities were measured via cross - correlation with these templates .",
    "previous radial velocity analysis ( e.g. a95 and olszewski et  al .",
    "1995 ) employed radial velocity standards instead of synthetic templates .",
    "analyses which employ radial velocity standards are able to remove some intrinsic systematic instrumental biases but sometimes suffer from flexure zero point errors and spectral type mismatches .",
    "using synthetic templates and the night time emission or absorption lines allows one to side step the latter problems but does not give any information about the former .",
    "a similar technique was employed in shetrone ( 1994 ) with high resolution spectra .",
    "the use of synthetic templates for cross - correlation is also useful for programs which are queue scheduled on large telescopes when instrument setups change hour to hour and the data is acquired over the course of months and telescope time does not need to be spent on bright radial velocity standards .",
    "data for the confirmed members of ursa minor and draco are reported in table 1 , which gives the star i d , previous identifications following the naming scheme in a95 , right ascension , declination , s / n per 2 pixel resolution element , and lrs radial velocity .",
    "comments concerning the classification of the stars are given in the final column .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 compares our lrs velocities with those measured by a95 .",
    "there is a systematic offset of 10 km s@xmath0 with a standard deviation of 11 km s@xmath0 around that offset .",
    "the lower panel of figure 1 shows the velocity differences , @xmath13 , plotted against s / n per resolution element .",
    "if the offset in these differences is taken to be the result of zero - point difference , then we find that lrs in its highest resolution mode can achieve a velocity accuracy of @xmath9 15 km s@xmath0 .",
    "recall that a 0.1 binned pixel velocity error would be 25 km s@xmath0 , as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "a comparison was made between the synthetic carbon star spectrum and those of known carbon stars in ursa minor and draco .",
    "although the absolute carbon and nitrogen abundances from this _ ad hoc _ model can not be trusted , the carbon abundance is higher than the oxygen abundance , and the fit is visually similar to the observed spectra of the known carbon stars . for each star",
    ", we created a pair of synthetic spectra : i.e. , one with , and one without , enhanced carbon abundances . for the coolest stars ,",
    "the c@xmath2 features are the strongest features in the spectrum ; among the hotter stars , the c@xmath2 features are similar in strength to the atomic features . given the signal - to - noise of our spectra , we are able to detect the hot carbon stars that previous investigations would have missed .    figure 2 shows our lrs spectra for five stars belonging to ursa minor .",
    "the sample includes one previously recognized carbon star , three new carbon stars , and one apparently normal rgb star . in this galaxy ,",
    "we therefore confirm the carbon star identification of one giant , um152 ( 30614 ) , and detect several additional carbon stars : um1545 ( 37759 , n42 ) , um1859 ( 35869 ) , and um536 ( 32961 , ji12 ) . in draco , we confirm the classification of one carbon star , j ( c2 , 20733 ) , and identify one new carbon star : 68 .",
    "a complete list of the 13 carbon stars in these two galaxies is presented in table 2 .",
    "the radial velocity members of draco which fall on the galaxy s fiducial giant branch are 195 , s37 and m. all stars with visible tio and cah bands were found to be nonmembers .",
    "we find eight nonmembers which fall redward of the rgb in draco , including two stars ( 90 and 193 ) previously identified as nonmembers from their proper motions ( stetson 1980 ) . a single star located to the blue of the rgb",
    "was also found to be a nonmember .",
    "likewise , two stars located redward of the rgb in ursa minor were found to be nonmembers .    for ursa minor",
    ", only one radial velocity member in our sample has an abundance pattern which is definitely not that of a carbon star .",
    "this star , um1846 ( 347 , 35606 , 297q3 ) , was studied by shetrone et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) as # 297 using high - resolution spectra from the keck i telescope .",
    "they found it to have [ fe / h ] = @xmath101.68@xmath140.11 dex .",
    "using our low resolution spectra we can constrain the abundance to [ m / h ] = @xmath15 . with the exception of this star , we note that all of the proper motion members located redward of the rgb in this galaxy are now classified as carbon stars",
    "this situation may also hold in draco although there are a number of additional objects located redward of the rgb for which spectroscopy is not available . unfortunately",
    ", our spectrum for star 194 in draco lacks the s / n needed to determine if it too is a carbon star .",
    "we can merely constrain the abundance of this star to be [ m / h ] @xmath16 dex based upon the depth of the blended atomic features .",
    "additional spectroscopy for this star , as well as for the remaining objects located on the red side of the draco rgb , might prove profitable .    in figure 3 , we show cmds for both ursa minor and draco . in the right panel ,",
    "radial velocities of draco from a95 and our lrs survey have been used to separate members from nonmembers in the photometric catalog of stetson ( 2002 ) .",
    "the cmd of radial velocity and/or proper motion members in ursa minor is shown in the left panel of this figure .",
    "the new carbon stars are indicated by the filled stars , while the previously known carbon stars are denoted by the filled squares . in both galaxies ,",
    "the new objects fall below the tip of the rgbs  similar to the known carbon stars which , from infrared photometry , have bolometric magnitudes of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the bulk of these stars are almost certainly ch - type carbon stars ( mcclure 1985 ) rather than the more luminous n- and r - type carbon stars found in some local group dwarf galaxies which contain intermediate - age populations ( aaronson & mould 1985 ) .",
    "possible exceptions to this claim may be stars j ( c2 , 20733 ) and 461 in draco , which we find to be photometric variables ( at the 10 and 4@xmath18 levels , respectively ) .",
    "such variability is common among asympototic giant branch ( agb ) stars belonging to intermediate - age populations .",
    "the existence of a small , intermediate - age component in draco has been suggested by carney & seitzer ( 1986 ) and grillmair et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who noted the presence of a population of stars above the main - sequence turnoff . on the other hand , radial velocity monitoring of stars j ( c2 , 20733 ) and 461 ( olszewski et  al .",
    "1996 ) show no evidence for the variations which might be expected in _ either _ scenario for their enhanced carbon abundances : i.e. , mass - transfer from evolved close secondaries or dredge - up during agb evolution , an evolutionary phase characterized by thermal pulsations .",
    "the solid curves in each panel of figure 3 show 12 gyr isochrones from bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) having [ fe / h ] @xmath19 , and shifted according to the reddenings and distances given in mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , almost every star which is radial velocity and/or proper motion member of these galaxies , and which falls redward of the rgb expected for an old , [ fe / h ] @xmath3 population , is classified as a carbon star .",
    "the three carbon stars discovered by armandroff et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) in these two galaxies increased the number of such objects from six to nine .",
    "our lrs survey brings their census to @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the frequency of carbon stars in these dsph galaxies with those in galactic globular clusters .",
    "ct et al .",
    "( 1997 ) identified a total of three stars in globular clusters which show strong c@xmath2 bands ( two in @xmath21 cen and one in m14 ) , among a sample of @xmath22 clusters ( harris 1996 ) . if the selection criterion is relaxed to include hotter stars which show strong cn and ch absorption but no c@xmath2 bands , then @xmath23 ( mcclure 1984 ) .",
    "since the mean luminosity of galactic globular clusters is @xmath24 @xmath25 , the specific frequency of ch stars in globular clusters , @xmath26^{-1},~\\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] is found to be @xmath27 mateo ( 1998 ) reports luminosities of 2.9@xmath28 and 2.6@xmath28 @xmath25 for ursa minor and draco , respectively .",
    "thus , the specific frequency of ch stars in these galaxies is @xmath29 or 25 - 100 times higher than that for globular clusters .",
    "since field ch stars are known to be the end - products of mass transfer between contact binaries ( mcclure 1984 ) , the disparity between these specific frequencies may be evidence that in the denser globular - cluster environments , binaries are either disrupted or driven toward orbital shrinkage and eventual coalescence long before the primary can become an agb star and experience carbon dredge - up and subsequent mass transfer .",
    "binary systems in the looser dwarf spheroidal systems and in the field , on the other hand , can normally survive long enough to reach this phase of evolution .",
    "renewed searches for additional ch stars in local group dwarf galaxies might prove worthwhile , given that the census of such stars in ursa minor and draco , once thought to be complete , has increased by nearly 50% .",
    "we have used the hobby - eberly telescope and marcario lrs to carry out a search for metal - rich stars in the ursa minor and draco dsph galaxies . from a comparison of our radial velocities for stars in common with those targeted by previous higher - resolution studies",
    ", we find that lrs is sufficiently stable to achieve a radial velocity accuracy of approximately 1/15 pixel , or 15 km s@xmath0 at s / n @xmath30 25 per resolution element .",
    "although a number of members were found redward of the fiducial rgb in this survey , there is no evidence for a population more metal - rich than [ fe / h ] @xmath3 dex in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , nearly every radial velocity member redward of the fiducial rgb is found to be a carbon star . combining our sample of four new carbon stars with those previously known",
    ", we find a total of seven carbon stars ursa minor and six in draco .",
    "thus , relative to galactic globular clusters , these galaxies appear to be are overabundant in carbon stars by a factor of 25 - 100 .",
    "we extend our thanks to the staff of the hobby - eberly telescope and , in particular , to grant hill , brian roman , gabrelle saurage , and teddy george for providing the high quality service observations that made this project possible .",
    "thanks also to kyle cudworth for providing the photometry for ursa minor prior to publication .",
