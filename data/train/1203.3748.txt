    "our simulations provide valuable insight into hydrodynamic and mhd developments , which will likely be relevant to multiphysics simulations of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "we summarize our simulation results as follows    * vigorous turbulence develops via secondary hydrodynamic instabilities ( e.g. , the kelvin - helmholtz instability ) in the shear layer separating the counterrotating flows induced by the spiral sasi mode , and we find that the specific kinetic energy spectrum develops kolmogorov - like scaling ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) in the wavenumber range separating the post - shock forcing scale ( given by the low - order sasi modes ) and the dissipation scale ( set by finite grid resolution in our simulations ) . * our simulations suggest that the sasi saturates nonlinearly due to the development of post - shock turbulence @xcite .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the specific kinetic energy spectrum ( ) illustrates how the turbulence saps energy from the low - order sasi modes . in the saturated state",
    ", a significant fraction of the post - shock kinetic energy is due to turbulence ( with @xmath138  km  s@xmath48 ) . * the sasi - driven turbulence results in magnetic field amplification by stretching via an efficient small - scale dynamo .",
    "the turbulence is essentially non - helical and is similar in many ways to convectively driven mhd turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field evolution is sensitive to numerical resolution . in particular , the magnetic energy growth rate and saturation amplitude remain uncertain .",
    "however , estimates using data extracted from our simulations suggest that the magnetic energy may grow on a millisecond timescale under more realistic physical conditions ( i.e. , with @xmath139 ) . *",
    "the induced magnetic fields have no noticeable effect on the global shock dynamics , and this can be understood from simple considerations of the energetics : a relatively small fraction of the post - shock kinetic energy is accessed for magnetic field amplification . on the other hand ,",
    "sasi - driven turbulence may contribute nontrivially to proto - neutron star magnetization .",
    "( simple estimates suggest pns magnetic fields exceeding @xmath136  g. ) thus , the formation of strongly magnetized proto - neutron stars may not necessarily be linked uniquely to magnetorotationally - driven supernova explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but may merely result as a by - product of the violent dynamics associated with the explosion of massive stars .",
    "given that the sasi may play a central role in facilitating neutrino powered explosions , our simulations suggest that turbulence  through its role in the nonlinear saturation of the sasi  may play an important role in core - collapse supernova models as well .",
    "we have intentionally adopted a simplified physics model in order to carry out our simulations with high spatial resolution .",
    "they therefore represent an initial contribution towards a complete understanding of supernova dynamics , and the role of turbulence in particular .",
    "( recently , murphy & meakin @xcite proposed a turbulence model for the core - collapse supernova problem . ) the role of turbulence in supernova models must be further investigated in the context of multiphysics simulations .",
    "fortunately , such simulations  in three spatial dimensions  are now becoming available , although initially with limited spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the impact of the disparate evolution of turbulent flows in 2d and 3d on core - collapse supernova simulations will be important to establish .",
    "current state - of - the - art , multiphysics simulations of neutrino - powered explosions @xcite , carried out in two spatial dimensions with axial symmetry imposed , emphasize the importance of the sasi in facilitating the explosion .",
    "the post - shock flows in these simulations are clearly turbulent due to both neutrino - driven convection and the sasi .",
    "however , it is known that two - dimensional ( inviscid and incompressible ) turbulence supports a so - called inverse cascade , where smaller vortices of equal size coalesce to form larger vortices , which leads to increased turbulent energy on spatial scales larger than the turbulent driving scale @xcite ; i.e. , opposite to the turbulent cascade in 3d ( cf . ) .",
    "comparisons between 2d and 3d simulations have been carried out in the context of parametrized models @xcite .",
    "in particular , hanke et al .",
    "@xcite observed diverging asymptotic behavior with increasing grid resolution in their 2d and 3d simulations : their 2d models explode more easily with increasing resolution , while the opposite is true for their 3d models , and they attribute these differences to the different cascading nature of 2d and 3d turbulence .",
    "clearly , a better understanding of the role of turbulence in 2d and 3d simulations of the sasi ( and how they potentially differ ) is important to establish .",
    "we plan to investigate this issue in detail in a future study .",
    "neutrino - driven convection develops in the post - shock flow on a timescale that is generally shorter than that of the sasi ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it will also be important to better understand the interplay between the turbulence induced by neutrino - driven convection and sasi development ",
    "in particular , the influence of pre - existing turbulence on the coherence of the low - order sasi modes .",
    "we can not completely dismiss turbulence - induced magnetic fields as unimportant to the explosion dynamics . with simple considerations of the energetics ,",
    "we have argued above ( and elsewhere @xcite ) that the magnetic fields induced by sasi - driven turbulence have little potential to impact the global shock dynamics .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields ( model @xmath30 versus model @xmath28 ) results in less turbulent kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "however , given the difficulties associated with finite grid resolution when simulating mhd turbulence in large scale simulations such as those presented here , one must use caution when extrapolating conclusions based on low reynolds number simulations to systems governed by extremely large reynolds numbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations merely suggest that mhd turbulence ( as opposed to hydrodynamic turbulence ) may be the more appropriate description of turbulence in core - collapse supernovae , and a better understanding of the impact of magnetic fields is clearly needed here . moreover , with respect to magnetic field evolution in ccsne , we have not considered ( i ) the impact of strong differential rotation near the surface of the pns ( which can excite the mri ; e.g. , @xcite ) , or ( ii ) the impact of neutrino - driven convection .",
    "studying the confluence of ( i ) and ( ii ) ( which alone can excite an @xmath101 dynamo @xcite ) with turbulent amplification by the sasi is needed to better understand the role of @xmath119-fields in ccsne . a combination of multiphysics simulations _ and _ simulations of simplified models ( guided by multiphysics simulations ) is needed .",
