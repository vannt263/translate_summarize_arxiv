    "the recent discovery  @xcite of the higgs boson  @xcite provides an opportunity to check the phenomenological consistency of various scenarios of electroweak symmetry breaking with measurements for the first time .",

    "whether this excess persists or future measurements of the diphoton partial decay width will return to the standard model ( sm ) values as suggested by recent cms results @xcite is unclear at the moment .",

    "a generic prediction of electroweak precision measurements in this case is the appearance of doubly charged scalar particles @xmath3 with a mass of several hundred gev that result from the weak triplet structure in the higgs sector extension .    due to the quantum numbers of the @xmath4 triplet ,",
    "majorana mass - type operators can induce a prompt decay of @xmath3 into two leptons with identical charge @xcite .",
    "this interaction has already been constrained at the lhc in multilepton searches  @xcite . however , as soon as the mass of the doubly charged scalar exceeds twice the @xmath5 mass , the decay to gauge bosons is preferred .",
    "this can be seen from the scaling of the partial decay widths : @xmath6 . over the bulk of the parameter space",
    "this leads to a dominant decay of the doubly charged higgs to @xmath5 bosons  @xcite .",

    "such a process is mediated by a non - trivial color exchange in the @xmath9 or @xmath8 channels , which results in large scattering angles of the energetic final state jets .",

    "@xcite remain essentially unchanged also when non - oblique corrections ( in the @xmath109 case ) are included .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : modela ] and  [ fig : modelb ] we show the exclusion potential of the search strategies discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cms ] and  [ sec:14tev ] , together with the surviving points for the two scenarios we just described .",
    "the standard color coding is used for the exclusion plots , which here are shown as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath140 . from these plots",
    "we conclude that the searches at 7 tev , if extended with wbf - like selection cuts , start to be able to probe , and hence exclude , some of the surviving scenarios . the more relevant result ,",
    "however , is that wbf searches on the 14 tev data will have the potential to completely rule out all the points that survive all other constraints .",
    "this search has therefore the potential to become a decisive obstacle that models with higgs triplets and large triplet - doublet mixing have to pass in order not to be excluded . as such , it would be very important for lhc experimental collaborations to look into these final states .",
    "in particular an analysis based on the same - sign lepton wbf channel serves to also constrain the parameter region which is allowed in other recent analyses such as ref .",
    "higgs triplets as implemented in the georgi - machacek model provide a viable extension of the sm higgs sector which can be efficiently probed at the lhc .",
    "we have demonstrated that while current analyses of same - sign lepton final states do not provide a strong enough constraint on the presence of doubly charged scalar bosons decaying to same - sign @xmath5 s on the basis of susy searches , the enlarged statistical sample of the 8 tev 2012 run should start constraining this model via the non - adapted susy search strategy .",
    "furthermore we have shown that a simple modification of these susy searches allows us to constrain the model already with 7 tev data even for a conservative background estimate .",
    "the model can be ultimately verified or ruled out at the lhc with 14  tev in a clean wbf selection .",
    "our results are quite general and at the same time realistic as far as models with triplets are considered . in particular , studying @xmath1 rather than the more commonly considered case @xmath157 seems to be more natural , because of the dominance of the former decay over the latter for the bulk of the parameter space independent of the considered triplet scenario .",
    "moreover , the analysis strategies we studied in this work are quite standard , but at the same time can lead to conclusive results for a complete exclusion of higgs sectors with triplets .",
    "we therefore think that it would be very important for the lhc experimental collaborations to consider these searches in addition to the already considered and simpler case @xmath157 .",
