    "many galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) display two relatively well defined ( `` hard '' and `` soft '' ) spectral states ( grove et al . 1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "there is no well established theory as to why these transitions occur , nor is there a complete understanding of what constitutes either of these definite states , though a variety of models have been suggested .",
    "recently , nayakshin & melia ( 1997a ) have shown that the spectrum of cygnus x-1 in its hard state can be explained by the two - phase model with magnetic flares accounting for the patchy overlying corona , if one takes into account the time - dependent nature of these flares ( also referred to below as active regions [ ar ] ) .",
    "the two - phase model was originally applied to seyfert galaxies by haardt & maraschi ( 1991 , 1993 ) ( though the model of a hot corona above the cold accretion disk was suggested long before that for the galactic source cygnus x-1 ; see , e.g. , liang & price 1977 ) in order to explain the observed multi - wave band spectrum of these sources , and appears to be successful in accounting for many of the observed features in these objects ( see also galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; field & rogers 1993 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; svensson 1996 ; nayakshin & melia 1997b , c , d ) .",
    "nayakshin & melia ( 1997a ) also showed that the differences in the spectrum , the ionization state of the cold disk , and the iron lines and edges in the hard state of cygnus x-1 compared to the corresponding observables in seyfert galaxies may be a natural consequence of a change in the physical state of the _ transition layer _",
    ", where the hard x - rays from the ars are reflected or reprocessed . therefore , the magnetic flare - cold disk model appears to be a `` unifying '' link between seyferts and gbhcs in their hard state .    in view of the fact that gbhcs display the softer spectral state as well , it would be helpful to examine more fully the physics of magnetic flares in a cold disk to see if these can provide an explanation for both states , and the transitions between them . in this _ letter _ , we attempt to determine whether or not the flare activity is correlated with the physical state of the disk . in particular , we shall examine whether the rate of magnetic flare generation within a radiation - dominated disk is diminished relative to that in a gas dominated configuration .",
    "if this holds true , then the model would predict that radiation - dominated accretion disks should be in a softer state , while gas dominated disks should be in the hard state .",
    "finally , we will compare the model predictions with the available observations of gbhcs and neutron star ( ns ) systems .",
    "the reasons why strong x - ray emission might be expected from magnetic flares in accretion disks were first pointed out by galeev et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , who showed that magnetic field dissipation inside the disk is not efficient in limiting the magnetic field growth .",
    "the field is therefore likely to grow to its equipartition value and then be expelled from the disk due to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "once outside , the field can in principle transfer its energy to particles by reconnection or some other mechanism , not unlike the manner with which the sun releases energy in flares ( e.g. , parker 1979 ; priest 1982 ) . the work of galeev et al .",
    "( 1979 ) shows that magnetic flares may in this fashion account for a substantial energy outflux .",
    "the fact that the differential rotation in disks is stronger than in stars might also imply a stronger turbulence , convection and therefore , relatively speaking , possibly even a more intense magnetic field than is seen in stellar environments .    at the same time",
    ", the standard accretion disk theory of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) invokes only radiation transport as the mechanism for transferring the gas thermal energy out of the disk ( see bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ) .",
    "we shall try to account for the energy being transported out of the disk by magnetic flares with a simple parameterization ( cf . svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; hereafter sz94 ) . the vertical velocity associated with the flux tube buoyancy is limited to the gas sound speed , and the magnetic pressure",
    "is limited by the gas plus radiation pressure .",
    "accordingly , we will parameterize the magnetic energy flux for the gas dominated region of the disk as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter of order @xmath8 or less . in equilibrium , assuming that the inward advection of energy in the disk is not dominant , the gravitational energy dissipation rate should be approximately equal to the power carried outwards by the radiation ( with a flux @xmath9 , in terms of the radiation pressure @xmath10 and the disk vertical optical depth @xmath11 ) and the magnetic field .    vishniac ( 1995 ) has argued that @xmath7 is likely to be of order @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the viscosity parameter in a standard accretion disk . with this prescription , the magnetic flare energy flux would only be a small ( @xmath14 ) fraction of the radiative power from the disk . in a longer",
    "follow - up paper ( nayakshin & melia 1997e , hereafter paper ii ) we shall discuss why @xmath7 can be much larger than this estimate for magnetic flux tubes with a large spatial scale ( i.e. , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the disk scale height ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath7 may be as large as @xmath13 , which will be interpreted as an indication that the magnetic field energy transport can be extremely efficient compared to that due to radiation ( see discussion below and eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) .    before investigating the consequences of this parameterization of the magnetic energy flux ,",
    "let us first discuss the analogous situation in radiation dominated disks . here , the physics is not as clear cut since the radiation does not interact directly with the magnetic field , but rather via the particles .",
    "as is well known ( e.g. , parker 1979 ) , the maximum pressure within a magnetic flux tube is set by the external pressure .",
    "however , when the flux tube is optically thin , even if it were radiation free initially , the photons diffusing into it would eventually raise the internal radiation pressure to the external value , and the internal magnetic field pressure could then be only as large as the gas pressure . in paper ii",
    ", we will provide an estimate showing that this is indeed the case for accretion disks in the standard theory ( see also sakimoto & coroniti 1989 ; stella & rosner 1985 ) .",
    "we expect that in the radiation - dominated regime , most of the magnetic field is diffuse , or at best that it forms weak flux tubes , and that it therefore results in a more nearly uniform heating of the upper disk atmosphere as opposed to localized high - energy magnetic flares .    to formalize in the simplest way the foregoing discussion in our modeling of the magnetic flare flux , @xmath17 , we will write @xmath18 for both the gas- and radiation - dominated disks , in which @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gas pressure and density , respectively .",
    "this parameterization assumes that the radiation is completely decoupled from the magnetic field , so that only the gas pressure can contribute to the strength of the flare .",
    "a more sophisticated approach than this will be given in paper ii .",
    "here we use the simpler approach for clarity , since it provides a good overall description of the magnetic flux and is well suited for comparing to observations of gbhcs . using the standard disk equations ( e.g. , frank , king & raine 1992 ) , one can show that the total dissipation rate of the gravitational energy per unit area of one side of the disk is @xmath22 . in a steady state disk with negligible advection",
    ", @xmath23 should be equal to the magnetic plus radiative flux .",
    "therefore , for the radiation flux one can write @xmath24\\;.\\ ] ] this expression is in the form of equation ( 4 ) of sz94 , who assumed that only a fraction @xmath25 of the gravitational energy is dissipated inside the disk ( and subsequently is transferred out by radiation ) , whereas the remaining fraction @xmath26 is transferred to the overlying optically thin corona and is dissipated there .",
    "we thus see that the fraction @xmath26 of sz94 can be interpreted in our picture to be @xmath27 .",
    "however , we caution that locally , the ratio @xmath28 of the x - ray flux from the ar to the local intrinsic disk flux _ during the flare _ is still much higher than @xmath29 , because the latter is the ratio averaged over the whole disk , i.e. , it includes regions where flares are not active at a given time . to reconcile these two quantities",
    ", we introduce the covering fraction @xmath30 of the magnetic flares ( see haardt et al .",
    "1994 ) , defined as the ratio of the total area covered by the active regions at a given time to the whole area of the disk enclosed by a characteristic size @xmath31 dominating the emission , such that @xmath32 .",
    "this allows the x - ray spectrum to be steep even in cases where @xmath33 .",
    "we will now attempt to use our very simple model for the magnetic flux to delineate the distinct regions of the solution phase space .",
    "the most important parameter is the dimensionless accretion rate , @xmath34 , defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the actual accretion rate , and @xmath37 erg / sec is the eddington luminosity for a 10 solar mass black hole ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "first of all , it is already clear that the model predicts that the x - ray spectrum softens as the accretion rate increases and the radiation pressure starts to dominate over the gas pressure , since the importance of magnetic flares as the mechanism for generating an outward energy flux decreases . at the same time",
    ", the vertical optical depth of the accretion disk decreases ( see sz94 ) with increasing @xmath39 , and so the average photon finds it easier to escape from the disk , thus making radiation transport more important compared to the flares .",
    "to quantify this situation , we shall seek an approximate description of the ratio @xmath40 for all accretion rates . we do this by taking the average of this ratio ( found in sz94 ) for the radiation - dominated and gas dominated disks . also , we define @xmath41 , which is the limiting value of @xmath26 for @xmath42 .",
    "the fraction @xmath26 as a function of @xmath43 is then @xmath44 . carrying this derivation out , we obtain an implicit relation between @xmath39 and @xmath43 : @xmath45\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath47^{4/5}$ ] , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the distance from the black hole in terms of the gravitational radius .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the run of @xmath51 versus the accretion rate @xmath39 .",
    "the curves are labeled by their corresponding value of @xmath52 . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the accretion disk solution is that dominated by magnetic flares . in the context of our model",
    ", this region corresponds to the hard states of gbhcs and ns systems ( see nayakshin & melia 1997a for a discussion of the cygnus x-1 hard state spectrum ) .",
    "the region to the right of the `` kink '' in the curves corresponds to the soft states .",
    "however , we should keep in mind the fact that this very simple model yields the _ minimum _",
    "@xmath39 for which the transition can occur , since we have assumed that the radiation is completely decoupled from the magnetic field , so that the flares subside as @xmath54 becomes larger than 1 . at the same time , the accretion disk is still optically thick at @xmath55 , as one may confirm using the results of sz94 ( assuming @xmath56 ) .",
    "therefore , we should also investigate the possibility that the transition occurs at a higher value of the ratio @xmath54 . to account for this qualitatively",
    ", we assume that @xmath57 may be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath60 is that the radiation decouples from the gas when @xmath54 is larger than @xmath60 .",
    "the run of @xmath51 versus the accretion rate @xmath39 is in this case shown in figure 2 , where the solid curve corresponds to the case @xmath61 .    comparing figures 1 and 2",
    ", we see that magnetic flares are important in the overall disk energy balance when the parameter @xmath52 is close to 1 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath60 is close to 1 , then the transition from flare - dominated to radiation transfer dominated disks is relatively gradual , and occurs over a dynamic range in @xmath63 . however , for @xmath64 , the transition can be very abrupt , and may be triggered with just a @xmath65 change in @xmath39 .",
    "this is interesting in view of the fact that recent state transitions in cygnus x-1 have been observed to occur with at most a @xmath65 change in the overall disk luminosity ( proportional to @xmath39 in this model ) during a hard - soft - hard cycle ( zhang et al .",
    "finally , @xmath66 may lead to two values of @xmath26 for the same @xmath39 , i.e. , the disk may be either in the hard or the soft state .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the hard state is stable against decay to the soft state in this region of phase space , since a vertical perturbation of the disk may result in a decoupling of the radiation from the flares and a consequent transition from the hard to the soft state .",
    "moreover , with our simple parameterization , it is difficult to judge what range of @xmath60 is physical .",
    "this question will be pursued in the future , but for now we will study cases with @xmath67 and @xmath68 as representative values in order to compare the predictions of our model with the observations .",
    "recently , barret , mcclintock & grindlay ( 1996 ) assembled a sample of gbhcs and several other transient sources in a @xmath69 phase space , where @xmath70 is the hard x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath2 kev , and @xmath71 is the x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath3 kev .",
    "one of the striking results of this exercise is that both neutron stars and gbhcs always have relatively soft spectra when they radiate at a high fraction of their eddington luminosity . in particular , none of the former show a hard tail in their spectrum at a luminosity higher than about @xmath72 erg s@xmath73 , or @xmath74 of the eddington luminosity for a @xmath75 ns . for gbhcs ,",
    "this dividing luminosity is a fraction of @xmath76 erg s@xmath73 , or about @xmath77 for a @xmath78 @xmath79 black hole .",
    "similarly , grove , kroeger & strickman ( 1997 ) and grove et .",
    "1998 ) showed that gbhcs occupy at least four spectral states in order of decreasing x - ray luminosity .",
    "in particular , they found that when the x - ray luminosity ( above @xmath8 kev ) is at about the eddington limit , the spectrum is dominated by the so - called ultrasoft blackbody component with @xmath80 kev ; a weak hard tail is seen above @xmath81 kev , and rapid intensity variations are present . at lower luminosities ( typically @xmath82 ) , the spectrum again shows an ultrasoft component and a weak hard tail , but rapid intensity variations are weak or absent .",
    "the hard state exhibits a single power - law spectrum with a photon number index @xmath83 , and corresponds to a luminosity in the range @xmath84 erg s@xmath73 .",
    "finally , for the low luminosity , quiescent state , @xmath85 erg s@xmath73 , but its spectral shape is not very well known .",
    "we note that the luminosity above 1 kev should be close to the disk s bolometric luminosity since the temperature in the soft state is about @xmath8 kev , and thus most of the blackbody power should lie above @xmath8 kev , whereas in the hard state the intrinsic disk temperature can be much smaller , i.e. , @xmath86 kev , but its contribution to the overall spectrum is negligible compared to that of the hard power - law ( see , e.g. , gierlinski et al .",
    "1996 ) .    interpreting these intriguing results in terms of the accretion rate ( assuming a rest mass energy conversion efficiency of 0.06 ) , we see that the accretion rate dividing the hard and soft states seems to be @xmath87 for gbhcs and @xmath88 for ns .",
    "positioning these values in figure 2 , it is evident that those curves with @xmath89 @xmath90 few correspond to a transition from the flare - dominated to the no - flare regimes at @xmath91 .",
    "in addition , we note that the intrinsic universality of the two - phase model is well suited to explain the relatively broad luminosity range ( @xmath84 erg s@xmath73 ) covered by the hard state . indeed , this spectral universality was the primary reason for the original application by haardt & maraschi ( 1991 ) of the two - phase model to seyfert galaxies , whose spectra display the `` standard '' intrinsic x - ray photon index @xmath92 .",
    "namely , once @xmath93 , the x - ray spectral slope and the ratio @xmath94 are dictated by the reflection / reprocessing of x - rays at the surface of the underlying cold disk .",
    "it is unlikely that these processes will scale significantly with the bolometric luminosity in gbhcs ( see , e.g. , nayakshin & melia 1997a , b ) , and we therefore expect for the region @xmath93 , that the ratio @xmath94 will be approximately independent of the source luminosity .",
    "however , this situation is bound to break down at some relatively low luminosity , since one of the key assumptions of the model is that the formation of the spectrum is due to the compton up - scattering of the lower energy photons . at the same time , the compactness of the ar is decreasing with decreasing @xmath39 , and at @xmath95 bremsstrahlung takes over as the leading radiation mechanism ( see fabian 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , the explanation for the observed optical depth of seyferts and gbhcs proposed by nayakshin & melia ( 1997c ) requires the compactness to be larger than unity as well . using the estimates of nayakshin & melia ( 1997d )",
    ", it is possible to show that the lowest luminosity for which the two - phase model is still valid is likely to be of order @xmath96 @xmath97 ( using their eq.[5 ] with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and with a magnetic pressure within the flux tube set at the disk equipartition value ; a smaller magnetic pressure will only increase this luminosity ) .",
    "below this minimum luminosity , the spectrum should be quite different from that in the hard state , and it is likely to be dominated by the soft intrinsic disk emission .",
    "a power - law tail similar to the solar x - ray spectrum may be present as well , since a compactness @xmath100 is also pertinent to the magnetic flares in the sun .",
    "accordingly , both the minimum and maximum luminosities of the hard state in gbhcs with @xmath101 seem to be consistent with the predictions of the magnetic flare - disk model .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also plotted the evolutionary track of the gbhc transient source grs 1124 - 68 on the same @xmath69 phase diagram . during its evolution , this source occupied both a hard and a soft state , and it spanned a broad range in luminosity .",
    "it therefore constitutes an especially interesting object to study in the context of our model . to simulate its spectral evolution",
    ", we assume the spectral model of nayakshin & melia ( 1997a ) in order to describe the hard spectral state of the accretion disk . for a given @xmath39 , we can find the corresponding value of @xmath43 from equation ( 1 ) , which allows us to compute @xmath57 , i.e. , the fraction of the gravitational energy being deposited within the active region . for simplicity ,",
    "we also assume a fixed covering fraction @xmath102 ; our results depend very weakly on this value since the phase space trajectory is decided mostly by the evolution of @xmath57 , describing the partitioning of the total available power into the cold disk and flare components .",
    "it is then possible to determine the spectrum for a broad range of @xmath39 , and in figure 3 , we show the decomposition of this spectrum into the hard ( @xmath70 ) and soft ( @xmath71 ) components ( for two values of @xmath60see the caption to the figure ) , together with the data for grs 1124 - 68 ( adopted from barret et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this figure also includes the data for other bhbs ( i.e. , for gbhcs that have well established mass estimates ) , whose @xmath70 and @xmath71 are inferred from figure 1 of barret et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , using their table 1 for the black hole masses .",
    "the cygnus x-1 data are also plotted for reference . within the framework of this model ,",
    "the hard x - rays in both the hard and soft states of cygnus x-1 are created by the same mechanism , viz .",
    "magnetic flares , but in the soft state most of the total accretion power is dissipated inside the accretion disk , which acts to soften the spectrum . here , the disk s effective temperature @xmath103 is assumed to evolve such that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the intrinsic disk flux and @xmath106 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "it is evident from figure 3 that the lower part of the phase space trajectory , within the region where @xmath107 , is described quite well by the magnetic flare model .",
    "as discussed above , the region with @xmath108 corresponds to parameter values where the flares are efficient in producing hard x - rays , and the model predicts a more or less constant ratio @xmath94 . above @xmath108 , the hard x - ray luminosity declines sharply due to a decrease in the efficiency of magnetic flare generation , since the radiation pressure , constituting the largest reservoir of available energy when @xmath109 , decouples from the magnetic field .    what happens at a still higher value of @xmath39 where the model can not reproduce the sharp rise in the hard x - ray luminosity ?",
    "this question is beyond the scope of the present paper , since this high accretion rate is clearly outside the region of applicability of the magnetic flare model .",
    "for such high values of @xmath39 , the magnetic flares become ineffective in transporting the dissipated gravitational energy out of the disk . at the same time , it is well known that radiation dominated disks are unstable , and thus it may well be that the disk finds another mechanism for transporting energy outwards .",
    "for example , the disk may establish a full corona , heated by hydromagnetic waves , or the disk may evolve into the two - temperature configuration of shapiro , eardley & lightman ( 1974 ; see also bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ) .",
    "whatever its nature , the disk must clearly use a different mechanism for producing the x - rays because the dip in the @xmath69 plane is very sharp , suggesting that one emissivity law is being phased out while a second is being turned on .",
    "we will address this question more fully in future work .",
    "there also remains a great deal to be done with neutron star systems , which we have only touched on here .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative luminosity - spectral state relationship for nss should be similar to that of the black holes , and on this basis we conclude that the spectral evolution of gx-339 shown in figure 3 of barret et al .",
    "( 1996 ) identifies it as either a black hole positioned further away ( @xmath110 kpc ) than usually assumed , or more likely , as a neutron star .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic flare - disk model makes clear predictions about the relationship between the spectrum and the accretion rate ( or equivalnetly , the total disk luminosity ) .",
    "in particular , this model predicts that more luminous sources should have softer x - ray spectra , if their luminosity is larger than about 5% of their eddington limit .",
    "we have compared the model predictions with the available data for gbhcs and ns systems , and have found a good agreement with the observations within the uncertainties .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion we can make is that if the luminosity - spectral state relationship reported here is confirmed by future studies , this representation may allow us to estimate the mass of disk - accreting x - ray sources whose bolometric luminosity is known , and may thus prove to be a valuable tool in both galactic and extragalactic x - ray astronomy .",
    "this work was partially supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 3075 ."
