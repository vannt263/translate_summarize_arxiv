    "in recent years , progress has been made in the search for exotic mesons such as glueballs , hybrids and multi - quark states .",
    "investigation of these states will not only extend our understanding of hadronic physics beyond the standard quark model , but will also provide insight into non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "independent observations of an exotic isovector @xmath6 state are of particular interest because of its special quantum numbers and decay modes identifying it as a hybrid meson .",
    "the @xmath7 with mass @xmath8 mev , width @xmath9 mev decaying into @xmath10 was observed by both e852 and crystal barrel in very different production processes @xcite . the @xmath11 with mass @xmath12 mev , width @xmath13 mev , decaying into @xmath14 ,",
    "was also observed by e852 @xcite .",
    "though the underlying structure of this state is not yet understood , a new important decay mode @xmath15 has been recently reported , where the exotic resonance has a mass @xmath16 mev and a width @xmath17 mev @xcite .",
    "spectra and decay characteristics of hybrids have been studied with a variety of theoretical methods such as the mit bag model , flux tube model , potential model , quark - gluon constituent model , qcd sum rules and lattice gauge theory , but the exploration is neither complete nor definitive @xcite .",
    "the exotic @xmath18 hybrid is generally predicted to be the lowest lying hybrid state , but predictions of its decay rate vary widely in these analyses motivating further investigation .",
    "theoretical studies of hybrid decays using three point function sum - rules have identified @xmath19 as the dominant decay mode compared to @xmath20 @xcite . however , the complications associated with @xmath1 mixing ( which can potentially include a gluonic component ) is a possible source of the discrepancy between these theoretical investigations and experimental observations which find comparable widths in the @xmath10 and @xmath14 channels .",
    "the mixing of @xmath4 and @xmath21 has been the subject of many investigations @xcite . in the traditional mixing scheme ,",
    "the @xmath22 states are regarded as superpositions of the flavor octet and the flavor singlet with a single mixing angle which can be determined from physical processes .",
    "however , recent investigations show that this picture may not be correct @xcite and a new orthogonal quark - content basis has been proposed @xcite .",
    "decay constants and the mixing angle have been extracted in this new scheme .",
    "further insight into @xmath4-@xmath21 mixing can thus be gained from calculation of @xmath18 hybrid decays to @xmath23 in the two schemes , and comparing with the existing experiments in these channels .",
    "issues of @xmath24 mixing are reviewed in section 2 , including the interpolating currents needed in the sum - rule method .",
    "the qcd sum - rules for the decays @xmath25 are developed in section 3 , and their analysis is given in section 4 .",
    "the final section is reserved for conclusions .",
    "conventionally , @xmath4 , @xmath21 states are considered as superpositions of an @xmath27 flavor octet @xmath28 and a flavor singlet @xmath29 with one mixing angle @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 octet and @xmath34 the @xmath33 singlet axial - vector current .",
    "it is typically assumed that the decay constants follow the pattern of state mixing : @xmath35 with the decay constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 are defined by couplings of @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the divergence of the relevant axial vector currents : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gluonic field strength tensor and its dual is @xmath40 . through analyses of physical processes involving @xmath22 ,",
    "the mixing angle is respectively found to be @xmath41 or @xmath42 according to the quadratic and the linear gell - mann - okubo mass formula .",
    "however , recent investigations indicate that the three parameters @xmath43 representation ( [ parameter ] ) of the decay constants defined in ( [ coupling ] ) do not seem to follow the same mixing pattern as the physical states @xcite .",
    "motivated by the different influences on the flavor structure of the breaking of @xmath33 and the state mixing of vector and tensor mesons , a new @xmath1 mixing scheme is proposed @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the two orthogonal basis states @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related to the physical states by the transformation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a unitary matrix defined by @xmath48 and ideal mixing corresponds to the case @xmath49 .    in the same way ,",
    "the decay constants are defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the axial vector currents with quark content @xmath52 .",
    "their explicit form are @xmath53 with divergences @xmath54,\\\\\\nonumber \\partial_{\\mu}j^s_{5\\mu}&=&2m_s\\bar si\\gamma_5s+{\\alpha_s\\over4\\pi}g\\tilde{g},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 . through these divergences ,",
    "the decay constants can also be written as @xmath56 phenomenological analysis in this scheme reveals that the decay constants follow the pattern of the state mixing corresponding to a mixing angle @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "following the sum - rule methods of @xcite , the three point function used for the sum rule corresponding to @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 in the flavor octet - singlet mixing scheme , the interpolating currents @xmath61 for these processes are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while in the new quark @xmath24 mixing scheme , the appropriate currents are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    at leading order in perturbation theory and to lowest order in the non - strange quark masses , the quark components of the currents can be ignored in the correlation function compared to the gluonic component .",
    "thus the gluonic component of the currents provides the dominant qcd contribution .",
    "since this gluonic contribution to the correlation function is proportional to @xmath66 , we focus on the anti - symmetric factor @xmath67 . using the results of @xcite",
    "leads to the following theoretical expressions for @xmath68 at the symmetric euclidean point @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath68 ( @xmath71 ) are results corresponding to different currents in ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "note that since @xmath63 has no gluon anomaly term , the leading - order perturbative contribution to @xmath72 is suppressed by non - strange quark mass factors and can consistently be set to zero within our approximation .",
    "a fascinating aspect of this three - point function is the suppression of perturbative corrections compared with nonperturbative effects .    to get the phenomenological representation of the three point function , we define @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the polarization vector of the hybrid .",
    "from the discussions in section 2 , the interpolating current @xmath61 couples to both the @xmath4 and @xmath75 states , indicating that the saturation with one channel in the three point function is insufficient .",
    "thus @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing effects require saturation of the three point function with two channels : @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for simplicity ,",
    "the contributions of single pole terms and high excited states are omitted in our results , leading to the phenomenological result @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the strong couplings and @xmath71 .",
    "equating the theoretical side with the phenomenological side and taking a borel transformation of @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the borel variable and the pcac relation @xmath84 has been used . the notation @xmath85 is a reminder that the strong couplings are referenced to the octet - singlet mixing scheme , while @xmath86 indicates the quark mixing scheme .",
    "the above sets of equations can be solved for the strong couplings which then lead to the decay widths through @xmath87 results of this analysis will be presented in the next section .",
    "for the analysis of the sum - rules , we use qcd and hybrid meson parameters consistent with @xcite @xmath88 combined with the ref .",
    "@xcite values for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay constants in the two mixing schemes @xmath89 other parameters occurring in the sum - rule are completely standard : @xmath90 mev , @xmath91 gev , @xmath92 gev . via ( [ equ1])([equ3 ] ) , these parameters completely determine the strong couplings and hence the decay widths in the two mixing scenarios .",
    "a difficulty associated with this procedure is the large uncertainty associated with @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) @xcite , and the lack of freedom to consider smaller values of the hybrid mass @xmath95 that would be consistent with the @xmath7 .",
    "however , since @xmath93 is a common scale on the phenomenological side of the sum - rules , ratios of couplings can be obtained independent of @xmath93 with the freedom to vary @xmath95 .",
    "we will also ignore any uncertainties associated with the remaining input parameters since the symmetric kinematic point and the simple phenomenological model used in the sum - rule introduces uncertainties which are not easily modelled .",
    "thus our results should be considered as determining the characteristic scales of the decay widths for comparison of the two mixing scenarios .",
    "we begin by considering the octet - singlet mixing scheme .",
    "figure [ os_couplings ] displays the strong couplings as a function of the borel scale @xmath83 . as necessary in a sum - rule analysis ,",
    "the couplings show @xmath83 stability , and there exists an extremum at a reasonable scale which then defines the sum - rule prediction of the coupling . for the parameters given in ( [ rho_hat_params])([coupling_params ] )",
    "we find extremely small decay widths @xmath96 these results are consistent with other sum - rule analyses using the same mixing scheme which conclude that the widths are no larger than @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "figure [ os_ratio ] displays the ratio of the sum - rule prediction of the strong couplings as a function the hybrid mass . as noted above",
    ", this ratio is independent of the value @xmath93 from @xcite .",
    "the ratio is remarkably stable at a value of @xmath98 leading to @xmath99 over the range @xmath100 .",
    "thus in the octet - singlet mixing scheme , the decay widths for both processes are very small and @xmath101 .",
    "the quark mixing scheme leads to substantially different results .",
    "figure [ qm_couplings ] displays the strong couplings as a function of the borel scale @xmath83 , leading to the sum - rule predictions @xmath102 in stark contrast with the octet - singlet mixing scheme , the quark mixing scheme generates a large width for the @xmath76 process comparable to that observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "figure [ qm_ratio ] displays a stable ratio for the sum - rule prediction of the strong couplings as a function the hybrid mass @xmath103 leading to @xmath104 over the range @xmath100 .",
    "thus we see that the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing scheme has a significant impact on the decay widths for the processes @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , the quark mixing scheme predicts a large value for @xmath106 that is comparable to @xmath107 and is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "in this paper , the sum - rules describing @xmath18 exotic hybrid decays @xmath108 have been examined in two different @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing schemes .    in the singlet - octet scheme ,",
    "we reproduce the previous sum - rule results @xcite which find @xmath109 which differs from the experimentally observed decay pattern @xmath110 @xcite . by contrast , the quark mixing scheme results in a significant enhancement of the @xmath10 channel , leading to @xmath2 comparable to the experimental observations . however , we find a much smaller width in the @xmath111 channel ; @xmath112 and in general @xmath113 contrary to the experimental observation @xcite .    theoretical refinements extending our analysis beyond the symmetric momentum point and employing a more elaborate phenomenological model could be considered , but it seems unlikely that such refinements would generate a sufficiently large value of @xmath114 to accommodate the observed value",
    ". however , there exists evidence for a gluonic component in the @xmath4-@xmath5 system @xcite which would have an impact on our analysis , and could enhance the width of the @xmath115 channel .    further theoretical work and experimental confirmation of @xmath114 are necessary to reach a definitive conclusion , but the quark mixing scheme result @xmath116 comparable to the experimental value provides support for the quark @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing scheme rather than the singlet - octet approach .",
