    "<S> introduction. _ graphene under strain has been largely discussed in the literature and explored for different geometries , with particular features providing alternative routes to confine and control its charge carriers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significant development in the theoretical description of strained graphene elucidated how its electronic properties are modified on strained surfaces . at the microscopic level , </S>",
    "<S> a general deformation is described by modifications in the atomic positions which reflects in the hamiltonian as local changes in the hopping parameter  @xcite . in the continuum model </S>",
    "<S> these changes appear as an effective gauge field , and electrons with momentum around the dirac valleys move in the deformed region as in the presence of a pseudomagnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strain also produces a deformation potential , i.e. , a scalar field similar to a local chemical potential that can affect electron dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , measurements in high - quality graphene samples on particular substrates suggested a strong connection between random fluctuations in strain and transport properties  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of strain effects to engineer graphene electronic properties has also been explored in several experiments in the last years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as one of the most relevant findings , levy et al . were able to show the presence of pseudo landau levels generated by giant pseudomagnetic fields induced by homogeneous strain in graphene nanobubbles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental confirmation that strain can have striking effects on the electronic properties of graphene has been followed by other experiments that explore the effect of different geometries as a path to control graphene electromechanically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a generic deformation of a graphene sheet can cause _ inhomogeneous _ strain , which results in an effective non - uniform pseudomagnetic field and provides an experimental test - bed to explore the interplay between highly tunable magnetic fields and dirac fermions . </S>",

    "<S> these results indicate an incomplete understanding of the fundamental electronic properties of graphene samples where local manipulation produce effective inhomogeneous gauge and scalar fields .    </S>",

    "<S> we use a scattering formalism based on the continuum description of graphene to address the question of confinement of electrons due to this deformation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we calculate the ldos and show that a noticeable imbalance in the distribution of charge density between the two graphene nonequivalent sublattices appears even for small deformations , providing a possible explanation for the experimentally observed sublattice asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we perform exact numerical calculations and show that these results are well described within an analytical perturbative approach for small deformations . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dependence of the maximum ldos contrast between sublattices on energy and strain strength , providing a scaling dependence with the parameters of the deformation . </S>",

    "<S> for small deformations , we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation in the born approximation , and replace the scattering state @xmath42 on the right - hand side of the equation by the unperturbed state @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> note that our perturbative approach is valid for @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of the resulting scattering states is shown in the supplementary material@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the trigonal symmetry of the pseudomagnetic field underlies the coupling between angular momentum states differing by @xmath49 .    </S>",
