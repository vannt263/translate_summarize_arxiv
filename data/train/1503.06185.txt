    "recently there has been spectacular progress on exact solutions for strongly interacting stochastic particle systems in one spatial dimension",
    ". very roughly , these are two - dimensional field theories with some similarity to two - dimensional systems of equilibrium statistical mechanics and @xmath0 dimensional quantum field theories , including quantum spin chains . in these stochastic models the static correlations decay exponentially , but , because of conservation laws , the dynamic behavior shows non - trivial scaling properties .",
    "the physical interest in such models results from being representatives of huge universality classes .",
    "this is in direct analogy to the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "its exact solution is restricted to nearest neighbor couplings and zero external magnetic field .",
    "but the thereby predicted critical behavior is representative for a much larger class of models , including real two - dimensional ferromagnets to which , at first sight , the ising model would be a very crude approximation .",
    "our review attempts to answer `` what is currently known about the one - dimensional kadar - parisi - zhang equation ? '' .",
    "this will cover mathematically rigorous results , but also important conjectures and intriguing replica computations .",
    "in addition , we discuss discrete models which in a particular scaling limit converge to the kpz equation .",
    "they constitute the universality class of the kpz equation alluded to in the title .",
    "such models have been , and still are , an important tool to arrive at information on the kpz equation itself .",
    "our program has obvious disadvantages .",
    "it mostly ignores in which temporal order discoveries were made .",
    "it also misses largely the amazing progress on other models in the kpz universality class .",
    "fortunately there are excellent reviews available @xcite , which cover further aspects of the story .",
    "+ * 1.1 interface motion*. in our article we focus on the kpz universality class for growing fronts and interfaces in two - dimensional bulk systems . with the hindsight of theoretical activities over many years ,",
    "let us first recall the physical set - up under consideration .",
    "one considers a thin film , for which two bulk phases can be realized such that they are in contact along an interfacial curve .",
    "one of the phases is stable , while the other one is metastable with a very long life time .",
    "the dynamics of the bulk phases has no conservation laws and is rapidly space - time mixing .",
    "therefore , while fluctuating , the bulk phases are not changing in time and the only observable motion is at the interface , where the transition from metastable to stable is fast , while the reverse transition is very much suppressed . thereby the stable phase is expanding into the metastable one , accompanied by characteristic interfacial fluctuations .",
    "if both phases would be stable , then there is no net motion , and the interface fluctuations are of size @xmath1 with gaussian statistics on a sufficiently coarse scale . in the kpz set - up on the other hand , in the frame where the bulk phases are at rest",
    ", the interface has a non - zero net velocity and fluctuations are of size @xmath2 , a phenomenon known as kinetic roughening .",
    "there is no fine tuning of parameters .",
    "any asymmetry in the growth process will lead to the @xmath2 scaling .",
    "such motion comes with interfacial fluctuations which have non - gaussian statistics , hence the prime interest in exact solutions .",
    "the most prominent physical realization is a thin film of turbulent liquid crystal @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bulk phases are driven by a time oscillating , spatially uniform electric field , and thus not in thermal equilibrium . at a carefully chosen point in the phase diagram ,",
    "the dsm2 phase ( stable ) is coexisting with the dsm1 phase ( metastable ) . in the experiment , a point seed of the stable phase",
    "is planted in the bulk metastable phase and the growth of the dsm2 cluster is observed . in further series of experiments also",
    "the case of a stable line seed is realized .",
    "another example is eden cluster growth .",
    "here one starts from a point seed ( stable phase ) and randomly adds extra material to the surface of the already existing cluster .",
    "hence the metastable phase is just `` all empty '' and the precise ballistic deposition mechanism is not specified by the model . on a large scale ,",
    "the cluster has an approximately circular shape .",
    "but there are substantial shape fluctuations , which have the same statistics as observed for the turbulent liquid crystal @xcite .",

    "the arguable simplest model is the two - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model with glauber dynamics at zero temperature and a suitably scaled positive magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath10 phase is stable and the @xmath11 phase is metastable .",
    "we assume that the @xmath10 phase is bordered from above by a lattice height function , @xmath3 , which is a broken line with slope @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "the admissible growth sites are the local minima of @xmath13 , at which independently a @xmath11 spin flips to @xmath10 spin after an exponentially distributed waiting time , the reverse process occurring with a much smaller rate . in principle , clusters of the `` wrong '' sign could be spontaneously generated inside the bulk phases .",
    "but at low temperatures this is a very unlikely event and is completely suppressed at zero temperature .",
    "if instead of the height one considers the local slope with value @xmath14 , then the interface dynamics amounts to a random exchange of a neighboring @xmath15 pair , the reverse process being less likely .",
    "this markov jump process does not satisfy detailed balance , which is one reason for the unexpected dynamical behavior .",
    "the one - sided growth limit , @xmath16 , is known as tasep , which has been a useful tool in obtaining exact solutions , see @xcite .",
    "kardar , parisi , and zhang @xcite pose the same question , but proceed along a very different route , motivated by the ginzburg - landau theory of critical dynamics .",
    "firstly , on a mesoscopic scale the interface is modeled as the graph of a height function @xmath17 with time @xmath18 and space @xmath19 . in the case of contact between two",
    "stable phases one writes down the langevin equation @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the surface tension and @xmath22 is a noise term of strength @xmath23 describing the random back and forth between the two phases .",
    "@xmath24 is modeled as space - time white noise , which is gaussian with mean zero and covariance @xmath25 on the basis of ( [ 1.1 ] ) one finds that , if initially flat , the interface develops fluctuations of size @xmath1 .    on the other hand , if the interface is stable - metastable ,",
    "the net motion is modeled by adding to ( [ 1.1 ] ) a nonlinear drift , which is allowed to depend only on @xmath26 so to maintain the invariance under the global shift of @xmath13 to @xmath27 . for isotropic growth in the plane the nonlinearity can be easily guessed . if locally there is a linear piece , @xmath28 , then @xmath29 with @xmath30 the asymptotic radial growth velocity .",
    "the precise form of the nonlinearity should not matter on large scales and , expanding at @xmath31 , one arrives at the one - dimensional kpz equation @xmath32 with @xmath33 . in principle",

    "still we expand the exponential and carry out the brownian motion average with the result @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the time - ordered multi - time transition probability of brownian motion .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) is a multiple stochastic integral , and we choose the forward ( it ) discretization in every @xmath54",
    ". then each summand of ( [ 1.6 ] ) is a well defined random variable , the sum converges in @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "we thus _ define _ the ( cole - hopf ) solution to the kpz equation as @xmath57 while the sum seems to be useful only for studying the short time behavior of the solution , it does provide us with a well - defined starting point .",
    "the singular structure of the kpz equation comes from insisting on spatial white noise . if one would replace @xmath24 by the smoothed version @xmath58 with @xmath59 , even , smooth , of rapid decay at infinity , and normalized to @xmath60 , then the solution to is well - defined and given by with the random partition function as defined in .",
    "we now introduce an ultraviolet cut - off of size @xmath61 by choosing the @xmath62-function sequence @xmath63 and substituting the noise @xmath64 by its smoothed version @xmath65 .",
    "such solution is denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "as established some time ago @xcite , in the limit @xmath67 one recovers the cole - hopf solution , provided one switches to a moving frame as @xmath68 with velocity @xmath69 diverging in the limit . in field theory language",
    "this amounts to an infinite energy renormalization as familiar from @xmath70 quantum field theory .    in this context hairer",

    "the height of the interface , the object of physical interest , is simply the ( random ) free energy . to leading order",
    "it is proportional to @xmath74 , which corresponds to the non - random displacement of the height .",

    "this is the scale in which one observes the non - trivial fluctuation behavior throughout the kpz universality class . as to be noted , to extract from the kpz equation universal , model independent properties one still has to study its long time limit .    to be more precise than their size",
