    "let us consider a classical gas system of hard - sphere particles .",
    "an important quantity , crucial for the description of all transport properties of this system , is the particle mean - free path estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the particle number density and @xmath4 is the hard - core particle diameter .",
    "this is an internal property of the equilibrium system . for external ( dynamical ) perturbations",
    ", one has to introduce another scale @xmath8 which is the size of the space region where the gas properties ( e.g. , temperature , mean particle density , and collective velocity ) undergo essential changes .",
    "usually , the inequality , @xmath9 , is satisfied .",
    "this corresponds to the so called frequent collision regime ( fcr ) , and the transport coefficients can be calculated as a perturbation expansion over a small parameter @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the leading terms of these expansions are found to be independent of the scale @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the shear viscosity @xmath0 , calculated by maxwell within concepts of the molecular kinetic theory , reads @xmath11 , where @xmath3 is the particle mass and @xmath12 is the thermal particle velocity . ] .",
    "thus , in the fcr , @xmath0 is a function of only internal parameters of the equilibrium gas .",
    "since @xmath13 , one finds @xmath14 in the fcr , i.e. , the shear viscosity is independent of particle number density at the leading order in @xmath10 .",
    "similar results are valid for other transport coefficients in the fcr .",
    "accurate expressions for the transport coefficients in a gas of classical hard - sphere particles were obtained by chapman and enskog ( ce ) by using the boltzmann kinetic equation ( bke ) and ideal hydrodynamic equations for calculations of a time evolution in terms of almost the local - equilibrium distribution function within the fcr @xcite .",
    "the following expression for @xmath0 was obtained @xcite : etace _",

    "several investigations were devoted to go beyond the standard approach ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath0 was calculated for a gas of particles with both the short - range repulsive and long - range attractive interactions described by the van der waals equation of state @xcite .",
    "this was realized within the fcr in terms of a strong suppression of the damping plane waves .",
    "many theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations were devoted to a weak absorption of the sound wave in dilute gases .",
    "for the sound absorption coefficient @xmath15 , one can use the famous stokes expression in terms of the viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "most results for the absorption coefficient @xmath15 were also obtained in the fcr .",
    "much less attention was paid to the rare collision regime ( rcr ) which takes place at @xmath16 ; i.e. , the so called knudsen parameter , @xmath10 , becomes large ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the conditions of the rcr can be fulfilled in different ways . for a small particle number density ,",
    "a typical rcr situation arises because of the finite system size .",
    "note that for @xmath17 the mean - free path behaves as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ etace ] ) fails for any finite physical system in the limits , @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 , where a density and/or a diameter of particles is vanishing . in both these limits , one has @xmath21 and , thus , one results in the relationship @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the fcr is transformed to the rcr ; and eq .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a general perturbation method which can be applied for both the fcr and the rcr for the weakly absorbed plane waves ( apw ) .",
    "the fcr and rcr can be defined in alternative terms .",
    "let us consider the sound plane - wave propagation in the infinite gas system . in this case , different regimes take place because of different relationships between the mean - free path @xmath22 and the wavelength @xmath23 of the propagating plane wave : @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the fcr and rcr , respectively @xcite .",
    "introducing the wave frequency @xmath5 and frequency of two - particle collisions @xmath26 , one finds another equivalent classification for different collision regimes ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 corresponds to the fcr , and @xmath29 to the rcr . a dimensionless quantity @xmath30 plays the same role as the knudsen parameter mentioned above .",
    "small ( large ) values of @xmath30 correspond to the collision - term ( inertial - terms ) dominance in the bke . in the fcr",
    "we may use the perturbation expansion in power series over @xmath30 whereas in the rcr the parameter @xmath30 becomes large , and the perturbation expansion over @xmath31 should be successful . therefore , in these two collision regimes , one can expect a different dependence of @xmath0 on the equilibrium gas parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and proper particle parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
