    "models for new physics at the tev scale are typically motivated by the hierarchy problem .",
    "they strive to explain the hierarchy between the electroweak ( ew ) scale and the planck scale , or at least remove the incredible fine tuning required in the standard model ( sm ) for having such a hierarchy .",
    "however , the sm is stubbornly surviving the first tests at the lhc and there are no traces of new physics yet .",
    "in addition , the mass of the recently discovered higgs - like particle suggests that the sm can be a consistent theory all the way to the planck scale .",
    "this gives more weight to speculations that there is no mechanism , no new physics , that stabilizes the hierarchy , or that the ew scale is selected based on anthropic reasoning .",
    "however , even when we ignore the hierarchy problem , the sm is still not very satisfactory .",
    "the three gauge couplings , all couplings of the higgs boson to fermions , the higgs mass , and the higgs quartic coupling are free parameters .",
    "this motivates us to explore extensions of the standard model in which at least some of these parameters could be understood .",
    "we have recently showed that extending the standard model by three complete vector - like families ( sm+3vfs ) with masses of order 1 tev - 100 tev allows for the unification of gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "predictions for gauge couplings at the ew scale are highly insensitive to fundamental parameters : the grand unification scale , the unified gauge coupling , and the masses of vector - like fermions .",
    "their observed values can be mostly understood from infrared fixed point behavior .    in this paper",
    "we discuss gauge coupling unification in detail in models with additional 1 to 4 complete vector - like families ( vfs ) , and derive simple rules for masses of vector - like fermions required for exact gauge coupling unification .",
    "we then focus on scenarios with 3 or more vector - like families that lead to insensitive unification of gauge couplings . requiring the smallest splitting between masses of vector - like fermions",
    "we show that the best motivated grand unified theory ( gut ) scale is at @xmath0@xmath1 gev .",
    "we provide examples of the spectrum as a function of the gut scale , which can be as large as the planck scale .",
    "we discuss constraints from proton decay and show that predictions from the best motivated region are close to current limits . however , due to insensitivity of predicted ew scale values of gauge couplings to gut scale parameters , no sharp predictions can be made without knowing the spectrum of vector - like fermions .",
    "the focus on complete families follows from the fact that quantum numbers of quarks and leptons in the sm nicely fill representations of a gut symmetry , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath4 or @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "this provides a support for the idea of grand unification and the unification of gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "additional complete families represent some of the simplest extensions of the sm that can be embedded into simple guts .",
    "consequently , there are many studies exploring various features of vector - like families ( mostly in supersymmetric models ) , see for example refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , vector - like fermions , not necessarily coming in complete gut multiplets , are often introduced on purely phenomenological grounds to explain various discrepancies between observations and sm predictions .",
    "examples include discrepancies in precision ew z - pole observables  @xcite , and the muon g-2 anomaly  @xcite .",
    "however , with arbitrary new particles there are many possibilities for gauge coupling unification .",
    "therefore , we generalize the mass rules and the method to classify scenarios consistent with gauge coupling unification to an arbitrary extension of the standard model .    the method to classify scenarios consistent with gauge coupling unification in terms of physical masses of extra particles starts with finding the mass scales that represent  average \" masses of all particles charged under given gauge symmetry required for gauge coupling unification ( they are defined precisely in the next section and are referred to as crossing scales ) .",
    "these crossing scales are easy to obtain and they immediately give us information about the required spectrum .",
    "first of all , if they do not exist between the ew scale and the gut scale , the gauge coupling unification in a given model is not possible , no matter what the splitting between masses of extra particles is .",
    "second , the splitting between crossing scales represents the minimum necessary splitting in the spectrum required .",
    "third , from the mass formulas that define crossing scales in terms of masses of extra particles one can immediately see the basic features of the spectrum required , and the spectrum can be calculated .",
    "in addition , these formulas also indicate the freedom one has in imposing further relations between masses of extra particles",
    ". this might be useful when searching for models that relate masses of particles at a given scale .",
    "the mass rules given in terms of particle masses can be evolved to an arbitrary scale , _",
    "e.g. _ the gut scale , which would provide the boundary conditions that need to be satisfied . however , the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the mass rules depends on additional assumptions one has to make about the origin of the masses and the scale at which these masses are generated .",

    "[ sec : rge ] we discuss rg evolution of gauge couplings in models with extra vfs .",

    "this procedure can be repeated for any @xmath47 and @xmath38 , or the solutions can be plotted as functions of these variables .",
    "so far , we have only considered constraints on the gut scale and masses of vector - like fermions from gauge coupling unification . in order for this scenario to be easily embedded into simple grand unified theories , based on @xmath4 or @xmath6 , the constraints on proton lifetime and the stability of the ew minimum of the higgs potential should be satisfied .",
    "the most stringent limits on proton lifetime come from super - kamiokande . for the dominant decay mode from dimension-6 operators ,",
    "the limit is @xmath139 yrs  @xcite .",
    "assuming naively , that the proton lifetime is @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the mass of the proton , this limit translates into the lower bound on the gut scale : @xmath142 gev for @xmath21 which we use in our examples .",
    "however , the prediction for the proton lifetime is somewhat model dependent ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and so we do not impose the strict limit in the plots we present . in addition , the plots would look very similar for any large value of @xmath47 , but the limits would differ .",
    "the interested reader can easily impose the limit on any scenario by simple rescaling of the mentioned limit using the formula for the proton lifetime .",
    "it is interesting to note that the best motivated value of the gut scale is in the @xmath0@xmath1  gev range which is basically at the current limit .",
    "it is , however , not possible to make precise predictions without knowing the masses of vector - like fermions .",
    "for example , a scenario with the gut scale larger by a factor of 3 results in @xmath02 orders of magnitude enhancement of the proton lifetime but would only require modest changes in the spectrum of vector - like fermions in order to have exact gauge coupling unification .",
    "this inability to make precise predictions of gut scale parameters is a direct consequence of the insensitivity of the ew scale couplings to gut scale boundary conditions .",
    "the rg evolution of the top yukawa and higgs quartic couplings in the sm+3vfs for @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 was given in ref .",
    "the higgs quartic coupling remains positive all the way to the gut scale , and thus the electroweak minimum of the higgs potential is stable .",
    "this result holds in a large range of @xmath38 and @xmath47 , especially in the best motivated region .",
    "therefore , these scenarios represent some of the simplest possible extensions of the standard model that can be embedded into grand unified theories , with a sufficiently long lived proton , and a stable ew minimum of the higgs potential .",
    "we have not investigated the origin of masses of vector - like fermions needed for gauge coupling unification .",
    "this would require additional assumptions about the mechanism that generates them and the scale at which boundary conditions are set .",
    "the masses of vector - like fermions may be fundamental lagrangian parameters , or they can originate from yukawa couplings to one or several additional scalars ( singlets under sm gauge symmetry , but possibly charged under family symmetries ) that acquire vacuum expectation values at any scale between the gut scale and the @xmath23 scale .",
    "in addition , vector - like fermions can have non - zero yukawa couplings to the sm higgs doublet , which add another layer of complexity by contributing to the physical masses and possibly significantly affecting the rg evolution of other parameters that directly determine their masses .",
    "the study of gauge coupling unification is , to a large extent , unaffected by these assumptions , only the physical masses of particles matter in the leading order .",
    "fundamental lagrangian masses would not affect the running of gauge couplings at all , and the yukawa couplings to extra scalars may only contribute to the rg evolution of gauge couplings at 2-loop level .",
    "however , in any specific scenario , the mass rules ( [ eq : m3rule ] ) - ( [ eq : m1rule ] ) can be evolved to the gut scale ( or other relevant scale ) , and the freedom to choose some of the masses can be used to search for simple boundary conditions that are consistent with gauge coupling unification .    finally , it is intriguing to consider a connection with the anthropic solution to the hierarchy problem , or the ew scale  @xcite . adding vfs to the sm",
    "makes this possibility more appealing , since in the sm , special values of gauge couplings either at the ew scale or some high scale have to be selected . in scenarios that we discussed , the ew scale values of gauge couplings close to the observed values are not very special , but rather quite a generic outcome from large ranges of fundamental parameters . for example , in the sm+3vfs case , as far as @xmath145 tev , for any @xmath146 , and @xmath38 anywhere between @xmath147 gev and the planck scale , the predicted values of gauge coupling at the ew scale are always within 50% of the measured values",
    "( @xmath89 typically well within 20% ) .",
    "this is indicated by the lightly shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_g_vs_m_vf_3vf ] , and a similar region is indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : m_g_vs_m_vf_4vf ] for sm+4vfs .",
    "furthermore , if the ew scale and @xmath23 have the same origin , it would also explain the proximity of the qcd scale to the ew scale .",
    "the beta function of @xmath53 changes the sign at @xmath23 , and below this scale , it starts running fast toward @xmath148 .",
    "we have discussed gauge coupling unification in models with additional 1 to 4 complete vector - like families . in scenarios with 3 or more vector - like families",
    "the values of gauge couplings at the electroweak scale are highly insensitive to the grand unification scale , the unified gauge coupling , and the masses of vector - like fermions .",
    "their observed values can be mostly understood from infrared fixed point behavior . starting with a large ( but still perturbative ) unified gauge coupling at a high scale ,",
    "the values of gauge couplings at lower energies are determined only by the particle content of the theory and how far from the gut scale we measure them . since the exact value of @xmath47 becomes irrelevant , instead of one prediction of the conventional unification , we have two predictions for ratios of gauge couplings .",
    "these predictions are modified at the @xmath46 scale , where the vector - like fermions are integrated out , and below this scale , gauge couplings run according to the usual rg equations of the standard model .",
    "assuming first a common mass of vector - like fermions , @xmath23 , we showed predictions for three gauge couplings at the ew scale as functions of @xmath38 and @xmath23 .",
    "we found that the observed values of gauge coupling are reproduced with good precision from a large range of parameters .",
    "especially , @xmath38 can be varied over several orders of magnitude while having all three gauge couplings within 20% from observed values .",
    "the best fit , which predicts all three couplings within 6% from measured values , suggests @xmath149 gev , @xmath101 gev in the case of sm+3vfs , and @xmath150 gev in the case of sm+4vfs .    the best motivated gut scale , @xmath0@xmath1 gev , predicts a proton lifetime close to current limits .",
    "however , due to insensitivity of the predicted ew scale values of gauge couplings to gut scale parameters , no sharp predictions can be made without knowing the spectrum of vector - like fermions .",
    "in addition , it was previously shown that the higgs quartic coupling remains positive all the way to the gut scale , and thus the electroweak minimum of the higgs potential is stable .",
    "this result holds in a large range of @xmath38 and @xmath47 , especially in the best motivated region .",
    "therefore , these scenarios represent some of the simplest possible extensions of the standard model that can be embedded into grand unified theories , with a sufficiently long lived proton , and the stable ew minimum of the higgs potential .",
    "the discrepancies of ir fixed point predictions from observed values can be explained by threshold effects of extra vector - like fermions .",
    "we showed examples of the spectrum for the gut scale varied between @xmath147 gev and @xmath151 gev .",
    "we derived simple rules for masses of vector - like fermions required for exact gauge coupling unification .",
    "in addition , we generalized the mass rules and the method of using crossing scales of evolutions of gauge couplings in the sm and the given extension to classify scenarios consistent with gauge coupling unification to an arbitrary extension of the standard model .",
    "the problem of finding all possible mass spectra in a given model consistent with gauge coupling unification is reduced to solving a set of simple algebraic equations that masses of extra particles have to satisfy .",
    "with respect to the sensitivity to fundamental parameters , the model with 3 extra vector - like families stands out . in the best motivated region , it requires vector - like fermions with masses of order 1 tev  100 tev , and thus at least part of the spectrum may be within the reach of the lhc .",
    "notably , quark doublets , @xmath10 , are typically predicted at @xmath01 tev .",
    "however , only geometric means of masses of particles with the same quantum numbers are constrained by gauge coupling unification .",

    ", it may be also possible to observe their effects in a variety of processes .",
    "however , they typically affect standard model predictions only through mixing with light fermions , which is highly model dependent .",
