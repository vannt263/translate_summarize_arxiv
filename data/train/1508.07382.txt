    "the interplay between quantum information theory and statistical mechanics has brought emerging connections between these research fields  @xcite . in particular , it has provided a deeper understanding about the role played by correlations in quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) . a seminal result in this direction is a link between the scaling of pairwise entanglement and qpts in quantum spin chains  @xcite .",
    "this has been further developed by introducing a distinction between the characterization of first - order and continuous qpts  @xcite .",
    "for a block analysis , entanglement entropy has been found to be related to the central charge of the virasoro algebra associated with the conformal field theory behind the critical model  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it has been shown that quantum correlation measures such as provided by the quantum discord  @xcite are also able to identify quantum criticality  @xcite . remarkably",
    ", pairwise quantum discord may exhibit a more robust characterization of qpts than pairwise entanglement in certain cases .",
    "for instance , pairwise quantum discord between distant sites in a quantum chain may indicate a quantum critical point , while entanglement is absent already for very short distances  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for finite temperatures , pairwise quantum discord is able to reveal the qpt by non - analyticities in its derivatives , while the pronounced behavior in two - qubit entanglement disappears for even small temperatures  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim at investigating the behavior of the local quantum uncertainty ( lqu )  @xcite at quantum criticality .",
    "the lqu has been introduced as a quantum discord - like measure , which is primarily related with the skew information  @xcite . in particular , it plays a role in the characterization of quantum metrology protocols  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of lqu between pairs of spins in a quantum spin chain has been recently considered  @xcite . here",
    ", we generalize this previous analysis for systems of dimension @xmath2 by considering the lqu for blocks of arbitrary dimension @xmath3 and also by discussing its finite - size behavior in both first - order and second - order qpts . more specifically , we will evaluate the lqu between a block of @xmath0 quantum bits ( qubits ) and one single qubit in a composite system of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "for a first - order qpt , we will consider a hamiltonian implementation of the quantum search , which is designed to find out a marked element in an unstructured search space of @xmath4 elements . by analytical evaluation",
    ", we will show that the lqu exponentially saturates to a constant value at the critical point as we increase the block length @xmath0 .",
    "this saturation is found to be enhanced by the system size @xmath1 . on the other hand , at non - critical points , the lqu will be shown to vanish for large @xmath1 . in the case of second - order qpts , we consider the transverse - field ising model with open boundary conditions . by implementing a numerical analysis via density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    ", we will show that the concavity of the lqu as a function of the block size @xmath0 characterizes the qpt .",
    "for both first - order and second - order qpts , we also consider the lqu as a function of the coupling parameter , showing that the lqu exhibits a pronounced behavior at the quantum critical point independently of the block sizes of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "in particular , this pronounced behavior is sensitive to @xmath1 , showing a scaling behavior as we increase the size of the system .",
    "the uncertainty of an observable @xmath5 in a quantum state @xmath6 is usually quantified by the variance @xmath7 .",
    "it may exhibit contributions from both quantum and classical sources .",
    "quantum uncertainty comes from the noncommutativity between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , being quantified by the skew ( not commuting ) information  @xcite @xmath8 indeed , suppose @xmath6 and @xmath5 commute .",
    "then , @xmath6 and @xmath5 have a common basis of eigenstates @xmath9 , which means that the uncertainty of @xmath5 in an individual eigenstate @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "hence , a nonvanishing uncertainty @xmath11 is only possible if @xmath6 is a classical mixing of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the commutation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 implies that @xmath11 has a classical origin .",
    "the quantum uncertainty is intrinsically connected with the concept of quantum correlation .",
    "for example , let us consider a bell state of two qubits , namely , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the computational basis .",
    "this is an eigenstate of the global observable @xmath14 , so there is no uncertainty on the result of a measurement of such an observable . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of local spin observables is intrinsically uncertain for the density operator @xmath15 , since an entangled state can not be an eigenstate of a local observable .",
    "in particular , the variance @xmath11 for a local observable @xmath5 will vanish if and only if the state is uncorrelated .",
    "the concept of quantum uncertainty can be extended to mixed states . in this case",
    ", the skew information @xmath16 vanishes if and only if @xmath6 is not disturbed by the measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a local observable , the states left invariant by local measurement are the states with zero quantum discord with respect to that local subsystem  @xcite .",
    "the quantum uncertainty on local observables is then intimately related to the notion of quantum discord and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be used as a discord - like quantifier .",
    "we are now ready to define the local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be the state of a bipartite system , and let @xmath18 denote a local observable on @xmath19 ( @xmath5 is represented by a hermitian operator on @xmath19 with nondegenerate spectrum @xmath20 ) .",

    "the size @xmath0 of the block @xmath29 is arbitrarily chosen and subsystem @xmath19 is taken as one qubit . ]",
    "the aim of the search problem is to find out a marked element in an unstructured list of @xmath30 candidates . in a quantum setting , it is possible to solve the search problem with scaling @xmath31 , as proved by grover  @xcite . here , we consider a hamiltonian implementation through a quantum system composed of @xmath1 qubits , whose hilbert space has dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the computational basis by the set @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume an oracular model such that the marked element is the state @xmath34 .",
    "so the implementation of the quantum search can be achieved through the projective hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the normalized time @xmath38 . by preparing the system in its ground state at time @xmath39 and by considering an adiabatic dynamics , it evolves to the corresponding instantaneous ground state at later times .",
