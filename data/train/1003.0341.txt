    "the dynamical processes taking place in a supercooled liquid are complex .",

    "when the liquid enters this ultra - viscous regime @xcite , the rearrangement of a particle involves the motion of many of its neighbors . the idea that the dynamics becomes more and more cooperative has led to searches for a growing length scale as the dynamics slow - down upon cooling .",

    "the studies carried out by our group focused on the temperature - dependence of the the shear - mechanical and dielectric @xmath16 relaxation times ( indicated with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) . furthermore , comparison of the shape of these two relaxation functions was presented .",
    "the main conclusions of these studies may be summarized as follows :    ( _ i _ ) the relaxation time of the shear modulus is generally different from that of the dielectric susceptibility at the same temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the shear - mechanical relaxation is always slightly faster than the dielectric , @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , the shear and dielectric characteristic alpha relaxation times evolve in a rather similar way in the liquids studied when @xmath19 is changed .",
