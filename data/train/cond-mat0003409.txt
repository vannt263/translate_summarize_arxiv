    "<S> in order to describe the recently observed effect of current induced magnetization reversal in magnetic nanostructures , the thermokinetic theory is applied to a metallic ferromagnet in contact with a reservoir of spin polarized conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the spin flip relaxation of the conduction electrons is described thermodynamically as a chemical reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion equation of the chemical potential ( or the giant magnetoresistance ) and the usual landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation are derived from the entropy variation . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of the conservation laws of the magnetic moments , including spin dependent scattering processes , leads then to the generalized llg equation with spin polarized current . </S>",

    "<S> an unexpected and spectacular effect due to spin polarization of conduction electrons in metallic ferromagnets , the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) , appeared with the first transport studies on magnetic nanostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin diffusion length of conduction electrons being of some few tens of nm , the relaxation of the conduction electron spins becomes observable when the magnetization can be controlled over this typical length . </S>",
    "<S> some predictions about the inverse effect , namely the influence of spin polarized current on the dynamics of the magnetization , were also proposed . </S>",
    "<S> berger predicted the existence of some surprising phenomena due to the action of spin polarized conduction electrons on domain walls @xcite or spin waves @xcite in magnetic thin films . </S>",

    "<S> the ballistic approximation is however difficult to justify in all these experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> a phenomenological approach based on the thermokinetic theory @xcite , @xcite of a metallic ferromagnet in contact with a reservoir of spin polarized conduction electrons is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the pioneering works of johnson and silsbee @xcite on spin polarized current , the spin - flip scattering is introduced here as a chemical reaction . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation allows the conservation laws of the spin polarized conduction electrons and the ferromagnetic order parameter to be treated ( section i ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological approach models the different effects able to take place in the system by a set of coupled transport equations ( section ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differential equation of the chemical potential is derived leading to the known formula of the gmr ( section iii ) . for a closed ferromagnetic system without electric current , </S>",
    "<S> the common landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation is derived ( section iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the open system with both ferromagnetization and spin polarized conduction electrons leads to the description of the generalized landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation with polarized current ( section v ) . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences in terms of current - induced magnetization reversal are deduced . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied on the data obtained on ni nanowires . </S>"
