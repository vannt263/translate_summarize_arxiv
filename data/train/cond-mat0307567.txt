    "thermodynamics provides an excellent macroscopic description of the physics of matter in terms of time - independent averaged quantities such as energy , entropy , free energy .",
    "these arise from the underlying microscopic , time - dependent motions of atoms .",
    "the two descriptions are unified through statistical mechanics , and therefore contain the same information , but in in the absence of atomic - level detail the thermodynamic picture is far more useful for everyday application .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether ecosystems can similarly be described by macroscopic averages rather than details of individual species .",
    "recent work has suggested that the principle of maximum entropy production ( mep ) may be a good way to investigate complex , self organising systems .",
    "lorenz et al ( 2001,2002 ) suggest that the atmosphere of earth and titan may be in such a state .",
    "dewar ( 2003 ) has shown that other known distributions of open , dynamical systems , such as self - organised criticality ( bak et al , 1988 ) , the fluctuation theorem ( crooks , 1999 ) and zipf s law ( zipf 1932 ) .",
    "the basis of dewar s argument is that if one takes an appropriate average over all its internal possibilities , consistent with the known fluxes and internal energies , mep will emerge .",
    "of course , real systems do not actually sample all possibilities , so this only provides a sufficient conditions for mep , the necessary condition is that the average over possibilities actually observed converges rapidly .",
    "this parallels an argument in equilibrium statistical mechanics , where thermodynamic averages are calculated from an ergodic hypothesis ( that all microstates contribute according to boltzmann statistics ) to which the chaotic trajectories of real systems rapidly converge .",
    "boltzmann statistics follow from hamiltonian dynamics . in the case of ecological systems ,",
    "the dynamics are driven by evolution , and no proof of convergence of an evolving system to a boltzmann - type distribution yet exists .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether more general principles , such as mep , can be applied in an ecological context . in this paper",
    "we explore a particular ecological model , 2d - daisyworld , in which the mep state can be rigorously defined , to see whether the system does , in fact , self - organise thereto .",
    "the 2d - daisyworld , is based on previous work ( von bloh et al .",
    ", 1997,1999 , ackland et al 2003 ) .",
    "life is reduced to a single species daisies with a single property ( albedo ) upon which selection can act .",
    "the local environment is reduced to a single variable temperature .",
    "the planet is warmed by a sun whose heat production ( insolation ) increases slowly .",
    "growth is only possible across a narrow range of temperatures ( 5 - 40@xmath0c ) with the mid point 22.5@xmath0c being optimal and the growth rate dropping parabolically to zero at the extremes .",
    "local temperature is partly determined by insolation and albedo and partly by diffusive heat flow across the planet .",
    "growth occurs by seeding of bare ground adjacent to existing daisy populations , eliminating the need in the original , zero - dimensional daisyworld of watson and lovelock , ( 1983 ) to predefine different local environments for different albedo types .",
    "each ( asexual ) offspring mutates in albedo at random .",
    "the original daisyworld is deterministic , cast in the form of differential equations , and has spawned many variants to incorporate specific evolutionary dynamics or natural selection ( lenton , 1998 , lenton and lovelock 2000 , lovelock 1998 , robertson and robinson , 1998 , staley 2002 , sugimoto , 2002 ) .",
    "the 2d version is stochastic , with many internal degrees of freedom , allowing an entropy production to be defined by the range of albedo ( called biodiversity ) , as well as through heat flow .",
    "historically , daisyworlds were designed to illustrate the self - regulating effects of coupling between life and the environment , and their impact on evolution by group selection .",
    "this is not the issue of interest here - daisyworld is used as a test case for mep .",
    "the temperature field changes as :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the heat capacity , t the temperature field , @xmath3 the thermal diffusion constant @xmath4 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath5 , the insolation normalised to that which gives t=295.5k on a bare planet and @xmath6 the albedo field ( daisy / bare ground ) .",
    "each lattice point has an associated temperature and albedo . @xmath6",
    "ranges from 0 to 1 , with 0.5 being the value for bare ground .",
    "the daisy field is discrete and evolves stochastically .",
    "we use a square lattice with eight neighbouring sites . at each time",
    "step each site is examined and :    \\(1 ) if occupied by a daisy , it changes to bare ground with probability @xmath7 ( the `` death rate '' ) .",
    "\\(2 ) if occupied by bare ground , the site is populated with probability @xmath8 ( the `` growth rate '' ) .",
    "the new daisy has the albedo of its parent , from a randomly chosen neighbouring site , with a random fluctuation ( mutation ) drawn from a uniform distribution between r and -r .",
    "if the neighbouring site is bare , no growth occurs .",
    "two global principles will be advanced , these are not new , but formal definitions for the present system are made .",
    "1/ maximal entropy production ( dewar , 2003 ) - the system self organises to produce entropy as rapidly as possible    2/ the gaia principle ( lovelock , 1998 ) - the system self organises to maximise the amount of life    in previous work on the 2d case ( ackland et al 2003 ) , it was shown that multiple solutions satisfied the gaia principle .",
    "a secondary criterion was found , maximisation of biodiversity entropy @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of daisies with albedo a , leading to a mean distribution    @xmath11    with @xmath12 given by the solution of :    @xmath13    thus the global state of 2d daisyworld was classified in terms of two quantities , maximised growth ( i.e. temperature regulation at the favoured growth temperature ) and maximised biodiversity .",
    "these are equivalent to satisfying both mep and gaia principles simultaneously .",
    "it is possible to make a small change to the 2d daisyworld so that gaia and mep can not be satisfied simultaneously . to do this",
    "simply requires making the death rate temperature dependent , and the temperature for minimum death rate ( @xmath14 ) different from that for maximum birthrate ( @xmath15 ) . in this case",
    "the mep will predict that the temperature will adjust close to @xmath15 , while the gaia hypothesis predicts it will adjust close to @xmath14 .",
    "the explanation for this is straightforward : mep predicts that entropy ( biodiversity ) be produced at the fastest possible rate : maximising the birthrate . by contrast , the gaia hypothesis is that the total number of daisies be maximised : minimising deathrate . thus investigating whether the mean temperature tends to @xmath15 or @xmath14 determines which ( if either ) of the two hypotheses applies .",
    "figure.[fig:2d2 ] shows the variation of mean temperature and population as a function of insolation : the mean temperature obtained is @xmath14 and the population is @xmath16 .",
    "thus we conclude that the dynamics satisfy gaia rather than mep .",
    "the arguments above pertain to biodiversity entropy . with a finite diffusivity",
    ", one can also investigate whether the mep can be applied to entropy production by heatflow in daisyworld .",
    "there are conceptual difficulties with defining the system here - the models for mep on earth ( ozawa et al , 2003 ) , and dewar s ( 2002 ) formulation assume constant flows of energy into and out of the system ; the self - organising albedo of daisyworld is able to regulate these flows .",
    "similarly , the diffusion constant is fixed in 2d - daisyworld , whereas in atmospheric models it is assumed to self adjust . notwithstanding this ,",
    "there is a range of temperatures in 2d daisyworld , and heat is transported from hotter to colder regions , so we can define thermal entropy production as    @xmath17    given the constraints on flow , it is not straightforward to determine the maximum possible entropy production . however , after an abrupt change in the external forcing ( insolation ) the system will be out of equilibrium , and will then evolve towards a steady state . if mep holds , the state immediately after the change should have lower entropy production than the steady state .",
    "figure [ fig : entropy ] shows no sign of such behaviour .",
    "monitoring entropy production also enables us to monitor another property , the net heat flow in and out of the system . in steady state",
    ", the mean values of these heat flows should be equal - in 0d daisyworlds solutions initially assumed input and output were in balance at all times - this is not required for a nonlinear system , but proof of the stability of these solutions came later ( saunders , 1994 ) . in the 2d - daisyworld figure [ fig : ebalance ] shows the time variation of flow in and flow out .",
    "an interesting feature here is that flow in ( basically albedo ) fluctuates much faster than flow out ( basically temperature ) , which also has a delayed response of many daisy lifetimes",
    ".    observations of planetary mep are presumed to indicate that large - scale atmospheric heat transfer mechanisms are self - organising . however , even in the curved - planet version of 2d - daisyworld ( ackland et al , 2003 ) , very strong temperature regulation eliminates large scale temperature variation and hence the driving force for the atmosphere ( except in the case of desert formation ) .",
    "figure [ fig : entropy ] shows that the mean heat entropy produced per cell does not tend to a maximum during equilibration after a sharp change in insolation .",
    "we this conclude that no mep principle applies to heatflow in 2d daisyworld .",
    "we examined whether there was an optimum value for the diffusion constant d : at given s , heat entropy is largely independent of d. this is non - trivial , since it implies that for high d temperature variations are suppressed precisely enough to compensate for the increased diffusion constant .",
    "however , it indicates that even if d could be optimised by a hypothetical daisyworld atmosphere , in the presence of strong temperature regulation no detectable maximum entropy producing value of d exists .",
    "in watson and lovelock s ( 1983 ) 0d daisyworld two daisy albedos exist , denoted by suffices b and w , with albedo @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the relevant equations are :    change of fractional areas occupied by each daisy type ( set to zero at equilibrium )    @xmath20    fraction of free surface for growth    @xmath21    growth rates for daisies .",
    "@xmath22    mean planetary albedo ( reflectivity )    @xmath23    local temperatures over daisyfields    @xmath24    one further equation closes the set - this represents the equality of absorbed and emitted heat , as we saw in the 2d case , this equality strictly should be considered as a time average , however if we assume that no variable large heat reservoirs ( e.g. icecaps ) exist the timescales are such that the following equality holds :    @xmath25    s being an insolation , l a variable of order unity , and emitted by stefan - boltzmann radiation .",
    "the usual conclusion from this model is that the daisies moderate the temperature , however the graph of t @xmath26 l ( figure [ fig:0d2]a ) : shows that @xmath27 is not optimised to the optimum for growth .",
    "in contrast , a plot of x @xmath26 l ( figure [ fig:0d2]b ) shows that x is a minimum for all l.    the daisyworld equations can be solved analytically .",
    "the solutions fall into four independent classes : no daisies , black - only , white - only , both types . at a given insolation only one `` living ''",
    "solution is stable if the simulation is started with non - zero concentration of both daisy types .",
    "dead and living solutions coexist in regions where the dead planet temperature lies outside the limits for growth ( 5 - 40@xmath0c ) .",
    "the stable solutions ( fig.[fig:0d2 ] ) have been found dynamically , ( iterating equations [ d1]-[d6 ] to self consistency ) by numerous authors .",
    "the important point here is that the _ stable _ solution can be determined by minimisation of @xmath28 among allowed solutions .",
    "adopting the lowest @xmath28 is the 0d equivalent to the gaian principle of maximum life , as found in the 2d case .    as a further test",
    ", we introduce a third daisy species ( grey ) with albedo 0.5 , the same as bare ground and therefore with no regulating effect .",
    "equations [ d1 ] show that coexistence of three species is impossible , and in fact the stable solutions ( fig.[fig:0d3 ] ) traverse regions of black - only , black and grey , grey only , grey and white , white only . in each region",
    "unstable equilibria exist for other combinations , and in each case the unstable equilibria have higher @xmath28 than the total one .",
    "this result is robust against changes to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( including species dependent @xmath31 ) .",
    "the equilibrium solution to daisyworld can also be obtained by either integrating equation [ d1 ] or with a minimisation of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath32 subject to constraints .",
    "each gives the same solution ( figs.[fig:0d2],[fig:0d3 ] ) , independent of the history of the system .",
    "thus _ the equilibrium state in 2d and 0d daisyworld can be determined assuming the gaia principle , without knowing detailed dynamics , just as the equilibrium states of thermodynamic systems can be determined by minimising free energy . _",
    "the logistic map is another widely used model for population growth ( hassell , lawton and may , 1976 ) .",
    "the resulting populations famously follow the period doubling route to chaos .",
    "there is no natural selection and again it is interesting to ask whether this model displays any kind of maximum population / maximum entropy behaviour .",
    "the classical logistic map gives an nth population size of    @xmath33\\ ] ]    the equilibrium distribution for @xmath34 depends only on the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the mean population , averaged over 40000 iterations , is shown as a function of @xmath35 in fig[log1 ] .",
    "it exhibits a lot of structure which can be connected with the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map .",
    "the mean population of the attractor is higher than would be expected from maximum entropy ( all levels equally occupied ) .",
    "turning now to entropy , there are many definitions related to the population distribution by analogy with the 2d daisyworld .",
    "for example , the tsallis entropy ( latora et al 2000 )    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the number of occurences of a population between @xmath38 and @xmath39 during m iterations of the logistic map ( taken after a 1000 iteration equilibration period ) .",
    "this quantity has a maximum possible value of 1 , and ( neglecting numerous distinct special cases of limit cycles ) its value tends relatively smoothly to this value with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "however , its actual value depends on n. this only tells us that the area lying within the attractor increases with @xmath35 .",
    "the attractors in the logistic map provide some constraints on the mean value of @xmath34 and the tsallis entropy : it is difficult to define what the `` maximum life '' solution would be .",
    "thus while it is notable that perturbed logistic map dynamics gives mean population in its stable region above 0.5 for all @xmath35 , no quantitative principle emerges .",
    "the 2d - daisyworld model has been used as a testbed to determine whether any global maximisation is applicable to a system governed by the dynamics of natural selection .",
    "we find that maximum entropy production is not valid here , either for biodiversity or heat transfer entropy .",
    "this casts doubt on some recent work in which the mep is assumed as a constraint and used to obtain a solution ( e.g. pujol , 2003 ) .",
    "analysis of 2d and 0d cases suggests that daisyworlds appear to obey a separate optimisation principle , in the simple 2d case indistinguishable from mep , that of maximising the amount of life present in the system .",
    "the logistic map attractors have above average population , but for this system it is difficult to define what the maximal population value should be .",
    "the more fundamental implication is that stability of a dynamic equilibrium can be determined as an optimisation problem on the properties of the system as observed , and that detailed integration of system dynamics through time may be unnecessary in determining the equilibrium state .",
    "p. bak , c. tang , and k. wiesenfeld , `` self - organized criticality '' , physical review a 38 ( 1988 ) 364                                                 bold line shows the mean amount of life from the logistic map , plotted against recursion parameter @xmath35 .",
    "background dots show the bifurcation diagram .",
    "a small amount of random noise added to @xmath40 ( drawn from a flat distribution @xmath41 ) eliminates most of the ordered behaviour , and the gives mean population above 0.5 throughout . without noise ,",
