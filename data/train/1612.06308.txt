    "dimer models are concerned with the set of vertex matchings of a graph , or lattice , @xmath6 .",
    "we shall consider @xmath6 to be a bipartite or non - bipartite lattice with @xmath7 sites , or vertices , on the two torus @xmath8 . a perfect matching , @xmath9 , on @xmath6 is a disjoint collection of edges that contains all the vertices : for @xmath9 to exist @xmath6 must have an even number of vertices .",
    "an edge belonging to a matching is called a _",
    "dimer _ and perfect matchings are the same thing as dimer configurations .",
    "we denote the set of dimer configurations on @xmath6 by @xmath10 .",
    "then to each matching , @xmath11 , we assign a weight @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is normally required to be real in which case all weights are positive",
    ". we will find it useful to go beyond this restriction in the latter part of this paper and consider signed weights , but for the moment we take all weights to be positive .",
    "given this data the _ dimer partition function _",
    "@xmath14 is given by : @xmath15 each matching , @xmath9 , consists of @xmath16 dimers with positive _ edge weights _",
    ", @xmath17 whose relation to @xmath13 is that where @xmath18 are the edges of the matching @xmath9 , and @xmath19 is the weight associated with the edge @xmath18 , then @xmath20 yielding @xmath21    more generally one can consider @xmath22 dimers : i.e. @xmath22 matched edges where @xmath22 is less than or equal to the total number of edges ; when @xmath23 one has a dimer model , otherwise one has a monomer - dimer system .",
    "monomer - dimer systems have not yet yielded to exact solution methods .",
    "an alternative generalisation is to consider some of the weights being negative , we will refer to such a system as containing vortices .",
    "it is relatively straightforward solve for the partition function of such systems and as we shall see they have a rich physics .",
    "we shall only concern ourselves with dimer models , and dimer models with vortices , in this paper .",
    "one can also investigate the probability of one , two , or more dimers ( or edges ) , belonging to a matching @xmath9 : to do this one uses , the characteristic function @xmath24 of an edge @xmath18 , and the dimer - dimer correlation functions @xmath25 : their joint definitions are that @xmath26    for a planar region in @xmath27 , and a graph @xmath6 with @xmath28 vertices , kasteleyn @xcite showed that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pfaffian of the kasteleyn matrix @xmath1 which is a @xmath31 _ signed _ , antisymmetric , weighted adjacency matrix for @xmath6 : kasteleyn s sign assignments in @xmath1 are precisely what is needed to convert @xmath30 into the sum of positive terms that constitute the partition function @xmath14 .",
    "we specialise , for the moment , to the case where @xmath6 is bipartite , so that we can colour @xmath16 vertices black and the other @xmath16 white .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath1 in the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 an @xmath34 real matrix and @xmath35 denotes transpose ; note , too , that @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be vector spaces generated by the sets of black and white vertices respectively , then @xmath33 is the linear map @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sign associated to the edge whose weight is @xmath42 .",
    "the signs @xmath43 are computed by the _ clockwise odd rule _",
    "@xcite : arrows are placed on the edges and @xmath44 when following an arrow and @xmath45 when opposing one , and the product of the signs associated with any fundamental plaquette is @xmath45 when the plaquette is circulated in an anticlockwise direction ; such an assignment of signs is called a _",
    "kasteleyn orientation_.    note that all closed paths on bipartite graphs have an even number of edges : thus clockwise odd is also anticlockwise odd .",
    "this is false for non - bipartite graphs which , when kasteleyn oriented , possess an orientation which can be detected  cf . below where we discuss chern numbers .",
    "the general result @xcite for a graph @xmath6 embedded in a closed oriented surface @xmath46 of genus @xmath47 , is that the partition function of the dimer model on @xmath6 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the set of equivalence classes of the @xmath50 spin structures on @xmath46 , @xmath51 is the arf - invariant of the spin structure labeled by @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the kasteleyn matrix with these boundary conditions .",
    "when the graph @xmath6 is on a torus @xmath8 , the weighted sum is over the four different kasteleyn matrices @xmath54 corresponding to the four choices of periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions around the cycles of the torus and @xmath55 each term in the sum corresponds to one of the @xmath56 discrete spin structures of @xmath6 on @xmath8 and , writing @xmath57 , one has @xmath58    note that since @xmath6 is on a torus it is doubly periodic and can be realised as a quotient : one has @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the graph in the plane consisting of all possible translations by elements of @xmath61 of an appropriate fundamental domain contained in @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath6 itself may be multiple copies of this fundamental domain where the weights are repeated as translates .",
    "then , by fourier transforming @xmath54 we obtain a matrix @xmath62 with off - diagonal block @xmath63 .    on the torus corresponding to the @xmath64 translates of a fundamental tile , the spin structure decomposition for the partition function is given by ensures that the partition function is positive and is induced by the relation of @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "both the sign and the leading expression here , in terms of pfaffians , are valid for both bipartite and non - bipartite graphs . ]",
    "@xmath67    the determinant of @xmath68 results in a polynomial @xmath69 with @xmath70 a key property of the polynomial @xmath71 is that it has a pair of zeros @xmath72 , @xmath73 related by complex conjugation .",
    "we now describe the construction of @xmath69 .",
    "let us label an arbitrary translated copy of the fundamental domain from which @xmath6 is built by @xmath74 with @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 denotes the number of horizontal translations to the right , and @xmath77 the number of translations to the left , the integer @xmath78 labels vertical translations in a similar way ; the fundamental domain is @xmath79 .",
    "thus one has @xmath80 now to each @xmath74 we associate the matrix @xmath81 ; so that , if @xmath82 denotes the signed weight of an edge joining vertex @xmath83 to @xmath84 , then we define @xmath85 with this data the fundamental domain containing the basic graph is @xmath79 and we define @xmath86 by writing @xmath87 so that @xmath88 then @xmath69 is a laurent polynomial in @xmath89 and @xmath90 with _ real _ coefficients .",
    "note that if we defined @xmath86 using a domain other than the fundamental domain , e.g.  if we wrote @xmath91 then @xmath69 would just be multiplied by a monomial in @xmath89 and @xmath90 and the formula for the partition function would still hold true .",
    "now both the infinite graph @xmath60 , and its bipartite black - white assignment , are translation invariant , and the decomposition @xmath92 can be viewed as an indexing of @xmath60 by the characters @xmath93 of the translation group @xmath61 ; in other words @xmath94 is simply the fourier transform of the kasteleyn matrix @xmath95 of @xmath60 .",
    "a pair of examples illustrating the above process can be quite simply given : consider @xmath6 to be the graphs tiled by the fundamental domains of figure [ twoexamples ] .",
    "[ twoexamples ]    then , for the hexagonal graph , we readily calculate that @xmath96 while for the rectangular one we have @xmath97    observe that varying the dimer weights @xmath98 and @xmath99 in ( [ hexpolynomial ] ) is equivalent to moving @xmath89 and @xmath90 off the unit torus . in general , for any polynomial arising from a bipartite dimer construction , one can always absorb combinations of dimer weights into @xmath89 and @xmath90 to move them off the unit torus .",
    "let @xmath100 with @xmath101 be a polynomial , then its zero locus @xmath102 is a curve @xmath103 in @xmath104 .",
    "the image of @xmath103 in @xmath27 under the logarithmic map @xmath105 defined by @xmath106 is known as the _ amoeba _ @xmath107 of @xmath103 so that @xmath108 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath69 above is a special case of such an @xmath109 having _ real coefficients _ @xmath110 and @xmath69 is central to much of what follows ; its zero locus @xmath103 is known as the _ spectral curve _ of the graph @xmath6 .",

    "although an amoeba @xmath107 is unbounded in @xmath27 it has finite area ; in fact its area is bounded above by an irrational multiple of the area of the newton polygon of @xmath109the newton polygon @xmath118 being the convex hull of the ( integer ) points @xmath119 for which @xmath120 .",
    "more precisely one has @xmath121    after multiplication of @xmath69 by a suitable monomial to eliminate its negative powers , one obtains a polynomial @xmath122 of degree @xmath123 , say .",
    "since @xmath122 has real coefficients , it determines the real homogeneous polynomial @xmath124 in @xmath125where now @xmath126and thus a real algebraic curve in @xmath127 , this being natural geometrical data possessed by the spectral curve @xmath103 .",
    "we denote this real algebraic curve by @xmath128 .",
    "when plotting the amoeba @xmath107 the signs of @xmath89 and @xmath90 play an essential role in determining all its components which , in turn , constitute the amoeba boundary .    for dimer models on bipartite graphs",

    "harnack curve_. harnack curves are very special curves possessing the maximal number of components : i.e. .",
    "the integer is the genus @xmath47 of the curve and is equal to the number of compact ovals of the amoeba .",
    "it will be convenient for us to abuse terminology slightly and often refer to a curve @xmath103 ( rather than @xmath128 ) as being harnack , the context should prevent any confusion .",
    "a fundamental result of kenyon , okounkov , and sheffield @xcite and kenyon and okounkov @xcite is that every harnack curve arises in this way so that the correspondence between the spectral curves of periodic hexagonal dimer models and harnack curves is a bijection .",
    "also all bipartite planar graphs can be realised inside a large enough hexagonal lattice by a combination of setting some dimer edge weights to zero and bond contraction @xcite ; thus no bipartite graph is excluded .",
    "in addition , the most general @xmath129 hexagonal dimer model yields a generic harnack curve of genus @xmath130 .",
    "positive rescaling of @xmath89 and @xmath90 gives a free action of @xmath131 on the set @xmath132 of harnack curves ; if one quotients @xmath132 by this action one obtains what is called in @xcite the _ moduli space of harnack curves_. amoebae provide natural coordinates for this moduli space : these coordinates being the areas of the holes and the distances between the tentacles @xcite .    when a curve @xmath103 is harnack the area of its amoeba is maximal and saturates the area inequality above  i.e .",
    "@xmath133 for @xmath103 harnack .",
    "the converse of this equality also holds in the sense that @xmath134 implies that the curve @xmath103 of @xmath109 ( after possible rescaling of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath135 by complex constants ) is invariant under complex conjugation and possesses a real part which determines a harnack curve @xmath128 in @xmath127cf .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "since the polynomial @xmath69 has real coefficients , the map @xmath136 is generically , at least @xmath137 to @xmath138 ; however when @xmath103 is harnack @xmath105 is @xmath137 to @xmath138 everywhere , except at real nodes which occur on the boundary of @xmath107 , cf . @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition @xmath69 has exactly two zeroes , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , on the unit torus @xmath8 .",
    "the amoeba can be viewed as the massless or gapless phase with its bounding curves as the phase boundaries in a dimer model phase diagram @xcite : the complement of the amoeba consists of both compact and non - compact regions . in the terminology of dimer models , as models of melting crystals ,",
    "the non - compact regions exterior to the bounding ovals constitute the frozen regions .",
    "the amoeba itself is referred to as the liquid phase , and the interior of the compact ovals as the gaseous phase .",
    "there are also useful applications of these ideas to the kitaev model @xcite and topological phase transitions @xcite .",
    "these different phases arise naturally when one calculates the correlation functions between the edges of @xmath6 .",
    "the correlation functions possess three types of decay @xcite  where a decay is measured by the fall off of @xmath141 with distance between @xmath142 and @xmath143these types being exponential , polynomial , or no decay , and they correspond to the gaseous , liquid and frozen phases respectively . in the context of kasteleyn matrices as dirac operators ,",
    "the amoeba is the massless phase while the interiors of the compact ovals correspond to massive dirac operators @xcite .",
    "now let @xmath144 once again denote coordinates on @xmath8 , rather than on @xmath145 , and let @xmath6 be a bipartite graph on @xmath8 whose kasteleyn matrix @xmath1 , when fourier transformed , gives @xmath146 where @xmath147 with these conventions the matrix @xmath148 is hermitian . here",
    "we use @xmath28 for the number of vertices in the fundamental tile , in contrast to the usage in the introduction where @xmath28 referred to the total number of vertices in the graph @xmath6 .    if @xmath6 is _ non - bipartite _ its kasteleyn matrix @xmath1 also has a fourier transformed @xmath149 component @xmath146 of the form @xmath150 with at least one of the diagonal blocks @xmath151 and @xmath152 being non - zero and such that @xmath148 is still hermitian .",

    "when taken together the @xmath158 form the non - square matrix @xmath160 where @xmath161 giving one a map @xmath162 as @xmath156 varies the map @xmath160 embeds the fibres @xmath155 of @xmath153and thus the whole bundle  in the trivial bundle @xmath163 ; conversely , if @xmath164 is the adjoint of @xmath160 , the map @xmath165 is an orthogonal projection from @xmath166 to @xmath166 on which rests the non - triviality of @xmath153 .",
    "summarising , and abbreviating @xmath160 and @xmath164 by @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively , yields @xmath169 where @xmath170 denotes the identity matrix on @xmath171 and @xmath172 ; @xmath167 is called a _",
    "partial isometry_it is not a real isometry since @xmath167 is not a square matrix .",
    "a section @xmath173 of @xmath153 is then a map taking values in @xmath166i.e .",
    "one has @xmath174 however , as usual , derivatives of @xmath173 such as @xmath175 may not , as @xmath156 varies , still be @xmath155-valued , but we can project them back onto @xmath153 to take care of this problem thereby creating a covariant derivative on @xmath153 .",
    "thus the covariant derivative of @xmath173 is @xmath176 where @xmath177    our choice of inner product above means that @xmath178 is the covariant derivative corresponding to a @xmath179 connection @xmath180 , say , which we can identify by direct calculation as follows : if @xmath181 is a map @xmath182 then the product @xmath183 gives us the section @xmath184 and the covariant derivative formula gives @xmath185 hence the connection is the @xmath179 matrix @xmath33 where @xmath186 and its curvature is @xmath187 so the covariant derivative and curvature on @xmath153 are @xmath188 and @xmath135 respectively , with @xmath189 .",
    "a routine calculation shows that @xmath190    we shall examine the connection and its curvature in the subsequent sections but note that its introduction has not required the presence of a magnetic field .",

    "it turns out that for _ bipartite graphs _",

    "now , just as when @xmath194 , there is non - trivial holonomy when @xmath221 : we shall also find the interesting result that the holonomy obtained is universal and is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "however first we must identify an appropriate line bundle @xmath222 with connection and to this end we shall use the following notation : we denote the connection and curvature on any bundle @xmath223 by @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively .    so taking our bundle @xmath153whose connection and curvature",
