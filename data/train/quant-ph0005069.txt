    "why quantum computation can be more efficient than its classical counterpart is a fundamental problem that has already attracted significant attention ( ekert and jozsa , 1997 ; kitaev , 1997 ) .",
    "the reason has naturally been sought in the special features of quantum mechanics exploited in quantum computation , like state superposition , entanglement and quantum interference . for what concerns quantum measurement , until now it has been thought to perform the following functions :    * of course , accessing the outcome of the quantum computation process ; * selecting that outcome in a random way . in fact , in the case of some algorithms , a certain number of _ different _ outcomes  obtained through repetition of the overall algorithm  is needed to identify the problem solution .",
    "randomness assures that , by repeating the algorithm , we do not always obtain the same outcome .",
    "we will show that quantum measurement also plays a well defined role in yielding the speed - up .",
    "this is due to the non - causal principle that the measurement outcome is always a _ single _ eigenvalue of the measurement basis .",
    "given a suitable condition , this principle imposes a system of algebraic equations representing the problem to be solved ( or the hard part thereof ) , whereas the measurement outcome , by satisfying that system , yields the problem solution .",
    "the condition is that the state before measurement is ( suitably ) entangled with respect to the contents of two computer registers .",
    "measuring either content , through the single outcome principle , imposes and solves the above mentioned algebraic system .",
    "the time required to measure the content of either register is linear in the number of the register qubits , and it is not affected by registers entanglement  entanglement is interaction free . all the problem complexity is represented in this entanglement and does not affect measurement time : this is also essential to achieve the speed - up .",
    "we shall examine all quantum algorithms found so far under the above perspectives .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we shall provide an overview of our explanation of the speed - up , applied to a simplified version of simon s algorithm .",
    "all details are deferred to the subsequent sections .",
    "the problem is as follows .",
    "given @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 , we consider a function @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath4 . the argument @xmath5 ranges over @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ;",
    "@xmath9 is said to be the size of the problem .",
    "@xmath10 has the following properties :    * it is a 2-to-1 function , namely for any @xmath11 there is one and only one second argument @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; * such @xmath5 and @xmath15 are evenly spaced by a constant value @xmath16 , namely : @xmath17 ; * given a value @xmath5 of the argument , computing the corresponding value of @xmath3 requires a time polynomial in @xmath9 [ i.e. poly@xmath18 ; whereas , given a value @xmath19 of the function , finding an @xmath5 such that @xmath20 , requires a time exponential in @xmath9 [ i.e. exp@xmath21 with any known classical algorithm ; the function is `` hard to reverse '' .    besides knowing the above properties , the problem solver can access a quantum computer that , given any input @xmath5 , produces the output @xmath22 in poly@xmath23 time .",
    "the problem is to find @xmath24 in an efficient way , which turns out to require poly@xmath23 time rather than the exp@xmath23 time required by classical computation .",
    "the computer operates on two registers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , each of @xmath9 qubits ; @xmath25 contains the argument @xmath5 and @xmath26  initially set at zero  will contain the result of computing @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 span@xmath28 , with @xmath29 running over @xmath30 , the hilbert space of the two registers .",
    "the initial state of these registers is    @xmath31    they are , so to speak , blank . by using standard operations like the hadamard transform , and the quantum computer to perform function evaluation ( see ivfor details ) , we obtain in poly@xmath23 time the following registers state ( indexes are as in iv ) :    @xmath32    with @xmath5 running over @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "this is of course the result of `` parallel quantum computation '' .",
    "let us designate by @xmath33 $ ] the number stored in register @xmath26  by @xmath34 $ ] the number stored in @xmath25 .",
    "we measure @xmath33 $ ] in state ( 2 ) . given the character of @xmath3 , the measurement outcome has the form :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the value of the measured observable , and @xmath37 the remaining part of the algorithm serves to extract @xmath24 out of the above superposition , by using quantum interference within register @xmath25 , measurement of @xmath34 $ ] and repetition of the overall process for a sufficient number of times ( see section iv.a ) .",
    "however , we will see that , under a reasonable criterion , the speed - up has already been achieved by preparing state ( 3 ) , thus by performing the two stages of quantum parallel computation and quantum measurement .",
    "how the two stages interplay will be shown afterwards .",
    "since the speed - up is referred to an efficient classical computation that yields the same result , the quantum character of state ( 3 ) constitutes a difficulty .",
    "this is avoided by introducing a local definition of speed - up .",
    "we should explicitly distinguish between a quantum state as a physical thing and its symbolic description . by this we mean",
    "that , for example , the quantum state described by ( 2 ) should be considered a preparation in a lab , while expression ( 2 ) , namely the `` string ''  in the acception of formal languages ",
    "@xmath38    once all @xmath5 and @xmath3 appearing in the sum are substituted with the proper numerical values , is the symbolic description of the preparation .",
    "let us consider the quantum computation cost ( as a function of problem size ) of transforming a quantum state @xmath39 into a quantum state @xmath40 .",
    "this is benchmarked with the classical computation cost of transforming the symbolic description of @xmath39 into the symbolic description of @xmath40 .",
    "the speed - up is the difference between the two .",
    "cost is usually expressed as computation time versus problem size , provided that all other computing resources are comparable .",
    "this definition can be applied to intermediate stages of a quantum algorithm , and coincides with the usual one if applied to the whole algorithm .    first",
    ", we will use it to focus on stage ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of simon s algorithm , in order to check that the speed - up , as defined above , originates here .",
    "this will also serve to clarify the algebraic character of quantum computation ( section iii ) .    on the one hand",
    ", we should assess the time required to produce by classical computation the symbolic description ( 3 ) starting from the symbolic description ( 1 ) ( i.e. from scratch ) .",
    "naturally , @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 should be considered proper numerical values .",
    "finding them requires solving the following system of numerical algebraic equations :    @xmath44    fig .",
    "1    it is useful to resort to the network representation of system ( 4 )  fig .",
    "1 . the gate @xmath45 imposes the condition that if @xmath46 then the output is 1 , if @xmath47 then the output is 0 , and vice - versa . to impose @xmath48",
    ", the gate output must be set at 1 .",
    "note that this network is just a way of representing a system of algebraic equations ( useful to highlight a topological feature , as we will see ) : time is not involved and gates are simply logical constraints .",
    "each of the two gates @xmath3 imposes that if the input is @xmath5 then the output is @xmath3 or , conversely , if the output is @xmath19 then the input is an @xmath5 such that @xmath49    this network is hard to satisfy by classical means . because of the looped network topology , finding a valuation of @xmath50 and @xmath19 which satisfies the network requires reversing @xmath3 at least once , which takes by assumption exp@xmath23 time .",
    "on the other hand , the time required to produce the quantum state ( 3 ) with simon s algorithm , is the sum of the poly@xmath23 time required to produce state ( 2 ) by means of parallel quantum computation , and the time required to measure @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "this latter is independent of state ( 2 ) entanglement and is simply linear in @xmath9 , the number of qubits of register @xmath26 .",
    "the overall time is poly@xmath23 .",
    "the speed - up  as defined above  has already been achieved ( in section iv we will verify from another standpoint that the remaining part of the algorithm can not possibly host any speed - up ) .",
    "let us see _ how _ the speed - up is originated by the interplay between quantum parallel computation and quantum measurement .",
    "this will be shown at a conceptual level herebelow , and formally in section iii .",
    "we shall focus on stage ( 2 ) through ( 3 ) . analyzing the classical computation cost of deriving the symbolic description ( 3 ) from ( 2 ) , provides an appropriate background for showing how quantum measurement operates .    description ( 2 ) can be conveniently visualized as the _ print - out _ of the sum of 2@xmath51 tensor products ( see eq .",
    "2 ) . loosely speaking ,",
    "two values of @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , must be exp@xmath54 spaced . otherwise such a pair of values could be found in poly@xmath23 time by classically computing @xmath3 on a poly@xmath23 number of consecutive arguments .",
    "the point is that the print - out would create a library of babel effect . even for a small @xmath9",
    ", it would fill the entire galaxy with , say , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath55 here , and @xmath55 @xmath57 @xmath55 [ such that @xmath58 in alpha centauri .",
    "finding such a pair of print - outs would still require exp@xmath23 time .    by the way",
    ", this shows that a capability of directly accessing the so - called `` exponential wealth '' of parallel quantum computation , namely the above print - out ( the fact this is impossible is sometimes `` regretted '' ) would be nullified by its `` exponential dilution '' .",
    "let us see the way quantum measurement operates on the result of quantum parallel computation .",
    "it _ distills _ the desired pair of arguments in a time  linear in @xmath9 ( the number of qubits of register @xmath26 ) .",
    "in fact , it does more than randomly selecting one measurement outcome ; by selecting a single outcome _  _  a definite value of _  _",
    "_ it performs a logical operation _",
    "_ crucial for solving the problem _",
    "( i.e. selecting the two values of @xmath5 associated with the value of that outcome ) .",
    "so to speak , quantum measurement would perform as an `` exponentially efficient '' librarian .",
    "its computational role , complementary to the production of the parallel computation outputs , appears to be self - evident ( given a proper understanding of the context ) .",
    "noticeably , this way of operating of quantum measurement `` strongly '' violates the principle of causality ( i.e. that all events have an antecedent cause ) , in the following sense .",
    "it is not only the case that a measurement outcome occurs at random ( this would be the usual violation ) , it is also computed  and physically determined  in a non - causal way .",
    "this is due to the fact that a quantum evolution undergoing selective measurement is affected by _ both _ the initial conditions and the final condition that there is a single measurement outcome .",
    "this outcome is therefore caused by both ends , which naturally violates the principle of antecedent causes .",
    "this appears to be an interesting and completely new physical notion , highlighted by a computational context .",
    "it will be further expounded in sections iii and iv .",
    "we will show that quantum computation is an entirely new paradigm where there is isomorphism between the _ algebraic _ _ definition _ of a solution and its _",
    "physical determination_. this is unlike the usual notion of algorithm , where the isomorphism is between the definition of a sequential computational procedure and its dynamical implementation . as we will see , in quantum computation the definition of a solution is non - sequential and the corresponding physical determination is non - dynamical in character .",
    "let us show that the state after measurement ( 3 ) ( which we consider for short to be the  problem solution ) solves a system of algebraic equations imposed by measuring @xmath33 $ ] in state ( 2 ) .",
    "this is parallel to solving , by classical computation , the system of algebraic equations ( 4 ) .",
    "it is useful to apply von neumann s quantum measurement model .",
    "besides registers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we must consider the pointer of a measurement apparatus that will give the result of measuring @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath59 be the state before measurement of the whole system ; @xmath60 denotes the pointer initial state .",
    "von neumann s model has two steps .",
    "the first , corresponding to the measurement interaction , is a unitary evolution @xmath61 leading from the state before measurement to a `` provisional description '' of the state after measurement :    @xmath62    @xmath63    with @xmath64 running over all the values taken by @xmath3 . as stated before , measurement time",
    "@xmath65 is linear in @xmath9 .",
    "as well known , description ( 5 ) yields the appropriate correlation between @xmath33 $ ] and the indication of the pointer , but it conflicts with the empirical evidence that both ( i.e. @xmath66 ) must have a definite measured value .    the second step of von neumann s model can be seen as a _ reinterpretation _ of description ( 5 ) : the tensor products appearing in the right hand of ( 5 ) should be considered mutually exclusive measurement outcomes ( still at the same time @xmath67 ) with probability distribution the square modules of the respective probability amplitudes .",
    "this yields a measurement outcome of the form :    @xmath68    where @xmath43 is a definite value . in the following , we will disregard the mathematically redundant factor @xmath69 .    note",
    "that this reinterpretation , as it is , does not involve the notion of time and is `` transparent '' to dynamics , in the sense it does not affect measurement time @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , the selection of @xmath70 , essential to achieve the speed - up , stems from the reinterpretation , i.e. by the non - causal principle that there must be a single measurement outcome .",
    "this principle is usually applied in a procedural way : by performing a sequence of typographic operations ( in the acception of formal languages ) on the symbolic description of the state before measurement , we obtain the symbolic description of a possible state after measurement .",
    "this procedural approach conceals the algebraic character of the reinterpretational step .",
    "in fact , by applying a system of algebraic equations to an `` unknown '' vector @xmath71 of the hilbert space of the two registers @xmath72 , we obtain the same result .",
    "the form of this vector is naturally @xmath73 , where @xmath29 runs over @xmath30 , and @xmath74 are complex variables independent of each other up to normalization : @xmath75    let @xmath76 be the set of the eigenstates of register @xmath77and @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath76 be the eigenstate selected by the quantum measurement of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the first equation is    @xmath80    @xmath81 is naturally the projector on the hilbert subspace @xmath82 span@xmath83 with @xmath5 running over @xmath84 and @xmath78 being fixed ; a @xmath85 satisfying eq .",
    "( 6 ) is a free linear combination of all the tensor products of @xmath72 containing @xmath86 ;    @xmath87    @xmath71 satisfying equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) becomes the projection of @xmath88 on @xmath89@xmath90 this means that @xmath78 has `` dragged '' all the tensor products of @xmath91 containing it .",
    "the solution of the two equations is indeed the state after measurement @xmath92 given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , formerly derived in the procedural way .    to sum up ,",
    "solving the system of algebraic equations ( 6 - 7 ) is equivalent to performing the reinterpretational step of von neumann s model .",
    "this does not affect the first step .",
    "in other words , performing the first step gives `` for free '' ( without incurring any further dynamical cost ) the solution of ( 6 - 7 ) $ ] , which is linear in @xmath9 . ] . under the current definition of speed - up ,",
    "solving equations ( 6 - 7 ) is equivalent to solving the system of algebraic equations ( 4 ) , namely the classically hard part of the problem .",
    "this isomorphism between algebraic definition and physical determination of a solution , blurs a long - standing distinction of mathematical logic between the notions of `` implicit definition '' and `` computation '' .",
    "in problem solving , a problem implicitly defines its solution .",
    "for example , let us consider factorization : given the known product @xmath93 of two unknown prime numbers @xmath5 and @xmath94 , the numerical algebraic equation @xmath95 _ implicitly _ _ defines _ the values of @xmath5 and @xmath94 that satisfy it .",
    "the system of algebraic equations ( 4 ) constitutes a similar example .    in the classical framework ,",
    "an implicit or algebraic definition of a solution does not prescribe how to find it .",
    "in order to find the solution , the implicit definition must be changed into an equivalent constructive definition , namely into an algorithm ( which is always possible with the problems we are dealing with ) .",
    "an algorithm is an abstraction of the way things can be constructed in reality  inevitably in a model thereof  and prescribes a computation process that builds the solution .",
    "the current notion of algorithm still reflects the way things can be constructed in the traditional classical reality ",
    "namely through a sequential ( dynamical / causal ) process . turing machine computation and the boolean network representation of computation are examples of sequential ( dynamical / causal ) computation .",
    "in fact , an algorithm specifies a causal propagation of logical implication from a completely defined input to a completely defined output which contains the solution .",
    "it is thus meant to be executable through a dynamical / causal process .",
    "we can see that a feature of quantum computation essential to achieve the speed - up , namely selective measurement , is extraneous to the causal notions of both algorithm and dynamics .",
    "in particular , quantum computation _ is not _",
    "`` quantum turing machine computation '' . out of habit , we will keep the name of algorithm even in the case of a quantum computation yielding a speed - up .",
    "without significant loss of generality , we will follow the simplified version ( cleeve et al . , 1997 ) of simon",
    "s algorithm ( 1994 ) . for the sake of illustration",
    ", the following table gives a trivial example .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i    the block diagram of the simplified algorithm is given in fig .",
    "2  we should disregard @xmath96 for the time being .",
    "fig . 2    the blocks in fig .",
    "2 represent the following transformations .    *",
    "the @xmath3 transform ( a reversible boolean gate in the time - diagram of computation ) leaves the content of register @xmath25 unaltered , so that an input @xmath5 is repeated in the corresponding output , and computes @xmath10 adding it to the former content of register @xmath26 ( which was set to zero ) .",
    "if the input state is not sharp but is a quantum superposition , the same transformation applies to any tensor product appearing in it .",
    "* @xmath97 is the hadamard transform defined as follows : @xmath98 @xmath99 . in the case of a register of n qubits , containing the number @xmath100",
    ", it yields @xmath101 where @xmath2 , @xmath5 ranges over @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 denotes the module 2 inner product of the two numbers in binary notation ( seen as row matrices ) . *",
    "@xmath105 represents the action of measuring the numerical content of a register .",
    "we shall give some significant computational states ( also for the example ) .",
    "the preparation is @xmath106 after performing hadamard on @xmath25 and function evaluation , we have :    @xmath107 this is the state before the intermediate measurement of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "measuring @xmath33 $ ] yields , say , @xmath108 ; the state after measurement is consequently :    @xmath109    ekert and jozsa ( 1998 ) have shown that quantum entanglement between qubits is essential for providing a speed - up , in terms of time or other computing resources , in the class of quantum algorithms we are dealing with .",
    "after measuring @xmath3 , the state of the two registers becomes factorizable , and all entanglement is destroyed .",
    "the remaining actions , performed on register @xmath25 , use interference ( which generates no entanglement ) to `` extract '' @xmath24 out of the superposition @xmath110 .",
    "we must conclude from another standpoint that the speed - up has been achieved by preparing @xmath111 .    performing again @xmath97 on register @xmath25 yields :    @xmath112 \\left| z\\right\\rangle _ { x}\\left| \\overline{f}\\right\\rangle _ { f}.\\ ] ]",
    "let us designate by @xmath113 the result of measuring @xmath34 $ ] in @xmath114 ; @xmath115 must be 0  see the form of @xmath114 .",
    "this latter property holds unaltered even if the intermediate measurement of @xmath116 $ ] is omitted , as well known . by repeating the overall computation process a sufficient number of times , poly(@xmath9 ) on average , a number of different constraints @xmath117 sufficient to identify @xmath24 is gathered .    how the speed - up is achieved in",
    "@xmath118 $ ] has been anticipated in sections ii and iii .",
    "summarizing , measuring @xmath33 $ ] in state @xmath119 imposes the system of algebraic equations ( 6 - 7 ) [ corresponding to ( 4 ) ] and yields the superposition of a pair of values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 which satisfy this system ( @xmath24 is `` easily '' extracted from this superposition ) .",
    "the overall procedure requires poly(n ) time , whereas solving equations ( 4 ) by classical computation would require exp(@xmath9 ) time .",
    "finally , let us show that performing or skipping the `` intermediate measurement '' of @xmath33 $ ] in @xmath91 , is _",
    "equivalent_. if we skip it ( in fig .",
    "2 , the symbol @xmath122on @xmath26 should be erased ) , the state of registers @xmath25 and @xmath26 at time @xmath123 remains entangled . in the case of the example , this is @xmath124\\ ] ]    a direct measurement of register @xmath25 qubits is _ equivalent _ to measuring first the content of @xmath25 with respect to the following basis :    @xmath125    in fact , one can see that introducing this previous measurement is a _",
    "redundant _ operation with respect to measuring the individual qubits . because of state ( 8) entanglement , this measurement is equivalent to measuring @xmath33 $ ] instead .",
    "the result is , say :    @xmath126    it is useful to resort to the notion of wave function collapse  by the way without having to adhere to it .",
    "we are just discussing a mathematical equivalence , and the notion of collapse is a mathematically legitimate one . according to von neumann , collapse on state ( 9 ) can be backdated in time provided that its result ( 9 ) undergoes in an inverted way the same transformation undergone by the time - forward evolution ( the usual one ) .",
    "it can readily be seen that backdating this collapse at time @xmath127 is equivalent to having performed the intermediate measurement of @xmath116 $ ] in state ( 2 ) .    finally , it should be noted that @xmath33 $ ] does not actually need to be measured .",
    "this measurement is a virtual consequence of measuring only @xmath128 $ ] at the end .",
    "the problem of factoring an integer @xmath129  the product of two unknown primes  is transformed into the problem of finding the period of the function @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is an integer between @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and is coprime with @xmath129 ( shor , 1994 ; cleve et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 can also represent shor s algorithm , provided that @xmath3 is as defined above and the second hadamard transform @xmath97 is substituted by the discrete fourier transform @xmath26 .",
    "the state before measurement has the form @xmath134 .",
    "measuring or not measuring @xmath10 in @xmath119 is still equivalent . by measuring it , the above quantum state changes into the superposition    @xmath135",
    "where @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is a normalization factor .",
    "the second part of the algorithm generates no entanglement and serves to `` extract '' @xmath24 in polynomial time , by using fourier - transform interference and auxiliary , off line , mathematical considerations . under the current assumptions ,",
    "the quantum speed - up has been achieved by preparing state ( 10 ) : the discussion is completely similar to that of the previous algorithm .",
    "the seminal 1985 deutsch s algorithm has been the first demonstration of a quantum speed - up . in its usual form",
    ", this algorithm yields a deterministic output , apparently ruling out the role of selective measurement .",
    "a  more careful examination will show that this is not the case .",
    "deutsch s algorithm , and more in general quantum oracle computing , is better seen as a competition between two players .",
    "one  the oracle  produces the problem , the other should produce the solution . sticking to greek tradition , we shall call the former player sphinx , the latter oedipus .",
    "the competition is formalized as follows .",
    "both players have complete knowledge of a set of functions @xmath138 ( @xmath139 labels the elements of the set ) .",
    "they can also access a computer that , set in its @xmath140-th mode , computes @xmath141 given any input @xmath11 .",
    "the sphinx chooses @xmath139 at random , sets the computer in its @xmath139-th mode and passes it on to oedipus .",
    "oedipus knows nothing of the sphinx choice and must efficiently find @xmath139 by testing the computer input - output behaviour .",
    "he is naturally forbidden to inspect the computer mode .",
    "if the computer is quantum , then we speak of `` quantum oracle computing '' .",
    "deutsch s ( 1985 ) algorithm , as modified in ( cleve et al . , 1997 ) , is as follows .",
    "let @xmath142 be the set of all possible functions @xmath143 , namely :     @xmath144 & & & @xmath5 & @xmath145 & & & @xmath5 & @xmath146 & & & @xmath5 & @xmath147 + @xmath132 & @xmath132 & & & @xmath132 & @xmath132 & & & @xmath132 & @xmath148 & & & @xmath149 & @xmath148 + @xmath148 & @xmath132 & & & @xmath148 & @xmath148 & & & @xmath148 & @xmath132 & & & @xmath150 & @xmath148 +    @xmath142 is divided into a couple of subsets : the balanced functions , characterized by an even number of zero and one function values , thus labeled by @xmath151 , and the unbalanced ones , labeled by @xmath152 .",
    "oedipus must find , with a minimum number of computer runs , whether the computer ( whose mode has been randomly set by the sphinx ) computes a balanced or an unbalanced function .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated in fig .",
    "the computation of @xmath141 is represented as a reversible boolean gate , like in the previous algorithms but for the fact that the result of the computation is now module 2 added to the former content of register @xmath26 .",
    "3(a),(b )    let us consider the significant computational states .",
    "the preparation is the same for all @xmath139 : @xmath153the state at time @xmath67 before measurement , after performing function evaluation by running the computer only once ( fig .",
    "3a ) , depends on the sphinx choice :    if @xmath154 then @xmath155 @xmath156    if @xmath157 then @xmath158 @xmath156    if @xmath159 then @xmath160 @xmath161    if @xmath162",
    "then @xmath163 @xmath161    it can be seen that measuring @xmath34 $ ] gives oedipus answer ( 1 for balanced , 0 for unbalanced ) .",
    "this algorithm is more efficient than any classical algorithm , where two runs of the computer would be required to establish the answer .",
    "however , the result is apparently reached in a deterministic way , without quantum measurement performing any selection .",
    "this must be ascribed to the incomplete physical representation of the situation . in sections iv.a and iv.b , we had a problem that implicitly defined its solution .",
    "the physical determination of the solution was obtained by measuring the content of a computer register in an entangled state representing the problem to be solved ( or the hard part thereof ) .",
    "this obviously requires that the problem is physically represented were physically represented in a superposition of the form ( 2 ) . ] , whereas presently an essential part of it , the sphinx choosing the oracle mode , is not .",
    "for example , the logical if - then conditions above are external to the physical representation .    in order to complete the physical representation",
    ", we introduce the extended gate @xmath164 which computes the function @xmath165 for all @xmath139 and @xmath5 .",

    "this concretely shows that there are ways of getting out of the usual quantum computation paradigm .",
    "this work conflicts ( castagnoli et al . , 2000 ) with the many worlds interpretation .",
    "as well known , this interpretation aims to restore the principle of causality by denying the objectivity of the ( non - causal ) principle that there is always a single measurement outcome ( denoted by @xmath184 in the following ) .",

    "ascribable to a limitation of our perception .",
