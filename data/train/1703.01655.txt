    "the matrix elements of @xmath105 as given by @xmath106 can not be simplified as above , because the operator @xmath107 is not lattice - periodic .      in order to be able to calculate the matrix elements as discussed above",

    "there is an important point these potentials have in common : both produce a bandgap of 3.2 ev , which is in agreement with the material properties of zno .",
    "clearly , apart from the bandgap , the two potentials correspond to different band schemes , but the qualitative results related to the question of gauge invariance are the same in both cases . for the sake of definiteness , we used @xmath113 for obtaining the data presented in fig .  1 .    having @xmath123 grid points @xmath124 in the 1d unit cell , eq .",

    "it is convenient to use discrete @xmath127 indices as well , @xmath128 and @xmath129 in this way , we obtain @xmath130 functions @xmath131 and  besides the matrix elements ( [ hmatrixelements ] )  we can calculate their overlaps @xmath132 numerically .",
    "note that  by construction  we have @xmath133 with sufficient number of real - space discretization points , the integrals ( [ hmatrixelements ] ) and ( [ overlap ] ) converge for the lowest lying energy eigenstates .",

    "more precisely , for a given initial index @xmath135 whenever @xmath136 equals one of the k - space grid points @xmath137 , we can use the overlap matrix to calculate the transformation . since these time instants @xmath138 are the same for any initial index @xmath135 the time evolution of the complete density matrix can be calculated and compared in both gauges at the discrete @xmath138 values . in this way ,",
    "discretization in k - space affects only the time resolution of the results : at @xmath139 the calculated physical quantities are numerically exact in the sense that the only approximation is real space discretization .    in our actual calculations ,",

    "the amplitude is chosen to correspond to a peak laser field strength of 1.0 gv / m .",
    "finally , note that the overlap matrix ( [ overlap ] ) is clearly unitary , provided all the bands are taken into account . however",
    ", when we do not use all the bands ( either below or above the highest valence band ) , the appropriate projection of @xmath144 may not be exactly unitary , leading to the fact that the norm ( trace of the density matrix ) is not the same in the two gauges .",
    "in other words , besides the usual criteria a numerical method has to satisfy ( convergence , stability , etc . ) , the requirement of gauge invariance sets a new one .",
    "working in bloch - state basis , this simply means that a large enough number of bands has to be taken into account .",

    "<S> [ introsec ] _ introduction _ the idea that solid state targets illuminated by strong , short near infrared pulses can produce coherent x - ray radiation @xcite or even attosecond electromagnetic bursts @xcite preceded the first experiments that demonstrated the appearance of high - order harmonics ( up to order of 25 ) in the spectra of strongly driven solid state samples . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a wide bandgap zno target ( 3.2 ev ) was excited by a pulse with central wavelength of 3.25 @xmath0 m , meaning that at least 9 photons are required for an excitation from the valance to the conduction band [ see also @xcite for more details ] . </S>",

    "<S> theoretically , semiconductor bloch - equations were applied to describe the problem @xcite , a closed - form expression were given to the subcycle - resolved transition rate of electrons between bands @xcite , appearance of attosecond pulses were predicted @xcite , semiclassical @xcite and a saddle - point @xcite analysis were performed and the role of an indirect bandgap was also investigated @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the exciting laser pulse was below the damage threshold in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) is known to be possible also in plasmas emerging from solid state surfaces as a consequence of intense electromagnetic radiation [ see e.g. ,  @xcite for a review ] , here we focus on the case when a system of electrons in a static , periodic potential interacts with the exciting laser field @xcite .    neglecting relaxation and multiparticle effects , the response of the electronic subsystem in a solid to the external laser pulse is usually categorized as follows : ( 1 ) interband transitions , ( 2 ) laser - driven intraband motion , ( 3 ) dynamical bloch - oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the first phenomenon is the usual optical generation of charge carriers , but this is already a nonlinear effect in the range of hhg . </S>",

    "<S> it is important to note that mechanisms 1 - 3 are coupled , practically none of them appears on its own @xcite .    as we show in the following , although separating inter- and intraband dynamics is very useful for the intuitive interpretation of the physical processes , it depends on the choice of the electromagnetic gauge . in other words , gauge transformations ( which , obviously , do not change physically relevant results ) mix the inter- and intraband dynamics .    </S>",
