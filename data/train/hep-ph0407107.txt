    "by now there is increasing an experimental evidence for the existence of an exotic baryon state , the @xmath0 pentaquark @xcite .",
    "its parity , however , is not yet identified .",
    "this quantum number is a decisive quantity regarding the substructure of the observed strangeness @xmath11 resonance @xcite . in recent months",
    "several proposals were put forward to determine its parity , in both hadronically @xcite and electromagnetically @xcite induced reactions . in these reactions , both the model - dependent and model - independent analyses reveal that certain spin observables are directly related and/or very sensitive to the parity of the @xmath5 . indeed , based on reflection symmetry in the scattering plane",
    ", it has been shown in ref . @xcite",
    "that it is straightforward to identify the spin observables which are directly related to the parity of the @xmath5 .",
    "although the considerations in that work have been confined to the photoproduction reaction , the method discussed there for the parity determination is quite general and can be easily applied to other reactions induced either by hadronic or electromagnetic probes .",
    "however , the method requires the polarization of the @xmath5 to be measured , a requirement that poses an enormous experimental challenge .    amongst the existing proposals , the one by a. thomas et al .",
    "@xcite to measure @xmath12 seems to be most appealing , for it points to a model - independent determination of the parity without the need to determine the @xmath5 polarization .",
    "moreover , the first observation of the @xmath5 in an nucleon  nucleon ( @xmath13 ) collision @xcite suggests that the production cross section is in the order of 0.4  @xmath14 so that concrete experimental investigations on the @xmath5 parity in this reaction seem to be indeed feasible .",
    "the idea by a. thomas et al .",
    "exploits the fact that in the @xmath13 system the pauli principle links spin and parity : in order to obey fermi statistics the quantum numbers characterizing the @xmath13 system have to fulfill @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orbital angular momentum and the total spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "thus  for a given isospin  the total parity @xmath19 of the system is closely linked to its spin , since @xmath20 .",
    "if the final state is in an @xmath21wave we have , in addition , @xmath22 , which allows to determine the parity of the exotic baryon through a manipulation of the initial spin state . in ref",
    "@xcite this proposal was worked out in detail and , in particular , the spin correlation parameter @xmath6 , was identified as _ the _ crucial observable and its energy dependence was discussed based on general arguments .",
    "the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite were shortly afterwards supported by a particular model calculation @xcite .",
    "a very important observation was made in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , that if the @xmath5 is an isoscalar then the channel @xmath23 offers independent additional information .",
    "as should be clear from eq .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) , the role of the positive and negative parities is interchanged when switching from isospin @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , other observables and the case of arbitrary spin of the @xmath5 were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it was argued that the spin transfer coefficient @xmath7 plays a special role amongst all possible polarization observables that can be measured in @xmath13 induced reactions , for it might allow a determination of the parity of the @xmath5 with currently available experimental facilities .",
    "this is because the hyperons have a self - analyzing decay that allows to determine the hyperon polarization solely from the angular pattern of the decay particles .",
    "so far these considerations have been restricted to threshold kinematics only .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the suggested methods for a parity determination in @xmath13 collisions .",
    "furthermore , we provide detailed information for an explicit experimental determination of the parity of the @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , we shall    * show that the energy dependence of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the unpolarized cross section , leads to an unambiguous determination of the parity of the @xmath5 ; * discuss the possibilities to determine the parity from a measurement of the spin transfer coefficient @xmath7 .    the above two points will be examined on general grounds .",
    "furthermore , in order to corroborate our findings , we complement them with a concrete calculation within a meson  exchange model . to be concrete",
    "we consider the case of a spin @xmath26@xmath5 only .",
    "in ref . @xcite it was shown that @xmath27 projects on spin triplet initial states in the @xmath28 reaction ( @xmath29 ) . from this , it was concluded @xcite that a measurement of @xmath6 in these reactions would be the ideal quantity for the parity determination of the @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that , when approaching the production threshold energy , this quantity has to approach the value of -1 in the case of a positive parity pentaquark but necessarily a positive value in the case of a negative parity pentaquark in the reaction channel @xmath30 . in the @xmath31 channel , this role is interchanged , i.e. , @xmath6 approaches -1 in the case of a negative parity but a positive value in the case of a positive parity pentaquark .",
    "however , to make these findings of any practical use , it was necessary to provide an educated guess for the behavior of @xmath6 away from the physical threshold , i.e. for excess energies up to 50 mev , say , for only there an experiment can be performed with reasonable count rates . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was done using the so  called naturalness assumption :",
    "it was assumed that an @xmath32th partial wave introduces a factor of @xmath33 into the corresponding amplitude , where @xmath34 is the relative momentum of the outgoing particles and @xmath3 is a scale typical for the production itself .",
    "apart from this factor , the ( reduced ) partial wave amplitudes were assumed to be of the same magnitude for all partial waves . for later reference the corresponding result for the energy dependence of @xmath6",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ axx_mi ] as a function of the excess energy @xmath35 .",
    "naturally the question arises how reliable are the scale arguments mentioned above .",
    "final state interactions can introduce additional large scales into the problem .",
    "however , as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are good reasons to believe that the @xmath5hyperon interaction is weak .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the coulomb interaction has no influence anymore for excess energies of 10 mev or higher .",
    "however , scale arguments typically indicate only the order of magnitude of particular contributions and thus can well be off by factors of 23 .",
    "in addition , they can not account for possible cancellations amongst different production mechanisms .",
    "unfortunately , these uncertainties can lead to wrong conclusions on the parity of the @xmath5 , because they could change significantly the energy dependence of @xmath6 compared to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ axx_mi ] . for illustration of this point in the middle row of figs .",
    "[ pp ] and [ pn ] we show the results for @xmath6 calculated within various models described in detail in the appendix . a comparison with the prediction in fig .",
    "[ axx_mi ] shows that @xmath6 in case of a positive parity pentaquark ( dashed curves ) in the second and third columns in fig .",
    "[ pp ] would lead to an erroneous assignment of the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "the same can be said about the negative parity results for the @xmath36 reaction , shown as the solid curve in the third column of fig .",
    "it is thus necessary to look for observables that allow solid conclusions about the parity of the resonance produced irrespective of the relative importance of various amplitudes .",
    "such observables indeed exist !",
    "the key observation is that @xmath37 projects onto the spin triplet initial states and , therefore , its energy dependence will unambiguously point to the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "let us discuss this argument in more detail : we consider first the @xmath38 reaction .",
    "odd ( even ) partial waves in the final state correspond to odd ( even ) partial waves in the initial state in case of a positive parity pentaquark but to even ( odd ) partial waves in the initial state for a negative parity pentaquark . from eq .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) we find that for this reaction the initial state is in a spin triplet ( singlet ) state for positive parity but in a spin singlet ( triplet ) state for negative parity .",
    "thus , the lowest ( even ) partial wave in the final state corresponds to a spin singlet or triplet initial state for positive or negative parity , respectively .",
    "since the centrifugal barrier leads to a momentum dependence of the @xmath32th partial wave amplitude of @xmath39 we find that the spin triplet cross section in the @xmath40 induced reaction should scale as @xmath41 for a negative parity pentaquark and as @xmath42 for a positiv parity pentaquark which corresponds to a range of @xmath43 . ] .",
    "this observation on the energy dependence of the spin triplet cross section holds irrespective of the relative importance of different partial waves . for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ pp ] we show the results of various model calculations ( see appendix for details ) for the energy dependence of the total cross section @xmath9 , @xmath6 and the spin triplet cross section @xmath37 .",
    "( note that the results shown in figs .",
    "[ pp ] and [ pn ] are divided by the factor @xmath44 , i.e. by the two - body phase - space volume . )",
    "the results for the positive parity pentaquark are shown as dashed lines whereas those for the negative parity pentaquark are shown as solid lines . in order to exhibit better the difference in the energy dependence of the observables corresponding to different parities of the pentaquark ,",
    "the results for @xmath9 and @xmath37 are scaled to 1 at @xmath45 mev for all models .",
    "although the energy dependence of @xmath6 exhibited by two of the models considered in fig .",
    "[ pp ] is significantly stronger than what is expected for natural - size amplitudes ( c.f .",
    "[ axx_mi ] ) , the energy dependence of @xmath37 for the two parities always follows the features discussed above and , consequently , allows definite conclusions on the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "analogously , for the @xmath46 reaction the spin triplet cross section should scale as @xmath42 for odd parity pentaquarks and as @xmath41 for even parity pentaquarks . in fig .",
    "[ pn ] we show the results of the same models used before for the @xmath36 channel .",
    "again , we observe that the scaling argument leading to the results of @xmath6 presented in fig . [ axx_mi ]",
    "is violated here for one of the models considered , but the energy dependence of @xmath37 allows definite conclusions on the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "one might still ask what would happen if for some reason the @xmath21wave amplitude is strongly suppressed or even absent . even in this case",
    "the method of parity determination proposed will work .",
    "to be concrete let us look at the channel @xmath38 only .",
    "if the pentaquark has positive parity a spin triplet initial state is to be at least in a @xmath47wave .",
    "thus , @xmath37 should follow a @xmath42 behavior independent of the strength of the @xmath21wave .",
    "model such that this case is realized in the right column of fig .",
    "if the pentaquark has negative parity , spin triplet initial states lead to even partial wave final states . in the absence of an @xmath21wave",
    "this implies a behavior at least as @xmath48 for @xmath37 .",
    "consequently we should expect the spin triplet cross section to be strongly suppressed in comparsion to the total cross section which should show a @xmath42 behavior !",
    "again this difference is decisive .",
    "it should also be stressed that all arguments given above hold even if the @xmath5 signal seen in the experiment would be due to an interference of the resonance signal with the background .",
    "therefore , we propose to measure the total cross section as well as the corresponding ( angle integrated ) spin - correlation parameter @xmath6 for @xmath13 induced pentaquark production at two well separated energies , e.g. at excess energies of @xmath45 and 40 mev .",
    "in addition to the spin correlation coefficient @xmath6 also the spin transfer coefficient @xmath7 is discussed in the literature as a useful observable to determine the parity of the pentaquark in @xmath13 collisions .    the energy dependence of @xmath7 can not be studied on as general grounds as that of the spin triplet cross section @xmath37 discussed in the previous section . however , using the methods outlined in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite we may give the general angular and energy dependence of @xmath7 up to terms of order @xmath49 .",
    "this analysis leads to the following structure for negative parity pentaquarks produced in the @xmath50 reaction , @xmath51 +   { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{p'^3}{\\lambda^3}\\right ) \\ , \\label{oddpp}\\ ] ] where all the coefficients ( @xmath52 ) turn out to be independent from each other . on the other hand , for positive parity pentaquarks produced in the @xmath40 induced reaction we find @xmath53 +   { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{p'^3}{\\lambda^3}\\right ) \\ , \\label{evenpp}\\ ] ] where again all the coefficients ( @xmath54 ) turn out to be independent from each other .",
    "( [ oddpp ] ) and ( [ evenpp ] ) reflect the different threshold behavior for the two different parities first pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite : only for negative parity pentaquarks produced in the @xmath40 reaction a non  vanishing threshold value is allowed for @xmath7 .",
    "however , nothing prevents @xmath55 from being small and thus it can not be said a priori , whether a conclusion on the parity of the pentaquark can be drawn from a measurement of @xmath7we come back to this issue below .",
    "the relevant expressions for the @xmath56 channel are identical to eqs .",
    "( [ oddpp ] ) and ( [ evenpp ] ) , except that the roles of the different parities are interchanged .    to simplify the discussion we will now focus on the @xmath40 system only .",
    "the terms higher order in @xmath57 are given here for the first time .",
    "for both parities the term linear in @xmath34 stems from an interference of @xmath21 and @xmath47waves in the final state .",
    "the terms quadratic in @xmath34 originate from the interference of various spin triplet initial states and thus stem from @xmath47waves interfering with each other in case of an even parity pentaquark and from @xmath21waves interfering with @xmath58waves in case of an odd parity pentaquark .",
    "as was stressed in the previous paragraph , we should identify observables that allow conclusions on the parity without the need to employ scale arguments for the relative importance of different partial waves .",
    "it turns out that @xmath59 is such a quantity",
    ". a close look at eqs .",
    "( [ oddpp ] ) and ( [ evenpp ] ) reveals that ideally one may extract from the experiment @xmath59 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 at two different energies , for in this case the production of a negative parity pentaquark can lead to an energy independent non  zero result ( up to the energy dependence from phase space and small corrections due to the energy dependence of the production operator ) , whereas a positive parity pentaquark can lead to a linear energy dependence ( in this case an energy independent result consistent with zero would not be conclusive , for the parameter @xmath62 can also be 0 ) .",
    "however , this would require a highly differential measurement .",
    "fortunately , already the angle integrated result for @xmath59 can provide valuable information when one extrapolates linearly from the data to the threshold after dividing by the phase space factor @xmath34 . here",
    "a finite value is possible only for a positive parity pentaquark whereas a negative parity pentaquark has to lead to a vanishing @xmath59 at threshold .",
    "note , however , that no conclusion on the parity can be drawn if this extrapolation leads to a value consistent with zero ( unfortunately we do not have a model calculation to illustrate this point  see also footnote 3 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ dxx_pp ] and [ dxx_pn ] we show results for @xmath59 , corrected for the phase space behavior , based on the same models used in the previous paragraph .",
    "as can be seen in all cases the extrapolation to threshold allows for a discrimination of the different parities .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the experimental uncertainty on @xmath59 will be large if the value of @xmath7 is small .",
    "for example , a small @xmath7 for the @xmath31 channel resulted from the considered @xmath63 model ( right column of fig .",
    "[ dxx_pn ] ) .",
    "we can make this statement somewhat more quantitative .",
    "it is well known that the statistical fluctuation in an observable , in this case @xmath64 - [ \\sigma(+-)+\\sigma(-+)]$ ] , scales as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the count rate for the individual spin cross sections .",
    "on the other hand , the signal itself is given by @xmath67 counts .",
    "thus we find for the relative uncertainty @xmath68 of @xmath59 @xmath69 to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath59 to 10 % ( @xmath70 ) we find a required count rate for the polarized cross section of @xmath71 , where we assumed 100 % polarization in the beam as well as 100 % acceptance in the final state .",
    "more realistic numbers will increase our count rate estimate .",
    "this formula shows that if @xmath7 is 0.5 or larger , one needs at least 400 events in the polarized cross section .",
    "however , if @xmath7 turns out to be only of the order of 0.1 in the energy range accessible to the experiment ( as it is predicted by some of the considered models ) then one needs @xmath72 .    to conclude , if it is possible to measure @xmath7 with reasonable accuracy at two different and sufficiently separated energies , it could be possible to extract the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "if an extrapolation from the measured values of @xmath59 to the threshold leads to a non  vanishing value in the @xmath50 channel , the parity of the pentaquark must be negative , whereas if it leads to a non  vanishing value in the @xmath36 induced reaction , the parity must be positive .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that here significantly higher statistics is necessary compared to the measurement of @xmath6 for there the energy dependence of @xmath8 was the quantity of interest whereas here an extrapolation to the threshold is necessary and for both parities the term linear in energy might be sizable .",
    "we examined critically the possibility to determine the parity of the @xmath0 from the reactions @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3 or @xmath4 hyperon , recently discussed in the literature . specifically , we studied the energy dependences of the observables that have been suggested in the literature to be the most promising ones to unravel the parity of the @xmath5 , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the validity and/or breakdown of general scale arguments were critically examined , showing that peculiarities of the so far unknown production mechanism of the @xmath5 could make conclusions based on such scale arguments rather unreliable .    on the other hand",
    ", we showed that the energy dependence of @xmath8 , corresponding to the spin - triplet production cross section , guarantees unambiguous information on the parity of the @xmath5 , since it does not rely on any assumptions such as scale arguments .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that the spin transfer coefficient @xmath7 could , under certain conditions , also be used to determine the parity of the pentaquark .",
    "a non  vanishing value of @xmath10 , when extrapolated linearly from the measured values to the threshold , will tell the parity .",
    "however , this measurement requires in any case very high statistics .",
    "in addition , only a non  vanishing value at the threshold would be conclusive .",
    "a threshold value consistent with zero is in accordance with both parities .",
    "finally , it should be clear that the presented results are applicable for the parity determination of any narrow spin1/2 baryon resonance in @xmath13 collisions , for they are based solely on general considerations .",
    "we thank f. rathman and a. sibirtsev for very useful discussions .",
    "the work of kn is partly supported by cosy grant no .",
    "to illustrate the points made in the main section , we perform a concrete calculation within the meson  exchange framework .",
    "it should be stressed that this model calculation is intended to provide only a qualitative picture of the features discussed in work . for quantitative predictions",
    "further and important ingredients need to be incorporated into the model . for example , inclusion of the initial state interaction ( isi ) would not only change the magnitude of the total cross sections , but it can also change the relative phase of the amplitudes and thus change the results of the polarization observables ( for a recent discussion of the effect of the isi on inelastic @xmath13 scattering we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also there might be significantly more complicated reaction mechanisms that contribute to the production .",
    "so far there is practically no information on the preferred production mechanism of the @xmath5 . in the only model calculation that has presented results for polarization observables @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the production reaction is dominated by kaon exchange . however , the apparently rather narrow width of the @xmath5(1540 ) @xcite , which implies a fairly small @xmath73 coupling constant , makes it plausible that other production mechanisms should be important if not dominant .",
    "one of the obvious candidates is the exchange of the @xmath74(892 ) vector meson , whose contribution has been already considered in several model calculations .",
    "vector - meson exchanges yield structures that are similar but of opposite character to those generated by pseudoscalar mesons ( kaons ) so that cancellations can occur .",
    "for example , in the @xmath13 system the cancellation between the @xmath19- and @xmath75-exchange contributions leads to a significant reduction of the tensor force ; the same feature is also seen for the @xmath76- and @xmath74 exchange in the hyperon - nucleon case @xcite . in the reaction @xmath77 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a strong cancellation between @xmath76- and @xmath74 exchange in the spin - spin component , resulting in a strong suppression of the spin - singlet amplitude as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to assume that cancellations can also occur in the @xmath5 production reaction .",
    "although there might well be more complicated production mechanisms for the @xmath5 of relevance @xcite , we believe that the model of a single kaon exchange ( fig . [ diags]a ) ) , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , or of a single @xmath74 exchange ( fig .",
    "[ diags]b ) ) or a combination of both , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is well suited to explore the model dependence of those observables relevant for the parity determination .",
    "we use the following lagrangian densities to calculate the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diags ] : @xmath78k^{*\\mu } + h.c . ,",
    "\\label{nk*theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and , @xmath81 .",
    "the superscript @xmath82 refers to the positive @xmath83 or negative @xmath84 parity of the @xmath5 .",
    "we also introduce a monopole form factor , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , at each vertex , where @xmath87 denotes the squared four  momentum of the exchanged meson @xmath88 and @xmath89 stands for its mass .",
    "the parameter values employed in our calculations are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "most of them are in the same range as the values employed / extracted in refs .",
    "the only exception is the cut  off parameter @xmath90 .",
    "we use @xmath91 gev instead of 1 gev employed in refs .",
    "@xcite , because the latter choice suppresses the @xmath74 exchange contribution almost completely .",
    "in addition , we varied the @xmath74 tensor coupling in order to exhibit various scenarios .",
