    "this review addresses an extended form of the bcs theory of superfluidity ( or superconductivity ) known as  bcs - bose einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover theory \" .",
    "here we contemplate a generalization of the standard mean field description of superfluids now modified so that one allows attractive interactions of arbitrary strength . in this way",
    "one describes how the system smoothly goes from being a superfluid system of the bcs type ( where the attraction is arbitrarily weak ) to a bose einstein condensate of diatomic molecules ( where the attraction is arbitrarily strong ) .",
    "one , thereby , sees that bcs theory is intimately connected to bec .",
    "attractive interactions between fermions are needed to form  bosonic - like \" molecules ( called cooper pairs ) which then are driven statistically to bose condense .",
    "bcs theory is a special case in which the condensation and pair formation temperatures coincide .",
    "the importance of obtaining a generalization of bcs theory which addresses the crossover from bcs to bec at general temperatures @xmath3 can not be overestimated .",
    "bcs theory as originally postulated can be viewed as a paradigm among theories of condensed matter systems ; it is complete , in many ways generic and model independent , and well verified experimentally . the observation that a bcs - like approach goes beyond strict bcs theory",
    ", suggests that there is a larger mean field theory to be addressed .",
    "equally exciting is the possibility that this mean field theory can be discovered and simultaneously tested in a very controlled fashion using ultracold fermionic atoms .",
    "we presume here that it may also have applicability to other short coherence length materials , such as the high temperature superconductors .",
    "this review is written in order to convey important new developments from one subfield of physics to another . here",
    "it is hoped that we will communicate the recent excitement felt by the cold atom community to condensed matter physicists . conversely we wish to communicate a comparable excitement in studies of high temperature superconductivity to atomic physicists .",
    "there has been a revolution in our understanding of ultracold fermions in traps in the last few years .",
    "the milestones in this research were the creation of a degenerate fermi gas ( 1999 ) , the formation of dimers of fermions ( 2003 ) , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of these dimers ( late 2003 ) and finally superfluidity of fermionic pairs ( 2004 ) .",
    "in high temperature superconductors the bcs - bec crossover picture has been investigated for many years now .",
    "it leads to a particular interpretation of a fascinating , but not well understood phase , known as the  pseudogap state \" . in the cold atom system",
    ", this crossover description is not just a scenario , but has been realized in the laboratory .",
    "this is because one has the ability ( via feshbach resonances ) to apply magnetic fields in a controlled way to tune the strength of the attraction .",
    "we note , finally , that research in this field has not been limited exclusively to the two communities .",
    "one has seen the application of these crossover ideas to studies of excitons in solids @xcite , to nuclear physics @xcite and to particle physics @xcite as well .",
    "there are not many problems in physics which have as great an overlap with different subfield communities as this  bcs - bec crossover problem \" .",

    "these alternative theories are summarized and compared in section iv .",
    "sections v and vi , respectively , present the physical implications of crossover physics , in one particular rendition , in the context of ultracold fermionic superfluids and high temperature superconductors .",

    "the pg ( pseudogap ) case corresponds to non - fermi liquid based superconductivity , and @xmath25 corresponds to critical coupling for forming a two fermion bound state in vacuum , as in eq .",

    "[ fig:2a ] , which indicates the bcs and bec regimes . in the weak coupling regime @xmath26 and ordinary bcs theory results .",
    "however at sufficiently strong coupling , @xmath7 begins to decrease , eventually crossing zero and then ultimately becoming negative in the bec regime , with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "we generally view @xmath28 as a crossing point . for positive",
    "@xmath7 the system has a remnant fermi surface , and we say that it is  fermionic \" . for negative @xmath7 , the fermi surface is gone and the material is  bosonic \" .    _",
    "the new and largely unexplored physics of this problem lies in the fact that once outside the bcs regime , but before bec , superconductivity or superfluidity emerge out of a very exotic , non - fermi liquid normal state_. indeed , it should be clear that fermi liquid theory must break down somewhere in the intermediate regime , as one goes continuously from fermionic to bosonic statistics .",
    "this intermediate case has many names :  resonant superfluidity \" , the  unitary regime \" or , as we prefer ( because it is more descriptive of the many body physics ) the  pseudogap ( pg ) regime \" .",
    "the pg regime plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] is drawn so that its boundary on the left coincides with the onset of an appreciable excitation gap at @xmath1 , called @xmath29 ; its boundary on the right coincides with where @xmath30 .",
    "this non - fermi liquid based superconductivity has been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "fermi liquid theory is inappropriate here principally because there is a gap for creating fermionic excitations .",
    "the non - fermi liquid like behavior is reflected in that of the fermionic spectral function @xcite which has a two - peak structure in the normal state , broadened somewhat , but rather similar to its counterpart in bcs theory .",
    "importantly , the onset of superconductivity occurs in the presence of fermion pairs , which reflect this excitation gap . unlike their counterparts in the bec limit",
    ", these pairs are not infinitely long lived .",
    "their presence is apparent even in the normal state where an energy must be applied to create fermionic excitations .",
    "this energy cost derives from the breaking of the metastable pairs .",
    "thus we say that there is a  pseudogap \" at and above @xmath1 .",
    "but pseudogap effects are not restricted to this normal state .",
    "pre - formed pairs have a natural counterpart in the superfluid phase , as noncondensed pairs .",
    "it will be stressed throughout this review that gaps in the fermionic spectrum and bosonic degrees of freedom are two sides of the same coin .",
    "a particularly important observation to make is that the starting point for crossover physics is based on the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "bosonic degrees of freedom are deduced from these ; they are not primary .",
    "a nonzero value of the excitation gap @xmath31 is equivalent to the presence of metastable or stable fermion pairs . and",
    "it is only in this indirect fashion that we can probe the presence of these  bosons \" , within the framework of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) .    in many ways this crossover theory appears to represent a more generic form of superfluidity . without doing any calculations we can anticipate some of the effects of finite temperature . except for very weak coupling , _ pairs form and condense at different temperatures_. the bcs limit",
    "might be viewed as the anomaly . because the attractive interaction is presumed to be arbitrarily weak , in bcs the normal state is unaffected by @xmath5 and superfluidity",
    "appears precipitously , that is without warning at @xmath1 . more generally , in the presence of a moderately strong attractive interaction it pays energetically to take some advantage and to form pairs ( say roughly at temperature @xmath32 ) within the normal state .",
    "then , for statistical reasons these bosonic degrees of freedom ultimately are driven to condense at @xmath33 , just as in bec .",
    "just as there is a distinction between @xmath1 and @xmath32 , _ there must be a distinction between the superconducting order parameter @xmath34 and the excitation gap @xmath31_. the presence of a normal state excitation gap or pseudogap for fermions is inextricably connected to this generalized bcs wavefunction . in figure",
    "[ fig : delta_deltasc ] we present a schematic plot of these two energy parameters .",
    "it may be seen that the order parameter vanishes at @xmath1 , as in a second order phase transition , while the excitation gap turns on smoothly below @xmath32 .",
    "it should also be stressed that there is only one gap energy scale in the ground state @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) .",
    "thus at zero temperature @xmath35    in addition to the distinction between @xmath31 and @xmath34 , another important way in which _ bosonic degrees of freedom are revealed is indirectly through the temperature dependence of @xmath31 . in the bec regime",
    "where fermion pairs are pre - formed , @xmath31 is essentially constant for all @xmath36 ( as is @xmath7)_. by contrast in the bcs regime it exhibits the well known temperature dependence of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that bosonic degrees of freedom are only present in the condensate for this latter case .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",

    "the excitations of the system must smoothly evolve from fermionic in the bcs regime to bosonic in the bec regime_. in the intermediate case , the excitations are a mix of fermions and meta - stable pairs .",

    "this schematic figure will play an important role in our thinking throughout this review . in the bcs and bec regimes one",
    "is led to an excitation spectrum with a single component . for the pg case",
    "it is clear that the excitations now have two distinct ( albeit , strongly interacting ) components",
    ".      this review deals with the intersection of two fields and two important problems : high temperature superconductors and ultracold fermionic atoms in which , through feshbach resonance effects , the attractive interaction may be arbitrarily tuned by a magnetic field .",
    "our focus is on the broken symmetry phase and how it evolves from the well known ground state at @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "we begin with a brief overview @xcite of pseudogap effects in the hole doped high temperature superconductors .",
    "a study of concrete data in these systems provides a rather natural way of building intuition about non - fermi liquid based superfluidity , and this should , in turn , be useful for the cold atom community .    ; whereas for the latter , the gap is very large and essentially temperature independent.,width=326 ]    . the excitations are primarily fermionic bogoliubov quasiparticles in the bcs limit and bosonic pairs ( or  feshbach bosons \" ) in the bec limit . in the pg case",
    "the  virtual molecules \" consist primarily of `` cooper '' pairs of fermionic atoms . ]",
    "it has been argued by some @xcite that a bcs - bec crossover - induced pseudogap is the origin of the mysterious normal state gap observed in high temperature superconductors .",
    "although , this is a highly contentious subject , a principal supporting rationale is that this above-@xmath1 excitation gap seems to evolve smoothly into the fermionic gap within the superconducting state .",
    "this , in conjunction with a panoply of normal state anomalies which appear to represent precursor superconductivity effects , suggests that the pseudogap has more in common with the superconducting phase than with the insulating magnetic phase associated with the parent compound .",
    "superfluid density ( upper axis ) for various superconductors .",
    "the plot indicates how `` exotic '' superconductors appear to be in a distinct category as compared with more conventional metal superconductors such as nb , sn , al and zn .",
    "note the logarithmic scales . ]",
    "the arguments in favor of this ( albeit , controversial ) crossover viewpoint rest on the following observations : ( i ) the transition temperature is anomalously high and the coherence length @xmath22 for superconductivity anomalously short , around @xmath40  as compared more typically with @xmath41 .",
    "( ii ) these systems are quasi - two dimensional so that one might expect pre - formed pairs or precursor superconductivity effects to be enhanced . (",
    "iii ) the normal state gap has the same @xmath42-wave symmetry as the superconducting order parameter @xcite , and ( iv ) to a good approximation its onset temperature , called @xmath32 , satisfies @xcite @xmath43 which satisfies the bcs scaling relation .",
    "( v ) there is widespread evidence for pseudogap effects both above @xcite and below @xcite @xmath1 .",
    "finally , it has also been argued that short coherence length superconductors may quite generally exhibit a distinctive form of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows a plot of data collected by uemura which seems to suggest that the traditional bcs superconductors stand apart from other more exotic ( and frequently short @xmath22 ) forms of superconductivity . from this plot",
    "one can infer , that , except for high @xmath1 , there is nothing special about the high @xmath1 superconductors ; they are not alone in this distinctive class which includes the organics and heavy fermion superconductors as well .",
    "thus , to understand them , one might want to focus on this simplest aspect ( short @xmath22 ) of high @xmath1 superconductors , rather than invoke more exotic and less generic features .    in fig .",

    "although the normal state calculations have not been done in detail , once the temperature is less than @xmath32 , pseudogap effects associated with the fermionic contribution will also lead to a progressive narrowing in the drude peak with decreasing @xmath2 , down to @xmath1 , due to the opening of an excitation gap .",
    "this mechanism ( which is widely ascribed to @xcite in the literature ) reflects longer lived electronic states , associated with the opening of this gap .",
    "however , it can not be applied to explain the progressive narrowing of the conductivity peaks , once @xmath64 becomes temperature independent , as is the case at low @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", one can see that pseudogap effects show up in the optical conductivity of underdoped samples , both from the fermionic contributions ( near and below @xmath32 ) and the bosonic contributions ( below @xmath1 ) as a narrowing of the drude peak .",

    "strikingly there is no explicit  gap feature \" in the optical conductivity in the normal state .",
    "such a gap feature , that is a near vanishing of @xmath69 for an extended range of frequencies , will occur in models where the pseudogap is unrelated to superconductivity ; it is not seen experimentally , thus far    by contrast with the electrical conductivity , the thermal conductivity is dominated by the fermionic contributions at essentially all @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the bosonic contribution to the heat current ( as in standard tdgl theory @xcite ) , is negligibly small , reflecting the low energy scales of the bosons .",
    "thermal conductivity , experiments @xcite in the high @xmath1 superconductors provide some of the best evidence for the presence of fermionic @xmath42-wave quasiparticles below @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the ac conductivity , here one sees a universal low @xmath2 limit @xcite , and there is little to suggest that something other than conventional @xmath42-wave bcs physics is going on here .",
    "this can not quite be the case however , since in the pseudogap regime , the temperature dependence of the fermionic excitation gap is highly anomalous , as shown in fig .",

    "the existence of noncondensed pair states below @xmath1 affects thermodynamics , in the same way that electrodynamics is affected , as discussed above .",
    "moreover , one can predict @xcite that the @xmath328 dispersion will lead to ideal bose gas power laws in thermodynamical and transport properties .",
    "these will be present in addition to the usual power laws or ( for @xmath15-wave ) exponential temperature dependences associated with the fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "note that the @xmath328 dependence reflects the spatial extent @xmath183 , of the composite pairs , and this size effect has no natural counterpart in true bose systems .",

    "a detailed set of studies was conducted , ( based on the bec - bcs scenario ) , of pair - breaking in the presence of impurities @xcite and of magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "the phase diagram of fig .  [ fig:23 ] which mirrors its experimental counterpart , shows the very different , even competing nature of @xmath32 and @xmath1 , despite the fact that both arise from the same pairing correlations .",
    "much attention is given to the anomalous behavior of the nernst coefficient in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "this coefficient is rather simply related to the transverse thermoelectric coefficient @xmath70 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:11c ] . in large part",

    "if the system were a fermi liquid , there are arguments to prove that the nernst coefficient should be essentially zero .",
    "hence the observation of a non - negligible nernst contribution has led to the picture of normal state vortices .",
    "another way to view these data is that there are bosonic degrees of freedom present in the normal state , as in the bcs - bec crossover approach . to describe this dynamics we begin with the tdgl scheme outlined in sec .",
