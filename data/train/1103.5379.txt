    "the most widely considered theory of 2d melting is the so - called kthny theory of kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , halperin and nelson @xcite , and young @xcite , which predicts that melting in two dimensions occurs via two continuous phase transitions , first from solid to hexatic fluid , and then from hexatic fluid to isotropic fluid .",
    "this theory begins from the fact that true translational order can not exist at any non - zero temperature in 2d because of the infrared divergence caused by the zero point motion of long - wave - length density fluctuations . according to the kthny theory , another form of true long - range order exists below some non - zero temperature @xmath6 where only the directions of the nearest - neighbor bonds order",
    "this long - range bond order disappears above @xmath6 because of dislocation unbinding which leads to an intermediate phase , the hexatic phase , characterized by topological order , where while dislocations are unbound , disclinations with opposite topological charge remain bound .",
    "these disclinations become unbound at a higher temperature @xmath7 where the system becomes an isotropic disordered fluid .",
    "simulation of melting in classical two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems has been tackled by means of a variety of computational studies@xcite for several decades without reaching a definite conclusion regarding its nature . in particular for hard disks in 2d , a large number of computer simulation studies have been applied to understand 2d melting , since this is the toy model on which the metropolis monte carlo method itself was first introduced@xcite and soon afterward , the 2d melting of hard disks was studied@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for the difficulty to reach an unequivocal conclusion is that in 2d a conventional solid with true translational order can not exist , and , instead the correlations decay very slowly over long distance .",
    "this requires large size systems where the relaxation time scales become very long for these types of phenomena .",
    "in particular for hard disk systems , when using a local updating algorithm or even molecular dynamics , particles remain stuck in their local `` cage '' for large computational time scales , precisely because of the hard disk constraint .",
    "one might think that monte carlo simulation of soft - core potentials , such as the lennard - jones system in 2d , might not be plagued by the same level of computational severity as the hard - disk systems , because of the softening of the hard - core constraint . as a matter of fact",
    "there are a number of studies of the lennard - jones solid@xcite by computer simulation where also a general consensus about the nature of melting has not been established .",
    "some studies have favored a first - order transition from solid to liquid @xcite , as predicted by the grain boundary melting suggestion@xcite , while other studies @xcite have leaned toward the kthny theory .",
    "the most thorough of these studies , however , are at least one decade old and because of the fact that the computational resource constraints of today are significantly better , a more thorough study should be possible .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the nature of melting of a two dimensional ( 2d ) lennard - jones solid using large scale monte carlo simulation .",
    "we use systems of up to 102,400 particles to capture the decay of the correlation functions associated with translational as well as the bond - orientational order .",
    "we find that to carry out thorough investigations beyond these sizes , calculations using the metropolis local update become impractical using today s high performance computing because of the long relaxation time scales .",
    "further technical details of our simulation are described in the next section , and the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ defects ]",
    "we discuss the role of defects in the kthny theory of melting and present the results of a geometric defect analysis . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] , we give a brief summary of our main findings and conclusions .",
    "in the lennard - jones potential , for two particles separated by a distance @xmath19 , @xmath20 an attractive inverse sixth power tail is combined with a repulsive inverse twelfth power hard core , such that there are only two parameters : @xmath21 , the potential well depth , and @xmath22 , the hard - core diameter . however",
    ", our results can be inferred for any particular value of these parameters ( for a specific real system ) , since in our calculations , distance is measured in units of @xmath22 and temperature in units of @xmath23 .",
    "in our calculations we have truncated the lennard - jones potential at a distance of 3@xmath22 , and shifted the value of the potential within this cutoff distance by a constant so that the resulting potential approaches zero at 3@xmath22 ( matching the values beyond 3@xmath22 ) .",
    "this truncation is justified because the lennard - jones potential is already quite small ( -0.005@xmath21 ) at this distance , and is not expected to significantly affect the accuracy of our simulations . additionally , by using a cutoff distance , we are able to use a cell list structure in our algorithms so that our computations scale as @xmath24 instead of the @xmath25 scaling without a cutoff distance ( @xmath26 is the number of particles in our simulation cell ) .",
    "we have collected data for systems of 1600 , 6400 , and 25600 particles over a wide temperature range at a density of 0.873 . additionally , we have simulated a system of 102400 particles for three temperature values at the same density in order to verify our results for the smaller system sizes . to accommodate the expected low temperature triangular solid phase , a periodic simulation cell of proportion 2:@xmath27 is used .",
    "we have performed our calculations on the florida state university shared high - performance computing facility , which contains several thousand compute nodes .",
    "the processors on these nodes range in speed from 2.3 ghz to 2.8 ghz , and it takes about 34 hours to perform 1,000,000 monte carlo sweeps for @xmath28 particles , including calculating observables every 100 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) .",
    "we have found that , except for the @xmath29 particle system , a million mcs are sufficient to reach equilibrium , even near the critical points .",
    "the data presented here is obtained over one million mcs , after a period of one ( for @xmath29 ) or two ( for @xmath30 , and 25600 ) million mcs of equilibration .    to take advantage of our computational resources , we utilized a trivially parallel monte carlo implementation of 100 threads , each with a unique random number seed and initial configuration",
    ". simulations begin from an initial near - ordered configuration ( particles are placed in a triangular lattice , with 5% lattice spacing random fluctuations ) .",
    "statistics for thermodynamic variables are collected by generating averages on each of the 100 parallel threads , then using the central limit theorem we obtain the total average , as we have 100 independent means .",
    "although in our preliminary studies we have computed thermodynamic quantities for a range of densities and temperatures , the effects of critical slowing down near the melting transition and our desire to study the largest possible systems have led us to focus on a single density , 0.873 ( all densities are in units of particles per @xmath31 ) .",
    "this density was chosen for several reasons .",
    "this is a density that could be readily compared to prior numerical simulations of lennard - jones melting @xcite . also , we wanted a density that is relatively low , but large enough to avoid the solid - vapor coexistence phase at low temperatures . strictly speaking ,",
    "there is a solid phase in the zero temperature limit only at densities of 0.9165 ( the density at which the spacing of the triangular lattice is the same as the position of the lennard - jones potential minimum ) and above . below this density",
    "there is a solid - vapor coexistence phase .",
    "however , the triple point density is roughly 0.82 , so at higher densities the system will in general become solid before the onset of melting occurs @xcite .",
    "in two dimensions , the densest packing of particles of uniform size is achieved in a triangular lattice . in such a configuration , each particle has exactly six nearest neighbors .",
    "thermal fluctuations will lead to distortions in the lattice , or even destroy it completely . to quantify this",
    ", we use the delaunay triangulation to determine the nearest neighbor network of our particle configurations .",
    "the nearest neighbor network tells us the number of nearest neighbors , or coordination number , of each particle . for a system of particles in a periodic plane , the average coordination number is always six @xcite .",
    "particles in a triangularly ordered region will be six - coordinated , while disruptions in the lattice will lead to particles with coordination numbers greater than or less than six .",
    "a defect is defined as any coordination number other than six .",
    "these non - six - coordinated atoms may be thought of as disclinations of charge @xmath32 , their coordination number being @xmath33 .",
    "the most common type of disruption , or defect , is a five- or seven - coordinated particle .",
    "these may be interpreted as disclinations of charge plus or minus one .",
    "two oppositely charged disclinations may be thought of as a dislocation .",
    "more complex arrangements of disclinations are possible , such as dislocation pairs and grain boundary loops , but in our analysis we have only considered individual defects .",
    "the defect fraction , @xmath34 , is defined as the fraction of particles that do not have six neighbors , where @xmath26 is the number of particles in the system , and @xmath35 is the number of six - coordinated particles in the system . remembering that dislocations are made of two bound disclinations of opposite charge , and that dislocations become unbound above the melting point",
    ", we can expect the defect fraction to experience a jump at the melting point @xcite .",
    "additionally , at low temperatures we can expect an energy gap to occur , which is the energy cost to create a dislocation pair . because the overall disclinicity of the system must be zero , as well as the net burgers vector of any dislocations , the lowest - energy defect excitation is a dislocation pair of opposite burgers vectors . in practice",
    "this is usually two pairs of 5- and 7-coordinated particles .",
    "this leads to an exponential behavior in the defect fraction , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lowest - energy for a defect type excitation of the system .      0.3 in     particles at t=0.70 .",

    "the defects are shown in red . at low temperature",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ data_net070 ] , we see that defects occur in quadruplets consisting of two 5-coordinated and two 7-coordinated particles . as the temperature",
    "is raised to 0.9 ( figure  [ data_net090 ] ) we can see isolated dislocations ( one 5-fold coordinated atom bound to a 7-fold coordinated atom ) . at yet higher temperature , such as 1.1 ( figure  [ data_net110 ] )",
    "we can observe isolated disclinations .",
    "this can also be seen in the pair distribution functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , for pairs of 7-coordinated particles , pairs of 5-fold coordinated atoms and for 5-fold-7-fold coordinated atoms respectively . in figure",
    "[ data_g77 ] , a sharp peak in @xmath38 is observed at low temperatures ( @xmath41 ) , indicating that dislocations are tightly bound . at higher temperatures ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , the peak in @xmath38",
    "is greatly diminished , and dislocations become first weakly bound ( @xmath42 ) and then completely unbound ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xmath39 , while not shown , behaves qualitatively similar to @xmath38 , as both are representative of the pair distribution of dislocations .    0.3 in .",

    "this indicates that disclinations have not become completely unbound , and indeed it is difficult to find isolated disclinations in the snapshot configurations presented in figure  [ data_net110 ] .",
    "when isolated disclinations do occur , they are still next - nearest neighbors with at least one other disclination of opposite charge .      0.3 in , as defined by the fraction of non - six - coordinated particles in the delaunay triangulation , @xmath46 .",
    "the rapid rise in @xmath47 from near zero to almost 25% is a possible sign that dislocation and/or disclination unbinding is occurring.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3 in    0.3 in   appears to lessen in magnitude as the system size is increased.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3 in    0.3 in , while at higher temperatures , such as t=2.00 shown above , there is a loss of order over moderate length scales.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3 in    according to the kthny theory , disclinations remain very tightly bound below @xmath6 . above @xmath6 ,",
    "the disclinations are screened from one another by the presence of free dislocations yet remain bound , albeit by a weaker logarithmic binding@xcite .",
    "thus , we expect a proliferation of defects to occur around @xmath6 , and to continue growing until somewhere above @xmath7 , where a saturation should occur . in figure  [ data_defects ]",
    "we show the average defect fraction as a function of temperature . at low temperature , there are very few defects , while at high temperature there is a considerable fraction of the system that is defected . in between",
    ", there is a region of rapidly increasing defect fraction , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "this can be quantitatively verified by calculating the temperature derivative of the defect fraction , which is indeed found to have a broad peak in this temperature region .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath50 is very similar to that of the specific heat capacity , to be shown next .",
    "additionally , we can see some size dependence in the region @xmath51 , although this seems to be an issue mostly for comparisons of the smallest system size ( @xmath52 ) to the larger system sizes .",
    "the specific heat per particle at constant volume , @xmath53 , can be calculated from the energy fluctuations , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total energy of an @xmath26 particle system .",
    "we have calculated the specific heat and show it as a function of temperature in figure  [ data_specific_heat ] .",
    "one can see a broad peak in the specific heat per particle . according to the kthny theory",
    ", there should be an essential singularity in the specific heat at both @xmath6 and @xmath7@xcite . however , it is not clear whether this will be visible above background contributions to the specific heat .",
    "either way , the peak in specific heat points to a rearrangement of order in the systems studied .",
    "also , if we look at the distribution function ( figure  [ data_distrib ] ) , we see ordering at low temperatures , and fluid behavior at high temperatures .",
    "overall , it is clear that there is a phase transition occurring , with a disordered fluid state at high temperatures and an ordered state at low temperatures .      in the kthny theory ,",
    "dislocations are bound at low temperatures , and there is a defect core energy associated with their creation .",
    "this leads to an energy gap , and thus using the arrhenius law , we expect @xmath56 , where we have used @xmath57 because dislocation pairs are the lowest energy excitation ( isolated dislocations are forbidden ) . in table  [ table1 ] we show the defect activation energy as calculated by the arrhenius law at low temperatures . taking the low temperature limit , we find @xmath58 .    .defect activation energy for various system sizes and temperatures , as computed using the arrhenius law .",

    "let us define a global order parameter of translational order , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a reciprocal lattice vector , and @xmath61 is the position vector of particle @xmath62 .",
    "if there is translational ordering in a system , then clearly @xmath63 will be non - zero if @xmath60 is a reciprocal lattice vector of the appropriate lattice geometry .",
    "due to the shape of our simulational cell , at low temperatures this will be a triangular lattice with nearest - neighbors in the x - direction . at high temperatures ,",
    "no translational ordering is present , and all possible values of @xmath60 should give the same ( qualitative ) result .",
    "however , at intermediate temperatures , it may be possible for there to be some degree of translational ordering that is not strictly commensurate with our simulation cell .",
    "indeed , we have observed `` canted '' solid phases at intermediate temperatures , where we find partial triangular order with nearest neighbors in a direction titled from the x - axis by a small angle . in this case , if @xmath60 for the triangular order commensurate with our simulation cell is used , @xmath63 will be found to be zero .",
    "however , if we use an appropriate @xmath60 for the order present , @xmath63 will be found to be non - zero .",
    "for this reason , we define the true translational order to be the maximum value of @xmath63 for all @xmath60 . in practice",
    ", it is not possible to perform this optimization for each monte carlo configuration , so we make the following assumptions .",
    "first , due to the nature of ordering in two dimensions , we assume any lattice will be triangular . second , because the density of particles is fixed , we assume the lattice spacing in said triangular solid to be the same as that for the commensurate cell .",
    "thus , we keep the magnitude of @xmath60 constant , and simply determine the direction of solid ordering for each configuration by looking at the average bond direction between nearest neighbor particles .",
    "this turns out to be a good estimate of the true translational order for a system , but it must be remembered that it is strictly speaking a _",
    "lower bound_.    the local order parameter which measures the degree of six - fold orientational ordering is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the angle of the bond between particles @xmath66 and @xmath62 and the sum over @xmath62 extends over all @xmath67 nearest neighboring atoms found by the delaunay triangulation .",

    "in such case @xmath72 . in the low temperature phase , there is bond - orientational order , so @xmath73 should be a point on the perimeter of a circle with a radius approaching unity as @xmath74 . in the hexatic phase there is quasi - long - range bond - orientational order , which implies that the distribution of @xmath73 should become a ring in the imaginary plane . in the isotropic phase",

    "there appears to be a transition from a translationally ordered phase at low temperatures to a disordered phase at higher temperatures . in the ordered phase there is a clear relation between @xmath77 and system size .",
    "we will explore this relation in a later section , but for now let us point out that this finite - size scaling relation begins to break down above @xmath78 .",
    "this is expected within the kthny theory of melting due to the unbinding of dislocations . however , on closer inspection , the behavior of the curves for @xmath79 and @xmath28 in the region @xmath80 is not a smooth connection of the data at higher and lower temperature .",
    "this is due to our measured quantity @xmath10 being a lower bound of translational order .",
    "also shown in figure  [ data_psi2 ] is the second moment of the bond orientational order parameter , @xmath81 ( bottom panel ) . at low temperatures",
    "there is substantial bond orientational order .",
    "below @xmath82 there is very little dependence of @xmath81 on system size . as the temperature",
    "is increased , @xmath81 begins to show a marked dependence on system size as well as a steep decline in value as we approach the high temperature disordered phase .",
    "the main prediction of halperin and nelson@xcite and young@xcite is that if two dimensional melting is the result of dislocation unbinding , as proposed by kosterlitz and thouless@xcite , then a second unbinding transition ( of disclinations ) is required to reach an isotropic fluid state .",
    "this implies the presence of a novel hexatic fluid phase . in figure  [ data_psimaginary ]",

    "the translational critical exponent is bounded at lower melting temperature : @xmath89 .",

    "a central concept in finite - size scaling theory is that any dimensionless quantity should be a function of dimensionless ratios of the finite - size length ( @xmath87 ) of the system to the correlation length @xmath4 which emerges naturally and it diverges near the critical point  @xcite .",
    "therefore , close enough to the critical point a dimensionless quantity becomes a scaling function @xmath176 . at precisely the critical point , where the correlation length diverges",
    ", all dimensionless quantities are expected to be independent of the system size .",
    "a straightforward way to construct a dimensionless variable is to take the ratio of cumulants .",
    "a simple non - trivial ratio is the so - called binder ratio  @xcite of the fourth and second cumulants , @xmath177 as mentioned above , this ( dimensionless ) variable is expected to be system - size independent at a critical point .",
    "hence , if the values of @xmath178 for several system sizes are plotted across a continuous phase transition , they should cross at the critical point .",
    "this is the standard way of estimating for example the critical temperature of a thermal phase transition using the method of binder ratios .    in the case of melting in two dimensions ,",
    "however , we have seen that there are two correlation lengths : one for translational order , and another for bond orientational order .",
    "clearly , if we approach very close to either @xmath7 or @xmath7 only one of these two correlation lengths dominates .",
    "for example if we approach @xmath6 sufficiently close from above , @xmath152 becomes very large and @xmath99 is infinite .",
    "thus , there is only one finite correlation length .",
    "when we approach @xmath7 from above , both @xmath99 and @xmath152 are finite , but if we are sufficiently close to @xmath7 , @xmath179 and so we can neglect the influence of @xmath152 . in practice , however , because @xmath99 grows very rapidly as the temperature @xmath7 is approached and we can only study finite - size size systems , the size of @xmath152 is not necessarily negligible as compared to the size of @xmath99 .",

    "@xmath152 is still finite when @xmath181 diverges at the upper critical temperature , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the binder ratio would only be expected to have a crossing at @xmath18 if @xmath182 , which is not the case for the system sizes we have considered ( @xmath183 , half the length of the smallest system size ) . however , depending on the exact form of the scaling function , there may still be a crossing in the vicinity of @xmath18 .    0.3 in   near the crossing temperature , @xmath184.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3 in    looking at the binder ratio in figure  [ abind ]",
    ", we can see that there is an apparent crossing of @xmath185 at @xmath186 .",
    "although our statistical uncertainty is too great to identify the system - size dependence of the binder ratio crossing ( see inset ) , the finite - size scaling theory outlined above indicates that @xmath184 should approach @xmath18 when @xmath182 .",
    "thus , while we could use the value of @xmath184 as an estimate of @xmath18 , the method obtained earlier for critical exponents is expected to yield more accurate results to the system sizes considered here .    while we have also calculated @xmath187 , the shortfalls of our estimator for translational order in the temperature region @xmath188 lead to an inconclusive analysis of the binder crossing .",
    "lastly , let us point out that the finite - size scaling theory discussed in this section should be applicable to any dimensionless parameter . in sec .",
    "[ correlations ] we demonstrated the scaling collapse of the quantity @xmath189 when plotted as a function of @xmath190 . in light of the analysis above , it is clear that we have neglected the @xmath152 dependence of this dimensionless quantity . in figure  [ data_xi ] we can see that for @xmath191 @xmath152 is more or less constant ( @xmath192 ) . but as @xmath18 is approached , @xmath152 increases more rapidly , such that @xmath193 .",
    "this could explain the scatter seen in the scaling collapse of @xmath189 shown in figure  [ fss_bond ] .",
    "we have shown that several key predictions from the kthny theory of two - stage continuous melting are seen in the classical system of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles in two dimensions .",
    "first , using delaunay triangulation we can define disclinations and dislocations and this allows us to investigate the role of defects in the 2d melting process .",
    "we can clearly observe at low temperature that disclinations of 5-fold coordinates atoms and disclinations of 7-fold coordinated atoms are bound into dislocations which themselves are bound into dislocation pairs . near @xmath6 we begin to see unbound dislocations and at a higher temperature we begin to observe unbinding of disclinations .",
    "the derivative with respect to temperature of the total defect fraction exhibits a broad peak near @xmath194 very similar to the specific heat peak .",
    "near this temperature we find that the short - range peak ( main peak ) of the pair distribution function of the 5-fold coordinated atoms and that of the 7-fold coordinated atoms greatly diminishes .",
    "the pair distribution function of 5-fold-7-fold coordinated particles also decreases greatly at roughly the same temperature .",
    "we calculated the distribution of the order parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the complex plane .",
    "below @xmath6 , we see the characteristic `` mexican hat''-like circularly symmetric distribution for @xmath0 , i.e. , while the magnitude of @xmath0 is finite below @xmath6 , its phase fluctuates causing the system to lose its translational order .",
    "the orientational order parameter , @xmath1 , however , remains frozen to a particular direction below @xmath6 because the system is large enough to allow , for all practical purposes , for such a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in the temperature range @xmath195 , the `` mexican - hat''-like distribution of @xmath0 collapses to a distribution around zero , while the distribution of @xmath1 becomes `` mexican - hat''-like .",
    "this could serve as a textbook description of the hexatic order .",
    "for @xmath137 the distribution of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are centered around zero value .",
    "we also calculated the temperature dependence of the second moment of the above two order parameters for various size systems and from the size - dependence of the results we have extracted the anomalous dimensions , i.e. , the critical exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the correlation functions @xmath196 and @xmath197 of the order parameter @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "we find that both are controlled by two characteristic correlation lengths , one is @xmath4 , which characterizes the decay of the correlation of the atomic positions and the other is @xmath5 , which provides the decay of the bond - orientation correlations .",
    "we demonstrate that we can accurately extract both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the two correlation lengths @xmath5 and @xmath4 have very different temperature dependence , each diverging as we lower the temperature at two different characteristic critical temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath6 respectively , obtained by fitting the calculated correlation length to the forms suggested by kthny theory .",
    "furthermore , using the calculated correlation length and critical exponent @xmath9 , we find that the dimensionless quantity @xmath134 as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath133 for all size - lattice considered here collapse onto the same scaling function . a similar conclusion is also reached for the finite - size scaling of the corresponding quantities related to the translational order , i.e. , @xmath198 versus @xmath164 .",
