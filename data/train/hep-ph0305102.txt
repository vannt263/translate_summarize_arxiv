    "quarkonium production and decays have long been considered as an ideal means to investigate the bound - state formation in qcd .",
    "due to its approximately non - relativistic nature , the description of the heavy quark and anti - quark system is one of the simplest applications of qcd .",
    "for example , the calculation of quarkonium leptonic decays render experimental results with a high precision , which may play a crucial role in investigating various phenomena such as measuring the parton distribution , detecting the quark - gluon - plasma signal and even new physics .",
    "while the quarkonium physics has been studied for more than twenty years , the recent interest in the field has been focused on the colour - octet scenario @xcite which was triggered by the high-@xmath13 @xmath0 surplus production discovered by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron in 1992 @xcite .",
    "it was proposed based on a novel effective theory , the non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "having achieved the first - step of explaining the cdf data , the colour - octet mechanism(com ) had a strong impact into the quarkonium physics and various efforts have been made to confirm this mechanism .",
    "although the theoretical framework seems to show qualitative agreements with experimental data , there are certain difficulties in the quantitative estimate of the colour - octet contribution @xcite , in particular , in hera physics @xcite .",
    "it was in such circumstances that the b factory experiments reported their first result on the prompt charmonium production from @xmath14 collider at @xmath15 gev @xcite .",
    "as far as hadronic uncertainty is concerned , the b factories would provide clearer information of the quarkonium production .",
    "the first result for the inclusive @xmath16 process from belle ( with @xmath17 data set ) indicated a discrepancy from the theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 process seemed to dominate the threshold region ( @xmath19 ) of the energy spectra of the differential cross section comparing to the com process @xmath20 and colour - singlet process @xmath21 , contrary to the theoretical expectation in @xcite . in their second report ( based on @xmath22 data set ) @xcite ,",
    "the direct measurement of the @xmath18 process is presented simultaneously and it is found that experimental result is about 10 times larger than the theoretical prediction for this process . in @xcite ,",
    "the total cross section of the exclusive @xmath23 process is found to be : @xmath24 note that the observed number of events for @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "motivated by this measurement , we investigate @xmath25 production at @xmath14 colliders .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we will give all the formulae used in our analysis .",
    "motivated by the observed large cross section of the @xmath25 production by belle , we further consider the heavy quarkonium pair production at lep energies .",
    "for this purpose , we include the formulae for the @xmath6 intermediated processes . in sec . 3 ,",
    "our numerical results are presented . the double @xmath0 production through @xmath27 intermediated states which has been proposed as an explanation of the large cross section of the @xmath25 process  @xcite is also examined .",
    "finally we give our summary and conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section , we give the formulae which we use in the following sections : the @xmath14 annihilation into a pair of @xmath28 charmonium- and bottomonium - sates .",
    "we use the standard method in our calculation : we start from the double @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) production amplitudes , and project out the heavy quark and anti - quark pairs into the s - wave states in the colour - singlet ( see fig .",
    "the spin projection operator for the quarkonium production is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are respectively the quarkonium four - momentum , its spin and the @xmath35 component of the spin ; @xmath36 is the relative momentum of the heavy quarks ; and @xmath37 , @xmath38 represent their spins . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the covariant forms of the projection operators are very simple : @xmath39 respectively , for the pseudoscalar and the vector quarkonium . here",
    "@xmath40 denotes the polarization vector of the spin-1 quarkonium state , and @xmath41 is the mass of the quarkonium .",
    "projectors ( [ proj0 ] ) and ( [ proj1 ] ) map a @xmath42 pair into the s - wave states . in the rest frame of the vector meson ,",
    "the polarization vector is given by @xmath43 for the longitudinal and transverse polarizations , respectively .",
    "we need to boost the polarisation vector from rest frame to the laboratory system along the spin quantization axis so that @xmath34 denotes the helicity ( @xmath44 ) in the laboratory frame . in the frame where the electron beam is along the @xmath35-axis and",
    "the quarkonium scattering angle is @xmath45 , the polarization vectors read @xmath46 respectively , where @xmath47     production from @xmath48 annihilation.,width=566 ]    now let us show our analytical formulae for the cross sections . the helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath49",

    "the initial current is given as @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the four momentum of vector and pseudoscalar mesons , respectively .",
    "the vector and axial - vector couplings of the @xmath6-boson are @xmath60 where the @xmath61 is the third component of the weak isospin of the left - handed quark doublet ; @xmath62 is the @xmath54 charge in units of proton charge .",
    "the absence of the @xmath63 amplitudes , the scattering angle dependence of the @xmath64 amplitudes as well as their relative sign tell us the spin parity ( @xmath65 ) of the hadronic system assigned as @xmath1 .",
    "the above predictions can be tested by experiments through the decay angular distributions of @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 ) . using a definition @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 helicity in the @xmath71 limit ( @xmath72 ) , we obtain @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath63 .",

    "the @xmath85 dependence tells us that only the transversally polarized @xmath79 are produced and the @xmath78 dependence tells us the relative phase of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 amplitudes .",
    "these predictions of the @xmath88 production processes should be tested experimentally . after integrating out the @xmath79 decay angles and the scattering angle",

    "such pairs can be produced via @xmath93 intermediate states or in the @xmath6-boson decays through its axial - vector couplings to the heavy quarks .",
    "the former process has been studied in ref .",
    "for the latter process , we find the helicity amplitudes @xmath94 where @xmath51 is the electron helicity ( in units of 1/2 ) , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the helicities of @xmath79 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , @xmath99 is the initial @xmath14 current , and @xmath100 is the momentum of @xmath79 s .",
    "from this result , one can easily find that the amplitudes for @xmath101 are zero .",
    "the absence of the @xmath102 amplitudes is in accordance with the yang s theorem ( that forbids the transition between the spin 1 state and a pair of identical massless vector bosons ) , the @xmath103 amplitude is absent due to bose symmetry  @xcite and the @xmath104 amplitudes vanish because of angular momentum mismatch .",

    "we find that the @xmath2 factor of up to about 6 can be obtained by taking account of the next - leading - order corrections to the @xmath0 leptonic width and by studying the scale dependence of the leading - order prediction . on the other hand , the experimental data may contain contributions from non-@xmath1 origin hadronic events , such as hadrons from @xmath0 decays in the @xmath0-pair production via two virtual photon exchange @xcite , and hadrons from two gluon jets in the color - singlet @xmath158 process @xcite .",
