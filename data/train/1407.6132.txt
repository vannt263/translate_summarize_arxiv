    "[ [ motivation ] ] motivation + + + + + + + + + +    the theory of _ persistent homology _ has led to a new way of understanding data through its topological properties , commonly referred as _",
    "analysis_. the most common setup assumes that the data is given as a finite set of points and analyzes the sublevel sets of the distance function to the point set .",
    "an equivalent formulation is to take offsets of the point sets with increasing offset parameter and to study the changes in the hole structure of the shape obtained by the union of the offset balls ; see figure  [ fig : barcode_example ] for an illustration and informal description .",
    "notice that we postpone the exposition of formal topology background to the next section .",
    "we pose the question how to generalize the default framework for point sets to more general input shapes .",
    "while there is no theoretical obstacle to consider distance functions from shapes rather than points ( at least for reasonably `` nice '' shapes ) , it raises computational questions : how can critical points of that distance functions be computed efficiently ? and how can the topological information be encoded in a combinatorial structure of small size ?    with the wealth of applications of persistence of point set data , and together with the challenges raised by the extension from point sets to sets of convex objects , we believe that the latter is a logical next step of investigation .",
    "our attention to this problem originates from the increasingly popular application of 3d printing .",
    "a common problem in this context is that often available models of shapes contain features that complicate the printing process , or turn it impossible altogether .",
    "a ubiquitous example is the presence of thin features which may easily break , and call for thickening .",
    "one work - around is to offset the model by a small value to stabilize it , but the optimal offset parameter is unclear , as it should get rid of many spurious features of the model without introducing too many new ones .",
    "moreover , one would prefer _ local thickening _",
    "@xcite , and possibly thickening by different offset size in different parts of the model .",
    "a by - product of our work here is a step toward automatically detecting target regions for local thickening that do not incur spurious artifacts .",
    "persistent homology provides a _ barcode _ which constitutes a summary of the hole structure of the offset shape for any parameter value ( figure  [ fig : barcode_example ] ) which is clearly helpful for the choice of a good offset value .",
    "we are especially interested in an exact method in this context because any approximate barcode ( obtained , for instance , by approximating the shapes by point set ) introduces artificial topological noise which are difficult to discern from short - ranged features .",
    "this , in turn , makes it even more difficult to choose a suitable offset radius .",
    "[ [ problem - definition - and - contribution ] ] problem definition and contribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we design , analyze , implement , and experimentally evaluate algorithms for computing persistence barcodes of convex input objects . more precisely , we concentrate on the problem of computing a _ filtration _ , a sequence of nested combinatorial cell complexes that undergoes the same topological changes as the offset shapes . since the input objects are convex , the nerve theorem asserts that the intersection patterns of the offsets ( called the _ nerve _ ) reveal the entire topological information .",
    "this leads to the generalization of _ ech _ filtrations from point sets to our scenario .",
    "the resulting filtration has a size of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of input objects contained in @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this size is already problematic for small @xmath7 and a natural idea to reduce its size is to consider _ restricted offsets _ , that is , intersecting the offset of an input object to the _ voronoi region _",
    ", the portion of the space which is closest to the object .",
    "this approach is again inspired by the analogue case of point sets , where _ alpha - complexes _ are preferred over the ech complexes for small dimensions .",
    "however , the approach for point sets does _ not _ directly carry over to arbitrary convex objects : voronoi regions of convex objects are not necessarily convex and can intersect in non - contractible patterns which prevents the application of the nerve theorem .    , and the @xmath8-barcode of the shape .",

    "the result implies the existence of a linear - sized filtration , as opposed to the cubical size obtained from using the unrestricted nerves .",
    "the filtration can be computed in time @xmath15 , ruled by the computation time of the voronoi diagram .",

    "moreover , it requires a slight generalization of a result in  @xcite ( see theorem  [ thm : nerve_inclusion_commute ] below ) , showing that the nerve isomorphism commutes with inclusions , to the case of filtrations connected by certain simplicial maps .",
    "our second result is a general construction of a cell complex with the desired barcode in three dimensions .",
    "our construction scheme computes the voronoi diagram of the input sites as a preprocessing step and cuts ( subdivides ) the lower - dimensional cells of the voronoi diagrams into smaller pieces in a controlled way .",
    "the resulting refinement of the voronoi diagram gives rise to a dual cell complex whose size is asymptotically equal to the complexity of the voronoi diagram of the input sites . as the latter is known to be bounded by @xmath16 , our filtration is significantly smaller than @xmath17 , as obtained by a ech - like filtration .",
    "the time for computing the filtration is bounded from above by @xmath16 .",
    "the correctness proof works by ( conceptually ) `` thicken up '' lower - dimensional cells of the voronoi diagram to obtain a good cover of the space , for which the nerve theorem applies .",
    "we have implemented our algorithm for polygons using the cgal library and report on extensive experimental evaluation . in particular , we compare our approach with the natural alternative to replace the input polygons with sufficiently dense point samples .",
    "although the point sample approach yields very close approximations to the exact barcode in a comparable running time , we demonstrate that the approximation error induced by the sampling results in additional noise on a large range of scales and therefore makes the topological analysis of the offset filtration more difficult .",

    "an isoline is a closed curve , the third primitive can be performed by fixing a reference point on the isoline , and then , given any two points , decide according to their clockwise order from the reference point . as each isoline",
    "is composed of a constant number of curves ( by our assumption that each polyhedra is of constant size ) , the operation can be performed in constant time .",
    "fixing a cell @xmath104 , the algorithm uses a sweep - line approach by sweeping an isoline through @xmath104 .",
    "for each critical point @xmath40 , let its _ critical value _",
    "be @xmath240 .",
    "we sort all critical points according to their critical values , and go over the critical points in an increasing order .",
    "as the sweep progresses , we maintain a list of boundary curves that the sweep isoline is currently intersecting .",
    "the key observation is that when the sweep progresses between two isolines , and since the boundary curves do not intersect in their interior , the order of intersection points of the boundary curves with the isolines remains the same , with the exception that it might get shifted .",
    "however , we can fix the reference point in the third primitive so that it remains consistent with respect to the order on the previous isolines .",
    "this allows for efficient lookup , insertion , and deletion of curves by maintaining a balanced search tree of the curves , sorted by the third primitive .",
    "the algorithm runs in two stages .",
    "the first stage creates the unbounded curve @xmath221 by simulating combinatorially a curve that has the desired properties , namely , that it is an unbounded curve that attains a minimum in @xmath222 and that is monotone otherwise .",
    "note that @xmath221 is composed of two @xmath209-monotone unbounded segments .",
    "we describe how to simulate a single segment using a sweep , and will repeat the procedure for the creation of the two segments .",
    "we start by picking a random intersection point for @xmath221 on the first isoline that we encounter in the sweep .",
    "then , at the next isoline , we assume that @xmath221 acts monotonously and pick a random intersection point such that @xmath221 does not intersect any curve in the tree .",
    "for example ,",
    "if the current intersection point is located between curves @xmath241 and @xmath242 at the current isoline , then we pick the next intersection point so that it is still located between @xmath241 and @xmath242 on the next isoline .",
    "we update the arrangement according to the choice of points by splitting the face in which the curve passes .",
    "a problem may occur when @xmath241 and @xmath242 merge , but as this must happen at a critical point , we can simply assume that @xmath221 intersects both @xmath241 and @xmath242 at that critical point , and update the arrangement accordingly . at the end of the process",
    "we obtain an arrangement that contains all the combinatorial information for the cuts induced by @xmath221 .",
    "note that as each new edge induced by @xmath221 attains a minimum over @xmath209 in its lower endpoint , we also have the critical value of the edge .",
    "the second stage of the algorithm introduces the cuts that are induced by isoline segments .",
    "we again perform a sweep over @xmath104 .",
    "when the sweep isoline hits a critical point , we look for the two curves to the sides of the intersection point in the tree , add the isoline segment bounded by those two curves to the arrangement , and split the faces accordingly .",
    "we note that it might be that the isoline segment goes in the interior of a hole . in order to handle such cases",
    ", we keep track for any two consecutive curves in the tree whether the area between them belongs to the interior of @xmath104 or not .",
    "notice that each sweep goes over @xmath236 critical values . at each critical value",
    ", a constant number of lookups , insertions and deletions is performed on the balanced search tree of curves . also , the size of the tree is bounded by the size of the voronoi diagram . therefore ,",
    "for each critical value , we perform @xmath243 operations , obtaining the following result .",
    "the offset filtration of convex , disjoint polyhedra in generic position can be computed in time @xmath244 , excluding the computation time of the voronoi diagram .",
    "together with the result of  @xcite , we obtain an upper bound of @xmath16 on the expected time .",
    "computing voronoi diagrams of polyhedra in space is a difficult problem . while efforts to compute it are underway , so far only restricted cases have been completed ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict our experiments to the planar case .",
    "still , we show that already in the plane approximating the shapes by point samples introduces noise that is hard to distinguish from real small features .    [ [ implementation - details ] ] implementation details + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we implemented the restricted nerve algorithm for the two - dimensional case as described in section  [ sec : restricted_barcodes_2d ] .",
    "the algorithm requires computing the combinatorial structure of the voronoi diagram , and the critical value of each feature of the diagram , namely what is the point on the feature that attains the minimal distance to the sites defining the feature .",
    "we solve the first task by computing the delaunay graph for all line segments belonging to the input polygons , using cgal s 2d segment delaunay graphs package  @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to features of the graph for which no two defining segments belong to the same polygon and remove duplicates . for the critical values , we explicitly compute the actual curves and vertices of the voronoi diagram and compute the minimal distance to their nearest polygonal sites .    for comparison purposes , we also implemented the unrestricted nerve filtration described in section  [ sec : barcodes_of_shapes ] . for the computation of critical values ,",
    "we proceed in a brute - force manner , that is , we take the minimum distance over all pairs or triplets of line segments of the input polygons .",
    "we also implemented an approximation of the barcode through point samples : fixing some @xmath30 , we calculate a finite point set whose hausdorff - distance to the input polygonal shapes is at most @xmath245 .",
    "we achieve that by placing a grid of side length @xmath246 in the plane and taking as our sample the centers of all grid cells which are intersected by some input polygon .",
    "we can compute this sample efficiently by taking the minkowski sum of each polygon and a square with side length @xmath247 , and performing batch point location queries for a grid of points in the bounding rectangle of that polygon .",
    "we compute the alpha - filtration on the point samples , using cgal s 2d triangulation package @xcite .",
    "the size of the resulting filtration is linear in the number of sampled points .    in all variants ,",
    "after computing the filtration , we obtain the barcode using the phat library  @xcite .

    "we added random polygons inside the square using the following repetitive process .",
    "we randomly pick a point inside the square , and create a rectangle centered at that point with a random width and height .",
    "we then randomly select 5 points inside that rectangle and take the polygon to be their convex hull .",
    "if the polygon does not intersect any of the polygons that were previously added , we add it to our input .",
    "an illustration of an input is shown in figure [ fig : quality_of_barcode ] .",
    "all experiments were run on a 3.4ghz intel core i5 processor with 8 gb of memory .",
    "the experimental results are shown in table  [ tbl : time_comprisons ] .",
    "we observe that computing the filtration takes much more time than converting the filtration into a barcode .",
    "this is in sync with the common observation that despite the worst - case cubical complexity , the barcode computation scales well in practice .",
    "moreover , we get the expected result that the unrestricted nerve yields large filtrations and high running times compared to the restricted nerve approach . in particular , for sufficiently large inputs , the time to compute the barcode from the unrestricted filtration",
    "is an order of magnitude higher than the total time in the restricted case , so even a smarter way for computing critical values will not be helpful .",
    "comparing the running time of the restricted nerve approach with that of the point sampling approach is difficult as it depends on the choice of  @xmath245 .",
    "what approximation quality is reasonable generally depends on the application and the input at hand .",
    "however , we can observe that the overhead of computing the voronoi diagrams of convex polygons instead of points is rather small , and we get the exact barcode in the same time as it would take to compute a `` reasonable '' approximation of the input .",
    "of course , it should be admitted that our simple point - sampling approach could be significantly improved by sampling only the boundary of polygons instead , and even more by making the sample density adaptive to the _ local feature size _",
    "@xcite of the polygons .",
    "this however would require post - processing of the barcode to filter out topological features in the interior of polygons .",
    "[ [ quality - of - the - barcodes ] ] quality of the barcodes + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the barcode obtained using the point sampling approach approximates the actual barcode of the input .",
    "the stability theorem  @xcite ensures that the two barcodes have a distance of at most  @xmath245 .",
    "still , the question arises how much noise is introduced by the approximation .",
    "we remind the reader about our motivation to produce barcodes of shape : we want to identify offset values that minimize the number of short - lived homological features .",
    "figure  [ fig : quality_of_barcode ] shows an exact barcode and an approximated barcode for the same input .",
    "we see that the exact barcode contains some short bars throughout the entire barcode .",
    "the approximated barcode contains many more such bars , some originating from real features in the input , and some are artifacts of the approximation .",
    "it seems ( at best ) very difficult to identify the real features from the approximate barcode , which speaks in favor of using the exact approach that we have taken in this paper in such types of applications .",
    "in this paper , we have defined cellular filtrations that yield the same barcode as the offset filtrations of convex polygons in @xmath13 , and convex polyhedra in @xmath14 .",
    "our filtrations generalize the alpha filtrations for point sets and have a size proportional to the size of the voronoi diagram of the involved sites .",
    "while the approach in @xmath13 simply consists of taking the nerve of the voronoi regions , we had to cut lower - dimensional cells in @xmath14 to obtain such a filtration .",
    "we restrict to the case of disjoint polyhedra for simplicity ; in the light of our intended application to 3d printing , an extension to interior - disjoint polyhedra is desirable .",
    "assuming disjointness , however , is not a serious restriction , as we can conceptually think of each polyhedron to be shrunk by an infinitesimal value , yielding a barcode that is arbitrarily close to the exact one .",
    "the details of this approach are left for an extended version of this paper .",
    "we suspect that our approach from section  [ sec : higher_dim ] generalizes to @xmath45 for @xmath248 and yields a filtration of same asymptotic complexity as the voronoi diagram ( for a constant dimension @xmath7 ) .",
    "the proof of this statement , however , requires several non - trivial extensions of our results , for instance , a generalization of pseudodisk property ( theorem  [ thm : pseudodisk_maintext ] ) in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we are in the process of implementing our refinement approach for the case of lines in @xmath14 , using the implementation of  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question in this context is whether for this special case , the voronoi diagram is already stratified .",
    "it is not even clear to us whether in this case , an analogue of theorem  [ thm:1-barcode_equivalence ] holds , that is , whether the the nerve of the voronoi regions yields an equivalent filtration .

    "* thm.13.8 )      ( partial ) extensions of the theorem have been given , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the case that @xmath131 is the unit ball . in this appendix",
    ", we will prove to the following generalization to the three - dimensional case  we are indebted to micha sharir who sketched the basic construction idea of the proof  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath114 , @xmath115 be two convex disjoint polyhedra in @xmath14 in general position and let @xmath108 be the unit ball .",
    "then , @xmath116 is either empty , a single point , or homeomorphic to a closed cycle .",
    "since @xmath114 and @xmath115 are convex and interior - disjoint , there is a plane @xmath441 that separates the interior of the two sets .",
    "we can assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that @xmath441 passes through the origin and that @xmath441 equals to @xmath442-plane after a suitable translation and rotation .",
    "we assume wlog that @xmath114 is above and @xmath115 is below @xmath441 .",
    "we fix the unit sphere @xmath443 .",
    "any point on @xmath443 defines a direction @xmath278 in @xmath14 .",
    "the direction @xmath278 defines an ordering of all planes that are normal to @xmath278 .",
    "we say the a plane @xmath444 is _ further than _ a plane @xmath445 if @xmath445 comes after @xmath444 when we go in direction @xmath278 .",
    "let @xmath446 be the furthest plane normal to @xmath278 that intersects @xmath114 . the same way , @xmath447 is the furthest plane for @xmath115 .",
    "we call @xmath114 _ more extreme _ than @xmath115 in direction @xmath278 if @xmath446 is further than @xmath447 .",
    "we call them _ equally extreme _ if @xmath446 and @xmath447 coincide . clearly , @xmath443 partitions into @xmath448 , the set of directions that are more extreme for @xmath114 , @xmath449 , the set of directions more extreme for @xmath115 , and @xmath450 , the directions which are equally extreme .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath448 and @xmath449 are non - empty , because in the upwards direction @xmath451 , @xmath114 is more extreme , and in the downwards direction @xmath452 , @xmath115 is more extreme .",
    "we show that @xmath450 is a closed cycle . for that , note that @xmath441 cuts out the equator from @xmath443 .",
    "letting @xmath278 denote a vector on the equator , let @xmath264 be the plane spanned by @xmath278 and @xmath451 .",
    "the projections @xmath453 , @xmath454 of @xmath114 , @xmath115 to @xmath264 are convex sets in the plane . fixing a direction @xmath263 in @xmath264",
    ", we can observe that @xmath263 is more extreme for @xmath114 than @xmath115 if and only if @xmath263 is more extreme for @xmath453 than for @xmath454 , and the same is true for equally extreme points .",
    "for the planar case , however , it is known that there are precisely @xmath1 equally extreme directions , cutting the unit circle into two parts , one of which gives all directions where @xmath114 is more extreme , and one where @xmath115 is more extreme . when varying @xmath278 , the equally extreme directions vary continuously , so the family of all such planes traces out a cycle of directions where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are equally extreme , cutting @xmath443 into two disks , one more extreme for @xmath114 and one more extreme for @xmath115 .",
    "now , consider the set @xmath455 .",
    "@xmath456 is either empty , a single point , or a @xmath4-dimensional convex shape .",
    "we assume that it is @xmath4-dimensional , since the statement follows easily otherwise .",
    "we consider the @xmath245-expansion @xmath457 of @xmath456 , where @xmath30 arbitrary .",
    "every point on @xmath458 originates from a unique point on @xmath459 ; we let @xmath460 denote the corresponding map . also , @xmath458 is differentiable",
    ". therefore , every point on the boundary has a unique tangent plane and an associated outward normal vector .",
    "vice versa , every direction appears as an outward normal vector exactly once because @xmath461 is convex .",
    "this implies the existence of a homeomorphism @xmath462 .",
    "in particular , the cycle @xmath450 maps to a cycle @xmath463 on @xmath458 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath464 , we call @xmath465 a _ supporting direction _ for @xmath40 if @xmath456 is completely contained in the half - space that contains @xmath466 and is bounded by the plane through @xmath40 that is normal to @xmath278",
    ". then , @xmath278 is a supporting direction for @xmath40 if and only if there exists a @xmath467 such that @xmath468 and @xmath278 is the outward normal vector of @xmath469 .",
    "set @xmath470 .",
    "remember that we want to show that @xmath471 is empty , a point , or a cycle .",
    "we argue that @xmath472 .",
    "let @xmath473 .",
    "therefore , by the basic properties of minkowski sums , there exists a supported direction @xmath134 by @xmath40 such that @xmath474 with @xmath475 the most extreme point in @xmath134 direction .",
    "since @xmath476 as well , it follows that @xmath114 is not more extreme than @xmath115 in direction @xmath134 . the same way , @xmath477 , with @xmath478 and @xmath135 also a supported direction by @xmath40 , and @xmath115 is not more extreme than @xmath114 in direction @xmath135 . now , there exist points @xmath479 with @xmath480 and the outward normal vectors of @xmath481 , @xmath482 are @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath114 is not more extreme than @xmath115 in direction @xmath134 , we have that @xmath483 . the same way , @xmath484 .",
    "if either of the points lies on @xmath31 , we are done .",
    "otherwise , since the preimage of @xmath40 under @xmath151 is connected , there is a path from @xmath481 to @xmath482 in the preimage , and this path has to cross @xmath31 .",
    "the intersection point then asserts that @xmath485 .",
    "the opposite directions follows by a similar argument .",
    "since @xmath151 is continuous , the previous argument shows that @xmath471 is closed curve on @xmath459 , but we have to exclude the case that @xmath471 is self - intersecting .",
    "assume for a contradiction the presence of a self - intersection at @xmath464 and consider a sufficiently small neighborhood around @xmath40 on @xmath459 .",
    "by assumption , there are at least @xmath486 arcs of @xmath471 leaving @xmath40 ; for simplicity , assume that there are precisely @xmath486 arcs ( the argument easily extends to the case of higher singularities ) .",
    "these arcs cut the neighborhood into @xmath486 sectors .",
    "each sector is a part of @xmath459 which either belongs to @xmath487 or to @xmath488 ( it can not belong to both , because then , the whole sector would belong to @xmath471 ) . by generic position",
    ", the sectors are alternating between @xmath487 and @xmath488 .",
    "now , since @xmath487 is differentiable and @xmath40 is part of it , there is a unique tangent plane @xmath489 at @xmath40 for @xmath487 .",
    "the same applies for the set @xmath488 , and we let @xmath490 denote the tangent plane with respect to this set . because of the alternating sector property , it follows that @xmath491 .",
    "let @xmath278 be the direction normal to @xmath489 .",
    "it follows that there exist points @xmath475 and @xmath478 such that @xmath492 .",
    "this implies that @xmath493 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are disjoint ."
