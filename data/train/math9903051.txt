    "let @xmath0 be a commutative , compact , connected , @xmath9-dimensional lie group , @xmath10 its lie algebra , @xmath1 a compact @xmath11-dimensional manifold and @xmath12 a faithful action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a _ gkm manifold _ if it has the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 is finite .",
    "2 .   @xmath1 possesses a @xmath0-invariant almost - complex structure .",
    "3 .   for every @xmath14 , the weights @xmath15 of the isotropy representation of @xmath0 on @xmath16 are pairwise linearly independent .    there is an alternate way of formulating this third condition : let @xmath1 be a @xmath0-manifold which satisfies the first two conditions , and define the _ one - skeleton _ of @xmath1 to be the set of points , @xmath2 with @xmath17 . then @xmath1 satisfies the third condition if and only if its one - skeleton consists of @xmath0-invariant submanifolds which are fixed point free and @xmath0-invariant embedded @xmath18-spheres , each of which contains exactly two fixed points .",
    "thus the combinatorial structure of this one - skeleton is that of a graph @xmath8 having the fixed points of @xmath0 as vertices and these @xmath18-spheres as edges . as we will see in the next section , @xmath8 is a regular graph : each vertex is the point of intersection of exactly @xmath19 edges .",
    "moreover , the action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 gives one a labeling of the oriented edges of @xmath8 by one - dimensional representations of @xmath0 .",
    "namely , to each oriented edge , @xmath20 , one can assign the isotropy representation , @xmath21 , of @xmath0 on the tangent space at the `` north pole '' of the corresponding @xmath22 , the `` north pole '' corresponding to the initial vertex of @xmath20 .",
    "thus one has a map @xmath23 from the set of oriented edges of @xmath8 to @xmath24 , which assigns to each oriented edge , @xmath20 , the weight , @xmath25 , of the representation @xmath21 .",
    "we will refer to the pair @xmath4 as the _ gkm one - skeleton _ associated to @xmath1 .",
    "a beautiful result of goresky - kottwitz - macpherson asserts that if @xmath1 is equivariantly formal , the equivariant cohomology ring , @xmath26 , can be reconstructed from the gkm one - skeleton .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath27 be the vertices of @xmath8 and @xmath28 the set of all maps , @xmath29 , which satisfy the compatibility condition @xmath30 for every pair of vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and every edge , @xmath20 , joining @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". then the gkm theorem asserts @xmath33 one interesting implication of this theorem is that one can prove , by topology , combinatorial results about @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , suppose that the action , @xmath34 , of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is hamiltonian .",
    "then , by a theorem of kirwan , @xmath1 is equivariantly formal ; so the gkm theorem applies to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , from the constant map , , @xmath35 , one gets a map , @xmath36 , and since @xmath37 , this map makes @xmath26 into an @xmath5-module . if @xmath34 is hamiltonian , kirwan proves that @xmath26 is a free @xmath5-module with @xmath38 generators in dimension @xmath7 , @xmath38 being the @xmath7-th betti number of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , using morse theory , one can compute these betti numbers directly from the gkm one - skeleton , @xmath4 , as follows : fix @xmath39 with @xmath40 for all @xmath41 and let @xmath6 be the number of vertices , @xmath31 , for which there are exactly @xmath42 oriented edges , @xmath20 , with _ initial _",
    "vertex @xmath31 , such that @xmath43 . then @xmath44 thus , by topology , one proves    [ th : n1 ] @xmath28 is a free @xmath5-module .",
    "moreover @xmath45 is a finite dimensional graded ring , its @xmath7-th graded component being of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "there are a number of other theorems about the structure of @xmath28 which can be proved `` by topology '' .",
    "for instance , using equivariant morse theory , one can write down a canonical set of generators of @xmath28 , and if @xmath34 is hamiltonian , one can , by methods of kirwan ( @xcite ) prove a number of interesting facts about subrings and quotient rings of @xmath28 .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite . )",
    "the question we want to explore in this paper is : _ can one prove these `` topological '' results about @xmath28 purely by combinatorial methods ? _ in other words , _ are these theorems combinatorial theorems about graphs in disguise ? _ two types of gkm manifolds for which this question has a positive answer are toric varieties and flag varieties . for toric varieties",
    "@xmath26 is the stanley - reisner ring of the moment polytope of @xmath1 , and for flag varieties , @xmath26 is the ring of `` double schubert polynomials '' ; and , in these cases , the theorems above follow from combinatorial theorems about poset cohomology , root systems , hecke algebras _ et al . _",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) therefore the question above is part of a more open - ended question : _ are there analogues of some of these combinatorial theorems for gkm manifolds in general ? _    the interplay between graphs and gkm manifolds may have some interesting applications in graph theory _ per se_.",
    "we will describe one example of such an application : let @xmath46 be a convex polytope in @xmath47 and let @xmath8 be its _ one - skeleton _ , _",
    "i.e. _ the graph consisting of the vertices and edges of @xmath46 .",
    "then , just as above , the oriented edges of @xmath8 have a natural labeling : to each oriented edge , @xmath20 , one can assign the edge vector , @xmath48 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the initial and the terminal vertices of @xmath20 . in analogy with the case of gkm manifolds , we will call the pair @xmath4 the _ gkm one - skeleton _ of @xmath46 .",
    "a problem of interest to combinatorists ( see , for instance , @xcite ) is how to deform @xmath46 so that the directions of its edges are unchanged . in particular , how many such deformations are there ?",
    "gkm theory suggests an answer : if @xmath46 is a simple polytope and its edge directions are rational , it is the moment polytope of a toric variety , @xmath1 ; and the number of ways in which one can deform @xmath46 without changing its edge directions is equal , by delzant s theorem ( @xcite ) , to the number of ways in which one can deform the symplectic structure of @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ is equal to @xmath49 , or , alternatively , by , is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : polytopes ] that this result is true not just for simple polytopes but for all convex polytopes which have the following `` edge - reflecting '' property : if two vertices , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , of @xmath8 are joined by an edge , @xmath20 , then for every edge , @xmath51 , containing @xmath31 , there exists a unique edge , @xmath52 , containing @xmath32 , such that , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are coplanar .",
    "( this is a joint result with ethan bolker . )",
    "this article consists of three chapters . in chapter one",
    "we review the theory of gkm manifolds and describe how to translate geometric properties of these manifolds into combinatorial properties of their associated gkm graphs . in chapter two",
    "we define an _",
    "abstract one - skeleton _ to be a labeled graph @xmath4 for which @xmath53 satisfies certain simple axioms ( axiomatizing properties of the gkm - skeleta discussed in chapter one . )",
    "we then define the _ cohomology ring _",
    ", @xmath28 , to be , as above , the set of all maps , @xmath29 which satisfy the compatibility conditions and prove that this ring is a free @xmath5-module with @xmath6 generators in dimension @xmath7 .",
    "( involved in the proof of this theorem are the graph - theoretical analogues of two basic theorems in equivariant symplectic geometry : the kirwan surjectivity theorem and the `` blow - up - blow - down '' theorem of brion - procesi - guillemin - sternberg - godinho .",
    "both these theorems have to do with the concept of symplectic reduction , and a large part of chapter two will be concerned with defining this concept in the context of abstract one - skeleta . )",
    "chapter three contains a number of applications .",
    "one of these is the theorem about edge - reflecting polytopes which we described above .",
    "another is a `` realization '' theorem for abstract gkm - skeleta .",
    "this asserts that an abstract one - skeleton @xmath4 is the gkm one - skeleton of a gkm manifold if and only is @xmath53 satisfies certain integrality conditions .",
    "this is a joint result with viktor ginzburg , yael karshon and sue tolman and is closely related to the realization theorem proved by them in @xcite .",
    "a third application has to do with the theory of schubert polynomials . in section [ ssec : schubs ]",
    "we show that , for the grassmannian , @xmath54 , the canonical generators of @xmath28 predicted by our theory have an alternative description in terms of the hecke algebra of divided difference operators and thus can be identified with the `` double schubert polynomials '' of @xcite .",
    "( together with tara holm we have generalized this to all partial flag varieties ; for details , see @xcite . )",
    "we would like to express our thanks to several of our colleagues for helping us to understand some of the key motivating examples in this subject : david vogan for furnishing us with an enlightening example of a gkm action of @xmath55 on @xmath56 , yael karshon , viktor ginzburg and sue tolman for furnishing us with an equally enlightening example of a gkm action of @xmath55 on the @xmath9-fold equivariant ramified cover of @xmath57 , mark goresky for pointing out to us the connection between the gkm theory of toric varieties and stanley - reisner theory , werner ballmann for making us aware of the fact that , for the grassmannian , gkm theory reduces to studying an object which graph theorists call the _ johnson graph _ , sara billey for helping us to understand the tie - in between our theory of thom classes for this graph and the standard schubert calculus , rebecca goldin and tara holm for helping us work out the details of this example ( in sections [ ssec : grass ] and [ ssec : schubs ] ) and ethan bolker for his beautiful observation ( see section [ ssec : combbetti ] , theorem [ th:2.5 ] ) that the betti numbers of a gkm one - skeleton are well - defined , independent of the choice of an admissible orientation .",

    "for each of the weights @xmath58 on the list ( [ eq:1.0 ] ) let @xmath59 be the identity component of the kernel of the map @xmath60 and let @xmath61 be the connected component of @xmath62 containing @xmath31 .",

    "consider the decomposition @xmath64 of @xmath16 into 2-dimensional weight spaces .",
    "our assumption that the weights ( [ eq:1.0 ] ) are pairwise linear independent imply that @xmath65 and hence that @xmath61 is two - dimensional .",
    "since the only oriented two - manifold with faithful @xmath66 actions are @xmath22 and @xmath55 , @xmath61 has to be one of them .",
    "however , the action of @xmath66 on @xmath55 is fixed point free , so @xmath61 is diffeomorphic to @xmath22 . finally , the fact that the action of @xmath66 is the standard @xmath66 action is standard .",
    "thus @xmath31 is the point of intersection of @xmath19 embedded @xmath0-invariant 2-spheres .",
