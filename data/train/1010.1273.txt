    "in the field of quantum foundations , the mathematician ernst specker is rightly famous for introducing , with co - author simon kochen , the concept of a _ noncontextual hidden variable model _ and proving that such a model can not underly quantum theory .",
    "this 1967 result , known as the kochen - specker theorem @xcite , continues to be an active subject of research today ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a bibliography ) .",
    "one finds precursors to this result in the 1957 work of gleason @xcite and bell s 1966 review article on hidden variable models ( which refers to gleason s result ) @xcite , but also in a 1960 paper by specker entitled `` the logic of propositions that are not simultaneously decidable '' @xcite .",
    "this article studied logical features of quantum theory , in particular the question of the consistency of counterfactual propositions concerning the values of observables that are not comeasurable .",
    "one of the points of the paper was to show that it is possible to conceive of an implication relation that is not transitive .",
    "the idea is illustrated with a parable wherein an over - protective seer sets a simple prediction task to his daughter s suitors .",
    "the challenge can not be met because the seer asks the suitors for a noncontextual assignment of values but measures a system for which the statistics are inconsistent with such an assignment .",
    "the present article considers the parable anew and seeks to connect it with modern developments in quantum foundations .",
    "in particular , we explore the extent to which the sorts of correlations instantiated in the seer s prediction game can be achieved in a quantum world .",
    "although the precise correlations that are required by the seer do not occur in quantum theory , the prediction game is found to be a good pump for quantum intuitions .",
    "it leads quite naturally to proofs of nonlocality and contextuality , to a novel kind of complementarity and to the notion of stronger - than - quantum correlations .",
    "indeed , it provides a narrative thread that is able to weave together a great number of important modern results . that so much can be gleaned from this little prediction game",
    "is a testament to the depth of specker s work .",
    "we offer this article as a small tribute to him on the occasion of his 90th birthday .",
    "we begin by reproducing specker s parable of the overprotective seer , with clarifications by us in square brackets :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ at the assyrian school of prophets in arbailu in the time of king asarhaddon [ ( 681 - 669 bce ) ] , there taught a seer from nineva .",
    "he was a distinguished representative of his faculty ( eclipses of the sun and moon ) and aside from the heavenly bodies , his interest was almost exclusively in his daughter .",
    "his teaching success was limited ; the subject proved to be dry and required a previous knowledge of mathematics which was scarcely available . if he did not find the student interest which he desired in class , he did find it elsewhere in overwhelming measure .",
    "his daughter had hardly reached a marriageable age when he was flooded with requests for her hand from students and young graduates . and",
    "though he did not believe that he would always have her by his side , she was in any case still too young and her suitors in no way worthy . in order that the suitors might convince themselves of their unworthiness",
    ", he promised them that she would be we d to the one who could solve a prediction task that was posed to them .",
    "each suitor was taken before a table on which three little boxes stood in a row , [ each of which might or might not contain a gem ] , and was asked to predict which of the boxes contained a gem and which did not .",
    "but no matter how many times they tried , it seemed impossible to succeed in this task .",
    "after each suitor had made his prediction , he was ordered by the father to open any two boxes which he had predicted to be both empty or any two boxes which he had predicted to be both full [ in accordance with whether he had predicted there to be at most one gem among the three boxes , or at least two gems , respectively ] .",
    "but it always turned out that one contained a gem and the other one did not , and furthermore the stone was sometimes in the first and sometimes in the second of the boxes that were opened . but how can it be possible , given three boxes , to neither be able to pick out two as empty nor two as full ?    the daughter would have remained unmarried until the father s death , if not for the fact that , after the prediction of the son of a prophet [ whom she fancied ] , she quickly opened two boxes herself , one of which had been indicated to be full and the other empty , and the suitor s prediction [ for these two boxes ] was found , in this case , to be correct . following the weak protest of her father that he had wanted two other boxes opened , she tried to open the third .",
    "but this proved impossible whereupon the father grudgingly admitted that the prediction , being unfalsified , was valid .",

    "such correlations are contextual in the sense",
    "that if one wishes to explain the measurements ( opening a box ) as revealing a pre - existing property , then one must imagine that the outcome of a measurement ( or equivalently , the property that is measured ) is context - dependent - whether a gem is seen or not in the first box depends on whether that box was opened together with the second or together with the third .",
    "the seer s challenge can not be met by the suitors because he asks them for a noncontextual assignment of outcomes ( i.e. a specification of whether a gem will be found or not in each box , independent of which other box is opened with it ) but measures a system for which the statistics are inconsistent with such an assignment.n order that the suitors might convince themselves of their unworthiness '' . ]",
    "to imagine a world wherein the parable might occur , specker must effectively posit the existence of a system that exhibits a particular kind of complementarity : the system must be such that three distinct measurements can implemented upon it , any pair of which can be measured jointly , but where a joint measurement of all three is not possible . to see this , one need only note that if all three binary - outcome measurements _ could _ be implemented jointly , some pair would necessarily be found to have correlated outcomes .",
    "we now ask the obvious question : can the parable be implemented in quantum theory ?",
    "the reader is urged to pause and give this question some thought before reading on .",
    "there is of course a trivial sense in which the parable can be implemented in a quantum world , namely the same way that it can be implemented in a classical world : through a hidden mechanism under the seer s table and under his control , which inserts and removes gems from the closed boxes at his will .",
    "such a mechanism would allow the seer to enforce complementarity and contextuality `` by hand '' , so to speak .",
    "however this is clearly not what specker had in mind , because had that been the case , the seer would not have been so easily stymied by his daughter s trick , as there would have been no reason why the third box could not have been opened .",
    "rather , the seer seems to be in possession of a set of `` magic '' boxes that have particular , rather than arbitrary , correlations .",
    "thus in asking the question whether the parable can be implemented in quantum theory , we mean : does quantum theory allow for this sort of `` magic '' , which would be truly surprising for a naive suitor familiar only with classical theories , which do not incorporate contextuality and complementarity at a fundamental level ?",
    "certainly , both complementarity and contextuality are required at a fundamental level in quantum theory ",
    "measurements that can not be implemented jointly , and correlations that can not be explained by noncontextual pre - existing properties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "but what about the particular correlations of the specker parable ? to get this kind of contextuality ,",
    "it is necessary to find a situation wherein there are very specific sorts of limitations on joint measurability  there must exist a triple of measurements that can only be implemented jointly in pairs . for projective measurements in quantum theory ,",
    "this sort of limitation on joint measurability does _ not _ occur .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "two hermitian operators can be jointly measured if and only they are jointly diagonalizable .",
    "but if we have three hermitian operators @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and each pair of operators is jointly diagonalizable , then all three are jointly diagonalizable .",
    "this is true for any number of hermitian operators  one can implement all jointly if and only if one can implement every pair jointly .",
    "nonetheless , one can imagine modifying the parable in various different ways to obtain something for which an analogue _ can _ be found in quantum theory , and these different modifications are the topics of the different sections of our article . in the following we outline each of them in turn .",
    "we begin by providing , in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , a formalization of the original parable as well as some refinements and elaborations thereof , together with definitions of the key concepts .",
    "we then present the four different themes inspired by the parable , with an interlude on frustrated networks .    * a double - query @xmath3-box system allowing only adjacent queries ( sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumcontextuality ] ) .",
    "* the seer could have a set of @xmath3 boxes , arranged in a ring , for which only _ adjacent _ pairs of boxes can be opened jointly .",
    "for @xmath3 odd , classical intuition leads one to expect that there must exist at least one adjacent pair of boxes that are either both full or both empty , but we can imagine that the seer has a special system wherein , regardless of which adjacent pair of boxes is opened , it is always the case that one is found full and the other empty .",
    "the @xmath4 case , which corresponds to the original parable , is exceptional because the adjacent pairs constitute all the pairs . for @xmath5",
    "this is not the case , and so there is no longer any obstacle to finding a set of projective measurements that have the same pattern of joint measurability as these boxes .",
    "indeed , one can find such sets .",
    "there are then two ways of trying to obtain a quantum analogue of the new parable .",
    "i ) _ _  klyachko s proof of contextuality . _",
    "_ * *  * * find a quantum state that yields a nonzero probability of anti - correlation for every adjacent pair .",
    "when the overall probability is higher than one could account for classically , we arrive at a klyachko - type proof of quantum contextuality  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) _ _ a new variant of klyachko s proof of contextuality . _",
    "_ * *  * * find a quantum state that supports the implication from one outcome to the opposite outcome for every adjacent pair in the ring and that assigns a non - zero probability to the first outcome in the sequence of inferences . in conjunction with the transitivity of implication ( a consequence of noncontextuality ) , and the fact that the ring contains an odd number of boxes , this gives rise to a contradiction , thereby demonstrating the contextuality of quantum theory .    * a separated pair of single - query 3-box systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec : separated ] ) .",
    "* one can imagine that the seer s three - box system is such that only a single box ( rather than a pair of boxes ) can be opened at any given time , but that it is possible to prepare a pair of three - box systems such that by opening a single box on each element of the pair , one reproduces the seer s correlations . specifically ,",
    "if the _ same _ box is opened on each member of the pair , they are always found to be both full or both empty , while if _ different _ boxes are opened on the two systems , one is always found full and the other empty .",
    "( classically , one would expect that some pair of boxes on a given wing are both full or both empty , and by the assumed perfect correlation between the wings , the same pair is similarly configured on the other wing , implying that it is impossible to open different boxes on the two systems and always find anti - correlation rather than correlation . ) here , we are postulating six distinct measurements ( three on each wing ) only certain pairs of which can be implemented jointly , namely , pairs that have one member from each wing .",
    "so again , there is no obstacle to finding a set of projectors having this pattern of joint measurability .",
    "there are once again two ways of trying to obtain a quantum analogue of the new parable .",
    "\\i ) _ mermin s proof of bell - nonlocality . _",
    "find a quantum state that yields perfect correlation when the same measurement is implemented on the two wings .",
    "demonstrate that the extent to which it can yield anti - correlation when different boxes are opened is greater than is possible in a bell - local model  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) _ hardy s proof of bell - nonlocality . _",
    "find a chain of choices of measurement , alternating between the two parties , and find a quantum state that yields implications connecting particular outcomes of all but one measurement within this chain .",
    "demonstrate that there is a nonzero probability for the kind of correlation exhibited by the last pair in the chain to be opposite to what one would expect by the transitivity of implication  @xcite .",
    "we also consider generalizations of these nonlocality proofs to rings of @xmath3 measurements where only adjacent members can be implemented jointly .",
    "* interlude on frustrated networks ( sec .",
    "[ sec : frustratednetworks ] ) .",
    "* by representing correlations between binary - valued observables by frustrated networks , we provide a simple categorization of some of the contextual and bell - nonlocal correlations outlined above .    * a diachronic pair of single - queries of a 3-box system ( sec .  [ quantumprepcontextuality ] ) . * in this case ,",
    "the seer s three - box system is modified so that only a single box can be opened at any given time , but that it is possible to implement two _ consecutive _ measurements in such a way that if the same box is opened at the two times , then the result of the measurement is always reproduced faithfully , while if different boxes are opened at the two times , then the results are always different . in addition , we impose the constraint that no measurement at the second time can yield any information about the choice of the measurement at the first time .",
    "now it is natural for a suitor to assume that statistical indistinguishability among a set of choices implies that they are equivalent at the level of an ontological model .",
    "this assumption is known as preparation noncontextuality @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that no such preparation - noncontextual model can reproduce the diachronic ( two - time ) correlations stated above .",
    "but in quantum mechanics ( which violates preparation noncontextuality @xcite ) , there are sets of measurements for which these correlations can be approximated even though the quantum state after the first measurement reveals no information about the identity of this measurement .    * joint measurability of povms ( sec .",
    "[ sec : jmpovm ] ) .",
    "* a final path to a quantum analogue of the overprotective seer ( os ) parable is to ignore the counter - intuitive correlations , and rather concentrate on the complementarity exhibited by the three boxes .",
    "as discussed above , the pairwise but not triplewise joint measurability of three observables can not exist in quantum mechanics for traditional ( projective ) measurements .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility that there exists a triple of generalized measurements , described by povms ( positive operator valued measures ) , that can be jointly measured pairwise but not triplewise .",
    "indeed , we will exhibit two specific examples of such a triple of nonprojective measurements .",
    "this thread connects with some recent results on joint measurability of povms  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that this example is not useful for approximating the os correlations , nor for proving the contextuality of quantum theory .",
    "we wish to flesh out the original parable by being more specific about the nature of the correlations posited therein .",
    "we shall do this within the context of operational theories .",
    "this is natural because the os parable was originally presented by specker as a `` toy theory '' with similarities to quantum theory , not as a scenario that arises within quantum theory .",
    "we thus need a unified framework to compare the os theory both with quantum theory , and with classical theories ( i.e. theories without contextuality or complementarity ) . also , to make the most of the os parable we need to embellish the narrative ( in a formal way ) by adding extra assumptions , and this requires considering measurements and preparations beyond those discussed by specker .",
    "finally , we note that in the fields of quantum foundations and quantum information , there is currently considerable interest in operational `` foil '' theories such as popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) boxes @xcite and the toy - bit theory @xcite .",
    "an operational theory is one that specifies the probabilities of each possible outcome @xmath6 of each possible measurement procedure @xmath7 given each possible preparation procedure @xmath8 .",
    "we denote these probabilities by @xmath9 it will be important for the later discussion of contextuality to distinguish between a measurement procedure @xmath7 , which is a specification of a list of instructions of what to do in the laboratory , and an equivalence class @xmath10 of measurement procedures , where two procedures are equivalent if they yield the same statistics for all preparation procedures . for instance , the equivalence class associated with a particular measurement procedure @xmath11 is@xmath12 we will refer to this equivalence relation over procedures as _ operational equivalence . _ we will refer to the equivalence classes as simply _ measurements _ , and denote them by calligraphic font , while the measurement procedures  will be denoted by italic font .",
    "similarly , we define equivalence classes of preparation procedures . for instance",
    ", the equivalence class associated with a particular preparation procedure @xmath13 is@xmath14 given that probabilities of outcomes of measurements depend only on the equivalence classes of the preparation and the measurement procedures , we typically condition only on the latter and write @xmath15 .",
    "we begin by providing an operational definition of joint measurability .",
    "we consider only measurements with a discrete set of outcomes .",
    "joint measurability of a set of @xmath16 measurements can be defined ( recursively ) as follows .",
    "[ dfn : jointmeasurability ] a set of @xmath16 measurements @xmath17 is jointly measurable if there exists a measurement @xmath10 with the following features : ( i ) the outcome set of @xmath10 is the cartesian product of the outcome sets of @xmath18 and ( ii ) the outcome distributions for every joint measurement of a subset @xmath19 are recovered as marginals of the outcome distribution of @xmath10 for all preparations @xmath20 . denoting a joint measurement of the subset @xmath21 by @xmath22 , and its outcome by @xmath23 , @xmath24",
    "the condition can be expressed as @xmath25    a set of measurements @xmath26 is @xmath3-tuple - wise jointly measurable if every @xmath3-element subset ( i.e. every @xmath3-tuple of measurements ) is jointly measurable .",
    "clearly joint measurability of all @xmath3-tuples implies joint measurability of all @xmath27-tuples , but not vice - versa .",
    "finally , we shall sometimes say that the measurements in a set @xmath17 exhibit _ complementary _ if they are not jointly measurable .",
    "we can now be precise about the nature of the correlations in the overprotective seer s prediction game .",
    "abstracting from the story of boxes and gems , the parable posits that there are three distinct measurement procedures , which we shall denote by @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( corresponding to the choice of box ) .",
    "a key assumption that is not explicit in specker s description of the prediction game is that these three measurement procedures are not operationally equivalent .",
    "that is , for every pair , there is a preparation procedure that distinguishes them , that is , some @xmath8 such that @xmath31 . making this assumption",
    ", we see that the game assumes the existence of three distinct equivalence classes of measurement procedures , which we denote by @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that these are pairwise jointly measurable .",
    "it follows that there exist three joint measurements , which we shall denote by @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 and which , by virtue of the definition of joint measurability , must have statistics that reproduce the statistics of @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 as marginals .",
    "note that , as the notation suggests , @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to distinct equivalence classes of measurement procedures , a fact that follows from the operational distinguishability of @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    note also that within the equivalence class of measurement procedures @xmath38 , there are procedures @xmath39 that involve implementing a joint measurement of @xmath38 and @xmath33 and discarding the outcome of the @xmath33 measurement , and there are procedures @xmath40 that involve implementing a joint measurement of @xmath38 and @xmath34 and discarding the outcome of the @xmath34 measurement",
    ". which of these two procedures is implemented may be relevant in a contextual hidden variable model , as we will see .",
    "the seer s trick also requires that there is at least one preparation , call it @xmath41 that yields perfect negative correlations for the joint measurement of any pair of @xmath38 , @xmath33 and @xmath42 perfect negative correlation for a single joint measurement of @xmath38 and @xmath33 does not imply that one must have equal probability for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( the two ways of achieving perfect negative correlation ) .",
    "however , this equality does follow from demanding perfect negative correlation for _ all three _ joint measurements , as we show in appendix [ app : speckercorrelations ] .",
    "consequently , the correlations are of the form @xmath47 we call these the _ overprotective seer correlations _ , or _ os correlations . _ note that it follows from this definition that individual measurements have a uniformly random outcome , @xmath48      the question of joint measurability concerns what is physically possible , not what is logically possible .",
    "if a physical theory postulates measurements that can not be jointly implemented , it could still be that there is a joint probability distribution over the outcomes of these measurements that yields each measurement s statistics as a marginal .",
    "consider a set of measurements @xmath49 let @xmath21 be a subset of their indices and denote the joint measurement associated with this subset by @xmath22 and its outcome by @xmath23 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : subsetofmmts ] ) . a joint distribution for the measurements @xmath26 is said to exist if there exists a distribution @xmath50 for every preparation @xmath20 such that for any measurement @xmath51 @xmath52    it is worth noting that within a given theory , the nonexistence of a joint distribution for some set of measurements implies the physical impossibility of a joint measurement of these .",
    "this follows from the fact that if a joint measurement is possible , then there must exist a joint distribution over the outcomes .",
    "however , the converse implication need not hold .",
    "for instance , there are theories , such as the toy theory of ref .",
    "@xcite which postulate the physical impossibility of certain joint measurements , but for which a joint distribution over outcomes ( effectively a hidden variable model ) does exist .",
    "the feature of the os correlations that is at the root of their peculiarities is the fact that they do not admit of a joint distribution .",
    "[ lemma : nojmforos ] there is no distribution @xmath53 on the three binary variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 such that the marginals over pairs of these are of the form of eq .",

    "we also assume that the seer can prepare a pair of single - query systems that mimic the behavior of the double - query system as follows : if the same  box is opened on one system as is opened on the other , one obtains the same result ( both are always found to be full , or both empty ) ; if different boxes are opened , then one obtains different results ( one is always full and the other empty ) . for the benefit of skeptical suitors",
    ", the seer allows for the queries of the two different systems to be implemented at space - like separation .",
    "we imagine that they are transported to different corners of the assyrian empire : one to abydos and the other to babylon .",
    "the suitor dispatches two of his trusted classmates , one to each of these two cities , and instructs them to choose a box at random .",
    "we are therefore imagining a situation wherein two observables are measured jointly by first preparing a pair of systems in a perfectly correlated state and measuring one observable on each .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , this version of the specker parable allows us to establish a simple proof of nonlocality in the same spirit as that presented by mermin in ref .",
    "let us denote the choices made by the two class - mates by @xmath110 and @xmath246 respectively , taking values in the set @xmath247 , corresponding to the choice of box .",
    "further , we denote the results of box @xmath110 at abydos and box @xmath246 at babylon , respectively , by @xmath248 and @xmath249 , taking values in @xmath250 corresponding to the observations @xmath251full , empty@xmath252 .",
    "then we can express the condition that the outcomes must satisfy in this two - wing version of the specker parable as @xmath253where @xmath254 denotes the kronecker delta function . to quantify the extent to which these correlations are realized ,",
    "let us define @xmath255 as the weighted sum , assuming @xmath110 and @xmath246 are chosen uniformly at random , of the probability of achieving perfect negative correlation when @xmath256 , and the probability of achieving perfect correlation when @xmath257 .",
    "that is , @xmath258 where @xmath259 refers to the probability of finding @xmath260 conditioned on box @xmath110 being opened at abydos and box @xmath246 being opened at babylon ; likewise for @xmath261 .",
    "the os correlations described in the two - wing specker parable can be summarized as @xmath262 the assumption that @xmath263 and @xmath264 are jointly measurable in the sense of definition  ( [ dfn : jointmeasurability ] ) implies that they must satisfy a condition of no superluminal signaling  @xcite , namely , @xmath265 which asserts that the conditional marginal probabilities @xmath266 obtained by summing over @xmath249 are independent of the choice of the distant measurement procedure @xmath264 , and likewise for @xmath267 .",
    "it is simple to show , as we do in appendix [ app : correlations : os2 ] , that by imposing the no - signaling condition , the correlations are constrained to be of the following form : @xmath268 we will henceforth call these the nonlocal os correlations .",
    "the winning probability for eq .  ( [ eq : winprobost ] ) is unity for these correlations , i.e. , @xmath269 they are the only non - signaling correlations that can win this prediction game deterministically .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the nonlocal os correlations represent an _ extreme point _ of the convex set of non - signaling correlations  @xcite , very much like the archetypical pr box correlations  @xcite for the scenario where @xmath270 only run from 1 to 2 .",
    "although these correlations do not allow for superluminal signaling , they do violate bell s assumption of local causality @xcite , as we now demonstrate .    in order to enforce perfect positive correlations when the suitor s two classmates make the same measurement , the babylonian system must be prepared with an answer for each possible query that matches the answer that the abydosian system is prepared to provide .",
    "it follows that there are deterministic noncontextual hidden variables determining the outcome on the babylonian system .",
    "this step is familiar from bell s original derivation of his theorem  @xcite : locality together with the assumption of perfect correlations implies the existence of deterministic noncontextual values for each system .",
    "given such values , it is easy to see then we have positive correlation for @xmath271 and negative correlation for @xmath272 , in accordance with the nonlocal os correlations .",
    "however , we also have positive correlation for @xmath273 in disagreement with the nonlocal os correlations .",
    "thus the correlations are correct in only 7 out of 9 cases .",
    "alternative strategies that do not enforce the perfect correlation when @xmath257 can not do any better .",
    "for instance , if all boxes on the left are empty and all boxes on the right are full , then one has 6 out of 6 anti - correlations but 0 out of 3 correlations , leaving a winning probability of 2/3 , which is smaller than 7/9 . ]",
    "that the overall probability of winning the game in a locally causal model is at most @xmath274 .",
    "that is , @xmath275this is a bell inequality .",
    "the fact that @xmath276 for the seer s system is a violation of this bell inequality and a proof that no locally causal model of the nonlocal os correlations is possible .    the bell inequality   can also be written in terms of the more conventional correlation function , or the so - called two - party correlator @xmath277 , where @xmath278 , @xmath279 take on values @xmath280 as usual : @xmath281 the two - party correlator is simply the average value of the product of the result in abydos when box @xmath110 was chosen , multiplied by the result in babylon when box @xmath246 was chosen .",
    "together with the normalization condition @xmath282 , we can now re - express the winning probability as @xmath283 , where @xmath284 in these notations , it is again easy to verify that if the variables @xmath278 , @xmath279 admit pre - existing values @xmath285 (",
    "i.e. are determined by hidden variables ) , then @xmath286 [ _ cf . _ eq .  ] .",
    "( as is now well - known  @xcite , the same bound also applies to any locally causal model where the values of the variables are determined by stochastic hidden variable models . )",
    "specker s correlations require @xmath287 , thus clearly violating the bell - inequality .      what about correlations allowed in quantum theory ? we know from a celebrated theorem by cleve _",
    "et  al . _ ( theorem 5.12 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that there is no quantum strategy that can give unit winning probability .",
    "while it is not possible to realize the over - protective seer parable as formulated above , it is nevertheless possible to demonstrate , using quantum mechanics , correlations that approximate the desired correlations better than any locally causal model can .",
    "as it turns out , the largest winning probability allowed by quantum theory is ( see appendix  [ app : maxqv : bell : n ] for details ) @xmath288and hence @xmath289 ( which exceed the bell - local bounds of @xmath290 and @xmath291 respectively ) .",
    "that quantum theory allows such non - trivial correlations can be verified by considering the two - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath292 ( in the @xmath293 basis ) and letting @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 be the results of measuring the three pauli operators equally spaced in the @xmath297-@xmath298 plane , defined by @xmath299 likewise for the @xmath300 , which are defined identically .",
    "thus quantum mechanics allows us to move towards the extremal non - local correlations in our formulation of the parable .",
    "this proof that quantum theory violates bell - locality ( bell s theorem ) is in fact the one popularized by david mermin @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this new parable to the case of @xmath3 boxes for all odd @xmath108 .",
    "specifically , posit a separated pair of @xmath3-box rings such that if the box that is opened in abydos is the same as the one opened in babylon , the outcomes agree , while if the index @xmath110 of the box opened in abydos differs by 1 from the index @xmath246 of the one opened in babylon , that is , if @xmath301 or @xmath302 , then the outcomes disagree . as it turns out , the correlations must be of the form for the specific case of @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath303 we do not specify the nature of the correlation for other values of @xmath110 and @xmath246 .",
    "we can define the average probability of success as @xmath304 it is evident that with a local strategy if one has perfect correlation when @xmath257 , then when @xmath302 or @xmath305 , one can have perfect anti - correlation with probability at most @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , no local strategy can do any better than this .",
    "consequently , given that the conditions @xmath257 , @xmath302 , and @xmath305 arise with probability @xmath306 each , the winning probability with a local strategy is upper bounded by   @xmath307    quantum theory can violate this inequality .",

    "it is clear that by replacing the first and last beads by a single bead , we have precisely the correlations considered above .",

    "the case of two correlations and one anti - correlation corresponds , in the imagery of specker s parable , to a case where if boxes 1 and 2 or boxes 1 and 3 are opened , one finds the same outcome , but if boxes 2 and 3 are opened , the outcomes always differ . note , however , that these different networks are equivalent up to a relabeling of the outcomes and consequently represent essentially the same correlations .     all the ways in which a triangular network can be frustrated.,width=279 ]    indeed",
    ", all the frustrated networks with a given number of nodes can be obtained one from another by a relabeling of the outcomes .",
    "it therefore suffices to consider a single representative of the equivalence class of frustrated networks with a given number of nodes .",
    "it is also possible to have a similar graphical representation for some of the no - go theorems for noncontextuality and locality that are based on a failure of transitivity of implication .",
    "we represent a set of implications among the values of binary - outcome observables by a _ directed _ graph with decorated edges .",
    "the implications of interest are of the form : @xmath437 where @xmath438 and either @xmath439 or @xmath440 .",
    "we depict this by inserting a directed edge ( i.e. an arrow ) from the node for @xmath210 to the node for @xmath441 and decorating the base of the arrow with the value @xmath442 ; the directed edge is solid if @xmath439 and dashed if @xmath440 .",
    "note that this implication can also be written in its contrapositive form as @xmath443 .",
    "therefore , we can always represent the same implication with an arrow in the opposite direction .",
    "when reversing an arrow , the value decorating the arrow stays the same if the arrow is solid and flips if the arrow is dashed .",
    "if the parity is odd around a closed loop in such a directed graph , then the antecedent of the first implication is denied by the consequent of the last implication .",
    "therefore , as long as the antecedent has non - zero probability , we have a failure of the transitivity of implication .",
    "such a directed network is said to be frustrated .    in the introduction , we described how specker s parable implies a failure of the transitivity of implication ( under the assumption that value - assignments to observables are context - independent ) . letting @xmath444 denote the proposition that @xmath445 ( box @xmath93 contains a gem ) , the set of implications are : @xmath182 , @xmath185 , and @xmath446 .",

    "the only sense in which one could imagine a theory being `` more contextual '' , according to this sort of proof , is by assigning a higher probability to the contradiction - generating valuation of the first observable in the chain .",
    "an _ extremal _",
    "version of such a proof would be one wherein both possible valuations of the first observable yielded a contradiction .",

    "[ sec : hardy ] , it is not possible to find a quantum state and a set of observables that instantiates such a set of implications while assigning a nonzero probability to the contradiction - generating valuation of the first observable .",
    "so far , in all of our quantum analogues of specker s parable , the correlations examined were between the outcomes of pairs of measurements that could be implemented _",
    "jointly_. in this section , we consider the possibility of achieving these correlations between the outcomes of pairs of measurements that are implemented _ _",
    "consecutively__.    it is important to recognize that one need not rule out the possibility of consecutive measurements to ensure the impossibility of joint measurements .",
    "the original version of the specker parable is misleading in this respect .",
    "it asks us to imagine that after opening two boxes , one is simply unable to open the third ( as if its lid were glued shut with an unbreakable seal ) .",
    "the literal generalization to arbitrary measurements @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 that can be measured jointly pairwise but not triplewise would seem to be that if @xmath38 and @xmath33 have been implemented , a mysterious force prevents us from carrying out the instructions that correspond to implementing @xmath42 however , this conclusion does not follow from a denial of joint measurability as it is defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : jm ] .",
    "one can always implement @xmath34 following a measurement of @xmath38 and @xmath33 on a preparation @xmath447 it is just that the statistics of outcomes of @xmath34 that one thereby obtains is not the same as one would have obtained if @xmath34 were implemented on @xmath20 directly . to be precise , if the joint statistics of outcomes of a pair of measurements @xmath10 and @xmath448 are independent of the order in which they are implemented , then the consecutive implementation of the two measurements constitutes a joint measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath448 by the definition of sec .  [ sec : jm ] .",
    "consequently , a denial of joint measurability implies a denial of the invariance of statistics under a reordering of the measurements .",
    "this way of interpreting a lack of joint measurability is precisely the one that is familiar from the quantum theory of projective measurements .    to see how the os correlations might obtain for consecutive measurements , we present a new parable .",
    "we consider a single - query 3-box system , that is , one where only a single box can be opened at a time .",
    "a pair of boxes can be opened consecutively , but the second box - opening need not reproduce the statistics of outcomes that would have been observed had it been opened first . in this sense , the measurements associated with opening distinct boxes can not be implemented jointly .",
    "we now get to the specifics of the correlations , which are inspired by the original specker parable .",
    "we assume that there is a special preparation @xmath449 of the 3-box system , such that if the _ same _ box is opened at the two times , then the same outcome is found , while if _ different _ boxes are opened at the two times , then different outcomes are found .",
    "so far , there is nothing in this set of correlations that prohibits their being explained by a generalized - noncontextual ontological model .",
    "because no two measurements are ever implemented jointly in this parable , there is no sense in which any measurement has a nontrivial context upon which its ontological representation might depend . indeed , there are ontological models that explain the correlations easily .",
    "they need only posit that the first measurement disturbs the ontic state of the three - box system in order to enforce the appropriate correlations .",
    "for instance , suppose that three bits specify the gem occupation numbers of the three boxes and completely characterize the ontic state .",
    "it could be that finding a @xmath450 ( @xmath451 for a box forces the other two boxes to have occupation number @xmath452 .",
    "( indeed , if the suitor is opening boxes on a table , this kind of disturbance to the ontic state might be enforced by having a hidden mechanism under the table that automatically inserts or removes gems from the two boxes that were not opened . )    to obtain a set of correlations that can challenge the assumption of generalized - noncontextuality , we need to modify the thought experiment slightly by adding the following assumption :  in addition to the correlations described , it is the case that after the early measurement is complete , for every possible subsequent measurement ( the theory may well allow more than the three measurements that are used in the protocol ) , it is impossible to obtain any information about the identity of the early measurement .",
    "we call this the _ trit - obliviousness _ condition ( this terminology has its precedent in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "note that implementing the early measurement procedure and selecting a particular outcome constitutes a preparation . for each of the three possible measurement procedures , @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath453 and each of the outcomes @xmath450 and @xmath183",
    ", we obtain a distinct preparation procedure .",
    "we denote these by @xmath454 @xmath455 @xmath456 @xmath457 @xmath458 and @xmath459 in an obvious notation . and",
    "@xmath460 that are in the same operational equivalence class @xmath38 , may nonetheless define preparation procedures that fail to be operationally equivalent , because operational equivalence for preparation procedures is decided by the statistics of all possible subsequent measurements .",
    "] we can also define the preparations that result when one chooses not to condition on the outcome of the measurement procedure .",
    "we denote these by @xmath461 and @xmath462 .",
    "finally , we denote the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath450 when the first measurement @xmath463 is implemented on the special preparation @xmath449 by @xmath464 and we define @xmath465 the statistics for the unconditional preparations are then given by@xmath466the trit - obliviousness condition states that preparation procedures @xmath467 and @xmath462 are operationally equivalent , that is , @xmath468we now see how the new parable might have troubles with generalized - noncontextuality . in sec .",

    "<S> in 1960 , the mathematician ernst specker described a simple example of nonclassical correlations , the counterintuitive features of which he dramatized using a parable about a seer who sets an impossible prediction task to his daughter s suitors . </S>",

    "<S> several novel results are presented , including : a generalization of a theorem by fine connecting the existence of a joint distribution over outcomes of counterfactual measurements to the existence of a measurement - noncontextual and outcome - deterministic ontological model ; a generalization of klyachko s proof of the kochen - specker theorem from pentagrams to a family of star polygons ; a proof of the kochen - specker theorem in the style of hardy s proof of bell s theorem ( i.e. , one that makes use of the failure of the transitivity of implication for counterfactual statements ) ; a categorization of contextual and bell - nonlocal correlations in terms of frustrated networks ; a derivation of a new inequality testing preparation noncontextuality ; and lastly , some novel results on the joint measurability of povms and the question of whether these can be modeled noncontextually . finally , we emphasize that specker s parable of the over - protective seer provides a novel type of foil to quantum theory , challenging us to explain why the particular sort of contextuality and complementarity embodied therein does not arise in a quantum world . </S>"
