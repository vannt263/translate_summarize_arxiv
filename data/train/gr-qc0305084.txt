    "the effects of rotation on space - time have always been sources of stimulating and fascinating physical issues for the last centuries . indeed , even before the introduction of the concept of space - time continuum , the peculiarity of the rotation of the reference frame was recognized and understood .",
    "a beautiful example is the foucault s pendulum , which shows , in the context of newtonian physics , the absolute character of rotation .    at the dawn of the modern scientific era ,",
    "the notions of absolute space and time , which are fundamental in the formulation of classical laws of physics , were criticized by leibniz@xcite and berkeley@xcite ; consequently , the concepts of absolute motion , and hence , of absolute rotation , were questioned too .",
    "machs@xcite analysis of the relativity of motions revived the debate at the dawn of theory of relativity .",
    "as it is well known , mach s ideas played an important role and influenced einstein s approach .",
    "however , the peculiarity of rotation , which is inherited by newtonian physics , leads to bewildering problems even in the relativistic context . actually , after the publication of einstein s theory , those who were prejudicely contrary to relativity found , in the relativistic approach to rotation , important arguments against the self - consistency of the theory . in 1909",
    "an apparent logical contradiction in the special theory of relativity ( srt ) , applied to the case of a rotating disk , was pointed out by ehrenfest@xcite .",
    "subsequently , in 1913 , sagnac@xcite evidenced an apparent contradiction in the srt with respect to experiments performed with rotating interferometers : according to him    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ leffet interfrentiel observ [ ... ] manifeste directment lexistence de lther , support ncessaire des ondes lumineuses de huygens et de fresnel .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    since those years , both the so - called ehrenfest s paradox and the theoretical interpretation of the sagnac effect have become topical arguments of a discussion on the foundations of the srt , which is not closed yet , as the number of recent contributions confirms .",
    "we studied elsewhere@xcite the ehrenfest s paradox , and we showed that it can be solved on the basis of purely kinematical arguments in the srt . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the sagnac effect : we are going to show that it can be completely explained in the srt . to this end",
    ", we are going to give two derivations of the effect .    on the one hand , using relativistic kinematics and ,",
    "namely , the law of velocity addition , we are going to provide a ",
    "derivation of the effect .",
    "in particular , the universality of the effect - i.e. its independence from the physical nature and the velocities ( relative to the turntable ) of the interfering beams - will be explained .",
    "on the other hand , we are going to give a `` derivation by analogy '' which generalizes a previous work written by sakurai@xcite .",
    "indeed , sakurai outlined a beautiful and far - reaching analogy between the sagnac effect and the aharonov - bohm effect@xcite , and obtained a first order approximation of the sagnac effect . by generalizing sakurai s result ,",
    "we shall obtain the sagnac effect in full theory , without any approximation , evidencing that the analogy holds also in a fully relativistic context .",
    "to this end , we shall use cattaneo s 1 + 3 splitting @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that will enable us to describe the geometrodynamics of the rotating frame in a simple and powerful way : in particular , some newtonian elements used by sakurai will be generalized to a relativistic context .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : history ] a historical review of the sagnac effect is made ; in section [ sec : direct ] the direct derivation is given , while the derivation by analogy is outlined in section [ sec : sagnacab ] .",
    "finally , a thorough exposition of the foundations of cattaneo s splitting is given in appendix .",
    "the history of the interferometric detection of the effects of rotation dates back to the end of the xix century when , still in the context of the ether theory , sir oliver lodge@xcite proposed to use a large interferometer to detect the rotation of the earth .",
    "subsequently@xcite he proposed to use an interferometer rotating on a turntable in order to reveal the rotation effects with respect to the laboratory frame .",
    "a detailed description of these early works can be found in the paper by anderson _ _  et al.__@xcite , where the study of rotating interferometers is analyzed in a historical perspective . in 1913",
    "sagnac@xcite verified his early predictions@xcite , using a rapidly rotating light - optical interferometer .",
    "in fact , on the ground of classical physics , he predicted the following fringe shift ( with respect to the interference pattern when the device is at rest ) , for monochromatic light waves in vacuum , counter - propagating along a closed path in a rotating interferometer : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( constant ) angular velocity vector of the turntable , @xmath2 is the vector associated to the area enclosed by the light path , and @xmath3 is the wavelength of light in vacuum ( as seen in the local co - moving inertial frame of the light source ) .",
    "the time difference associated to the fringe shift ( [ eq : sagnac1 ] ) turns out to be @xmath4    even if his interpretation of these results was entirely in the framework of the classical ( not lorentz s ! ) ether theory , sagnac was the first scientist who reported an experimental observation of the effect of rotation in space - time , which , after him , was named ",
    "sagnac effect  .",
    "it is noteworthy to notice that the sagnac effect has been interpreted as a disproval of the srt since the early years of relativity ( in particular by sagnac himself ) up to now ( in particular by selleri@xcite,@xcite , croca - selleri@xcite , goy - selleri@xcite , vigier@xcite , anastasowski _ _ et al.__@xcite , klauber@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , this claim is incorrect . as a matter of fact",
    ", the sagnac effect can be completely explained in the framework of the srt : see for instance weber@xcite , dieks@xcite , anandan@xcite , rizzi - tartaglia@xcite , bergia - guidone @xcite , rodrigues - sharif@xcite , pascual - snchez _ _ et al.__@xcite . according to the srt ,",
    "( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) turns out to be just a first order approximation of the relativistic proper time difference between counter - propagating light beams .",
    "moreover , in what follows , it will be apparent that the relativistic interpretation of the sagnac effect allows a deeper insight into the very foundations of the srt .",
    "few years before sagnac , franz harres@xcite , graduate student in jena , observed ( for the first time but unknowingly ) the sagnac effect during his experiments on the fresnel - fizeau drag of light .",
    "however , only in 1914 , harzer@xcite recognized that the unexpected and inexplicable bias found by harres was nothing else than the manifestation of the sagnac effect .",
    "moreover , harres s observations also demonstrated that the sagnac fringe shift is unaffected by refraction : in other words , it is always given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sagnac1 ] ) , provided that @xmath3 is interpreted as the light wavelength in a co - moving refractive medium .",
    "so , the sagnac phase shift depends on the light wavelength , and not on the velocity of light in the ( co - moving ) medium .    if harres anticipated the sagnac effect on the experimental ground , michelson@xcite anticipated the effect on the theoretical side .",
    "subsequently , in 1925 , michelson himself and gale@xcite succeeded in measuring a phase shift , analogous to the sagnac s one , caused by the rotation of the earth , using a large optical interferometer .",
    "the field of light - optical sagnac interferometry had a revived interest after the development of laser ( see for instance the beautiful review paper by post@xcite , where the previous experiments are carefully described and their theoretical implications analyzed ) .",
    "after that , there was an increasing precision in measurements and a growth of technological applications , such as inertial navigation@xcite , where the  fiber - optical gyro@xcite and the  ring laser@xcite are used .",
    "the experimental data show that : ( i ) the sagnac fringe shift ( [ eq : sagnac1 ] ) does not depend either on the presence of a co - moving optical medium or on the group velocity of the counter - propagating beams ; ( ii ) the sagnac time difference ( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) does not depend either on the light wavelength or on the presence of a co - moving optical medium .",
    "this is a first important clue of the universality of the sagnac effect .",
    "however , the most compelling claim for the universal character of the sagnac effect comes from the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sagnac1 ] ) not for light beams only , but also for any kind of  entities ",
    "( such as electromagnetic and acoustic waves , classical particles and electron cooper pairs , neutron beams and de broglie waves and so on ... ) travelling in opposite directions along a closed path in a rotating interferometer , with the same ( in absolute value ) velocity with respect to the turntable . this fact is well proved by experimental texts ( see subsection [ ssec : tests ] ) .    of course the entities take different times for a complete round - trip , depending on their velocity relative to the turntable ;",
    "_ _ but the difference between these times is always given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) . _ _",
    "so , the amount of the time difference is always the same , both for matter and light waves , independently of the physical nature of the interfering beams .",
    "this astounding but experimentally well proved ",
    "universality  of the sagnac effect is quite inexplicable on the basis of the classical physics , and invokes a geometrical explanation in the minkowskian space - time of the srt .",
    "the sagnac effect with matter waves has been verified experimentally using cooper pairs@xcite in 1965 , using neutrons@xcite in 1984 , using @xmath5 atoms beams@xcite in 1991 and using electrons , by hasselbach - nicklaus@xcite , in 1993 .",
    "the effect of the terrestrial rotation on neutron phase was demonstrated in 1979 by werner et al.@xcite in a series of famous experiments .",
    "the sagnac phase shift has been derived , in the full framework of the srt , for electromagnetic waves in vacuum ( weber@xcite , dieks@xcite , anandan@xcite , rizzi - tartaglia@xcite , bergia - guidone @xcite , rodrigues - sharif@xcite ) . however , a clear and universally shared derivation for matter waves is not available as far as we know , or it is at least difficult to find it in the literature .",
    "indeed , the sagnac phase shift for matter waves has been derived , _  in the first order approximation _ with respect to the velocity of rotation of the interferometer , by many authors ( see ashby s paper in this book@xcite and the paper by hasselbach - nicklaus for discussions and further references ) .",
    "these derivations are often based on an heterogeneous mixture of classical kinematics and relativistic dynamics , or non relativistic quantum mechanics and some relativistic elements .",
    "an example of such derivations is given in a well known paper by sakurai@xcite , on the basis of a formal analogy between the classical coriolis force @xmath6 acting on a particle of mass @xmath7 moving in a uniformly rotating frame , and the lorentz force @xmath8 acting on a particle of charge @xmath9 moving in a constant magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "sakurai considers a beam of charged particles split into two different paths and then recombined .",
    "if @xmath11 is the surface domain enclosed by the two paths , the resulting phase difference in the interference region turns out to be @xmath12 therefore , @xmath13 is different from zero when a magnetic field exists inside the domain enclosed by the two paths , even if the magnetic field felt by the particles along their paths is zero .",
    "this is the well known aharonov - bohm@xcite effect . by formally substituting",
    "@xmath14 sakurai shows that the phase shift ( [ eq : phasemag ] ) reduces to @xmath15 if @xmath1 is interpreted as the angular velocity vector of the uniformly rotating turntable and @xmath2 as the vector associated to the area enclosed by the closed path along which the two counter - propagating material beams travel , then eq . (",
    "[ eq : phaseomega ] ) can be interpreted as the sagnac phase shift for the considered counter - propagating beams : is zero along the trajectories of the particles , while in sakurai s derivation , which we are going to generalize , the angular velocity @xmath1 , which is the analogue of the magnetic field for particles in a rotating frames , is not null : therefore the analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect seems to be questionable .",
    "however , the formal analogy can be easily recovered when _ the flux _ of the magnetic field , rather than the magnetic field itself , is considered : this is just what we are going to do ( see section [ sec : sagnacab ] , below ) . ]",
    "@xmath16 this result has been obtained using non relativistic quantum mechanics : the relations between the aharonov - bohm effect and the wave equations are discussed in subsection [ ssec : ab ] .",
    "the time difference corresponding to the phase difference ( [ eq : phaseomega1 ] ) , turns out to be : @xmath17 let us point out that eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltat ] ) contains , inconsistently but unavoidably , some relativistic elements ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "of course in the first order approximation , i.e. when the relativistic mass @xmath19 coincides with the rest mass @xmath7 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) ; that is , as we stressed before , a first order approximation of the relativistic time difference associated to the sagnac effect . ) and ( [ eq : deltat ] ) differ by a factor 2 : this depends on the fact that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) we considered the complete round - trip of the beams , while in this section we refer to a situation in which the emission point and the interference point are diametrically opposed.[fn : fact2 ] ]    this simple and beautiful procedure will be generalized and extended to a fully relativistic context in sec .",
    "[ sec : sagnacab ] .",
    "in this section we are going to give a description of light or matter beams counter - propagating in a rotating interferometer , based on relativistic kinematics ; here and henceforth , we shall refer to both light and matter beams by calling them simply  beams  .",
    "indeed , it is our aim to show that , under suitable conditions , the sagnac time difference does not depend on the very physical nature of the interfering beams .",
    "the beams are constrained to travel a circular path along the rim of the rotating disk , with constant angular velocity , in opposite directions .",
    "let us suppose that a beam source and an interferometric detector are lodged on a point @xmath20 of the rim of the disk .",
    "let @xmath21 be the central inertial frame , parameterized by an adapted ( see appendix a. ) set of cylindrical coordinates @xmath22 , with line element given by    @xmath23    in particular , if we confine ourselves to a the disk ( @xmath24 ) , the metric turns out to be @xmath25    with respect to @xmath21 , the disk ( whose radius is @xmath26 ) rotates with angular velocity @xmath27 , and the world - line @xmath28 of @xmath20 is @xmath29 or , eliminating @xmath30 @xmath31 the proper time read by a clock at rest in @xmath20 is given by @xmath32     ( a point on the disk where a beam source and interferometric detector are lodged ) is @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the world - lines of the co - propagating ( + ) and counter - propagating ( - ) beams .",

    ": @xmath66    this condition means that the beams are required to have the same velocity ( in absolute value ) in every lcif , provided that every licf is einstein - synchronized .",
    "if condition ( [ eq : lec ] ) is imposed , the proper time difference ( [ eq : deltatau12 ] ) reduces to @xmath67 which is the relativistic sagnac time difference .",
    "a very relevant conclusion follows . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : taupiumeno ] ) , the beams take different times - as measured by the clock at rest on the starting - ending point @xmath68 on the platform - for a complete round trip , depending on their velocities @xmath62 relative to the turnable .",
    "however , when condition ( [ eq : lec ] ) is imposed , the difference @xmath69 between these times does depend _ only _ on the angular velocity @xmath27 of the disk , and it does not depend on the velocities of propagation of the beams with respect the turnable .",
    "this is a very general result , which has been obtained on the ground of a purely kinematical approach .",
    "the sagnac time difference ( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) applies to any couple of ( physical or even mathematical ) entities , as long as a velocity with respect the turnable can be consistently defined . in particular , this result applies as well to photons ( for which @xmath70 ) and to any kind of classical or quantum particles under the given conditions ( or electromagnetic / acustic waves in presence of an homogeneous co - moving medium ) .",
    "this fact highlights , in a clear and straightforward way , the universality of the sagnac effect .",
    "more in particular , the sagnac time difference ( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) also applies to the fourier components of the wave packets associated to a couple of matter beams counter - propagating ( with the same relative velocity ) along the rim .",
    "this remark is important to study the interferometric detectability of the sagnac effect ( see subsection [ ssec : detsagnac ] below ) .",
    "as we said in the introduction , the sagnac effect for electromagnetic waves in vacuum was first interpreted by sagnac himself as an experimental evidence of the physical existence of the classical ( non relativistic ) ether , and an experimental disproval of the srt .",
    "sagnac s interpretation can be easily understood , on the basis of the relativistic eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatau11 ] ) , as a casual consequence of a well known kinematical feature of light propagation through the ether .",
    "indeed , the light velocity with respect to the ether ( at rest in the central if ) must be @xmath71 in both directions ; as a consequence , if we set @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatau11 ] ) , the proper time difference @xmath69 reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) ; the latter , in turn , reduces , at first order approximation , to the time difference given in eq . ( [ eq : sagnac2 ] ) , which was actually predicted and experimentally tested by sagnac .",
    "however , any non relativistic explanation completely fails for subluminally travelling entities ( such as matter waves , sound waves , electromagnetic waves in an homogeneous co - moving medium , and so on ) .",
    "in fact , for subluminally travelling entities the vital condition is :  equal relative velocity in opposite directions  . if this condition is expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lec ] ) ( which explicitly requires the local einstein synchronization ) the sagnac proper time difference ( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) arises , as we carefully showed before .    on the contrary ,",
    "if the condition  equal relative velocity in opposite directions  is expressed by an analogous relation , in which the local einstein synchronization is replaced by a synchronization borrowed from the global synchronization of the central if ( see subsection [ ssec : synchro ] ) , no time difference arises .",

    "( [ eq : betaunobeta ] ) , could be naively presumed as a reasonable approximation in non - relativistic motion : however , this choice simply cancels the effect !",
    "this shows that , according to a very appropriate remark by dieks and nienhuis @xcite , the observed sagnac effect is an experimental evidence of the srt at first order approximation with respect to @xmath83 , and an experimental disproval of the classical ( non relativistic ) ether . +",
    "* remark * it could be always possible to substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : lec ] ) with an alternative suitable condition , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bla ] ) turns out to be equal to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) .",
    "such a condition is : @xmath84 but , of course , this is an extremely  ad hoc  condition , which translates the simple and expressive condition ( [ eq : lec ] ) : it is clear that the physical interpretation of ( [ eq : lecr_iner ] ) is not as evident as that of ( [ eq : lec ] ) .",
    "with regard to the interferometric detection of the sagnac effect , the crucial point is the following one . consider the fourier components of the wave packets associated to a couple of matter beams counter - propagating , with the same group velocity , along the rim .",
    "despite the lack of a direct physical meaning and energy transfer , the phase velocity of these fourier components complies with the lorentz law of velocity addition ( [ eq : betaunobeta ] ) , and is the same for both the co - rotating and counter - rotating fourier components . as a consequence ,",
    "the sagnac time difference ( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) also applies to any couple of fourier components with the same phase velocity .",
    "moreover , the interferometric detection of the sagnac effect requires that the wave packet associated to the matter beam should be sharp enough in the frequency space , to allow the appearance , in the interferometric region , of an observable fringe shift .",
    "it may be worth recalling that :    \\(i ) the observable fringe shift @xmath85 depends on the phase velocity of the fourier components of the wave packet ;    \\(ii ) with respect to an einstein - synchronized lcif , the velocity of every fourier component of the wave packet associated to the matter beam , moving with the velocity ( in absolute value ) @xmath86 , * *  * * is given by the de broglie expression @xmath87 .",
    "the consequent sagnac phase shift , due to the relativistic time difference ( [ eq : deltatausagnac ] ) , is @xmath88      as we mentioned , the sagnac time delay for matter beams has been derived by many authors in many different ways , but almost always in the first order approximation . however , digging into the literature , we eventually found , between the preliminary and the final version of this paper , a couple of derivations of the sagnac effect for matter beams in full srt . in this section",
    "we are going to compare these approaches to ours .",
    "dieks and nienhuis@xcite move from the standard lorentz transformation from the lcif to the central if . in order to be as clear and self - consistent as possible",
    ", we shall translate everything into our notations .",
    "consider two near events , happening along the rim , belonging to the world - line of the co - rotating / counter - rotating beam ; let @xmath89 , d@xmath90 be the space and time separation between these events , as measured in an einstein - synchronized lcif .",
    "then the corresponding time separation @xmath91 , as measured in the central if , is given by the usual lorentz transformation @xmath92 where the @xmath51 and @xmath52 hold for the co - rotating and counter - rotating beams , respectively .",
    "gluing together all lcifs , at the end of the round trip we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the length of the rim of the platform , as seen on the platform itself .",
    "the difference between the equations for the co - rotating and counter - rotating beams is : @xmath95    in the derivation given by dieks and nienhuis , two hypotheses play a vital role in order to get the correct conclusion : ( i ) the integration domain @xmath94 is @xmath96 ( ii ) @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the relative velocity ( in absolute value ) of both the co - rotating and the counter - rotating beam ( as a consequence , @xmath99 ) .    of course , the two hypotheses are correct , but both deserve further remarks .",
    "first of all , we could say that hypothesis ( i ) is unnecessary : indeed , our derivation of the sagnac effect does not depend on the hyperbolic features of the space geometry of the disk ( see subsection [ ssec : relspace ] and appendix a. ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this hypothesis establishes a very interesting link between the ( observable ) sagnac time delay and the ( unobservable ) lengthening of the rim of the rotating platform , which , in turn , depends on the peculiar space geometry of the disk .",
    "this is a challenge to those authors ( see for instance @xcite,@xcite ) who try to conciliate the sagnac time delay with the euclidean space geometry of the disk .      the long review paper by malykin@xcite ( almost 300 references ! ) starts with the remark that the sagnac effect for matter beams  is explained in several totally different ways  , but - strangely enough - most of them give ",
    "correct results despite their obvious incorretness  . after a wide overview of these  incorrect explanations ",
    ", the author provides his attempt of solution on the basis of the relativistic law of velocity addition .",
    "this approach is the only one that turns out to be similar to ours ; also the problem of the interferometric detection of the sagnac effect is taken into account .",
    "of course , this leads to the issue of the kinematical behavior of both the phase velocity and the group velocity . here",
    "some misinterpretations and confusions arise . in particular",
    ", the author tries to show that  both the group velocity and the phase velocity have identical translational properties during the transition from the frame of reference k [ the central if ] to the frame of reference k [ the lcif ]  .",
    "actually , the group velocity behaves contrary to the phase velocity with respect to the ( local ) lorentz transformation group .",
    "however , this has no consequences on the interferometric detection of the sagnac effect , because the only relevant requirement is that , with respect to any einstein - synchronized lcif : ( i ) the group velocities should be the same ; ( ii ) the phase velocities of the fourier components should be the same .",
