    "intermittent chaos is the phenomenon shown by systems exhibiting long sequences of periodic - like behaviour , the laminar phases , separated by comparatively short chaotic eruptions .",
    "intermittent chaotic systems have been extensively studied since the original proposals by pomeau and manneville @xcite classifying type - i , ii , and iii instabilities when the floquet multipliers of a map crosses the unity circle .",
    "although other mechanisms may occur leading to intermittency these three cases are the most simple and most frequently encountered in low dimensional systems .",
    "the class of intermittent chaos studied by pomeau and manneville includes the tangent bifurcation , leading to intermittency of type i , when the floquet s multiplier for the associated map crosses the circle of complex numbers with unitary norm through @xmath2 ; the hopf bifurcation , leading to type - ii intermittency , which appears as two complex eigenvalues of the floquet s matrix cross the unitary circle off the real axis ; and the sub - critical period doubling , leading to type - iii intermittency , whose critical floquet s multiplier is @xmath3 .",
    "many experimental evidences for these intermittent behavior have appeared in the literature .",
    "the type - iii has been reported for electronic nonlinear devices @xcite , lasers @xcite , and biological tissues @xcite . a signature for this intermittency",
    "is given by the critical exponent describing the dependence of average length of nearly periodic phases , that is , laminar phases , with the control parameter .",
    "histograms of number of laminar phases longer than a given duration are related to the normal form nonlinearity describing the system @xcite .",
    "different nonlinear power in the model imply different exponents , as described by kodama _",
    "et al . _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the exponent for the average length of laminar phases as function of the reinjection probability .",
    "herein another average is explored to characterize the intermittency and its nonlinearity .",
    "it is the average of one variable of the system . near bifurcation",
    ", approximate expressions for the natural measure , or probability density , are obtained for a map with type - iii intermittency , in section [ sec : map ] .",
    "critical exponents are defined from analytical approximations and shown to be useful in characterizing the bifurcation .",
    "numerical experiments with the maps are presented in section [ sec : numerical ] , verifying the proposed exponents . to test in a real physical system , a nonlinear circuit with a diode , similar to the one used in the early demonstrations of chaotic universal properties @xcite , was set up as described in section [ sec : circuit ] and used to verify the exponents .",
    "the voltage across the diode , which is a dynamical variable of the system , was simultaneously measured in time series and average .",
    "the type - iii intermittency bifurcation is well characterized both , using the experimental next peak value map and the average .",
    "to establish the new critical exponents for the averages one begins with the normal form of the map that has type - iii intermittency @xcite    @xmath4    the bifurcation , when @xmath5 ceases to be a stable fixed point , occurs at @xmath6 .",
    "the second application of this map , in the approximation of small @xmath7 and x is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 .",

    "the simple case @xmath22 reduces to @xmath23    for @xmath24 the general asymptotic expression is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the new exponent , whose value is    @xmath27    this is the exponent that can be extracted from numerical and experimental systems to obtain the value of @xmath21 .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for the second iterated map with negative values of @xmath12 . if the original first iterated map , giving eq .",
    "( [ eq : map3 ] ) is fully odd in @xmath12 the total average must be zero . once the reinjection or the map is not symmetrical , i.  e. , the value of some even nonlinear power ( less than @xmath21 ) is non zero , the exponents of the averages can be obtained from the second iterate maps as eq .",
    "( [ eq : map3 ] ) .",
    "a detailed study of these symmetry properties will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one must recall that , in type - iii intermittent chaos , an exponent already exists in the literature for the average length of laminar phases , given by @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "the simple relation exists , giving @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath21 varies through @xmath30 the relative variation of these exponents are @xmath31 .",
    "this means equal or better sensitivity in the determination of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the most important fact is that those two exponents should be searched for independently in any experiment .",
    "to test the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) numerically the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) was restricted to @xmath33 by a modulo one reinjection : when the iterate gives @xmath34 or @xmath35 the integer part is subtracted .",
    "averages were obtained directly from iterates of the map starting from random initial condition .",
    "a transient of @xmath36 iterates was eliminated from a total of @xmath37 calculated values at each of @xmath38 steps of @xmath7 , between zero and @xmath39 . for the average to be non null the value of @xmath40 has to be different of zero .",
    "this breaks the symmetry between positive and negative values of x. once the average is non null , its behavior for small @xmath18 follows eq .",

    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : avealpha ] .",
    "the @xmath41 case , where the average is always zero , is not represented .",
    "[ htbp ]    the same slope is obtained for the averages with different values of @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting averages have the same dependence in @xmath18 as the one obtained from the map of second iterates ( eq .  ( [ eq : map3 ] ) ) , calculated with the same number of iterates ; all coinciding with the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : avexz3 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : avez ] shows numerically calculated averages obtained directly from iterates of the map eq .",
    "( [ eq : map3 ] ) , when @xmath22 and @xmath43 .",

    "a transient of @xmath44 iterates was eliminated from a total of @xmath45 calculated values at each of @xmath38 steps of @xmath18 , between zero and @xmath46 .",
    "[ htbp ]    for @xmath47 the @xmath22 and @xmath48 results are very well superimposed by the analytical curves made from equation  ( [ eq : avexz3 ] ) , with @xmath49 , and equation  ( [ eq : avexz ] ) , with @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the two behaviors are clearly distinguished in the log - log plot . for",
    "the purpose of comparison with the already established exponents one should notice that the exponents for the average laminar phase are given in @xcite as @xmath51 that is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , verifying @xmath54 .",
    "up to this point all results have concerned discrete maps .",
    "dynamical fluxes with associated maps having intermittent chaos show similar critical exponents for the average of its continuous variables . this has been verified numerically with tangent bifurcation of type - i intermittency @xcite and will be demonstrated here for a physical chaotic oscillator . for the type - iii intermittency the map extracted from a flux has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map3 ] ) for its second iterates .",
    "a discretely sampled continuous flux may be viewed as a finite set of discrete stroboscopic maps , all with the same stroboscopic frequency but stroboscopic phases ranging from 0 to @xmath55 in uniformly separated steps .",
    "the number of such maps gives the ratio of sampling frequency to stroboscopic frequency .",
    "the time average of the continuous flux is the average of the time averages of these maps .",
    "if a map from this series is nonsymmetrical , only in very special cases it would happen that this asymmetry be exactly canceled by the summation on the other maps .",
    "thus , in general , its expected that if the flux leads to a nonsymmetrical map ( no odd symmetry with respect to the unstable fixed point ) the average of its continuous variable will exhibit the same exponent @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) .",
    "the physical experimental system to test the above exponents consisted of an rlc series circuit , where a nonlinear capacitance was implemented by a p - n junction diode @xcite .",
    "the circuit , presented in figure [ fig : circuit ] , was driven by a frequency and amplitude controllable oscillator with output impedance of @xmath56 ohms .",
    "an inductor of @xmath57 henry , an external resistor of @xmath58 ohms and a ( typical 1n4007 ) diode formed the circuit , whose linear oscillation regime had resonance frequency at @xmath59 khz .",
    "[ htbp ]    dynamical bifurcations were produced by scanning the external drive frequency .",
    "time series of the value of the voltage across the diode and the current in the circuit were collect with a @xmath60 bits resolution converter .",
    "the sampling rate was @xmath61 sample / s .",
    "thus @xmath62 points were saved on each oscillator cycle . capturing @xmath63 points at each value of the control frequency , a simple software searched for the maxima in the series . in wide",
    "range scans the typical bifurcation diagrams given by the peak value of the voltage across the diode , show clearly the well known results of period doubling cascades , chaotic windows and tangent bifurcations from chaos into periodic windows .",
    "@xcite .    a specific bifurcation , with intermittency and no bistability , was found and studied , scanning the external oscillator frequency from @xmath64 hz to @xmath65 hz by @xmath66 equal small steps .",
    "the drive voltage amplitude was fixed at @xmath67  v. the circuit was mounted inside an isolating box to prevent thermal drift effects @xcite .",
    "the value of a control parameter @xmath18 is obtained as the frequency detuning step divided by the critical frequency of the bifurcation , @xmath68  hz . thus @xmath18 varied in the range of @xmath69@xmath39 . a segment of the voltage pulses",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : pulses ] .",
    "the signature of type - iii intermittency is observed with the laminar events corresponding to the uniform oscillations alternating their peak value around 1v .",
    "[ htbp ]    multibranch maps constructed from the maxima of the voltage across the diode , extracted from series with @xmath70 , could be approximated to one - dimensional ones , expected in the limit of infinite dissipation .",
    "second return maps and laminar phase histograms , not shown here , indicate type - iii intermittency .",
    "figure  [ fig : histogram ] shows the average length of laminar phases for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "each histogram used was obtained with @xmath70 points .",
    "a theoretical fitting @xcite is best with an exponent @xmath71 . notice that for the map the predictions are @xmath72 for @xmath22 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "however the experimental data always has excess of laminar events identified with short length @xcite and this effect gives a bigger experimental value for @xmath32 in the fittings .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is the best odd value.the excess of short laminar phase events may be related to the finite dissipation rate in the phase space of the experimental system and the consequent non unidimensional maps and also to a nonuniform density of probability for the reinjection , as discussed by kim  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "[ htbp ]    the peak value of the voltage , which gave the second return map and the histograms is shown in figure  [ fig : expave](a ) .",
    "the laminar phases are the oscillations with repetitive visits to the maximum value near @xmath75 in the figure .",
    "as the segments represented in figure  [ fig : pulses](a ) are short in time for many values of parameters they show a single laminar event with all points accumulated around the unstable orbit .",
    "also shown is the simultaneously acquired average of the voltage across the diode .",
    "it was obtained with a simple electronic integrator , having a time constant of @xmath76 seconds . to account for long laminar phase events and ( which is equivalent ) decrease the average fluctuations the scan lasted 50 minutes .",
    "[ htbp ]    the experimental average voltage was fitted to the expression @xmath77 the exponent @xmath78 gave an excellent agreement with the experimental plot , as shown in figure  [ fig : expave ] .",
    "attempts of fittings to higher values of @xmath21 , i.e. , to eq .",
    "( [ eq : avexz ] ) , failed .",
    "it is worth noticing that the value predicted for @xmath74 is @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the experimental average consistently verifies @xmath22 for the nonlinearity of this bifurcation in the circuit .",
    "the confidence for the experimental values of @xmath32 and @xmath26 from fittings using standard @xmath80 procedure is better than 2% .",
    "therefore , the result @xmath81 shows that a discrepancy remains between the experiments and the unidimensional map model .",
    "while the bigger value obtained for @xmath32 has been attributed to an excess of short laminar phase events  @xcite no such study of deviations exists for the exponent in the averages .",
    "in conclusion , critical exponents for the averages of one dynamical variable are established analytically for type - iii intermittent chaotic maps .",
    "those exponents are directly related to the nonlinear power law of the normal form of the maps .",
    "they have a simple relation with the exponents of the average length of laminar iterates in the same systems .",
    "all these properties were verified in numerical experiments with maps .",
    "physical experiments with a continuous flux were also done to demonstrate the exponents in averages .",
    "the average voltage across a diode in a chaotic electronic circuit was measured while the drive frequency was scanned through bifurcations .",
    "a bifurcation from chaos into periodic pulsation , shown to be type - iii intermittent , gives an exponent in agreement with the cubic nonlinearity .",
    "this result is consistently verified in the exponents of the average length of laminar phases , extracted from histograms of the peak pulse voltages in the circuit .",
    "averages of dynamical variables have been proposed to get the signature of the lorenz chaos bifurcation @xcite , have been numerically studied in critical bifurcations @xcite , and experimentally measured in bifurcating pulsed lasers @xcite .",
    "however no systematic study of critical exponents have been done .",
    "the technique of measuring averages of dynamical variable in intermittent chaos is a complementary procedure to investigate bifurcations of nonlinear systems .",
    "the experimental average may also be advantageous when detection noise for an specific variable has a bandwidth overlapping the frequency bandwidth of the chaotic oscillations . for systems with high frequency noise",
    "it is naturally bound to be more sensitive .",
    "its experimental motivation is therefore enhanced to characterize ultrafast chaotic oscillators , like diode lasers , using slow time detection techniques .",
    "one extension relevant to the work presented here is the study of the exponents for the averages in bifurcations with nonuniform reinjection in the intermittency , as studied by kim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . a relation between exponents of the averages and the exponents of the average length of laminar phases events should exist generalizing the @xmath82 given here .",
    "another potential use for the averages near bifurcation would be to complement the confrontation between experimental data and model as extracted from nonlinear data analysis @xcite .",
    "the models inferred from the data analysis must have bifurcations consistent with the experimental system .",
