    "the cim achieved a good approximation rate of 0.94148 on average and found better cut compared to the gw for 69 out of 71 graphs in g - set .",
    "the computation time for this sparse graph set , including few sessions of hysteretic optimization , is estimated as @xmath144 ms .",
    "the time scaling was also tested on complete graphs of number of vertices up to @xmath0 and number of edges up to @xmath1 .",
    "the results imply that cim achieves empirically constant time scaling in a fixed system clock frequency , i.e. , the fixed cavity circulation frequency ( fiber length ) , while sa , sg3 , and bls scale as @xmath145 and gw scales as @xmath132 .",
    "those results suggest that cim may find applications in high - speed computation for various combinatorial optimization problems , in particular for temporal networks .",
    "the present simulation results do not mean that the cim can get a reasonably accurate solution by a constant time for arbitrary large problem size .",
    "as mentioned already , in the cim based on a fiber ring resonator , the number of dopo pulses is determined by the the fiber length and the pulse spacing . in order to implement @xmath146 and @xmath147 dopo pulses in the @xmath148 fiber ring cavity , we must use a pulse repetition frequency to 2 ghz and 20 ghz , respectively .",
    "this is a challenge for both optical components and electronic components of cim , but certainly within a reach in current technologies .",
