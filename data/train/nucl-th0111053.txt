    "the form factors we derive can be applied in higher - order dynamical calculations of two - body breakup reactions , such as the continuum discretized coupled - channels calculations @xcite , or in numerical methods that evolve the two - body wave function in coordinate space @xcite .",

    "the magnetization current , on the other hand , is ignored for simplicity .",
    "we assume that the relative velocity of the interacting nuclei is a constant , so that the retardation effect associated with a time - dependent velocity can be ignored .",
    "the multipole expansion of the interaction contains both diagonal and off - diagonal multipole components .",
