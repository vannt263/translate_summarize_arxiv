    ", this explains e.g. why the most recent compilation of solar abundances @xcite does not provide any result for the photospheric abundance of this element while the meteoritic result is well establised .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the lines identified as sb i in the solar spectrum @xcite are severely blended but also to the fact that reliable oscillator strengths are still lacking for these transitions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report experimental lifetimes for 12 sb  i levels measured with time - resolved laser - induced fluorescence ( tr - lif ) spectroscopy .",

    "a laser - produced plasma was created by focusing a 10 hz frequency doubled nd : yag laser onto a rotating antimony target , placed inside a vacuum chamber with a pressure of @xmath19 millibar .",
    "the produced plasma contained free antimony atoms in the ground and excited states .",
    "antimony atoms in low lying levels were selectively excited to the states under investigation and the subsequent fluorescence light was monitored as a function of time .",
    "the atoms were excited by crossing the ablation plasma 1 cm above the target with a ( typically ) 1.2 ns duration pulse from a dye laser pumped by a nd : yag laser .",
    "the pump laser pulses were shortened using stimulated brillouin scattering .",
    "the desired wavelengths were obtained using a dcm dye , making the laser tunable between 600 and 660 nm .",
    "bbo and kdp doubling and tripling crystals were used to reach shorter wavelength .",
    "in addition , a hydrogen raman shifter was used to change the frequency of the light by one or more stokes or anti - stokes shifts . the delay between the ablation and excitation pulses",
    "was tuned to make the plasma contain only slow atoms , decreasing flight - in and flight - out effects and collisional quenching . for all 6s - levels , except @xmath0p@xmath8 , the pumping laser was tuned to excite from the ground @xmath4s@xmath20 state ( fig .",
    "because of the strong reabsorption from the ground state , saturation effects turned out to be very important resulting in far too long experimental 6s lifetimes unless there was a long delay between the ablation and excitation laser pulses , leading to a plasma of sufficiently low - density . this effect is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . in the case of 6s @xmath0p@xmath8 level ,",
    "the excitation was from the 5p@xmath1  @xmath0p@xmath20 level where no such effect could be seen and a typical delay of around 5 @xmath21s was used .    the fluorescence signal was focused on a 1/8 m monochromator , equipped with a pmt microchannel plate ( hamamatsu r1564 ) to detect the fluorescence signal .",
    "the laser pulse was detected separately with a photodiode .",
    "the fluorescence signal and the temporal shape of the laser pulse were recorded simultaneously with a transient digitizer and averaged over 1000 laser pulses .",
    "the short lifetimes were extracted by least square fitting of the fluorescence signal with a single exponential convoluted with the shape of the laser pulse , and a background function .",
    "long lifetimes ( @xmath22ns ) were extracted by fitting a single exponential and a background function to the fluorescence signal after the excitation pulse had died off completely .",
    "when possible we used different channels for excitation and detection of the fluorescence and more than one pump and/or detection channel as seen in table  i. however , in some cases only one channel was accessible , and the pumping and detection had to be done in the same channel .    in table",
    "i we report the excitation and detection ( fluorescence ) wavelengths , and the scheme used to excite the levels .",

    "the fourth column gives our theoretical lifetimes calculated with the mcdhf model and corrected by the experimental transition energies of hassini _",
    "in order to calculate the lifetimes of the 6s and 5d levels measured in this work , we have used the mcdhf method implemented in the grasp2k computer package @xcite . in this method , the atomic state functions ( asf ) , @xmath23 , are expanded in linear combinations of configuration state functions ( csf ) , @xmath24 , according to @xmath25    the csfs are in turn linear combinations of slater determinants constructed from monoelectronic spin - orbitals of the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the large and the small component of the radial wave functions , and the angular functions @xmath29 are the spinor spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 represent all the one - electron and intermediate quantum numbers needed to completely define the csf .",
    "@xmath31 is usually chosen as the @xmath30 corresponding to the csf with the largest weight @xmath32 .",

    "the sign before the parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) corresponds to the coupling relation between the electron orbital momentum , @xmath36 , and its spin , i.e. @xmath37 the radial functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are numerically represented on a logarithmic grid and are required to be orthonormal within each @xmath33 symmetry . in the mcdhf variational procedure , the radial functions and the expansion coefficients @xmath38 are optimized to self - consistency .",
    "we considered the active space ( as ) method for building the mcdhf multiconfiguration expansions .",
    "the latter are produced by exciting the electrons from the reference configurations to a given set of orbitals .",
    "the rules adopted for generating the configuration space differ according to the correlation model being used . within a given correlation model , the as of orbitals spanning the configuration space",
    "is increased to monitor the convergence of the total energies and the transition probabilities .",
    "the mcdhf calculations have been carried out in 6 steps .    in the first step , the core orbitals , i.e. 1s to 4d , together with the 5s and 5p orbitals",
    ", have been optimized .",
    "the 6 csf belonging to the ground configuration 5s@xmath05p@xmath1 were retained in the configuration space .",
    "the energy functional was built within the framework of the average level ( al ) option @xcite .",
    "the second step consisted in increasing the configuration space by considering all the 62 csf belonging to the following configurations : 5s@xmath05p@xmath1 + 5s@xmath05p@xmath0\\{6s,6p,5d}@xmath11 .",
    "the 6s , 6p and 5d orbitals have been optimized keeping the others fixed to their values of the first step .",
    "the al option was chosen to build the energy functional .    in the third step ,",
    "the configuration space has been extended to 13640 csf by considering the single and double virtual electron excitations to the active orbital set \\{5s,5p,5d,6s,6p,6d } from the multireference configurations 5s@xmath05p@xmath1 + 5s@xmath05p@xmath0\\{6s,6p,5d}@xmath11 . only the 6d orbital has been optimized fixing all the others to the values of the preceeding step using an energy functional built from the lowest 62 asf within the framework of the extended optimal level ( eol ) option @xcite .",
    "one can notice that , from this step of the computation and on , core - valence and core - core correlations are also considered through the single and double excitations of the 5s core electrons , respectively .",
    "the last three steps consisted in extending further the configuration space by adding to the active set of the preceeding steps the following orbitals : 7s , 7p and 7d in the fourth step giving rise to 41 603 csf ; 8s , 8p and 8d in the fifth step generating 85 130 csf ; and finally , 4f in the last step with 118 912 csf generated . in these steps ,",
    "only the added orbitals have been optimized , the others being fixed using the same energy functional as in the third step ; also , single and double virtual electron excitations from the same multireference configurations as in the third step have been used to generate the configuration spaces .",
    "further orbital additions to the active set as well as further opening of the core to include more core - valence and core - core correlations have been prevented by the memory limitations of our computer .",

    "the mcdhf lifetimes of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 levels as computed in the babushkin and the coulomb gauges are plotted as function of the computation step .",
    "the values of the last step can be compared to our tr - lif measurement for the @xmath39 level and to the delayed coincidence measurement of osherovich & tezikov @xcite for the @xmath40 level .",
    "as one can see , in the case of @xmath39 , the calculated lifetime converges in both gauges to the experimental value whereas it clearly diverges in the case of @xmath40 .",
    "the divergence of the mcdhf lifetime was also noticed for the @xmath41 levels not shown here .",
    "these three 5d states are probably not properly represented due to missing correlations , e.g. with @xmath13f and @xmath13 g ( @xmath42 ) orbitals .    in table",
    "[ life ] , we report the mcdhf energies of the levels for which lifetime measurements are available . the corresponding mcdhf lifetimes and transition probabilities of main decay branches ( presented in table  [ trans ] ) have been corrected by the experimental transition energies of hassini _",

    "@xcite as already stated in the previous section .",
    "values affected by convergence problems are marked with an asterisk .",
    "all the computed values reported here are without breit and qed interactions .",
    "rough estimates of the importance of these interactions on the lifetimes have been established in the second step of the computation ; the lifetimes changed by less than 5% .",
    "the 12 measured levels in sb  i are reported in table  ii . among them , 7 levels had not been previously considered .    comparing the tr - lif lifetimes from this work with values in the literature , we agree within the uncertainties with belin _",
    "_ @xcite and andersen _",
    "however , there is a clear discrepancy when comparing to osherovich & tezikov @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lifetimes within the 5d @xmath4f term differ by more than a factor of six , see figure 3 . only the three levels with the lowest @xmath6-values ( 3/2 , 5/2 and 7/2 )",
    "are measured in this term .",
    "the level with the highest j - value , @xmath4f@xmath43 , is metastable since there are no odd levels with @xmath44 below 57 000 @xmath7 to which it can decay through an electric dipole transition .",
    "the shortest lifetime is that of @xmath45 ( 7.8 ns ) .",
    "this can be explained by the large mixing with 5d @xmath4p@xmath9 which opens up a strong decay channel to the ground level @xmath4s@xmath20 , decreasing the lifetime .",
    "the level 5d @xmath4f@xmath8 mixes with 5d @xmath4p@xmath8 , but not as much as in the previous case , and the transition to @xmath4s@xmath20 is weaker giving the longer lifetime of 19.5 ns . the level 5d @xmath4f@xmath46 has a too large @xmath6-value to mix with the 5d @xmath4p since level mixing can only occur between levels with the same @xmath6-value .",
    "however , this level is mixed with @xmath0f , opening up the channel down to 5p@xmath1 @xmath0d@xmath47 .",
    "the experimental lifetimes for the levels in the @xmath4f term are nicely reproduced by the theoretical calculation .      a comparison between experimental and calculated lifetimes is also shown in table  [ life ] .",
    "the calculated level energies appear systematically but consistently lower than the experimental results by a few hundreds @xmath7 .",
    "our mcdhf calculations are in agreement with our lif measurements and with the values of belin _",
    "_ @xcite and andersen _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , whereas the values of osherovich & tezikov @xcite seem to have larger uncertainties than quoted .",
    "a good agreement is found between our mcdhf and tr - lif lifetimes with most of the calculated values being within the error bars .",
    "moreover , one can observe the good agreement between the coulomb and babushkin gauges for most of the mcdhf lifetimes .",
    "this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "it should be emphasized that this agreement was not observed in the earlier mc+ci @xcite and ohfs calculations @xcite .",
    "discrepancies between the two gauges reaching a factor of two and more are however observed for the three high excitation levels at 56 698 , 57 597 and 58 862 @xmath7 due to the convergence problems mentioned in the previous section .",
    "albeit the hf+mc calculations of gonzalez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite show an excellent agreement with our measurements for the 6s levels , we have a completely different situation as far as the 5d levels are concerned .",
    "the latters were not published in @xcite and we have therefore calculated them using the model kindly provided by these authors .    regarding the previous measurements , the beam - foil data @xcite and the hanle measurements @xcite have been confirmed by our tr - lif lifetimes , whilst the beam - foil values for the 6s  @xmath0d@xmath12 levels are significantly shorter than our mcdhf predictions .",
    "the problem is probably originating from the mcdhf values because these two 6s @xmath0d levels are strongly mixed with 5d levels ( which is not the case for the other levels of the same configuration ) , the dominant percentages being less than 25% in jj coupling for these two levels .",
    "the better agreement theory - experiment observed for the hf+mc is probably due to the fact that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used a semi - empirical optimization procedure , the results of the present work being purely theoretical .",
    "the delay coincidence measurements of osherovich & tezikov @xcite and of tezikov @xcite are , on the other hand , found to be significantly shorter or longer than our experimental and theoretical lifetimes .",
    "this is also true for the 6s  @xmath0p@xmath48 level where the only previous experimental lifetimes are obtained by the delayed coincidence technique @xcite .",
    "however , we note that in their branching fraction measurements guern & lotrian @xcite proposed a lifetime of 3.7@xmath490.7 ns for this level from a boltzmann plot .",
    "this value is in close agreement with both our tr - lif and mcdhf results .",
    "the corrected mcdhf transition probabilities , along with the corresponding oscillator strengths and branching fractions , are reported in table  [ trans ] for the main decay transitions depopulating the even levels presented in table  [ life ] . a good agreement between the gauges",
