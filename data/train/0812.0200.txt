    "when we consider the cosmological data from wmap , supernovae ia , galaxy clustering on large scales , and cross - correlations between galaxies and the cmb , we are faced with several possible conclusions .",
    "one is that we live in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe currently dominated by either a cosmological constant or repulsive dark energy .",
    "the best fit for the dimensionless energy density parameters are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , within the concordance @xmath3cdm model @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this model is that nearly all available observational data supports it ; the disadvantage is that it requires the vast majority of the energy density in the universe to be in two unknown substances , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "this conclusion rests on the accuracy of our current gravity model , general relativity .",
    "the key equation of general relativity , einstein s equation , relates the curvature and the expansion rate of the universe to its matter and energy content .",
    "the current paradigm is to modify the matter content of the universe , by including dark matter and dark energy , to account for observations .",
    "instead , however , we might modify how the universe curves in response to matter , which would mean modifying our theory of gravity .",
    "there are many possible ways to modify gravity , depending on what one wishes to `` fix '' .",
    "for example , mond @xcite removes the need for dark matter to account for galactic rotation curves and has several other interesting results , but seems to fail at the scale of galaxy clusters , with even optimistic accountings needing roughly as much dark matter as baryonic matter . at the other end",
    "is something like dgp or conformal gravity , which hopes to account for the acceleration of the universe without invoking a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are other models which seek to unify dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "what we seek to do in this paper is to study the problem more phenomologically .",
    "for example , regardless of how the force law for gravity is modified , it will often be stronger or weaker , relative to the standard model , at larger or shorter scales .",
    "one way to parameterize this is to introduce a modified yukawa - like potential for a point mass : @xmath4 @xcite where @xmath5 indicates the strength and @xmath6 the scale ( constant in physical rather than comoving coordinates ) on which this modification is most relevant . on scales smaller than @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 reduces to the standard newtonian potential ; on larger scales it transitions to the newtonian potential multiplied by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "this is similar to the interaction considered in @xcite , in which a long range dark matter interaction is introduced yielding a different yukawa - like potential that instead modifies gravity on short length scales .",
    "note that this is not a cosmological model : there is no prescription for determining things like the expansion factor and the resulting hubble factor . like previous workers",
    ", we will assume that these are the same as in the standard cosmology .",
    "the main goal of studying such a model is to gain intuition for some generic effects of modifications to standard gravity .",
    "for example , in the linear theory of such a model , the growth of fluctuations is @xmath0-dependent @xcite  it is not in standard gravity . as a result ,",
    "a smooth spherical region within which the density is the same as the background universe will evolve .",
    "this qualitatively different behavior from standard gravity has not been emphasized  so it is worth showing the argument explicitly .",
    "consider the density field smoothed on scale @xmath9 at some early time @xmath10 .",
    "we can write this field in terms of its fourier modes , and the ( fourier transform of the ) smoothing kernel as @xmath11 the linearly evolved field is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the linear theory growth factor . in standard gravity",
    ", @xmath13 is independent of @xmath0 , so if @xmath14 then @xmath15 also .",
    "but if @xmath13 depends on @xmath0 , then if @xmath16 at some time @xmath17 , it will , in general , be non - zero at other times ( the exception being if the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath18 happens to exactly cancels that of @xmath13 ) .",
    "for the yukawa - like modification considered here , the @xmath0 dependence of the spherical top hat filter does not cancel that of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we are led to the rather remarkable conclusion that , when the gravitational potential has been modified , then linear theory predicts that a spherical tophat patch within which the density is the same as the background will evolve ! the reason why can be traced to the fact that birkhoff s theorem no longer applies once the newtonian potential has been modified . without this theorem , the spherical top hat filter is no longer special , and our common sense prejudice from standard gravity  that initially overdense regions become denser , underdense regions less dense , but regions within which the density is the same as the background do not evolve  must be treated with caution .",
    "the evolution of nonlinear clustering in this model has been studied using numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "our goal in what follows is to provide a framework for understanding this nonlinear evolution more completely . to this end",
    ", we will use the spherical evolution model , which has found extensive use in the standard model ",
    "it is used to motivate estimates of the abundance of nonlinear objects @xcite , a crucial ingredient in methods which describe the growth of nonlinear gravitational clustering @xcite .",
    "it also provides a framework for discussing the environmental dependence of clustering @xcite .",
    "section  [ model ] summarizes what is known from the linear theory of this yukawa - like model , and then shows our estimate of the key , and sometimes subtle , changes to the spherical evolution model .",
    "section  [ sims ] compares this work to the simulations of @xcite .",
    "a final section summarizes .",
    "we begin by considering the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "this can be done by either considering the fluid equations in expanding coordinates , or by considering the conservation of stress - energy @xmath19 .",
    "if we start with a smooth background , add small perturbations , and linearize the resulting equations , we get a second order differential equation for the evolution of the fractional overdensity , @xmath20 that depends on time , scale factor @xmath21 , the hubble parameter @xmath22 , and the potential @xmath23 . in standard gravity",
    ", we would use the poisson equation to set the relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , but here we will assume a modified poisson equation that results in the above potential , equation  ( [ initialpotential ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 it is easier to work with the fourier transform of this equation : @xmath26           \\left(1-\\frac{h_0 ^ 2 \\omega_\\lambda}{h^2 } \\right ) h^2 \\delta_k.\\ ] ] this can be solved relatively easily to determine the linear growth of structure associated with equation  ( [ initialpotential ] ) .",
    "cdm , at @xmath27 , when @xmath28  mpc and @xmath29 ( top ) and @xmath30 ( bottom ) .",
    "dashed lines show this ratio for the model in equation  ( [ initialpotential ] ) , and solid lines for equation  ( [ potentialeq ] ) . for the solid lines , @xmath31  mpc , and dotted @xmath32  mpc.,title=\"fig : \" ] cdm , at @xmath27 , when @xmath28  mpc and @xmath29 ( top ) and @xmath30 ( bottom ) .",

    "note in particular that @xmath33 , whereas the standard model has no @xmath0 dependence in the growth factor @xmath34 .",
    "the figure shows the effects that one expects to see , namely that for negative @xmath5 the growth factor is smaller at small @xmath0 ( large scales ) , whereas for positive @xmath5 the growth factor is larger at large scales .",
    "both have a region where they deviate from being scale independent , until on very large scales they return to scale independence , though with a different value than in general relativity .",
    "while this is not a significant problem for linear theory , we decided to explicitly force the potential back to normal gravity at large scales for reasons which will become clear in the next section , briefly , because we want to assume that the cosmological model is indistinguishable from @xmath3cdm , on the largest scales we want gravity to be the same as in @xmath3cdm .",
    "the potential we are using from this point onward is : @xmath35 with this potential , the @xmath36 term serves to make explicit the return to normal gravity at large scales .",
    "the linear theory equation becomes @xmath37 \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad \\times \\left(1-\\frac{h_0 ^ 2 \\omega_\\lambda}{h^2 } \\right ) h^2 \\delta_k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the linear growth associated with this solution is shown as the solid lines in figure  [ fig : linear ] , when @xmath31  mpc .",
    "the dotted line shows what happens if @xmath32  mpc  a scale which is large compared to that probed by baos .",
    "although the analysis which follows uses @xmath31  mpc , the results which follow are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "excursion set methods @xcite are used to estimate the number density of collapsed haloes , the merger rates of haloes , the conditional mass function of progenitors as a function of final halo mass and time , and the nonlinear counts - in - cells distribution , all of which help us to link what we observe about the properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters with cosmology .",
    "essentially , excursion set methods relate the properties of halos today to the initial density fluctuation field .",
    "an advantage of such methods is that we only need a few things in order to use them : one is an assumption that the initial fluctuations are small and gaussian , the other is a model for determining how dense something must have been initially to collapse at a given time .",
    "the first is given to us by wmap , the second is more difficult .",
    "a simple model for how to determine this critical density is given by the spherical evolution model , in which one considers a spherical tophat perturbation in the initial density fluctuation field . in the standard model , the gravitational evolution of such a patch",
    "is determined only by the mass within it , and so one can determine how overdense such a patch needs to be initially in order to collapse by a given time .",
    "this critical overdensity @xmath38 generically depends on the background cosmology @xcite .",
    "the spherical collapse calculation begins with the statement that the force driving the acceleration is related to the gravitational potential by @xmath39 this can be integrated once to get @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the integral of the potential over the mass distribution , and @xmath42 is the total energy of the patch , which is constant .",
    "in standard gravity , the potential of a shell of mass @xmath43 is the same as that of a point mass at the center of the sphere , so @xmath41 reduces to @xmath44 .",
    "the constant @xmath42 can be related to the initial overdensity and/or expansion rate of the patch : the initial expansion rate is given by the hubble expansion rate of the background in which the patch is embedded , namely in comoving coordinates @xmath45 , so @xmath46 , so @xmath47 . including a cosmological constant presents no conceptual difference .    in standard gravity",
    "one can directly solve this equation .",
    "the solution is a cycloid for which the critical value of the initial overdensity required for collapse , @xmath38 , does not depend on the initial size of the patch .",
    "this scale independence of @xmath38 is a result of birkhoff s theorem : the evolution of a tophat sphere is the same as that given by friedmann s equations , so the actual size of the patch drops out .    when gravity is modified , things are no longer so simple .",
    "for example , when the potential is given by equation  ( [ potentialeq ] ) , birkhoff s theorem no longer applies : a particle offcenter in a uniform spherical shell will feel a force from the shell because we no longer have a @xmath48 force law .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , equation  ( [ f = gradphi ] ) can still be integrated once to get equation  ( [ solveeq ] ) , only now @xmath41 has contributions from both the internal and external mass distributions .",
    "we can get @xmath49 by integrating equation  ( [ potentialeq ] ) of the mass distribution , leaving @xmath42 and the initial value for @xmath50 to be determined .",
    "as before , @xmath42 is the total energy ( constant in time ) , and we set @xmath47 .",
    "( this was why we used equation  [ potentialeq ] rather than equation  [ initialpotential ] . )",
    "second , whereas evenly spaced concentric shells remain evenly spaced in the standard tophat model , this is no longer the case when the potential is modified . as a result , the initial tophat perturbation develops a nontrivial density profile as it collapses .    , with @xmath51 ( top ) and @xmath52 ( bottom ) .",
    "the thick solid lines are actually the positions of the shell on the edge of the density perturbation for 3,10 , 20 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 80 , 100 , and 200 shells , note they all lie nearly on top of each other .",
    "the dashed curves show the evolution when @xmath53 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , with @xmath51 ( top ) and @xmath52 ( bottom ) .",
    "the thick solid lines are actually the positions of the shell on the edge of the density perturbation for 3,10 , 20 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 80 , 100 , and 200 shells , note they all lie nearly on top of each other .",
    "the dashed curves show the evolution when @xmath53 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    of course , neither of these changes prevent us from solving for the evolution of @xmath54 .",
    "our main interest in what follows is not in the details of how the density profile is modified ( this is interesting in its own right ) , but in the modification to the critical density required for collapse . to estimate this in practice ,",
    "two things require care , both of which are related to the breakdown of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "the first is that , because the shape of the perturbation evolves , one must follow the evolution not just of a shell at the boundary of the perturbation , but of a series of concentric shells .",
    "so the question is : how finely spaced must the shells be before one converges to the correct solution ?",
    "the second is that one now cares not only about the mass initially interior to the initial boundary , but the mass exterior as well . in this case",
    ", the question is : how far beyond the initial boundary of the perturbation matters before one reaches convergence ?    therefore we start with an initial patch which is substantially larger than that within which there is an initial overdensity , and use a simple 1-dimensional n - body simulation to solve for @xmath54 .",
    "we found that volumes having twice the initial comoving radius or larger were sufficient to account for the lack of birkhoff s theorem , regardless of @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "we also found that for objects of mass up to @xmath55 , using 3 ( linearly spaced ) wide shells provided a @xmath38 that was within 1% of 200 shells ( see figure  [ fig : denplot ] ) .",
    "for higher mass objects we found that we needed more than 3 shells , but by 40 shells @xmath38 is within 0.02% of @xmath38 calculated with 200 shells .",
    "cdm , @xmath28 mpc and @xmath31 mpc . from top to bottom , curves show models in which @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( note that @xmath53 is standard gravity ) . ]    having determined that our numerical solution had converged , we evaluated @xmath54 at the present time in an @xmath3cdm background model , for a grid of initial sizes and overdensities . by finding which pairs of initial density and size @xmath58 when evolved result in @xmath59 , we obtained @xmath60 .",
    "since the initial overdensity is always small , we can use the fact that @xmath61 to express this critical density as a function of mass rather than initial radius .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : barriershapes ] .",
    "notice that @xmath38 depends on mass ; this is not unexpected , because patches which remain smaller than @xmath6 throughout their evolution ( and become small mass halos ) are unlikely to notice any modification , whereas those which are larger than @xmath6 at any time during their evolution will .",
    "this mass - dependence of @xmath38 means that we expect to see a variation in cluster abundances only at masses larger than @xmath62 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath63  mpc , for which the mass scale is about @xmath64 .",
    "( for fixed @xmath5 , the mass scale is proportional to @xmath65 . )    , as a function of mass @xmath66 for models with @xmath29 ( short dashed ) and @xmath30 ( long dashed ) , the solid line is for @xmath53 .",
    "the rapid rise of the negative @xmath5 barrier in figure  [ fig : barriershapes ] is why there is a larger effect on the abundance of high mass halos for negative @xmath5 than positive @xmath5 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : barriershapes ] shows that , when the potential is modified , then @xmath38 is no longer scale - independent .",
    "because it depends on mass , the relevant excursion set problem is one with a ` moving ' rather than ` constant ' barrier , so it is of the type first studied by @xcite . figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows the result of using this formalism to estimate the abundance of virialized objects .",
    "briefly , making this estimate requires that one generate an ensemble of random walks in the @xmath67 plane , where @xmath68 is the variance in the initial fluctuation field when smoothed on scale @xmath58 . since @xmath69 is a monotonic function of @xmath43 , the variables @xmath70 , @xmath43 and @xmath58 are essentially equivalent to one another . in particular , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "one then finds the first crossing distribution @xmath73 of the ` barrier ' @xmath74 .",
    "the abundance of objects is @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows that the abundance of massive objects increases as @xmath5 increases , whereas the abundance of low mass objects is essentially unchanged from when @xmath53 .",
    "we argued above that this makes intuitive sense : the lower mass objects do not feel the change in gravity because they were smaller than @xmath6 throughout their evolution ; the more massive objects are able to become even more massive if @xmath5 is positive , since then gravity is stronger .      before moving on ,",
    "it is worth noting that we were careful to describe and implement the excursion set approach in initial rather than linearly evolved variables . in standard gravity ( @xmath53 ) , it is more common to phrase the discussion in terms of linearly evolved variables .",
    "since the linear growth factor is independent of @xmath0 when @xmath53 , this is straightforward .",
    "however , this is no longer the case when @xmath76 , because of the @xmath0-dependence in @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , the barrier shape in figure  [ fig : barriershapes ] is qualitatively like that of the linear growth factor in figure  [ fig : linear ] , so one might ask if the difference that we see in the mass function is entirely a consequence of the @xmath0-dependence of the linear growth factor . more specifically , the differences shown in figure  [ fig : comparison ] are really a consequence of two effects : first , we have assumed that @xmath78 is the same for all @xmath5 . therefore , @xmath79 is not : the linear theory evolution when @xmath80 results in more large scale power than when @xmath81 , so the rms fluctuation in the present day fields are different  in the jargon , @xmath82 at @xmath83 is larger for the @xmath80 models . since we know that , in standard gravity , the abundance of massive halos is exponentially sensitive to @xmath82",
    ", one might wonder if this alone accounts for much of the effect .",
    "( later on , we will discuss another consequence of normalizing the models at the initial rather than final time . ) to quantify this , we would like to compare the predicted abundances when the models are normalized so that @xmath79 , rather than @xmath78 , is the same .",

    "i.e. , @xmath87 the resulting first crossing distribution @xmath88 is the same as in standard gravity ( after all the barrier is constant ) , but when expressed as a function of mass @xmath43 , the abundances are different because the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath43 depends on @xmath90 .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig : comparisonlinear ] shows that this method yields a mass function that also differs substantially from the standard one : it drops substantially below unity for large @xmath43 . in this case , however , the drop is entirely due to the @xmath0-dependent growth factor .",
    "in addition , notice that although it is qualitatively like the solid line , for which @xmath38 is mass dependent , it can be substantially different ( i.e. , the ratio of the solid to the dashed line is greater than unity ) at large @xmath43 .",
    "this shows that there is more to the change in the mass function than simply the change in the relation between @xmath91 and mass .    whereas the solid line shows results in which the initial power spectra are the same for all @xmath5 ( i.e.",

    "the fact that none of the curves shown in figure  [ fig : comparisonlinear ] are unity for all @xmath43 , nor are any two curves the same , means that cluster abundances in modified gravity models can not be mimicked in standard gravity simply by changing the shape of the initial power spectrum so that it agrees with modified linear theory at @xmath83 .",

    "the filled triangles in figure  [ fig : nmod ] show the result of selecting the most massive halos in the @xmath76 runs and plotting the number of particles they contain versus the number of particles they contained in the @xmath53 run .",
    "the open squares show the result of making the selection in the @xmath53 run .",
    "the top and bottom panels show results for @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "this illustrates that with stronger gravity ( larger @xmath5 ) , a given halo is more likely to become more massive , but this only matters for halos more massive than about @xmath105 .",
    "we presented a study of nonlinear effects in a model with a modified gravitational potential ( equation  [ potentialeq ] ) .",
    "in particular , we showed how the spherical evolution model is modified , and the effect this has on the abundance of virialized objects .",
    "halos are more massive in models where gravity is stronger on large scales ( figure  [ fig : nmod ] ) , although this effect is only important for sufficiently massive objects whose evolution brings them close to the scale @xmath6 on which gravity was modified .",
    "the effect this has on the abundance of massive objects depends on how the models are normalized .",
    "if normalized so that the fluctuation field is the same at early - times ( cmb - normalized ) , then the models with @xmath80 have more massive halos ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisonlinear ] differ from unity ) .",
    "this remains true , although the dependence on @xmath5 is reduced , if the models are normalized to have the same ( @xmath5-dependent ) linear theory rms fluctuations today ( compare solid and dashed curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : comparisonlinear ] ) . if normalized to have the same ( linear theory ) rms fluctuations today , whatever the value of @xmath5 , then the trends can be reversed ( compare dotted curves with unity in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisonlinear ] ) .",
    "this last normalization convention is sometimes known as ` cluster - normalized ' : our work suggests that , in the context of modified gravity models , this jargon is misleading !",
    "we showed that our analysis captures the essence of the trends seen in the simulations ( figure  [ fig : compareall ] ) , so , in principle , the abundance of rich clusters should place interesting constraints on modifications to the gravitational potential . in particular , the modification to cluster abundances can not be reproduced by standard gravity with initial conditions modified to match the change in the linear theory power spectrum ; the differences in abundance can be larger than ten percent for sufficiently massive halos ( figure  [ fig : comparisonlinear ] ) .",
    "however , to use cluster counts quantitatively in this way , our analysis should be extended to models in which objects form from an ellipsoidal collapse , as was necessary for standard gravity @xcite .",
    "our analysis also helps to understand an interesting fact about the shape of the nonlinear power spectrum in modified gravity theories .",
    "figure  7 in @xcite shows that whereas the large scale power spectrum in modified theories may be rather different than in standard gravity ( because the linear growth factor is modified ) , the power on small scales ( @xmath106 ) is unchanged .",
    "our analysis shows that , because small mass objects were never larger than the scale @xmath6 on which gravity was modified , they are not affected by the modification , so their abundance is the same as in the standard case .",
    "this is not affected by the initial conditions that we choose so that in both when @xmath5 is non - zero , and when the power spectrum is changed so that we end up with a final power spectrum the same as in the case of modified gravity , the abundances of small halos is unaffected .",
    "in addition , their formation histories will also be unchanged , so their internal structural parameters ( shapes , density profiles ) are also unchanged . in the halo model description of large scale structure @xcite ,",
    "the power at @xmath106 is dominated by small mass halos .",
    "since these are the ones for which gravity is essentially unmodified , the small - scale power spectrum is also unchanged .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the result of a complementary study . in this case",
    ", we selected a massive halo from one of the simulations ( say @xmath51 ) , and then looked at where its particles were in the other runs ( with different @xmath5 ) .",
    "the figure illustrates clearly that when @xmath51 , then the particle distribution is more compact .",
    "e.g. , in the top panel , the large halo in the @xmath51 run is broken up into three smaller haloes in the @xmath103 run .",
    "the bottom panel shows another effect : that the particles which made up a halo in the @xmath30 run are in a different location in the @xmath51 run , suggesting that the peculiar velocities of the most massive halos are also sensitive to @xmath5 .",
    "the sequence of contours associated with the different @xmath5 runs look rather similar to the time evolution of an object in , say , an @xmath53 model .",
    "thus , the most massive halos in models with @xmath107 may be like high - redshift versions of the most massive halos in models with @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , these figures suggest that the galaxy populations in massive clusters may be rather different in models with large @xmath5 than when @xmath5 is small . in particular , it is likely that the difference between the cluster and field galaxy populations increases as the strength of gravity on large scales increases .",
    "this is largely a consequence of the different @xmath82 values in these runs  so cluster @xmath108 ratios , currently used to to constrain @xmath82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may one day be used to constrain modifications to gravity .",
    "furthermore , in standard gravity models , there is a strong correlation between evolution and environment @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons to suspect that this will be different if the gravitational potential is modified .",
    "first , in the standard model , the correlation between local environment and evolution is a consequence of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "birkhoff s theorem is lost when the force law is modified ( it is this which modified our spherical evolution model from the standard case ) . and",
    "second , figure  [ fig : contours ] shows that the time scale for the assembly of objects is modified .",
    "the environmental dependence of galaxy properties is in rather good agreement with the standard model @xcite , so it may be that this will one day provide interesting constraints on @xmath5 .",
    "this is the subject of work in progress . in standard gravity",
    ", the formation and abundance of voids can be estimated using similar methods to those used for clusters @xcite  extending our analysis of the modified potential to voids is also work in progress .",
