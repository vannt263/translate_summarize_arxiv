    "by following the stellar dynamics at the center of our galaxy , we have now the most well - established evidence for the existence of a smbh .",
    "the close examination of the keplerian orbits of the so - called s - stars ( also called s0-stars , where the letter `` s '' stands simply for source ) has revealed the nature of the central dark object located at the galactic center . by following s2 ( s02 ) ,",
    "the mass of sgra@xmath2 was estimated to be about @xmath3 within a volume with radius no larger than 6.25 light - hours @xcite . more recent data based on 16 years of observations set the mass of the central smbh to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "massive black holes in a lower range of masses may exist in smaller stellar systems such as globular clusters .",
    "these are called intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) because their masses range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , assuming that they follow the observed correlations between smbhs and their host stellar environments .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of imbhs has never been confirmed , though we have some evidence that could favor their existence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if we wanted to apply the same technique to detect imbhs in globular clusters as we use for smbhs in galactic centers , we would need ultra - precise astronomy , since the sphere of influence of an imbh is @xmath7 few arc seconds .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath8 imbh , the influence radius is of @xmath9 assuming a central velocity dispersion of @xmath10 and a distance of @xmath11 kpc .",
    "the number of stars enclosed in that volume is only a few .",
    "currently , with adaptive optics , one can aspire optimistically to have a couple of measurements of velocities if the target is about @xmath11 kpc away on a time scale of about 10 yrs .",
    "the measures depend on a number of factors , such as the required availability of a bright reference star in order to have a good astrometric reference system . also , the sensitivity limits correspond to a k - band magnitude of @xmath7 15 , ( b- ms stars at 8 kpc , like e.g. s2 in our galactic center ) .",
    "this means that , in order to detect an imbh or , at least , a massive dark object in a globular cluster center by following the stellar dynamics around it , one has to have recourse to the very large telescope interferometer and to one of the next - generation instruments , the vsi or gravity @xcite . in this case",
    "we can hope to improve the astrometric accuracy by a factor of @xmath12 . only in that scenario",
    "would we be in the position of following closely the kinematics around a potential imbh so as to determine its mass .",
    "gw astronomy could contribute to imbh detection . in the past years",
    ", the field has reached a milestone with the construction of an international network of gw interferometers that have achieved or are close to achieving their design sensitivity . moreover",
    ", the first - generation ground - based detectors ligo and virgo will undergo major technical upgrades in the next five years that will increase the volume of the observable universe by a factor of a thousand.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    the data that will be taken by the advanced interferometers are expected to transform the field from gw detection to gw astrophysics .",
    "the availability of accurate waveform models for the full bbh coalescence in order to construct templates for match - filtering is crucial in the gw searches for compact binaries .",
    "the construction of this kind of templates has recently been made possible thanks to the combination of post - newtonian calculations of the bbh inspiral and numerical relativity simulations of the merger and ringdown .",
    "two approaches to this problem are the effective - one - body techniques  @xcite and the phenomenological matching of pn and nr results  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the results of the latter .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : astro ] we expand the astrophysical context to this problem and give a description of the different efforts made to address the evolution of a bbh in a stellar cluster from its birth to its final coalescence . in section  [ sec : wfmodel ]",
    "we introduce the techniques used in the data analysis of the waveform modeling of bbh coalescences , present our hybrid waveform model , and use the model to compute and discuss expected signal - to - noise ratios in present and future gw detectors .",
    "the use of the new waveform model allows us to give an improved estimate for the number of events one can expect for several physical configurations in advanced ligo and the einstein telescope , which we present in section  [ sec : events ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and future prospects of our work in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the aim of this section is not to give a detailed explanation of the processes of formation of imbhs and bbhs , but a general introduction of the two different scenarios that play a role in the formation of bbhs .      up to now",
    ", the imbh formation process which has drawn the most attention is that of a young cluster in which the most massive stars sink down to the center due to mass segregation .",
    "there , a high - density stellar region builds and stars start to physically collide .",
    "one of them gains more and more mass and forms a runaway star whose mass is much larger than that of any other star in the system , a very massive star ( vms ) .",
    "later , that runaway star may collapse and form an imbh @xcite .    in particular , @xcite described in detail the requirements from the point of view of the host cluster to form an imbh in the center of such a system",
    ". the cluster can not have `` too hard '' binaries , the time to reach core - collapse must be shorter than 3  myr and the environmental velocity dispersion can not be much larger than @xmath13 . under these conditions",
    "the authors find that the mass of the vms formed is @xmath14 .",
    "the later evolution of the vms is not well understood , nor are the necessary conditions that it not evolve into a super - massive star ( sms ) ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references in their work ) in this particular scenario , nor are the factors that could limit the mass of such an object such that it not collapse into an imbh .",
    "the process depends on a number of factors and assumptions , such as e.g. the role of metallicity , winds ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * though it is rather unclear how to extrapolate the results they obtain , which are limited to stars with masses of maximum @xmath15 to the masses found in the runaway scenario , which are typically at least one order of magnitude larger ) and the collisions on to the runaway star from a certain mass upwards . on the other hand , @xcite investigated the growth of a runaway particle by coupling direct @xmath16body simulations with smooth particle hydrodynamics , ( sph ) analyzed the evolution of the star and found that stellar winds would not inhibit the formation of a very massive star .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered the effects of stellar evolution on the runaway collision product by analyzing the succession of collisions from a dynamical evolution .",
    "for their low - metallicity models , the final remnant of the merger tree is expected to explode as a supernova , and in their high - metallicity models the possibility of forming an imbh is negligible , finishing with a mass of 1014 @xmath17 at the onset of carbon burning . but as a matter of fact , these stars develop an extended envelope , so that the probability of further collisions is higher .",
    "@xcite did not change the masses in the dynamical simulation accordingly . in any case ,",
    "self - consistent direct - summation @xmath18-body simulations with evolution of the runaway process are called in to investigate the final outcome .",
    "henceforth we will assume that imbhs do form ; in that case , the formation of a binary of them ( bbh ) in a cluster can be theoretically explained in two different ways .    _",
    "( i ) the double - cluster channel : _    in this scenario , two clusters born in a cluster of clusters such as those found in the antenn galaxy are gravitationally bound and doomed to collide ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed explanation of the process and their references ) .",
    "when this happens , the imbhs sink down to the center of the resulting merged stellar system due to dynamical friction .",
    "they form a bbh whose semi - major axis continues to shrink due to slingshot ejections of stars coming from the stellar system . in each of the processes",
    ", a star removes a small fraction of the energy and angular momentum of the bbh , which becomes harder . at later stages in the evolution of the bbh",
    ", gw radiation takes over efficiently and the orbit starts to circularize , though one can expect these systems to have a residual eccentricity when entering the lisa band @xcite .",
    "this detector will typically be able to see systems of binaries of imbhs out to a few gpc .",
    "for this channel and volume , the authors estimated an event rate of @xmath19 .    _",
    "( ii ) the single - cluster channel : _    @xcite added a fraction of primordial binaries to the initial configuration in the scenario of formation of a runaway star in a stellar cluster . in their simulations",
    "they find that not one , but two very massive stars form in rich clusters with a binary fraction of 10% .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of emission of gws by such a bbh and estimated that lisa and advanced ligo can detect tens of them depending on the distribution of cluster masses and their densities .",
    "more recently , @xcite recalculated the rate of @xcite for the case of the proposed einstein telescope could see and quoted a few to a few thousand events of comparable - mass bbh mergers of the single - cluster channel .      in the case of the double - cluster channel , the cluster , which is in rotation",
    ", results from the merger of the two initial clusters and may develop a triaxiality sufficient to produce sufficient centrophilic orbits .",
    "these `` boxy '' orbits , as seen by @xcite , are typical of systems that do not possess symmetry around any of their axes .",
    "in contrast to loop orbits , a characteristic of spherically symmetric or axisymmetric systems , `` boxy '' orbits bring stars arbitrarily close to the center of the system , since it oscillates independently along the three different axes .",
    "therefore , such stars , due to the fact of being potential sling - shots , can feed the process of shrinkage of the bbh semi - major axes by removing energy and angular momentum from it after a strong interaction . in the strong triaxial systems of @xcite ,",
    "the rotation caused in the process of merger creates an unstable structure in the form of a bar . within the bar the angular momentum",
    "will not be conserved and thus the bbh loss - cone is full due to stars on centrophilic orbits , independently of the number of stars @xmath20 . on the other hand , for bbh systems in clusters , the role of brownian motion has an impact in the loss - cone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the models of @xcite ,",
    "the initial conditions are a realistic parabolic merger of two stellar clusters .",
    "the resulting merged cluster does not show the strong axisymmetry of @xcite . in the simulations we address for the results of this work",
    ", the bbh ( of imbhs ) is not stalling , in spite of the reduced number of centrophilic orbits due to the architecture of the stellar system .    in figure  [ fig.evoltriax0p10p8 ]",
    "we show the role of the cluster symmetry explicitly by depicting the evolution of the triaxiality of the cluster formed as a result of the merger of the two clusters for our fiducial model in the case of the double - cluster channel ( which is the reference model of * ? ? ?",
    "after a merger which is the result of a parabolic orbit , the final system is oblate rather than prolate ; i.e. @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cluster axes . at the outskirts",
    "the resulting merged cluster is flatter and at the center the binary of imbhs makes it rather spherical .",
    "@xcite addressed the single - cluster channel scenario after the formation of the imbhs and used additional simulations to further evolve the bbh .",
    "they used scattering experiments of three bodies including relativistic precession to 1st post - newtonian order , as well as radiation reaction caused by gw , so that they did not have to integrate every single star in the cluster to understand the posterior evolution of the bbh . in their work , between the strong encounters , @xmath22 and @xmath25 of the bbh",
    "were evolved by resorting to the quadrupolar formul of @xcite .",
    "the bbh will have completely circularized when it reaches the frequencies probed by advanced ligo and the et , because the emission of gws takes over the dynamics of the system .      while the emission of gws is present all the time from the very first moment in which the bbh is formed , the amplitude and frequency of the waves is initially so low that no present or planned detector would be able to register any information from the system .",
    "only when the semi - major axis shrinks sufficiently does the frequency increase enough to `` enter '' the lisa band , which we assume starts at @xmath26 hz .",
    "the bbh then crosses the entire detector window during its inspiral phase , as we can see in figure  [ fig.lisa ] .",
    "we depict the evolution of a bbh of mass @xmath27 .",
    "the reason for this particular choice of masses is to give the reader a point of reference to understand the whole picture .",
    "recently @xcite included the effect of the rotation of the host cluster and addressed the dynamical evolution of the global system with a bbh of that mass .",
    "the authors have shown that lisa will see the system of figure  [ fig.lisa ] with a median snr of few tens .",
    "the fact that the system merges outside its band prevents lisa from observing the loudest part of the bbh coalescence . in order to follow the system at this early stage of its evolution _ in the lisa band _ , a simple post - newtonian approach suffices for modeling the gw radiation .",
    "we are far enough from the highly relativistic regime and only the inspiral phase of the bbh coalescence is visible to the space antenna , with a rather low snr compared to the posterior phases in the evolution of the bbh .    as the binary system depicted in figure  [ fig.lisa ]",
    "leaves the lisa band and enters the strong field regime , higher order post - newtonian corrections and eventually input from numerical relativity simulations need to be considered in order to model the gw waveform .",
    "three reference frequencies in the evolution of a compact bbh that approaches its merger are the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath28 ) of a test particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , the light - ring frequency ( @xmath29 ) corresponding to the smallest unstable orbit of a photon orbiting a kerr black hole and the fundamental ringdown frequency ( @xmath30 ) of the decay of the quasi - normal modes computed by @xcite .    for the binary system shown in figure  [ fig.lisa ] ,",
    "the values of these three frequencies are @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "should such a binary exist at a distance of 100  mpc ( the choice for this number is based solely on the fact that is is easily scalable ) , and if it were to be detected with advanced ligo , it should produce a sky - averaged snr of @xmath34 , assuming a low frequency cut - off of 10  hz . to that total snr ,",
    "the contribution of parts of the inspiral happening before the system reaches the characteristic frequencies @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 would be 0% , 37% and 95% respectively . figure  [ fig.percsnr ] illustrates the same percentages for binaries with total masses between 100 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is immediately noticed that for the binaries of imbhs of interest to this study , most of the snr that these binaries will produce in advanced ligo comes from the last stages of the bbh coalescence .",
    "we can estimate the time that the binary system takes to evolve from @xmath36 , a frequency where the bbh can be seen by lisa , to the lower cut - off frequency of 10  hz of advanced ligo or of 1  hz of the et . a lower order approximation based on the newtonian quadrupole formula",
    "@xcite leads to the following expression for the evolution of the frequency in terms of the chirp mass @xmath37 and frequency of the system    @xmath38    we find a delay of only 0.2 yrs ( 80 days ) for a bbh with total mass @xmath39 to go from 0.01 hz to the beginning of the advanced ligo band and almost similar numbers to the beginning of the et band ( the evolution of the system is extraordinarily quick in the late inspiral phase , which explains the fast evolution from 1 to 10  hz ) . in view of these figures ,",
    "lisa could be used as an `` alarm '' to prepare ground - based detectors to register the final coalescence in detail , the death of the bbh as such , by adjusting their _ sweet spots _ ( the most sensitive part of the detector ) to the particular bbh .",
    "the high accuracy of parameter estimation during the inspiral phase of which lisa is capable could be combined with the information obtained from the large - snr triggers that the bbh merger and ringdown will produce in advanced ligo or et and thereby achieve a more complete characterization of the system .",
    "accurate theoretical modeling of the gravitational radiation @xmath40 emitted by a bbh is key to improving bbh detectability and parameter estimation . while post - newtonian ( pn ) theory is valid to model the early inspiral phase of the bbh evolution in the lisa band , an exact description of the merger and ringdown stages is only possible via numerical relativity ( nr ) calculations .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to match pn and nr in order to obtain a full waveform for the entire coalescence , most notably for non - spinning configurations in  @xcite and recently introducing spins for non - precessing configurations in  @xcite .    for the purpose of the snr and horizon distance calculations shown in this paper ,",
    "we have chosen a new procedure for the construction of hybrid pn - nr waveforms in the frequency domain proposed by  @xcite .",
    "the construction procedure developed for matching pn and nr data is sketched in figure  [ fig : hybconstr ] ; further details on the fitting procedure can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the model consists of a phenomenological fit to hybrid pn+nr waveforms for spinning , non - precessing bbh systems with comparable masses ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the simulations of @xcite , which find pairs of vmss with mass ratios close to 1 .",
    "the phenomenological waveforms are parameterized by three physical parameters : the total mass of the binary @xmath42 , the symmetric mass ratio @xmath43 and the spin parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the spin angular momentum of the @xmath48th black hole .",
    "only the dominant mode @xmath49 of the gravitational radiation enters in the model ; the effects of the higher modes , which become increasingly significant as @xmath43 decreases , are neglected . for comparable - mass scenarios , this restriction does not substantially affect our results .",
    "the waveform model used in our calculations is valid for binary systems with _ aligned _ spins only , which represents a first step towards the incorporation of the spins of the bhs in full inspiral - merger - ringdown ( imr ) models .",
    "a discussion including precessing systems with arbitrary spins to this date still requires work regarding availability of nr simulations and development appropriate techniques to match precessing merger data with pn .",
    "work in this regard is ongoing .    for the results presented in this article we choose to focus on three configurations : ( i ) equal - mass , non - spinning , ( ii ) equal - mass , equal - value spins aligned with the direction of the total angular momentum and magnitude @xmath50 and ( iii ) mass ratio @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , non - spinning .",
    "provided with the full imr waveforms given by our model , we are interested in assessing the detectability of these systems by current and future gw observatories .",
    "the snr of a model waveform with respect to the output stream of the detector is the quantity typically quoted to signify the detectability of a signal .",
    "the snr @xmath53 produced by a gw signal @xmath40 in a detector can be computed as ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the fourier transform of the strain @xmath40 . in the last equation @xmath56 represents the one - sided noise spectral density of the detector .    figure",
    "[ fig : sfvsh ] provides a graphical representation of the detectability of several bbhs by current and future generations of ground - based gw detectors .",
    "displayed are the design sensitivity of current initial ligo and virgo ( sensitivities that have been met or approximately met during the s5/vsr1 data taking ) , the proposed noise curves of advanced virgo and two possible configurations of advanced ligo ( broadband or `` base '' and optimized for @xmath57 bbhs ) and the designed noise budget for the einstein telescope in its broadband , `` base '' and `` xylophone ''  @xcite configurations .",
    "the hybrid waveforms constructed according to the model of fig .",
    "[ fig : hybconstr ] for the three chosen configurations has been conveniently scaled to represent bbh systems with total mass @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    as the right - hand - side of equation  [ eq : snrdef ] suggests , plotting the quantity @xmath60 versus @xmath61 allows for direct visual comparison of the importance of each of the stages of the bbh coalescence .",
    "the three frequencies @xmath62 and the lorentzian ringdown frequency @xmath63 are marked on top of the configuration ( i ) waveforms with solid circles , squares and open squares respectively .",
    "one can immediately appreciate that systems with total mass above @xmath64 fall almost completely below the 40  hz `` seismic wall '' of the initial ligo detectors ; however they will become very interesting sources for the second generation of gw interferometers and the proposed einstein telescope .",
    "indeed , as we show in section  [ sec : astro ] , they will also be seen by the future space - borne lisa .",
    "additionally it is easy to appreciate why the hang - up configuration ( iii ) will produce larger snrs and therefore will be seen to further distances , for it merges at higher frequencies with respect to a non - spinning configuration with the same @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , for equal spin values , the snr decreases with smaller symmetric mass ratios ( compare configurations ( i ) and ( iii ) ) .    in figure  [",
    "fig : snrall ] we compute the snr expected for these sources in each of the above - mentioned detectors as a function of the redshifted total mass of the system @xmath65 , for optimally - oriented and -located sources at a distance of 6.68 gpc ( z=1 ) .",
    "we have cross - checked our snr results with those computed by  @xcite for initial ligo at 100 mpc , obtaining snr values within 1% of those quoted by them .",
    "a direct comparison with  @xcite shows a disagreement of @xmath66 in the computed snrs for advanced ligo and the et , which might be attributed to the different waveforms and cosmological model used .",
    "unsurprisingly , the snrs calculated for the third generation of ground - based detectors surpass the expectations for initial and advanced virgo and ligo at all masses . at @xmath67 , snrs of the order of 0.1 are expected for current ligo and virgo interferometers for binaries with total mass up to a few hundred @xmath68 .",
    "these values would scale to snrs of @xmath69 at the closer distances typically surveyed by the initial interferometers , which are of the order of tens to few hundreds of mpc .",
    "signals with single - interferometer snrs below the commonly - used threshold of snr=5.5 are most likely to be missed , therefore imbh binary coalescences are of limited interest for the first - generation detectors and even for their current , _ enhanced _",
    "counterparts , which are in turn most sensitive to neutron star binaries and stellar - mass back hole binaries .",
    "advanced ligo and virgo will be able to measure averaged snrs of the order of @xmath70 at @xmath67 , with a maximal response to bbh systems with total mass in the range of 300 to @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , should binaries of imbhs exist in our neighboring universe , the second - generation of gw interferometers should be able to detect them , for they will be loud enough to stand above the detector noise . as we will see later",
    ", the non - negligible imbh binary coalescence rate for advanced ligo indicates that these sources should be taken into account in future match - filtered searchers for inspiral binaries . due to the moderate snr of the signals , a potential detection might be sufficient to confirm the existence of binaries of imbhs but not enough to determine all its parameters , such as mass ratio and spins , with sufficient accuracy ; for the advanced detectors , @xcite estimate an accuracy of @xmath72 in the reduced mass @xmath73 using pn templates with negligible spins at snr@xmath12 .",
    "when they take the spins into account , @xmath74 increases by @xmath75 .",
    "it is expected that the use of full imr templates will improve these figures , but the final accuracy will always be limited by the slightly - above - threshold snrs expected in advanced ligo and virgo .",
    "the einstein telescope will instead measure snr values within the @xmath76 range at @xmath77 , and it is expected to be sensitive to binaries with total masses of the order of @xmath8 , a significantly larger range than that surveyed by advanced ligo and virgo .",
    "it is noticeable how the et xylophone configuration increases the detectability of binaries with masses above @xmath78 with respect to the broadband et configuration .",
    "this is due to its improved sensitivity precisely at frequencies in the range of @xmath79  hz , which is where systems of mass above thousands of solar masses accumulate most of their snr ( see figure  [ fig : sfvsh ] ) .",
    "the large - snr events that binaries of imbhs would produce in the et are of great importance for astrophysics ; the reason being that as the snr increases , the accuracy in parameter estimation also does . in the limit of large snr ,",
    "the inverse of the fisher information matrix @xmath80 is an estimator of the errors in the recovered parameters . at the relative large snrs potentially produced by imbh binaries in the et",
    ", the possibility of extracting their mass ratios and spins to high accuracies would be revolutionary for characterizing the imbhs populations .",
    "as for lisa , bbhs with masses of hundreds of solar masses will be seen with a moderate snr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed study of the parameter extraction ) ",
    "it is only at masses above tens of thousands of solar masses that lisa will start taking over the ground - based observatories .",
    "although the space antenna will be most sensitive to bbh binaries with masses in the range of @xmath81 , the possibility that it can act as a complementary observatory for the einstein telescope for imbh binaries is very promising .",
    "parameter accuracy studies for imbhs in lisa are already available using the inspiral part of the coalescence ( including also non - negligible eccentricities ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicate that masses and sky positions will be recovered with a high accuracy level . in order to complete the characterization of imbhs with the information given by the second and third generations of ground - based detectors , a comprehensive study of parameter recovery taking the bbh coalescence into account is very much desirable .",
    "@xcite estimated for the first time the event rate for _ intermediate - mass _ mergers of imbhs ( i.e. typically stellar black holes merging with imbhs ) in clusters by calculating the luminosity distance for the inspiral , merger and ringdown @xcite out to which these three stages can be detected with an snr larger than 10 . in his approach , the maximum distance for the detector was 3 gpc ( @xmath82 ) , with no cosmological corrections .",
    "the event rate was calculated as @xmath83 . in this equation @xmath84",
    "is the number density of globular clusters , which was taken to be @xmath85 , as in the work of @xcite .",

    "subsequently , @xcite calculated the number of events that initial and advanced ligo ( and lisa ) could see from the single - cluster channel . in their estimation",
    ", they assume that the vmss formed in the runaway scenario do not merge into one , but evolve separately and eventually each form an individual imbh , following the numerical results of the monte carlo experiments of @xcite .",

    "the limit for the integral in @xmath115 is thus given by the observable volume of the detector of interest , quantified using the orientation - averaged distance .",
    "the maximum redshift @xmath116 is in turn a function of the mass of the binary system , its configuration mass ratio , spin and the particular waveform model used in the calculation of the horizon distance .",
    "we present our values for @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmax ] , which essentially shows the same data as fig .  [ fig.hordistplot ] but expressed in terms of redshift versus total mass of the binary . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig.hordistplot ] , the maximum values for the orientation - averaged distance for et are as large as @xmath117 for configuration ( ii ) at @xmath118 .",
    "this implies that the et will be able to probe the different proposed scenarios to produce the first generation of black hole seeds , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , at these large cosmological distances , the stellar formation rate is unknown and the validity of the rate integral can not be stated .",
    "we therefore set a maximum cutoff value of @xmath119 in the computation of eq .",
    "[ eq : integralrates ] .",
    "the final value of @xmath120 that we have used in the computation of the rates is show in figure  [ fig : zmax ] for our three particular physical configurations .",
    "regarding the term in the @xmath121 integral in  [ eq : integralrates ] , three different parameterizations of the sfr are available in the literature , i.e. @xmath122 as summarized by equations 4 , 5 and 6 of  @xcite .",
    "the three models are similar for distances up to @xmath123 , where sfr peaks , differing from there on . for the results shown here ,",
    "we have compared the three of them . as for the distribution of cluster masses ,",
    "the factor can be approximated as    @xmath124    in order to compute the integral in the denominator , we take @xmath125 , following the power law form observed by  @xcite for young star clusters in the antenn .",
    "the validity of assuming the same law for the larger volume of the universe surveyed by advanced ligo or the et is , however , a generalization not based on direct observations .",
    "thus , we should take this premise with care . by assuming an efficiency factor of @xmath126 , based in the results of @xcite",
    ", we can set the values for the limits in @xmath127 according to the masses of the imbh binaries of interest . in our case , taking the standard definition of imbh into account , this is @xmath128 .",
    "the integral can now be expressed as    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the range of total mass of the bbh that we are considering , @xmath131 is any of the three considered stellar formation rates of  @xcite and    @xmath132    is the factor that relates the stellar formation rate function in different cosmologies with respect to the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "regarding the values of the terms @xmath94 and @xmath93 , it is unfortunately very little what we know about the initial cluster conditions required to form an imbh binary .",
    "these factors have therefore large uncertainties . following the existing literature",
    ", we leave the fraction of massive clusters that form imbhs , @xmath94 , as a parameter and set it to @xmath133 as an example . nevertheless , as proven in the simulations of @xcite",
    ", it could be _ as large as @xmath134_. as for the fraction of mass going into massive clusters , @xmath93 , previous works have also tentatively set it to @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless , the results of  @xcite seem to indicate that this value might be too optimistic .",
    "@xcite estimates an empirical cluster formation efficiency by mass of @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the initial globular cluster population and @xmath137 is the initial reservoir available in the protogalaxy .",
    "he then infers a universal value of @xmath138 after evaluating a sample of 97 giant ellipticals , brightest cluster galaxies and faint dwarfs .",
    "he finds identical results for the population ii spheroid of the milky way .",
    "therefore we have chosen to set our @xmath93 to @xmath139 , noting that , in any case , the final rates scale trivially with both @xmath94 and @xmath93 .    we have evaluated the integral  [ eq : integralrates ] for the three stellar formation rates we consider and the three binary configurations ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) for advanced ligo and the et .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tab : eventrates ] .",
    "we find that the event rate does not depend strongly on the assumed stellar formation rate ; the differences are of the order of @xmath140 for advanced ligo and @xmath141 for the et . in the case of advanced ligo , the insensitivity to the stellar formation model is easily explained by the fact that the three models of  @xcite are very similar until @xmath142 ; our integration in @xmath115 stops at @xmath143 ( see red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmax ] ) , therefore ignoring contributions at higher @xmath115 .",
    "for the et , the differences among @xmath131 between @xmath123 and 5 are very much attenuated by the rapid decrease in comoving volume at high redshift . in order to assess the effect of stopping the integration at @xmath144 , we have also computed the rates for the et without imposing this condition . the differences amount to @xmath145",
    ", therefore we conclude that the rates estimations are not very sensitive to very high-@xmath115 sfrs .",
    "nonetheless , we should stress again that the lack of stellar formation data at these large cosmological distances makes assumptions at @xmath146 largely speculative and thus we restrict to presenting the rates calculated with @xmath116 clamped at a value of 5 .",
    "given the inherent uncertainties present in our approach , which can amount to a few orders of magnitude , the factors associated to the choice of sfr do not represent a major source of error .",
    "we therefore quote the results found for @xmath147 only , corresponding to the star formation rate that increases up to @xmath148 and keeps constant afterwards .",
    ".event rates formed in the single - cluster channel for imbh binaries potentially observable by advanced ligo and the et per year .",
    "we take @xmath149 , @xmath150 as standard scaling values[tab : eventrates ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the event rates do , however , strongly depend on the spins and mass ratio of the binary . as expected , `` loud '' configurations like the hang - up case increase the event rate by a factor of @xmath151 in the case of advanced ligo .",
    "this effect is more notable the larger the total spin of the binary is ; the correct determination of the spin distribution of imbh binary systems would be extremely useful to further quantify the impact on the total rates .",
    "smaller mass ratios decrease the event rates , the difference between @xmath152 and @xmath153 being also approximately of a factor of 3 .",
    "the differences are not so extreme in the case of the et , due to the fact that we are cutting off @xmath116 at a value of @xmath154 and , thus , neglecting contributions at higher redshift which might amount to another @xmath155 , as discussed above .",
    "even so , it is evident that the expected rates increase with the total spin @xmath156 and the symmetric mass ratio @xmath43 .",
    "the exact computation of the total rates for all possible physical configurations of the binary would necessitate further integration on the mass ratios and spins of the system .",
    "at present it is not clear what that distribution might be , therefore we simply summarize our results for all configurations under consideration in table  [ tab : eventrates ] .",
    "we find event rates of the order of @xmath157 for advanced ligo and of the order of @xmath158 for the et .",
    "these rates assume formation of imbh binaries in the single - cluster channel .",
    "for advanced ligo and a non - spinning configuration ,  @xcite found a expected detection rate of @xmath159 ( @xmath160 in our units ) , adopting a reach of 2 gpc ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "this estimation , calculated assuming a ringdown - only search , underestimates the volume of the universe that advanced ligo would observe using full imr templates , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.hordistplot ] .",
    "our results for non - spinning systems are compatible with this observation ; we quote rates larger than those of  @xcite by a factor of 3 but otherwise of a compatible order of magnitude . in the case of the et ,",
    "@xcite quote a rate of @xmath162 ( @xmath163 in our units ) for non - spinning configurations , a value of the same order of magnitude than the one found by us .",
    "the fact that  @xcite use a different family of waveforms to model the coalescence and a fitted formula for the the averaged distance based on eobnr waveforms , together with the slightly different values in the integration limits explain the discrepancies in the exact figures .",
    "therefore , our new results for the rates of imbh binary coalescence for non - spinning systems agree reasonably well with previous works that used similar methods but different waveform and detector models . in addition , we have now quantified the effect that the spins of the bhs will have on the expected rates and have found it to be of a factor @xmath151 for total spins of the binary as high as @xmath164    thus far we have concentrated on the single - cluster channel scenario . @xcite",
    "give a prescription to calculate an estimate of the event rates for the double - cluster channel .",
    "this was based in the fact that the only difference , in terms of the event calculation , between both astrophysical scenarios involves , firstly , that in the double - cluster channel there is one single imbh in one cluster and , secondly , that these two clusters must collide so that the imbhs form a bbh when they sink to the center due to dynamical friction . as explained in section 4 of @xcite ,",
    "the connection between the event rate estimation of the two channels is @xmath165    where @xmath166 is the event rate of the double - cluster channel , @xmath167 of the single - channel and @xmath168 is the probability for two clusters to collide in the scenario of @xcite .",
    "they find that the unknown parameter @xmath168 could have values in the range @xmath169 $ ] . the total event rate assuming that both formation channels are possible would be @xmath170 assigning parameter @xmath168 its pessimistic and optimistic limits , we can compute the lower and upper limit of the event rates for advanced ligo and the et , assuming contributions of the two channels . taking into account",
    "the double - cluster channel increases the rates upper limit by a factor of 2 .",
    "for instance , for the equal - mass , non - spinning case , the values are @xmath171\\,\\left(\\frac{g}{0.1}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{g_{\\rm cl}}{1/400}\\right)\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\\\ \\gamma_{\\rm et}^{\\rm total } & \\in [ ( 0)\\,23.7,\\,43.0]\\,\\left(\\frac{g}{0.1}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{g_{\\rm cl}}{1/400}\\right)\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the results are quoted in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath93 ; the already - mentioned uncertainty in their values could increase these rates by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "these event rates are encouraging to address the problem of detection and characterization of systems of imbh binaries with ground - based gw observatories . on the other hand",
    ", one should bear in mind that the existence of imbhs altogether has not yet been corroborated , so that the pessimistic estimate is still somewhat `` optimistic '' .",
    "this is why we have added a @xmath172 in the previous rates as the absolute lower limit .",
    "even though we do not have any evidence of imbhs so far , a number of theoretical works have addressed their formation in dense stellar clusters .",
    "if we were to follow the same techniques that have led us to discover the smbh in our own galaxy , we would need the very large telescope interferometer and next - generation instruments , such as the vsi or gravity , which should be operative in the next @xmath12 yrs . an alternative or even complementary way of discovering imbhs is via their emission of gws when they are in a bbh system .",
    "the identification and characterization of these systems rely on accurate waveform modeling of their gw emission , which has been made possible by the success of numerical relativity in simulating the last orbits of the bbh coalescence and the coupling of these results to analytical post - newtonian calculations of the inspiral phase .",
    "we use a pn - nr hybrid waveform model of the bbh coalescence based on a construction procedure in the frequency domain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "using this hybrid waveform , we have estimated the snr corresponding to the current and advanced ligo and virgo detectors , the proposed et and the space - based lisa at a distance of @xmath67 , i.e. 6.68 gpc .",
    "the results indicate that imbh binaries will produce snrs sufficient for detection in advanced ligo and virgo and notably larger snrs in the et , thus making them interesting sources to follow up on .",
    "eventual observations of imbh binaries with future ground - based detectors could be complementary to those of lisa , which is expected to detect these systems with moderate snrs and to be more sensitive to smbh binaries instead .",
    "more remarkably , in principle , if lisa and the et are operative at the same time , they could complement each other and be used to track a particular event .",
    "furthermore , we have revisited the event rate of bbhs for various detectors and find encouraging results , within the inherent uncertainties of the approach .",
    "our estimations are consistent with previous works , and additionally we have quantified the effect of the total spin of the binary in the expected event rates .",
    "we have estimated the distance to which advanced ligo and the et will be able to see binaries of imbhs .",
    "this quantity depends strongly on the mass ratio and spins of the binary . for advanced ligo , equal - mass , non",
    "- spinning configurations of observed total mass @xmath173@xmath174 can be seen up to @xmath175 . if the spins are aligned with the total angular momentum and significant ( @xmath176 ) , the reach increases to @xmath177 for observed total masses of @xmath178",
    ". the et will be able to explore even more remote distances , reaching to @xmath179 and further .",
    "our present knowledge of stellar formation at such large redshifts is incomplete , therefore we have computed the event rates for the et integrating only until @xmath144 .",
    "we have compared three star formation models and three different configurations of the binary .",
    "the effect of the particular formation model is not very significant ; remarkably , the physical configuration does however influence the final rates .",
    "we provide the results for three physical configurations , taking into account both single- and double - cluster channels in the binary formation . for a fully correct calculation of the event rate integrated over all possible configurations , more detailed knowledge of the distribution of spins and mass ratios of imbh binaries formed in globular cluster",
    "is required .",
    "advanced ground - based detectors are designed to be able to operate in different modes so that their sensitivity can be tuned to various kinds of astrophysical objects .",
    "considering the importance of an eventual detection of a bbh , the design of an optimized advanced ligo configuration for systems with @xmath180 would be desirable to increase the possibility of observing such a system . in case an imbh binary coalescence were detected , the recovery and study of the physical parameters of the system could serve to test general relativity and prove or reject alternative theories , such as scalar - tensor type or massive graviton theories .",
    "direct _ identification of an imbh with gws will be a revolutionary event not only due to the uncertainty that surrounds their existence and their potential role in testing general relativity .",
    "the information encoded in the detection will provide us with a detailed description of the environment of the bbh / imbh itself .",
