    "a lot of exoplanets have been found , and many of them are considered to be gaseous giant planets like jupiter . in particular , some of them orbit very close ( @xmath0au ) to the central stars and they are commonly known as hot jupiters .",
    "transit observations of exoplanets give us not only the information of the radius of a planet and the orbital period , but also the information of atmospheric structure and composition by spectroscopic observations .",
    "for example , the absorption in the h ly@xmath1 line and the nai d line is detected at hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "detection of h ly@xmath1 is also confirmed in other planets , such as hd 198733b @xcite , 55 cnc b @xcite .",
    "the radius of hd 209458b measured in the nai d line is not so different from the apparent radius at other wavelengths , but the radius measured in the h ly@xmath1 line is several times larger than the radius of the planet @xcite .",
    "the surface temperature of hd 209458b is expected to be approximately 750k , but the scale height at this temperature is too small to explain the extended upper atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the observation suggests that the temperature of the extended upper atmosphere is much higher than that of the surface @xcite .",
    "recently transit observations by an x - ray space telescope show that the apparent radius of the hot jupiter in the x - ray is few times larger than the radius of the planet @xcite .",
    "in addition transmission spectra during primary transit and reflectance spectra around secondary eclipse probe the composition and temperature - pressure structures of the atmosphere of exoplanets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , transit observations strongly suggest the existence of mass loss from hot jupiters .",
    "the first detection of mass loss from a hot jupiter is the transit observations of hd 209458b in uv band @xcite .",
    "the high temperature atmosphere of hydrogen atoms that is escaping from the planet is supposed to make a cometary tail - like structure , hence dimming of a central star by escaping atmosphere is observed in uv band , especially in the ly@xmath1 line .",
    "the mass loss rate is estimated by the absorption of the ly@xmath1 line and its value reaches at least @xmath2 @xcite . since this value is model dependent and",
    "not directly observed , an actual value of the mass loss rate is still uncertain .",
    "it is suggested that the mass loss rate can be either larger by several orders of magnitude @xcite , or lower , for example gas trapping by closed magnetic field of the planet(e.g .",
    "the observations of transit by h ly@xmath1 showed that the maximum velocity of the escaping gas is as fast as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the mass loss from a planet because it will strongly affect the evolution of a planet .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism of the strong mass loss from exoplanets is still unknown .",
    "various models on the structure of the upper atmosphere and the mechanism of mass loss have been developed .",
    "for example , energy limited escape by x - ray and extreme ultraviolet irradiation from a central star are proposed @xcite .",
    "this is the mechanism that certain amounts of energy of x - ray and extreme ultraviolet irradiation from the central star heat the upper atmosphere through photodissociation and photoionization , and drives mass loss from the upper atmosphere .",
    "a model that includes x - ray and extreme ultraviolet heating with photochemistry showed the temperature of the upper atmosphere of the irradiated gaseous planets become @xmath4 , and obtained mass loss rate is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "also , several models demonstrate that the velocity of the escaping atmosphere can be supersonic , and hydrodynamic escape dominates over jeans escape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these models that include the heating of x - ray and extreme ultraviolet suggest the mass loss rate from hot jupiters become @xmath6 .",
    "x - ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation is strong in the early evolutionary phase of the central star , therefore hot jupiters may lose the most of their masses by the xuv - driven atmospheric escape in the early phase of a system .",
    "it is possible for a hot jupiter to lose its entire envelope and remain only with the solid core , so the atmospheric escape from hot jupiters may affect the population of the close - in planets @xcite . additionally , several previous works suggest that an effect of radiation pressure of the central star on the escaping atmosphere , and an effect of charge exchange between the escaping atmosphere and the stellar wind are important to explain the observed spectrum features by using three dimensional particle simulation @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields of gaseous planets are thought to be also important for the mass loss rate and the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "recently , several authors studied the effects of the planetary magnetic fields .",
    "for example , magnetically controlled outflows that are launched from polar region of the planets @xcite , and numerical calculations on upper atmospheres of hot jupiters with the magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "they also discuss the effects on the transit depth and the loss rate of the angular momentum by the planetary magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the effects of ohmic dissipation in the atmosphere and internal structure of hot jupiters are also studied@xcite .",
    "however , effects of planetary magnetic field and disturbance at the surface of a planet on a mass loss rate are not investigated previously .",
    "stellar winds from intermediate- and low - mass stars like solar wind , are typical examples of a mechanism of mass loss due to the magnetic field . the origin of the energy that accelerates the solar wind is supposed to be the energy of the magneto - convection and turbulence at the surface .",
    "mass loss by the same driving mechanism at the sun can occur in exoplanets because they are expected to have their own magnetic field and strong convection .",
    "we calculate the mass loss driven by magnetic field from gas giants , especially from hot jupiters by 1d mhd simulations , and analyze the dependence of the mass loss rate and the atmospheric structure on various properties of gaseous planets . as a result",
    ", the amount of magnetically driven wind can be very large , and it can play an important role in the mass loss from gaseous planets .    in section 2",
    "we represent our calculation method . in section 3",
    "we describe the calculation result , especially the dependence of the mass loss rate on the velocity dispersion at the surface of a planet , radius , and mass of a planet . in section 4",
    "we give summary and discussion , where we derive an analytical expression of the dependence between the mass loss rate and parameters , and compare it with numerical simulation .",
    "we also discuss the consistency between numerical results and observations .",
    "in this paper we extend our numerical simulation code for the solar wind @xcite to planetary winds .",
    "the simulation code is generally applicable to stars with a surface convective layer .",
    "so far , we have applied it to red giant winds @xcite and young active solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "hot jupiters generally possess a surface convective layer .",
    "therefore , they are a candidate that our simulation code is directly applicable to . before describing the detailed modeling for the planetary winds ,",
    "we briefly introduce general properties of stellar winds from stars with surface convection and our simulation code .    in stars with a surface convective layer ,",
    "magnetic fields are generated by dynamo action ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and various types of magnetic waves are excited @xcite . among them , alfvn waves are an promising source which transfers the energy in the surface convection to the upper atmosphere ; alfvn waves , which propagate upwardly from the surface , heat up the upper corona and drive the stellar wind by various dissipation processes @xcite .",
    "we time - dependently solve the propagation and dissipation of such mhd waves and consequent heating of the gas in a single open flux tube . in order to take into account closed loops which cover a sizable fraction of the surface , we consider super - radially open magnetic flux tubes of which the radial magnetic field strength , @xmath7 , is determined by the conservation of magnetic flux , @xmath8 where @xmath9 indicates an areal filling factor of open flux tubes at radial distance @xmath10 , and a subscript 0 represents the surface .",
    "we use the same functional form of @xmath9 as in @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes a typical height of closed loops .",
    "this is essentially the same form as a super - radial expansion factor which was introduced by @xcite .    in the 1d open flux tube",

    ". @xmath29 is thermal conductive flux and @xmath30 is radiative cooling , which is explained later . note that the curvature effects appear as @xmath31 terms , instead of @xmath10 for the usual spherical coordinates .",
    "we adopt 2nd - order mhd - godunov - mocct scheme to update the physical quantities @xcite .",
    "also , this calculation method for stellar winds from solar - type stars is developed to 2d calculation , and more detailed aspects of stellar winds have been investigated @xcite .    in the simulations for the solar and stellar winds",
    "@xcite , we set the inner boundary at the photosphere .",
    "for the planetary winds in this paper , we set the inner boundary at the position that gives @xmath32 dyn @xmath33 ( @xmath34 bar ) .",
    "we fix the temperature at the inner boundary to the given surface temperature , @xmath35 .",
    "the density at the inner boundary is accordingly determined to give @xmath36 .    since the strength and the configuration of magnetic field in hot jupiters have large uncertainties , we set up an open magnetic flux tube referring to observation of the sun .",
    "recent observations by the hinode satellite shows that the footpoints of open flux tubes in polar regions are anchored to so - called kg patches @xcite .",
    "the field strength is approximately the equipartition to the gas internal energy .",
    "the magnetic field lines are super - radially open with an elevating altitude and the cross section is typically expands with a factor of 1000 , which indicates that the filling factor of open flux tubes at the photosphere is an order of @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "the typical field strengths in the coronal region are an order of 1 g .",
    "applying these obtained magnetic properties on the sun to planetary winds , we impose the radial magnetic field with the strength being the equipartition value to the gas pressure , or in other words , plasma @xmath38 @xmath39 equals to unity at the inner boundary @xcite . in our setups , the value that satisfies",
    "this condition is @xmath40 kg . the filling factor at the inner boundary is set to be @xmath41 , which indicates that the average field strength contributed from open flux tube regions is @xmath42 g. the filling factor is , in principle , determined by the force balance between the outflowing wind and the magnetic field ; larger wind mass flux opens up closed magnetic structure to lead to larger @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we should carefully examine the obtained wind profile in comparison to the field strength in the outer region .",
    "in typical cases , the alfvn point , the location at which the alfvn velocity equals to the radial flow velocity , is 10 - 20 planetary radii .",
    "this indicates that the wind kinetic energy is comparable to the energy of the radial magnetic field at this location .",
    "the obtained alfvn point in units of the object s radius is quite similar to that for the solar wind , and the adopted @xmath43 is supposed to be reasonable .    as the standard case of our simulations , we take a hot jupiter with the surface temperature , @xmath44 k. we inject velocity perturbations with amplitude , @xmath45 , at the inner boundary , where @xmath46 is sound speed . here",
    ", we assume a broad band spectrum of @xmath47 in proportion to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is frequency . for the standard case",
    ", we adopt the loop height , @xmath50 , which controls the location where the open flux tube most rapidly opens .",
    "when changing the surface temperature , we change @xmath12 in proportion to @xmath35 , because we expect that @xmath12 is scaled by the pressure scale height , which @xmath51 .",
    "we perform simulations of hot jupiters with the solar metallicity and take the radiative cooling ( equation [ eq : eng ] ) from the solar abundance gas . in the simulations for the solar and stellar winds",
    "@xcite , we have taken the optically thin radiative cooling for the coronal plasma @xcite and empirical radiative cooling for the chromospheric gas that takes into account optically thick effects based on observations of the solar chromosphere @xcite .",
    "for the simulations of hot jupiters , we need to prescribe the radiative cooling for gas with lower temperature down to @xmath52 k. in this paper , we adopt a simple treatment by extending the empirical cooling rate @xcite , which is proportional to density , @xmath53 ( erg @xmath54s@xmath55 ) .",
    "we switch off the cooling when temperature becomes lower than the surface temperature , @xmath35 .",
    "this treatment is probably too much simplified ; we plan to elaborate the treatment of the cooling in our future works ( see section 4.3 ) .    as shown in equations ( [ eq : mass ] )  ( [ eq : moc ] ) , our treatment is based on one fluid mhd , which requires well coupling between gas and magnetic fields .",
    "to fulfill this condition , sufficient electrons are necessary to couple field lines and weakly ionized media , although the required ionization degree can be as small as @xmath56  @xmath57 whereas the actual value is up to density . in our calculation",
    "we assume the ideal mhd approximation .",
    "however , it is not clear that whether the ideal mhd approximation is applicable for the calculation of hot jupiters or not , because the temperature is not so high @xmath58 and ionization degree supposed to be small .",
    "here we show the applicability of the ideal mhd approximation for our calculations of the atmosphere of hot jupiters following an estimate for the atmosphere of brown dwarfs by sorahana et al.(2014 ) .",
    "an induction equation is expressed as follow , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is resistivity .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of magnetic field , and @xmath61 corresponds to the ideal mhd approximation .",
    "if the second term of the right hand side dominates over the first term , the magnetic field diffuse out and the ideal mhd approximation is no longer valid .",
    "the most dominant origin of the resistivity in the atmosphere of hot jupiters is the collision between electrons and neutral particles .",
    "this resistivity depends on temperature and an ionization degree , and it can be expressed as @xmath62 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to estimate the applicability of the ideal mhd approximation , it is useful to introduce a magnetic raynolds number , @xmath63 @xmath64 is a typical length of a system . if the magnetic raynolds number @xmath65 is quite larger than unity , the ideal mhd approximation is applicable . for the typical length of the system ,",
    "we use the typical wavelength of wave that we are injecting as a perturbation , @xmath66 @xmath67 is the velocity and almost same as @xmath68 , because we assume the equipartition of gas pressure and magnetic pressure for the magnetic flux tube in our calculation .",
    "@xmath69 is a typical timescale and given approximately by the pressure scale height of the atmosphere divided by the sound speed of the surface . in the situation",
    "that a planet has jupiter radius and jupiter mass and the surface temperature is 1000 k , the typical timescale can be written as @xmath70 from equation ( [ typicallength ] ) . from equation ( [ resistivity ] ) and",
    "( [ typl2 ] ) , the estimation of @xmath65 as follow : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is normalized by the value of the velocity dispersion we are injecting , @xmath73 . according to equation ( [ rm1 ] ) ,",
    "the ideal mhd approximation is applicable to the description of the atmosphere of hot jupiters even if the ionization degree is not so large .",
    "the requirement condition for the ideal mhd approximation is more mild in upper atmosphere , because the amplitude of waves become larger due to decreasing of the density of the atmosphere .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath64 and many other terms can vary with the difference of the conditions , because there are a variety of properties of hot jupiters .",
    "for example , the scale height is significantly large in the gaseous planet with smaller mass , larger radius and hence , lower surface gravity . in this case ,",
    "typical timescale @xmath69 is larger because of large scale height , therefore the ideal mhd approximation also is better .",
    "in this section we describe parameter dependence of the mass loss rate from gaseous planets and the atmospheric structure .",
    "first , we show the relation between velocity dispersion of the magnetic field at the surface of planets and the mass loss rate from gaseous planets , and the atmospheric structure .",
    "perturbations at the surface excite mhd waves , and they propagate upward .",
    "mhd waves dissipate at the upper atmosphere , then gas is heated and given momentum .",
    "here we assume that poynting flux of mhd wave driven by disturbance at the surface drives gas flow from gaseous planets .",
    "in this calculation disturbance of the magnetic field is given at the photosphere of gaseous planets .",
    "total energy transported by mhd wave varies with given strength of disturbance , therefore the mass loss rate should depend on the velocity dispersion .",
    "the origin of disturbance is turbulence that is caused by the convection .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersion of turbulence at the photosphere of the sun is about @xmath74 of sound speed @xcite .",
    "the strength of turbulence at the surface of exoplanets is unknown , so we treat the value of velocity dispersion as a parameter .",
    "we adopt its value comparable to the value at the sun , or less than it . in the case of young gaseous planets ,",
    "velocity dispersion of turbulence might be very large because cooling due to convective heat transport is expected to be active .",
    "therefore , the values of parameters we adopted for this calculation and the resultant mass loss rate might be underestimated .    .",
    "]    a relation between the velocity dispersion at the surface of gaseous planets and the mass loss rate is shown in fig [ dv - massloss ] .",
    "mass loss rate increases with an increase of the value of the velocity dispersion , because of the larger energy deposition in the magnetic flux tube . in the small velocity dispersion region",
    "the mass loss rate increases very rapidly with @xmath75 , but in the high velocity dispersion region the increase of the mass loss rate become small . in spite of the increase of energy deposited to the magnetic flux tube the mass loss rate saturates .",
    "this result suggests that there is an upper limit of the mass loss rate that is driven by magnetic energy .",
    "the increase of the mass loss rate is mainly by the increase of the density in the wind , which also enhances the radiative cooling because it is in proportional to @xmath76 in the optically thin limit . as a result",
    ", a larger fraction of the input poynting flux is lost by the radiation rather than transferred to the kinetic energy of the wind @xcite .",

    "corona - like regions appear at the upper atmosphere of the gaseous planets , whereas the temperature here is much lower than the temperature of the solar corona ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the density profiles of the lower atmosphere are almost same regardless of the given values of the velocity dispersion , but they changes in the regions where the temperature rises rapidly due to the dissipation of mhd waves . if the value of the velocity dispersion is larger , larger amount of gas is uplifted and the density decreases more gradually than that of the case with the smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "the value of the velocity dispersion and the strength of convection at the surface of exoplanets are unknown .",
    "the origin of the velocity dispersion at the surface of the sun is considered to be turbulence in the surface convective layer .",
    "while in gaseous planets the similar mechanism is supposed to operate , in hot jupiters the radiative - convective boundary is located in at a deep location ( @xmath80 ) @xcite .",
    "however convective over - shoot and propagating waves from convection region may provide the injected @xmath75 in our paper , whereas @xmath81 might be smaller than the typical solar value because of the deeper radiative - convective boundary .",
    "on the other hand , we can not imagine that there is no flow on the surface of rotating gaseous object irradiated from one side .",
    "indeed , recent numerical studies for atmospheric circulation on hot jupiters suggest that equatorial wind speed can reach @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "these results imply that supersonic atmospheric flow can exist on the surface of hot jupiters , therefore turbulence may be created in the atmosphere of hot jupiters . in the following section ,",
    "we adopt @xmath73 as a typical value of the velocity dispersion at the surface of gaseous planets .",

    ", the dependence of the mass loss rate on the radius with the same mass can be expressed as the following equation , @xmath118 this analytically - derived parametric dependence of the mass loss rate is shown in fig [ allfit ] .",
    "good agreement to our numerical simulation can be seen in the figure .     , factor @xmath119 is suggested by fitting , and vertical axis is the mass loss rate .",
    "the dot - dashed line correspond to @xmath120 ]      although observations of the mass loss rate from hot jupiters are limited , a lower limit of the mass loss rate is estimated from light curve during transit . according to the observation and analysis",
    ", it is estimated that lower limit of the mass loss rate from hd 209458b , that is considered a typical hot jupiter , is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "another transit observation also suggests that the mass loss rate from hd 209458b is in the range @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "note that these values of the mass loss rate are model - dependent , therefore they are not directly observed values . in our calculation ,",
    "the values of the mass loss rate are @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 with the velocity dispersion are @xmath125 , @xmath109 , and @xmath126 , respectively , their values are comparable with the estimation of the lower limit of the observation . the mass loss rate in the case of @xmath73 is the most similar value to the estimated value and the previous work .",
    "additionally , the velocity component as fast as @xmath127 is observed @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the velocity of escaping atmosphere is supersonic in all cases , and the values exceed @xmath128 in some cases .",
    "these results are consistent with the observations .",
    "the mass loss rate depends on the velocity dispersion , surface temperature , radius and mass of a planet , but these quantities can be determined by observations in near future , except for the velocity dispersion . in other words , we can estimate amplitude of the velocity dispersion at the surface of gaseous planets if our mechanism explains the observed mass loss rate from gaseous planets .      in this paper",
    ", we calculate the mass loss rate from hot jupiters and discuss its dependence on the velocity dispersion at the surface , radius , and mass of a planet with the constant surface temperature .",
    "the adopted surface temperature of a planet is @xmath77k that is considered to be a typical temperature of hot jupiters . to calculate the mass loss rate from lower temperature planets by decreasing the surface temperature",
    ", we should refine our calculation with more detailed thermal physics .",
    "then we can discuss the dependence of the mass loss rate on the surface temperature in near future .",
    "the surface temperature of a planet strongly depends on irradiation from the central star especially in a region near the star , therefore the surface temperature should be correlated with the semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "calculation of the mass loss rate not only from a hot jupiter , but also from a gaseous planet located at several au from a central star is our next work .",
    "the present treatment of the radiative cooling particularly for gas with @xmath129 k is crude .",
    "as described in section 2 , we adopt the empirical radiative loss function for the solar choromosphere @xcite for the gas with @xmath130 k @xmath131 k , in which the main coolants are hi , mgii , caii , and feii @xcite the cooling rates for these species are smaller for gas with lower temperature @xcite . on the other hand , molecules ( e.g. co , sio , cs , oh , h@xmath132o , etc . ) supersedes them as dominant coolants @xcite . although the cooling rate of these molecules seems roughly comparable to that of the main coolants for the solar chromosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for sio ) , the precise cooling rate depends on the actual structure of an atmosphere @xcite . at present",
    ", we can not tell whether our simplified treatment for the cooling overestimates or underestimates the radiative loss ; in future study , we need to incorporate these species with radiative transfer in a self - consistent manner into our dynamical simulations .",
