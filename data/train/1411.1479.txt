    "weyl semimetals are gapless systems with nontrivial momentum - space topology .  @xcite their low - energy excitations are described by three - dimensional ( 3d ) weyl fermions emerging from the degenerate points between energy bands , the so - called weyl nodes , in momentum space . in lattice systems , weyl nodes with opposite",
    "chiralities always appear in pairs because of the nielsen - ninomiya theorem .",
    "@xcite these nodes are topologically protected in the sense that they are robust against small perturbations unless two weyl nodes with opposite chiralities annihilate each other .",
    "interestingly , weyl nodes act as ( anti-)monopoles of the berry curvature with unit strength",
    ". they thus are sources of many remarkable electromagnetic responses , such as chiral anomaly and other anomaly - induced transport phenomena .",
    "@xcite since weyl semimetals could have these novel effects , material compounds with such nodal points are soon proposed , and some of them verified in experiments .",
    "@xcite a closely related class of materials with two weyl nodes at the same location has also been under intense study recently",
    ".  @xcite more of these nodal materials , with possible applications , are likely to emerge in the near future .    besides the anomalous hall effect ,",
    "@xcite weyl semimetals are proposed to have the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) , if pairs of weyl nodes have different energies .",
    "@xcite this effect gives a dissipationless electric current @xmath0 flowing along the direction of an applied magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in the simplest case of a weyl semimetal with just a single pair of weyl nodes , employing the low - energy effective theory with unbounded linear dispersion , the chiral magnetic current is shown to be @xmath2 with the cme coefficient @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy separation between weyl nodes .",
    "notably , @xmath5 takes a universal form and is independent of chemical potential or temperature . this result",
    "is usually explained by its resemblance to the chiral anomaly .",
    "@xcite    however , unlike the prediction of the anomalous hall effect in weyl semimetals , there has been an active debate regarding the existence of the cme .",
    "it was shown that , for the unbounded linearized effective models , the result could depend crucially on the regularization scheme .",
    "@xcite ( see also the discussion presented in appendix  [ cutoff ] . ) these authors emphasize that it is the ultra - violet cutoff in _ energy _ , rather than in _ momentum _ , that should be used in condensed matter .",
    "moreover , if energy cutoff is employed , then the cme will be absent .    in a recent work based on a lattice model , where the artificial ultra - violet cutoff is not necessary ,",
    "the equilibrium chiral magnetic current is shown to be zero also .",
    "@xcite indeed , as explained by baar _",
    "et al . _ , a nonzero equilibrium chiral magnetic current induced by a static magnetic field at zero temperature would cause a conceptual problem .",
    "@xcite once it exists , it can be used to extract energy from a ground state in global equilibrium at zero temperature , which should be impossible .",
    "therefore , the existence of the cme seems to be ruled out .",
    "later , the absence of the cme was challenged in ref .  ,",
    "in which the importance of the limiting procedure around zero wave - vector ( @xmath6 ) and zero frequency ( @xmath7 ) is pointed out ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "notice that the previous null result was achieved under static magnetic fields ,  @xcite which corresponds to the _ static _ limit ( i.e. , @xmath7 before @xmath8 ) .",
    "physically , the absence of current in this limit is expected , because a new equilibrium distribution of charges will be established and after that no current will flow .",
    "@xcite besides , the result of no chiral magnetic current in the static limit is consistent with the aforementioned argument in ref .  , because this limit gives equilibrium properties .",
    "therefore , the correct dc transport properties should be calculated under the _ uniform _ ( or long - wavelength ) limit ( i.e. , @xmath6 before @xmath9 ) .",
    "further justification of the uniform limit in deriving the dc transport quantities is elucidated in refs .  .",
    "in this paper , we try to provide a definite answer to the existence of the cme .",
    "the controversies in literature are clarified as best as we can . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on a generic two - band model of weyl semimetals .",
    "because the main feature of weyl semimetals is the existence of point degeneracies ( weyl points ) between energy bands , a simple two - band model is sufficient for the essential physics of weyl semimetals . within the linear - response theory",
    ", we arrive at distinctive expressions of the cme coefficient for two different limits approaching zero frequency - momentum .",
    "it shows that the limiting procedure does play a crucial role in deriving correct transport properties , in favour of the arguments in ref .  .",
    "since these results are based on a lattice model , where no linearization in energy dispersion is employed and no artificial ultra - violet cutoff is introduced , our conclusion should have general validity .    to evaluate the magnitude of the cme coefficient numerically , a specific form of a minimal lattice model with only two weyl nodes is chosen .",
    "we find that , in the static limit , there is no cme ; while the cme coefficient does become nonzero in the uniform limit .",
    "the former is consistent with the general argument discussed in the early literature .",
    "@xcite besides , in contrast to the prediction based on linearized effective models , the value of the cme coefficient in the uniform limit shows nontrivial dependence on various model parameters , including the chemical potential , the temperature , and the energy separation between two weyl nodes . in particular , when the chemical potential lies far away from the energies of the two weyl nodes , such that linearized models are no longer appropriate , the cme coefficient can still be finite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : t1_dep](b ) for large @xmath10 .",
    "this nonzero value is hard to be understood from the perspective of chiral anomaly , since the concept of chirality becomes ambiguous there .",

    "a , the subtlety of using ultra - violet cutoff for a linearized effective model is explained .",
    "finally , using the semiclassical wave - packet dynamics , the correct forms of the distribution function in both of the zero frequency - momentum limits are discussed in app .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a generic two - band model of weyl semimetal , which is sufficient to describe its main feature of point degeneracies between energy bands . within the linear - response theory ,",
    "both expressions of the cme coefficient @xmath11 in the uniform and the static limits are derived , as shown in eqs .   and [ or ] .",
    "they are the major results in this section .",

    "that is , @xmath11 behaves non - analytically in the zero frequency - momentum limit .",
    "readers not interested in this derivation may skip directly to section  iii , wherein the behavior of the cme coefficient under the variation of several model parameters is discussed .",
    "the most general two - band hamiltonian describing a non - interacting system can be expressed in the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are the three pauli matrices and @xmath17 stands for the bloch wavevector of electrons .",
    "the two bands may represent different physical degrees of freedom ( say , spin or pseudospin for two sublattices ) depending on the context .",
    "the band energies for the present model are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the norm of the 3-vector @xmath20 .    within the linear - response theory ,",

    "note that @xmath35 is singular if the norm @xmath36 vanishes at a @xmath37 point .    because the electric current is a vector and",

    "now the origin of the non - analyticity of @xmath11 in the zero frequency - momentum limit can be understood as follows .",
    "the sum over band indices in eq .   can be separated into two parts : the intraband contribution for @xmath53 and the interband contribution for @xmath54 .",
    "we find that , when @xmath53 , @xmath55 vanishes at @xmath56 .",
    "thus the leading term in small @xmath57 becomes @xmath58 on the other hand , for @xmath53 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 employing these observations and eqs .   and , we find that the _ intraband _ contribution of @xmath11 vanishes identically in the uniform limit ( @xmath6 before @xmath9 ) , which corresponds to the dc limit of a transport coefficient . however , it becomes nonzero in the static limit ( @xmath7 before @xmath8 ) .",
    "as a consequence , the two limits , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , do not commute and @xmath11 thus behaves non - analytically at @xmath63 .",
    "this conclusion remains true even after including the interband contribution of @xmath11 , since the latter has a unique value in both frequency - momentum limits .",

    "notice that , as seen from eq .  , the intraband part vanishes in this limit and only the _ interband _ part contributes to the cme coefficient .",

    "@xcite    in the next section , an explicit form of the two - band model is considered .",
    "we find that either eq .",
    "or eq .   always gives a vanishing value of the cme coefficient for all model parameters .",
    "it shows that there is no cme in the static limit , which is consistent with the general argument mentioned in refs .  .",
    "before closing this section , some remarks are in order .",
    "first , the same approach has been employed in ref .  .",
    "while our result in the uniform limit [ i.e. , eq",
    ".  ] agrees with theirs , our expression in the static limit [ i.e. , eq .  ]",
    "we believe that the expression here is correct , because it agrees with the one in the semiclassical approach for a static magnetic field [ i.e. , eq .  ] .",
    "second , one should not be too surprised by the nonanalyticity of @xmath11 at @xmath63 , because many response functions are known to behave non - analytically in the neighborhood of zero momentum and zero frequency . for instance ,",
    "the static current - current correlation function @xmath73 of superfluids will give the normal fluid density @xmath74 under the limiting procedure @xmath75 being taken before @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "however , it yields the total density @xmath78 if @xmath76 , @xmath77 are taken before @xmath75 .",
    "besides , the dielectric response function @xmath79 of an electron gas behaves very differently in the static and the uniform limits .",
    "@xcite the former , @xmath80 , describes the electrostatic screening of electric fields , while the latter , @xmath81 , gives the plasma oscillation in the uniform limit .",
    "the non - analyticity in the correlation functions appears as well in the field theories with lorentz symmetry at finite temperatures . as an example , the induced chern - simons coefficient of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic field theory ( qed ) , which is extracted from the parity violating part of current - current correlation function of fermions , has been shown to behave non - analytically in the zero frequency - momentum limit at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite all these facts show that the order of the limits is often important and only physics context can dictate the proper order .",
    "in order to have a concrete understanding of the formal results in sec .  [ sec : lrt ] , we adopt a minimum model with only two weyl nodes to investigate the cme .",
    "it is an extension of the qi - wu - zhang model in the study of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum anomalous hall effect  @xcite and is equivalent to the 3d lattice model considered in ref .  .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath82 where the spin - orbit interaction and the magnetization - related parts are @xmath83 here @xmath84 represents the hopping integral along the @xmath16 direction , @xmath85 is the strength of the spin - orbit coupling , and @xmath86 is the magnetization .",
    "notice that a nonzero @xmath84 would break the space - inversion symmetry about @xmath87 : @xmath88 , while @xmath89 breaks time - reversal symmetry : @xmath90 .",
    "the energies of the two bands are    @xmath91    in addition to the cme , weyl semimetal exhibits the anomalous hall effect .",
    "@xcite this effect gives an electric current flowing in a direction perpendicular to the applied electric field .",
    "for an electric field in the @xmath41 direction and a current in the @xmath15 direction , the hall conductivity is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath16-component of the berry curvature of band @xmath49 [ see eq .  ] . according to this formula",
    ", the anomalous hall effect can be understood as follows .",
    "@xcite a pair of weyl nodes with opposite chiralities is connected by a string of gauge singularities ( i.e. , the dirac string ) in the 3d brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "a 2d cross section of the 3d bz that intersects the dirac string would have a quantized 2d hall conductivity at zero temperature . by summing over the contributions of all the 2d cross sections , a weyl semimetal would have a nonzero hall conductivity , and",
    "thus shows the anomalous hall effect .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath86 and @xmath85 ( the latter is assumed to be positive ) , the ground state can be either in a trivial phase or in an anomalous hall phase . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the two bands are separated by an energy gap and the ground state is trivial .",
    "when @xmath95 , a dirac node ( i.e. , two overlapped weyl nodes ) appears at @xmath96 . upon the decrease in @xmath86",
    ", it splits to two weyl nodes moving along opposite @xmath97 directions [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : node](a ) ] .",
    "the two nodes merge again at @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",

    "fig : node](c ) ] .",
    "after that , the system becomes fully gapped and returns to the trivial phase with zero hall conductivity .",
    "in addition to the _ momentum _ separation , one can also alter the _ energy _ separation between the two nodes with the parameter @xmath84 .",

    "these are not the most general features of @xmath123 and @xmath5 , but are true for the two - band model studied .      in this subsection",
    ", the dependence of the hall conductivity @xmath123 and the cme coefficient @xmath5 on the magnetization @xmath86 is discussed .",
    "here we take the chemical potential @xmath124 .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath114 and temperature @xmath148 .",
    "in this simpler case , the weyl nodes ( if they exist ) all have zero energy and there is thus no cme .",
    "that is , @xmath5 will be zero for the whole range of @xmath86 .",
    "on the other hand , the hall conductivity @xmath123 depends nontrivially on @xmath86 . for @xmath114 and @xmath124 ,",
    "all states in the lower energy band are occupied at zero temperature , and the hall conductivity @xmath123 is thus proportional to the length of the dirac string @xmath149 .",
    "as being explained at the beginning of this section , the value of @xmath86 determines the distance between a pair of weyl nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : node ] ) , and the dependence on @xmath86 of the hall conductivity @xmath123 can be easily understood .",
    "when @xmath150 ( @xmath118 ) , two bands are separated by an energy gap and there is no weyl node .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath86 is decreased from 1 to @xmath151 , the length of the dirac string @xmath149 increases from zero to @xmath152 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : node](a ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 will monotonically increase from zero to its maximum value of @xmath100 .",
    "when one reduces @xmath86 from @xmath151 to @xmath153 , two anti - dirac strings along the @xmath97 axis appear , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : node](b ) .",

    "when @xmath86 decreases from @xmath153 to @xmath156 , a dirac string appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : node](c ) , which leads to an increase of the hall conductivity .",
    "finally , the negative @xmath123 is compensated to reach the value of zero when @xmath157 . beyond that , the system is a trivial insulator with @xmath141 .     in units of @xmath100 as a function of the magnetization @xmath86 .",

    "it is in an anomalous hall phase when @xmath159 .",
    "notice that the positions of the peak of @xmath123 in ( a ) and the zero of @xmath5 in ( b ) do not coincide .",
    "this difference grows for larger @xmath84.,width=307 ]    we now come back to the case when @xmath115 .",
    "the dependence of the hall conductivity @xmath123 on the magnetization @xmath86 for @xmath121 at low temperature @xmath128 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_dep](a ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath123 is anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath160 .",
    "the general behaviour looks similar to that described above for the @xmath114 case .",
    "however , the weyl nodes move away from zero energy for the present case of @xmath121 , and one can not fill only the lower band even when @xmath124",
    ". therefore , the peak values of @xmath123 is no longer quantized at @xmath161 . besides , one now has smooth peaks located away from @xmath120 and @xmath153 [ see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : m_dep](a ) around @xmath120 ] .",
    "such a deviation becomes quite apparent if one chooses a larger value of @xmath84 .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the cme coefficient @xmath5 on @xmath86 for @xmath121 and @xmath128 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_dep](b ) , which is symmetric with respect to @xmath160 .",
    "we note that @xmath5 changes sign near , but not at , @xmath120 and @xmath155 [ see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : m_dep](b ) around @xmath120 ] , even though the weyl nodes merge in the 3d bz for these special values of @xmath86 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : node ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when @xmath115 , the two bands overlap near the chemical potential @xmath124 , before the merge of the weyl nodes at @xmath119 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : band](d ) ] .",
    "the deviation of the locations of @xmath163 from these special values of @xmath86 for node merging becomes quite apparent at a larger value of @xmath84 .",
    "since the parameter @xmath84 has nothing to do with the topology of the ground state , such a sign change of @xmath5 is not related to a quantum phase transition , but is only a result of the distortion of the electronic structure .",
    "also , notice that there is no chiral magnetic effect when the lower band is completely filled ( @xmath150 or @xmath164 ) .",
    "that is , a filled band can not carry an electric current , which is consistent with conventional wisdom .",
    "from this investigation , the following lessons have been learned .",
    "first , the choice of the ultra - violet cutoff can be crucial in calculating quantities for unbounded , linearized effective theories . in the present case ,",
    "energy cutoff should be used and then the correct result of null equilibrium current will be reached .",
    "@xcite therefore , one should be cautious in deriving results by using unbounded , linearized effective theories .",
    "second , different limiting procedures usually correspond to different experimental arrangements and thus different physical results .",
    "the correct dc transport quantities , say , the cme coefficient studied here , should be obtained under the uniform limit .",
    "@xcite confusing conclusions can be drawn under the wrong type of limit .",
    "besides , we note that the non - analyticity in @xmath11 poses a serious issue regarding the validity of the _ local _ chern - simons term in the effective action of weyl semimetals .",
    "usually , the fascinating electromagnetic properties of weyl semimetals is described by a radiatively induced chern - simons term in the effective action after integrating out fermions ,  @xcite @xmath165 the coefficients @xmath166 can be obtained from the derivatives of an  axion \" field @xmath167 . in the frequency - momentum domain , the effective action reads as @xmath168 with @xmath169 which is nothing but the generalization of eq .  .",
    "that is , the coefficients @xmath166 are proportional to @xmath170 in the limit of zero frequency and momentum .",
    "however , as shown above , @xmath170 are not analytic at @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that we are not always allowed to expand the effective action as a series of local terms .",
    "that is , we do not have a _ bona fide _ induced local chem - simons term .",
    "finally , a cautionary remark is given . in this work ,",
    "clean and infinite systems are presumed . however , real samples are always finite in sizes ( with possible surface states ) , accompanied by disorders , and connected to external reservoirs .",
    "it is known that the kubo - formula results for usual electric transport remain mostly reliable in realistic situations .",
    "nevertheless , in the present case , whether these complications would qualitatively alter the conclusion in this paper ( and nullify the cme ) remains an open question .",
    "it is an important issue worthy of further investigations .    in conclusion",
    ", we address the issue of the existence of the cme carefully . for weyl semimetals described by a generic two - band model ,",
    "different expressions of the cme coefficient are obtained under different limiting procedures .",
    "it shows that the cme coefficient behaves non - analytically in the zero frequency - momentum limit . employing an explicit form of the two - band model ,",
    "we show that the chiral magnetic current in an equilibrium state under the static limit vanishes as expected .",
    "nevertheless , the cme does exist under the correct dc limit ( i.e. , the uniform limit ) and its proportional coefficient exhibits nontrivial dependence on various system parameters .",
    "furthermore , even when the linearization of energy dispersion is not valid , such that chirality may not be well defined , the cme can still be finite .",
    "it shows that this effect does not crucially depend on the chiral anomaly .",
    "our work clarifies some subtleties in calculating the cme coefficient .",
    "it should be of help to future researchers studying related effects of weyl semimetals and other nodal materials .",

    "this conclusion is consistent with the viewpoint that there is no equilibrium current in the static limit .",
