    "in the superconducting state of optimally doped , a gap - like depression develops in the frequency dependence of the @xmath0-axis conductivity for @xmath11 less than @xmath12 . as emphasized by homes _",
    "et al._,@xcite this behavior is quite different from the in - plane @xmath3 conductivity observed in samples from the same source .",
    "we have recently developed a simple model for the @xmath3 conductivity which provided a qualitative fit to experimental data , and here we extend this model to see how well it can describe the @xmath0-axis conductivity .",
    "the model consists of bcs quasi - particles with a @xmath2 gap and a lifetime determined by both elastic and inelastic scattering processes .",
    "the latter inelastic lifetime plays a key role in our model and was calculated from a spin - fluctuation interaction in which the quasi - particle @xmath2 gap entered explicitly in determining the spectral weight of the spin - fluctuations .",
    "the elastic scattering , which is important at low frequencies , was treated in the resonant impurity scattering limit . here ,",
    "in discussing the @xmath0-axis conductivity , we will treat the interlayer transport as weak and diffusive .",
    "our conclusion from this analysis is that a model of a @xmath2 superconductor which includes inelastic as well as elastic scattering can provide a sensible fit of both the @xmath3 and the @xmath0-axis conductivities . in particular",
    ", it predicts the existence of absorption features at @xmath13 in @xmath4 and at @xmath14 in @xmath1 , where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-wave gap maximum ; such features are apparently observed in a variety of materials . to the extent that the interlayer coupling can be treated as weak and diffusive ,",
    "the @xmath0-axis conductivity provides direct information on the single particle density of states in a similar manner to sis tunneling .",
    "the nature of @xmath0-axis transport in the cuprates is still controversial , but it is widely believed to be weak and incoherent .",
    "@xcite a simple model which describes this has @xmath17 , where @xmath18 describes free particles with residual @xmath19 bcs pair interaction , and @xmath20 where the @xmath21 may be thought of as randomly placed static impurities mediating hopping between planes 1 and 2 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the end result of our treatment will yield a description in terms of a single @xmath0-axis relaxation time which must be similar to any weak diffusive transport model .",
    "the interplane paramagnetic current operator for a given configuration of the random potential is then @xmath22 the response to an applied electromagnetic field @xmath23 is now determined by expanding the kinetic energy of the system up to second order in @xmath23 , yielding for the expectation value of the total current @xmath24 a_z ( { \\bf q } , \\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 to leading order .",
    "we first examine the conductivity @xmath26 , assuming that @xmath27 is weak , thereby neglecting multiple scattering vertex corrections as well as self - energy corrections , since one power of @xmath27 is already contained in each of the @xmath0-axis current operators which enter @xmath28 .",
    "after impurity averaging , we find @xmath29 with @xmath30 here the normal and anomalous spectral functions are defined as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the matrix green s function @xmath34 the interlayer scattering matrix element @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 where m runs over all lattice sites and i labels an impurity site . for simplicity we take a cylindrical fermi surface with @xmath37 and a @xmath2 gap @xmath38 .",
    "the renormalized frequency @xmath39 includes the effects of scattering associated with the in - plane impurities and the lifetime effects due to dynamic spin fluctuations . in the resonant limit",
    ", the in - plane impurity scattering gives a renormalized quasi - particle energy @xmath39 determined by the self - consistent solution of @xmath40 here @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the impurity concentration and @xmath43 the fermi level density of states .",
    "we assume further that the inelastic scattering rate @xmath44 arising from spin fluctuations can be calculated separately , and take as a model the one - antiparamagnon self - energy calculated in a 2d hubbard model by quinlan _",
    "et al._@xcite the momentum dependence of the full @xmath45 has been neglected here in favor of a simpler effective relaxation rate for quasiparticles at the gap nodes , @xmath46 as discussed in refs .",
    "and at low temperatures @xmath47 varies as @xmath48 for @xmath49 , reflecting the usual @xmath50 dependence of an electron - electron scattering process along with a third factor of @xmath51 arising from the @xmath2 density of states . for @xmath52 ,",
    "@xmath53 crosses over to the pseudo - linear behavior found in spin - fluctuation scattering calculations in the normal state.@xcite although for concreteness we have chosen a particular model for @xmath53 , we note that the behavior in the superconducting state is characteristic of any model based on electron - electron scattering with quasiparticles which are well - defined at sufficiently low temperatures , in the presence of gap line nodes .    combining the elastic and inelastic contributions , we set @xmath54 in eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "the resulting lifetime for in - plane scattering is plotted in fig .  1 for several values of the impurity concentration .",
    "note the hubbard parameters have been chosen so as to give a value of @xmath55 .    as discussed by graf _",
    "et al._,@xcite setting @xmath56 equal to a constant corresponds to diffuse transmission , while taking an extreme forward scattering form such that @xmath57 ( that is , @xmath58 ) corresponds to specular transmission . in the diffuse transmission limit , the second term in eq .",

    "the primary feature seen in the figure is the pseudogap of width @xmath14 which opens up below @xmath12 .",
    "the low - frequency behavior can be estimated in this limit to be @xmath79 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the effects of adding anisotropy to the interplane scattering , as well as intraplane scattering effects . because of the form of eq .",
    "( 12 ) as a convolution of normal and anomalous densities of states , the shoulder feature at @xmath80 is quite robust .",
    "while strongly scattering in - plane impurities ( @xmath81 ) can alter the very low - frequency behavior , the @xmath14 shoulder is essentially unaffected .",
    "the large intraplane relaxation rate near @xmath12 might be expected to change the behavior in an important way , but this is seen not to be the case , since the effect of a large @xmath82 is simply to smear out the density of states factors entering eq .",
    "scattering anisotropy @xmath83 also does not lead to important qualitative differences from the results of fig .  2 , since the anomalous terms in the convolution give rise to a low - energy contribution to the conductivity of order @xmath84 .",
    "the results in these limits are therefore similar to those obtained earlier by graf et al.@xcite in fig .",
    "4 we compare these results to the experimental data of homes _ et al . _",
    "; here we have chosen a parameter set which appears to give a reasonable fit to the @xmath3 penetration depth and conductivity , but the @xmath0-axis conductivity is not terribly sensitive to this choice .    due to the weak behavior of the anomalous density of states at low temperatures ,",
    "we note that within this model a measurement of the @xmath0-axis conductivity provides a nearly direct measurement of the in - plane density of states @xmath8 .",
    "it will be interesting to compare @xmath8 obtained in this way to results obtained , e.g. , from tunneling measurements .",

    "note the last approximate equality is valid for @xmath90 in the clean limit only .",
    "the expression ( 17 ) is equivalent to the result obtained by radtke _",
    "et al._@xcite in the absence of direct interlayer tunneling . in fig .",
    "5 we have plotted the temperature dependence of @xmath91 for various values of the in - plane impurity scattering rate . as in the @xmath3 case , @xcite we expect a crossover to a @xmath92 behavior at low temperatures when the system becomes sufficiently dirty . although the normalized superfluid density @xmath93 is quite insensitive to the presence of planar impurities , as seen in fig .  5",
    ", we note the peculiar result that in this model the penetration depth itself scales roughly with the @xmath0-axis conductivity , and should therefore be quite sensitive to disorder which affects @xmath0-axis transport .",
    "in constructing phenomenological theories of this kind , it is important to see if a consistent description of a wide class of experiments can be obtained , along with an understanding of the effects of disorder . in this regard",
    "we would like to predict correlations among various quantities which should hold at least for all optimally doped materials , and possibly in the underdoped systems as well .",
    "the most important such correlation to emerge from the current analysis is the prediction of a clear shoulder in the @xmath0-axis conductivity at @xmath94 , a broad maximum in the @xmath3 conductivity at @xmath13 , and a shoulder - like feature in @xmath95 at @xmath96 . since the gap maximum @xmath15 is not known for all materials,@xcite",
    "one can search for correlations of such features in optical experiments .",
    "while such a method will not provide the most accurate measure of the gap size , it will serve to confirm the general picture of a @xmath16-wave order parameter with nodal quasiparticles scattered by resonant defects of some kind at low energies , and strong spin - fluctuation scattering at higher energies . in fig .  6",
    ", we show @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath97 together to illustrate the correlations we expect . in fig .  7 , we show data on @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 from recent work by basov _",
    "et al._@xcite here we would like to note some similarities between the results for the optimally doped material below its @xmath12 , and the behavior of the underdoped materials above their transition temperatures in the so - called pseudogap regime .",
    "the most distinct feature is the shoulder in @xmath1 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "7 ) , which , as we have discussed , occurs at @xmath101 for @xmath98 . in the underdoped compounds",
    "this shoulder , at what we will call `` @xmath14 '' , becomes visible above @xmath12 in the pseudogap regime . in the underdoped compounds , `` @xmath14 '' from this criterion",
    "is slightly reduced from its value in the optimally doped materials .",
    "the second panel in fig .",
    "7 shows @xmath102 . in ref .",
    ", the absence of a @xmath14 structure and the broad rise at @xmath13 observed in the @xmath3-plane conductivity of @xmath98 below @xmath12 at 1000 @xmath103 was attributed to a @xmath13 inelastic absorption threshold smeared by @xmath16-wave nodal quasiparticles .",
    "now , as is well known , there is no gaplike structure in the @xmath3 conductivity ( second panel of fig .",
    "7 ) in the doping range for which the pseudogap is observed in the @xmath0-axis conductivity ; there is , however , a narrowing of the drude peak and a broad rise at higher frequencies near `` @xmath13 '' .",
    "it could be that the appearance of the `` @xmath104 '' in @xmath1 but not in @xmath4 is similar to the behavior we have found for these quantities below @xmath12 in the model we have applied to @xmath98 , in which the crucial factor is the direct relevance of the density of states @xmath105 to @xmath0-axis transport .",
    "support for the correlation of the @xmath0-axis pseudogap and the density of state is found in studies by homes _",
    "et al._@xcite which found scaling of the pseudogap with the knight shift in underdoped cuprates . finally , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .  7 , that the in - plane relaxation rate for the underdoped materials shows a strong supression of the linear frequency dependence in the pseudogap regime even above @xmath12 . in all cases shown",
    ", the crossover to stronger frequency dependence at sufficiently low temperatures occurs at an energy consistent with the `` @xmath96 '' smeared threshold expected from the current model .",
    "we turn finally to the comparison of the @xmath0-axis penetration depth with its @xmath3 counterpart .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  8 for the clean limit , and compared to the data of hardy _ et al._@xcite on @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear that the result agrees qualitatively with the much flatter temperature dependence of the @xmath0-axis penetration depth found at low temperatures .",
    "the low temperature behavior is not yet well characterized , however .",
    "the discrepancies result , in the intermediate temperature range , from the crude isotropic band structure assumed , and in the range close to @xmath12 from critical fluctuations not accounted for in the current model .",
    "we have argued that a simple theory of @xmath16-wave superconductivity , together with impurity and spin fluctuation scattering , accounts for most of the qualitative aspects of both optical conductivity and london penetration depth measurements for currents along both the @xmath107 and @xmath0 axes .",
    "@xmath0-axis properties have been calculated under the further assumption that transport is primarily diffusive .",
    "the optical conductivities @xmath1 and @xmath4 may then be correlated in this model , in that we expect a broad peak in @xmath4 at @xmath108 and a shoulder - like feature in @xmath1 at @xmath109 .",
    "this behavior indeed appears to be reproduced qualitatively in several materials , including underdoped materials , where a behavior qualitatively similar to that observed in the optimally doped materials below @xmath12 is seen significantly above @xmath12 .",
    "if the phase coherence implicit in the bcs approach is ignored , the model considered here offers a natural interpretation of these results and an explanation of why the normal state @xmath0-axis pseudogap does not manifest itself in planar transport properties .",
    "further study is needed to put these speculations on a firmer basis .",
    "finally , we have calculated and compared the @xmath0-axis london penetration depth in the same model , and shown that in clean systems it will vary as @xmath110 at low temperatures .",
    "this temperature dependence is much stronger than the @xmath3 result , @xmath111 in the same model , in qualitative agreement with experiments on optimally doped .",
