    "we denote the set of all @xmath10-elements in @xmath0 ( the _ verbal _ set defined by @xmath10 ) . the set @xmath14 $ ] generates the _ verbal _ subgroup @xmath15 .",
    "the verbal subgroups of groups were intensely studied in group theory especially with respect to relatively free groups and varieties of groups ( see the book @xcite for details ) .",
    "if @xmath10 is finite then @xmath15 is equal to @xmath16 for a suitable single word @xmath1 . from now on",

    "the _ width _ @xmath22 of @xmath1 , as well as the _ @xmath1-width _ of the verbal subgroup @xmath16 , is defined by @xmath23 , so it is either a natural number or @xmath24 .",
    "finite width of verbal subgroups plays an important part in several areas of groups theory : finite groups , profinite and algebraic groups , polycyclic and abelian - by - nilpotent groups .    in finite groups",
    "one of the earliest questions on verbal width goes back to the ore s paper @xcite where he asked if the commutator length ( the @xmath25$]-length ) of every element in a non - abelian finite simple group is equal to 1 ( _ ore conjecture _ ) .",
    "only recently the conjecture was established by liebeck , obrian , shalev and tiep @xcite .",
    "for other recent spectacular results on verbal width in finite simple groups we refer to the papers @xcite , @xcite .    in profinite , as well as algebraic , groups",
    "the interest to verbal width comes from a fact that verbal subgroups of finite width are closed in profinite , correspondingly zariski , topology .",
    "this shows up in the proof of serre s result @xcite : if @xmath0 is a finitely generated pro - p group then every subgroup of finite index is open .",
    "serre raised the question if the above result holds for arbitrary finitely generated profinite groups . in 2007",
    "this conjecture was settled in affirmative by nikolov and segal @xcite . their proof is based in large on establishing uniform bounds on verbal width in finite groups .",
    "we refer to the book @xcite on verbal width in profinite and algebraic groups and to a recent survey @xcite .",
    "the study of verbal sets and subgroups in infinite groups was initiated by p. hall @xcite . in 1960",
    "s several fundamental results on verbal width in infinite groups were obtain in his school : stroud proved ( unpublished ) that all finitely generated abelian - by - nilpotent groups @xmath0 are _ verbally elliptic _",
    ", i.e. , every verbal subgroup @xmath16 of @xmath0 has finite @xmath1-width ; meanwhile rhemtulla showed in @xcite that every not infinite dihedral free product @xmath26 of non - trivial groups @xmath27 and @xmath28 is verbally parabolic .",
    "we refer again to the book @xcite for the history and detailed modern proofs .    shortly afterwards",
    ", hall s approach to verbal and marginal subgroups gave rise to an interesting research in malcev s algebraic school in russia .",
    "firstly , merzlyakov @xcite showed that linear algebraic groups are verbally elliptic , and then romankov @xcite ( independently of stroud and using different means ) showed that finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups are all verbally elliptic ; as well as all virtually polycyclic groups ( again , we refer to @xcite for concise proofs , generalizations and related new developments ) .",
    "since malcev s school was keen on model - theoretic problems in groups , it was quickly recognized there that verbal subgroups of finite width are first - order definable in the group , so they provide a powerful tool in the study of elementary theories of verbally elliptic groups , in particular , nilpotent groups .",
    "since then the elementary theories of finitely generated nilpotent groups and groups of @xmath29-points ( @xmath29 is a field ) of algebraic nilpotent groups were extensively studied @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it is known precisely which finitely generated nilpotent groups are elementarily equivalent @xcite ; or what are arbitrary groups ( perhaps , non - finitely generated ) which are elementarily equivalent to a given unipotent @xmath29-group @xcite , or a given unitriangular group @xmath30 @xcite , or a given finitely generated free nilpotent group @xcite .    in the opposite direction , remtulla s remarkable proof of verbal parabolicity of non - abelian free groups and non - trivial free products gave rise to several interesting generalizations . in @xcite grigorchuk studied bounded cohomologies of group constructions , and proved that verbal width of the commutator subgroup in a wide class of amalgamated free products and hnn extensions is infinite .",
    "bardakov showed that hnn extensions with proper associated subgroups and one - relator groups with at lest three generators are verbally parabolic @xcite ; as well as braid groups @xmath31 @xcite . for amalgamated free products",
    "dobrynina improved on the previous partial results by showing that @xmath32 is verbally parabolic , provided @xmath33 and @xmath34 for some @xmath35 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that many groups that have some kind of `` negative curvature '' are virtually parabolic .",
    "the main result in its pure form ( theorem [ width ] ) states that every non - elementary ( i.e. , non virtually cyclic ) hyperbolic group @xmath0 is verbally parabolic . as was mentioned above this implies that every group that have a non - elementary hyperbolic image is also verbally parabolic . in particular , the following groups are verbally parabolic : non - abelian residually free groups , pure braid groups , non - abelian right angled artin groups  all of them have free non - abelian quotients ( so these are corollaries of the original remtulla s result on free groups ) .",
    "less obvious examples include many relatively hyperbolic groups , e.g. , non - elementary groups hyperbolic relative to proper residually finite subgroups @xcite .",
    "thus , the fundamental groups of complete finite volume manifolds of pinched negative curvature , @xmath36 groups with isolated flats , groups acting freely on @xmath37trees are verbally parabolic .    the results above show that in the presence of negative curvature the verbal width is not a very sensitive characteristic of verbal subgroups . in this case",
    "it seems more convenient to consider a more smooth _ stable _",
    "@xmath1-length , which is defined for an element @xmath20 as the limit @xmath38 .",
    "it is known that the stable commutator length relates to an @xmath39 filling norm with rational coefficients , introduced by gromov in @xcite , see also gersten s paper @xcite . in @xcite gromov studied stable commutator length and its relation with bounded cohomology .",
    "we refer to a book @xcite by calegary on stable length of elements in groups .",
    "interestingly , calegari showed in @xcite that if a group @xmath0 satisfies a non - trivial law then the stable commutator length is equal to 0 for every element from @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "so it seems the verbal width and stable length operate nicely in very different classes of groups .",
    "we formulate a few open problems on verbal width in infinite groups . the first one ,",
    "if true , would make proofs of many results easier .",
    "is it true that finite extensions of virtually parabolic groups are virtually parabolic ?",
    "notice , that in general , verbal parabolicity is not a geometric property .",
    "indeed , there is a group @xmath41 with finite commutator width ( the commutator width is equal to 1 in @xmath41 ) , but some of its finite extensions has infinite commutator width ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 3.2.2 ) , so infinite width is not preserved by quasi - isometries .",
    "the second problem is an attempt to clarify if interesting groups without free subgroups can be verbally parabolic .",
    "it seems all known verbally parabolic groups have free non - abelian subgroups .",
    "is thompson group @xmath42 verbally parabolic ?    in general , verbal sets",
    "@xmath18 $ ] contain a lot of information about the group @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the membership problem ( mp ) to the set @xmath18 $ ] in @xmath0 is equivalent of solving in @xmath0 the homogeneous equations of the type @xmath43 , where @xmath9 .",
    "notice , that the diophantine problem ( of solvability of arbitrary equations ) is decidable in a free group @xmath44 @xcite , so the verbal sets are decidable .",
    "however , the actual algorithmic or formal language theoretic complexity of verbal sets in @xmath44 is unknown .",
    "is it true that proper verbal subsets of a non - elementary hyperbolic group are non - rational ?",
    "it is known that proper verbal set in free non - abelian groups are non - rational @xcite .",
    "remtulla s technique from @xcite played an important part in the proof of this result .",
