    "the equations of motion for an extended body in a given gravitational background were deduced by dixon @xcite ( hereafter the relativistic extended body model , `` or simply dixon s model '' ) in multipole approximation to any order . in the quadrupole approximation they read @xmath0}+\\frac43j^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma[\\mu}r^{\\nu]}{}_{\\gamma\\alpha\\beta}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) is the total four - momentum of the particle , and",
    "@xmath3 is a ( antisymmetric ) spin tensor ; @xmath4 is the timelike unit tangent vector of the center of mass line ",
    "@xmath5 used to make the multipole reduction , parametrized by the proper time @xmath6 .",
    "the tensor @xmath7 is the quadrupole moment of the stress - energy tensor of the body , and has the same algebraic symmetries as the riemann tensor . in this paper",
    "we limit our considerations to dixon s model under the further simplifying assumption @xcite that the only contribution to the complete quadrupole moment @xmath7 stems from the mass quadrupole moment @xmath8 , i.e. we write [ jdef ] j^=-3u_p^[q^][u_p^ ]  , q^u_p_=0  .    in order the model to be mathematically consistent the following additional condition should be imposed @xcite to the spin tensor [ tconds ] s^u_p_=0  , to ensure the correct definition of the various multipolar terms .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the spin vector by spatial ( with respect to @xmath9 ) duality [ spinvec ] s^=12 _ ^u_p^s _  , where @xmath10 is the unit volume 4-form and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the levi - civita alternating symbol , as well as the scalar invariant [ sinv ] s^2=12 s_s^=s_s^  , which is in general not constant along the path .",
    "there are no evolution equations for the quadrupole as well as higher multipoles as a consequence of the dixon s construction , so their evolution is completely free , depending only on the considered body .",
    "therefore the system of equations is not self - consistent , and one must assume that all unspecified quantities are known as intrinsic properties of the matter under consideration .",
    "moreover , the assumption that the considered body is a test body means that its mass , its spin as well as its quadrupole moments must all be small enough not to contribute significantly to the background metric .",
    "otherwise , backreaction must be taken into account .",
    "we investigate here how a small extended body at rest reacts to the passage of a single plane gravitational wave ( gpw ) in the weak field limit .",
    "the body is spinning and also endowed with a quadrupolar structure .",
    "the latter property allows us to consider this analysis as a good model for a bar antenna .",
