    "in the movie _ red planet _ ( 2000 ) , a spaceship traveling to mars simulates gravity by using a spinning wheel.@xcite the astronauts living inside the wheel are pushed against the outer wall , which they perceive as the floor , by the centrifugal force . at some point during the movie",
    "a power failure causes the wheel to stop spinning , leading to a zero gravity environment .",
    "this event provides the necessary dramatic setting for commander kate bowman to save the day , including explosively decompressing the wheel to extinguish a zero-@xmath0 fire .",
    "when she gets the main power back online the wheel starts spinning again , and everything  including her",
    " immediately falls to the floor .",
    "but as noted on the popular website `` bad astronomy,''@xcite this is not what would happen in such a situation . instead , imagine commander bowman floating motionless ( with respect to some inertial frame , say the rest frame of the distant stars ) inside the wheel ( see fig .",
    "[ costa_natariofig01 ] ) and assume , for simplicity , that there is no air inside the spaceship . from the point of view of the star fixed inertial frame",
    "it is clear that , no matter how fast the wheel spins , she will feel no force and will continue floating motionless inside the wheel .",
    "( that pushes her outwards ) , and a centripetal coriolis force @xmath1 , with twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force ( that pushes her inwards ) . ]",
    "if we take the perspective of the wheel s ( rotating ) frame and interpret the centrifugal ( inertial ) force as a gravitational field the situation looks very strange : commander bowman is subject to a gravitational force and yet she does not fall . after a moment s thought , one realizes that such a thing happens all the time in `` real '' gravitational fields : it is called being in orbit . in the wheel",
    "s rotating frame , commander bowman is moving along a circle with the right velocity so that she does not fall .",
    "however , the gravitational field ( centrifugal force ) points outward , away from the center of her trajectory .",
    "so how can she be in orbit in this gravitational field ?",
    "something is surely missing .",
    "the missing ingredient is , of course , the coriolis force ; it is this velocity - dependent force that pushes commander bowman towards the center of her orbit .",
    "this reminds us that einstein s equivalence principle,@xcite when applied to arbitrarily accelerated and rotating frames , requires the introduction of a magnetic - like coriolis field .    in this section",
    "we will revisit the problem of the inertial forces arising in an arbitrarily accelerated and rotating ( rigid ) frame , and obtain the so - called newton - cartan equations , which will be useful in our further study of the coriolis field in the next sections .",
    "let @xmath2 be the position vector of a particle of mass @xmath3 in an inertial frame @xmath4 ( say , the rest frame of the distant stars ) , and let @xmath5 be the position vector of the same particle in an accelerated and rotating frame @xmath6 ( for example , the wheel s frame ) . if we denote the position of the origin of @xmath6 in @xmath4 by @xmath7 then @xmath8 for some time - dependent rotation matrix @xmath9 .",
    "in the example above , for instance , @xmath10 represents the position of the center of the wheel and @xmath11 where we have assumed that the wheel is rotating around the @xmath12-axis with constant angular velocity @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that the particle is subject to a gravitational field @xmath14 plus a nongravitational force @xmath15 , then the particle s equation of motion will be @xmath16 where dots represent time derivatives . as usual , we take the gravitational field to satisfy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is newton s constant and @xmath19 is the mass density of the matter generating the field .",
    "to write the equation of motion in the frame @xmath6 , we note that @xmath20 since @xmath21 is a rotation matrix , its inverse coincides with its transpose : @xmath22 .",
    "hence @xmath23 that is , the matrix @xmath24 is antisymmetric ( and thus it has only three independent components , say @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "consequently , we can write @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the levi - civita alternating symbol , which means @xmath30 and thus @xmath31 note from eqs .   and that the velocity vector of a particle at rest in @xmath6 is @xmath32 where in the last equality we used the fact that rotations preserve cross products , since they preserve lengths , angles , and orientations .",
    "this equation tells us that @xmath33 is the angular velocity of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath4 , expressed in @xmath6 ( that is , the angular velocity in @xmath4 is @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that since @xmath35 depends only on time , then so does @xmath36 .",

    "that @xmath43 is minus the nongravitational force per unit mass acting on observers at rest in @xmath6 ; this is exactly what a weighing scale placed in @xmath6 will measure .",
    "moreover , eq .   implies that observers at rest in @xmath6 are seen to move in @xmath4 along the velocity field @xmath46 whose vorticity ( in @xmath4 ) is @xmath47=r{\\bf \\omega}\\ .\\label{eq : vorticitynewtonian}\\ ] ] here we have used the vector identity @xmath48 which holds for a spatially constant vector @xmath49 , together with the identities @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    ". this fact can be seen by noting that @xmath55 implies that @xmath56 , for some scalar function @xmath57 ; then @xmath58 implies @xmath59 , i.e , @xmath60 is the gradient of a solution of the laplace equation . by virtue of the green theorem ( see , e.g. , secs .",

    ". therefore it must be the solution whose gradient , that is , @xmath44 , is spatially constant .    if we take the curl of eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath61 to obtain this result , we : ( i ) used the covariance of this differential operator under rotations,@xcite so that @xmath62 ; ( ii ) noted , from elementary vector identities , that @xmath63 and @xmath64=\\nabla({\\bf \\omega}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})\\times{\\bf \\omega}={\\bf 0}$ ] ; and ( iii ) used eq .",

    "note the similarity of eqs .   with maxwell s equations , apart from the absence of source and displacement currents in the equation for @xmath70 and the nonlinear term in the equation for @xmath71 .    if there are no nongravitational forces acting on the particle , then its mass @xmath3 drops out of eq .  :",

    "are invariant under such changes ( just like the maxwell equations and the lorentz force law are invariant under changes of inertial frame ) . in this theory ,",
    "inertial frames are thus no longer privileged  all inertial forces are explained as a combination of the fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "unsurprisingly , it is the ( singular ) limit of general relativity as the speed of light tends to infinity.@xcite    the newton - cartan theory is , however , more general than the usual newtonian theory because it admits solutions with spatially varying coriolis fields , which do not correspond to a newtonian field as seen in an accelerated and rotating frame .",
    "such non - newtonian solutions can be excluded by imposing appropriate boundary conditions at infinity , and will not be considered here .",
    "the uniformly rotating frame provides a particular solution of the newton - cartan field equations with @xmath74 , given by @xmath75 where @xmath13 is the magnitude of the constant angular velocity , @xmath76 are the obvious cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the corresponding unit vectors .",
    "the condition for a particle to be in circular orbit , with tangential velocity @xmath79 is that the centripetal acceleration @xmath80 equals the gravitational acceleration in eq .  :",
    "@xmath81 this quadratic equation for @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 can be solved to give @xmath84 which corresponds to the particle being at rest in the non - rotating frame . from eq .",
    "it is clear that it is the coriolis force that provides commander bowman s centripetal acceleration that acts against the centrifugal force , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ costa_natariofig01](b ) .",
    "we can now also understand what happens if there is an atmosphere inside the wheel .",
    "initially , the air will also be moving with respect to the wheel , but friction with the walls will ultimately cause it to come to rest .",
    "therefore , commander bowman will end up moving with respect to the atmosphere , making her speed decrease due to friction .",
    "the coriolis force will therefore decrease and the centrifugal force will dominate , causing her to fall `` down . ''",
    "in other words , her orbit will decay .",
    "the gdel universe is a solution of the einstein field equations , describing a homogeneous universe filled with a pressureless fluid of constant vorticity.@xcite it exhibits puzzling features , such as closed timelike curves , and the fact that it rotates rigidly about any of its points .",
    "the newtonian analogue provides an interesting solution of the newton - cartan field equations , given , in a suitable frame , by@xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a constant .",
    "the matter fluid , of constant density @xmath19 , is assumed to be at rest in this frame ( which is consistent with @xmath87 ) .",
    "notice that observers at rest are free - falling , but measure nonzero coriolis forces , i.e. , they will see moving test particles being deflected by a coriolis force @xmath88 .",
    "this newton - cartan solution can be represented as a purely newtonian gravitational field by changing to a frame @xmath4 rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath89 relative to the initial frame . in this frame",
    "the fields become@xcite @xmath90 and the interpretation of the gdel universe is simple : the uniform distribution of matter , seen as an infinite cylinder , generates a radial gravitational field @xmath43 with a strength proportional to the distance @xmath83 from the @xmath12-axis ; the free - falling matter particles ( at rest in the initial frame ) are moving in circular orbits with the same angular velocity @xmath13 in the new frame ( i.e.  with centripetal acceleration @xmath91 ) , so that they are rigidly rotating around the @xmath12-axis .",
    "thus , one can say that the gdel universe is rotating around the @xmath12-axis with constant angular velocity @xmath13 .",
    "and since the position of the @xmath12-axis is arbitrary ( we were free to choose the origin of the initial frame ) , gdel s universe is actually rotating around any of its points ( much like the newtonian analogue of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker solutions can be thought to be expanding about any of its points).@xcite    the rotation around any point ( which is a feature of any infinitely wide rigidly rotating cylinder ) can also be understood as follows .",
    "let @xmath92 be the position vector of an arbitrary fluid particle in @xmath4 .",
    "its equation of motion is @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "now take a particular fluid particle at position @xmath95 , and consider the reference frame @xmath6 with origin at @xmath95 that is not rotating with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the position vector of an _ arbitrary _ fluid particle in @xmath6 is , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : x - r ] ) , @xmath96 ; hence its equation of motion is @xmath97 which is formally identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : godels ] ) ( with @xmath98 ) .",
    "that is , in the frame @xmath6 the fluid is seen to be rigidly rotating about the new origin @xmath99 ( i.e. , @xmath100 in the coordinates of @xmath4 ) . since the cylinder is infinite , the picture in frame @xmath6 is indistinguishable from the picture in frame @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we see that through any point @xmath95 , rotating rigidly ( from the point of view of @xmath4 ) with an angular velocity @xmath13 about the @xmath12-axis , passes an axis of rotation for the fluid indistinguishable from the original one .    note that this symmetry in the choice of the rotation axis is not apparent in the purely newtonian form of the fields . in the newton - cartan form ,",
    "however , it is clear that the newtonian analogue of the gdel universe is spatially homogeneous .      for a rotating frame",
    "the newton - cartan coriolis field is twice the angular velocity , and so a fixed direction in an inertial frame ( say , the axis of a gyroscope ) will precess with angular velocity @xmath101 .",
    "this can also be seen starting with the equation of motion and computing the torque on a gyroscope : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the position vector with respect to the gyroscope s center of mass , @xmath19 is the gyroscope s mass density , @xmath104 is the mass current density due to the gyroscope s spinning motion , and @xmath105 the force _ density _ ( arising from the internal stresses that act on the mass elements , binding them together ) .",
    "the contribution of @xmath105 to @xmath106 is zero since the net torque of internal forces is zero .",
    "thus , assuming that the gyroscope is small enough so that the fields are constant along it , we obtain @xmath107 the first integral vanishes by definition of center of mass , and the second can be obtained from the standard computation ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 5.70 ) in ref .  ) of the torque exerted by a magnetic field @xmath108 on a magnetic dipole @xmath109 (",
    "replace the charge current and @xmath108 with the mass current and @xmath44 ) .",
    "the torque is then found to be @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the gyroscope s angular momentum .",
    "therefore , we see that @xmath111 varies as @xmath112 that is , it precesses with angular velocity @xmath113 .    the torque in eq .",
    "can be interpreted as minus the derivative with respect to @xmath114 of the `` potential energy '' @xmath115 , in analogy with the `` potential energy''@xcite @xmath116 of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field .",
    "this `` potential energy '' explains why a _",
    "gyrocompass _ ( which is essentially just a gyroscope@xcite ) tends to align itself with the earth s rotation axis : dissipation effects will drive the system towards the minimum at @xmath117 . note the similarity with the mechanism that makes a regular compass align itself with the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the similarity between eqs .",
    "and maxwell s equations is suggestive , but there are important differences : the nonlinear term @xmath118 in the third equation , plus the fact that the second equation has no sources . by analogy with electromagnetism , where magnetic effects are typically relativistic effects sourced by charge currents ( that is , of order @xmath119 , where @xmath82 is the speed of the charges and @xmath120 is the speed of light ) , one might hope to find a source for the coriolis field in general relativity .",
    "this is indeed the case .    for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the linearized theory approximation@xcite ( e.g. , refs .  ) , where one considers a metric @xmath121 that differs from the flat minkowski metric @xmath122 ( in rectangular coordinates ) only by small perturbations , @xmath123 .",
    "for our purposes it is also sufficient to consider stationary ( i.e.  time - independent ) fields , and a metric of the form @xmath124 ( which assumes @xmath125 ) .",
    "this metric describes _ any _ stationary , isolated matter distribution , accurate to linear order.@xcite as usual , we use the coordinate @xmath126 , and the notation @xmath127 for partial derivatives and @xmath128 for the christoffel symbols ( given in appendix [ sub : linearized - christoffel - symbols ] ) .",
    "latin indices @xmath129 represent spatial coordinate indices , running from 1 to 3 , whereas greek indices @xmath130 represent spacetime coordinate indices , running from 0 to 3 .",
    "we denote the covariant derivative by @xmath131 ; for instance , for a 4-vector @xmath132 , @xmath133 the linearized ricci tensor is @xmath134 , which , for the metric in eq .",

    "in this work we discussed the coriolis field in different settings ; although its effects are familiar in some situations , there exist other , seemingly mysterious phenomena , that are simply effects of a coriolis field .",
    "we started with the example of an astronaut freely falling inside a rotating ship , whose motion from the point of view of the ship frame is puzzling until one realizes the role of the coriolis field .",
    "we proceeded by showing that the coriolis field satisfies the field equations of the so - called newton - cartan theory , a generalization of newtonian theory that is covariant under changes of rigid ( arbitrarily accelerated and rotating ) frame .",

    "it is usually cast in the literature as a `` gravitomagnetic field , '' whose physical meaning  namely that it is just a coriolis field , arising from the fact that the star fixed reference frame is in fact rotating close to mass currents  is often not transparent .",
    "the lense - thirring precession of the gravity probe b mission gyroscopes is seen to come from the same principle as the newtonian precession of a gyrocompass relative to an earth - fixed frame , and both are obtained by a computation analogous to that yielding the precession of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field .",
    "the lense - thirring orbital precession of the lageos / lares satellites is also simply explained in terms of the coriolis force , analogous to the newtonian deflection of test particles in a rotating frame .",
    "thinking in terms of a coriolis field gives a correct , simple interpretation of the frame - dragging effect , avoiding the misconceptions about this effect that are all too common in the literature .",
