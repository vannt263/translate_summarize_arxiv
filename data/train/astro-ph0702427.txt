    "the structure and energetics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies are strongly influenced by stellar winds and supernovae ( e.g. , abbott 1982 ) .",
    "this is particularly true for spiral and irregular galaxies with on - going massive star formation , such as the milky way , and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) .",
    "the input of energy from winds and supernovae is expected to affect the ism on kiloparsec scales , creating regions of super - heated gas ( e.g. , norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "the @xmath5 k gas that expands into the halo of a disk galaxy may eventually cool and fall back onto the disk in a massive system , participating in a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ) ; in a low mass system , this material may escape the galaxy altogether in a galactic wind @xcite .",
    "galactic fountains and winds affect the scale over which newly produced metals are distributed in the ism of a galaxy and/or in the intergalactic medium .",
    "for example , outflows can affect the [ @xmath6/fe ] ratios inside and outside dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "gas dynamics are therefore critical in determining the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "characterising the phenomena of infall and outflow in nearby galaxies is crucial for understanding the role they may play in galaxy evolution and in the enrichment and evolution of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the lmc is the nearest gas - rich disk galaxy to our own milky way . as such",
    "it has been the target of intense studies of its interstellar medium ( ism ) , including its dust ( e.g. , meixner et al .",
    "2006 ) , its molecular gas ( tumlinson et al . 2002 ) , its warm h@xmath0i  ( kim et al .",
    "2003 ) , its warm ionised gas traced by h@xmath6 emission ( e.g. , danforth et al . 2002 ) , its warm - hot gas traced by o@xmath0vi  ( howk et al . 2002 ; danforth & blair 2006 ) , and its hot gas traced by x - rays ( e.g. , snowden & petre 1994 ) . in this work , we report observations of interstellar absorption from the li - like ions n@xmath0v , c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , and o@xmath0vi  towards stars within the lmc .",
    "these ions give us the means to study the highly - ionised material produced by feedback processes in the milky way and in the magellanic clouds .",
    "si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  peak in abundance at ( 0.6,1.0,1.8 , and 2.8)@xmath7@xmath4 k , respectively , in collisional ionisation equilibrium ( cie ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "they are , however , unlikely to be in equilibrium since these temperatures correspond to the peak of the interstellar cooling curve , and gas at those temperatures is likely to cool faster than it recombines . instead , these ions may trace interfaces between very hot gas ( @xmath8 k ) and warm or cool ( @xmath9 k ) material and serve as a probe of the interaction between the phases of the ism having the most mass ( warm / cool gas ) and the most direct connection to feedback processes ( hot gas ) .",
    "observational searches for a hot corona about the lmc using the highly ionised species started with _ iue _",
    "spectra of c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , and n@xmath0v  towards the hot star sk@xmath1067104 @xcite . however , the crude spectral resolution of _ iue _  and the fact that that the hot star could be partly responsible for producing c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv   brought @xcite to conclude these observations were not sufficient to prove the existence of a hot lmc halo ( n@xmath0v  was only marginally detected at best ) .",
    "these highly ionised species could be either produced by photoionisation from the star itself or in the superbubble via shocks .",
    "@xcite found c@xmath0iv  absorption in the spectra of cooler stars ( o9.7b1 ) using modest resolution _",
    "hst _  spectroscopy .",
    "this was the first evidence of c@xmath0iv  not related directly to local effects , as these stars were deemed unable to produce significant high - ion absorption via photoionisation .",
    "more recently , _ fuse _  has contributed to the effort of examining the hot gas in the lmc by probing diffuse o@xmath0vi  in both magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite used _ fuse _",
    "observations of sight lines to the lmc to study the o@xmath0vicontent and kinematics of the lmc .",
    "their survey of 12 sight lines through the near side of the lmc probed collisionally - ionised gas at @xmath11 k in the lmc and shows in particular that the lmc contains a significant amount of highly - ionised gas , with o@xmath0vi  column densities equal or greater than those found along extended paths through the milky way ; and much of the o@xmath0vi  in the lmc must reside in an extended `` halo '' or thick disk distribution , likely similar to that found in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "these studies of the individual highly ionised species have broadly sketched a picture of the hot gas in the lmc and the presence of coronal hot gas , but a crucial step is to combine all the available highly ionised species observed with _",
    "e140 m and _ fuse _  for a better understanding of the highly ionised gas in the lmc . in this paper",
    ", we take such a step by presenting the detailed kinematics and high - ion absorption ( o@xmath0vi , c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , and n@xmath0v ) towards four stars in the lmc using _ fuse _  and stis .",
    "two of these sight lines probe prominent superbubbles , while the other two probe h@xmath0ii  regions , allowing us to compare the highly ionised species and their connection with weaker ions towards different types of interstellar regions , which is useful for differentiating local from global effects .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . after describing the observations , data reduction , and analysis of the data ( measurements of the kinematics , column densities , and column density ratios ) in  [ sec - obs ] , we present an overview of the kinematics in  [ sec - kin ] . in",
    " [ origint ] we discuss the origin of the highly ionised plasma in the lmc and the implications of our results .",
    "a summary of the main results is presented in  [ sec - sum ] .",
    "from the data archives of _ fuse _  and _ hst_/stis e140 m , we selected four lmc targets .",
    "the selection criteria were to have the four critical highly ionised species ( si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi ) observable in the fuv and uv and to be able to model these ions without too much uncertainties ( i.e. with a continuum near the relevant ions that can be modeled without too much uncertainty ) .",
    "this resulted in the sample of the four stars presented in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "fortuitously , these stars are also located in different interstellar environments ( from chu et al .",

    "another systematic between the various sightlines is deduced from figs .",
    "[ specmodel ] and [ specmodel1 ] ( see also discussion in ",
    "[ sec - kin ] ) : cooler gas traced by si@xmath0ii  and o@xmath0i  is observed at all velocities where o@xmath0vi  absorption is detected .",
    "the close correspondence in the total velocity extent of the observed si@xmath0ii  and o@xmath0vi  absorption strongly suggests that the high and the weakly ionised species are kinematically coupled .",
    "a correspondence between o@xmath0vi  and low - ion velocity extent has also been noted in the milky way @xcite . such a relationship is expected if much or all of the o@xmath0vi  arises in interfaces between warm and hot gas .",
    "@xcite present models of conductive interfaces in such an arrangement ; they predict that if the o@xmath0vi  is found in both the evaporative and conductive stage , the o@xmath0vi  column density would be less than a few @xmath13 @xmath14 , implying that each line of sight in our work intercepts 510 interfaces .",
    "the broadening of the high - ions is consistent with such an interpretation since , if there are 510 interfaces , each component of o@xmath0vi  could still have a temperature of a few times @xmath4 k. while the low ion profiles are mostly unresolved , their velocity extents are consistent with a large number of components , and therefore with large number of interfaces .",
    "the profiles of weakly and highly ionised species cover a large enough velocity range that they are likely not simply tracing components associated directly with the h@xmath0ii  regions or superbubbles housing the target stars .",
    "thus , multiple interfaces are certainly possible and likely associated with gas out of the disk of the lmc . if conductive interfaces are the main origin for the broad component of the high ions , they have to be at least @xmath15 year old to reproduce the high - ion ratios .",
    "we note that the observed o@xmath0vi / si@xmath0iv  ratios are somewhat smaller than the ratio predicted by @xcite , but si@xmath0iv  can be easily photoionised by other sources ( e.g. , photons from stars or the absence of the incorporation of he@xmath0ii  @xmath16304 photons in the interface model that are capable of ionising efficiently si@xmath0iii see savage , sembach , & cardelli 1994 ) , and this is not taken into account in their models .",
    "the limits derived from n@xmath0v  are always consistent with the conductive interface models .",
    "it is not clear within the frame work of the conductive interface models why the high - ion ratios would be similar over the large velocity range between the lmc and hvc components , and yet so dissimilar between the observed sightlines .    in view of the complexity of the profiles and of the physical regions probed",
    ", other models may be in play , especially in the event that the apparent kinematic coupling does not imply coincidence of the highly and weakly ionised gas :     strong shocks with @xmath17 @xmath2  would produce enough o@xmath0vi  to explain the observed ratios .",
    "such strong shocks have not been inferred in the denser parts of h@xmath0ii  and superbubble regions of the lmc @xcite . but high - velocity shocks are likely to arise in low - density gas where they remain undected since they would not contribute to the nebular emission ( y .- h .",
    "chu 2006 , priv .",
    "the strong shock models are attractive because they provide a straightforward method for producing a consistent o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iv  ratio over a large range of velocities .",
    "if such strong shocks occur in the lmc , the gas traced by the lmc - ivc / hvc components could have been ejected away from the lmc in this process .    ",
    "the non - equilibrium radiative cooling model of @xcite where a gas cools from temperature of @xmath18 k fits also the data when o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iv  is greater than 5.9 .",
    "more recently , @xcite have produced new calculations of radiatively cooling gas as a function of metallicity using updated atomic data . the o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iv  and o@xmath0vi / si@xmath0iv  ratios for the hvc and lmc absorbers are consistent with the gnat & sternberg models of radiative cooling from @xmath19 k for models with metallicities 0.1 to 1.0 times solar .",
    "the gas must still be at temperatures between @xmath20 k in order to match their models",
    ". a radiative cooling model for the origins of the highly - ionised gas in the hvc and lmc components would be consistent with an outflow and infall of highly ionised material from the disk of the lmc , i.e. , an exchange of matter between the thin disk of the lmc and its halo or thick disk .",
    "the majority of the gas must cool in the outflow phase since we only find evidence for the possible infall of material towards one sight line .",
    "if we combine our sample with that of @xcite , only 3 of 14 sight lines show possible evidence for infalling material .",
    "it is , however , not clear within the framework of this model why velocities of the cool and hotter gas would be systematically coincident .    in summary , the physical origins of o@xmath0vi  and broad c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv   are tangled and several processes could occur .",
    "however , it is apparent that conducting heating processes play a fundamental role in the production of the highly ionised species probing gas at @xmath21 k while tmls are not important in the probed regions in the hvc - lmc , except if a large fraction of o@xmath0vi  is produced via another mechanism ( e.g. , radiative cooling ) .",
    "we note that @xcite found that the o@xmath0vi  column densities appear higher by about 0.2 dex in the n70 superbubble and other superbubbles described by @xcite compared to some more quiescent h@xmath0ii  region sight lines , suggesting the very local environment of the background stars may affect the total column of o@xmath0vi  along a sight line . in this context",
    ", they argued that superbubbles were significant contributors to the total o@xmath0vi  observed along lmc sight lines .",
    "8 shows an h@xmath6 image of the lmc from @xcite with a representation of all available o@xmath0vicolumn densities superimposed ( including * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) .",
    "table  [ t7 ] summarises the measured columns and the surrounding environments for each _ fuse_measurement .",
    "all of the superbubble sight lines are concentrated below the line superimposed on the image ( we display only the average of the four measurements towards n70 ) .",
    "while some superbubble - type regions may have slight enhancements in o@xmath0vi , what is striking about this figure is the very large local variations , as reported by @xcite .",
    "for example the pairs of stars labeled 12 & 13 ( sk@xmath1067211 & bi  237 ) and 18 & 19 ( bi  272 and sk@xmath1067266 ) trace h@xmath0ii  regions where the column densities varies by a factor 2 from 14.1 to 14.4 dex .",
    "these pairs have projected separations of 90 and 129 pc , respectively .",
    "this is the degree of enhancement @xcite identify with superbubbles , but over much smaller angular scales than those authors use for comparison between superbubble and non - superbubble sight lines .",
    "furthermore quiescent regions like stars no . 2 , 5 , and 17 have o@xmath0vicolumn densities similar or larger than observed in some superbubbles .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath23 is large along superbubble sight lines , as well .",
    "the measurements of @xmath22o@xmath0vi ) appear not to be smaller than 14.3 dex in the superbubbles .",
    "however , many more o@xmath0vimeasurements will be needed in the lmc before one can truly determine if the superbubbles and other very local phenomena have a strong impact on the observed total o@xmath0vi  column density .",
    "it is clear that the o@xmath0vi  has a patchy distribution in the lmc , and comparisons between sight lines separated by tens of parsecs may not lead to significant results in this regard .",
    "while the high - ion ratios vary from sight line to sight line , there is no clear link between the observed variation and the regions associated with the lines of sight .",
    "the comparison of high - ion ratios is potentially a more secure indicator of the impact of the local effects because it is not subject to the varying depth of the gas probed by the background stars , which may be part of the source of the observed variations in @xmath22o@xmath0vi ) .",
    "we analyse the physical properties of the highly ionised species ( c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , o@xmath0vi ) in and around the lmc towards a sample of 4 lmc hot stars .",
    "two of these sight lines probe prominent superbubbles , while the other two probe h@xmath0ii  regions , allowing us to compare the highly ionised species and their connection with weakly ionised species among different regions .",
    "o@xmath0vi  was obtained with _",
    "fuse _ with a spectral resolution of @xmath2420 @xmath2 , and the other highly ionised species were observed with the _",
    "e140 m setup with a spectral resolution of @xmath247 @xmath2 . the excellent spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise of these data have allowed us to model the highly ionised species in the lmc .",
    "our main findings are summarised as follows :    \\(i ) absorption from both the high and low ionisation species are observed over the entire range of velocities from the milky way to lmc ( @xmath25 @xmath2 ) . along our four sight lines ,",
    "the profiles are separated into four principal components : the mw ( @xmath26 @xmath2 ) , ivc ( @xmath27 @xmath2 ) , hvc ( @xmath28 @xmath2 ) , and lmc ( @xmath29 @xmath2 ) .",
    "n@xmath0v  is not detected at the 3@xmath30 level .",
    "\\(ii ) in the lmc component , we find narrow and broad absorption in c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv , but only very broad o@xmath0vi  absorption .",
    "the narrow lmc components of c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv   have an observed @xmath31-value that implies temperatures of a few times @xmath32 k or less .",
    "the properties of the narrow components of c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv  can be principally explained by the interstellar environment associated with the stars , in particular h@xmath0ii  regions around the central star and expanding shells behind the shocked plasma .",
    "\\(iii ) the o@xmath0vi  at lmc velocities is broader than the o@xmath0vi  absorption observed in the combined milky way and ivc component , implying that the lmc o@xmath0vi  profiles are composed of several components . the broad lmc components of o@xmath0vi , c@xmath0iv , and si@xmath0iv   likely probe gas of a few times @xmath4",
    "k.    \\(iv ) we find a striking similarity in the o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iv  ratios for the lmc and hvc components ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) along a given sight line , but the o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iv  ratios for the hvc and lmc gas vary between the sight lines ( see fig .",
    "the fact that the ratios in the hvc and lmc components along a given sight line are always very similar suggests that the hvc component has its origins in the lmc , and the processes producing the highly - ionised gas in the lmc affect a large range of velocities along a given sight line .",
    "\\(v ) the difference in the high - ion ratios between the four sight lines implies different processes or varying conditions may produce the highly ionised species in the lmc .",
    "there is no evidence , however , of a link between the observed variation and the regions associated with the stars , although it is likely that some of the o@xmath0vi  absorption occurs because of stellar winds or other phenomena associated with the stellar environment .",
    "conductive interface model can reproduce both the high - ion ratios observed in the broad component and the apparent kinematically coupling between o@xmath0vi  and the weakly ionised species such as si@xmath0ii  and o@xmath0i .",
    "\\(vi ) the velocities of the lmc - ivc and hvc components indicate that they are expanding away from the warm disk gas . only towards one line of sight",
    "is there evidence for both significant red - shifted and blue - shifted components in the low- and high - ion spectra , implying little of the material we observe is returning to the lmc disk .",
    "our analysis therefore provides compelling evidence for a hot lmc halo fed by energetic outflows from the lmc disk and even possibly with a galactic wind since the velocity of the hvc relative to the lmc disk is actually large enough to escape the lmc .",
