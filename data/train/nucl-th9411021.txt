    "with increasing experimental information about the different members of the meson spectrum it becomes more and more important to develop a consistent understanding of the observed mesons from a theoretical point of view .",
    "for the low lying pseudoscalar , vector and tensor mesons this has been done quite successfully within the framework of the simple quark model assuming the mesons to be quark - antiquark ( @xmath7 ) states grouped together into nonets . for the scalar mesons , however , several questions still remain to be answered , most of them being related to the nature of the experimentally observed mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in a long standing controversial discussion",
    "the @xmath0 has been described as , for example , a conventional @xmath7 meson @xcite , a @xmath8 molecule @xcite or a multiquark state @xcite . in order to discriminate between different models morgan and pennington",
    "@xcite recently investigated new data on the decay @xmath6 @xcite concluding that a conventional breit - wigner ( i.e.  @xmath7 ) structure is most probable for the @xmath0 .",
    "they claim that the @xmath11 amplitude is characterized by two poles near the @xmath8 threshold on the @xmath12 $ ] ( second ) and @xmath13 $ ] ( third ) sheet ( see ref .",

    "ii for sheet structure and notation ) . in the jlich model of the @xmath2 interaction",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 appears to be a pure @xmath8 bound state generated dynamically by vector - meson exchange .",
    "such a state has only one nearby pole on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet , a structure seemingly disfavored by the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by zou and bugg @xcite that a model with only one nearby @xmath12 $ ] sheet pole ( similar to a @xmath8 bound state ) but a very broad @xmath13 $ ] sheet pole is also compatible with the @xmath14 data .",
    "we have therefore fitted this data with the @xmath11 amplitude resulting from our meson - exchange model and obtained a description comparable in quality with those of the alternative models discussed above .",
    "this seems to support very recent developments @xcite that @xmath14 decay may no longer be regarded as the crucial discriminant for the structure of the @xmath0 .",
    "what turns out to be quite different in our analysis is the rather large mass ( interpreted as the pole position ) of the @xmath0 ( @xmath15 gev , see sec .",
    "iii ) which is a consequence of its @xmath8 bound state nature in combination with a rather strong coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath8 channels .",
    "while there has been considerable discussion in the literature concerning the width of the @xmath0@xcite , there seems to be a consensus that the mass lies between 0.97 and 1.0 gev .",
    "interestingly , our value for the mass is somewhat larger than this due to the strong influence of the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "closely related to the @xmath0 is the @xmath1 which is observed in the @xmath3 channel . both mesons couple to the @xmath8 channel and",
    "their masses lie very close to the @xmath8 threshold . as with the @xmath0 ,",
    "the nature of the @xmath1 is still under discussion , especially since the available experimental information about @xmath3 scattering is rather poor compared to @xmath2 scattering @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emerge from a non - relativistic quark model calculation to be degenerate @xmath8 bound states .",
    "however , while the jlich model of the @xmath2 interaction comes to the same conclusion for the @xmath0 the situation turns out to be rather different for the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath8 interaction generated by vector - meson exchange , which for isospin @xmath16 is strong enough to generate a bound state , is much weaker for @xmath17 making a degeneracy of @xmath1 and @xmath0 impossible .",
    "it is therefore one aim of this paper to address the question of whether the close relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 expressed by their similar properties ( masses , proximity to @xmath8 threshold , etc . )",
    "can be understood in the framework of our meson - exchange model . by extending the @xmath2 model consistently to the @xmath3 system",
    "we find that this is indeed possible .",
    "we obtain a model where both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 originate from the coupling to the @xmath8 channel .",
    "however , the underlying structure turns out to be quite different .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 , the @xmath1 would not appear to be a @xmath8 bound state but a dynamically generated threshold effect with a relatively broad pole on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet .",
    "we find poles responsible for the observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 at complex energies @xmath18  mev and @xmath19  mev respectively . despite such different pole positions ,",
    "the observed position and width of the structure in the cross sections turn out to be rather similar .",
    "this is directly attributable to the proximity of the @xmath8 threshold at 991  mev .",

    "( [ scaeq ] ) below , so the bare couplings and bare masses are adjusted to reproduce experimental data in the appropriate partial waves .",
    "all remaining coupling constants are determined from su(3 ) symmetry relations , and standard assumptions about the octet / singlet mixing angles , as demonstrated in ref.@xcite ( see tables [ tab : tparams ] and [ tab : sparams ] ) .",

    "the spin - momentum structure of this potential is given by the same general expression for the interaction between two pseudoscalar particles which has been derived for the @xmath2 interaction ( see ref.@xcite and appendix a ) .",
    "the potential corresponding to fig.[figiifour ] is obtained by using the appropriate coupling constants and isospin factors ( tables [ tab : tparams ] and [ tab : isofactors ] ) and the bbs off - shell prescription for different - mass particles ( appendix a ) .",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath79 is related by su(3 ) symmetry to @xmath33 , the entire @xmath3 @xmath49-matrix is obtained with the addition of only one new parameter , the cutoff mass @xmath80 .    the @xmath3 scattering amplitude @xmath49 and the location of its poles follow from exactly the same formalism as was developed for the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "since the @xmath28 and @xmath32 @xmath26-channel exchanges were found to be negligible , this model does not include any direct @xmath81 potential .",
    "having specified all of the relevant formalism , we first look at elastic @xmath2 scattering where we essentially reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite within our modified model .",
    "figure [ figiiione ] shows the result of our fit to experimental data for the @xmath82 ( @xmath20 ) partial wave as well as for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the complete set of parameters given in tables [ tab : tparams][tab : barem ] .",
    "as could be expected from refs.@xcite we obtain quite good overall agreement with the experimental situation .",
    "the quality of the total fit obtained with a relatively small number of parameters demonstrates the validity of the model .",
    "in particular we note that @xmath26-channel @xmath31 exchange is the sole contributor to @xmath83 and @xmath86 , and , as can be seen in the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ figiiione ] , provides a substantial part of the low energy @xmath82 interaction .",
    "this suggests that the spin - isospin structure provided by the @xmath26-channel meson exchanges arising from a lagrangian with effective meson degrees of freedom is substantively correct",
    ".    in particular we are able to describe the structure appearing around 1.0 gev in the isoscalar @xmath2 s - wave which is assigned to the @xmath20 meson . in our model",
    "this resonance like behavior is generated dynamically by the strong attraction arising from @xmath31 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 exchange in the @xmath8 channel and we therefore do _ not _ need a genuine scalar resonance with mass around 1.0 gev .",
    "this is demonstrated for @xmath89 by the dashed line in fig.[figiiione ] where we have excluded the @xmath25-channel @xmath28 pole diagram . on the other hand , it is definitely necessary to include a heavy scalar particle , namely the @xmath28 with mass around 1.4 gev , to describe the experimental data beyond 1.0 gev ( see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ figiiione ] ) .",
    "this particle may be interpreted as the member of the scalar nonet ; i.e. , it effectively parameterizes the effect of both the isoscalar singlet and octet contributions and any other higher mass states present in the scalar - isoscalar spectrum . for smaller energies ( @xmath90 gev )",
    "the @xmath2 s - wave is characterized by a sizable phase shift dominantly generated by @xmath26-channel @xmath31 exchange .",
    "the corresponding attraction between the two pions forms a broad background to the @xmath20 ( dotted curve in fig.[figiiione ] ) .",
    "having obtained a model which is able to describe experimental data on elastic @xmath2 scattering , we are now in a position to discuss the pole positions of the scattering amplitude in the isoscalar @xmath2 s - wave .    looking at smaller energies first , we find a very broad pole on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet at complex energy @xmath91  mev and its shadow - pole counterpart@xcite on the @xmath13 $ ] sheet at @xmath92  mev ( see table  [ tab : poles ] ) . at vanishing @xmath11 coupling this pole is found on both @xmath8 sheets at the same position but when the coupling is increased they move apart .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[figiiitwo ] where we turned off the @xmath11 coupling gradually , thus proving that we have really found a pole and its corresponding shadow pole .",
    "this shows that these poles are generated by the strong @xmath26-channel @xmath31 exchange in the @xmath22 potential .",
    "the pole closest to the physical region , namely the one on @xmath12 $ ] , is the origin of the large @xmath2 s - wave phase shifts below 1.0 gev ( see @xmath89 in fig.[figiiione ] ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite we denote it @xmath93 .",
    "we find an additional pair of connected poles at lower energies ( re(@xmath94)@xmath95500 mev ) on sheets @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] indicating that this time the origin is the direct @xmath8 interaction .",
    "however , since both @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] poles are far away from the physical region they do not have any effect on physical observables and are therefore quite unimportant for the present investigation .",
    "looking at higher energies , we find the poles generated by the @xmath28 @xmath25-channel diagram necessary to describe data above 1.0 gev . including exclusively this diagram and turning off the @xmath11 coupling a pole",
    "is found at @xmath97  mev on @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] sheets ( fig .",
    "[ figiiithree ] , point a ) .",
    "the @xmath26-channel contributions to the @xmath2 potential shift both poles to point b of fig .",
    "[ figiiithree ] before they move apart when the @xmath11 coupling is increased .",
    "whereas the physically unimportant @xmath12 $ ] pole moves to very high energies the @xmath13 $ ] pole is finally found at @xmath98  mev ( see table  [ tab : poles ] ) .",
    "this pole , lying closest to the physical region , defines the parameters of the genuine scalar particle which effectively includes the singlet and the octet member of the scalar nonet .",
    "we denote it by @xmath99 although it is more likely an effective parameterization of two scalar resonances , such as @xmath99 and @xmath100 . both poles , @xmath93 and",
    "@xmath99 form a background to the @xmath0 .",
    "a similar structure has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we investigate the energy region around the @xmath8 threshold and find a single pole on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet at @xmath19  mev which clearly has to be assigned to the @xmath20 meson and to the corresponding structure in @xmath2 phase shifts and inelasticities .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath101    in the zero @xmath11 coupling limit the pole moves back to @xmath102  mev ( i.e. , on the real axis and below the @xmath8 threshold ) and appears on sheets @xmath103 $ ] and @xmath12 $ ] ( see fig.[figiiifour ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates the bound state nature of the @xmath20 within our model .",
    "compared to other models @xcite we find a rather high mass ( when interpreted as the pole position ) for the @xmath20 .",
    "this is a consequence of the relatively strong coupling between the @xmath2 and @xmath8 channels which moves the pole from the real axis to its final position .",
    "a similar movement of a bound state pole to energies above the corresponding threshold was already found in ref.@xcite and as the strength of the @xmath11 coupling is constrained by the fit to experimental data , the relatively high mass seems to be a more general feature of our bound state model for the @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the pole is on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet and above the @xmath8 threshold means that its effect will be seen most strongly at the threshold .",
    "this can be seen in , for example , the partial wave cross section which is shown in fig.[fig : f0crosssection ] .",
    "the most evident feature is the strong dip in the cross section which occurs precisely at the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "there is no structure evident near the pole at @xmath19  mev .",
    "clearly it is insufficient to simply quote the mass parameters of the @xmath0 without describing in detail how the threshold is incorporated since the two are inextricably linked .    for completeness",
    ", we finally look at the @xmath31 ( @xmath104 ) channel .",
    "as could be expected we observe a pole on the @xmath12 $ ] sheet and an unimportant shadow pole on the @xmath13 $ ] sheet with the position of the former found at @xmath105  mev .",
    "the deviation from the usually given breit - wigner parameters ( @xmath106 mev ; @xmath10776 mev ) is due to the existence of a non - pole background generated by the @xmath26-channel diagrams .",
    "so far we have discussed a model for @xmath2 scattering which is able to produce quite satisfactory agreement with experimental data and leads to a @xmath8 bound state structure for the @xmath20 meson .",
    "however , as was discussed in the introduction , it has been pointed out by morgan and pennington @xcite that information on elastic @xmath2 scattering is not sufficient to discriminate between alternative models for the structure of the @xmath20 . whereas they claim that the decay @xmath108 demands two poles nearby the @xmath8 threshold on sheets @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ]",
    ", zou and bugg @xcite recently found that a solution with only one nearby @xmath12 $ ] pole is also compatible with the experimental situation .",
    "the latter model contains an additional @xmath13 $ ] sheet pole but since its position is far away from @xmath8 threshold the pole structure is similar to those of our @xmath8 bound state model .",
    "figure [ figiiifive ] shows the result of our fit to the @xmath14 decay data from dm2 @xcite and mk3 @xcite .",
    "the fit was obtained using @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : params ] ) ) ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 are dimensionless while @xmath112 and @xmath113 are in gev@xmath114 ) .",
    "the fit demonstrates that our model is able to reproduce this data quite well .",
    "moreover , the quality of the fit is strictly comparable in quality with those of alternative models @xcite leading to the conclusion that the bound state structure of the @xmath20 is not disfavored by the @xmath14 criterion .",
    "this finding is in agreement with a very recent development calling into question the role of the @xmath14 decay as a crucial discriminant between different models for the @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "next we turn our attention to the @xmath3 channel and the structure of the @xmath21 .",
    "it was already pointed out that we want to extend the concepts applied to the @xmath2 interaction _ consistently _ to the @xmath3 system ; therefore , the @xmath8 interaction required for a @xmath115 coupled - channel approach is taken to be exactly the same as for the @xmath2 case ( projected now onto isospin @xmath17 ) . however , as can be seen from tables  [ tab : tparams ] and [ tab : isofactors ] , the important @xmath31 exchange between two kaons becomes repulsive for isospin @xmath116=1 destroying the @xmath8 bound state we found for @xmath116=0 . to illustrate this we considered only the direct @xmath8 interaction and gradually changed the isospin factor for @xmath31 exchange from @xmath117 to 1 .",

    "although the preceding remarks rule out a @xmath8 bound - state ( or anti - bound state ) structure for the @xmath21 our consistent meson exchange framework allows us to proceeded anyway to construct a model for @xmath3 scattering as described in section ii .",
    "as already noted , only one additional parameter is needed , namely the cutoff mass @xmath80 .",
    "before we discuss our results some remarks should be made concerning the available experimental information which , in contrast to the @xmath2 interaction , is rather poor for the @xmath3 case .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath21 have been derived indirectly from the mass spectra of relatively complicated processes like @xmath118@xcite and recent values obtained from conventional breit - wigner fits are @xmath119 we note that there would still appear to be some uncertainty concerning the width of the @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , the particle data group@xcite choose to exclude the results of ref.@xcite from their averaged width .",
    "this seems surprising since ( a ) it was derived from a larger event sample than any of the values they did include , ( b ) it is from a more recent publication than any value included , the most recent value included being ten years older , and ( c ) they _ did _ include the results of ref.@xcite in their mass average .",
