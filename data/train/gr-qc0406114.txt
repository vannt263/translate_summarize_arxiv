    "there seems to be a striking bias between the particle number density as inferred from the stress - energy tensor of a scalar field in an expanding universe and the response of an unruh detector . for particle energies",

    "the particle number found from the transformed creation and annihilation operators is then also proportional to @xmath2 , in disagreement with the detector response at first order in perturbation theory , which is due to the fact that the incoming vacuum state is of purely negative frequency , while this does not hold for the outgoing vacuum .",
    "in fact , the problem does not occur for the celebrated hawking effect  @xcite , the emission of radiation with thermal spectrum by a black hole .",
    "for an observer far from a black hole , the background space is asymptotically flat , and the canonical hamiltonian agrees with the stress - energy tensor . the hamiltonian is diagonal in the basis where a positive frequency mode corresponds to a particle and negative frequency to an antiparticle .",
    "the particle number can be observed by an unruh detector  @xcite , which interacts under these circumstances with the scalar field through the familiar processes of absorption , spontaneous and stimulated emission , calculated at first order in time - dependent perturbation theory , which we review in section  [ section : unruhflat ] .",
    "it hence counts the number of positive frequency modes as particles , and there is no conflict with the result obtained from the bogolyubov transformation .    in order to resolve the disagreement for the expanding universe case , it is pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that , instead of diagonalizing the hamiltonian , one can obtain a bogolyubov transformation related to a thermal spectrum by matching the modes of the scalar field to a certain basis defined in static coordinates .",

    "we point out that in expanding space - times , it is not suitable to describe scalar particle creation and detection by a mixing of positive and negative frequency modes .",
    "the main source for the detector response in the ultraviolet domain is rather given by the pair creation amplitude of the scalar hamiltonian .",

    "we have shown that the most important source for the response of an unruh detector coupled to a scalar field in an expaning universe arises at second adiabatic order .",
    "it corresponds to the particle number obtained from diagonalizing the hamiltonian , which agrees for minimal coupling to the curvature with the number density as inferred from the stress - energy tensor .",
    "thus , the latter quantity is observable by a detector , which questions the usual approach to stress - energy renormalization and suggests instead a regularization by a physical cutoff .",
    "the ultraviolet contributions at second adiabatic order might then cause a considerable back - reaction on the expansion rate .",

    "it is therefore conceivable , that @xmath164 was varying throughout the history of the universe , in particular at structure formation , when particle densities , which possibly disturb particle production in the expanding background , dropped drastically in the intergalactic voids .",
    "if today , @xmath165 , gravitation on cosmological scales might even be repulsive , such that the change in @xmath164 would lead to cosmic acceleration , providing thus an explanation for recent observations  @xcite , without resorting to a cosmological term or an effective field theoretical description arising _",
    "e.g. _ from fields like quintessence .",
    "finally , we point out that our results of section  [ section : unruhexpanding ] apparently disagree with the notion that the particle spectrum a detector observes in de sitter space is thermal .",
    "the detector response does not fall exponentially with the particle energy but rather , just like the energy density , as a power law , as indicated by the expressions  ( [ t : adiabatic ] ) and  ( [ omega : adiabatic ] ) .",
    "the analysis here is restricted to particle momenta larger than the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that at first order in time - dependent perturbation theory , also for modes comparable to horizon length and larger , the detector response significantly deviates from a thermal answer .",
    "therefore , on all momentum scales , an observer in de sitter space does not see thermal radiation , a conclusion which is a consequence of the reconciliation of unruh s detector response with the stress - energy of a scalar field in an expanding universe .",

    "<S> we consider the response of an unruh detector to scalar fields in an expanding space - time . </S>",
    "<S> when combining transition elements of the scalar field hamiltonian with the interaction operator of detector and field , one finds at second order in time - dependent perturbation theory a transition amplitude , which actually dominates in the ultraviolet over the first order contribution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the detector response faithfully reproduces the particle number implied by the stress - energy of a minimally coupled scalar field , which is inversely proportional to the energy of a scalar mode . </S>",
    "<S> this finding disagrees with the contention that in de sitter space , the response of the detector drops exponentially with particle energy and therefore indicates a thermal spectrum . </S>"
