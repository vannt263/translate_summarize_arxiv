    "both observational and theoretical evidence indicates that classical be stars are near main sequence b - type stars with gaseous circumstellar disks ( e.g. see review by @xcite ) ; however , the mechanism(s ) responsible for creating these disks are not well understood .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies have uncovered a myriad of different line profile morphologies commonly observed in classical be stars @xcite , including double - peaked asymmetrical emission lines @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the violet ( v ) to red ( r ) flux within individual lines , hereafter referred to as a v / r ratio , is observed to vary on quasi - periodic timescales of several to ten years , as documented for a large set of be stars by @xcite .",
    "while numerous theories have been proposed to explain this observed phenomenon , as summarized within @xcite , these features are most commonly interpreted as evidence of one - armed density waves within these circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "note however that the presence of phase lags between polarimetric and h@xmath1 observations has led @xcite to suggest these waves might be more spiral - like than previously thought .",
    "interferometric studies @xcite have also provided evidence that be disks deviate from axisymmetry , namely they have provided evidence of prograde one - armed oscillations in several disks .",
    "it is not uncommon to observe multiple emission lines in a spectrum of a classical be star that exhibit a v / r asymmetry , and with few exceptions the same orientation of this asymmetry is observed in all lines .",
    "@xcite summarizes several of these exceptions , in which a phase lag appears to be present between optical hydrogen and fe ii lines @xcite and between different lines in the hydrogen balmer series @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested that a phase lag exists between the h@xmath1 and hydrogen pa 15 - 18 lines of @xmath4 cas presented by @xcite ; however , we believe this suggestion is rather dubious given the poor resolution of these data and clear evidence of contamination from nearby lines .",
    "few moderate resolution infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic studies of classical be stars have been performed to date . @xcite and @xcite have investigated a large set of be stars in the h and k band at sufficient resolution to begin to search for detailed line profile effects .",
    "the first tentative evidence of ir v / r reversals , analogous to the optical v / r phase lags summarized by @xcite , was presented in @xcite , who noted that the brackett @xmath4 and he i 2.058@xmath5 m lines had opposite orientations in one of their targets .    in this letter , we present the initial results from a near - contemporaneous , optical and ir spectroscopic observing campaign designed to provide insight into the detailed density structure of classical be circumstellar disks , hence diagnose the mechanisms responsible for creating these disks . detailed modeling of these data , as well as follow - up observations , will be presented in subsequent papers . in section 2",
    "we outline the observational data to be discussed in this work .",
    "an analysis and discussion of these data are presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , a summary of our main results and suggested follow - up work is presented in section 4 .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic data presented in this paper were obtained at the 3 m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) , using the spex medium resolution spectrograph @xcite .",
    "we used a 0.3 x 15 arc - second slit to provide wavelength coverage from 0.8 - 2.4@xmath5 m at r @xmath62000 .",
    "observations of a0v stars were obtained at @xmath615 minute intervals throughout our run , at a similar hour angle and airmass to our science targets , to serve as telluric standards .",
    "further details regarding the telluric correction method commonly applied to spex data are presented in @xcite .",
    "all observations were reduced using spextool @xcite .",
    "these data were taken during a period of extremely poor weather conditions on mauna kea , thus we have not attempted to perform a rigorous flux calibration . while these observing conditions did introduce small artifacts in wavelength regimes outside of those presented here ( see @xcite ) , we are fully confident that the line profile morphologies and line - to - continuum ratios of the data presented in this paper are not influenced by the presence of any residual telluric features .",
    "the optical spectroscopic data presented here were obtained at the 1 m telescope of the ritter observatory , using its fiber - fed echelle spectrograph .",
    "nine non - overlapping orders , each of width 70  , were obtained over the wavelength range 5300 - 6600  at r @xmath626000 .",
    "standard iraf techniques were used to reduce these data , including procedures to apply bias , flat field , and wavelength calibration corrections to all data .",
    "further details regarding the reduction of ritter data can be found in @xcite .",
    "a summary of the optical and ir data to be discussed in this paper are presented in table [ photsummary ] .",
    "note that we have not corrected any of our optical or ir spectral line data for underlying photospheric absorption components .",
    "as demonstrated by our near - contemporaneous optical and ir observations of 48 librae ( see figure [ 48lib ] ) , double - peaked asymmetrical profiles in be spectra often exhibit the same v / r orientation for all observed transitions .",
    "@xcite reported phase lags between optical fe ii and hydrogen lines in several of his observations of be stars ; we found evidence of a similar phenomenon in our ir observation of the suggested classical be star ngc 2439:wbbe1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained two h@xmath1 spectra of the well studied classical be star @xmath3 tau ( see figure [ ztauoptical ] ) one month before and one month after our ir observations , and note that both h@xmath1 profiles exhibit triple - peaked profiles characterized by an overall v @xmath2 r asymmetry .",
    "the v / r period is often several years , so the line profiles are generally stable on timescales of several months @xcite .",
    "we are confident that @xmath3 tau exhibited a h@xmath1 profile similar to that shown in figure [ ztauoptical ] at the time of our ir observation , and was not in the midst of a cycle of irregular fluctuations of the type described by @xcite , based on our long baseline of previous observations of the star . at the resolution of spex ,",
    "@xmath3 tau s ir spectrum shows many emission - lines characterized by a range of morphologies , including single - peaked profiles , asymmetrical double - peaked profiles , and asymmetrical double - peaked shell profiles . as shown in figure [ ztauoptical ] , hydrogen brackett transitions in these data exhibit shell - like profiles , which are asymmetrical with v @xmath0 r. other ir emission - lines which have asymmetrical profiles with a similar v / r orientation to the h i brackett series include o i 0.8446 , 1.129 , 1.317 @xmath5 m ; fe ii 1.086 , 1.113 @xmath5 m ; he i 1.083 @xmath5 m ; h i paschen @xmath4 and @xmath7 ; and the h i pfund lines at 2.382 , 2.392 , 2.403 @xmath5 m .",
    "these data exhibit a fundamentally different v / r morphology than our near - contemporaneous h@xmath1 profile .    as @xmath3 tau is known to experience cyclical v / r variations , likely due to the presence of a density wave in its disk @xcite",
    ", we suggest that the observed opposite v / r orientation of the ir lines and h@xmath1 can be explained by the presence of a density wave in the disk which has a significantly different average azimuthal morphology ( e.g. a spiral wave ) , combined with different loci for line formation .",
    "this idea is illustrated in figure [ diagram ] , where we show schematically the disk of @xmath3 tau with a one - armed spiral density perturbation : note that lighter shading denotes regions of density enhancement while darker shading denotes density decrements .",
    "the h i ir lines are much more optically thin than the optical lines , hence they form within the inner disk , while the optical h i lines originate from a much larger area . as a result of the different azimuthal properties of the disk with respect to the distance from the star , in certain phases of the v / r cycle the net density enhancement of",
    "the inner disk may occur in an opposite side ( with respect to the line of sight ) to the net density enhancement of the entire disk , thus producing line profiles with opposite v / r ratios .",
    "for instance , in figure [ diagram ] the v @xmath0 r morphology of br-12 is produced by a net density enhancement in the inner disk region which is moving towards the observer , and the v @xmath2 r morphology of h@xmath1 is produced by a net density enhancement in the outer disk region which is moving away from the observer .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite outline a new monte carlo code for solving the radiative transfer in the circumstellar disks of be stars .",
    "this fully three - dimensional non - lte monte carlo code produces a self - consistent determination of the hydrogen level populations , electron temperature , and gas density of a circumstellar disk , given a prescription of the central star and assuming a static , nearly - keplerian disk with a given mass loss rate , truncation radius , and a prescription for the gas viscosity . in @xcite",
    ", the authors used this code to study the circumstellar disk of @xmath3 tau .",
    "following @xcite , they adopted a luminosity class of iv and a spectral type of @xmath8 , which corresponds to an effective temperature of @xmath9 and a stellar radius of @xmath10 . assuming an outer disk radius of @xmath11 and a mass loss rate of @xmath12 the authors were able to fit the observed sed from visible to mid ir wavelengths , and optical ( @xmath13 320010500  ) spectropolarimetry . using this model , we calculated intensity maps of h@xmath1 and br-12 for @xmath3 tau which , as seen in figure [ allmodel ] , illustrate that br-12 is formed in the inner disk ( @xmath14 ) whereas h@xmath1 is produced over a much more extended region , thereby confirming our previous assertion that our optical versus ir h i data probe distinctly different disk regions .",
    "future iterations of the model will incorporate complex density profiles , such as one - armed waves , which will enable us to test our exploratory discussion in a more quantitatve manner .",
    "we note that v / r reversals have been predicted by at least one other theory in the refereed literature .",
    "@xcite predicted instances in which a ratio of r@xmath0v in a h@xmath1 line would reverse to a ratio of r@xmath2v in ir h i lines , due to line self - absorption in the inner region of edge - on disks .",
    "however , the presence of this reversal depends critically on the existence of a large expansion component in the disk velocity at the location where the lines form , an unlikely scenario given the very small radial velocities now believed to characterize inner disk regions @xcite .",
    "we have presented the first results of near - contemporaneous optical and ir spectroscopic observations of classical be stars .",
    "we report the discovery of asymmetrical infrared emission lines ( he i , o i , fe ii , h i paschen , brackett , and pfund series ) in @xmath3 tau which have oppositely oriented v / r ratios to that seen at h@xmath1 .",
    "we suggest these data indicate that the density wave which characterizes @xmath3 tau s disk has a significantly different average azimuthal morphology in the inner disk region as compared to its outer disk region .",
    "this would also indicate that the fe ii lines are formed in the inner disk , in the same spatial location as the ir lines are formed .",
    "these features should travel through the disk on the cyclical timescale generally reported for density waves in @xmath3 tau @xcite ; hence , we would predict continued anti - correlation amongst these line profiles over the course of several observing seasons .",
    "we have begun a long - term optical and ir spectroscopic monitoring program to trace this evolution .",
    "as demonstrated by the initial results presented in this letter , such an observational approach has the potential to provide powerful constraints to theoretical efforts to map the detailed density distribution of be circumstellar disks , hence better understand the mechanism(s ) which create these disks .",
