    "widely used model of @xmath0 noise interprets the spectrum as a superposition of lorentzians with a wide range distribution of relaxation times @xcite . another possibility to model signals and processes featuring @xmath5 noise",
    "is a representation of the signals as consisting of the renewal pulses or events with the power - law distribution of the inter - event time @xcite .",

    "in addition , the exponent @xmath3 is exactly @xmath4 in the spectrum of fluctuations of mass in a one - dimensional directed model of sandpiles @xcite .    in most cases",
    "the @xmath0 noise is a gaussian process @xcite , however sometimes @xmath0 fluctuations are non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "processes with the power - law distributions of the signal characteristics can be modeled by presuming that the time between the adjacent pulses experience slow ( the change from one inter - pulse duration to the next much smaller than the duration itself ) brownian - like motion @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) generating @xmath5 noise have been obtained and analyzed @xcite starting from this point process model .",
    "sde generating @xmath0 noise should necessarily be nonlinear , because systems of linear sdes do not generate signals with @xmath0 spectrum .",

    "we briefly present this model and obtain the psd of the signal using a different method than the method used in @xcite .",
    "the new method allows us better estimate the frequency range where the psd has @xmath0 behavior .",
    "let us consider a signal consisting of a pulse sequence having correlated inter - pulse durations .",
    "we assume that : ( i ) the pulse sequences are stationary and ergodic ; ( ii ) all pulses are described by the same shape function @xmath16 .",
    "the general form of the signal can be written as @xmath17 where the functions @xmath16 determine the shape of the individual pulse and time moments @xmath18 determine when the pulse occurs .",
    "inter - pulse duration is @xmath19 .",
    "such a pulse sequence is schematically shown in .",
    ".,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the psd of such a signal is given by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the observation time and the brackets @xmath22 denote the averaging over realizations of the pulse sequence .",
    "note that in equation we consider one - sided psd , thus we have multiplier @xmath23 in it . introducing the fourier",
    "transform @xmath24 of the pulse shape function @xmath16 , we can write equation as @xmath25 here @xmath26 .",
    "if the pulses are narrow and we are considering low frequencies then the fourier transform @xmath24 of the pulse shape is almost constant . in this case",
    "we can replace the actual pulses with @xmath27-functions and drop @xmath24 in the equations .",
    "the psd can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath28 the first term can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean number of pulses per unit time . by changing @xmath31 into @xmath32",
    "in the second part of the psd one sees that it can be expressed as @xmath33 where the time difference @xmath34 is @xmath35 thus , equation becomes @xmath36 assuming that the joint probability @xmath37 exist we can write the average in the above equation as @xmath38 if the inter - pulse durations follow the markov process then the conditional probabilities depend only on the previous value of the inter - pulse duration , @xmath39 . in this case",
    "@xmath40    let us consider a situation when the probability density function ( pdf ) of inter - pulse durations @xmath41 is significant only for @xmath42 in some range @xmath43 and is very small for @xmath42 outside this range .",
    "in addition , we will assume that the conditional probability @xmath44 has the following properties : the average equal to the previous value of inter - pulse duration @xmath45 and the dispersion @xmath46 is much smaller than the dispersion of inter - pulse durations @xmath47 these assumptions denote that the average difference between the neighboring inter - pulse durations is small , i.e. , the increments and decrements of the inter - event duration are small in comparison to the inter - event time it self .    when @xmath48 then the dispersion of inter - pulse durations is @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath50 . when the assumptions and @xmath51 hold , we can approximate the conditional probability @xmath44 by a @xmath27-function : @xmath52 .",
    "the approximation in equation is valid only for sufficient small @xmath53 , smaller than some maximum value @xmath54 , because the error grows with the number of terms . using in equation the approximation of the conditional probability by @xmath27-function",
    "we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the characteristic function of inter - pulse durations .",
    "we can estimate the value of @xmath54 as follows : the approximation of the conditional probability @xmath44 by @xmath27-function is not applicable when the dispersion of @xmath57 for a given @xmath58 becomes comparable with the dispersion @xmath59 .",
    "assuming that the dispersion of @xmath60 , for a given @xmath58 , grows linearly with @xmath61 ( as would be the case for a random walk ) we require that @xmath62 and , therefore , @xmath63 for high enough frequency , when @xmath64 the characteristic functions @xmath65 corresponding to large @xmath66 are small and we can neglect in equation the terms with @xmath67 . including only the terms with @xmath68 we get the expression for the psd @xmath69 after the summation in equation we obtain @xmath70 we have dropped @xmath71 in @xmath72 because @xmath54 is large , @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , for small frequencies @xmath74 we approximated @xmath75 in the denominator as @xmath76 .",
    "the function @xmath77 has a sharp peak of the width @xmath78 at @xmath79 and decreases at larger @xmath80 . if @xmath81 then this peak is much narrower that the width of the pdf @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , the peak of the function @xmath77 has a significant overlap with @xmath82 when @xmath83 . in this case",
    "we obtain the following approximate expression for the psd : @xmath84 this equation shows that we get @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "summing up the assumptions made above , the range of the frequencies where this expression for psd holds is @xmath85 when @xmath86 the upper limit of the frequency range is determined by @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the ratio of upper and lower limiting frequencies is @xmath88 . for larger @xmath89",
    "the ratio of upper and lower limiting frequencies is @xmath90 .",

    "in addition , we have reflections from the minimum inter - pulse duration @xmath91 and from the maximum inter - pulse duration @xmath87 .",
    "numerically obtained psd of such a signal is shown in .",
    "we see a power - law part in the psd with the slope @xmath95 in a broad range of frequencies from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "this range of frequencies agrees with the estimation .",
    "psd of the power - law form with the exponents different from @xmath95 can be obtained by including in equation an additional drift term . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the drift term of the power - law form @xmath98 and power - law pdf of the inter - pulse duration @xmath99 lead to the power - law psd @xmath100 with @xmath101 . as a process generating the power - law probability distribution function for @xmath60 a multiplicative stochastic process @xmath102 has been suggested . here",
    "@xmath103 are normally distributed uncorrelated random variables with a zero expectation and unit variance . for this process @xmath104 and @xmath105 . has been used for modeling of the internote interval sequences of the musical rhythms @xcite .",
    "in this section we generalize the model presented in the previous section .",
    "we do this by noticing that in the pulse sequence there are two strictly increasing sequences of numbers : the physical time @xmath106 and the pulse number @xmath31 .",
    "the pulse number can be interpreted as an internal time of the pulse sequence .",
    "the relation between the physical time and the internal time is not deterministic because the inter - pulse durations are random .",
    "thus we propose the introduction of the difference between the physical and the internal , operational , time as a way to obtain @xmath0 noise also for other stochastic processes . to do this we start with a stochastic process and interpret the time as an internal parameter .",
    "in addition to this stochastic process we need to include an additional relation between the physical time and the internal time . in order to maintain a similarity to the point process described in the previous section , the increments of the physical time",
    "should be a power - law function of the magnitude of the signal . in this section as an initial stochastic process we take a process described by a stochastic differential equation .",
    "langevin equation coupled to an additional equation for the physical time have been introduced to describe anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "in particular , position - dependent time subordinator has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the langevin equation describing the diffusion of the particle subjected to an external force @xmath107 here @xmath108 and @xmath109 are drift and diffusion coefficients and @xmath110 is a standard wiener process .",
    "for generality we assume that both coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath112 can depend on the stochastic variable @xmath15 . in case when the diffusion coefficient @xmath112 in equation depends on @xmath15 we assume it interpretation . in equation we replace the physical time @xmath106 by the operational time @xmath113 , @xmath114 the pdf @xmath115 of the stochastic variable @xmath15 as a function of the operational time @xmath113 obeys the fokker - planck equation corresponding to it sde   @xcite @xmath116    primarily we consider the situation when the small increments of the physical time are deterministic and are proportional to the increments of the operational time .",
    "thus , the physical time @xmath106 is related to the operational time @xmath113 via the equation @xmath117 here the positive function @xmath118 is the intensity of random time that depends on the intensity of the signal @xmath15 . if we interpret equation as describing the diffusion of a particle in non - homogeneous medium , the function @xmath118 models the position of structures responsible for either trapping or accelerating the particle @xcite .",
    "large values of @xmath118 corresponds to trapping of the particle , whereas small @xmath118 leads to the acceleration of diffusion . for fixed particle position @xmath15",
    "the coefficient @xmath118 in equation is constant and from equation follows the relationship @xmath119 for the pdf @xmath120 of the physical time @xmath106 as a function of the operational time @xmath113 .",
    "equations and together define the subordinated process . however , now the processes @xmath121 and @xmath122 are not independent .",
    "let us derive the langevin equation for the stochastic variable @xmath15 in the physical time @xmath106 . to do this",
    ", we consider the joint pdf @xmath123 of the stochastic variables @xmath15 and @xmath106 . equations and yield the two - dimensional fokker - planck equation",
    "@xmath124 this equation is a combination of equations and .",
    "the zero of the physical time @xmath106 coincides with the zero of the operational time @xmath113 , therefore , the initial condition for equation is @xmath125 . coinciding zeros of @xmath106 and @xmath113 lead also to the boundary condition @xmath126 for @xmath127 , because @xmath106 and @xmath113 are strictly increasing .    instead of @xmath15 and @xmath106",
    "we can consider @xmath15 and @xmath113 as stochastic variables .",

    "the pdf of the subordinated random process @xmath137 is @xmath138 . integrating both sides of equation we obtain @xmath139 thus , position - dependent trapping leads to the position - dependent coefficients in the fokker - planck equation , even if the initial sde   has constant coefficients .",
    "corresponds to the single equation in the physical time with the multiplicative noise , @xmath140 in fact , the fokker - planck equation can be obtained from the coupled equations and @xmath141    the relationship between the physical time @xmath106 and the operational time @xmath113 can be not necessarily deterministic , equation can have a stochastic term . if the fluctuations of this stochastic term are much faster than the fluctuations of the stochastic variable @xmath15 , we can approximate them by the average value . in this case @xmath118",
    "describes the average increment of the physical time .",

    "in this section we consider several stochastic processes and , introducing the internal and external times , we check whether @xmath0 noise can be obtained . in a signal consisting of pulses",
    "the internal time is just the pulse number and the increment of the physical time is equal to the inter - pulse duration .",
    "the intensity of such a signal is inversely proportional to the inter - pulse duration . in order to obtain @xmath0 noise similarly as for the signal consisting of pulses we choose the function @xmath118 in equation as a power - law function of @xmath15 , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the power - law exponent .",

    "the reason for the appearance of @xmath0 spectrum is the scaling properties of the signal : the change of the magnitude of the variable @xmath153 is equivalent to the change of the time scale @xmath154 .",

    "more complex situation is the diffusion in nonhomogeneous media , for example , diffusion on fractals and multifractals @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous medium with steep gradients of the diffusivity can be created via a local variation of the temperature in thermophoresis experiments @xcite .",
    "spatial heterogeneities are also present in the case of anomalous diffusion in subsurface hydrology @xcite . in the random walk description",
    "spatially varying diffusivity can be translated into a local dependence of the waiting time for a jump event . in the heterogeneous medium",
    "the properties of a trap can reflect the medium structure , thus in the description of transport the waiting time should explicitly depend on the position of the particle @xcite .",
    "a method to include position dependent waiting time is a consideration of the position - dependent time subordinator @xcite .    in general , the trapping time can depend not on the position of the particle but on some other quantity .",
    "then in the dynamics of this quantity the difference between the physical and operational time also arises , with the relationship between the times dependent on the intensity of the signal .    in socio - economical systems the internal time can reflect fluctuating human activity @xcite .",
    "for example , in finance the long - range correlations in volatility arise due to fluctuations of the trading activity @xcite .",
    "we have shown that @xmath0 noise occurs when the internal time and the physical time are related via the power - law function of the signal intensity , for example , via equation or .",
    "although we have considered only random processes described by a sde , we expect that the mechanism of the appearance of @xmath0 noise presented here is quite general and should work also for other random processes .",
    "we anticipate that the present model can be useful for explaining @xmath0 noise in different complex systems .",
    "in addition , we suggested a way of solving highly non - linear sdes by introducing suitably chosen internal time and variable step of integration .",
