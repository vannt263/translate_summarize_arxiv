    "a non - holonomic system ( with linear constraints ) consists of a configuration manifold @xmath6 , a lagrangian @xmath7 , and a non - integrable smooth distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the equations of motion for a curve @xmath9 in @xmath6 are determined by the lagrange - dalembert principle ( constraining force does not exert work ) supplemented by the condition that @xmath10 . we shall only deal with constraint distributions @xmath11 that are of constant rank .",
    "further , @xmath12 will be of the form ` kinetic energy minus potential ' where the kinetic energy defines a riemannian metric @xmath13 on the configuration manifold .",
    "a @xmath14-chaplygin system is a non - holonomic system @xmath15 which is invariant under a free and proper action by a lie group @xmath14 on @xmath6 such that @xmath11 defines a connection on the principal bundle @xmath16 .",
    "it is not required that @xmath11 is the mechanical connection associated to @xmath13 . under these assumptions",
    "the equations of motion can be written in a particularly nice format .",
    "let @xmath17 be the reduced configuration space , @xmath18 the canonical symplectic form on @xmath19 , @xmath20 the standard momentum mapof the lifted @xmath14-action on @xmath21 , and @xmath22 be the curvature form associated to @xmath11 .",
    "then the non - holonomic system can be reduced , or _ compressed _ , to a dynamical system on @xmath19 with dynamics given by the vector field",
    "@xmath23 which is defined by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the _ compressed hamiltonian _ ; it is the function induced from the legendre transform of @xmath12 .",
    "the term @xmath26 does make sense as a semi - basic two - form on @xmath19 since ambiguities cancel out .",
    "the form @xmath27 is , in general , an almost symplectic form , that is , it is non - degenerate and non - closed .",
    "we will thus view the compressed system @xmath28 as an _ almost hamiltonian _ system .",
    "see @xcite and section  [ s : ham - setting ] .",
    "( our sign in is different from that in @xcite because of our choice of sign in @xmath29 : @xcite choose @xmath30 whence for them @xmath31 . )",
    "the present paper is only concerned with non - holonomic systems that arise as @xmath14-chaplygin systems , and the description of the dynamics in terms of the above mentioned compression process will be our starting point .",
    "the question arises whether the compressed system @xmath28 is hamiltonizable : is there a positive function @xmath32 such that @xmath33 is closed",
    "? if this is the case one says that @xmath27 is conformally symplectic .",
    "the interpretation is that one is looking for an @xmath34 dependent time reparametrization @xmath35 so that the system becomes hamiltonian in the new time .",
    "that is , the dynamics described by the vector field @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , are hamiltonian in the usual sense with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , it follows that the volume form @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is preserved by the flow of @xmath23 .",
    "conversely , when a preserved volume form @xmath40 exists then @xmath41 is a candidate for a conformal factor .",
    "see the discussion in ehlers , koiller , montgomery and rios  @xcite .",
    "the classical chaplygin sphere problem ( @xcite ) is that of a dynamically balanced @xmath4-dimensional ball that rolls on a horizontal table without slipping .",
    "dynamically balanced means that the geometric center coincides with the center of mass .",
    "however , we do not suppose that the mass distribution is homogeneous .",
    "the inertia matrix can be any symmetric positive definite three by three matrix .",
    "the no slip condition is a non - holonomic constraint on the velocities .",
    "the ball is allowed to rotate about its vertical axis .",
    "the reduced equations were first found and integrated by chaplygin  @xcite in terms of hyper - elliptic functions . a thorough study of the algebraic integrability is given in duistermaat  @xcite where it is explicitly stated that the system is not hamiltonian .",
    "chaplygin s rolling ball is a @xmath14-chaplygin system with configuration space @xmath42 , constraint distribution @xmath11 , kinetic energy lagrangian , and symmetry group @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath11 defines a horizontal connection on @xmath44 .",
    "see section  [ s : chaplygin ] for details .",
    "in @xcite the compression of this system to an almost hamiltonian system @xmath28 is carried out .",
    "further , @xcite prove that this compressed system is not hamiltonizable ( at the @xmath45-level ) , not even in the homogeneous case . on the other hand , borisov and mamaev  @xcite",
    "give explicit formulas for a poisson bracket which allow to write the ( reduced ) equations of motion for chaplygin s ball as a true hamiltonian system .",
    "( their bracket is explained in geometric terms involving _ affine almost poisson structures _ in @xcite . )",
    "their result is all the more remarkable as it is in apparent contradiction to the assertions of @xcite .",
    "it actually seems to be a general phenomenon that integrable non - holonomic systems are related to integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "this observation provides an important motivation for a systematic study of hamiltonization of integrable non - holonomic systems .",
    "chaplygin s rolling ball is the topic of section  [ s : chaplygin ] .",
    "we describe its compression @xmath28 in detail , write the system in the form ( [ e : comp - syst ] ) , and pay particular attention to the fact that there remains a further symmetry group even after compression .",
    "indeed , rotation of the ball about its vertical axis induces an @xmath46-action on the compressed phase space @xmath19 that preserves @xmath47 and @xmath27 . in emphasizing the role of the @xmath26-term and the almost hamiltonian point of view",
    "we follow very closely the exposition of @xcite .",
    "the main theme of the present paper is to establish a synthesis between the papers of @xcite and @xcite . the crucial idea",
    "( actually due to @xcite ) which is used in this note is that the compressed system should be further reduced with respect to the induced @xmath46-action , and hamiltonization should be attempted afterwards on the ultimate reduced space @xmath48 .",
    "( this is in agreement with @xcite since the symplectic leaves of their poisson bracket can be realized as magnetic cotangent bundles over @xmath49 . )",
    "the @xmath46-symmetries are generally referred to as internal symmetries of the system .",
    "describing the corresponding reduction procedure is non - trivial and is the main result of the paper .",
    "( see theorems  [ thm : trunc ] and [ prop : trunc ] . )",
    "this problem can be stated also for higher dimensional chaplygin balls .",
    "let @xmath50 be the shape space of the @xmath0-dimensional chaplygin ball rolling on an @xmath51-dimensional horizontal plane with internal symmetry group @xmath52 .",
    "internal symmetries are very well behaved in that they give rise to conserved quantities : the standard momentum map@xmath53 with respect to the canonical form @xmath18 is constant along flow lines of @xmath23 .",
    "however , @xmath54 is _ not _ the momentum mapwith respect to @xmath27 .",
    "that is , for @xmath55 , the restriction of @xmath27 to @xmath56 does not define a basic two form on the bundle @xmath57 whence the system does not descend to the ` would be ' ultimate reduced space .",
    "this is true already for @xmath58 .",
    "now the point of theorem  [ prop : trunc ] is that @xmath27 can be _ truncated _ in a way that does not affect the equations of motion but does provide the correct momentum map .",
    "effectively we replace @xmath27 by a new two form @xmath59 that is non - degenerate , @xmath60-invariant , and satisfies @xmath61 for all @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the infinitesimal generator associated to @xmath64 .",
    "why the name truncation ? to construct @xmath59 we use an @xmath60-connection on the principal bundle @xmath65 such that @xmath23 is horizontal .",
    "we employ this connection to truncate the @xmath26-term in such a way that it becomes horizontal with respect to the @xmath60-action and we retain only the necessary information about the dynamics .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ prop : trunc ] gives an explicit formula @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the curvature form associated to the hopf connection on @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a certain mapping ( related to angular velocity in the space frame ) that coincides with @xmath54 if and only if the ball is homogeneous .",
    "notice also that @xmath59 is of the same format ` canonical form minus semi - basic ' as @xmath27 .",
    "now , one can carry out almost hamiltonian reduction ( @xcite ) of @xmath70 with respect to the @xmath60-action .",
    "it follows immediately , for any dimension @xmath0 , that the ultimate reduced system on @xmath3 ( or rather on a fiber bundle @xmath71  see corollary  [ cor:4.2 ] ) is hamiltonian when the ball is homogeneous .",
    "for the non - homogeneous case , thanks to the formula for @xmath59 we can reprove the result of @xcite on hamiltonization of the @xmath4-dimensional ball in relatively simple geometric terms .",
    "see proposition  [ prop : ham ] .",
    "hamiltonization of chaplygin s ball for higher dimensions is still an open problem .",
    "it is , however , hoped that theorem  [ prop : trunc ] can be of some help in this direction .",
    "( after this paper was finished , important progress was made by @xcite . )",
    "the proof of hamiltonization of the 3-dimensional ball given in @xcite relies on chaplygin s reducing multiplier theorem .",
    "this theorem applies only to a certain kind of almost hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , and states that existence of a preserved measure is equivalent to existence of a conformal factor .",
    "an alternative method that has been used to prove hamiltonization of higher dimensional non - holonomic systems is to explicitly establish an isomorphism with a classical hamiltonian system @xcite .",
    "our approach is valuable in that it is purely geometric , it does not have an a - priori dimension restriction , and it ties together the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in section  [ s : internalsym ] we study general @xmath14-chaplygin systems with internal symmetries . in this context",
    "we describe a reduction procedure that is similar to reduction in stages in symplectic geometry .",
    "section  [ s : chaplygin ] is used as a motivation for doing so but can be read independently since all the results are proved directly .",
    "the set - up in this context is a generalization of the chaplygin ball described above .",
    "thus @xmath72 is a @xmath14-principal fiber bundle with connection one - form @xmath73 and @xmath13 is an invariant metric .",
    "the internal symmetries are modeled by _ two _ additional free and proper actions , called @xmath74 and @xmath75 , of the _ same _ lie group @xmath60 on @xmath6 satisfying appropriate compatibility conditions with regard to the connection @xmath76 and the metric @xmath13 and the projection @xmath77 .",
    "the compression of the data @xmath78 and the induced @xmath60-action on @xmath19 are described . from the non - holonomic noether theorem",
    "it is concluded that the standard momentum map@xmath79 with respect to the canonical symplectic form on @xmath19 is constant along flow lines of @xmath23 .",
    "but @xmath54 need not be the momentum mapassociated to @xmath27 .",
    "however , we can replace @xmath27 with a non - degenerate and @xmath60-invariant two form @xmath59 which not only gives the correct dynamics , @xmath80 , but also the desired momentum map@xmath54 , @xmath81 for all @xmath62 .",
    "this is accomplished via truncation with respect to a choice of an auxiliary connection @xmath82 on the principal bundle @xmath65 .",
    "again @xmath83 is subject to the condition that @xmath23 be horizontal .",
    "such a @xmath83 is shown to always exist over an open sub - manifold of @xmath19 which is invariant under the @xmath60-action and the dynamics of @xmath23 .",
    "this process of compression being followed by reduction of internal symmetries has very much the flavor of reduction in stages . indeed , when @xmath76 is the mechanical connection associated to @xmath13 one can replace compression followed by reduction by usual reduction in stages .",
    "a non - holonomic system is a triple @xmath15 where @xmath6 is a configuration manifold , @xmath7 is a lagrangian , and @xmath8 is a smooth non - integrable distribution which is supposed to be of constant rank .",
    "the equations of motion for a curve @xmath9 which should satisfy @xmath10 are then stated in terms of the lagrange dalembert principle .",
    "we shall only be concerned with lagrangians of the form @xmath84 where @xmath13 is a riemannian metric on @xmath6 and @xmath85 is a potential . in this case",
    "there is also an ( almost ) hamiltonian version ( see @xcite , e.g. ) : continue to use the symbol @xmath13 to denote the co - metric and consider the hamiltonian @xmath86 . since @xmath11 is of constant rank",
    "there is a family of independent one - forms @xmath87 such that @xmath11 is the joint kernel of these . in terms of coordinates",
    "@xmath88 the equations of motion are @xmath89 where the @xmath90 are the lagrange multipliers to be determined from the supplementary condition that @xmath91 . with @xmath92",
    "we may thus rephrase the equations as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the canonical symplectic form on @xmath21 and @xmath95 is the footpoint projection .",
    "( the space @xmath96 which is a pseudonym for the distribution @xmath11 will be defined below . )    roughly speaking , the process of writing the equations of motion for a non - holonomic system in an almost hamiltonian way amounts to eliminating the lagrange multipliers from the equations of motion , and encoding the forces of constraint in a bracket of functions ( which fails the jacobi identity ) or a ( non - closed ) two - form .",
    "once this is accomplished the constraints are satisfied automatically .",
    "this process is developed below in terms of a two - form .",
    "let @xmath14 be a lie group that acts freely , properly and by isometries on the riemannian manifold @xmath97 .",
    "a @xmath14- is a non - holonomic system @xmath98 that has the property that @xmath11 is a principal connection on the principal bundle @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath11 is the kernel of a connection form @xmath99 .",
    "notice that we do not require @xmath76 to be the mechanical connection associated to @xmath13 .",
    "( in principle one could also include a @xmath14-invariant function @xmath85 but we will not have use for this . )    we will now assume that @xmath100 is a @xmath14-chaplygin system and repeat some of the constructions that are done in @xcite .",
    "in fact @xcite proceed in greater generality .",
    "however , in the sequel we will only be interested in chaplygin systems whence the infinitesimal group orbit directions form an exact complement to the distribution @xmath11 , and this facilitates the development .",
    "there is a sub - manifold @xmath101 that corresponds to the constraint distribution , and the inclusion will be denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , @xmath103 is invariant under the cotangent lifted action by @xmath14 , and there is an induced connection @xmath104 on the principal bundle @xmath105 .",
    "its horizontal space will be called @xmath106 ( this corresponds to the space @xmath60 in @xcite . )    the fiber - wise restriction of @xmath107 to @xmath108 is non - degenerate .",
    "let us denote this restriction by @xmath109 .",
    "for the simple reason that @xmath108 is not the tangent space of any manifold one can not say that @xmath109 is a two - form . nevertheless , morally it is this restriction process that destroys the closedness property of @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath110 is tangent to @xmath103 and takes values in @xmath108 one may thus rewrite the equations of motion in the appealing format @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the restriction of @xmath113 to @xmath108 .      in this section",
    "we review the compression of @xmath14-chaplygin systems from the hamiltonian perspective .",
    "this will also allow us to introduce some additional notation .",
    "the original references are @xcite .",
    "we shall follow @xcite and use the word compression instead of non - holonomic reduction .",
    "consider a @xmath14-chaplygin system on a configuration manifold @xmath6 with constraint distribution @xmath114 as defined above .",
    "recall that @xmath6 is endowed with the kinetic energy metric @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the induced metric on @xmath116 that makes @xmath117 a riemannian submersion .",
    "( to facilitate the notation , we will sometimes tacitly identify tangent and cotangent space of @xmath6 and @xmath116 via their respective metrics . )",
    "consider the orbit projection map @xmath118 using the respective metrics we can write @xmath119 as the composition @xmath120 we may also associate a fiber - wise inverse to this mapping which is given by the horizontal lift mapping @xmath121 associated to @xmath76 .",
    "( this inverse was called the clock - wise diagram in ( * ? ? ?",

    "this result is well - known .",
    "it is contained in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we include the following proof of the ` @xmath26-formula ' because it is slightly different in its flavor from those that can be found in the literature .",
    "note that our sign in the @xmath26-formula differs from that in @xcite since we are using a different convention for the canonical exact symplectic form .",
    "( for sake of brevity we will sometimes write @xmath133 instead of @xmath134 . )",
    "we need to show that @xmath135 on @xmath136 .",
    "work locally , i.e. , assume that @xmath137 is a direct product and that @xmath138 is trivializable . via right trivialization",
    "we shall also identify @xmath139 .",
    "thus the connection is given by @xmath140 the horizontal space is @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath142 be vector - fields on @xmath103 with values in @xmath143 that project to vector - fields @xmath144 .",

    "<S> this approach yields an explicit description of the reduced system in terms of the geometric data involved . due to this description </S>",
    "<S> we can study hamiltonizability of the system . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the @xmath4-dimensional ball becomes hamiltonian at the @xmath5-level after time reparametrization , whereby we re - prove a result of @xcite in symplecto - geometric terms . </S>",
