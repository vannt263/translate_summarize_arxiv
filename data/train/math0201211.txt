    "a basic combinatorial problem associated to a quadriculated surface is the counting of its tilings by dominos .",
    "tilings of rectangles of integral sides , for example , were counted by kasteleyn @xcite in his solution of the ising model . more generally , kasteleyn showed how to slightly alter the adjacency matrix of a quadriculated disk so that the determinant of the resulting _ kasteleyn matrix _ equals the desired count . here ,",
    "the adjacency matrix specifies which squares of the quadriculated surface share an edge .",
    "tilings of other surfaces have been counted : the _ aztec diamond _ is another example , presented in @xcite .",
    "moreover , tilings have been _ q - counted _ , according to a height variable @xmath9 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved , in a different language , that the ( @xmath7)-counting of tilings of a quadriculated disk is always equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath7 .",
    "their interest in the issue stemmed from the fact that the adjacency matrix @xmath1 of a quadriculated surface is closely related to a standard discretization of the laplacian with dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the result indicates a _ spectral rigidity _ for the discrete laplacian , which so far has no interpretation in the continuous case .",
    "further study of this rigidity led to consider additional properties of ( @xmath7)-counting , both on disks @xcite and on annuli @xcite .",
    "since the adjacency matrix @xmath1 has only integer entries , it may be interpreted as a linear transformation @xmath12 between vector spaces over an arbitrary field @xmath2 . by coloring squares of the quadriculated disk black and white in a chessboard fashion ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath12 takes vectors supported on the set of black squares ( forming a subspace @xmath13 ) to vectors supported on white squares ( in @xmath14 ) , and vice - versa .",
    "thus , @xmath12 splits naturally into two linear maps , and and the kernel of @xmath12 is the direct sum of the kernels of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in this paper , we describe the kernel of @xmath12 in the special case of an @xmath0 rectangle quadriculated by ( @xmath17 ) squares of side of length @xmath11 .",

    "there is a basis to each kernel for which all vector coordinates are equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath7 .",
    "more recently @xcite , it was shown that , for an arbitrary quadriculated disk , both matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 admit @xmath23-type decompositions , where the matrices @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 have all entries equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath7 . from this result , the fact that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent of @xmath2 and the existence of bases for the kernels with entries equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 follows .",
    "the decomposition also implies the rigidity result in @xcite .    when @xmath8 , the discretization of the laplacian essentially coincides with the adjacency matrix @xmath29 and we call the elements on @xmath30 and @xmath31 the _ polarized _",

    "the upshot of the classification is the following  _ the possible chunks in a splitting @xmath160 are the tiles in figure [ pecas ] : @xmath160 is a tiling_. thus , the function @xmath151 indeed takes nonzero vectors in the kernel of @xmath62 to the subset @xmath43 of tilings .",
    "there is an analogous function @xmath152 from @xmath188 to @xmath189",
    "we start showing that @xmath190 is injective .",
    "take @xmath191 , inducing tilings @xmath160 and @xmath192 .",
    "we have to show that if @xmath193 , then @xmath194 ( and then , trivially , @xmath195 ) .",
    "if @xmath196 , then @xmath157 and @xmath197 may only differ on @xmath36 , since the only sides which may be active or not lie there .",
    "it is the shape of the tile which determines which side is active or not : inactive sides are the large basis of trapezoidal tiles and short sides of right triangles .",
    "thus , sides of a tile in @xmath193 belonging to @xmath36 must be simultaneously active or not in both @xmath155 and @xmath47 , and the proof of injectivity is complete .",
    "we now consider the surjectivity of @xmath151 . given a tiling @xmath198 ( and in particular , the description of type of activity for each side )",
    ", we have to find a nonzero vector @xmath199 for which @xmath200 .",
    "the sequence of steps below is natural .",
    "we must show that , for each white point @xmath65 , the sum of the values @xmath203 for its neighbors @xmath154 is even . by checking for each kind of tile ,",
    "it is clear that the sum of @xmath203 for neighbors @xmath40 of @xmath65 in a single tile is even .",
    "thus , if @xmath65 lies in the interior of a tile , we are done .",
    "suppose now that @xmath65 lies in a side of a tile of @xmath145 .",
    "first , notice that vertices of tiles belonging to active sides are black .",
    "hence , if @xmath65 is such a vertex , it must belong to inactive sides , and thus , both sides containing @xmath65 lie in @xmath36  @xmath65 must be a corner of @xmath34 , belonging to a right triangle . in this case , the black neighbors of @xmath65 are active , if the short sides of the triangle are of length 1 , or inactive , for longer lengths . in both cases , the total sum of @xmath203 over black neighbors",
    "@xmath40 of @xmath65 is even .",
    "finally , if @xmath65 belongs to a side of a tile without being a vertex , this side must be either horizontal or vertical , since diagonal sides only cross black points .",
    "if this side lies in @xmath36 , all the black neighbors of @xmath65 belong to the same tile , and we are done . if , instead , this side is in the interior of @xmath34 , we may take it to be horizontal and it must be an active side .",
    "thus , @xmath204 , where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the side neighbors of @xmath65 . besides , the black neighbors of @xmath65 belong to two tiles , since @xmath65 is not a vertex .",
    "suppose @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath205 in one tile and @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath206 in another .",
    "then @xmath207 and @xmath208 are even .",
    "since @xmath204 , we must have .",
    "hence , @xmath209      the black points by which non - dashed sides of @xmath145 and @xmath160 passes are the same . indeed , these are the active points of @xmath155 .",
    "we are left with checking that the segments between these points are the same in @xmath145 and @xmath160 .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 consists of segments common to both tilings .",
    "therefore dashed sides are irrelevant : we only need to prove that @xmath145 and @xmath160 have the same active segments .",
    "the _ active neighborhood _ of a point @xmath173 under @xmath199 is the set of its active black neighbors in @xmath57 .",
    "an active neighborhood is _ trivial _ if there are no active points .",
    "a simple check obtains all nontrivial active neighborhoods : they are listed in figure [ vizinhancas ] , up to rotations . in cases ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath65 is an interior point ; in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , @xmath65 belongs to a side of @xmath36 , and in ( 6 ) , @xmath65 is a corner of @xmath34 .",
    "trivial active neighborhoods are not relevant in the forthcoming argument . in order to show that @xmath145 and @xmath210 have the same active segments , all we have to do is to show this fact for each active neighborhood .",

    "suppose that this segment does not belong to @xmath145 : @xmath65 then is in the interior of a tile @xmath212 of @xmath145 .",
    "the two active neighbors of @xmath65 belong to the boundary of @xmath212 , by the construction of @xmath155 from @xmath145 . since tiles are convex , the segments of @xmath145 form angles which are less than or equal to @xmath213 .",
    "also , sides of tiles in @xmath145 do not pass by points at which @xmath155 is zero ( we do not have to take into account boundary points ) .",
    "thus , the sides of @xmath212 passing by the active points of the neighborhood of @xmath65 must be horizontal , as shown in figure [ situacao1 ] ; these sides extend to active neighbors at distance 2 .",
    "but , by figure [ pecas ] horizontal sides have length at most 2  contradiction",
    ". thus @xmath145 equals @xmath160 , when restricted to an active neighborhood of type ( 1 ) .      for a neighborhood of type ( 2 )",
    ", @xmath145 contains active segments joining each neighbor of @xmath65 to some other neighbor .",
    "consider the possibility of one of this segments being horizontal , as @xmath214 in figure [ situacoes3].1 .",
    "neighbor @xmath168 is either joined to @xmath205 or to @xmath206 , up to trivial symmetries , as in figure [ situacoes3 ] .",
    "tiling @xmath145 can not contain ( 1 ) , since the @xmath174 angle may only appear at @xmath36 ( again , check the shape of tiles in figure [ pecas ] ) .",
    "possibility ( 2 ) may not happen either , since it implies a white vertex of a tile which is not a corner of @xmath34 .",
    "thus segment @xmath214 is not in @xmath145 .",
    "vertical segments are equally excluded .",
    "suppose now that there are only diagonal active segments .",
    "the only tile with parallel diagonal sides @xmath215 apart is the tilted square .",
    "thus , the four diagonal segments must appear in both @xmath145 and @xmath160 .",
    "a consequence of the theorem is the fact that tilings of the same color can be added , since they correspond to kernel elements of the same matrix .",
    "figure [ metodo ] shows all tilings of the @xmath216 rectangle : the nonzero elements in the kernel of @xmath67 give rise to the first three , @xmath1 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the remaining ones correspond to nonzero elements in the kernel of @xmath62 .",
    "we now consider the lifting of polarized @xmath32-harmonic functions .",
    "again , a tiling @xmath145 corresponds to a vector @xmath219 .",
    "consider its graph @xmath157 of active points : from the shape of the tiles , each loop in the graph has even length .",
    "in particular , active points may be labeled @xmath11 and @xmath7 alternatively : this defines the _ lifting _ of @xmath155 to a vector with coordinates equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 which may be interpreted as lying in @xmath46 .",
