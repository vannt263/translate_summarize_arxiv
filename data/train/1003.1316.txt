    "the matrix element method is unique among the analysis methods used in experimental particle physics because of the direct link it establishes between theory and event reconstruction .",
    "originally developed to minimize the statistical uncertainty in measurements of @xmath1events at the tevatron experiments d0and cdf  @xcite , it has since been applied with great success to measurements of the top quark mass @xmath2  @xcite and also in the discovery of electroweak production of single top quarks  @xcite .",
    "the method can in principle be used for any measurement , with the largest gain compared to cut - based analysis techniques expected for processes involving intermediate resonances and leading to many - particle final states . in general , the matrix element method can be used to determine several unknown parameters ( theoretical parameters describing the physics processes measured as well as experimental parameters describing the detector response ) at the same time in one measurement , thus also allowing for a reduction of systematic uncertainties .",
    "this paper presents the analysis method in general and also gives an example of how the determination of such additional parameters can be implemented .",
    "recent measurements in @xmath1events containing one leptonic and one hadronic @xmath3decay ( `` lepton+jetsevents '' ) already exploit the known @xmath3mass to constrain the energy scale for light - quark jets and significantly reduce the main systematic uncertainty of early measurements of the top quark mass . among the largest remaining systematic uncertainties",
    "is the uncertainty on potential differences between the energy scales @xmath4and @xmath5for @xmath0- and light - quark jetsand @xmath5denote scale factors relative to the nominal detector calibration . in the definition of these factors",
    ", it is assumed that all experimental corrections to measured jet energies have been applied to the events that enter the analysis , such that @xmath4and @xmath5do not depend on quantities like the jet direction or energy .",
    "uncertainties on such dependencies give rise to additional systematic uncertainties of the measurement e.  g.  of the top quark mass . ] . without further improvements",
    ", it will soon become a limiting uncertainty for those measurements that dominate the world - average value  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how together with the top quark mass , a simultaneous additional measurement of the @xmath0-quark jet energy scale , which was first proposed in  @xcite for the lepton+jetschannel , can be incorporated naturally in the matrix element technique  not only for measurements in the lepton+jetschannel , but also in @xmath1events with two leptonic @xmath3decays ( `` dilepton events '' ) where the quantities to be measured can not be reconstructed based on the kinematical information of a single event alone .",
    "this study considers the case of the tevatron ( proton - antiproton collisions at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 ) as a concrete example but is applicable to the two lhc experiments atlas and cms as well .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ method.sec ] , an overview of the matrix element method is given .",
    "section  [ samples.sec ] discusses the generation and selection of @xmath1events used for the studies described in the further sections .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the implementation of the likelihood calculation for signal and background processes for @xmath1measurements in the lepton+jetsand dilepton channels in section  [ application.sec ] .",
    "we then describe studies of the performance of the new measurement technique , separately for lepton+jets(section  [ enstestljets.sec ] ) and dilepton ( section  [ enstestdilepton.sec ] ) @xmath1events . in section  [ systuncs.sec ] , systematic uncertainties on @xmath2are addressed , with an emphasis on the effect of events with significant initial- and final - state radiation .",
    "section  [ conclusions.sec ] summarizes the findings and gives an outlook .",
    "the matrix element method is based on the likelihood @xmath7to observe a sample of selected events in the detector .",
    "the likelihood is obtained directly from the theory prediction for the differential cross - sections of the relevant processes and the detector resolution and is calculated as a function of the assumed values for each of the parameters to be measured .",
    "the minimization of @xmath8 yields the measurement of the parameters , where the likelihood @xmath7for the entire event sample is computed as the product of likelihoods to observe each individual event .",
    "this is in contrast to most analysis methods used in experimental particle physics , where distributions from observed events in the detector are compared with corresponding distributions obtained from simulated events that have been generated according to theory and then passed through a detector simulation and the same event reconstruction software .",
    "this paper concentrates on the case of the measurement of the top quark mass in lepton+jetsand dilepton events at a hadron collider , where the parameters to be measured are the top quark mass @xmath2 , factors @xmath4and @xmath5describing the energy scales for @xmath0- and light - quark jets relative to the default energy scaleevents , only @xmath0-quark jets occur and thus only @xmath4is determined .",

    "] , and the fraction @xmath9of signal events in the channel under consideration .",
    "a comparison of the matrix element method with other methods to measure the top quark mass can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the sample likelihood @xmath7for @xmath10 measured events to have measured properties @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 where the symbol @xmath13 denotes assumed values of the physics parameters to be measured , @xmath14 stands for parameters describing the detector response that are to be determined , and @xmath15 is defined below .",
    "the likelihood @xmath16 to observe event @xmath17 under the assumption of parameter values @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is given as the linear combination @xmath18 where the sum is over all individual processes @xmath19 that could have led to the observed event @xmath17 , @xmath20 is the likelihood to observe this event under the assumption that it was produced via process @xmath19 , and @xmath21 denotes the fraction of events from process @xmath19 in the entire event sample , with @xmath22 . in total , the physics parameters @xmath13 , the detector response described by @xmath14 , and the event fractions @xmath15 are to be determined simultaneously from the minimization of @xmath8 .",
    "the likelihood @xmath23 in turn is given by the theoretical description of the process and the resolution of the concrete experiment , and is computed as the convolution of the differential partonic cross section with the parton distribution functions of the colliding hadrons and with the detector response . to make the likelihood calculation manageable , simplifying assumptions",
    "are introduced .",
    "this concerns the description of both the detector response and the physics processes @xmath19 , where only the dominant ones are considered explicitly , and where the effects of parton shower and hadronization are accounted for with a simple parametrization . because of these simplifications , the technique has to be calibrated using fully simulated events before applying it in an actual measurement on data . in this paper ,",
    "a conceptual study is presented .",
    "we show how the method can be validated with events that have been generated under the same assumptions as made in the likelihood calculation , which allows to demonstrate that the measurement method as such is unbiased .    in equation  ( [ pevt.eqn ] ) ,",
    "not all likelihoods @xmath24 necessarily depend on all parameter values ; e.g.  for the measurement of the top quark mass , the likelihood @xmath25 depends on the assumed top quark mass , while the likelihoods for an event to be produced via a background process ( which by definition does not involve top quark production or decay ) do not .",
    "even if a likelihood does depend on a certain parameter , this dependency does not necessarily have to be taken into account explicitly ; for example , for the top quark mass measurement it will be shown in sections  [ enstestljets.sec ] and  [ enstestdilepton.sec ] that the dependency of the likelihoods for background processes on the jet energy scales can be neglected without introducing large biases on the top quark mass and energy scale measurements .",
    "the individual contributions to the likelihood for an observed event @xmath26 to be produced via a given process @xmath19 are described in this section .",

    "effects due to selection cuts or finite detector acceptance are discussed in section  [ method.norml.sec ] .",
    "the transfer function is assumed to factorize into contributions from each measured final - state particle .",
    "aspects to be considered in the transfer function are in principle the measurement of the momentum of a particle ( both of its energy and of its direction ) as well as its identification .",
    "thus @xmath0-tagging information for the jets can be included , which can help to distinguish signal from background events .    in many applications like the description of @xmath1events ,",
    "a number of assumptions can be made  @xcite about how final - state particles are measured in the detector , such that the dimensionality of the integration over the final - state particle phase space described in section  [ method.pprc.sec ] is reduced .",
    "individual particles can be described in the transfer function as follows :    @xmath58    * isolated energetic electrons : * electrons are assumed to be unambiguously identified ( i.e.  an electron is not reconstructed as a muon or a jet ) .",
    "the electron direction and energy are both assumed to be well - measured , i.e.  during integration , the final - state electron is assumed to be identical to the measured particle .",
    "this is justified for @xmath1events since the resolution for electrons is far better than that for jets , and the jet energy resolution will dominate all effects due to the finite detector resolution .",
    "* isolated energetic muons : * as for electrons , muons are assumed to be unambiguously identified , and their directions to be precisely measured .",
    "however , instead of the energy the detector typically yields a measurement of @xmath59 , the muon charge divided by the transverse momentum .",
    "consequently , the muon energy resolution can be poor for high-@xmath54 muons , and thus a transfer function @xmath60 allowing for a finite resolution is introduced .    in the studies presented in this paper ,",
    "the function @xmath61 is used to describe the likelihood that a muon with charge and momentum @xmath62(described by the _ mat_rix element ) is _ rec_onstructed with @xmath63 .",
    "the resolution @xmath64 depends on the pseudorapidity @xmath65 to account for muon tracks at large @xmath66 that do not reach the full radius of the tracking detector .",
    "the parameter values are taken from  @xcite .",
    "* energetic @xmath67 leptons : * events with energetic @xmath67 lepton decays are typically selected if the visible decay products pass a minimum energy cut . in this case , the directions of the visible decay products are close to that of the original @xmath67 lepton , but only a fraction of the @xmath67 energy can be measured in the detector .    in this paper , only leptonic decays @xmath68 are considered , where the symbol @xmath69 denotes an electron or muon . consequently , a transfer function @xmath70 is introduced to describe the likelihood to obtain a charged lepton with a given energy fraction @xmath71 of the decaying @xmath67 lepton . for the study presented here ,",
    "it is parametrized as a @xmath72-orderpolynomial as shown in figure  [ fig : tautransferfunction ] .",
    "the @xmath67 direction is taken to be well approximated by the direction of the reconstructed charged lepton .",
    "likelihood for an electron or muon to carry a given energy fraction of the initial @xmath67 lepton energy.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    for muonic @xmath67 decays , the muon transfer function introduced above in principle has to be taken into account as well to describe the transition from the assumed to the reconstructed muon transverse momentum .",
    "however , muons from @xmath67 decays typically have low enough transverse momenta so that the muon @xmath54 can be assumed to be well - measured in most applications . in the following",
    ", the muon transfer function is omitted for muonic @xmath67 decays .",
    "also , in this study we consider the reconstruction efficiency to be independent of the lepton energy .",
    "* energetic quarks and gluons : * the directions of final - state quarks and gluons are assumed to be well - measured by the jet directions , and transfer functions are introduced for the jet energy measurement . the probability density for a jet energy measurement @xmath73 in the detector if the true quark energy is @xmath74 ( depending on the overall jet energy scale @xmath4or @xmath5 ) is given by the jet energy transfer function @xmath75 . in principle , different transfer functions apply to gluon jets and jets from different quark flavors @xmath76 .    for @xmath77 ,",
    "the jet transfer function is computed as @xmath78 where the factor @xmath79 in the denominator ensures the correct normalization in the absence of selection cuts .    in this paper , the same jet energy transfer function is used to describe light - quark ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath33 , and @xmath82 ) and gluon jetsselection cuts , gluon jets arise in background processes whose description is anyway only approximate ; therefore no separate transfer function for gluon jets is introduced . ] ; an independent transfer function is used for @xmath0-quark jets .",
    "the parametrization of the transfer function follows that of the d0experiment given in  @xcite , with parameters depending on the jet energy and pseudorapidity . in a fraction of those @xmath0jets that contain a semimuonic @xmath0-hadron decay ,",
    "the muon is identified , and these jets could in principle be described with a separate transfer function  @xcite ( while the jets with unidentified semileptonic decays would still have to be described with one function together with all other @xmath0jets ) . in this paper , only one class of @xmath0jets is considered , because the focus is to show how an energy scale for @xmath0jets can be determined at all , and only one overall energy scale factor @xmath4is determined for @xmath0jets .",
    "once this is achieved , it will be possible in principle to determine two independent energy scales for the different classes of reconstructed @xmath0jets .",
    "the ability of the detector to distinguish quarks from gluons and to identify the quark flavor is limited .",
    "nevertheless , identification of @xmath0-quarks ( @xmath0-tagging ) can be useful to distinguish signal and background events , or to identify the correct assignment of final - state quarks to measured jets in final states like lepton+jets@xmath1events that contain both light and @xmath0-quark jets . in this paper ,",
    "we follow the approach introduced in  @xcite to include a term @xmath83 in the transfer function which describes the likelihood for parton @xmath84 with assumed flavor @xmath76 to be reconstructed with @xmath0-tagging information @xmath85 . if @xmath0 tagging is used as a binary decision , then one simply has @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the @xmath0-tagging efficiency for a jet from a parton of flavor @xmath88 .",
    "typically , @xmath0-tagging algorithms yield a continuous output ( for example , the decay length significance of a secondary vertex within a jet , or the output of an artificial neural network ) . instead of a binary decision",
    ", the quantity @xmath83 can be parametrized as a function of this continuous value .",
    "such an approach naturally makes optimal use of the information . as a compromise",
    ", it is possible to use several ( rather than only two ) bins in the output value .",
    "this is the concept used in this publication .",
    "figure  [ btagging.fig ] shows the values @xmath83 for jets in lepton+jets@xmath1events as used in the study presented here , which corresponds to the @xmath0-tagging performance of the d0 experiment  @xcite . for the study in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath83 functions are assumed not to depend on the jet transverse momentum or pseudorapidity , but this will be a straightforward extension of the method for future measurements .",

    ", the output @xmath90 of an artificial neural network used in the d0experiment  @xcite is taken as a concrete example .",
    "the first bin contains jets that fail the @xmath0-tagging preselection .",
    "the structure in the histogram is due to the non - equidistant binning.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    * energetic neutrinos : * neutrinos are not measured in the detector , but still an integration has to be performed over assumed values for all momentum components of all final - state neutrinos in an event . information on neutrino momenta can be partly inferred from mass constraints ( e.g. , @xmath91or @xmath2 in @xmath1events ) .",
    "the additional assumption is made in this paper that events are balanced in the transverse plane , i.e.  that the @xmath1system has zero transverse momentum .",
    "this assumption is dropped in section  [ systuncs.ttj.sec ] , which means that an integration over two additional variables has to be carried out .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in an event is typically inferred from an imbalance in the transverse plane ( non - zero missing transverse momentum @xmath92 ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to parametrize the resolutions of the two @xmath92components since they depend on the resolutions of all other reconstructed objects in the event .",
    "instead , the vector sum of transverse momenta of all reconstructed objects that are not assigned to the final state in question could be considered . in the case of @xmath1events at the tevatron , this would be calorimeter measurements outside of the jets assigned to the @xmath1 final state . in this paper , however , as in  @xcite , no corresponding transfer function factor is introduced .",
    "in addition to the detector resolution , one has to take into account the fact that the particles measured in the detector can not be assigned unambiguously to specific final - state particles .",
    "consequently , all possibilities must be considered , and their contributions to the transfer function summed .",
    "the total transfer function can be written as @xmath93 where the four lines represent the contributions from electrons , muons , tau leptons , and jets , respectively .",
    "it is understood that a term only appears if the corresponding particle is present in the final state under consideration .",
    "the number of possible assignments of reconstructed ( `` rec '' ) particles to final - state particles in the process described by the matrix element ( `` @xmath94 '' ) is denoted by @xmath95 , and @xmath96 stands for one specific permutation .",
    "the symbols @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 stand for the numbers of electrons , muons , tau leptons , and quarks or gluons in the final state . a reconstructed particle is denoted by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , or @xmath84 .",
    "the symbols @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 stand for the corresponding final - state particle assumed in the matrix element integration , which is given by the index @xmath96 of the permutation and the index of the reconstructed particle : @xmath108 ( and accordingly for muons , tau leptons , and jets ) .",
    "the flavor @xmath109 of final - state parton @xmath107 assigned to jet @xmath84 is given by the permutation @xmath96 .",
    "the jet energy scale appropriate for jet @xmath84 ( @xmath4or @xmath5 ) is denoted by @xmath110 and selected according to the assumed flavour @xmath109 . the symbol @xmath85 stands for any output from a @xmath0-tagging algorithm .    because of the assumption that the transfer function factorizes into independent contributions from the final - state particles , it may in principle also depend on @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in a top quark mass measurement , smaller top quark masses correspond to a smaller mean angular separation of jets , which may lead to a broadening of the jet energy resolution .",
    "such effects are however typically small and are therefore neglected in the simplified description of the detector response with transfer functions ; they would implicitly be taken into account in a calibration of the measurement with fully simulated events .",
    "the normalization condition for the likelihood @xmath111for each process is given by @xmath112 where the inclusion of the factor @xmath113 is equivalent to integrating only over those configurations @xmath26 of observed events that pass the event selection criteria .",
    "the normalization condition is fulfilled according to the definition of the observable cross section @xmath114 in equation  ( [ sigmaobs.eqn ] ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath114is intimately related with the normalization of the transfer function .",
    "both aspects are discussed in this section .",
    "the normalization condition of the jet energy transfer function used in previous implementations of the matrix element method  @xcite is given by @xmath115 we call this a _ process - based _ normalization scheme as it reflects the concept that a final - state quark or gluon gives rise to a jet of any energy ( or is not reconstructed as a jet if the energy is below the jet reconstruction threshold of the experiment ) ; thus this normalization scheme does not depend on the event selection cuts .",
    "a modified , _ selection - based _ normalization scheme which simplifies the computation of the normalization integral given in equation  ( [ sigmaobs.eqn ] ) but leaves the likelihood @xmath111unchanged is introduced in this section .",
    "we assume that the event selection requires a reconstructed object for every charged lepton and every quark or gluon in the final state ( this means for example that the presence of four jets is required for lepton+jets@xmath1events ) , and that the jet selection cuts are identical for all jets .",
    "the selection - based normalization of the transfer function is based on the concept that events only enter the analysis if all these reconstructed objects pass the corresponding selection criteria .",
    "this means that every possible partonic final state in the integral in equation  ( [ dsigmapp.eqn ] ) is assumed to yield an observed event that passed the event selection .",
    "thus , a modified jet energy transfer function @xmath116 is introduced in the top quark mass measurement , which satisfies the condition @xmath117 i.e.  the parton under consideration is assumed to have led to a jet that passed the selection cut @xmath118 , where the energy cut normally depends on the polar angle of the jet since a transverse energy cut is used in the event selection .",
    "equation  ( [ tfnormjt.eqn ] ) ensures that in equation  ( [ sigmaobs.eqn ] ) , @xmath119 it is shown in section  [ method.norml.sigmaobs.sec ] that the modified denominator @xmath120 which is then needed in equation  ( [ normpevtp.eqn ] ) to compute the likelihood @xmath111becomes independent of the parameters @xmath14 that describe the detector response .",
    "the effect of this selection - based normalization scheme on the jet energy transfer function @xmath116 is shown in figure  [ tfnormalization.fig](a ) for the double - gaussian function used in this study : if the parton energy is assumed to be very small , then a small reconstructed jet energy just above the cut value is most likely . however , the function is still normalized to unit area as it is assumed that the parton must have given rise to a jet that passed the selection cut ( in this example set at @xmath121 corresponding to @xmath122 for the event selection criteria of section  [ samples.sec ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the jet energy transfer function on the parameters @xmath14 that describe the detector response must also be accounted for as explained in figure  [ tfnormalization.fig](b ) : for every @xmath5hypothesis the same event sample is considered in the measurement , and therefore the event selection ( in this example the minimum jet transverse energy cut ) can not depend on the assumed @xmath5value . for different assumed values of @xmath5 , the @xmath116 curve varies , and the normalization of the curve must be adjusted to ensure that the normalization condition in equation  ( [ tfnormjt.eqn ] ) is satisfied .     jet energy transfer function @xmath116 in the modified normalization scheme .",

    "the @xmath67 energy has to be larger than the energy of the reconstructed lepton .",
    "consequently , the selection - based normalization condition is @xmath129 because of the non - zero lower integration bound the transfer function @xmath130 has to be scaled with an appropriate overall factor that depends on the reconstructed lepton energy and pseudorapidity to arrive at the modified function @xmath131 .    in comparison with the jet energy resolution ,",
    "the muon transverse momentum resolution is good for muons close to the minimum transverse momentum cut , and only a negligible fraction of muons is affected by this cut .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that final - state muons passing the selection cuts are always reconstructed as muons .",
    "thus , a calculation of the normalization corresponding to equation  ( [ tfnormtau.eqn ] ) can be omitted for muons .      to derive the denominator @xmath132with which to normalize the likelihood @xmath111for a given process @xmath19 , it follows from equations  ( [ normcond.eq ] ) , ( [ normpevtp.eqn ] ) , and  ( [ dsigmapp.eqn ] ) that @xmath133 where the normalization condition for the modified transfer function @xmath134 ( equation  ( [ tfnorm_wprime.eqn ] ) ) has been used in the last step .",
    "the quantity @xmath132is thus only a function of the physics parameters @xmath13 , but not of the detector performance parameters @xmath14 .    in the definition of @xmath132 ,",
    "the integral over the observed events @xmath26 is not over the full phase space , but instead only over that part of the phase space that passes the kinematic event selection .",
    "typically , regions of small jet transverse energy @xmath135or large @xmath66 will be excluded from the integration region .    because the normalization of the jet energy transfer function @xmath116 described in section  [ method.norml.tfnormjt.sec ] accounts for the lower jet @xmath135cut , any jet energy scale dependence of @xmath132is eliminated .",
    "in contrast , the jet angular resolution is approximated with a @xmath136 function to save integration time , and this means that the integration over @xmath27 must exclude those angular regions that do not pass the event selection . through the angular acceptance cuts ( and through the matrix element",
    "@xmath137 itself , of course ) , @xmath132still depends on the physics parameters @xmath13 .",
    "a similar argument holds for angular acceptance cuts in the charged lepton selection .",
    "the above argument is only valid if the normalization condition of equation  ( [ tfnorm_wprime.eqn ] ) is fulfilled for the modified transfer function @xmath134 . in practice , this is difficult to implement for event selection cuts based on quantities that depend on more than one reconstructed particle . for example , the @xmath138cut in section  [ samples.sec ] does not fulfill this criterion since it depends on all measured final - state particles .",
    "therefore , an @xmath4dependence of @xmath139is taken into account in the analysis of dilepton @xmath1events described in section  [ enstestdilepton.sec ] . for the measurement with lepton+jetsevents ,",
    "it is shown in section  [ enstestljets.sec ] that the @xmath4and @xmath5dependence of @xmath139can be neglected for the less stringent @xmath138cut applied in the event selection .",
    "it is possible to choose a process - based transfer function normalization according to equation  ( [ tfnormjt_alt.eqn ] ) . in this case , the dependency of the transfer function normalization on the parameters @xmath14 describing the detector resolution is not taken into account .",
    "this means that in the last step of the derivation in equation  ( [ sigmaobs_independent_of_beta.eqn ] ) , a dependency on @xmath14 remains and @xmath114has to vary as a function of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this process - based scheme has the advantage that the transfer function @xmath3 accomodates the possibility of jets not passing the selection cuts . for analyses like @xmath2measurements in @xmath1events",
    "as described in this paper , the number of jets required in the event selection ensures that in any event where this is the case an additional hard parton would have to be produced which yields a jet passing the cuts . in principle",
    ", such events have to be described by the signal process . at the tevatron their contribution to the event sample is so small that they do not have to be accounted for explicitly in the method until the final calibration step .",
    "consequently , the selection - based transfer function normalization described in sections  [ method.norml.tfnormjt.sec ] and  [ method.norml.tfnormmutau.sec ] is chosen for the studies described in this paper , as it eliminates the dependency of @xmath139 on the parameters @xmath14 and thus facilitates the simultaneous measurement of several parameters",
    ". this picture may change for measurements in @xmath1events at the lhc , where initial - state radiation becomes much more relevant .",
    "the normalization of the likelihoods can in principle be determined in the same way for all processes considered . alternatively , if the normalization of the likelihood @xmath140for one specific process @xmath141(for example , the signal process ) has been determined as described above and if the fraction @xmath142of events from that process in the selected sample is left as a free parameter in the analysis , it is possible to relate the absolute normalization of the likelihoods for all other processes to that of process @xmath141 .",
    "one can then make use of the fact that the fit described in section  [ method.mefit.sec ] will yield a signal fraction @xmath142of the sample that is too small if the background likelihood is too large and vice versa , and one can adjust the relative normalization in the validation of the matrix element method until the signal fraction is determined correctly .",
    "this concept can only be applied if the cross - section for the process @xmath141is well - known ( like for example for @xmath1production ) .",
    "it is then helpful in particular if the likelihoods for background processes as implemented in the analysis do not depend on any of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 : in such a case , only one normalization constant needs to be determined for each background process .      for a given sample of selected events ,",
    "the parameters to be measured are determined as those values that maximize the likelihood @xmath7 .",
    "one wants to determine @xmath143 physics parameters , @xmath144 parameters describing the detector resolution , and @xmath145fractions of events from different processes @xmath19 . for every measured event ,",
    "the likelihoods for each process are calculated for an @xmath146-dimensional grid of assumed parameter values . given these grids of likelihood values for each process",
    ", the sample likelihood @xmath147 defined in equation  ( [ lsample.eqn ] ) is available for an @xmath148-dimensional grid of assumed parameter values .    the measurement value of a given parameter @xmath149 and the corresponding uncertainty",
    "are then determined from a one - dimensional likelihood @xmath150 .",
    "the value of @xmath150 is obtained by marginalization of all other parameters ; in practice , this is done by keeping the value of @xmath149 constant , varying the assumed values of all @xmath151 other parameters , and taking the maximum @xmath7value . the one - dimensional function @xmath152 is fitted with a parabola .",
    "the parameter value that minimizes the parabola is taken to be the measurement value , and the measurement uncertainty is given by the parameter values where the fitted parabola rises by @xmath153 above the minimum . by construction , this procedure takes correlations between the parameters into account .      to validate the measurement technique ,",
    "tests are performed with simulated events generated under the assumptions used in the matrix element method , i.  e.  using the same pdf set , matrix element , and transfer function .",
    "a pseudo - experiment emulates a measurement performed on data and consists of events randomly drawn from monte  carloevent pools for signal and background processes .",
    "the numbers of events taken from the different pools are chosen to reflect the fractions observed in the data .",
    "an ensemble of several pseudo - experiments is performed for each of a number of sets of assumed input parameter values .",
    "the range of assumed values is chosen according to previous determinations and the expected precision of the measurement .",
    "taking the results from all ensembles , the following information is obtained :    @xmath58    the relation between the expected ( mean ) measurement values and the corresponding true input values .",
    "it is expected that the method yields unbiased results if the matrix element method reflects the properties of the events .    the distribution of measurement uncertainties as a function of input parameter values .    the width @xmath154 of the pull distribution . to test that the fitted uncertainties describe the actual measurement uncertainty ,",
    "the deviation of the measurement value from the true value is divided by the fitted measurement uncertainty in each pseudo - experiment .",
    "the width of this distribution of deviations normalized by the measurement uncertainties is referred to as _",
    "pull width_. it is expected that @xmath155 if all features of the events are accommodated in the method .    in a similar way , ensemble tests based on fully simulated events can be used to determine any correction of measurement values and fit uncertainties needed when applying the method ( which is based on a simplified detector model ) to real data .",
    "because the computation of likelihoods is time - consuming , the size of the pools of simulated events is usually limited and individual events are allowed to be redrawn , i.e.  to appear several times even in the same pseudo - experiment . this technique maximizes the information about the expected uncertainties and pull widths , but it has to be taken into account when evaluating the uncertainties of the ensemble test results  @xcite .    to summarize , the validation tests described in sections  [ enstestljets.sec ] and  [ enstestdilepton.sec ] each comprise the three following steps :    1 .",
    "likelihood fit : build one pseudo - experiment and determine @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "section  [ method.mefit.sec ] ) ; 2 .",
    "ensemble test : repeat step 1 with 1000 pseudo - experiments and obtain mean results , expected uncertainties , and pull widths ; and 3 .",
    "validation : repeat step 2 for several input parameter values to obtain calibration curves .",
    "as an example for a concrete implementation of the matrix element method described previously , the measurement of the top quark mass in lepton+jetsand dilepton @xmath1events is described in this and the following sections .",
    "the discussion of dilepton events is restricted to events containing one electronic and one muonic @xmath3decay , which yield the most precise top quark mass measurement in dilepton events .",
    "this section summarizes the generation of smeared events to study the top quark mass measurement and introduces the event selection criteria .",
    "the characteristics of lepton+jets@xmath1events at a hadron collider are the presence of one energetic isolated charged lepton , at least four energetic jets ( two of which are @xmath0-quark jets ) , and missing transverse momentum due to the unreconstructed neutrino .",

    "multijet background where one jet mimicks an isolated charged lepton can also enter the event sample .",
    "dilepton @xmath1events are characterized by two oppositely charged energetic isolated leptons ( in the case considered here , one electron and one muon ) , two energetic @xmath0-quark jets , and missing transverse momentum due to the two neutrinos from the @xmath3decays .",
    "the largest physics background in the @xmath156channel is from events with @xmath157 decays where the @xmath158boson is produced in association with two or more jets ; another background channel is the production of two leptonically decaying @xmath3bosons together with two jets .",
    "instrumental background arises from events where a leptonically decaying @xmath3is produced in association with three or more jets , one of which is misidentified as the second isolated charged lepton .    in principle",
    ", events with leptonically decaying @xmath67 leptons from @xmath3decay contribute to both the lepton+jetsand dilepton event samples .",
    "however , because of lower transverse momentum or transverse energy cuts on the charged lepton(s ) in the event selection ( see below ) , these contributions are typically small .",
    "thus , @xmath1events including leptonic @xmath67 decays are not simulated for the study presented here ( whereas in a real measurement , the effect of such decays has to be accounted for ) .    for the study presented here",
    ", events containing a @xmath159 reaction in a @xmath40collision at @xmath6 center - of - mass energy are simulated with the madgraph  @xcite generator .",

    "the alpgen  @xcite program is used to generate events containing a leptonic @xmath3or @xmath158decay in association with additional light partons ; events with @xmath0quarks are simulated by smearing the light partons with the transfer function for @xmath0jets . to simulate the decay of a @xmath67 lepton to an electron or muon in @xmath163events , the @xmath67 transfer function shown in figure  [ fig : tautransferfunction ]",
    "is applied , while the direction of the lepton is left unchanged . for the modeling of the parton distribution functions , the leading - order pdf cteq5l  @xcite is chosen .",
    "multijet background without leptonic @xmath3or @xmath158decay is not simulated because it was shown in  @xcite that its effect on the measurement in the lepton+jetschannel is similar to that of additional @xmath3+jetsbackground+jetsand multijet background by the @xmath3+jetsprocess to calculate the likelihood @xmath7 , and to account for any differences between @xmath3+jetsand multijet background when calibrating the measurement using full simulation . ] .",
    "all simulated events are passed through the parametrized detector simulation discussed in section  [ method.tf.sec ] , which describes the response of the d0detector  @xcite .",
    "no simulation of the parton shower and hadronization is performed since the transfer functions account for their effects in addition to the detector resolution .",
