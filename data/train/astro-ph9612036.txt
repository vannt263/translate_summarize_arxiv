    "blazars vary violently at all wavelengths , with timescales as short as hours  days .",
    "this suggests that the injection mechanism and/or the cooling processes operate on timescales shorter than the light crossing time @xmath0 .",
    "this implies simmetric light curves during rapid flares , as observed during particularly intensive monitoring campaigns . to interpret in detail the variability pattern at different wavelenghts we need to study the time dependent behavior of the emitting particle distribution",
    "* the source , of typical dimension @xmath1 , embedded by a tangled magnetic field @xmath2 , moves relativistically , and the radiation is beamed with a doppler factor @xmath3 .",
    "* relativistic electrons are injected homogeneously throughout the source for a time which can be less than @xmath0 .",
    "* we consider synchrotron and self compton cooling , and particle escape . *",
    "the electron distribution is found by solving the continuity equation : @xmath4 + q(\\gamma)- { n(\\gamma , t ) \\over t_{esc}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the injection term , @xmath6 is the cooling term , and @xmath7 is the escape timescale of the particles , assumed to be independent of their energy .",
    "we solve this equation numerically , according to the scheme proposed by chang & cooper ( 1970 ) .",
    "since the cooling and injection timescales are shorter than @xmath0 , the particle distribution evolves more rapidly than the light crossing time .",
    "_ the observer will see a convolution of different spectra , each produced in a different region of the source_. initially we see only the emission by fresh electrons located in the slice nearest to us .",
    "after a time @xmath0 we see the entire source : the back of it with fresh electrons , and the front of it with older electrons .",
    "in may 1994 mkn 421 underwent a x  ray flare during an high state of the tev emission ( macomb et al .",

    "1 shows the overall spectra taken from macomb et al .",
    "( 1996 ) fitted by two ssc spectra calculated with our program assuming that the particle distribution reached equilibrium .",
    "the two models differ only by the total injected power ( factor 2 ) and the @xmath8 ( factor 3 ) .",
    "takahashi et al . ( 1996 ) studied the time lag between hard and soft x ",
    "rays ( asca data ) , finding a time delay of @xmath91 hour .",
    "the also note that the tev flux varied with approximately the same amplitude of the x  rays , while the optical flux remained quasi constant .",
    "we qualitatively reproduce these features by assuming : i ) injection of a flat power electron distribution ( @xmath10 ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a time equal to @xmath0 ; ii ) @xmath13 cm , @xmath14 g , @xmath15 , @xmath16 erg / s ; iii ) the flaring emission corresponding to the fast varying electron distribution is summed to a constant component .",
    "2 shows the light curves at four different frequencies : note that the soft x  rays lag the hard x",
    " rays ( approximately 1 hour ) , and the optical flux remains quasi constant .",
    "the peak of the optical emission lags the hard x ",
    "rays by @xmath93 hours , while the tev peak has a delay of 2 hours .",
    "the seed photon for the tev emission have ir frequencies , and they lag the x  rays : this is the reason for the delay of the tev emission w.r.t .",
