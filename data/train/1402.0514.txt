    "let us first recall some of the basic components for building up the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in the statistical approach , as oppose to the standard polynomial type parametrizations , based on regge theory at low @xmath0 and counting rules at large @xmath0 .",
    "the fermion distributions are given by the sum of two terms @xcite , the first one , a quasi fermi - dirac function and the second one , a flavor and helicity independent diffractive contribution equal for light quarks . so we have , at the input energy scale @xmath1 , @xmath2 + 1}+ \\frac{\\tilde{a}x^{\\tilde{b}}}{\\exp(x/\\bar{x})+1}~ , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] @xmath3 + 1}+ \\frac{\\tilde{a}x^{\\tilde{b}}}{\\exp(x/\\bar{x})+1}~. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] it is important to remark that @xmath0 is indeed the natural variable , since all sum we will use are expressed in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "notice the change of sign of the potentials and helicity for the antiquarks .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 plays the role of a _ universal temperature _ and @xmath5 are the two _ thermodynamical potentials _ of the quark @xmath6 , with helicity @xmath7 .",
    "we would like to stress that the diffractive contribution occurs only in the unpolarized distributions @xmath8 and it is absent in the valence @xmath9 and in the helicity distributions @xmath10 ( similarly for antiquarks ) .",
    "the _ nine _ free parameters and @xmath11 are fixed by the following normalization conditions @xmath12 , @xmath13 . ] to describe the light quark sector ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the above expressions , were determined at the input scale from the comparison with a selected set of very precise unpolarized and polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data @xcite .",
    "the additional factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 come from the transverse momentum dependence ( tmd ) , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see below ) . for the gluons we consider the black - body inspired expression @xmath25 a quasi bose - einstein function , with @xmath26 , the only free parameter , since @xmath27 is determined by the momentum sum rule .",
    "we also assume a similar expression for the polarized gluon distribution @xmath28 $ ] . for the strange quark distributions , the simple choice made in ref .",
    "@xcite was greatly improved in ref .",
    "our procedure allows to construct simultaneously the unpolarized quark distributions and the helicity distributions .",
    "this is worth noting because it is a very unique situation .",
    "following our first paper in 2002 , new tests against experimental ( unpolarized and polarized ) data turned out to be very satisfactory , in particular in hadronic collisions , as reported in refs .",
    "let us first come back to the important question of the flavor asymmetry of the light antiquarks .",
    "our determination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is perfectly consistent with the violation of the gottfried sum rule , for which we found @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless there remains an open problem with the @xmath0 distribution of the ratio @xmath33 for @xmath34 . according to the pauli principle",
    "this ratio should be above 1 for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the e866/nusea collaboration @xcite has released the final results corresponding to the analysis of their full data set of drell - yan yields from an 800 gev / c proton beam on hydrogen and deuterium targets and they obtain the ratio , for @xmath35 , @xmath33 shown in fig . 1 ( left ) . although the errors are rather large in the high @xmath0 region , the statistical approach disagrees with the trend of the data . clearly by increasing the number of free parameters , it is possible to build up a scenario which leads to the drop off of this ratio for @xmath36 .",
    "for example this was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , as shown by the dashed curve in fig . 1 ( left ) .",
    "there is no such freedom in the statistical approach , since quark and antiquark distributions are strongly related .",
    "one way to clarify the situation is , to improve the statistical accuracy on the drell - yan yields which seems now possible , since there are new opportunities for extending the measurement of the @xmath37 ratio to larger @xmath0 up to @xmath38 , with the ongoing e906 experiment at the 120 gev main injector at fnal @xcite and a proposed experiment at the new 30 - 50 gev proton accelerator at j - parc @xcite .     from e866/nusea at @xmath35 @xcite , with the prediction of the statistical model ( solid curve ) and the set 1 of the parametrization proposed in ref .",

    "@xcite . , title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    another way is to call for the measurement of a different observable sensitive to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "one possibility is the ratio of the unpolarized cross sections for the production of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 collisions , which will directly probe the behavior of the @xmath43 ratio .",
    "let us recall that if we denote @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the @xmath40 rapidity , we have @xcite at the lowest order @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    ", one sees that the predictions are very different .",
    "notice that the energy scale @xmath66 is much higher than in the e866/nusea data , so one has to take into account the @xmath67 evolution . at @xmath42 for @xmath57",
    ", we have @xmath68 and , although the @xmath69 yield is smaller at this energy , the effect on @xmath59 is strongly enhanced , as seen in fig .",

    "@xcite ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the subject of the strange quark distributions is also very important and challenging , in particular because the hermes collaboration has presented recently a new data set at variance with the previous one . for lack of space",
    "we are unable to cover it here .",
    "we now turn to two specific examples of spin - dependent observables to illustrate the predictive power of our approach for helicity quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "first , let us consider the neutron structure function @xmath72 measured in polarized dis with a neutron target .",
    "although it has been measured extensively by different collaborations , some accurate data obtained at jlab , in the low @xmath67 region , have been largely ignored so far @xcite . in fig .",
    "2(left ) we compare our predictions with these data , dominated by @xmath73 and @xmath74 which are negative , and one observes a remarkable agreement .",
    "another example is the helicity asymmetry in the charged - lepton production through production and decay of @xmath69 bosons . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath47 asymmetry is very sensitive to the sign and magnitude of @xmath75 and the succeful results of the statistical approach are displayed in fig .",
    "2(right ) .",
    "the parton distributions @xmath76 of momentum @xmath77 , must obey the momentum sum rule + @xmath78 .",
    "in addition it must also obey the transverse energy sum rule @xmath79 . from the general method of statistical thermodynamics",
    "we are led to put @xmath76 in correspondance with the following expression @xmath80  , where @xmath81 is a parameter interpreted as the transverse temperature .",
    "so we have now the main elements for the extension to the tmd of the statistical pdf .",
    "we obtain in a natural way the gaussian shape with * no * @xmath82 factorization , because the quantum statistical distributions for quarks and antiquarks read in this case @xmath83 @xmath84 here @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are the thermodynamical potentials chosen such that @xmath87 , in order to recover the factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 , introduced earlier .",

    "@xcite).,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    before closing we would like to mention an important point .",
    "so far in all our quark or antiquark tmd distributions , the label `` @xmath96 '' stands for the helicity along the longitudinal momentum and not along the direction of the momentum , as normally defined for a genuine helicity .",
    "the basic effect of a transverse momentum @xmath97 is the melosh - wigner rotation , which mixes the components @xmath98 in the following way @xmath99 , where for massless partons , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 .",
    "it vanishes when either @xmath102 or @xmath103 , the quark longitudinal momentum , goes to infinity .",
    "consequently @xmath104 remains unchanged since @xmath105 , whereas we have @xmath106 .",
    "+ for illustration we display in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath107 , which shows the effect of the melosh - wigner rotation , mainly in the low @xmath0 region . + a new set of pdf is constructed in the framework of a statistical approach of the nucleon .",
    "all unpolarized and polarized distributions depend upon a small number of free parameters , with some physical meaning .",
    "new tests against experimental ( unpolarized and polarized ) data on dis , semi - inclusive dis and hadronic processes are very satisfactory .",
    "it has a good predictive power but some special features remain to be verified , specially in the high @xmath0 region .",
    "the extension to tmd has been achieved and must be checked more accurately together with melosh - wigner effects in the low @xmath0 region , for small @xmath67 . + * acknowledgments * + js is grateful to the organizers of dspin-13 for their warm hospitality at jinr and for their invitation to present this talk .",
