    "<S> the relationship between cosmic ray intensity decreases and solar events is still an open field of space research . in this work a complete study of solar events occurred from january 2003 to december 2005 , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> this three - years time period characterized by an unexpected activity of the sun was divided into 27-day intervals starting from br 2313 ( 06.01.2003 ) to 2353 ( 21.12.2005 ) , generating diagrams of the cosmic ray intensity data recorded at the athens neutron monitor station . </S>",
    "<S> this station is working at an altitude of 260 m and cut - off rigidity 8.53gv provided to the internet high - resolution data in real - time . </S>",
    "<S> a mapping of all available solar and interplanetary events , such as solar flares with importance m and x , coronal mass ejections ( halo and partial ) was done . </S>",
    "<S> as we are going down from the solar maximum to the declining phase of the 23rd solar cycle , a statistical overview of the corresponding relationship among these phenomena , the significant percentage of the connection of halo cmes and solar flares and the respective connection to forbush decreases on yearly and monthly basis are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the close association , as well as a probable quantitative analysis , between solar events is being denoted . </S>",
    "<S> the role of extreme solar events occurred in october / november 2003 and january 2005 is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> obtained results may be useful for predictions of transient solar events and space weather forecasting . </S>"
