    "in recent past the analog computers were the only tool for solving the mathematical problems which could not be solved analytically .",
    "the analog computer is a device ( typically - an electric circuit ) whose temporal dynamics is described by equations similar to those which are to be solved .",
    "the analog computers have the virtue of being simple .",
    "the main defect of analog computers is absence of universality .",
    "for this reason for solving of any particular problem one must design a special analog computer suited for solving only this particular problem . the impressive achievements of semiconductor technology of recent decades made it possible to create a digital universal computer based on microprocessor - a programmable electronic device which is millions times more complicated than any of analog computers but allows one to solve wide range of problems just by entering of appropriate program . despite the great power of modern digital universal microprocessors one can point out some problems whose solution require excessive time or even impossible .",
    "having in mind one of these problems one can put the following question : is it possible ( using the fantastic facilities of up - to - date technology ) to create a specialized device ( specialized processor ) suited for solving only this particular problem ?",
    "imagine that we have constructed the specialized processor for solving of many - particle problem of atomic physics . in our opinion despite the loss of universality this processor would be of great interest .",
    "below we suggest some algorithm for solving the problem of phase transition in ising magnetic .",
    "this algorithm can be directly implemented by means of conventional digital computer . on the other hand in our opinion",
    "it is quite possible to create the specialized processor working according to this algorithm but much faster than conventional universal processor .",
    "this processor being much more simple device than the universal processor allows one to solve the problem of phase transition in ising system and to obtain an arbitrary values of interest ( energy , magnetisation , heat capacity ) .",
    "we estimate the complexity of this processor to be comparable with that of modern memory devices .",
    "let us consider a trigger  scheme with two stable states which we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "this trigger and spin @xmath1 have much in common and below we will not differ these two .",
    "suppose this trigger can change its state only when clock pulse coming .",
    "we consider the train of clock pulses to be equidistant in time .",
    "consider the probability for trigger to change its state ( the probability of corresponding spin flip ) be depending on the trigger s state before clock pulse coming .",
    "consequently the probability @xmath2 for trigger to switch from state @xmath3 differs from that @xmath4 to switch from state @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "let these probabilities obey : @xmath7    equation ( 1 ) has the sense of detail equilibrium principle for spin @xmath1 in magnetic field @xmath8 and in contact with thermostat with inverse temperature @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath10 the normalization constant @xmath11 must obey :    @xmath12    if we now consider the statistical ensemble of such triggers then the kinetic equations for average number @xmath13 of triggers in states @xmath0 have the form :    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16  is increment of number of triggers in state @xmath17 after @xmath18-th clock pulse coming , @xmath19  number of triggers in state @xmath17 to the moment of @xmath18-th clock pulse coming .",
    "the steady state solution of this equation has the form : @xmath20    this corresponds to thermal equilibrium state of spin system in the external magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "now let us consider the case of ising magnetic i.e. the lattice comprised of @xmath21 spins ( triggers ) coupled to each other in such a way that the magnetic field acting on the arbitrary spin is defined by configuration of the rest spins in the lattice . in the simplest case the magnetic field @xmath22 acting on spin with number @xmath18 is produced by its nearest neighbours and if we denote the set of nearest neighbours by @xmath23 then :    @xmath24    here the constant @xmath25 characterize interspin coupling . by the analogy with the aforesaid let us consider the following dynamics of this system .",
    "the clock pulses act sequentially on all the spins ( triggers ) in the lattice  we call this _",
    "round trip_. during the round trip any spin ( say @xmath18-th ) may be overturned with probability defined by equation ( 1 ) with magnetic field @xmath22 defined by formula ( 5 ) .",
    "we are interesting in the dynamics of this system under the action of the train of round trips . for the above dynamics of this `` ising magnetic '' ( consisting of triggers controlled by clock pulses ) we",
    "now will obtain the kinetic equation for density matrix and will show that its steady state solution corresponds to thermal equilibrium . by the analogy with real magnetic",
    "let us describe the state of our `` magnetic '' ( consisting of triggers ) by the wavefunction whose @xmath18-th argument describe the state of @xmath18-th spin ( trigger ) :    @xmath26    introduce @xmath27  operator of @xmath18-th spin flip : @xmath28    let us introduce the statistical ensemble of ising magnetics and let @xmath29 be the number of magnetics in state @xmath30 in this ensemble .",
    "up to normalization factor the quantities @xmath29 are represent the diagonal elements of the density matrix of ising magnetic .",
    "let us consider @xmath31  the increment of @xmath32 when clock pulse act on @xmath18-th spin ( trigger )    @xmath33    here @xmath34  is the probability of transition from @xmath30-state to @xmath35-state when clock pulse act on @xmath18-th spin . in accordance with the above dynamics of ising magnetic the only non - zero probabilities are :",
    "@xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38 the last equality follows from the fact that the field acting on @xmath18-th spin in states @xmath39 and @xmath30 is the same while the value of @xmath18-th spin has the opposite sign ( i.e. @xmath40 ) . then using equation",
    "( 8) one can see that    @xmath41\\ ] ]    let us show that this equation has the steady state solution in the form :    @xmath42    where @xmath43  is the hamiltonian of ising magnetic : @xmath44 we need to calculate @xmath45 . to do this note that : @xmath46    now calculating @xmath45 by equation ( 12 ) and substituting the result in to equation ( 11 ) it is easy to see that when @xmath47 the right part of equation ( 11 ) vanishes .",
    "so we see that ( 12 ) is the steady state solution of ( 11 ) and represent thermal equilibrium density matrix of ising magnetic .",
    "thus the above algorithm of sequential round trips prepare the system of coupled triggers in thermal equilibrium state . for transition probabilities",
    "be less than unit the value of @xmath11 should obey :    @xmath48    here @xmath49  is the number of nearest neighbours . in our opinion",
    "it is possible to create a specialized processor working in accordance with this algorithm",
    ". the described algorithm can be implemented on conventional digital computer . in this case",
    "@xmath11 should take the maximum possible value @xmath50 for system to relax as fast as possible .",
    "in relaxed system one can observe magnetisation @xmath51 , energy ( 13 ) , heat capacity @xmath52 , an arbitrary correlation functions .    to demonstrate the aforesaid algorithm we simulate the phase transition in two - dimensional ising magnetic by means of conventional computer .",
    "fig.1 shows the temperature dependence of heat capacity ( top ) , magnetisation ( middle ) and energy ( bottom ) calculated for the case of @xmath53 ( ferromagnetic ) .",
    "calculations were performed for lattice with sizes @xmath54 .",
    "the procedure was as follows . at the beginning",
    "the system was prepared in the state with magnetisation close to its ultimate value @xmath55 and with temperature much lower than the temperature of phase transition @xmath56 .",
    "after that the above algorithm started with gradually increasing temperature @xmath57 .",
    "when temperature becomes close to @xmath56 the magnetisation vanishes and heat capacity takes its maximum value .",
    "the value of @xmath56 obtained in our calculations is in agreement with the exact formula of kramers and wannier @xcite .",
    "the similar calculations can be performed for the case of _ zero _ initial magnetisation @xmath58 . in this case",
    "total magnetisation is zero for all temperatures .",
    "fig.2 shows the spatial distribution of 2d magnetisation below @xmath56 ( top picture , the domains are clearly seen ) and above @xmath56 ( bottom ) . the heat capacity and",
    "energy temperature behaviour is similar to that in fig.1 .",
    "the algorithm described can be directly generalized for the case of ising system with an arbitrary interspin interaction @xmath59 : @xmath60 to do this one should use the effective magnetic field in the form @xmath61 instead equation ( 5 ) .",
    "possibly the described algorithm may be useful for checking the gauge theories of critical phenomena @xcite . in this case",
    "the duality of some gauge models with respect to ising system is exploited .",
    "the similar algorithms were described in @xcite .",
    "to check the above algorithm let us consider the exactly solvable one - dimensional ising magnetic with nearest neighbours interaction .",
    "this problem was solved by ising @xcite but above algorithm provide a simple way to obtain formulas ( 27 ) for correlation functions which are not very popular . in the case of 1d ising magnetic with nearest neighbours interaction the field acting on the @xmath18-th spin can be calculated by formula ( 5 ) as :      suppose the clock pulse acts on @xmath18-th spin ( trigger ) .",
    "let us calculate the increment @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an arbitrary function of of all spin variables except @xmath65 .",
    "multiplying both parts of equation ( 11 ) by @xmath66 and summing over all states @xmath30 we obtain :        passing from summation over @xmath30 to summation over @xmath69 in the second sum ( @xmath65 should be replaced by @xmath70 ) , denoting @xmath71 and using the relation @xmath72 we obtain : @xmath73 \\rangle=\\ ] ] @xmath74 hence in the equilibrium state : @xmath75        this function depends only on the difference @xmath77 of its indexes .",
    "let @xmath78 in equation ( 21 ) .",
    "then we have : @xmath79 to calculate the correlation function entering the last term let @xmath80 in equation ( 21 ) .",
    "we have : @xmath81 hence : @xmath82\\hskip0.5mm\\hbox{th}\\hskip0.3mm\\theta.\\ ] ]                h.a.kramers and g.h.wannier , statistics of two - dimensional ferromagnet , physical review * 60 * , 252,(1941 ) . e.ising , zeits . f. physik , * 31 * , 253 , ( 1925 ) . m. caselle , m. hasenbusch and m. panero , jhep 0301 ( 2003 ) 057 [ arxiv : hep - lat/0211012 ] .",
