    "fanaroff - riley sources of type i and ii ( fri - ii ) are radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) displaying large - scale jets that interact with the surrounding ism / icm medium.@xcite .",
    "the study of the extended emission in fri / ii sources can be used to derive the properties of the flows and the surrounding medium , and to determine the conditions for particle acceleration . in this",
    "regard a simple evolutionary model can be used to conclude that thermal x - ray emission produced in the shell could be detected only for dense enough media even for powerful frii jets,@xcite whilst thermal mev radiation from the cocoon region would be significant only for sources with ages @xmath0.@xcite .",
    "non - thermal radiation can also be produced in the jet / medium interaction regions .",
    "x - ray synchrotron and/or ic emission has been observed in several sources ( see e.g. ) , and the _ fermi _ collaboration recently reported the detection of extended gev emission in the radio lobes of cen  a , demonstrating that acceleration up to very high energies is indeed taking place in the disrupted jet region.@xcite numerical simulations , on the other hand , have demonstrated to be a powerful tool to study the jet / medium interactions .",
    "perucho & mart ( 2007 ) performed a simulation aimed to test the fri jet evolution paradigm.@xcite we computed the thermal and non - thermal emission from fri sources obtained with a radiative model adapted from bordas et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that takes as input the results of those simulations as input and the radiation model used to characterize the conditions of the shocked regions.@xcite below , we briefly introduce the numerical simulations and the radiation model used .",
    "we then discuss the obtained results and the relevance of the thermal and non - thermal radiation at different energy bands . for a more extended discussion ,",
    "the reader is referred to perucho & mart ( 2007 ) and bordas et al .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations of perucho & mart ( 2007 ) have been used to characterize the physical properties of the jet / medium shocked regions.@xcite the jet is injected in the numerical grid at @xmath1 from the active nucleus , with a radius of @xmath2 .",
    "the ambient medium , composed by neutral hydrogen , has a profile in pressure ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "the jet , leptonic in composition , has an initial velocity @xmath3 , a density ratio with respect to the ambient @xmath4 , a pressure ratio with the ambient @xmath5 , and temperature @xmath6 , resulting in a kinetic luminosity @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "further details on the simulation code can be found in .",
    "regarding the radiative code , we used a simplified one - zone model to study the emission properties of both shell and cocoon regions .",
    "the injected non - thermal luminosity is 10% of the total jet kinetic luminosity @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath10 has been fixed taking the magnetic energy density to be 10% of the ram / thermal pressure . concerning particle acceleration ,",
    "the recollimation shock is assumed to be the accelerator of particles in the cocoon region .",
    "we use a relativistic approach in this case , with an acceleration rate @xmath11 with @xmath12 . for the bow shock ,",
    "we have adopted instead a non - relativistic approach in view of the lower shock velocities @xmath13  cm  s@xmath8 .",
    "the particle energy distribution at a given time , @xmath14 , is calculated considering the injection ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ) , at any time @xmath17 .",
    "maximum particle energies , @xmath18 , vary also along time , through the magnetic field , the accelerator size and the shock velocity dependence .",
    "further details on the radiative code can be found in and .",
    "the non - thermal spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for the cocoon and the shell , at @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21  yr , are shown in the left and center panels of fig .",
    "[ thermal_and_non_thermal_sed ] .",
    "the obtained radio and x - ray synchrotron luminosities in both regions are at the level of @xmath22  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "the approximate constancy of the x - ray luminosities with time is due to the fact that particles have reached the steady state at @xmath17 through synchrotron cooling and the assumed constancy of @xmath23 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath10 with time , and therefore the growth of @xmath24 , is compensated by the increase of time available for cooling .",
    "the ic luminosity grows as long as this process becomes more efficient compared to synchrotron and adiabatic cooling , which is shown by the decrease of @xmath25 from @xmath26 ( @xmath27  yr ) to 4 ( @xmath21  yr ) .",
    "the cocoon and the shell have similar he luminosities , but the cocoon is a few times brighter at vhe than the shell due to the higher maximum energies that particles can attain in the former . in both regions",
    "the bolometric ic luminosities grow similarly with time , reaching @xmath28 and @xmath29  erg  s@xmath8 at he and vhe , respectively .",
    "the lightcurves for the luminosities in radio ( at 5  ghz ) , x - rays ( 110  kev ) , he ( 0.1 - 100  gev ) and vhe ( 0.1100  tev ) , for the cocoon and the shell , are presented in fig .  [ nonthermal_lc ] .",
    "they show in more detail the time behavior of the non - thermal radiation at different wavelengths discussed above .",
    "the complex and smooth shape of the lightcurves , most clear for the he and the vhe emission , is a consequence of the hydrodynamical evolution of the whole interaction structure propagating in an inhomogeneous external medium .",
    "thermal emission has been studied for the shell , much denser than the cocoon .",
    "we have only considered thermal bremsstrahlung emission , although we note that recombination radiation could also be significant ( with luminosities @xmath30  erg  s@xmath8 , where @xmath31 is the shell volume filled with electrons and ions with particle densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , and @xmath34 is the ion charge @xcite ) .",
    "we considered two separate regions : one , cooler ( ultraviolet -uv-/soft x - rays ) but brighter , corresponds to the averaged shell conditions ( @xmath35 ) , and another one , fainter but hotter ( hard x - rays ) , corresponds to a region close to the apex of the bow shock , with properties close to those given by the rankine - hugoniot ( @xmath36 ) conditions .",
    "the volume of the latter region is about @xmath37% of that of the whole shell .",
    "figure  [ thermal_and_non_thermal_sed ] , right panel , shows the thermal seds for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21  yr .",
    "the slowdown of the bow shock and the velocity dependence of the postshock temperature , @xmath38 , leads to a decrease in the peak of the thermal emission with time .",
    "however , the overall luminosity increases as the source gets older , from @xmath39  erg  s@xmath8 to few times @xmath29  erg  s@xmath8 , since the bremsstrahlung time - scale is @xmath40 at any source age , with the shell and the hot postshock region components peaking from soft x - rays to uv and from hard to soft x - rays , respectively .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung increases from @xmath19 to @xmath41  yr , then the luminosity slightly decreases until @xmath42  yr , when a transition in the external medium from the denser galaxy core to the rarefied galaxy group medium is produced , and increases again afterwards .",
    "the component @xmath35 dominates the thermal bolometric luminosity in young sources , but the component @xmath36 becomes similarly bright at @xmath43  yr .",
    "our results can be discussed on the ground of the thermal and non - thermal fluxes predicted at different energy bands . in radio , the cocoon dominates with fluxes up to @xmath44mpc@xmath45  erg  @xmath46  s@xmath47  jy at 5  ghz from a region of few times @xmath48mpc@xmath49 of angular size .",
    "this radio fluxes are similar to those observed for instance in 3c  31 and 3c  15,@xcite.the shell radio flux is sligthly below the cocoon one , although limb brightening may enhance its detectability .",
    "the radio lightcurve is quite steady , since the accumulation of electrons compensates the weakening of the magnetic field with @xmath17 .    at x - rays ,",
    "the different thermal emitting regions in the shell would lead to a bolometric flux from @xmath50mpc@xmath45 ( @xmath27  yr ) to a few times @xmath51mpc@xmath45  erg  @xmath46  s@xmath8 ( @xmath52  yr ) in 3c 15 .",
    "the hard x - rays would be located at the apex of the bow shock , with a typical angular size of a few @xmath53mpc@xmath49 ( for @xmath54  yr ) , whereas lower energy x - rays would come from the whole shell , with of a few @xmath48mpc@xmath49 . regarding non - thermal x - rays",
    ", the cocoon dominates the total output , with fluxes @xmath55mpc@xmath45  erg  @xmath46  s@xmath8 , although limb brightening effects may again increase the shell brightness .",
    "in fact , in the case of cen  a , the shell seems to be the dominant source of non - thermal x - rays.@xcite this difference could be explained by a higher @xmath56 in the shell of that source .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray fluxes @xmath57  erg  @xmath46  s@xmath8 of 3c 15 ( see e.g. ) imply a non - thermal luminosity of @xmath58  erg  s@xmath8 at 300  mpc , in good agreement with the values predicted here .",
    "furthermore , synchrotron emission concentrated around the recollimation shock is compatible with the large - scale jet x - ray emission found in 3c  31.@xcite if a strong recollimation shock is indeed the origin of these large - scale jet x - rays , then the hypothesis that jet disruption in 3c  31 is caused by shock triggered instabilities is favored against stellar wind mass - load.@xcite finally , we note that for sources older than those considered here and/or lower @xmath10-values , the synchrotron emission would be less relevant and ic would dominate the x - ray output .",
    "the moderate velocities of the bow shock found in the numerical simulations prevents thermal photons from reaching energies as high as those discussed in . in the gamma - ray domain ,",
    "the sed is close to flat at he , and becomes steeper at vhe .",
    "we have not accounted for the gamma - ray absorption induced by the extragalactic background light , which would become significant at distances larger than 100  mpc . the overall emission increases with time mainly due to the increasing efficiency of the ic channel ( considering the cosmic microwave background only ) as compared with synchrotron and adiabatic losses .",
    "gamma - ray fluxes for a source with @xmath54  yr are around @xmath59  erg  @xmath46  s@xmath8 . at he ,",
    "such a source may require very long exposures to be detected by , e.g. , _ fermi _ , unless it is very nearby ( as it is the case of cen  a , see ) or shows a higher non - thermal efficiencies and/or jet power . at vhe , the fluxes could be observed by the current cherenkov telescopes , although the extension of the source , of tens of arcminutes at 100  mpc , and the steep spectrum above @xmath60  gev , may make a detection possible only after a long exposure .",
    "the forthcoming cta observatory may however allow the detection of vhe emission from fri jet lobes , and possibly carry out energy - dependent morphological studies .    from our study",
    "we conclude that , for moderate non - thermal luminosities , radio lobes of fri radio galaxies are good candidates to be detected in the whole spectral range , with the radiation appearing extended in most of the energy bands .",
    "soft x - rays will be likely dominated by synchrotron emission up to ages @xmath61  yr , with ic tending to be dominant for older sources .",
    "thermal x - rays seem unavoidable and may dominate in hard x - rays in old sources even if a non - thermal component is present . the low surface brightness may require long observation times for the detection in x- and gamma - rays , although the steady nature of these sources can help in this regard .",
