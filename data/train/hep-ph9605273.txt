    "the measurement of the @xmath7 width at the cern large electron - positron collider @xcite has shown conclusively that there are three generations of light neutrinos .",
    "however , the problem as to whether the neutrinos have non - zero mass and mixing , as is the case for quarks , remains one of the most prominent experimental and theoretical problems in particle physics .    on the one hand",
    ", there is a vast and variegated set of experimental information , ranging from the negative results of laboratory neutrino oscillation searches at accelerators and reactors , to the possible indications for flavor transition processes in natural beams such as solar and atmospheric neutrinos . on the other hand , current theoretical models ( e.g. ,",
    "the see - saw mechanism @xcite ) allow many different textures for the three - generation neutrino mass matrix .",
    "thus , it seems appropriate , at this stage , to keep to a minimum the number of _ a priori _ assumptions in the interpretation of the experimental results .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the three - flavor mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite neutrino oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the only hypothesis that we make is to assume a neutrino mass spectrum as in fig .  1",
    ". more precisely , we assume one of the two independent square mass differences , @xmath1 , to be very large ( more than one order of magnitude higher ) as compared to the smallest one , @xmath0 , which drives the matter - enhanced oscillations .    at zeroth order in @xmath3 , the relevant msw parameters ( see sec .",
    "iii ) are @xmath0 and two mixing angles , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , ranging in the first quadrant @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we introduce new graphical representations of the parameter space @xmath6 , that prove useful in analyzing the properties of the three - flavor msw probability , as well as in showing the detailed results of fits to the experimental data .",
    "the parameter space is studied exhaustively , and all the solutions are discussed thoroughly .",
    "we find three - flavor solutions to the solar neutrino problem that are considerably different from the usual two - flavor results .",
    "the present study is more complete and detailed than previous three - flavor phenomenological analyses of the solar neutrino problem performed by other authors @xcite and by ourselves @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper is part of a wider research program , in which we intend to analyze the world neutrino oscillation data under the sole hypothesis represented by the spectrum in fig .  1",
    ". the analysis of the most constraining accelerator and reactor experiments has already been completed @xcite .",
    "we discuss the link between the information obtained in the present work from solar neutrinos and the results obtained in @xcite from laboratory oscillation searches .",
    "concerning atmospheric neutrinos , a complete three - flavor analysis ( partially addressed in @xcite ) is in progress .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "ii we review the current theoretical expectations and experimental observations of the solar neutrino fluxes , and show for completeness the usual two - generation msw fits to the data . in sec .",
    "iii we present the three - flavor oscillation formalism and show the new graphical representations of the parameter space .",
    "the properties of the @xmath9 survival probability are also discussed . in sec .",
    "iv we explore the parameter space exhaustively , and find the three - flavor solutions to the solar neutrino problem . both in sec .",
    "iii and in sec .",
    "iv we show how solar neutrino results can be compared to the information coming from accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "we conclude and summarize our work in sec .",
    "in this section we present the experimental data used in this work , and compare them with the theoretical expectations .",
    "particular attention is paid to correlation effects .",
    "although our paper is focused on the three - flavor msw mechanism , we also show , for the sake of completeness , our fit to the data in the simpler and more familiar two - generation approach .",
    "there are four operating solar neutrino experiments : the homestake @xcite chlorine ( cl ) detector , the gallex @xcite and sage @xcite gallium ( ga ) detectors , and the kamiokande @xcite water - cherenkov detector .",
    "the observed solar neutrino rates are shown in table  i , along with the corresponding theoretical values as predicted in the recent refined standard solar model ( ssm ) by bahcall and pinsonneault ( bp ) @xcite .",
    "the significant deficit of observed neutrinos constitutes the well - known `` solar neutrino problem '' @xcite .",
    "the information contained in table  i does not characterize completely the significance of the solar neutrino problem , since the theoretical uncertainties ( last column of table  i ) are not independent .",
    "it has been shown in a previous work @xcite that the correlation of the uncertainties can be calculated analytically , starting from the errors affecting the ssm input parameters and the neutrino capture cross - sections .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the experimental and theoretical @xmath10 c.l",
    ".  contours ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) for any couple of experiments ( the gallex and sage data have been combined quadratically ) .",
    "the projections of the ellipses onto the coordinate axes represent , with good approximation , the @xmath13 errors for each experiment separately .",
    "notice the strong correlation of the theoretical errors .",
    "if the correlations were neglected , the theoretically allowed regions would be larger and the discrepancy with the experiments would be underestimated @xcite .",
    "the last relevant piece of data is the night - day @xmath14 asymmetry of the solar neutrino flux as measured in the kamiokande detector @xcite : @xmath15the above value is consistent with no asymmetry ( i.e. , no oscillations ) , and thus contributes to exclude a part of the neutrino oscillation parameter space .",
    "the msw mechanism @xcite of matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations is one of the most promising candidates for the solution of the solar neutrino problem ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . in the hypothesis that only two neutrino generations are involved in the @xmath9 transitions , the relevant parameters are one mass square difference , @xmath0 , and one mixing angle , @xmath4 .    even in the simple two - family scenario , the calculation of the electron neutrino survival probability , @xmath16 , as well as the data analysis ,",
    "are not trivial tasks and require refined computer codes . we take this opportunity to mention a few state - of - the - art features of our codes .",
    "we smear @xmath16 over the neutrino production region in the most general way , i.e. , we also consider neutrino production points off the line that joins the center of the sun and the detector .",
    "this requires a double ( radial and azimuthal ) space integration in the sun , as well as the evaluation of the solar electron density gradient along off - radial trajectories ( instead of the simple derivative ) .",
    "the possibility of a double resonance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is included .",
    "we also include the ( computer time - consuming ) earth regeneration effect @xcite at each detector location , and in particular we calculate the night - day asymmetry @xcite at the kamiokande site . the earth electron density is modeled as a step function with five steps @xcite , corresponding to the relevant radial shells @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties and their correlation effects are taken into account in the statistical @xmath17-analysis of the data @xcite .",
    "the results of our two - flavor analysis are shown in fig .",
    "the thick , solid lines represent the contours of the regions allowed at @xmath18 c.l.(@xmath19 , @xmath12 ) . in the first four panels ,",
    "dotted lines represent curves of iso - signal . in the last two panels ,",
    "all data are combined without and with theoretical errors , and the allowed regions at @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath10 c.l .",
    "are shown .",
    "notice the widening of the `` small '' and `` large '' mixing angle solutions when the theoretical uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "a third solution appears at @xmath10 c.l .  for large angles and small @xmath0 .",
    "when all the uncertainties are included , the @xmath17 function reaches its minimum , @xmath21 , at @xmath22 and @xmath23 ev@xmath24 . the secondary ( large angle ) minimum is reached at @xmath25 and @xmath26 ev@xmath24 , with a value @xmath27not a bad fit .    the msw solutions in fig .",
    "3 compare well with the most recent two - generation analyses of the solar neutrino problem @xcite , modulo small differences due to the input data and their treatment .",
    "in particular , we have verified that , excluding the earth regeneration effect , our results become very similar to those obtained very recently by bahcall and krastev in @xcite , where the same solar model and experimental data were used as input .",
    "in this section we recall the formalism that will be used in the three - flavor analysis , under the hypothesis that the neutrino mass spectrum is as in fig .  1 .",
    "we introduce new graphical representations of the parameter space , and use them to discuss the properties of the three - flavor msw probability @xmath16 .      in the general three - generation case ,",
    "the flavor eigenstates @xmath28 @xmath29 are a superposition of three mass eigenstates @xmath30 @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "the ( unitary ) neutrino mixing matrix @xmath33 is usually parameterized in the same way as the standard cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix in the quark sector @xcite , involving three mixing angles , @xmath34 $ ] , and one cp - violating phase , @xmath35 . redefining the angles as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , the standard parameterization reads : @xmath39 permutations of the mass eigenstate labels @xmath40 do not change the physics , provided that the mixing angles @xmath41 are left to range in the first quadrant @xcite .",
    "the parameter set is completed by two independent neutrino square mass differences , that we write as : @xmath42so that the general three - flavor parameter space is @xmath43 .    in principle , a complete phenomenological analysis of three - flavor neutrino oscillations should span the entire 6-dimensional manifold @xmath43 .",
    "this task would be exceedingly difficult  and perhaps not really useful  at this time , due to vastness of the parameter space , as opposed to the scarcity of evidences in favor of neutrino oscillations .",
    "a much more manageable framework is obtained under the simple hypothesis that the mass spectrum has the property shown in fig .  1 : @xmath2 . the two cases ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 lead to the same solar neutrino physics",
    ". we will always refer to ( a ) in the following , and conventionally label the mass eigenstates in the order of increasing mass @xmath44 . in this case , as far as solar neutrinos are concerned , the two quasi - degenerate mass eigenstates @xmath45 and @xmath46 participate actively to matter - enhanced transitions , while the `` lone '' state @xmath47 is a spectator neutrino that reveals its presence only through the mixing @xcite .    at zeroth order in @xmath3 ,",
    "the following properties hold ( see @xcite and references therein ) : ( 1 ) solar neutrino experiments probe only the subspace @xmath6 ; ( 2 ) terrestrial ( i.e. , accelerator , reactor , atmospheric ) neutrino experiments probe only the subspace @xmath48 ; ( 3 ) effects related to the cp - violating phase @xmath35 are unobservable , so that the mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be taken as real for our purposes .",
    "in other words , solar neutrino experiments explore the space @xmath49 that is the small mass square difference and the three matrix elements related to @xmath9 ( the fast @xmath1-driven oscillations being effectively averaged out ) @xcite .",
    "terrestrial ( accelerator , reactor , atmospheric ) neutrino experiments explore instead the space @xmath50 that is the large mass square difference and the three matrix elements related to @xmath47 ( the slow @xmath0-driven oscillations being effectively frozen ) @xcite .",
    "the five mixing matrix elements @xmath51 and @xmath52 probed by solar and terrestrial oscillation searches satisfy the two unitarity conditions :    @xmath53    @xmath54    in @xcite it has been shown that eq .",

( 7 ) with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . these curves separate the zones where the propagation is non - resonant from those where it is resonant , as indicated in all panels . the behavior of @xmath60 is most interesting near the curve at @xmath95 and in the resonance region .",

    "it may be said , in a figurative way , that the msw mechanism `` cuts '' the @xmath78 plane along the dashed lines at @xmath97 and @xmath95 , `` separates '' the edges ( that would coincide for vacuum oscillations ) and `` fills '' the cut zone with a new resonant region where the survival probability can be much lower than in the vacuum case .",
    "the probabilities in the `` old '' regions at the right and left of the two dashed lines are only weakly ( adiabatically ) different from the corresponding vacuum oscillation values .",
    "we finally show in fig .  8",
    "the behavior of @xmath60 for six representative values of @xmath5 , in a bilogarithmic @xmath100 mass - mixing plane ( a perhaps more familiar representation ) . as in the previous figure , the two thick , dashed lines correspond to the curves at @xmath97 and @xmath95 , that separate non - resonant and resonant propagation regions .",

    "7 and  8 for @xmath102 .",
    "the local discrepancy with the exact probability is , however , unimportant in the calculation of the neutrino rates , being effectively suppressed by the integration over the neutrino production region and energy spectrum , and being confined to values of @xmath4 where no solution to the solar neutrino problem is found .",

    "the obvious condition that @xmath111 ( the vertical coordinate ) must be the same in both figures imposes a strong compatibility constraint .",
    "this constraint eliminates some of the solutions that are individually allowed by solar or terrestrial neutrino oscillation searches .",
    "for instance , the regions allowed by accelerator and reactor data at very large @xmath111 ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) are never allowed by solar neutrino data , that keep @xmath111 below @xmath136 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath1 is in the range of sensitivity of accelerator and reactor oscillation searches , then the comparison of terrestrial and solar data requires relatively small values of @xmath5 .",
    "another example is that the msw - allowed values @xmath137 ev@xmath24 and @xmath138@xmath139 ev@xmath24 are not compatible with accelerator and reactor data for @xmath140 ev@xmath24",
    ". one can explore various other ( in)compatibility situations for the @xmath131 cases of @xmath132 that can be extracted from the figures discussed above .",
    "we recall that the only hypothesis adopted in our analysis is @xmath2 .",
    "virtually , all see - saw models of neutrino mass generation satisfy this condition .",
    "model builders can thus check if their favorite values of @xmath141 fall in the allowed regions determined in this work and in @xcite . here",
    "we discuss briefly the `` threefold maximal mixing '' model , recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "the maximal mixing scenario is realized in the centers of the triangles in fig .  5 , that is for @xmath142 or , equivalently , for @xmath143 .",
    "figure  9 shows that the combination @xmath144 is excluded at more than @xmath10 c.l . by solar @xmath145 data ( within the msw approach ) .",
    "the maximal mixing scenario could be reconciled with solar @xmath145 data only by dropping the homestake measurement , that keeps @xmath4 below @xmath72 . from fig .  10 in @xcite",
    ", it follows that accelerator and reactor data exclude the maximal mixing combination @xmath146 for all values of @xmath1 in their present sensitivity range ( @xmath147 ev@xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the maximal mixing is not supported by all solar neutrino data , and is ( trivially ) compatible with accelerator and reactor experiments only below their present @xmath1-sensitivity limits .",
    "we have discussed the three - flavor msw mechanism , in the hypothesis @xmath148 and for mixing angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 in their maximal range @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "new useful graphical representations of the parameter space ( figs .",
    "46 ) have been introduced .",
    "a complete analysis of present data in the mass - mixing space @xmath6 has been performed , and the solutions have been thoroughly discussed .",
    "the data favor the two - generation limit @xmath149 , but a wide range of three - flavor solutions are allowed up to @xmath150 .",
    "the main results are summarized in figs .  9 and 12 .",
    "the @xmath9 oscillation probability has been studied as a function of the mass and mixing parameters ( figs .  7 and 8) . in the allowed regions at large @xmath5 ,",
    "the three - flavor probability varies more slowly with energy than in the two - generation case .",
    "thus , it will be difficult to study the large-@xmath5 solutions in the future solar neutrino experiments that are meant to probe the energy dependence of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "it has been shown that the solar neutrino results are linked to those obtained in an analysis of accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation searches @xcite , where the mass - mixing space @xmath48 has been thoroughly explored ( fig .",
    "this link can be used to further constrain the allowed ranges of the parameters .",
    "in particular , for @xmath147 ev@xmath24 , the angle @xmath5 is constrained to relatively small values . the threefold maximal mixing scenario @xcite is disfavored by solar neutrino data ( in the whole explored range of @xmath0 ) as well as by accelerator and reactor experiments for @xmath140 .",
    "the present study and the work in @xcite represent a detailed and accurate analysis of solar , accelerator , and reactor neutrino oscillations in three - flavors .",
    "the analysis has made it possible to obtain significant bounds in the mass - mixing parameter space @xmath141 .",
    "when this work was completed , we become aware of a recent three - flavor analysis of solar neutrino data performed by narayan _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "we agree only qualitatively on their results about the msw solutions .",
    "we do not agree on the precise shape of the allowed regions , and do not confirm their claim that the solutions are dramatically enlarged when the confidence level is moderately increased ( from @xmath151 to @xmath152 in their work ) .",
    "the information contained in @xcite is not detailed enough to trace the differences .",
    "we are grateful to j.  n.  bahcall , p.  i.  krastev , and s.  t.  petcov for useful discussions and suggestions .",
