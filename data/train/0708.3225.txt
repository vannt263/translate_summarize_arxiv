    "the effects of random point pining on the properties of vortex matter in high - temperature superconductors have been extensively investigated @xcite in a large number of experimental , theoretical , and numerical studies .",
    "however , many questions about the phase diagram of this system remain controversial . the existence of a topologically ordered bragg glass ( brg ) phase  @xcite with long - range bond - orientational order and power - law decay of translational correlations at low temperatures and low fields in systems with weak",
    "pinning has been experimentally established  @xcite .",
    "the brg phase melts into a disordered vortex liquid ( vl ) as the temperature is increased .",
    "it also becomes unstable as the pinning strength is increased ( or equivalently , the magnetic field is increased for a fixed amount of pinning ) with the temperature held fixed at a low value .",
    "there is no consensus at present about the nature of the phase into which the brg transforms under these conditions .",
    "the theoretical proposal  @xcite of the existence of a vortex glass ( vg ) with long - range coherence of the superconducting phase and divergent barriers for the motion of vortex lines in the limit of zero current has received support from many experiments  @xcite . however , other experimental studies@xcite have questioned the the existence of a vg phase thermodynamically distinct from the high - temperature vl .",
    "different numerical studies  @xcite have also reached different conclusions about the existence of the vg phase .",
    "the possible existence of other disordered phases , distinct from the vl and vg phases mentioned above , has also been suggested in several studies .",
    "one of these phases is the `` vortex slush '' ( vs )  a disordered , liquid - like phase with no superconducting phase coherence that is distinguished from the vl in that the translational correlation length in this phase is substantially larger than that in the vl .",
    "the existence of this phase in superconductors with random point pinning has been predicted theoretically  @xcite and several experimental studies  @xcite have presented evidence for the occurrence of a first - order transition between vl and vs phases ( followed by a continuous transition from the vs to the vg phase ) as the temperature is decreased at fixed magnetic field . a numerical study  @xcite has also provided evidence for the existence of the vs phase , although the validity of this evidence for macroscopic systems has been questioned in later work  @xcite .",
    "another glassy phase proposed to exist in both high - temperature and conventional superconductors with random point pinning is the `` multidomain glass '' ( mg )  @xcite in which the vortices are supposed to form crystalline domains with typical size substantially larger than the translational correlation length in the vl phase . in this mg phase , the vortex positions do not exhibit any long - range translational or orientational order and there is no superconducting phase coherence .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that a variety of interesting `` glassy '' behavior observed  @xcite near the melting transition of the brg phase may be explained by assuming that a small sliver of mg phase exists between the brg and vl phases , so that the brg first transforms to the mg phase as the temperature is increased , and then the mg melts into the vl at a slightly higher temperature .",
    "results of recent muon - spin - rotation experiments  @xcite have been interpreted as evidence for the occurrence of vortex structures similar to that expected in the mg phase in the disordered glassy phase of a high - temperature superconductor .",
    "there is an additional controversy about the structure of the disordered vortex state at low temperatures and strong pinning ( or high magnetic field ) .",
    "early decoration experiments  @xcite on layered high - temperature superconductors showed evidence for an amorphous arrangement of vortices in the disordered phase .",
    "however , more recent experiments  @xcite on a low - temperature superconductor , @xmath2 , have shown the occurrence of polycrystalline disordered structures . a similar disagreement exists between the results of different simulations : while a simulation  @xcite of the structure of a two - dimensional vortex system with random point pinning shows a polycrystalline arrangement of the vortices , another numerical study of a similar system  @xcite has found amorphous structures without well - defined crystalline regions separated by grain boundaries .",
    "the reason for this disagreement remains to be understood .",
    "the question we wish to address in this work is whether the differences ( summarized above ) among the results of different studies of the properties of vortex matter with random point pinning arise , at least in part , from differences in the details of the pinning potential .",
    "it is often quite difficult to obtain reliable information about the microscopic pinning centers present in an experimentally studied sample .",
    "therefore , it is possible that samples of the same superconductor studied in different experiments have different pinning potentials .",
    "this may account for some of the differences in the experimental results .",
    "similarly , the pinning potentials used in different simulations are often quite different from one another .",
    "it is , therefore , important to determine the extent to which the details of the pinning potential are relevant in determining the properties of the system .",
    "here we tackle this issue by studying the thermodynamic and structural properties of the mixed phase of a highly anisotropic layered high - temperature superconductor in the presence of a _ small _ concentration of randomly located _",
    "point pinning centers .",
    "the pinning centers on different layers are assumed to be completely uncorrelated .",
    "the primary motivation for this study is to examine the dependence of the phase diagram of this system and the structure of the disordered phase on the details of the random pinning potential by comparing the results obtained with previous results@xcite obtained from using the same methods for the same system , but with a much larger concentration of weaker point defects .    in theoretical studies , the random pinning potential @xmath3",
    "is usually assumed to be a random gaussian variable with zero mean , whose statistics is completely specified by the second moment of its distribution , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a short - ranged function ( its range is usually assumed to be of the order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath6 ) normalized to unity at @xmath7 , and the parameter @xmath8 measures the strength of pinning . for pinning due to a collection of randomly distributed point pinning centers , @xmath8 is proportional to the product of the depth @xmath1 of the pinning potential of an individual pinning center and the square root of the concentration @xmath9 of pinning centers . thus , two systems , one with small @xmath1 and large @xmath9 ( i.e. a large concentration of weak pinning centers ) and a second one with large @xmath1 , but small @xmath9 ( i.e. a small concentration of strong pinning centers ) may have very similar values of the parameter @xmath8 , so that an analytical treatment based on the assumption of gaussian randomness would predict the same behavior for the two systems . physically , however , it is not al all obvious that the properties of these two systems would be very similar .",
    "the main objective of our study is to examine this question .",
    "our study proceeds by numerical minimization of a discretized version of the ramakrishnan - yussouff ( ry )  @xcite free - energy functional for the system of pancake vortices in a highly anisotropic layered high - temperature superconductor , in a magnetic field normal to the layers .",
    "different phases of the system correspond to different local minima of the free energy in this mean - field description , and a crossing of the free energies of two different minima represents a first - order phase transition .",
    "information about the structure of different phases is obtained from various correlation functions of the density distributions at the corresponding free - energy minima .",
    "we have previously used this method to study the thermodynamic and structural properties of this system in the presence of a small concentration of strong columnar pinning centers perpendicular to the layers  @xcite , and also a large concentration of randomly placed weak point pinning centers  @xcite .",
    "we found the phase diagrams in the two cases to be quite different . in the system with a small concentration of strong columnar pins ,",
    "the low - temperature brg phase exhibited a two - step melting , via an intermediate polycrystalline bose glass phase , to the vl .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the prediction  @xcite of two - step melting ( via an intermediate mg phase ) of the brg phase in systems with random point pinning .",
    "in contrast , we found a single first - order melting of the brg phase in the system with a large concentration of weak random point pinning centers .",
    "the structure of the disordered phase was amorphous in this case .",
    "the pinning potentials in these two cases differ in two important ways .",
    "first , the pinning potential on different layers are perfectly correlated for columnar pins and completely uncorrelated for point pinning .",
    "second , the system with columnar pins has a small concentration of strong pining centers , whereas the one with point pinning has a large concentration of weak pinning centers .",
    "it is not clear which one of these two differences is the primary reason for the observed differences in the properties of these two systems .",
    "more important is the possibility that , in the case of point pinning alone , differences in the concentration and strength of the pinning centers can account for the apparently conflicting behaviors discussed above . to shed light on these issues ,",
    "we consider here a system with a small concentration of strong pinning centers whose positions on different layers are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the values of the areal concentration @xmath9 of pinning centers on each layer and the strength @xmath1 of the pinning potential of each pinning center are chosen so as to include the region where the values of the parameter @xmath10 are similar to those for the system with large @xmath9 and small @xmath1 studied earlier  @xcite .",
    "thus , a comparison of the results obtained here with those of ref .   can provide useful information about the dependence of the properties of disordered vortex matter on the details of the random pinning potential .",
    "the model of pinning considered here may be appropriate for films of high - temperature superconductors in which meandering lines of dislocations  @xcite or artificially introduced material defects  @xcite act as strong columnar pinning centers that are not perfectly correlated across layers .",
    "we consider a fixed value of the magnetic induction @xmath11 = 2 kg and study the phase behavior for different values of the strength @xmath1 of the pinning potential , keeping the low pin concentration @xmath9 fixed ( a discussion of how the behavior is expected to depend on the value of @xmath11 may be found in ref . ) .",
    "for relatively small values of @xmath1 , we find a topologically ordered brg phase at low temperatures , which melts into a vl via a first - order transition as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased , the temperature at which this melting transition occurs decreases , and the transition line in the @xmath12 plane tends to become parallel to the @xmath0-axis for large @xmath1 , indicating that the brg phase does not exist if the pin strength exceeds a critical value .",
    "we find that the disordered phase into which the brg transforms as @xmath1 is increased at low @xmath0 is glass - like : the vortices are strongly localized at points that do not form a structure with long - range translational or orientational correlation .",
    "however , this phase transforms continuously into the high - temperature vl as @xmath0 is increased at constant @xmath1 : we do not find any evidence for a phase transition between this glassy state and the vl .    although the general features of the phase diagram are qualitatively similar to those found in our earlier study ,  @xcite several other features found here are substantially different .",
    "the structure of the glassy state at large @xmath1 and low @xmath0 is quite different from that of the disordered phase found in ref .  .",
    "in the glassy phase of the present system , the vortices on each layer form a polycrystalline structure with crystalline domains separated by grain boundaries , in contrast to the amorphous structure found in ref .  . also , the vortex positions on different layers are now significantly correlated , with a correlation length of the order of 20 layer spacings .",
    "this is very different from the previously found@xcite glassy state , which does not exhibit any interlayer correlation in the vortex positions .",
    "the glassy state found here has the characteristics of the vs and mg phases mentioned above .",
    "for this reason , we classify this state as a vs , whereas the glassy state found in ref .",
    "was identified as a pinned vortex liquid .",
    "another difference in the properties of these two systems lies in the location of a crossover line that separates the region in the @xmath12 plane in which the vs is `` glassy '' in the sense that the peak vortex densities are high from that in which these densities are more liquid - like .",
    "this crossover line is obtained using a criterion  @xcite based on percolation of liquid - like regions .",
    "the location of this crossover line in relation to the first order line in the @xmath12 plane bounding the brg phase is quite different in the two systems .",
    "we also find that the rms value of the random pinning potential at which the brg melts in the present system is about an order of magnitude smaller than that at which the brg to pinned vortex liquid transition occurs in the system of ref .   at the same temperature .",
    "these differences illustrate the importance of the details of the pinning potential in determining the properties of disordered vortex matter , and suggest that the predictions of analytic calculations in which the effects of random pinning are assumed to be described completely by the second moment of the distribution of the pinning potential may not be quantitatively correct .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model considered here and the method of calculation are described in section  [ methods ] . in section  [ results ] , we describe in detail the results of our calculations and compare these results with those obtained in ref .. section  [ summary ] contains a summary of our main results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the system of pancake vortices in a highly anisotropic layered superconductor with vanishingly small josephson coupling between layers in a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers . in this system ,",
    "the pancake vortices on different layers are coupled only via their electromagnetic interaction .",

    "we then have @xmath47 where @xmath1 is the pinning potential strength , which we will give in degrees @xmath8 , and @xmath48 the number of defect points associated with the @xmath49 computational site .",
    "we consider here relatively large values of @xmath50 and small values of @xmath9 ( see below ) . in that case",
    "the most frequent value of the integer @xmath48 is zero and it rarely exceeds unity . with these conventions",
    "the average of @xmath44 is zero while its fluctuations are @xmath51 . in most of our calculations ,",
    "the concentration @xmath9 of pinning defects was fixed at a value that corresponds to having @xmath52 pins per layer , but we have also checked that results for 32 and 64 pins per layer are qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar .",
    "the pin concentration of 24 per layer corresponds , in physical units , to having @xmath53 pinning defects for every hundred unit cells in the underlying _",
    "crystal lattice_. this is in contrast to the value used in ref .   which was one defect per hundred unit cells of the crystal lattice .",
    "thus the value of @xmath9 used here is about four orders of magnitude smaller .",

    "different phases , corresponding to different vortex density structures , are obtained by starting the minimization process with different initial conditions . for a new pin configuration",
    ", one can start either with uniform conditions ( all variables @xmath29 set to their average value ) or with `` crystal like '' initial conditions where the initial values of the @xmath29 variables are set by minimizing@xcite the pinning energy of the equilibrium crystal configuration in the absence of pinning .",
    "the first set of initial conditions leads to a disordered configuration provided that such a configuration exists , at the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 considered , as a local free energy minimum , that is , either a stable or a metastable configuration .",
    "similarly , the second set of initial conditions leads to an ordered state of the brg type , if such a state is at least metastable .",
    "once a local minimum configuration has been obtained at a certain @xmath1 and @xmath0 , it can be used as the initial condition for a run at nearby values of these parameters .",
    "this procedure is efficient since convergence is then fast unless in changing the parameter values the boundary of stability of the phase in question is crossed .",
    "we have used this method to carry out various annealing and thermal cycling procedures  @xcite that ensure that the free - energy minima considered in our studies represent low - lying local minima of the free energy .",
    "results for different random pin configurations at the same values of @xmath9 and @xmath1 are extremely consistent and we have found it sufficient to average over three different configurations in order to obtain quantities such as the location of phase boundaries .      , @xmath55 for 20 consecutive layers in the disordered phase ( top panel ) and at @xmath56 , @xmath57 for all 128 layers in the ordered phase ( lower panel ) .",

    "these two plots , therefore , suggest that the disordered minima obtained in the present study exhibit a much higher degree of short - range order than those found earlier for a system with a large concentration of weak pinning centers .     and a large concentration ( @xmath86 of the underlying crystal lattice ) of weak ( @xmath88 ) point defects , as in ref .  .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the same as in the top panel in fig  [ fig4 ] , with which the current plot should be compared .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    to make these observations more quantitative , we have calculated two correlation functions , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , that represent , respectively , the degree of correlation among the _ vortex positions _ ( i.e. the positions of the local peaks of the density field ) in the layer plane and across layers .",
    "the function @xmath91 is the usual angularly averaged pair - distribution function of vortex positions on the same layer , averaged over all the layers .",
    "it should not be confused with the correlation function @xmath93 considered in section  [ struc ] which represents the two - point correlation of the time - averaged _ local density _ : therefore , @xmath82 is sensitive to both the positions and the heights of the local density peaks , whereas @xmath91 provides more accurate information about the correlation in the peak positions because it is insensitive to the heights of the local density peaks .",
    "the function @xmath92 is defined as follows : for each peak position on a layer , we calculate the number of peaks on another layer , separated by @xmath15 layer spacings from the original one , that lie within a small in - plane distance @xmath94 from it .",
    "this number is then averaged over all the peak positions on all the layers and divided by @xmath95 , the average number of vortices in a circular area of radius @xmath94 , to obtain @xmath92 .",
    "the values of @xmath92 are found to be insensitive to the choice of @xmath94 as long as @xmath94 is small compared to the average distance between nearest - neighbor vortices ( @xmath96 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , top panel ) on the same layer .",
    "the results reported here were obtained using @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear from the definition of @xmath92 that this function measures the degree of alignment between vortices on two layers separated by @xmath15 layer spacings .",
    "if the vortex positions on different layers are completely uncorrelated , then @xmath92 should be equal to unity for all @xmath15 .",
    "values of @xmath98 indicate some degree of alignment between the vortex positions on different layers .",

    "the function @xmath91 for this low @xmath9 and high @xmath1 system exhibits six clear peaks of decreasing height , indicating the existence of in - plane positional correlations up to a distance of about @xmath103 .",
    "this length scale is consistent with the typical size ( 2030 vortices , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , top panel ) of in - plane crystalline domains at the disordered free - energy minima found in the present work .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath91 for the system with a large concentration of weak pinning centers exhibits no prominent peaks , indicating that the disordered phase of this system has very little in - plane positional order and crystalline domains can not be meaningfully defined in this case .    a similar difference in the degree of out - of - plane correlations in the vortex positions is also found in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    "where the function @xmath92 is plotted for the two free - energy minima of fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the data for the system with a large concentration of weak pinning centers are all close to 1.0 , even for values of @xmath15 near 1 .",

    "@xmath92 for the present system starts at a value close to 2.0 for @xmath15 near 1 , and approaches unity only as @xmath15 approaches about @xmath104 , ( the largest value of @xmath15 for which @xmath92 can be defined in our system of @xmath31 layers with periodic boundary conditions is @xmath105 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the vortices on different layers are aligned to some extent in the disordered phase of the present system .",
    "we find that the dependence of @xmath92 on the layer separation @xmath15 can be represented quite well by the functional form @xmath106 where the `` correlation length '' @xmath107 provides a measure of the degree of out - of - plane alignment of the vortices .",
    "a fit of the data to this functional form ( with @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "similar values of @xmath107 are found for other values of the parameters in the disordered phase of the present system , indicating that the vortex positions on different layers are substantially correlated in the system with a small concentration of strong pinning centers .",
    "it is clear from all the results described above that the disordered free - energy minima found in the present study exhibit a substantial degree of short - range positional order .",
    "the in - plane structure can be described as polycrystalline , with 20 - 30 vortices in each crystalline domain .",
    "the vortex positions on different layers are also correlated , with a correlation length of 15 - 20 layer spacings .",
    "these features are similar to those expected for the vs and mg phases that have been predicted to exist in vortex systems with random point pinning .",
    "we , therefore , identify the disordered phase in the present system as vs. this is qualitatively different from the disordered phase found in our earlier study  @xcite of a vortex system with a large concentration of weak pinning centers . in that case , the disordered phase , which does not exhibit any appreciable in - plane or out - of - plane correlation in the vortex positions , was identified as pinned vortex liquid which should be distinguished from the vs found in the present work .       as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity plotted is the free energy per vortex in units of @xmath110 .",
    "the ( red ) plus signs are results for the vs phase and the ( green ) @xmath111 signs for the brg phase .",
    "straight lines connect the data points .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    to determine the phase diagram one simply looks for free energy crossings as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is quite straightforward .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , where we consider the free energy per vortex , in units of @xmath110 , for the brg and vs phases at constant @xmath1 as a function of temperature . in the range plotted both phases are locally stable .",
    "the brg minimum becomes unstable just beyond the right edge of the plot .",
    "the symbols correspond to the results for the free energy and they are connected by straight lines .",
    "error bars from statistical averaging over different pin configurations are smaller than the symbols . the first order transition between the two phases",
    "is easily located from such data . a similar first order transition from the brg to the vs phase",
    "is found as the pinning strength @xmath1 is increased while keeping @xmath0 constant at a low value .",
    "the brg minimum becomes unstable as @xmath1 or @xmath0 is increased slightly above the value at which the transition to the vs phase occurs .",
    "the vs minimum , on the other hand , remains locally stable for all the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 considered here .",
    "for relatively small values of @xmath1 and large @xmath0 , the values of the density at the local peaks of the density field in the vs phase do not greatly exceed ( see below ) the average liquid density value @xmath21 except for peaks at the pinning centers . in that sense , the vs phase might be said to be liquid - like . on the other hand , for large @xmath1 and low @xmath0 , these local peak density values are substantially larger than @xmath21 , indicating strongly localized vortices .",
    "a vs minimum with these properties should be viewed as solid - like ( glass ) .",
    "however , for the parameter range explored here , we do not find any evidence for a transition within the vs state between the high @xmath0-low @xmath1 and the low @xmath0-high @xmath1 structures .",
    "a liquid - like minimum obtained by starting the free - energy minimization from disordered initial conditions at a high @xmath0 evolves continuously to a glassy vs minimum as it is `` followed '' to a low temperature by reducing @xmath0 in small steps and performing the free - energy minimization at each new temperature with the minimum obtained at the previous temperature as the initial state .",
    "similarly , a glassy vs minimum obtained at low @xmath0 and large @xmath1 by starting the minimization from disordered initial conditions ( or by starting from a brg minimum and increasing @xmath1 to a value at which the brg minimum becomes unstable and a disordered minimum is found ) evolves continuously to the high - temperature liquid - like structure as @xmath0 is increased in small steps .",
    "thus , our results do not show the first - order vl to vs transition found in some experiments  @xcite and in a simulation  @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments and simulation show that the line of first - order vl to vs transitions ends at a critical point as the pinning strength ( in the simulation ) or the magnetic field ( in the experiments ) is increased .",
    "it is likely that the parameters used in our study correspond to values beyond this critical point , so that no vl to vs transition is found . in a study  @xcite of the same vortex system in the presence of a small concentration of strong columnar pins ( with values of @xmath1 comparable to those used here ) perpendicular to the layers",
    ", we found a first - order transition from the high - temperature vl to a polycrystalline bose glass phase as @xmath0 was decreased , but only when the ratio of the number of pinning centers to the number of vortices per layer was less than about 1/32 .",
    "the value of this ratio in the present study ( 24/256 = 3/32 ) is larger than 1/32 .",
    "this suggests that a first - order vl to vs transition may occur in the present system for a smaller concentration of pinning centers .",
    "it is , however , difficult to test this possibility numerically .",
    "the typical size of crystalline domains in a vs state will increase as the concentration of pinning centers is reduced .",
    "a multi - domain structure can be distinguished from a crystalline one in a numerical study only if the sample size is substantially larger than the typical domain size .",
    "so , to study polycrystalline free - energy minima in the present system for a much smaller concentration of pinning centers , one would require samples containing a few thousand vortices per layer .",
    "samples of such size could be studied for columnar pins because the problem is then effectively two - dimensional , but a similar study for the present case ( where the problem is three - dimensional ) would be computationally intractable .     of liquid like sites .",
    "the ( red ) dots are the data , as explained in the text .",
    "the ( blue ) dashed line is along the value of 1/2 .",
    "[ fig10 ] ]    a crossover line between liquid - like and glassy behaviors of the vs phase can be drawn in the @xmath12 plane by using a criterion based on percolation . in ref .",
    ", we found that a local peak of the density field may be classified as `` liquid - like '' ( the corresponding vortex is weakly localized ) if @xmath112 , the value of the density variable at the peak , does not exceed @xmath113 .",
    "otherwise it is characterized as `` solid - like '' , representing a strongly localized vortex .",
    "one can then readily examine whether or not , at a certain @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the regions with @xmath114 percolate across any of the layers in a sample .",
    "if such regions percolate in a majority of the layers , then the corresponding vs minimum may be classified as `` liquid - like '' ; otherwise , the minimum should be called `` glassy '' .",
    "similar percolation criteria have been used in other studies  @xcite to differentiate between liquid and glassy phases .",
    "we have done this for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 studied .",
    "the probability that liquid - like sites percolate across a layer depends on the fraction @xmath115 of such sites .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where we see that the percolation probability is 1/2 very close to @xmath116 .",
    "we have therefore adopted the criterion that percolation of liquid - like regions occurs at @xmath116 , which is also the percolation threshold for random site percolation on a triangular lattice .",

    "we have also indicated in the panel the percolation line for high @xmath1 and low @xmath0  percolation of liquid - like regions in the vs phase occurs as this line is crossed from the left or from above .",
    "a few features of the phase diagram are worth pointing out .",
    "the temperature at which the melting transition of the brg phase occurs is quite insensitive to the value of @xmath1 for relatively small values of @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased further , the transition temperature decreases and the phase boundary tends to become parallel to the temperature axis for large @xmath1 .",
    "the decrease in the transition temperature with increasing @xmath1 is in qualitative agreement with the prediction of analytic calculations.@xcite the brg phase exists only if the pinning strength is sufficiently small .",
    "the shape of the brg  vs phase boundary in our phase diagram is similar to that found in the simulation of ref .",
    "in which the ratio of the number of pinning centers to the number of vortex lines is similar to the value used here .",
    "the location of the percolation line relative to the brg  vs phase boundary is also similar to that of the vs  vg transition line found in ref .  .",
    "this , however , may be a coincidence , since the percolation line in our phase diagram does not correspond to a true phase transition , whereas the vs ",
    "vg transition line in ref",
    ".   represents a phase transition signaled by the appearance of superconducting phase coherence which can not be studied in our calculation .    for comparison",
    "we have included in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( lower panel ) the phase diagram obtained@xcite for a high concentration of weak pinning centers , including also the percolation line , which was not reported earlier .",
    "the general shapes of the phase boundaries obtained in the two cases are similar .",
    "however , a quantitative comparison shows that a low concentration of strong pinning centers considered in the present study is much more effective in destroying the nearly crystalline order of the brg phase than a large concentration of weak pinning centers considered previously .",
    "for example , in the phase diagram shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the transition of the brg phase to the vs phase at @xmath117 occurs at @xmath118 , for which the rms pinning potential is @xmath119 ( see section  [ methods ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the transition at @xmath120 in the phase diagram in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] occurs near @xmath121 , for which the rms value of the pinning potential is @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the rms value of the random pinning potential at which the brg phase undergoes a transition to a disordered phase at a fixed temperature in a system with a large concentration of weak pinning centers is about _ 10 times larger _ than that in a system with a small concentration of strong pinning centers .",
    "this implies that the kind of pinning considered in the present study is much `` stronger '' ( i.e. more effective in destroying brg order ) than that considered in ref .  .",
    "the comparison between the two phase diagrams also points out a serious flaw in analytic calculations in which the random pinning potential is assumed to be gaussian and its effects are assumed to be determined completely by its rms value ( second moment ) .",
    "our results show that the details of the pinning potential , not just its second moment , are very important in determining the phase behavior : the value of the second moment of the pinning potential at which the brg phase undergoes a transition to a disordered phase at a fixed temperature can vary by orders of magnitude , depending on the details of the pinning potential .",
    "thus , the predictions of analytic calculations  @xcite of the phase diagram of superconductors with random pinning , in which the effects of the pinning potential are assumed to be determined by its second moment only , can not be quantitatively accurate  the details of the pinning potential have to be taken into account for an accurate theoretical determination of the locations of the phase boundaries .",
    "[ fig11 ] also shows that the location of the percolation line relative to that of the transition line of the brg phase is very different in the two cases . in the top panel",
    ", the percolation line intersects the brg  vs transition line at a relatively low temperature where the latter is almost parallel to the @xmath0-axis , whereas in the bottom panel , the intersection is near the high - temperature , `` vertical '' part of the boundary of the brg phase . the value of the dimensionless quantity @xmath123 , which measures the ratio of the rms value of the pinning potential to the thermal energy is , along the percolation line , nearly the same in the two cases , indicating that the rms value of the pinning potential provides a fairly accurate account of the effectiveness of random pinning in localizing the vortices .",
    "the difference in the location of the percolation line relative to the phase boundary of the brg phase again arises because the rms value of the pinning potential is _ not _ , by itself , a good indicator of the effectiveness of the pinning potential in destroying brg order .",
    "we have considered here a layered superconductor with a small concentration @xmath9 of strong random point pinning centers and a fixed magnetic induction , normal to the layers .",
    "we have described the phase diagram in the @xmath12 plane , where @xmath1 is the pinning strength .",
    "we find that the stable phase at sufficiently low values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is clearly a bragg glass ( brg ) , as in the high @xmath9 case.@xcite the melting line in the @xmath12 plane at low @xmath0 is nearly horizontal . upon increasing @xmath1 or @xmath0",
    "the brg melts via a first order transition into a disordered phase .",
    "we find that this phase is clearly polycrystalline ( see top panels in figs  [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] ) with well defined crystalline domains separated by domain walls .",
    "it has characteristics of the vs phase discussed in the literature,@xcite and of the also proposed@xcite mg phase .",
    "we therefore characterize this phase ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] and the text ) as a vs. there is a very clear difference between this and the high @xmath9 , low @xmath1 case as to the nature of this disordered phase . for large @xmath9 and low @xmath1 ,",
    "this phase was found@xcite to be an amorphous , pinned vl state , with almost no correlations in the layer plane or between different layers ( see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "a key result of this paper is this contrast between the behavior of the system studied here and that of the corresponding system@xcite with a much larger concentration of weak pinning centers .",
    "the phase diagrams of these two systems in the @xmath12 plane are qualitatively similar , but very different quantitatively .",
    "the value of the second moment of the random pinning potential at which the transition of the brg to the vs occurs in the present system is much smaller than that at the brg to pinned vl transition in ref .   at the same temperature .",
    "also , the location of the percolation line relative to the phase boundary of the brg phase is quite different in the two systems .",
    "these results imply that the notion that the parameter @xmath87 suffices to characterize the effects of the random point pinning potential ( in other words , that it is enough to specify its second moment ) is too simplistic and may be quantitatively inaccurate .",
    "the assumption of gaussian randomness , which implies that only the value of the second moment of the distribution of the random pinning potential is relevant , is valid only in a rather limited sense , namely only when the pinning potential seen by a vortex is the sum of contributions from a large number of weak pinning centers .",
    "the validity of the gaussian assumption does not extend further than that , as we have proved here .",
    "although the limited validity of this assumption was mentioned in a few existing studies,@xcite which did not however quantify its degree of inadequacy , it has been generally ignored .",
    "our results suggest that many of the experimental and theoretical controversies found in the literature ( which we have reviewed in our introduction ) about the behavior of this system originate in differences in the insufficiently characterized nature of the point pinning .",
    "this conclusion , besides its obvious theoretical import , has also strong practical implications since a good understanding of the effects of pinning is the key to obtaining the larger values of the critical current that are needed for the high temperature superconductors to fulfill their promise as potentially useful materials .",
