    "<S> path entanglement constitutes an essential resource in quantum information and communication protocols . here , </S>",

    "<S> we detect and quantify the path entanglement contained in the beam splitter output state . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments open the avenue to quantum teleportation , quantum communication , or quantum radar with continuous variables at microwave frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> fascinatingly , quantum mechanics allows for a compound system to have a common description while , at the same time , no individual states can be ascribed to its subsystems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of entanglement between spatially separated systems is a necessary condition for what einstein called `` spooky action at a distance ''  @xcite : the contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , entanglement is at the heart of quantum communication and information processing technologies , which promise significant performance gains over classical protocols  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , entanglement has been extensively explored in atomic physics and quantum optics  @xcite . in these investigations </S>",
    "<S> , optical frequencies were preferred over microwaves because the higher photon energies facilitate practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the late 1990s , microwave technology has evolved rapidly in both industry and science . </S>",
    "<S> for one thing , classical microwave fields have become an indispensable tool in mobile communication . for another , a promising direction towards scalable quantum information processing has appeared with the advent of superconducting microwave quantum circuits  @xcite . despite some decoherence issues , these systems provide unprecedented light - matter coupling strengths due to their large effective dipole moments and field enhancement effects  @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> standing - wave fields in transmission line resonators were shown to act as a short - range quantum bus between superconducting qubits  @xcite and various gates were implemented  @xcite . for microwave quantum communication , however , propagating fields are required . as a first step in this direction </S>",
    "<S> , early experiments demonstrated tomography of weak thermal states  @xcite , coherent states  @xcite , and single photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , continuous - variable states generated by josephson parametric devices were reconstructed  @xcite . very recently , such devices have permitted to investigate two - mode squeezing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of these experiments is the understanding they provide regarding entanglement . in order to be a resource in quantum communication protocols </S>",
    "<S> , it must occur between spatially separated subsystems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a strict proof of entanglement requires the entangler and the detector to be based on independent experimental techniques .        in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we make a significant step beyond previous efforts and demonstrate path entanglement in the microwave regime , respecting both criteria mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments follow the spirit of the quantum - optical realization  @xcite of the original einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig1 ] , we combine a vacuum and a squeezed vacuum state in a hybrid ring microwave beam splitter  @xcite acting as an entangling device . </S>",
    "<S> its two output ports hold a continuous - variable state which is frequency - degenerate and entangled with respect to the two propagation paths . along these paths , </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement can be conveniently distributed to two parties requiring it for any suitable quantum communication protocol . in our experiments , we first reconstruct the squeezed _ input _ state by means of dual - path tomography  @xcite , which assumes knowledge of the beam splitter relations . </S>",
    "<S> next , we reconstruct the moments of the _ output _ state after the beam splitter by treating the latter as a black box and calibrating against a known state  @xcite . in this reference - state method </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary ) , we only assume that independent vacuum states are produced in each output path when vacuum is incident at both input ports . from the moments reconstructed in this way , we build a witness matrix which proves the existence of path entanglement independently of the detailed nature of our output state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since in practice the data shows that our states are gaussian , we finally quantify the degree of entanglement by means of the negativity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this analysis agrees with what we expect for our squeezed input state . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that for bipartite single - mode gaussian entanglement , as it is relevant in our case , entanglement implies nonlocality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all in all , our results show that we have realized the main building block for microwave quantum teleportation and communication protocols .    </S>",
    "<S> the generation of the input states for the beam splitter is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum is realized with a commercial 50-termination at 40mk acting as a broadband black - body emitter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezed state is produced using a particular superconducting circuit , the flux - driven josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa )  @xcite . in this device </S>",
    "<S> two josephson junctions form a nonlinearity which can be modulated ( `` pumped '' ) at gigahertz frequencies to achieve a parametric effect . the jpa box is stabilized to @xmath0mk . a thermal state emitted by an attenuator </S>",
    "<S> , whose temperature can be varied from @xmath1mk , can be fed into the jpa . </S>",
    "<S> our cross correlation detector is based on the insight that for microwave signals off - the - shelf high- gain low - noise linear amplifiers are available rather than efficient single photon counters . </S>",
    "<S> we connect one amplification path to each output port of the beam splitter . at room temperature </S>",
    "<S> we record the in - phase and quadrature components , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the amplified signals . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged moments @xmath4 are computed for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in real time using a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) logic . </S>",
    "<S> further details can be found in the supplementary .        as a first test of our setup , we perform dual - path reconstructions of the wigner function for known input states . here , we exploit the fact that the noise contributions of the two amplification paths are independent , while the split signals are correlated  @xcite(see supplementary ) . we reconstruct vacuum fluctuations and coherent states ( displaced vacuum ) , both at a frequency @xmath7ghz . because of narrow - band filtering , we approximate the vacuum and thermal states as single - mode fields . the results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig2](a ) exhibit a very good phase control for the coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a small thermal contribution of @xmath8  photons above the vacuum level which can be due to a small thermal population or other experimental imperfections . in the next step , </S>",
    "<S> we generate a squeezed state by pumping the jpa . for a signal gain of @xmath9db and a phase of @xmath10 , the reconstructed wigner function </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the reconstructed signal moments reveals that , at the input of the beam splitter , the state generated by the jpa is squeezed by @xmath11db below the vacuum level and contains @xmath12  photons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the product of the standard deviation of the squeezed quadrature with that of its orthogonal , enlarged one , is @xmath13  times larger than the variance of the ideal vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we can model the state as one created by an ideal squeezer acting on an effective thermal field with @xmath14  photons . </S>",
    "<S> this thermal field contains the combined effects of losses and the small thermal population found in the experimental vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> again , we notice good control of the phase . it is noteworthy to mention that the amount of squeezing quoted above is mainly limited by cable losses and not by the jpa itself .    after characterizing the input fields of the beam splitter </S>",
    "<S> , we now turn to its outputs . with the reference - state method </S>",
    "<S> , we build an entanglement witness matrix from the reconstructed moments . </S>",
    "<S> our witness reliably distinguishes between `` separable outputs '' for the vacuum state and `` path entangled outputs '' for the squeezed state input . </S>",
    "<S> next , we analyze the third and fourth order cumulants and find them to be small for jpa signal gains up to @xmath9db . since this is a strong indication for gaussian states , we explore the path entanglement generated in our setup quantitatively via the negativity @xmath15 . for positive values </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 describes the degree of entanglement produced between the beam splitter output paths ( see supplementary ) . in the limit of low jpa signal gain , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig3](a ) shows how @xmath15 becomes suppressed when sending more and more thermal photons into the jpa . </S>",
    "<S> at some point , the jpa can not squeeze the incoming field below the vacuum anymore and the output state is no longer entangled . for constant temperature , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig3](b ) shows how @xmath15 increases with increasing signal gain from zero to a value @xmath16 at @xmath9db signal gain . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in good agreement with the negativity @xmath17 calculated from the dual - path reconstructed input state . </S>",
    "<S> again , we observe a suppression for large thermal fields sent into the jpa . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the expectation  @xcite that the degree of squeezing at the beam splitter input determines the amount of entanglement generated between the output paths . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath18 is generally slightly lower than @xmath15 , we conclude that either the dual - path reconstruction underestimates the squeezing at the beam splitter input or the reference - state method ignores a small amount of spurious classical correlations between the two paths . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are consistent with the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ path_ent_fig3](a ) , where at constant signal gain , the curve measured with the reference - state method at the beam splitter output converges for high temperatures to that calculated from the dual - path reconstructed input state . </S>",
    "<S> we finally note that the path - entangled state is expected to be a two - mode squeezed state with two additional local squeezing operations applied to it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since local operations do not change the amount of entanglement , the negativity @xmath16 implies that the two - mode squeezed state before the two local operations would have a variance squeezed by @xmath19db below that of the two - mode vacuum .        in summary , we present clear evidence for path entanglement generated by combining two frequency - degenerate continuous - variable microwave fields , the vacuum and the squeezed vacuum , in a beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> for an input state squeezed @xmath11db below the vacuum , we observe a maximum negativity @xmath20 at @xmath9db jpa signal gain . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments bring the exciting quantum physics of entangled propagating electromagnetic fields to the technologically highly attractive microwave domain . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , they open up new and exciting perspectives towards microwave quantum teleportation , quantum communication , and quantum radar  @xcite .    the authors thank christopher eichler for discussions . </S>",
