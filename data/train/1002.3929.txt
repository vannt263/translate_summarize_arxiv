    "spintronics exploits the fact that an electron current consists of spinful carriers , with information stored in their spin state , which interact in a controlled way with their magnetic environment .",
    "research in this field was pioneered in the 70s with the experiments of tedrow and meservey  @xcite on ferromagnet / superconductor tunnel junctions as well as the experiments of jullire  @xcite on magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "it fully emerged in the 80s with the observation of spin - polarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal  @xcite followed by the discovery of the well known giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect  @xcite .",
    "since then , most of the studies focused on stationary magnetic states and the control of the electrical current by tuning the state of the magnet as in , e.g. gmr , see ref .  [ ] for a review . the study of the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnet ( f)/normal metal ( n ) as well as f / superconductor ( s ) hybrids is much more recent and",
    "basically involves controlling the state of the magnet with the help of an applied electrical current .",
    "the main trigger was the experimental confirmation of the ideas of slonczewski  @xcite and berger  @xcite that an electrical current may affect the state of the magnet via a spin transfer torque , see ref .",
    "[ ] for a pedagogical introduction .",
    "indeed , a spin - polarized current of high enough density injected into a ferromagnet was shown to reverse the magnetization or generate a steady - state precessing magnetization in accordance with theoretical predictions .",
    "many recent experiments have confirmed these facts , see ref .",
    "[ ] for a review .",
    "conversely , a microwave driven precessing magnetization of a ferromagnetic layer under ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) was shown to emit pure spin currents , i.e. without any associated net charge transfer , into the adjacent normal metal layers , see refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] for the theory .",
    "such a spin current was only indirectly measured as an enhancement of the gilbert damping of the magnetization dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , a similar experiment has been performed on s / f hybrids  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of n / f hybrids , it was shown that the gilbert damping is reduced at temperatures well below the superconducting transition temperature , see ref .",
    "[ ] for the theory .    at the same time , there is a fast growing interest in controlling the spin orientation of single molecules or even a single or a few atoms in order to perform basic quantum operations .",
    "recently , the control of the spin orientation of a single manganese atom in a semiconductor quantum dot could be achieved with the help of optical techniques  @xcite . at the molecular level ,",
    "the experimental challenge is already at the level of designing a molecular junction .",
    "single - molecule magnets ( smm ) were recently contacted to metallic leads allowing electron - transport measurement through them  @xcite to probe their properties , see refs .  [ ] for recent reviews on smms .",
    "the access resistance due to the normal - contacts may however be a source of limitation which motivated the design of superconducting molecular junctions .",
    "this was first done with semiconducting nanowires  @xcite , carbon - nanotubes  @xcite and more recently with a single c@xmath4 fullerene molecule  @xcite .",
    "magnetically active metallofullerene molecules could also be contacted to superconducting leads and the proximity - induced superconductivity was studied via low - temperature transport measurements  @xcite . on the theoretical side , equilibrium properties of such josephson junctions were extensively studied since a long time , see refs .",
    "[ ] without being extensive ; the effect of magnetization dynamics has been discussed more recently , see e.g.  [ ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for completeness , a similar plot for a @xmath5junction is shown on figs .",
    "[ fig : scgps_0j ] . in these figures",
    "@xmath6 but @xmath7 in figs .",
    "[ fig : scgps_0j]a and [ fig : scgps_0j]b , whereas @xmath8 in figs .",
    "[ fig : scgps_0j]c and [ fig : scgps_0j]d .",
    "provided that tunneling across the impurity still takes place , i.e. @xmath9 , these figures show the same tendency as figs .",
    "[ fig : scgps_pij ] for the damping to be strongly suppressed below @xmath10 in favor of a shift of the precession frequency due to the superconducting spin - current .",
    "the magnitudes of the constants are however reduced by an order of magnitude upon reducing @xmath11 .",
    "for a junction of arbitrary transparency , we therefore arrive at the conclusion that , deep in the superconducting phase , the precession of the spin is maintained though the frequency may be slightly lowered , in the adiabatic regime , by the condensate spin - current .",
    "other non - dissipative effects , such as a nutation  @xcite of the localized spin due to the singlet - nature of the current carriers , may then affect the motion of the molecular precessing spin but they will not suppress the magnetization dynamics .",
    "in conclusion we have presented a theory of charge and spin transport in a s / smm / s junction where the single - molecule magnet is precessing at the frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the theory is based on a usual green s function approach combined with a unitary transformation which replaces the time - dependent problem by a static one with non - colinear magnetization . starting from the tunnel limit at zero temperature ,",
    "both analytical and numerical results were presented , in a complementary way , for a junction of arbitrary transparency and at finite temperatures .",
    "our goals were to study the out - of - equilibrium effects of the magnetization dynamics on the current flowing through the junction as well as the back - action of this current on the magnetization dynamics .",
    "for a phase biased junction , the unitary transformation to the rotating frame has revealed that a steady - state superconducting charge current flows through the junction and that an out - of - equilibrium circularly polarized spin current , of frequency @xmath0 , is emitted in the leads .",
    "these currents and the corresponding current - phase relations ( cpr ) were then derived and the nature of the current carrying states was discussed .",
    "we have shown that the dynamics of the molecular spin in the junction affects both the spectrum of the andreev states and their occupation . at high precession frequencies",
    ", it eventually leads to their disappearance as current - carrying states in favor of extended ( quasi - particle like ) states . at low precession frequencies ,",
    "in particular in the experimentally reachable adiabatic limit where @xmath12 , and for high transparencies of the junction , the abrupt change in the occupation of the andreev states is seen as sharp steps in the cprs with significant variations of the current . when the transmission amplitude through the magnetic impurity dominates the direct transmission amplitude ( @xmath13 ) and the junction is in a @xmath14state , the cprs ( both for charge and spin currents ) show that the current is strongly suppressed around @xmath3 and @xmath15 . in the opposite case of a @xmath5junction , still with a non - zero transmission amplitude through the magnetic channel ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "a similar suppression takes place around @xmath17 , though the magnitude of the effect is much smaller . integrating this contact into a superconducting loop",
    "one may hope that such sharp features could be observed experimentally .",
    "in particular , our results for the charge cpr of a @xmath14junction with a high transmission amplitude in the magnetic channel bear some similarity to experimental results on microwave irradiated sns @xmath5junctions .",
    "the cpr was recently measured  @xcite in such a setup and the current was shown to be strongly suppressed near @xmath17 upon increasing the rf power .",
    "we have also shown that the spin current has a weak back - action on the dynamics of the magnetization deep in the superconducting phase , i.e. at temperatures lower than the critical superconducting temperature by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the reason is the strong suppression of quasi - particles well below @xmath18 and in the adiabatic regime where @xmath12 .",
    "this agrees with recent experiments on s / f hybrids  @xcite under fmr where the gilbert damping was shown to be much reduced contrary to the case of n / f hybrids  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the strong suppression of the damping , at low@xmath19 , goes along with a shift of the precession frequency due to the back - action of the remaining superconducting part of the spin - current on the molecular magnet .",
    "the fact that the dynamics of the magnetization is only weakly affected by the back - action of the current provides a self - consistent check for the validity of the above results concerning the cpr .",
