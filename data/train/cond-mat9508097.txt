    "the liquid alkali metals have been studied extensively in both experimental and theoretical sides . they can be easily used to test a theoretical approach as the first step , since they constitute  simple \" metals and  simple \" liquids : furthermore , there exist many reliable experimental results to be compared . in the standard theory ,",
    "a liquid metal is treated as a one - component liquid interacting via a binary effective potential , which is determined by the pseudopotential formalism ; a pseudopotential is introduced either by first - principles calculations or by adjusting parameters involved in model potentials to some experimental results . in this treatment ,",
    "the ionic structures are determined independently of the electronic structures in a liquid metal .",
    "it is only recent that a liquid metal is thought of as an electron - ion mixture and the ionic structures are determined in a coupled manner with the electronic structures .",
    "one of such approaches is the car - parrinello molecular - dynamics ( cp - md ) technique@xcite , where a liquid metal is taken as a binary mixture of ions and electrons . in the cp - md method ,",
    "the electron - ion interaction is described by a pseudopotential to produce pseudo - wavefunctions which can be accurately represented by small number of plain waves .",
    "the cp - md method possesses advantage to avoid the difficult task of constructing an effective ion - ion potential required to perform the molecular - dynamics simulation , and afford to provide _ ab initio _ calculations of metallic systems in principle .",
    "however , the most serious problem in this approach is that the number of particles used in the simulations can not be taken large a nd a total of time steps performed in the simulations is limited to a small size within the present computational resources . in the present work ,",
    "we propose another scheme of _ first principles _ molecular - dynamics simulation based on the density - functional ( df ) method applied to the ion - electron mixture ; this simulation method can be performed on the large number of particles to last a large size of time steps , since this scheme reduces the electron - i on problem to a usual classical md coupled with a set of integral equations determining an effective ion - ion interaction : a problem to determine the ion - configuration structure and the ion - ion interaction in a self - consistent manner .",
    "previously , we have proposed a set of integral equations for radial distribution functions ( rdf s ) in an electron - ion mixture on the basis of the df theory in the quantal hyper - netted ( qhnc ) approximation@xcite . in this qhnc formalism , the bare electron - ion interaction @xmath0 and the ionic charge @xmath1 are determined self - consistently by regarding a liquid metal as a mixture of nuclei and electrons@xcite .",
    "already , we have applied this approach to liquid metallic hydrogen@xcite , lithium@xcite , sodium@xcite , potassium@xcite and aluminum@xcite obtaining ion - ion structure factors in excellent agreements with experiments .",
    "the qhnc equations are derived from exact expressions for the electron - ion and ion - ion rdf s in an electron - ion mixture : these exact expressions are only formal results derived from the df theory .",
    "a molecular - dynamics scheme to treat an ion - electron mixture can be set up on the basis of these exact relations , which states that the electron - ion mixture can be regarded as a quasi - one component liquid interacting via a @xmath2 interaction in the description of the ion - ion rdf@xcite ( hereafter , referred to as the qhnc - md method ) .",
    "since the qhnc formalism is derived on the electron - ion model where the bound - electrons forming an ion in a liquid metal is assumed to be clearly distinguished from the conduction electrons and the overlap of the core electrons is negligible , the qhnc - md method is only applicable to simple liquid metals : its application to liquid alkali metals is taken as an ideal test of the qhnc - md method .",
    "thus , the qhnc - md method has been shown to yield structure factors of liquid alkali metals in excellent agreement with experiments as the result of a first - principles calculation in the present work .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hnc ] , we sketch the qhnc formulation : exact expressions for rdf s in an electron - ion mixture are obtained from the df method@xcite , and the nucleus - electron model is shown to provide a bare electron - ion interaction , which should be determined self - consistently .",
    "the procedure to perform the md simulation based on the qhnc theory is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : md ] : in the qhnc formulation the effective ion - ion interaction used in the md simulation depends on the ionic structure specified by the ion - ion rdf .",
    "therefore , in the application of this md scheme it is important to extrapolate the md rdf beyond the truncation radius of the simulation correctly so as to be used in the determination of effective ion - ion interaction ; this is exemplified by the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : md ] .",
    "numerical procedure of the qhnc - md method and the results of its application to alkali liquid metals are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to a discussion , where the advantage / disadvantage of the qhnc - md method against the cp - md method is argued also .",
    "a simple liquid metal can be thought of as a binary mixture of ions with a definite ionic charge @xmath1 and the conduction electrons ; the interactions @xmath3 between particles [ @xmath4i or e ] are taken as pair - wise .",
    "the ions constitute a classical fluid , while the conduction electrons form a quantum fluid .",
    "let us refer to this mixture as the ion - electron model for a liquid metal .",
    "since the ions are regarded as classical particles in the electron - ion model , the ion - ion and electron - ion rdf s become identical with the ion- and electron - density distributions around a fixed ion in the mixture , respectively@xcite .",
    "because a fixed ion causes external potentials acting on ions and electrons in the homogeneous mixture , the df theory can give the exact expressions for the ion- and electron - density distributions , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in terms of those of noninteracting systems @xmath7 under effective external potentials @xmath8 [ @xmath9=i , e ] @xmath10 with the use of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the interaction part of the intrinsic free - energy and the chemical potential , respectively@xcite . as a result ,",

    "actually the explicit expression for the dcf s are given by the fourier transform in the matrix form @xmath27 in terms of the density response functions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , of the interacting and noninteracting systems , respectively , with @xmath30@xcite .",

    "a set of integral equations ( [ eq : gii ] ) and ( [ eq : gei ] ) are exact but formal expressions , as well as all other equations in the above .",
    "however , the ionic charge @xmath1 and the electron - ion interaction @xmath0 must be given beforehand , when we apply these formula to a liquid metal as an ion - electron mixture . in order to determine these quantities from first principle",
    ", a liquid metal must be treated more fundamentally as a mixture of nuclei and electrons ( the nucleus - electron model ) , where all interactions between particles are known as pure coulombic . in this model ,",

    "let us consider a liquid metal as a mixture of @xmath40 nuclei and @xmath41 electrons , and solve the problem to determine the electron - density distribution around a nucleus fixed at the origin in this mixture .",
    "since a fixed nucleus causes an external potential @xmath42 for this mixture to produce an inhomogeneous system , the df theory can be applied to this problem .",
    "it should be noticed that df theory contains some arbitrariness in the choice of a reference system to describe the system@xcite .",
    "we can get a simple description of the nucleus - electron mixture if the reference system is chosen to be a mixture consisting of @xmath43 noninteracting ions and @xmath44 noninteracting electrons : here , each ion is assumed to have @xmath45 bound - electrons with a charge distribution @xmath46 around it and an ionic charge @xmath47 . with use of this reference system , the df theory can provide an effective external potential @xmath48 for electrons around the fixed nucleus . then",
    ", the electron - density distribution @xmath49 around the fixed nucleus is obtained by solving the wave equation for @xmath48 in the sum of the bound- and free - electron parts : @xmath50 hence , the bound - electron distribution @xmath51 thus determined constitutes the definition of the  ion \" in the electron - ion model .",
    "furthermore , this bound - electron distribution @xmath51 should be taken identical with the electron distribution @xmath46 of an ion in the reference system , since the ion formed around the central nucleus is necessary to be the same structure as any ion in the system .",

    "this process will be continued until convergence of the effective ion - ion potential is achieved ( we refer to this procedure as the qhnc - md method ) .",
    "however , such a straight - forward repetition of the md simulation to solve the qhnc equations is not practical in the viewpoint of the computational cost .",
    "since the dependence of the effective ion - ion potential @xmath79 on the ionic configuration is rather weak in a simple metal as we have shown in @xcite , we can adopt an approximate theory for @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qhncii ] ) to get an initial @xmath79 for the qhnc - md method . for this purpose , we take the variational modified hnc ( vmhnc ) equation proposed by rosenfeld @xcite , in which the bridge function is approximated by @xmath83 of the percus - yevick equation for hard - spheres of diameter @xmath84 with the packing fraction @xmath85 . in the vmhnc equation ,",

    "then the md simulation is repeatedly performed to achieve convergence of @xmath79 in the _ refinement phase_.    there are two important points to be noticed regarding the md simulation when applied to the qhnc - md method .",
    "one is that the computer simulation provides the rdf @xmath92 only within the half of the side length @xmath93 of the simulation cell .",

    ", we solve the integral equation ( [ eq : qhncii ] ) for the full potential with use of this @xmath103 as an approximation to that of the full potential : this can be justified by the fact that the bridge function is not sensitive to the long - range part of the potential and becomes very weak for long - range distance @xcite .",
    "liquid alkali metals constitute  simple \" metals in the sense that the bound electrons forming an ion are clearly distinguished from the conduction electrons and the overlap of the core electrons are negligible ; the approximations ( a)(d ) used in the qhnc - md method become quit good ones for these metals .",
    "therefore , we have applied the qhnc - md method for five liquid alkali metals ( li , na , k , rb , and cs ) near the melting point using the parameters specified in table [ tab : param ] ; the temperature and density have been chosen to be compared with experimental data in @xcite . here ,",
    "the temperature and density of alkali liquids are specified by two dimensionless parameters : the plasma parameter @xmath106 and @xmath107 in units of the bohr radius @xmath108 , with the average ion - sphere radius @xmath109 .    in our application of the qhnc - md simulation to the alkali liquids , the local - field correction of the jellium model in eq .",

    "it is easily seen that the convergence of @xmath13 is very fast ; the difference of @xmath13 between run-1 and run-2 is situated almost within the statistical error of the sampling of the rdf in the md simulation : this means accuracy of about 3 to 4 digits is already achieved in the qhnc - md calculation of run-1 . in a consistent way to the convergence of the rdf , a good convergence of the effective ion - ion potential @xmath79 is achieved in run-1 .",
    "similar to the case of liquid li , a good convergence of @xmath13 and @xmath79 is also achieved for other liquid metals .",
    "it should be noted that the preparation phase of the qhnc - md method largely enhances the convergence of @xmath79 .",
    "concerning the treatment of the raw md data for the ion - ion rdf , it should be emphasized that the extension procedure@xcite to obtain the rdf for the full potential applied to the raw md data is indispensable for the present calculation .",

    "[ fig : ligrdiff ] , where the truncation error in @xmath13 due to the use of the cutoff potential in the md simulation is so large that the convergence of the qhnc - md method will not be attained with the raw rdf data .",
    "in addition , the extended rdf for the full potential is almost identical with the result of vmhnc equation for the same potential ( figure [ fig : ligrdiff ] ) for @xmath121 , i.e. , after the third peak of rdf .",
    "this suggests that the long ranged friedel oscillation of @xmath79 typically seen for liquid metals is essential for the detailed structure of the rdf at long distances , and it is necessary to include the information of the long - range part of @xmath79 into @xmath13 in order to obtain a self - consistent solution of the effective ion - ion potential by the qhnc - md calculation .",
    "it is concluded that the convergence of the present qhnc - md simulation is well attained from both numerical and computational points of view , helped by a good initial estimation from the vmhnc equation in the preparation phase ; the extension procedure to obtain the full - range rdf for the uncut effective potential is also necessary to get the convergence .",

    "the discrepancy in the bridge function between the md simulation and vmhnc equation gives no serious effects on the first peak of the rdf .",

    "the relativistic effect may contribute to the calculation of the structure factor , since its atomic number @xmath129 is rather large ; there is a possibility that this effect may be ascribed to this small discrepancy between the calculated and experimental results in cs structure factor . in the same way as shown in the li structure factor ,",
    "the qhnc - vm structure factors deviate from the qhnc - md results near the their second peak for na , k , rb and cs as seen figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "this second - peak difference between the qhnc - md and qhnc - vm structure factors brings about a distinct difference in the rdf s obtained from their fourier transform , as can be seen from an example of na shown in fig .",
    "thus , the rdf from the vmhnc equation is found not so exact as to compare with details of experimental results for alkali liquids ; the qhnc - md method is shown to produce reliable results for all alkali liquids .",
    "next , we proceed to discuss the electronic structure around ion .",
    "the electron - ion rdf s from the qhnc - md method are shown in fig .  8 for the case of rb at temperature 313",
    "k together with the ion - ion rdf .",
    "the electron - ion structure factor @xmath130 is represented in the form@xcite : @xmath131 in terms of the ion - ion structure factor and the charge distribution of the pseudoatom : @xmath132 with the help of the above equations , the pseudopotential method using the ashcroft model potential can evaluate the electron - ion rdf by inserting it in ( [ eq : rhoq ] ) instead of @xmath133 ; its result using the empty core radius 1.27@xmath134 has no inner - core structure near the origin as is expected . in the qhnc - md method ,",
    "we need not introduce any pseudization in treating the core region .",
    "therefore , the electron - ion rdf @xmath14 exhibits the inner - core structure similar to a free - atom as is shown in fig .",
    "8 in contrast with result of the pseudopotential method ( full circles ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the electron - ion rdf has an oscillation with an inverse phase to that of the ion - ion rdf , since the electrons are pushed away by an ion as a whole in the core region .",
    "the charge distribution @xmath122 of the pseudoatom in a liquid rb has a similar structure to the distribution @xmath135 of the @xmath136-electrons in the free - atom ; therefore , the total electron - density distribution @xmath137 is almost same to that of a free atom as was indicated by ziman .",
    "also , note that the positions of the dips in the electron - ion rdf are coincident with those appeared in the @xmath138electron charge distribution @xmath135 in a free - atom ; these dips in the electron - ion rdf reflect the inner structure of an ion in a metal .",
    "the electron - ion rdf s of liquid alkali metals ( li , na , k , rb and cs ) are shown in fig .",
    "10 , where the inner - core structure is omitted near the origin in each curve .",
    "the dip in the electron - ion rdf becomes shallower and is shifted to the right side indicating the growth of the core size , as the atomic number increases from na to cs : the curve of li shows an exception to this tendency .",
    "when the electron - ion rdf is determined by solving the wave equation for the self - consistent potential @xmath139 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qhncei ] ) the electron - ion dcf @xmath77 , which yields an effective ion - ion potential @xmath79 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) . corresponding to each curves of @xmath140 in fig .",
    "10 , the effective ion - ion potential @xmath79 is determined for each element as shown in fig .",
    "it should be emphasized that there is no units for scaling lengths and energies to effective ion - ion potentials determined by the qhnc - md method in contrast with those obtained by using the ashcroft model potential@xcite .",
    "similarly , no scaling features are found in the effective ion - ion potential obtained by the dagens - rasolt - taylor method@xcite , which can be thought of as an approximation to the qhnc formulation in the sense that the ion - ion rdf is there replaced by the spherical vacancy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vefen])@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown that for liquid alkali metals near the melting point the ion - ion rdf s from the qhnc - md method can be scaled almost into one curve by taking the average ion radius @xmath109 in the units of length as indicated in fig .",
    "12 except cs .    as the summarization of this section",
    ", we conclude that the present application of the qhnc - md method to liquid alkali metals provides the ionic structures in excellent agreement with the experiments within the computational capacity available at present , enabling to handle a relatively large system size in the md simulation in contrast with the usual _ ab initio _",
    "simulation for the electron - ion mixture .",
    "so as to be consistent with the ionic structure specified by the ion - ion rdf , the qhnc - md method is shown to give the electron - ion rdf @xmath14 , the charge distribution @xmath122 of a pseudoatom and the density distribution @xmath123 of the bound electrons forming an ion in a liquid metal at the same time ; alternatively this electronic structure produces the ion - ion potential @xmath79 used for the md simulation .",
    "we have shown that the qhnc - md formulation provides a very precise description of simple liquid metals at any state from the atomic number @xmath39 as the only input : this method is proven to yield a first - principles calculation . our previous calculations with the vmhnc equation , which has been used for input to the qhnc - md method , generated the structure factors with a small but systematic deviation from experiments near the second peak .",
    "now our qhnc - md method is shown to correct this deviation and to yield results in excellent agreement with experiments in the whole range of wavenumber @xmath128 .",
    "even in alkali metals , there is no scaling unit of lengths and energies for the effective ion - ion potentials @xmath79 determined from the qhnc - md method ; each potential is different from other and reflects a difference in the bound - electron structure of an ion in each metal .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the effective potential calculated by use of the ashcroft pseudopotential , which leads to give almost single potential curve for all alkali liquids if scaled with the proper unit@xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the ion - ion rdf s can be scaled by the unit of @xmath109 , the average ion - sphere radius , which enables plot the results in almost single curve for alkali liquids (",
    "li , na , k , rb ) near the melting point except the case of cs .",
    "this fact was already found in the experimental results for the structure factors@xcite .    in our qhnc - md formulation ,",
    "the exchange - correlation effect expressed by the lfc @xmath141 and the lda @xmath59 are introduced from outside the framework of our formulation : those of the jellium model , where the ion distribution is replaced by the positive uniform background .",
    "the jellium model gives a good description for the electrons in alkali metals ; the present success of the qhnc - md method depends on this fact .",
    "in addition , the structure factors of alkali metals calculated by this method are almost independent of what kind of lfc to choose .",
    "however , it should be noted that the lfc in the qhnc formulation should depend on the ion configuration precisely , since it is defined for the electron - electron dcf in the electron - ion mixture .    to compare the md structure factors with experiments in detail , it is important to extrapolate the md rdf to large distances and to correct errors caused by the cut effective ion - ion potential used in the md simulation .",
    "our extrapolation method@xcite is shown very efficient in dealing with the raw md data for a liquid metal with ion - ion potential accompanied by a long - range friedel oscillation ; this extrapolation method is indispensable to obtain a convergent solution in the qhnc - md method . in order to obtain so reliable bridge function for the extrapolation of the md rdf , it is necessary to get a reasonable statistical accuracy for evaluation of the rdf ;",
    "for this purpose , the md simulation must be performed for at least several thousand particles taking about @xmath142 to @xmath143 samples @xcite .",
    "the car - parrinello md ( cp - md ) method is based on the same ground to the qhnc - md method : the electron - ion mixture model for liquid metals and the jellium model for electrons , which are treated by the df theory . also , the bare ion - ion interaction is taken as a pure coulombic in both treatment . however , in the cp - md method , the bare electron - ion interaction is approximated by a pseudopotential , which is introduced from outside of the cp - md formulation ; this fact makes a contrast with our qhnc - md method where it is obtained self - consistently within the framework of the qhnc formulation and no pseudization is necessary in treating the core region . as a consequence",
    ", the electron - ion rdf extracted from the cp - md result does not have an inner core structure .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the qhnc formulation the inner electronic structure around a fixed nucleus , such as the electron - ion rdf in the core region and the bound - electron distribution @xmath123 of an ion in a liquid metal , is determined to be consistent with the outer structure , that is , with the surrounding ion and electron configurations .",
    "therefore , the qhnc - md method can be applied to a high density plasma , where a usual pseudopotential can not be constructed due to the fact the atomic structure in a highly compressed plasma state is quite different from that in the vacuum .",
    "while in the cp - md treatment the electron distribution is determined for the multi - ion configuration and the ions are considered to be interacting via many - body forces , our approach deals with the one - center problem to determine the electron and ion distributions around a fixed ion in a liquid metal . as this connection",
    ", it should be kept in mind that the electron - ion mixture can be exactly taken as a quasi one - component system interacting only via a _ pairwise _ interaction in the evaluation of the ion - ion rdf for simple liquid metals .",
    "the advantage of the present method against the cp - md method based on the usual pseudopotential theory can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the present procedure is capable to handle a large system size ( @xmath144 @xmath145 to @xmath146 particles ) in the md simulation within the computational resources available at present , helped by the good initial guess with the vmhnc approximation for solving the qhnc equation .",
    "( 2 ) in the qhnc - md method , the many - body forces and nonlinear effect in the electron screening are taken into account automatically in the form of a pairwise interaction in such a way that the nonlinear pseudopotential is constructed in terms of @xmath77 .",
    "( 3 ) by setting up an additional integral equation for @xmath64 , our method can treat the case where the jellium model for the electrons in a metal breaks down , that is , where the exchange - correlation effect begins to depend on the the ion configuration@xcite . therefore",
    ", ( 4 ) our method is applicable to high density plasmas where the ionic structure becomes significantly so different from a free atom due to high compression that the usual pseudopotential theory can not be applied .",
    "the qhnc - md method is developed on the base of the ion - electron model , where the bound electrons are assumed to be clearly distinguished from the conduction electrons and the ions are so rigid and so small that the ion - ion bare interaction is taken as a pure coulombic @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , our method is applicable only to a simple metallic system . in a transition metal , for example , an  ion \" can not be clearly defined since the bound electrons are not distinct from the conduction electron , and the overlap of  ions \" is significant : many - body interactions becomes important .",
    "our method can not be applied to such a case . while the cp - md method treat electrons in the multi - center problem , our method treat them as the single - center problem to determine the density distribution around an fixed ion in a liquid metal .",
    "thus , our method can not describe states of the electrons in a multi - center configuration , such as the density of states .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that an orbital of an ion determined by the qhnc - md simulation may be taken as an average orbital in some sense compared with that determined the cp - md simulation : there , many - body forces are changing at every time - step , while the binary ion - ion interaction remains constant at every time - step in the qhnc - md simulation .",
    "already , we have proposed a method to treat non - simple metals@xcite ; the rdf s , the ionic charge and the muffin - tin potential are determined by solving a single - center problem with a bare ion - ion interaction as an input , while the density of states , the bare ion - ion interaction and the thermodynamic properties are to be obtained as results of the multi - center problem with use of output from the single - center problem .",
    "the cp - md method can produce the electron - ion rdf and the electron - ion structure @xmath130 is obtained from its fourier transform .",
    "thus , the charge distribution @xmath148 of a neutral pseudoatom can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoq ] ) even in the cp - md simulation , since the relation ( [ eq : sei2 ] ) between @xmath148 and @xmath130 is exact if a liquid metal can be treated as a ion - electron mixture .",
    "also , the electron - ion dcf @xmath149 is determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoq ] ) to give an effective ion - ion interaction @xmath79 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) ; these quantities must be consistent to the ion - ion structure factor @xmath124 , if the lfc @xmath141 in the electron - electron dcf @xmath64 is chosen exact one in the electron - ion mixture . in this connection",
    ", there is a point to notice regarding the cp - md method that the exchange - correlation effect of the valence electrons is treated by the lda approximation : the lfc @xmath141 does not appear in the cp - md method .",
    "this consistency test in the cp - md method can be exemplified by applying it to liquid alkali metals , which are typical examples of the electron - ion model . at the same time , these quantities in the cp - md method can be compared with the results of the qhnc - md method , both methods providing first principles calculations .",
