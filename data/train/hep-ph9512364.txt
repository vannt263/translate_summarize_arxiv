    "neutrino telescopes hold great promise for probing the deepest reaches of stars and galaxies @xcite . as highly stable neutral particles ,",
    "neutrinos arrive at a detector on a direct line from their source , undeflected by intervening magnetic fields .",
    "whereas high - energy photons are completely absorbed by a few hundred grams/@xmath6 of material , the interaction length of a 1-tev neutrino is about 250 kilotonnes/@xmath6 , which corresponds to a column of water 2.5 million kilometers deep .",
    "the feebleness of neutrino interactions means that neutrinos can bring us astrophysical information that other radiation can not , but it also means that vast detectors are required to receive this information .    encouragement to contemplate neutrino telescopes with effective volumes as large as 1  km@xmath7 comes from the observation of neutrinos correlated with supernova sn1987a @xcite and from the detection of solar neutrinos not only by radiochemical methods @xcite but also by observing the direction of recoil electrons from neutrino interactions @xcite . at the same time , detection of neutrinos produced by cosmic - ray interactions in earth s atmosphere @xcite has become commonplace in underground detectors @xcite and has emerged as a tool for investigating neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "a principal scientific goal of large - scale neutrino telescopes is the detection of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe : @xmath8 ) cosmic neutrinos produced outside the atmosphere : neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas , and extragalactic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "extragalactic sources range from the conventional  the diffuse ( @xmath9 ) neutrino flux produced by interactions over cosmological time of extragalactic cosmic rays with the microwave background radiation @xcite  to the highly speculative  such as the diffuse flux associated with the decay of cosmic strings @xcite and other topological defects @xcite in the relatively late universe .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have long been considered as prodigious particle accelerators @xcite and beam dumps @xcite , for they are the most powerful radiation sources known in the universe , with typical luminosities in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "these cosmic accelerators are presumably powered by the gravitational energy of matter spiraling in to a supermassive ( @xmath12 ) black hole .",
    "cosmic rays generated within an agn may interact with matter or radiation in the agn accretion disk , or with uv photons in the associated jets , to produce pions whose decay products include photons and neutrinos .",
    "the dominant mechanisms for photon and neutrino production are and if @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are produced in equal numbers , the relative populations of the neutral particles will be @xmath16 . taken together , neutrino emission from ordinary agns may provide the dominant isotropic flux at energies above about @xmath17 .",
    "the recent detection of energetic photons ( @xmath18 ) from some 40 agns in the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) full - sky survey @xcite may signal the existence of individual point - sources of neutrinos .",
    "egret , a multilevel thin - plate spark chamber device aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , has also detected more than a dozen extragalactic sources at photon energies above @xmath19 .",
    "the egret sources have the characteristics of _ blazars , _ agns that have associated jets closely aligned with the observer s line of sight .",
    "the closest egret source is markarian 421 , a bl lacertae object at redshift @xmath20 . in 1992 , mrk 421 was detected in air showers as a source of tev photons by the ground - based whipple observatory , an optical reflector with a 10-meter aperture viewed by more than 100 small phototubes @xcite . in 1995 ,",
    "the whipple observatory gamma - ray collaboration detected a second tev photon source , mrk 501 , at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if the tev photons are products of @xmath15 decay , then these sources should also be copious neutrino emitters .",
    "if instead the tev photons are produced by inverse compton scattering of energetic electrons off ultraviolet photons , no uhe neutrinos will be created . the ability to observe uhe neutrinos from tev photon sources would be an important new agn diagnostic .",
    "ultrahigh - energy neutrinos can be detected by observing long - range muons produced in charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "to reduce the background from muons produced in the atmosphere , it is advantageous to site a neutrino telescope at a depth of several kilometers ( water equivalent ) or to observe upward - going muons .",
    "high neutrino energy brings a number of advantages .",
    "first , the charged - current cross section increases , as @xmath22 for @xmath23 , then as @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "second , the background of atmospheric neutrinos falls away compared to the flux from extragalactic sources , approximately as @xmath26 .",
    "cosmic neutrinos reflect the cosmic - ray spectrum near the source ( @xmath27 ) , whereas the atmospheric neutrino spectrum ( @xmath28 above @xmath29 ) is about one power of the energy steeper than the cosmic - ray spectrum at the earth ( @xmath30 ) , which is steeper than the source spectrum @xcite .",
    "the signal of interest for neutrino astronomy should emerge from the atmospheric - neutrino background at @xmath31 .",
    "third , the muon range grows with energy , increasing as @xmath32 for @xmath33 , then increasing roughly as @xmath34 at higher energies . for upward - going muons ,",
    "the effective volume of a neutrino telescope is thus equal to the instrumented area times the muon range .",
    "estimates of the fluxes of uhe neutrinos from agns and other astrophysical sources suggest that a surface area exceeding @xmath35 is required @xcite .",
    "if the muons are detected by observing the erenkov light they produce when traversing a transparent medium of water or ice , huge target volumes are conceivable @xcite .",
    "four instruments specifically designed for high - energy neutrino detection are currently under construction : dumand @xcite , at a depth of 4760  m in the ocean 30  km off the island of hawaii ; the baikal neutrino telescope @xcite , at a depth of 1  km in lake baikal in siberia ; nestor @xcite , 3500  m deep in the mediterranean near pylos , greece ; and amanda @xcite , in deep polar ice at the south pole",
    ". all these detectors aim for effective areas of about @xmath36 and an angular resolution for tev muons of approximately @xmath37 .",
    "these detectors represent a giant step in instrumented volume from their underground predecessors . to reach an effective volume of @xmath38 will require efficiencies of scale for the water - erenkov technique or new means of detection .",
    "radio detection is under active study @xcite .",
    "acoustic detection may become viable in the future @xcite .    at low neutrino energies ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the intermediate - boson mass and @xmath41 is the nucleon mass ) , differential and total cross sections for the reaction @xmath42 are proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "above @xmath43 , the gauge - boson propagator restricts the momentum transfer @xmath44 to values near @xmath45 and damps the cross section . at ultrahigh energies ,",
    "the @xmath46 propagator limits the effective interval in the fractional parton momentum @xmath47 to the region around @xmath48 .",
    "since the uhe @xmath49 cross sections were studied in detail nearly a decade ago @xcite , our knowledge of parton distributions has developed significantly . in place of parton distributions that were essentially based on a single data set @xcite , we now have at our disposal a number of sets of parton distributions derived from global fits to a rich universe of experimental information . at small values of @xmath47 ,",
    "parton distributions have been shaped by measurements made possible for the first time by the electron - proton collider hera at desy .",
    "the discovery of the top quark @xcite with a mass @xmath50 reduces the contribution of the @xmath51-quark sea to the neutrino - nucleon total cross section .",
    "this new information provides the incentive to rexamine the cross sections for uhe @xmath49 interactions @xcite .    in  [ sec :",
    "pdf ] , we review what is known about the structure of the nucleon and explain how we treat the extrapolation to small values of @xmath47 that is crucial at the highest energies . then in  [ sec : cc ] we present in turn our calculations of the charged - current and neutral - current cross sections , and explore the variations due to different sets of parton distributions .",
    "although @xmath49 interactions provide the dominant signal and account for most of the attenuation of neutrino beams in the earth at high energies , the @xmath52 resonance in the @xmath53 channel has a very strong effect for neutrino energies around @xmath54 .",
    "accordingly , we review the interactions of neutrinos with electron targets in  [ sec : nue ] .",
    "section [ sec : opq ] is devoted to a study of the attenuation of neutrinos in the earth .",
    "we improve our treatment of this important effect by using a detailed model of the earth s interior .",
    "we make some remarks about neutrino interactions in the atmosphere in  [ sec : atm ] , and comment in  [ sec : shad ] on the possibility of observing the shadows of the moon and sun . in  [ sec : rates ] we estimate the event rates from atmospheric neutrinos and from a variety of astrophysical sources in detectors with effective volumes of @xmath55 .",
    "a final assessment concludes the paper .",
    "we find that current knowledge of the proton s parton distributions allows us to calculate the @xmath49 cross sections with confidence up to neutrino energies of about @xmath56 .",
    "the new cross sections are noticeably larger than those calculated a decade ago for energies above about @xmath57 . at @xmath58 ,",
    "our nominal cross sections are about 2.4 times as large as those calculated using the ehlq parton distributions @xcite . at energies exceeding @xmath56 ,",
    "our ignorance of proton structure at small values of @xmath47 is reflected in a spread of the cross sections calculated using various modern parton distributions .",
    "the resulting uncertainty reaches a factor of @xmath59 at @xmath58 .",
    "the larger cross sections imply enhanced rates for downward - going muons produced in charged - current interactions . at the energies of interest for the observation of extraterrestrial neutrino sources , upward - going muon rates are little changed , because the increased reaction rate is compensated by increased attenuation of neutrinos traversing the earth to reach the detector .",
    "we find that a detector with an effective area of @xmath60 and a muon energy threshold in the range of @xmath61 to @xmath62 should readily observe the diffuse flux of neutrinos expected from agns above the background of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the detection of cosmic neutrinos from the interaction of cosmic - ray protons with the microwave background appears a remote possibility , even for a 1-km@xmath7 detector .",
    "to compute the cross sections for neutrino - nucleon interactions at high energies , we require both a knowledge of the elementary matrix elements and also a detailed description of the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "we have the first , thanks to extensive experimental validation of the @xmath63 electroweak theory and refinement of the parameters that appear in the elementary neutrino - quark scattering . for the second , we rely on parton distribution functions extracted from studies of lepton - hadron scattering and of the productions of jets , intermediate bosons , dileptons , and photons in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "systematic global fits to experimental data have greatly extended our knowledge of parton distribution functions and made modern parametrizations increasingly robust .",
    "although many experiments have nourished the steady improvement of the parton distributions , recent results from the @xmath64 collider hera @xcite are particularly informative for the application at hand .",
    "measurements by the zeus and h1 collaborations mark the first experimental studies of very small parton momentum fractions @xmath47 at momentum transfers @xmath44 securely in the deeply inelastic regime .",
    "the hera experiments have begun to map the structure function @xmath65 in the interval @xmath66 , with @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath69 has been measured over a significant range in @xmath44 .    for most hard - scattering applications in particle physics ,",
    "it is straightforward to begin with parametrizations of parton distribution functions tied to data at modest values of @xmath44 and evolve them to the desired high scale using the altarelli - parisi equations @xcite .",
    "the special challenge of uhe neutrino - nucleon scattering is that the @xmath46-boson propagator emphasizes smaller and smaller values of @xmath47 as the neutrino energy @xmath70 increases . in the uhe domain ,",
    "the most important contributions to the @xmath49 cross section come from @xmath71 .",
    "up to @xmath72 , the parton distributions are sampled only at values of @xmath47 where they have been constrained by experiment . at still higher energies ,",
    "we require parton distributions at such small values of @xmath47 that direct experimental constraints are not available , not even at low values of @xmath44 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties that enter the evaluation of the uhe neutrino - nucleon cross section arise from the low-@xmath44 parametrization , the evolution of the parton distribution functions to large values of @xmath73 , and the extrapolation to small values of @xmath47 .",
    "the greatest uncertainty is due to the small-@xmath47 extrapolation .",
    "because experiments are limited to values of @xmath74 , fits to structure functions have to be based on plausible but poorly constrained extrapolations to @xmath75 .",
    "the parton distributions are traditionally obtained by assuming compact forms at @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a valence - quark distribution , @xmath79 is a sea - quark distribution , and @xmath80 is the gluon distribution .",
    "the functions @xmath81 are polynomials in @xmath82 that satisfy @xmath83 .",
    "sum rules provide broad constraints on the parameters .",
    "for example , the requirement that the momentum integral of the gluon distribution be finite means that @xmath84 must be less singular than @xmath85 at @xmath75 .",
    "the parameters are determined from fits to experimental data and the resulting forms are evolved to higher values of @xmath44 using the next - to - leading order altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "we employ in this work the latest ( cteq3 ) of the parton distributions determined by the cteq collaboration @xcite and several sets ( mrs a , g , d _ , and d_ ) from the family of parton distributions produced by martin , roberts , and stirling @xcite . both the cteq and mrs parametrizations result from global fits to vast data sets and obey sum - rule constraints .",
    "currently there are two theoretical approaches , both based on perturbative qcd , to understanding the @xmath44-evolution of small-@xmath47 parton distributions .",
    "the traditional approach , followed in the cteq3 @xcite and in the mrs a @xcite and g @xcite distributions , is to determine parton densities for @xmath86 by solving the next - to - leading - order altarelli - parisi evolution equations numerically .",
    "the second approach to small-@xmath47 evolution is to solve the balitski - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation , which is effectively a leading @xmath87 resummation of soft gluon emissions @xcite . in practical terms ,",
    "the small-@xmath47 behavior is an input at some scale @xmath88 in the traditional approach , and a dynamically generated output in the bfkl scheme .",
    "the bfkl approach predicts a singular behavior in @xmath47 and a rapid @xmath44-variation , @xmath89 applying the altarelli - parisi equations to singular input distributions @xmath90 leads to @xmath91 a less rapid growth with @xmath44 .",
    "the altarelli - parisi approach is applicable in the not - so - small-@xmath47 and large-@xmath92 region , while the bfkl solution applies to the small-@xmath47 and moderate-@xmath92 region .",
    "bfkl evolution eventually breaks down at large @xmath44 , because of the rapid growth exhibited in ( [ eqn : bfkl ] ) . in the case of ultrahigh - energy neutrino - nucleon interactions ,",
    "the region of interest is small-@xmath47 and large-@xmath92 , which requires a resummation of both @xmath93 and @xmath94 contributions .",
    "although some progress has been made in developing a `` unified '' evolution equation @xcite , the full solution and global fits to data are far from being achieved .",
    "the standard altarelli - parisi evolution of the parton distribution functions is applicable for the calculation of the total neutrino cross section up to @xmath95 gev , so it is a reasonable starting point for calculating the cross section for higher energy neutrinos .",
    "consequently , the calculation of the total neutrino - nucleon cross section presented here relies on the cteq3 and mrs a parton distributions obtained using next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) evolution equations .",
    "the cteq3 distribution functions , depending on the order of the evolution and the factorization scheme , use @xmath96 , while @xmath97 for mrs a. the cteq3 distributions are particularly convenient as a benchmark because the numerical evolution is provided for @xmath98 , including the region in which the altarelli - parisi equations may not be reliable .",

    "this consonance allows us to make confident predictions of the @xmath49 cross sections for neutrino energies up to about @xmath124 .",
    "the spread in the parton distributions at smaller values of @xmath47 reflects the uncertain extrapolation toward @xmath75 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the inclusive cross section for the reaction @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an isoscalar nucleon , in the renormalization group - improved parton model .",

    "consequently we drop the contribution of the top sea . at the energies of interest here",
    ", it is a sound kinematical simplification to treat charm and bottom quarks as massless .",

    "@xmath145 , the familiar manifestation of the qcd evolution of the parton distributions is to degrade the valence component , and so to decrease the total cross section . at still higher energies , the gauge - boson propagator restricts @xmath146 to values near @xmath45 , and so limits the effective interval in @xmath47 to the region around @xmath147 .",
    "figure [ fig : x ] shows the contributions to the cross section from different regions of @xmath47 . at modest values of @xmath44 , the effect of this @xmath46-propagator",

    "the valence contribution is even smaller than the contribution of the @xmath148 sea .",
    "a second effect of qcd evolution is to increase the population of heavy quarks ( @xmath149 ) within the proton , and to increase the importance of the light - quark sea at small values of @xmath47 .",
    "andreev , berezinsky , and smirnov @xcite have pointed out that the effect of this growth in the density of the parton sea is to enhance the cross section at high energies .",
    "this effect is apparent in figure [ fig : oldnew ] .",
    "there we compare the cteq3 cross section with the 1986 cross section @xcite based on the ehlq structure functions and with the case of no evolution .",
    "we see that the ehlq - based cross section is enhanced by fully an order of magnitude at high energies by the evolution of the sea . at low energies ,",
    "the decrease in the cross section brought about by the degradation of the valence distribution is apparent in the comparison of the ehlq curves with and without evolution .",
    "we also show in figure [ fig : oldnew ] the cteq3 prediction for the @xmath150 charged - current cross section .    at the highest energies , where the contributions of valence quarks are unimportant , the neutrino and antineutrino cross sections are identical .",
    "our new evaluation of the @xmath49 cross section differs from the earlier calculations at both low and high energies . at both extremes ,",
    "the difference is owed to changes in our understanding of parton distribution functions .",
    "the ehlq parton distributions , on which the earlier calculations were based , were based on the cern - dortmund - heidelberg - saclay measurements of neutrino - nucleon structure functions @xcite .",
    "we now know that the normalization of the cdhs structure functions was about 15% low @xcite .",
    "the change in normalization directly affects the cross sections at low energies . at higher energies , which are sensitive to small values of @xmath47 , the shape of the parton distribution as @xmath111 is decisive . at low @xmath44 ,",
    "the ehlq distributions @xmath151 are finite as @xmath111 , whereas hera experiments point to singular behavior , parametrized in the cteq distributions as @xmath152 .",

    "the most singular ( mrs d _ ) distribution predicts a significantly higher cross section than the others . above about @xmath124 ,",
    "the ehlq - dla distributions yield noticeably smaller cross sections than the modern distributions .",

    "the peaking of the cross section near @xmath161 , which becomes increasingly prominent with increasing neutrino energy , is a direct consequence of the cutoff in @xmath44 enforced by the @xmath46 propagator .",

    "the range of signal events reflects the spread in predictions of the diffuse neutrino flux from agns .",
    "the outlook for the detection of cosmic neutrinos at energies around @xmath181 is less encouraging . even in a detector with an effective volume of @xmath182 , the most favorable model for the cosmic - neutrino flux",
    "leads to less than one event per steradian - year with @xmath183 .",

    "we are optimistic that progress toward large - volume neutrino telescopes , initially based on water - erenkov and ice - erenkov techniques , will soon lead to the detection of ultrahigh - energy neutrinos from extraterrestrial sources . with the ability to detect uhe neutrinos will come the possibility of looking deep within some of the most energetic structures in the universe . for neutrino energies up to @xmath56 , which spans the range of interest for testing models of active galactic nuclei ,",
