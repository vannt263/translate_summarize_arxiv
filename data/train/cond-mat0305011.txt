    "according to the scaling theory of localization@xcite , all electrons in a disordered two - dimensional system are localized in the absence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath0 , a series of disorder - broadened landau bands ( lbs ) will appear , and an extended state resides at the center of each band while states at other energies are localized@xcite . the integrally quantized hall plateaus ( iqhp )",
    "are observed when the fermi level lies in localized states , with the value of the hall conductance , @xmath1 , related to the number of occupied extended states(@xmath2 ) .",
    "many previous studies@xcite have been focused on so - called plateau transitions .",
    "the issue there is how the hall conductance jumps from one quantized value to another when the fermi level crosses an extended state .",
    "there are two competing proposals .",
    "one is the global phase diagram@xcite based on the levitation of extended states conjectured by khmelnitskii@xcite and laughlin@xcite .",
    "a crucial prediction of this phase diagram is that an integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) state @xmath2 in general can only go into another iqhe states @xmath3 , and that a transition into an insulating state is allowed only from the @xmath4 state .",
    "the other is so - called direct transition phase diagram@xcite in which transitions from any iqhe state to the insulating phase are allowed when the disorder is increased at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "so far , most experiments@xcite are consistent with the direct transition phase diagram although the early experiments were interpreted in terms of the global phase diagram .",
    "one important yet overlooked issue regarding iqhe is the _ nature _ of both plateau - plateau and plateau - insulator transitions . in all existing theoretical studies ,",
    "these transitions are assumed to be continuous quantum phase transitions .",
    "this assumption is mainly due to the early scaling experiments@xcite .",
    "the fingerprint of a continuous phase transition is scaling laws around the transition point . in the case of iqhe ,",
    "it means algebraic divergence of the slope of the longitudinal resistance in temperature @xmath5 at the transition point .",
    "however , recent experiments@xcite showed that such slopes remain finite when the curves are extrapolated to @xmath6 .",
    "this implies a _ non - scaling _ behavior around a transition point , contradicting the expectation of continuous quantum phase transitions suggested by the theories .",
    "thus the nature of these transitions should be re - examined .",
    "the samples used in the non - scaling experiments@xcite are relatively dirty , and strong disorders should lead to a strong inter - landau - band mixing . in a recent letter@xcite",
    ", we showed that the single extended state at each lb center broadens into a narrow band of extended states when the interband mixing of _ opposite chirality _ is taken into account .",
    "a narrow metallic phase exists between two adjacent iqhe phases and between an iqhe phase and the insulating phase .",
    "a plateau - plateau transition corresponds to two consecutive quantum phase transitions instead of one as suggested by existing theories . in this paper",
    "we shall present the detailed description of this study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the semiclassical network model for two coupled lbs is illustrated in sec .",
    "it is shown that mixing of localized states of _ opposite chirality _ tends to delocalize a state while mixing of states of the same chirality does not .",
    "our approach , level - statistics technique , is described in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv our numerical results and discussions are presented , and the original data from the non - scaling experiments are reanalyzed according to two quantum phase transition points in each iqhp - insulator transition .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are summarized in sec .",
    "according to the semiclassical theory@xcite , the motion of an electron in a strong magnetic field and in a smooth random potential can be decomposed into a rapid cyclotron motion and a slow drifting motion of its guiding center .",
    "the kinetic energy of the cyclotron motion is quantized by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath2 the lb index .",
    "the trajectory of the drifting motion of the guiding center is thus along an equipotential contour of value @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total energy of the electron .",
    "the local drifting velocity @xmath11 is determined by ( in si unit ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the local potential gradient .",
    "the equipotential contour consists of many closed loops .",
    "neglect quantum tunneling effects , each loop corresponds to trajectory of one eigenstate .",
    "the motion of electrons are thus confined around these loops with deviations typically order of the cyclotron radius @xmath14 .    .",
    "dashed lines denote quantum tunnelings .",
    "the arrows indicate the drifting direction .",
    "( b ) loops localized around a valley and a peak , respectively .",
    "the arrows inside a loop show the directions of local potential gradient around the peak or valley .",
    "the arrows on a loop indicate the drifting direction.,width=302,height=166 ]    to illustrate this semiclassical picture , let us think of the smooth random potential as a landscape of many peaks and valleys distributed randomly in the plane .",
    "imagine that the landscape is filled with water up to a surface with the height of value @xmath15 .",
    "the equipotential contour of value @xmath15 is thus the intersection between the land and the water . according to the percolation theory@xcite ,",
    "the percolation threshold of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) continuum model is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the occupation probability of the medium ( the land or the water ) . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the distribution of the random potential is symmetric around zero . by symmetry",
    "the percolation point of both the land and the water is at @xmath18 in this case . when @xmath19 , the occupation probability of land is above @xmath20 .",
    "thus the land percolates and the water forms isolated lakes .",
    "these lakes are around valleys and their boundaries correspond to trajectories of localized states . in the case of @xmath21 ,",
    "the water forms a percolating sea and the land becomes isolated islands around potential peaks .",
    "the boundary of each island is an electronic state . in short , semiclassical electronic states in a qh system",
    "are equipotential loops .",
    "these loops are localized around potential peaks for @xmath21 and around potential valleys for @xmath19 .",
    "the drifting direction of each loop is _ unidirectional_.",
    "this means that they are chiral states . from eq .",
    "[ drift ] one can see that states around a peak have _ opposite chirality _ from states around a valley because the directions of the local potential gradients around a peak are opposite to those around a valley .",
    "if one views the plane from the direction opposite to the magnetic field , the drifting is clockwise around valleys and counter - clockwise around peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1channel ] .",
    "right at @xmath18 both the land and the water percolate , and the intersection between them is the trajectory of an extended state .",
    "it means that there is only one extended state at @xmath18 for each lb . as @xmath15 approaches zero from both sides",
    ", the localization length @xmath22 of the system tends to diverge as @xmath23 where the critical exponent @xmath24 according to the classical percolation theory .",
    "quantum effects are ignored in the above semiclassical argument .",
    "when two spatially separated loops on the same equipotential contour come close at saddle points of the random potential , quantum tunnelings should be considered .",
    "an example in the case of @xmath19 is shown in fig . [ 1channel](a ) . in the absence of interband",
    "mixing , numerical calculations have suggested that there is still only one extended state in each lb while the value of the critical exponent @xmath25 is modified to be around @xmath26@xcite .",
    "is the density of states . @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the centers of the two bands .",
    "( b ) two sets of equipotential contours for electronic states of energy @xmath10 shown in ( a ) .",
    "one is from the lower band with @xmath29 , and the other from the upper band with @xmath30 .",
    "the ellipses denote the loops and arrows on them show drifting directions .",
    "the solid curve is the schematic plot of the random potential .",
    "two dashed horizontal lines indicate two constant potential planes .",
    "@xmath31 is the magnetic field.,width=302,height=264 ]    in the case of strong disorders or weak magnetic field , the width of the lbs is comparable with the spacing between adjacent lbs ( the landau gap ) , and inter - landau - band mixings should no longer be ignored . in order to investigate the consequences of inter - landau - band mixing",
    ", we shall consider a simple system of two adjacent lbs .",
    "since we are interested in interband - mixing of opposite chirality , we consider those states with energy between lower and upper bands which are centered at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ twoband](a ) . thus ,",
    "equipotential loops are @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the lower and upper lbs , respectively . using the semiclassical theory described in the previous paragraphs",
    ", states from the upper band should move along equipotential loops around potential valleys while those from the lower band around potential peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ twoband](b ) .",
    "the loops for the upper band drift in clockwise direction , and those for the lower band in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "these two sets of loops are thus spatially separated and have _",
    "opposite chirality_. if we assume that the peaks and valleys of random potential form two coupled square lattices , the loops can be arranged as shown in fig . [ network](a ) , where _ p _ and _ v _ denote peaks and valleys , respectively . in the absence of interband",
    "mixing , the model is reduced to two decoupled single - band models and all electronic states between the two lbs are localized .",
    "if we introduce interband mixing , the localized loops may become less localized . to see that this indeed occurs , let us consider an extreme case with no tunnelings at saddle points , but with such strong interband mixing that an electron will move from a loop around a valley to its neighboring loop around a peak and vice versa , as shown by @xmath36 in fig . [",
    "network](a ) .",
    "follow an electron starting at a , its trajectory will be @xmath37 .",
    "the electron is no longer confined on a closed loop , but is now delocalized !    in the one - band model",
    ", an electron can also hop from one loop to its neighboring loops by quantum tunnelings . at a first glance",
    ", this effect seems similar to that of interband - mixing .",
    "however , they are fundamentally different . in the one - band model , electronic states for a given @xmath15",
    "are of _ the same chirality_. thus the drifting direction of an electron will be inverted when it tunnels into neighboring loops .",
    "this means that strong tunnelings in a one - band model will induce an effective backward - scattering which also localizes the electrons .",
    "we can understand this by considering a small part of the one - band model as shown in fig . [",
    "1channel](a ) where all loops are moving in clockwise direction . without tunneling , the trajectory of an electron starting from point a is @xmath38 , a clockwise closed loop . with strong tunnelings",
    ", the trajectory will tend to be @xmath39 , a counter - clockwise closed loop .",
    "thus , the tunnelings between loops of the same chirality can not delocalize states .",
    "it is worthwhile to explain why we consider only those states between two lb centers . for states outside this range",
    ", both sets of loops are localized around either valleys or peaks .",
    "this means that interband mixing mainly occurs between two loops localized around the same position , and this mixing will not delocalize a state .",
    "in fact , as explained in the previous paragraph , the mixing of the same chirality does not help delocalize an electron .",
    "this is why we shall consider mixing between spatially separated states with opposite chirality .",
    "of course , it does not mean that the mixing of the same chirality has no effect at all .",
    "as it was found in some previous works@xcite , this kind of mixing may shift an extended state from its lb center . level shifting due to mixing between states of the same chirality may distort the shape of the phase diagram , but should not alter its topology .",
    "the emergence of the bands of extended states is exclusively due to the mixing between states of opposite chirality .",
    "now , we describe our two - channel network model in detail .",
    "assume that tunnelings of two neighboring localized states ( loops ) of the same band occur around saddle points , and interband mixing takes place only on the links , fig .",

    "the other ( dashed line ) is from the upper lb moving around a potential valley .",

    "in conclusion , we find by numerical calculations within the network model that the single extended state at each lb center in the absence of interband mixing broadens into a narrow band of extended states when the effect of mixing of states of _ opposite chirality _ is taken into account . with the decrease of magnetic field or increase of disorders , these extended bands further broaden and may merge together . based on this , we propose a new phase diagram in which a narrow metallic phase exists between two neighboring iqhe phases and between an iqhe phase and an insulating phase .",

    "<S> the effect of inter - landau - band mixing on electron localization in an integer quantum hall system is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mixing of localized states with _ opposite chirality _ tends to delocalize the states . </S>",
    "<S> this delocalization effect survives the quantum treatment . </S>",
    "<S> extended states form bands because of this mixing , as we show through a numerical calculation on a two - channel network model . </S>",
    "<S> based on this result , we propose a new phase diagram with a narrow _ metallic _ phase that separates any neighboring qh phases from each other and also separates each of them from the insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyzed the data from recent non - scaling experiments , and show that they are _ consistent _ with our theory . </S>"
