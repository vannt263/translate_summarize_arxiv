    "here we are unable to give a definite answer to the question of why the loop lengths of multi - loop x - class flares derived using the r97 approach can be comparable to the observed loop lengths , considering that the application of the single - loop approach to multi - loop flares is a priori incorrect",

    "@xmath212 diagram is @xmath214 , indicating that heating is the dominant process in the decay phase of a flare (  [ sec_single_vs_multiple ] ) .",
    "second , the effect of time delay between temperature and emission measure peaks is clearly observed in all 5 multi - loop x - class flares ( figure  [ fig_solar_flares ] ) .",
    "this confirms the general expectation that the effect ( described in  [ sec_trs ] ) is applicable to a multi - loop flare case as well as to a single loop . in a multi - loop case",
    "the effect can be explained by the principle of linear superposition of flares from individual loops to produce a flare for a complete event ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "below we apply the principle of superposition to the bastille day flare .    if individual loops in a flaring loop system are ignited nearly simultaneously and _",
    "are subject to a similar evolution , which is rather a quite rare condition , _ ( or a single loop dominates the flare x - ray emission ) , then for the complete event , according to the superposition principle , the flare temperature profile ( including its peak plasma temperature ) , the flare light curve shape ( specifically the e - folding decay timescale ) , and the slope @xmath107 on the @xmath211    @xmath212 diagram should be similar to those of individual loops . in such case , for the complete event the equation of r97 would yield loop length similar to those of individual loops ( or a single dominant loop ) .",
    "is this the case for the 5 solar x - class flares studied here ?",
    "at least for the best studied case , the bastille day flare , we are unable to collect strong evidences in support of such a picture .",
    "the plasma temperature profile of the bastille day event ( figure [ fig_solar_flares ] ) has a major peak ( near 10:18:20  ut ) and two bumps seen along the rise ( near 10:10:00  ut ) and the decay ( near 10:28:20  ut ) phases of the profile , respectively .",
    "the classic time delay from temperature to emission measure is seen at the major peak ( @xmath259  seconds ) and decay - phase bump ( @xmath260  seconds ) . according to the trace images ( figure 7 in * ? ? ? * ) and the movie , the rise - phase temperature bump is likely related to the appearance of several euv loops at the westernmost edge of the arcade ( near 10:10:00  ut ) , the major temperature / emission measure peaks are associated with @xmath261 euv loops @xcite that start appearing at about 10:14:00  ut ( and last up to 11:00:00  ut ) , and the later temperature / emission measure bumps are likely related to numerous loops at the eastern part of the arcade that produce weaker flares appearing around 10:38:00  ut .    using the principle of superposition , we simulate profiles of the complete event as @xmath262 and @xmath263 where the summation is over the 20 euv loops associated with the major peak . here",
    "we assume that the @xmath264 and @xmath265 profiles for individual loop events have shapes similar to the profiles of the observed complete event ( figure [ fig_solar_flares ] ) .",
    "this simplistic simulation shows that if the loops fire nearly simultaneously ( within the time period less than the observed @xmath266 peak delay of 340  seconds , or even more precisely less than 2 minute period ) , then the temperature profile ( both the shape and the peak ) , the shape of the emission measure profile , as well as the @xmath266 peak delay of the complete event look similar to those of individual loop events . otherwise , for a complete event the simulation predicts broader shapes of the temperature and emission measure profiles and longer @xmath266 peak delay than those of individual loop events , e.g. , the delay becomes twice longer ,",
    "if the loops fire sequentially ( and evenly spaced in time ) within the 10 minute time period .",
    "thus , the ignition of 20 loops ( that are subject to a similar evolution ) within the 2 minute time period might mimic a single dominant loop .",
    "notice , however , that in our analysis we make an assumption that the profiles for individual loop events have shapes similar to the observed profiles of the complete event .",
    "many other solutions must exist .",
    "for example , using the principle of superposition @xcite show that individual loop events not firing near - simultaneously , with temperature and emission measure profiles much shorter than for the complete event , can produce the observed profiles of the complete event .",
    "one might also argue that euv images might not provide a true picture of an x - ray flare event .",
    "the x - ray band yohkoh / sxt image of the bastille day flare corresponding to the major euv peak ( figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows a single bright feature ( spanning @xmath267 square arcseconds ) within the more extended weaker emission , which may be evidence that a few localized euv - like loops dominate the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , since only a single instant x - ray image ( figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is available , it is unclear how the x - ray emission evolves spatially during the early phase of the flare .    assuming the presence of a dominant x - ray emitting structure ( a single loop or multiple similar loops firing simultaneosly ) during the bastille day flare we can apply the r97 approach strictly to the initial decay segment of the x - ray light curve @xcite .",
    "the slope of the initial decay ( prior to the bump at the late decay phase ) on the @xmath211    @xmath212 diagram is @xmath268 , much steeper than the @xmath269 obtained for the entire decay phase of the light curve , leading to an unrealistically large loop size of 200,000  km , which is a factor of 10 larger than the loop lengths measured directly from the euv images . considering the above , it seems to us that there is no clear evidence in support of a dominant x - ray emitting structure in the bastille day flare .",
