    "we assumed solar metallicity , a salpeter imf and a calzetti reddening law .",
    "we used the publicly available hyperz stellar population fitting code @xcite and let it choose from three star formation histories : a single stellar population ( ssp ) without dust , a constant star formation ( csf ) history and an exponentially declining star formation history with a characteristic timescale of 300 myr ( @xmath43 ) , the latter two with varying amounts of dust . to facilitate comparison with other studies , the derived masses were subsequently converted to a kroupa imf by subtracting a factor of 0.2 dex .",
    "we calculated rest - frame luminosities and colors by interpolating between observed bands using the best - fit templates as a guide ( see @xcite for a detailed description of this approach ) .      to determine the mass limit to which we are complete , we take detected sources with @xmath44 and scale them down in mass to the flux detection limit ( @xmath24$}}+ { \\hbox{$[4.5\\mu\\mathrm{m}]$}})/2 = 21.2 $ ] ) .",

    "this would mean that some of the galaxies we call star forming could in fact be quiescent galaxies hosting an obscured agn .",
    "if this is the case , our fraction underestimates the real fraction .",

    "another effect is the error in the photometric redshifts , which we could have undervalued .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of mid - infrared ( ir ) selected galaxies in the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) . </S>",

    "<S> this unique multi - wavelength data set allows us to investigate the sfr history of massive galaxies out to redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine star formation rates using both the rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity from young , hot stars and the total ir luminosity of obscured star formation obtained from the mips @xmath1 flux . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at all redshifts the galaxies with higher masses have substantially lower specific star formation rates than lower mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the average specific star formation rates increase with redshift , and the rate of incline is similar for all galaxies ( roughly @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> . it does not seem to be a strong function of galaxy mass . using a subsample of galaxies with masses </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , we measured the fraction of galaxies whose star formation is quenched . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a galaxy to be in quiescent mode when its specific star formation rate does not exceed @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of quiescent galaxies defined as such decreases with redshift out to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , at that redshift , @xmath6 of the @xmath3 sources would be considered quiescent according to our criterion . </S>"
