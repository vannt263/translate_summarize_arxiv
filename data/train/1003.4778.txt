    "this paper is devoted to recover a `` nonnegative '' decision variable from an underdetermined system of linear equations .",
    "when the decision variable is a vector , `` nonnegativity '' means each entry is nonnegative .",
    "when the decision variable is a matrix , `` nonnegativity '' indicates that the matrix is positive semidefinite .",
    "the problem is ill - conditioned in general , however , we can correctly recover the vector or the matrix if the vector is sparse , or the matrix is low rank .    finding the sparest vector among vectors satisfying a set of linear equations is np - hard .",
    "one frequently used heuristic is _ @xmath2-minimization _ , which returns the vector with the least @xmath2 norm .",
    "recently , there has been an explosion of research on this topic , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives a sufficient condition known as restricted isometry property ( rip ) on the measurement matrix that guarantees the recovery of the sparest vector via @xmath2 minimization .",
    "in many interesting cases , the vector is known to be nonnegative .",
    "@xcite gives a necessary and sufficient condition known as the outwardly neighborliness property of the measurement matrix for @xmath2 minimization to successfully recover a sparse non - negative vector .",
    "moreover , recent studies @xcite suggested that a sparse solution could be the unique nonnegative solution there .",
    "this certainly leads to potentially better alternatives to @xmath2 minimization as in this case any optimization problem over this constraint set can recover the solution .",
    "motivated by networking inference problems such as network tomography , we are particularly interested in systems where the measurement matrix is a 0 - 1 matrix .",
    "there have not been many existing results on this type of systems except a few very recent papers @xcite .",
    "we focus on two types of binary matrices , bernoulli 0 - 1 matrices and adjacency matrices of expanders , and provides conditions under which a sparse vector is the unique nonnegative solution to the underdetermined system . for random bernoulli measurement matrices ,",
    "we prove that , as long as the number of equations divided by the number of variables remains constant as the problem dimension grows , with overwhelming probability over the choices of matrices , a sparse nonnegative vector is a unique nonnegative solution provided that its support size is at most proportional to its dimension for some positive ratio . for general expander matrices ,",
    "we further provide a closed - form constant ratio of support size to dimension under which a nonnegative vector is the unique solution .",
    "the phenomenon that an underdetermined system admits a unique `` nonnegative '' solution is not restricted for the vector case .",
    "finding the minimum rank matrix among all matrices satisfying given linear equations is a _",
    "rank minimization _ problem . among the rank minimization problems , one particularly important class is the rank minimization problem for positive semidefinite matrices under compressed observations .",
    "for example , minimizing the rank of a covariance matrix , which is a positive semidefinite matrix , arises in statistics , econometrics , signal processing and many other fields where second - order statistics for random processes are used @xcite .",
    "a positive semidefinite matrix is special in that its eigenvalues ( also its singular values ) are nonnegative .",
    "in fact , the nuclear norm minimization heuristic for general matrices was preceded by the trace norm heuristic for positive symmetric matrices in rank minimization problems .",
    "while the general analytic frameworks and computational techniques , for example , @xcite , are applicable to the rank minimization problems for positive semidefinite matrices , the special properties of positive semidefinite matrices may open the way to new structures and new analysis , which more efficient computational techniques may exploit to provide faster matrix recovery .",
    "parallel to the influence of the nonnegative constraint on a vector variable , the positive semidefinite constraint on a matrix variable may dramatically reduce the size of the feasible set in rank minimization problems .",
    "in particular , we show that under a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear compressed observations operator , there will be a unique positive semidefinite matrix solution to compressed linear observations .",
    "we further show that a randomly generated gaussian linear compressed observations operator will satisfy this necessary and sufficient condition with overwhelmingly high probability .",
    "this result is akin to the one in the vector case for the unique nonnegative solution , but the transition from a nonnegative vector to a positive semidefinite matrix requires very different analytical approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : vector ] discusses the phenomena that a sparse vector can be the unique nonnegative vector satisfying an underdetermined linear system . focusing on 0 - 1 matrices",
    ", we prove that a sparse vector is a unique nonnegative solution as long as its support size is at most proportional to the dimension for some positive ratio .",
    "we further give a closed - form ratio of the support size and the dimension if the matrix is an adjacent matrix of an expander graph .",
    "section [ sec : matrix ] shows a low - rank matrix can be the unique positive semidefinite matrix satisfying compressed linear measurements .",
    "we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this phenomenon to happen and prove the existence of compressed measurements satisfying the proposed condition .",

    "necessity : we need to show that if there exists a nontrivial symmetric matrix ( say @xmath241 ) , with its upper triangular part from the null space of the linear operator @xmath231 , has at most @xmath247 negative eigenvalues , then we can find an @xmath223 such that @xmath266 is not a singleton .",
    "indeed , since @xmath241 is a symmetric matrix , it can be diagonalized by some unitary matrix @xmath267 , namely @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath270 .",
    "we then pick @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is a diagonal matrix , and @xmath273 for @xmath274 and @xmath275 for @xmath276 .",
    "thus @xmath223 is a positive semidefinite matrix with rank no larger than @xmath247 ( note that the eigenvalues of @xmath272 are not necessarily arranged in nondecreasing order with respect to @xmath162 ) .",
    "then obviously @xmath277 , where the diagonal entries in the diagonal matrix @xmath278 are all nonnegative .",

    "theorem [ thm : iff ] establishes the necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of low - rank positive semidefinite solution under compressed linear measurements .",
    "however , checking this condition for a specific set of linear measurements seems to be a hard problem and , in addition , it is not clear whether asymptotically there exist such linear compressed measurements satisfying the given condition .",
    "so in section [ sec : null ] , we will investigate whether a set of linear measurements ( namely the linear measurement @xmath280 ) sampled from a certain distribution will satisfy this condition .",
    "we say that the linear operator @xmath248 is sampled from an independent gaussian ensemble if its @xmath162-th ( @xmath281 ) operation , denoted by @xmath282 , is the inner product @xmath283 where @xmath284 is an @xmath224 symmetric matrix with independent random elements in its upper triangular part . on the diagonal of @xmath284 ,",

    "are also sampled independently .",
    "one main result of this paper can be stated in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : existence2 ] consider a linear operator @xmath248 sampled from an independent gaussian ensemble .",
    "let @xmath287 . then there exists a constant @xmath288 , independent of @xmath1 , such that with overwhelming probability as @xmath1 goes to @xmath289 , any nonzero symmetric @xmath224 square matrix with its upper triangular part from the null space of the linear operator @xmath231 has at least @xmath290 negative eigenvalues , where @xmath291 is a constant that is independent of @xmath1 . thus with overwhelmingly high probability , any positive semidefinite matrix of rank no larger than @xmath292 will be the singleton in the set @xmath250 .",
    "note that in theorem [ thm : existence2 ] , the constant @xmath293 may depend on @xmath294 .",
    "theorem [ thm : existence2 ] confirms that there indeed exists a sequence of linear operators such that _ every _ nonzero element in their null spaces necessarily generates a symmetric matrix having a sufficiently large number ( @xmath290 ) of negative eigenvalues .",
    "the `` guaranteed '' number of negative eigenvalues is highly nontrivial in the sense that @xmath290 grows proportionally with @xmath1 while the null space for the linear operator @xmath231 has dimension at least @xmath295 , which grows proportionally with @xmath296 .",
    "this seems counterintuitive at first sight : a null space of such a large dimension should have been able to accommodate at least one point which generates a symmetric matrix with very few or even none negative eigenvalues .    the main difficulty in proving theorem [ thm : existence2 ] is to show that for _ all _ the nonzero symmetric matrices generated from the points in the null space of the random linear operator @xmath231 , the claimed fact holds _ universally _ with overwhelming probability .",
    "this seems to be a daunting job since the null space of every linear operator is a continuous object and there are uncountably many symmetric matrices that can be generated from it .",
    "in fact , we have the following probabilistic characterization with a shortened proof for the null space of the linear operator sampled from the independent gaussian ensemble .    if the linear operator @xmath297 is sampled from independent gaussian ensemble , by representing the vectors from the null space of @xmath239 by @xmath298 column vectors , the distribution of its null space is ( almost everywhere ) equivalent to the distribution of a @xmath299-dimensional subspace in @xmath240",
    "whose basis can be represented by a @xmath300 matrix @xmath301 whose elements are independent gaussian random variables , @xmath285 for elements in the rows corresponding to the @xmath1 diagonal elements of @xmath223 and @xmath286 for elements in the rows corresponding to the @xmath302 off - diagonal elements .

    "lem : nulldist ]    this lemma follows from the fact that a random matrix with zero mean i.i.d .",
    "gaussian distributed entries generates a random subspace whose distribution is rotationally invariant ( namely the distribution of that random subspace does not change when it is rotated by a unitary rotation ) .",
    "we also note that if a random subspace has a rotationally invariant distribution , its null space also has a rotationally invariant distribution , which again can be generated by a matrix with zero mean i.i.d .",

    "we should first notice that in order to prove the property that `` any nonzero symmetric @xmath224 square matrix with its upper triangular part from the null space of the linear operator @xmath231 has at least @xmath290 negative eigenvalue '' , we only need to restrict our attention to prove that property for the set of symmetric matrices generated by the set of points @xmath304 in the null space of the linear operator @xmath231 .",
    "building on this observation , we can proceed to divide the formal proof of theorem [ thm : existence2 ] into three steps .",
    "firstly , since we can not show directly our theorem for every point in the null space , instead we first try to discretize the sphere @xmath305 into a finite @xmath306-net consisting of a finite number of points on the sphere such that every point in the set @xmath307 is in the @xmath306 ( in terms of euclidean distance ) neighborhood of at least one point from the @xmath306-net .",
    "formally , an @xmath306-net is a subset @xmath308 such that for every point @xmath309 in the set @xmath310 , one can find @xmath311 in @xmath312 such that @xmath313 .",
    "the following lemma is well known in high dimensional geometry about the size estimate of such a @xmath306-net , for example , see @xcite :    there is an @xmath306-net @xmath312 of the unit sphere of @xmath314 of cardinality less than @xmath315 , which is no larger than @xmath316 .",
    "secondly , using the large deviation technique or concentration of measure result , we establish the relevant properties for the symmetric matrices generated from these discrete points on the @xmath306-net .",
    "for example , the symmetric matrices have a large number of negative eigenvalues with overwhelming probability .",
    "thirdly , we show how property guarantees on the @xmath306-net can be used to establish the null space property for the whole null space of the linear operator @xmath231 .",
    "section [ sec : single ] and [ sec : netanalysis ] are then devoted to completing these steps to prove theorem [ thm : existence2 ] .",
    "we take any point @xmath64 from the @xmath306-net for the set @xmath310 and its corresponding point @xmath317 in the null space of the linear operator @xmath231 , where @xmath301 is the random basis as mentioned in lemma [ lem : nulldist ] .",
    "then we argue that the symmetric matrix @xmath318 with its upper triangular part generated from @xmath319 has many negative eigenvalues with overwhelming probability .",
    "it is obvious that with the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian probabilistic model for @xmath301 , the elements of @xmath318 are independently gaussian distributed @xmath320 random variables on the diagonal and independently gaussian distributed @xmath321 on the off - diagonal .",
    "the smallest @xmath322 ( @xmath323 ) eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath318 with its upper triangular part generated from @xmath319 will be upper bounded by @xmath324 with overwhelming probability @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is a negative number as determined from the semicircular law @xmath327 @xmath328 is an arbitrarily small positive number , @xmath329 is a positive constant independent of @xmath1 and @xmath330 is the indicator function .",
    "[ thm : eigenconcen ]    indeed theorem [ thm : eigenconcen ] can be derived from known large deviations or concentration of measure results for the empirical eigenvalue distribution of random symmetric gaussian matrix @xcite @xcite . obviously , @xmath318 has @xmath1 real eigenvalues @xmath331 arranged in nondecreasing order and its spectral measure @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the delta function .",
    "as in @xcite , we denote the space of probability measure on @xmath334 as @xmath335 and will endow @xmath335 with its usual weak topology .",
