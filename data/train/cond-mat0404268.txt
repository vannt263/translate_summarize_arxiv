    "the persistence of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) short - range order in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase of the manganites has been recognized for many years @xcite . in metallic manganites like la@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 that contain a preponderance of afm - coupled polaronic regions @xcite ,",
    "the curie temperature @xmath12 is suppressed but the magnetoresistance is strongly enhanced .",
    "close to but below @xmath13 , the spin dynamics of la@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 contains both a propagating spin - wave ( sw ) branch from the fm regions and a diffusive component from polaronic regions with suppressed fm interactions @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature insulating phase of the manganite pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 with @xmath9 was originally believed @xcite to be a canted afm ( caf ) but may actually contain regions with both fm and afm short - range order @xcite . when an applied field @xmath5 exceeds about 3 t , the resistivity drops by several orders of magnitude @xcite , the afm regions shrink @xcite , and the sw stiffness @xmath14 jumps by a factor of 3 @xcite . despite the central role played by afm interactions in the manganites , little is known theoretically about how they affect the propagating sw dynamics . as first shown by anderson and hasegawa @xcite ,",
    "the effective electron - hopping energy between two local moments making a relative angle @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath16 in the limit of large hund s coupling .",
    "so afm interactions may suppress the contribution of electron - mediated double - exchange ( de ) to the sw dynamics @xcite . by aligning the local moments , a magnetic field or electron",
    "hopping will alter the de contribution to the sw dynamics .",
    "this paper examines the effects of afm interactions on the ground - state properties and sw dynamics of electrons coupled to the local moments of a generalized villain model @xcite .",
    "the generalized villain model is one of the simplest periodic models to exhibit magnetic frustration . as described in fig.1(a ) , the local moments @xmath17 are coupled by the fm interaction @xmath0 along the @xmath18 direction and by either the fm interaction @xmath0 or the afm interaction @xmath1 along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the caf phase is stable when @xmath3 exceeds the critical value @xmath20 , which is @xmath21 when @xmath22 but increases as @xmath5 increases .",
    "due to the different environments of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 sites , the angle @xmath25 at the @xmath24 sites is always larger than @xmath26 at the @xmath23 sites , as shown in fig.1(b ) .     or @xmath1 ,",
    "( b ) the local moments in the @xmath27 plane subtend angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the @xmath30 axis , and ( c ) the electron spins also lie in the @xmath27 plane but subtend angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the @xmath30 axis . ]    in the hybrid model considered here , the heisenberg interactions between the local moments are in the villain configuration while electrons with density @xmath33 are fm coupled to the local moments by hund s coupling @xmath34 and hop between neighboring sites with energy @xmath4 .",
    "the dev model ( so called because it combines the de and villain models ) provides several advantages as a basis for understanding the effects of afm interactions and non - collinearity on the spin dynamics .",
    "first , except in a narrow range of parameters , a homogeneous caf phase is stable against phase separation when the afm control parameter @xmath3 exceeds @xmath20 .",
    "by contrast , the well - studied hybrid model with afm interactions @xmath35 between all neighboring local moments phase separates _ before _ the afm exchange @xmath0 is large enough to ca nt the spins @xcite .",
    "this phase instability is caused by a `` site - local continuous degeneracy '' @xcite that is absent in the dev model .",
    "second , unlike the case in a hybrid model with afm exchange only , the ground state of the dev model contains a fm component even when @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "so it can be used to evaluate the change in sw stiffness @xmath14 as the electrons become mobile .",
    "third , because the dev model contains both fm and afm heisenberg interactions , it can be used to study insulating manganites like pr@xmath38ca@xmath39mno@xmath8 , where the afm interactions are produced by superexchange and the fm interactions by short - ranged orbital order @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have constructed a model that is translationally symmetric in two dimensions . since this model",
    "is solved at zero temperature , the qualitative results will be unchanged in three dimensions .",
    "more problematically , the afm interactions are arranged periodically rather than in clusters . in the low - temperature phase of pr@xmath40ca@xmath41mno@xmath8",
    ", the fm interactions may be confined to two - dimensional sheets with widths of roughly @xmath42 in a `` red cabbage '' structure @xcite .",
    "neutron - scattering results @xcite , on the other hand , suggest that the fm clusters in the insulating phase are about @xmath43 is diameter .",
    "so for wavelengths much longer than @xmath43 , the sw s will average over the fm and afm regions .",
    "hence , the dev model will provide qualitatively accurate predictions for the average sw stiffness @xmath44 defined in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dev model is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the creation and destruction operators for an electron with spin @xmath48 at site @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the electronic spin , and @xmath17 is the spin of the local moment with magnitude @xmath51 .",
    "nearest - neighbor heisenberg interactions @xmath52 take the values @xmath0 ( fm interaction ) or @xmath1 ( afm interaction ) , as described in fig.1(a ) .",
    "this model is solved at zero temperature by expanding the hamiltonian in powers of @xmath2 . to guarantee that the contributions to the sw frequencies from hopping and from the heisenberg interactions are of the same order in @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath4 is considered to be of the same order in @xmath2 as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "hence , the dimensionless parameters of our model are @xmath56 , @xmath3 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath59 , the magnetic field @xmath5 only couples to the local moments and not to the electrons .",
    "while the theory developed below can be extended to treat all values of the hund s coupling , we shall for simplicity consider the limit of large @xmath53 or in dimensionless terms , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this paper is divided into five sections .",

    "this section presents , for the first time , a holstein - primakoff expansion for the generalized villain model . in an equivalent approach , saslow and",
    "erwin @xcite numerically evaluated the mode frequencies by linearizing the equations of motion for the spins .",
    "however , a formal holstein - primakoff expansion is required to lay the foundation for the solution of the full dev model in section iv .",
    "the hamiltonian of the generalized villain model is given by eq.([ham ] ) with @xmath36 and @xmath62 .",

    ", the sw stiffnesses in the @xmath19 and @xmath18 directions are obtained from the expression @xmath104 .    in the fm phase",

    "the sw stiffnesses in the fm phase are given by the simple results @xmath108 and @xmath109 , independent of field .",
    "the fm phase becomes unstable when @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the afm bragg vector .",
    "this yields the same condition for the caf - fm phase boundary as eq.([pb0 ] ) .    in the caf phase ,",
    "analytic results for the sw stiffnesses were found only when @xmath37 : @xmath112 @xmath113 when @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . for @xmath117",
    ", @xmath118 tends to a nonzero limit but @xmath119 still diverges as @xmath114 .",

    "above @xmath122 , the stiffnesses are independent of field .",
    "but in the caf phase below @xmath122 , the dependence on field is more complex . for @xmath123 , @xmath124 at zero field and the stiffnesses cross as the field increases .",
    "if the sw stiffness in the @xmath48 direction is defined at fixed @xmath125 by @xmath126 , then @xmath127 increases rapidly near the field @xmath128 as shown in the inset to fig.3(b ) for @xmath85 . as discussed in detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite , this behavior is typical of any caf with a quadratic sw dispersion .",

    "the fraction @xmath203 of such electrons is plotted in figs.(6 - 8 ) . for @xmath197 and @xmath37 in fig.6(a ) , @xmath196 has a maximum of 0.574 as @xmath204 and approaches 1/2 as @xmath205 .",
    "similar behavior is found in figs.7(a ) and 8(a ) , where @xmath196 is shown to be an increasing function of @xmath3 and a decreasing function of @xmath74 .",
    "this behavior is easy to understand : the largest angles between neighboring spins are along the @xmath19 axis between @xmath24 sites with angles differing by @xmath206 .",
    "when an electron hops onto a @xmath24 site , it can not easily hop to other @xmath24 sites and so quickly moves onto a neighboring @xmath23 site , where it can readily travel between other @xmath23 sites with angular difference @xmath207 .",

    "so even when the electrons are unable to hop between sites on the @xmath24 sublattice ( since the angles on neighboring @xmath24 sites differ by @xmath139 ) , roughly 40% of the electrons can still be found on @xmath24 sites at any one time . because neither the caf nor fm densities - of - states contain a gap , both phases are metallic within the dev model for @xmath210 .",
    "due to short - range orbital ordering , a cdw with the same period as the one predicted here has in fact been observed in the afm regions of pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "hence , the average sw stiffness drops from roughly @xmath310 at @xmath37 to @xmath311 at @xmath122 . because a magnetic field very quickly destroys the region of phase separation , the crossing point of the @xmath19 and @xmath18 stiffnesses",

    "when @xmath84 , the critical values of the dev model are @xmath319 in zero field and @xmath320 for @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the metallic value for the hopping energy is more than sufficient to stabilize the fm phase but an applied field of 3 t can not align the local moments when @xmath186 is much below @xmath289 .",
    "metal - insulator transitions in many of the manganites have been successfully interpreted within the framework of percolation theory @xcite .",
    "when the fm fraction @xmath321 exceeds a critical value @xmath322 , a fm backbone spans the sample and the system becomes metallic .",
    "the percolation threshold @xmath322 in those manganites lies between 0.17 and 0.19 .",
    "but it is rather difficult to explain the jump in the sw stiffness observed in pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 @xcite within the framework of percolation theory . assuming that the metal - insulator transition in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 is produced by the percolation of metallic fm clusters @xcite , there is no reason why the sw stiffness should change when a fm backbone spans the sample .",
    "within percolation theory , one would more naturally expect the sw stiffness to gradually increase with field as a growing fraction of the sample becomes metallic .",
    "estimates of the fm fraction @xmath321 in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 manganites also pose a difficulty for percolation theory .",
    "the accepted range for the percolation threshold @xmath322 within continuum models falls between 0.15 and 0.22 .",
    "while one experimental estimate of @xmath323 @xcite at the metal - insulator transition lies well below this accepted range , a recent estimate of @xmath324 @xcite based on more complete magnetization data lies well above this range . at zero field and low temperatures , estimates for @xmath321 range from 0.3 @xcite to 0.5 @xcite .",
    "if those estimates are correct and the fm regions are metallic , then the percolation threshold would already be exceeded and the low - temperature phase would be metallic in zero field .    on the other hand , our results clearly indicate that the jump in the sw stiffness at a field of 3 t can not be produced by simply aligning the afm regions while keeping the bandwidth @xmath325 fixed . as found in fig.8(b ) , a magnetic field would act to suppress rather than enhance the average sw stiffness under those conditions .",
    "moreover , a field of 3 t corresponding to @xmath326 will have little affect on the alignment of the local moments . whereas experiments indicate that the afm regions begin to shrink under a magnetic field greater than 3 t , a sizeable fraction of the sample remains afm even above the metal - insulator transition @xcite .    the large increase in the sw stiffness predicted by our work as @xmath186 increases from 0 to @xmath289",
    "suggests an entirely different scenario : at the critical field , electrons in the insulating and possibly canted fm regions delocalize as the hopping energy @xmath4 sharply increases .",
    "since the integrated optical weight is just @xmath327 , the jump in the hopping energy at 3 t should be observable in optical measurements .",
    "indeed , measurements by okimoto",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite on pr@xmath328ca@xmath329mno@xmath8 reveal a rapid rise in @xmath330 and a rapid drop in the cdw gap near the critical field .",
    "if the percolation threshold for the fm regions is exceeded when the electrons delocalize , as suggested by the measurements discussed above , then the jump in the sw stiffness will coincide with the metal - insulator transition .",
    "otherwise , the metal - insulator transition will occur at a slightly larger field .    supporting this picture are the plethora of probes that can produce a metal - insulator transition in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "besides a magnetic field , application of an electric field @xcite , high pressure @xcite , exposure to x - rays @xcite , and exposure to visible light @xcite all induce a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the identical resistivities produced by application of a magnetic field or exposure to x - rays @xcite suggest a common mechanism : the excitation of charge carriers out of polaronic traps produced by the electron - lattice coupling",
    ". the subsequent relaxation of the lattice @xcite may prevent retrapping of the electrons .",
    "the jump in the sw stiffness as a function of field in pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 @xcite also bares a striking resemblance to the jump in the sw stiffness observed in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 at the metal - insulator transition with @xmath331 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the sizes of the sw stiffnesses on either side of the doping - induced transition in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 are almost exactly the same as on either side of the field - induced transition in pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 .",
    "this suggests that there are also large increases in the hopping energy and electronic kinetic energy in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 at the critical concentration of @xmath332 .",
    "compare the jump in the sw stiffness across the metal - insulator transition with the smooth dependence of the spin - diffusion coefficient @xmath333 @xcite , which gives the lifetime @xmath334 of paramagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "measurements @xcite of the spin - diffusion coefficient were performed just below @xmath12 , where paramagnetic spin relaxation occurs within polaronic regions of the fm phase .",
    "while @xmath14 is a linear function of the electronic kinetic energy in the fm phase , @xmath335 depends only on doping and is independent of the electronic bandwidth @xmath336 in the low - temperature limit @xmath337 @xcite .",
    "so long as the bandwidth of the polaronic regions remains large compared to the temperature , the spin - diffusion coefficient will not change across the metal - insulator transition .",
    "except in a very narrow range of parameters , phase separation is absent in the dev model .",
    "phase separation appears quite commonly in de models with afm heisenberg interactions @xcite and even occurs near @xmath338 in a de model without heisenberg interactions @xcite .",
    "results for the dev model contrast with both a de model with afm interactions between all neighboring local moments @xcite and a de model with fm interactions in plane but afm interactions between neighboring planes @xcite . due to the high symmetry of both models ,",
    "afm order is not frustrated when @xmath36 .",
    "but in both cases , phase separation occurs before the afm interactions become strong enough to ca nt the spins .",
    "work by golosov @xcite indicates that the canted phase is destabilized by the presence of local degeneracies @xcite that are absent in the dev model .",
    "our results suggest that phase separation only occurs within a very narrow range of parameters when the afm heisenberg interactions are frustrated and local degeneracies are absent . for doping concentrations away from multiples of a quarter filling ,",
    "long - range orbital ordering is impossible and magnetic frustration may be present in a wide range of manganites .",
    "therefore , the de model may not provide as straightforward a pathway to phase separation in the manganites as believed .",
    "a much more important role may be played by the quenched disorder associated with chemical inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "romn and soto @xcite pointed out that the nature of the fm and afm regions can be probed by measuring the sw spectrum about the afm bragg vector @xmath146 . in a caf , the sw s are not gapped for any field @xmath5 below @xmath122 , as shown in figs.4 and 12 .",
    "by contrast , the sw s of a collinear afm contain a gap at @xmath339 that grows linearly with field .",
    "so measurements of the sw spectrum about @xmath146 may be used to determine whether local regions are canted . as discussed elsewhere @xcite and seen in the inset to fig.3(b ) , the rapid increase in the sw stiffness for fields near @xmath340 is another signature of a canted phase .",
    "the absence of this behavior in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 for @xmath341 strongly suggests that the local afm regions are _ not _ canted .",
    "since ce - type afm ordering occurs at half - filling , the local charge ordering observed in the manganites pr@xmath328ca@xmath329mno@xmath8 @xcite and la@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath8 @xcite would be simplified if the polaronic regions were rich in holes and poor in electrons compared to the bulk .",
    "our model provides a natural explanation for this behavior , since the electronic fraction on @xmath24 sites is substantially smaller than the fraction on @xmath23 sites as the electrons avoid regions with more pronounced afm order .",
    "this paper has studied the general effects of afm interactions and non - collinearity on the magnetic ordering and spin dynamics of de systems .",
    "the competition between de and afm interactions is responsible for several interesting properties . in a narrow region of hopping energies",
    ", weak phase separation occurs as the fs topology changes from closed to open .",
    "because electrons prefer to occupy sites that are coupled by fm interactions , a cdw appears in the absence of a cdw gap . for finite hund s coupling ,",
    "the electron spins are more closely aligned than the local moments of the caf .",
    "the caf becomes unstable above critical values of field and hopping energy and below a critical value of @xmath3 .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result is that de changes none of the qualitative features of the caf state .",
    "the sw gap @xmath342 at @xmath221 remains equal to @xmath5 and the gap @xmath343 at the afm bragg vector @xmath146 continues to vanish for any hopping energy below @xmath312 .",
    "the average sw stiffness still softens with magnetic field and hardens with strengthening afm interactions ; the sw velocity at @xmath339 still vanishes at the caf - fm transition .",
    "clearly , a great deal can be learned about the general properties of caf s , even of the more complex variations that appear in many manganites , by considering simple models such as the dev model .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful conversations with drs a chernyshev , p - c dai , e dagotto , j fernandez - baca , d golosov , m katsnelson , n furukawa , w saslow , and a zheludev .",
    "this research was sponsored by the us department of energy under contract de - ac05 - 00or22725 with oak ridge national laboratory , managed by ut - battelle , llc .",
    "in the canted phase of a two - sublattice model with afm interactions , the local moment on any site of sublattice @xmath23 must make an angle @xmath15 with the local moments on sublattice @xmath24 .",
    "so the possible orientations for any @xmath23 spin trace out a cone around the equilibrium direction of the @xmath24 spins @xcite . in the canted phase of a two - sublattice model with fm interactions in plane but afm interactions between planes , the moments in any plane @xmath23",
    "are free to rotate about the equilibrium direction of the moments on neighboring planes @xmath24 .",
    "these local or planar degeneracies are absent in the dev model .      while the fm coupling between neighboring mn@xmath212 and mn@xmath211 ions are induced by the hopping of electrons those sites , that coupling is significantly enhanced by the polaronic distortions of the o atoms around some mn@xmath212 ions @xcite .",
    "so the heisenberg coupling @xmath0 incorporates the enhancement of the fm interaction beyond that produced by the uniform hopping of electrons between neighboring sites on an undistorted lattice .",
    "since there are four inequivalent sites on the villain lattice , it might seem that the first brillouin zone should be reduced in both the @xmath19 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "however , all @xmath23 or @xmath24 sites experience the same environment regardless of whether the spins tilt to the @xmath344 or @xmath345 directions : each @xmath23 spin , for example , makes an angle of @xmath346 with its @xmath24 neighbors and an angle @xmath347 with its @xmath23 neighbors ."
