    "while many general results are known , explicit computation of @xmath17 appears difficult and is limited to a small number of sporadic examples .",
    "one reason that accounts in part for this difficulty is the fact that a map of spaces @xmath18 does not necessarily induce a corresponding homomorphism of gottlieb groups , since in general @xmath19 . in particular , attempts to study @xmath17 via a cell decomposition of @xmath5 are frustrated , since it is not clear what effect a cell attachment may have on the gottlieb groups .",
    "one tool for studying @xmath17 that attempts to circumvent this problem is the so - called _ @xmath8-sequence of a map _ , introduced by woo and lee in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-sequence of a map @xmath9 is a sequence @xmath20 of groups and homomorphisms that derives from the long exact homotopy sequence of the map @xmath4 . in this sequence",
    ", @xmath21 is the gottlieb group of @xmath5 , @xmath22 is the evaluation subgroup of @xmath4 introduced above , and the third term @xmath23 is a suitably defined  relative \" term .",
    "the @xmath8-sequence arises as follows .",
    "one has the following commutative diagram of spaces : @xmath24^{f _ * } \\ar[d]_{\\omega } & \\map(x , y ; f)\\ar[d]^{\\omega}\\\\ x \\ar[r]_{f } & y}\\ ] ] now pass to the corresponding induced homomorphisms of homotopy groups . in a standard way , the induced homomorphisms of homotopy groups @xmath25 and",

    "then the evaluation maps induce maps of each term in the long exact sequences , resulting in a homotopy ladder .",
    "the @xmath8-sequence of the map @xmath4 is then the image of the top long exact homotopy sequence in that of the bottom .",
    "a portion of the @xmath8-sequence is shown here : @xmath28    \\ar@{->>}[d]^{\\omega_{\\ # } } & \\pi_{n}(\\map(x , x;1 ) ) \\ar@{->>}[d]^{\\omega_{\\ # } }    \\ar[r]^{(f_*)_{\\ # } }    & \\pi_{n}(\\map(x , y;f ) )    \\ar@{->>}[d]^{\\omega_{\\ # } }      \\\\",

    "some general conditions are known under which the @xmath8-sequence is exact ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but in general it is not exact ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we bring the techniques of rational homotopy theory to bear on problems and questions concerning evaluation subgroups ( of a map ) in general , and the @xmath8-sequence in particular .",
    "our main goal is to expand the range of application of these techniques in this area . to this end",
    ", we are primarily concerned with establishing a suitable framework for considering such questions . at the same time",
    ", we obtain a number of results of interest in their own right .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : our main results are established in sections @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the basic result in section  [ sec : deriv spaces ] is theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] , in which we identify the map induced on rational homotopy groups by the evaluation map @xmath31 .",
    "we describe this induced homomorphism as the map induced on homology by a map of complexes of derivations of the sullivan minimal models of @xmath5 and @xmath32 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] has a number of immediate corollaries .",
    "for instance , we obtain a characterization of the rationalized evaluation subgroups of a map ( corollary  [ cor : rational eval subgp of f ] ) that extends a well known characterization , due to flix and halperin , of the ( rationalized ) gottlieb groups of a space in terms of derivations of its minimal model .    in section  [ sec : long exact sequences ] , we extend and amplify the basic result of theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] .",
    "we show that several related long exact sequences of rational homotopy groups are naturally expressed as long exact sequences in homology of derivation complexes of sullivan minimal models .",
    "in particular , we obtain a description , within the framework of derivation spaces , of the @xmath8-sequence of a map after rationalization .",
    "the results of this section are of interest in their own right and in several cases ( e.g.  theorem  [ thm : long exact seq of eval fib ] ) they are independent of the @xmath8-sequence .    in section  [ sec : examples ] , we use the framework established in sections @xmath29 and @xmath30 to study questions concerning the rationalized @xmath8-sequence . just as in the integral setting , the rationalized @xmath8-sequence is not exact in general .",
    "example  [ ex : non - exact g - seq ] gives a simple example for which the rationalized @xmath8-sequence fails to be exact at each of the three types of term that occur .",
    "since non - exactness rationally implies non - exactness integrally , this example provides a new , complete example of the failure of exactness of the @xmath8-sequence .",
    "this example also shows that the framework established in sections @xmath29 and @xmath30 provides an effective setting in which to carry out explicit computations . by way of contrast , in theorem  [ thm : exact g - seq ] we give one set of conditions under which the rationalized @xmath8-sequence is exact . in theorem",
    "[ thm : h^omega=0 ] we show that under certain circumstances , the rationalized @xmath8-sequence may be exact at all occurrences of one type of term , while failing to be exact at the other types of term .",
    "this same result establishes a relationship , albeit under rather restrictive circumstances , between the ( vanishing of a certain type of the ) @xmath33-homology of a map @xmath34 and the ( vanishing of ) negative - degree derivations of the rational cohomology of @xmath5 .",
    "the last development that we present in section  [ sec : examples ] is a connection between the @xmath8-sequence of certain fibre inclusion maps and a well - known conjecture in rational homotopy theory .",
    "let @xmath35 be a fibration with base an odd - dimensional sphere",
    ". for certain types of fibre space @xmath5 , a conjecture of halperin asserts that the fibration should be rationally tncz ( see conjecture  [ conj : halperin ] below ) . in theorem",
    "[ thm : halperin g - trivial ] , we show that this is the case exactly when the rationalized @xmath8-sequence of the fibre inclusion @xmath36 reduces to a certain short exact sequence . in this way",
    ", we obtain an equivalent phrasing of the conjecture of halperin , in terms of the ideas studied in this paper .    finally ,",
    "in a technical appendix , we give full details for several results from rational homotopy theory used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] .",
    "we next discuss existing results on rational homotopy , function spaces , and the gottlieb groups of a space that relate to this paper .",
    "our aim in this discussion is to indicate the basic results that exist in the area . at the same time",
    ", we identify how these results relate to our work , and our points of departure from them . from results in rational homotopy theory",
    ", we can identify three ",
    "tributary streams \" that flow into this work precisely at theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares]our first main result  at varying levels of generality .",
    "there is also a fourth tributary flowing into our work , from outside rational homotopy theory , that includes the work on the @xmath8-sequence .    the first tributary of antecedent results in rational homotopy theory concerns the rationalized gottlieb groups of a space .",
    "in @xcite , flix and halperin gave a characterization of the rationalized gottlieb groups of a space , in terms of derivations of the sullivan minimal model . at its most specialized level , theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] retrieves this characterization ( corollary  [ cor : rational gottlieb group ] ) and extends it to a similar characterization of the rationalized evaluation subgroups of a general map ( corollary  [ cor : rational eval subgp of f ] ) .",
    "flix and halperin went on to prove a remarkable result concerning the rationalized gottlieb groups of a finite complex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.iii ) .",
    "their result significantly extends results of gottlieb from @xcite , and relates the rationalized gottlieb groups with the rational lusternik - schnirelmann category .",
    "unfortunately , no analogous result seems forthcoming for the rationalized evaluation subgroups of a map .",
    "nonetheless , our characterization of the rationalized evaluation subgroups of a map is as effective for concrete computations as is the earlier characterization of the rationalized gottlieb groups .",
    "the second tributary concerns the rational homotopy type of @xmath37the classifying space for fibrations with fibre @xmath5 .",
    "although we are not concerned with this classifying space as such , the connection arises because we have an isomorphism of homotopy groups @xmath38 , and also the gottlieb groups of @xmath5 are obtained as the image in homotopy groups of the connecting homomorphism of the corresponding classifying fibration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.2.6 ) . at a higher level of generality than the rationalized gottlieb groups ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] includes an identification of the map induced on rational homotopy groups by the evaluation map @xmath39 , and in particular it identifies the rational homotopy groups of @xmath40 .",
    "whilst the identification of these groups we give is familiar in rational homotopy theory , our proof for this  obtained by restricting that of theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares]is the first direct and detailed one that has actually appeared in the literature .",
    "we support this assertion as follows : in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.11 ) , sullivan sketched ( with no proof ) a model for the rational homotopy type of @xmath37 , from which the description of the rational homotopy groups of @xmath40 contained in theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] follows .",
    "a justification of sullivan s model for @xmath37 may be gleaned by collating results from a number of sources spread through the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) . but to date , no direct proof of sullivan s model has been given .",
    "even amongst those articles that focus specifically on the rational homotopy",
    "_ groups _ , either of @xmath37 or of @xmath41and that therefore avoid the technical problems of dealing with the rational homotopy _",
    "type_we still do not find complete details .",
    "meier ( * ? ? ? *",
    "( 1.4 ) , ( 2.6 ) ) outlines the basic idea , but is actually focussed on a special kind of situation in which the minimal model can be replaced by its cohomology .",
    "grivel @xcite focusses on the same special case as meier , and quotes sullivan s model directly .",
    "flix and thomas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.3 ) give exactly the description of the rational homotopy groups of @xmath40 contained in theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] , but no details of the proof are given .",
    "as well as including a direct and detailed proof for the case of @xmath40 , theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] extends this identification of the rational homotopy groups to the general case of @xmath10 .",
    "it thus provides a natural framework for the study of rational homotopy groups of function spaces .    finally , the third tributary from rational homotopy theory consists of a model , due to sullivan and haefliger , for the rational homotopy type of @xmath10 . at its full level of generality ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] identifies the map induced on rational homotopy groups by @xmath42 , a general evaluation map .",
    "the precursor to the identification we give , and to our general line of proof , is the approach of thom in @xcite , although obviously there is no reference to minimal models in his work .",
    "pursuing the river analogy a little further , we may think of thom s result , if not as the source , then at least as somewhere in the headwaters .",
    "we emphasize the connection between theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] and thom s approach by retrieving a basic result of his in corollary  [ cor : thom ] .",
    "coming further downstream , sullivan also described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.11 ) a model for the space of sections of a fibration homotopic to a given section . by specializing to the trivial fibration @xmath43 ,",
    "this yields a model for the function space @xmath10and more generally a model for the rational homotopy _ type _ of the general evaluation map @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed proof for sullivan s model in this case was given by haefliger @xcite .",
    "now this model should in principle determine the rational homotopy groups of the function space ( see @xcite and @xcite , where it is used quite effectively ) . however , the model in question is a ( non - minimal ) dg algebra model .",
    "therefore , the homomorphism induced by @xmath33 on rational homotopy groups  which is exactly the information we require to proceed with our development  is available only indirectly , at best . by focussing on the rational homotopy _",
    "groups_as opposed to the rational homotopy type , we have arrived in theorem  [ thm : equivalence of squares ] at an entirely new characterization of the map induced on rational homotopy groups by @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , we have been able to give a direct proof that avoids many of the technical complexities of haefliger s work and is completely independent of it .",
    "the remaining tributary flowing into our work comes from outside rational homotopy theory , and concerns classical results on the gottlieb groups of a space , and more recent results on evaluation subgroups of a map and the @xmath8-sequence .",
    "we have already mentioned some of the results in this area . in his original work on evaluation subgroups",
    ", gottlieb observed that a map of spaces does not necessarily induce a map of gottlieb groups , and gave conditions under which it does ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.1 ) .",
    "gottlieb briefly mentions the evaluation subgroups of a map in @xcite , but did not study them as such .",
    "a number of basic properties of the evaluation subgroup of a map are established in @xcite . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "woo and lee introduced the @xmath8-sequence of a map in @xcite .",
    "results on the @xmath8-sequence basically fall into one of three areas : conditions under which the @xmath8-sequence is exact ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.12 ) and @xcite ) , examples of non - exactness ( e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) , and extensions and generalizations of evaluation subgroups and the @xmath8-sequence ( e.g.  @xcite ) . these results give the stepping - off point for our work in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "using our description of the rationalized @xmath8-sequence ( theorem  [ thm : g - seq of f ] ) , we extend the known exactness results to several new cases .",
    "we also give new instances of non - exactness .",
    "more significantly , by focussing on the rational setting , our methods make the production of such examples straightforward . on the other hand , our results and examples are not restricted to amplifying previous results in this area . in corollary",
    "[ cor : g - sequence halperin ] , we suggest a different kind of result that relates properties of the @xmath8-sequence to the triviality of a fibration . furthermore , some results in section 3including theorem  [ thm : long exact seq of f _ * ] and theorem  [ thm : long exact seq of eval fib]are of interest independently of any relation to the @xmath8-sequence .",
    "we finish this introduction by setting some notation and terminology . throughout this paper , @xmath5 and @xmath32 will denote simply connected cw complexes of finite type . by _ vector space _ we mean a rational graded vector space . by _ algebra _ , we mean the kind of commutative graded algebras over the rationals that arise in rational homotopy .",
    "that is , they are non - negatively graded , connected ( @xmath44 ) and usually simply connected ( @xmath45 ) , with cohomology of finite type . for a vector space @xmath46",
    ", we denote the free commutative graded algebra generated by @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "we use the acronym dg to denote differential graded : thus , dg vector space , dg algebra , and so - forth . for a dg algebra ,",
    "the differential is of degree @xmath48 . in other situations , however , particularly when we consider the complex of derivations of a dg algebra , the differential is of degree @xmath49 .",
    "we will generally refer to a dg vector space whose differential is of degree @xmath49 as a chain complex .",
    "if @xmath50 is a map , either topological or algebraic , then @xmath51 denotes pre - composition by @xmath4 and @xmath27 denotes post - composition by @xmath4 . in any setting in which it is appropriate , we use @xmath52 to denote the map induced on homology ( or cohomology ) by @xmath4 , and @xmath26 to denote the map induced on homotopy groups by the map of spaces @xmath4 .",
    "a map of dg algebras is called a _ quasi - isomorphism _ if it induces an isomorphism on cohomology .",
    "we use @xmath33 in a generic way to denote an evaluation map , and we denote the identity map of a topological space or the identity homomorphism of an algebra by @xmath53 .",
    "we denote the rationalization of a space @xmath5 by @xmath54 and of a map @xmath4 by @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of rational homotopy .",
    "our general reference for this material is @xcite .",
    "we recall , in particular , that a space @xmath5 has a _ minimal model _",
    "@xmath56 , which is a certain type of dg algebra .",
    "namely , @xmath56 is a free algebra @xmath47 with a decomposable differential , that is , @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , a map of spaces @xmath58 induces a map of minimal models @xmath59 .",
    "we refer to this induced map as the _ sullivan minimal model _ of the map @xmath4 .",
    "it is a complete rational homotopy invariant for a map , and in principle all rational homotopy theoretic information about @xmath4 can be retrieved from it .",
    "passing to cohomology , for example , gives @xmath60 , which corresponds to the homomorphism of rational cohomology algebras induced by @xmath4 .",
    "the results of this paper illustrate how deeper information about a space or map may be retrieved from the minimal model by making correspondingly more sophisticated constructions with the model .",
    "our purpose in this and the next section is to give a unified description in rational homotopy theory of all the terms involved in the definition of the @xmath8-sequence .",
    "informally stated , we show that the homology theory of derivation complexes of sullivan minimal models provides an algebraic model for the rational homotopy theory of function spaces at the level of homotopy groups .",
    "we focus on the following commutative square that appears in the homotopy ladder from which the @xmath8-sequence arises : @xmath61^{(f_*)_\\ # } \\ar[d]_{\\omega_\\ # } & \\pi_n\\big(\\map(x , y ; f)\\big)\\ar[d]^{\\omega_\\#}\\\\ \\pi_n(x ) \\ar[r]_{f_\\ # } & \\pi_n(y)}\\ ] ] it turns out that identifying the rationalization of this commutative square is sufficient to arrive not only at a characterization of the rationalized evaluation subgroups of @xmath4 , but also at a description of the rationalization of the @xmath8-sequence .",
    "furthermore , our identification of the rationalization of this square allows us to conclude several subsidiary results of interest .",
    "we say two maps of vector spaces @xmath62 and @xmath63 are _ equivalent _ if there exist isomorphisms @xmath64 and @xmath65 which make the diagram @xmath66^{f } \\ar[d]_{\\alpha}^{\\cong } & v \\ar[d]_{\\beta}^{\\cong}\\\\ u ' \\ar[r]_{g } & v'}\\ ] ] commutative .",
    "this notion of equivalence for vector space maps extends in the obvious way to sequences of vector space maps , commutative squares of vector space maps , and any other diagram of vector space maps .",
    "suppose a dg algebra @xmath67 is isomorphic to @xmath68 in degree zero , that is , @xmath69 .",
    "then the map @xmath70 that sends all elements of positive degree to zero , and is the identity in degree zero , is an augmentation",
    ". this will be the situation in all cases of interest to us here , and thus we refer to @xmath71 as _ the _ augmentation . here , as in the sequel , we regard @xmath68 as the trivial dg algebra concentrated in degree zero and with trivial differential .",

    "let @xmath81 denote the vector space of @xmath76-derivations of degree @xmath3 , for @xmath82 .",
    "finally , define a linear map @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "a standard check now shows that @xmath85 and thus @xmath86 is a chain complex . in order to cut down on cumbersome notation",

    "a special case of the preceding that is of interest to us is the one in which @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in this case , the chain complex of derivations @xmath93 is just the usual complex of derivations on the dg algebra @xmath94 .",
    "note once again that we restrict the derivations in degree @xmath53 to the cycles and that the complex is zero in non - positive degrees .",
    "pre - composition with the dg algebra map @xmath95 thus gives a map of chain complexes @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , post - composition by the augmentation @xmath97 induces dg vector space maps @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "all of the above can be applied to a map of minimal models .",
