    "game theory deals with the situations where two ( or more ) players or the decision makers compete to maximize their respective gains .",
    "the player s gain known as payoff can be in the form of money or some sort of spiritual happiness which one feels on one s success .",
    "the players are rational in nature therefore , while taking any action to achieve their objectives they keep an eye on the expectations and objectives of the other players and they also know well the strategies to achieve these objectives @xcite . furthermore these interactions are strategic in nature as the payoff of one player depends on his own and as well as on the strategies adopted by other player / players @xcite .",
    "the strategy of players is a complete plan of actions depending on the sensitivity and nature of a particular situation ( game ) .",
    "the rational reasoning of the players for selection of those strategies that maximizes their payoffs decides the outcome of a game .",
    "a set of strategies from which unilateral deviation of a player reduces his / her payoff is called nash equilibrium ( ne ) of the game which is a key concept in the solution of a game @xcite .",
    "game theory was developed by von neumann and morgenstern @xcite and john nash @xcite as a tool to understand economic behaviors .",
    "since then it has been widely used in various fields including warfare , anthropology , social psychology , economics , politics , business , international relations , philosophy and biology .",
    "it is also used by computer scientists in artificial intelligence @xcite and cybernetics @xcite .",
    "there  is an increasing interest in applying the game theoretic concepts to physics @xcite .",
    "some algorithms and protocols of quantum information theory has also been formulated in the language of game theory @xcite .",
    "the problems of classical game theory can be implemented into an experimental ( physical ) set - up by using classical bits .",
    "a classical bit can be represented by any two level system such as a coin i.e. it can be encoded on any system that can take one of the two distinct possible values .",
    "for example a bit on a compact disk means whether a laser beam is reflected or not reflected from its surface .",
    "a bit is represented by the boolean states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to play  two players classical games",
    "experimentally we need an arbiter having two similar coins in same state .",
    "he hands over a coin to each of the player .",
    "the strategies of the players are to flip or not to flip the coin .",
    "the players return their coins to arbiter after playing the respective strategies . checking the state of coins",
    "the arbiter announces the payoffs for players using the payoff matrix known to both the players .",
    "quantum games , on the other hand , are played using quantum bits ( qubits ) and the qubits are much different than their classical counterpart .",
    "a qubit is a microscopic system such as an electron or nuclear spin or a polarized photon . in this case",
    "the boolean states @xmath0 and @xmath2are represented by a pair of reliably distinguished states of the qubit bennett00 .",
    "spin up and spin down of an electron or the horizontal and vertical polarizations of photon are very remarkable examples in this regard .",
    "qubits can exist in form of superposition in two dimensional hilbert space spanned by the unit vectors .",
    "furthermore qubits can also exist in a state totally different than classical states called entangled state .",
    "computers that work on the basis of these quantum resources are known as quantum computers @xcite .",
    "extensive  study of quantum computation motivated the study of quantum information theory .",
    "this relatively new research field taught to think physically about computation and provided with the exciting capabilities for the information storage , processing and communication chuang .",
    "processing of information in quantum domain started an interesting debate among scientists for faster than light communication , a task that is impossible according the einstein s theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "it was directly linked to a question whether it was possible to clone an unknown quantum state .",
    "however , no cloning theorem @xcite proved that the task that was easy to accomplish with classical information is impossible for quantum information .",
    "quantum information theory gave a new brand of cryptography where security does not depend upon the computational complexity but depends upon fundamental physics and introduced quantum computers that can provide the mathematical solutions to certain problems very fast .",
    "it is stated that information theory based on quantum principles extends and completes the classical information theory just as the complex numbers extend and complete the real numbers @xcite .",
    "these fascinating ideas led to translate the problems of game theory into physical set - up that uses qubits instead of classical bits meyer , eisert , marinatto .",
    "quantum game theory started with an interesting story of success of a hypothetical quantum player over a classical player in quantum _ _  _ _ penny flip game @xcite .",
    "david meyer described this game by the story of a spaceship which faces a catastrophe during its journey .",
    "suddenly a quantum being , q , appears to help save the spaceship if picard , the captain of the spaceship , beats him in a penny flipping game . according to the game ,",
    "picard is to place the penny with head up in a box .",
    "q has an option to either flip the penny or leave it unchanged without looking at it .",
    "then picard has the same options without having a look at the penny .",
    "finally q takes the turn with the same options without looking at the penny .",
    "if in the end penny is head up then q wins otherwise picard wins .",
    "captain picard being expert of game theory knows that this game has no deterministic solution and deterministic nash equilibrium neumann , nash . in other words ,",
    "there exist no such pair of pure strategies from which unilateral withdrawal of any player can enhance his / her payoff .",
    "therefore , he agrees to play with q. but to picard s surprise , q always wins .",
    "since the quantum being q is capable of playing quantum strategies which is the superposition of head and tail in the two dimensional hilbert space , thus he is always the winner .    in non - zero sum classical games nash equilibrium ( ne )",
    "is central to analysis , however , this concept has some shortcomings as well .",
    "first , it is not necessarily true that each game has a unique nash equilibrium .",
    "there are examples of the games with multiple nash equilibria where the players can not choose the nash equilibrium e.g. battle of sexes and chicken games .",
    "second , in some cases nash equilibrium could result outcomes being very far from the benefit of players .",
    "prisoners dilemma is an interesting example depicting such a situation where the players trying to maximize their respective payoffsfall in a dilemma and end up with worst outcomes .",
    "quantum game theory helps resolve such dilemmas @xcite and shows that quantum strategies can be advantageous  over classical strategies @xcite . to deal with such situations one of the foremost and elegant quantization schemes",
    "is introduced by eisert",
    "_ et al_. @xcite taking prisoners dilemma as an example . in this quantization scheme",
    "the strategy space of the players is a two parameter set of @xmath3 unitary matrices . starting with maximally entangled initial quantum state the authors showed that for a suitable quantum strategy the dilemma disappears .",
    "they also pointed out a quantum strategy which always wins over all the classical strategies .",
    "marinatto and weber @xcite introduced another interesting and simple scheme for the analysis of non - zero sum classical games in quantum domain .",
    "they gave hilbert structure to the strategic spaces of the players .",
    "they used maximally entangled initial state and allowed the players to play their tactics by applying probabilistic choice of unitary operators .",
    "they applied their scheme to an interesting game of battle of sexes and found out the strategy for which both the players can achieve equal payoffs .",
    "both eisert s and marinatto and weber s _ _  _ _ schemes give interesting results for various quantum analogue of classical games @xcite .",
    "meyer @xcite , in his pioneering work pointed out a connection between quantum games and quantum information processing .",
    "lee and johnson @xcite presented a game theoretic model for quantum state estimation and quantum cloning .",
    "they also developed a connection between quantum games and quantum algorithms @xcite . in this thesis",
    "we introduced a generalized quantization scheme for two person non zero sum games and by using the mathematical framework of this generalized quantization scheme ( chap .",
    "[ general ] ) we have proposed an efficient protocol for quantum key distribution .",
    "this protocol can be used to transmit four symbols for key distribution between sender and receiver  using a two dimensional system , whereas in other quantum key distribution schemes higher dimensional systems are used for this purpose @xcite . using the framework of generalized quantization scheme a protocol for quantum state tomography is also presented .",
    "it can safely be stated that this work is a step forward for strengthening the established link between quantum games and quantum information theory .",
    "thesis layout and statement of original contribution    chapter [ cgt ] is a brief introduction to classical game theorywhile chapter [ qm ] contains some basic concepts of quantum mechanics required to understand quantum games .",
    "chapter [ qgt ] and chapter [ qit ] give reviews of quantum game theory and quantum information theory respectively .    in section ( [ dilemma ] )",
    "we show that the worst case payoffs scenario in quantum battle of sexes , as pointed out by benjamin @xcite , is not due to the quantization scheme itself but it is due to the restriction on the initial state parameters of the game .",
    "if the game is allowed to start from a more general initial entangled state then a condition on the initial state parameters can be set such that the payoffs for the mismatched or the worst case situation are different for different players which results in a unique solution of the game .",

    "_ schemes .",
    "furthermore there have  been identified some other interesting situations which are not apparent within the exiting quantizations schemes.in section ( measurement ) the effects of measurement on quantum games are analyzed under the generalized quantization scheme .",
    "it is observed that as in the case of quantum channel capacities @xcite , one can have four types of payoffs in quantum games for different combinations of input states and measurement basis . furthermore a relation among these payoffs is also established .    in chapter [ correlated noise ]",
    "we analyze quantum games in presence of quantum correlated dephasing channel in the context of our generalized quantization scheme for non - zero sum games .",
    "it is shown that in the limit of maximum correlation the effect of decoherence vanishes and the quantum game behaves as a noiseless game .    in chapter [ crypto ] and [ qst ] ,  using the mathematical framework of generalized quantization scheme , we present protocols for quantum key distribution and quantum state tomography respectively .",

    "the physical situations arising in daily life are represented by abstract models and the contestants are supposed to be rational in nature who reason strategically @xcite .",
    "players play their strategies while keeping an eye on the objectives and expectations of other players and  hence the resulted payoffs are functions of the strategies adopted by all the players involved in the contest .    in the following some basic definitions and terminology required to help understand the mathematical models of game theory",

    "we show that the worst case payoff scenario as pointed out by benjamin is not due to the quantization scheme itself but it is due to the restriction imposed on initial quantum state parameters .",

    "in particular we address the issues pointed out by benjamin @xcite in marinatto and weber @xcite quantum version of the battle of sexes game . in our approach ,",
    "difference in the payoffs for the two players corresponding to so called worst - case situation leads to a unique solution of the game .",

    "since for choosing strategy on the basis of marinatto and weber s argument it requires complete information on the initial quantum state and in quantum games players  are not supposed to measure the initial quantum state as initial quantum state is only used to communicate their choice of local operators to the arbiter @xcite . _",

    "this is because of the fact that the state variables are also the observables for a classical system .",
    "if the values of these variables along with the equations governing the dynamics of the system are exactly known then the future state of the system can be predicted correctly .",
    "the state of the quantum system is described by a normalized vector @xmath45  in a complex linear vector space known as hilbert space .",
    "these state vectors are not observables of quantum mechanics . therefore",

    "discriminating among non orthogonal states is one of the burning issues of quantum information theory . for this purpose various strategies",

    "another interesting strategy for discriminating among non - orthogonal quantum states , known as unambiguous state discrimination , was introduced by i. d. ivanovic @xcite .  for the case of two non orthogonal quantum states ivanovic studied the following problem .",
    "a preparator prepares a collection of quantum systems in a set of two known non - orthogonal quantum states and hands them over to an observer one by one for discrimination .",
    "he showed that if the observer is allowed to obtain inconclusive results occasionally then for the other cases he can perform error free discrimination between the given non - orthogonal states .  since then various strategies have been developed for optimal state discrimination chelfes-1,hillery , dieks , peres1,hillery1 .",
    "all information about a quantum system is encoded in the state of a system but it is one of the great challenges for experimentalists to measure the state of the quantum system perfectly @xcite .",
    "this is because of the fact that the state is not an observable in quantum mechanics peres and therefore , it is not possible to perform all measurements on the single state to extract the whole information about the system .",
    "it is also impossible to create a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state wootters .",
    "therefore , there is no way , even in principle , to infer the quantum state of a single system without some prior knowledge about it ariano .",
    "however it becomes possible to estimate the unknown quantum state of a system when many identical copies of the system are available .",
    "this procedure of reconstructing an unknown quantum state through a series of measurements on a number of identical copies of the system is called quantum state tomography .",
    "each measurement gives a new dimension of system . to reconstruct the exact state of the system infinite number of copies",
    "are required .",
    "this type of procedure was first addressed by fano fano and remained mere speculation until original proposal for quantum tomography and its experimental verification @xcite . since than it has been applied  to the measurement of photon statistics of a semiconductor laser @xcite , reconstruction of density matrix of squeezed vacuum @xcite and  probing the entangled states of light and ions @xcite .    in the following",
    "we present a brief introduction to single qubit tomography following refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "any single qubit density matrix @xmath72 can uniquely be represented with the help of three parameters @xmath444 and pauli matrices @xmath445  by the expression @xmath446where @xmath447 and the other parameters obey the relation @xmath448 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath449  are called stokes parameters and for a quantum state @xmath72  these can be calculated as @xmath450physically these parameters give the outcome of a projective measurements as    @xmath451    where @xmath452 is the probability to measure state @xmath453 given by @xmath454if we are provided with many copies of a quantum state then with the help of orthogonal set of matrices @xmath455 the density matrix ( [ stokes representation ] ) can be written as @xmath456 expression like @xmath457represents the expectation value of the observable .",
    "for example to estimate @xmath458 we measure @xmath459 for @xmath103 numbers of time giving the values @xmath460 all equal to + 1 or -1 .",
    "the average @xmath461 is an estimate to true value of the quantity @xmath462 by central limit theorem this estimate has standard deviation @xmath463 where @xmath464  is the standard deviation for single measurement of @xmath459 that is upper bounded by 1 .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation for estimate @xmath461 is at most @xmath465the standard deviation for each of the measurement in eq .",

    "( [ rho ] ) tomography can be performed for an unknown single qubit state .",
    "a single qubit state can very conveniently be represented by a vector in three dimensional vector space spanned by pauli matrices .",
    "this representation provides very helpful way for geometrical visualization of single qubit state , where all the legal states fall within a unit sphere ( bloch sphere ) . in this representation",
    "all the pure states lie on the surface of the sphere and mixed states fall inside the sphere .",

    "any state @xmath65 and its orthogonal component @xmath468 fall on two opposite points on the surface of the sphere such that the line connecting these points form the axis of the sphere .    for the tomography of an unknown single qubit state",
    "three consecutive measurements are required .",
    "each measurement gives one dimension of the system until one becomes aware of all dimensions after the complete set of measurement .",

    "1 .   errors due to measurement basis:- this type of errors appear by an accidental use of different measurement basis .",
    "it can be reduced by increasing the accuracy of the apparatus .",
    "errors due to counting statistics:- to extract full information about an unknown quantum state it requires infinite number of measurements . on the other hand",
    "all real life measurements can be performed on limited size of ensembles which is a source for this type of errors .",
    "this can be overcome by performing measurement on a larger ensemble .",
