    "non - stationary signals have a time - dependent spectral content , therefore , an adequate characterization of these signals requires joint time and frequency information . among the many time - frequency ( quasi)distributions@xcite @xcite that have been proposed ,",
    "_ wigner - ville _ s ( wv)@xcite @xcite @xmath4 for an analytic signal @xmath5 , is considered to be optimal in the sense that it satisfies the marginals , it is time - frequency shift invariant and it possesses the least amount of spread in the time - frequency plane",
    ".    however , the wv distribution has , in general , positive and negative values and may be non - zero in regions of the time - frequency plane where either the signal or its fourier transform vanish .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that the wv distribution is an accurate mathematical characterization of the signal , in the sense that it can be inverted by @xmath6 its interpretation for signal detection and recognition is no easy matter , because of the negative and  spurious  components .",
    "the origin of this problem lies in the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath8 being non - commuting variables , they can not be simultaneously specified with absolute accuracy and , as a result , there can not be a joint probability density in the time - frequency plane . therefore no joint distribution , even if positive@xcite , may be interpreted as a probability density .",
    "looking back at the original motivation leading to the construction of the time - frequency distributions , namely the characterization of non - stationary signals , we notice that we are asking for more than we really need . to characterize a non - stationary signal what we need",
    "is time and frequency - dependent information , not necessarily a joint probability density , a mathematical impossibility for non - commuting variables .",
    "the solution is very simple .",
    "the time density @xmath9 projects the signal intensity on the time axis and the spectral density @xmath10 projects on the frequency axis . to obtain the required time - frequency information ,",
    "all we need is a family of time and frequency functions @xmath11 , depending on a parameter @xmath12 , which interpolates between time and frequency .",
    "projecting the signal intensity on this variable , that is , computing the density along the @xmath13axis , one obtains a function @xmath14 that has , for each @xmath12 , a probability interpretation .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath15 is a linear combination @xmath16 the parameter @xmath12 being the pair @xmath17 . for definiteness we may choose @xmath18 @xmath19 being a reference time and a reference frequency adapted to the signal to be studied .",
    "the function @xmath20 interpolates between @xmath21 and @xmath22 and , as we will prove below , contains a complete description of the signal . for each @xmath23 the function",
    "@xmath20 is strictly positive and being a bona - fide probability ( in @xmath24 ) causes no interpretation ambiguities .",
    "a similar approach has already been suggested for quantum optics@xcite and quantum mechanics@xcite @xcite @xcite , the non - commuting variable pairs being respectively the quadrature phases @xmath25 and the position - momentum @xmath26 .",
    "this approach , in which to reconstruct an object , be it a signal in signal processing or a wave function in quantum mechanics , one looks at its probability projections on a family of rotated axis , is similar to the _ computerized axial tomography _ ( cat ) method .",
    "the basic difference is that in cat scans one deals with a pair @xmath27 of commuting position variables and here we deal with a plane defined by a pair of non - commuting variables .",
    "for this reason we call the present approach _ non - commutative tomography _ ( nct ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we construct the nct  signal transform and show its positivity and normalization properties .",
    "we also establish the invertibility of the transformation , which shows that it contains a complete description of the signal and establish its relation to the wv distribution . because the nct transform involves the square of the absolute value of a linear functional of the signal",
    ", it is actually easier to compute than bilinear transforms like wv .    in section 3",
    "we work out the analytical form of the nct transform for some signals and also display the @xmath20 in some examples .",
    "we also deal with the problem of using nct to detect the presence of signals in noise for small _ signal to noise ratios _ ( snr ) . here",
    "the essential observation is that , for small snr , the signal may be difficult to detect along @xmath7 or @xmath8 , however , it is probable that there are other directions on the @xmath3 plane along which detection might be easier .",
    "it is the consistent occurrence of many such directions that supplies the detection signature .    finally in section 4",
    "we point out that the nct approach may also be used for other pairs of non - commuting variables of importance in signal processing . as an example we work out the relevant formulas for the scale - frequency pair .",
    "because the fourier transform of a characteristic function is a probability density , we compute the marginal distribution for the variable @xmath28 using the characteristic function method . frequency and time are operators acting in the hilbert space of analytic signals and , in the time - representation , the frequency operator is @xmath29  .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath30 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a normalized signal@xmath33 the fourier transform of the characteristic function is a probability density @xmath34 after some algebra , one obtains the marginal distribution  ( [ 2.2 ] ) in terms of the analytical signal @xmath35 f(t)\\,dt\\right| ^2\\ ] ] with normalization @xmath36 for the case @xmath37 it gives the distribution of the analytic signal in the time domain @xmath38 and for the case @xmath39 the distribution of the analytic signal in the frequency domain @xmath40    the family of marginal distributions @xmath41 contains complete information on the analytical signal .",
    "this may be shown directly .",
    "however it is more interesting to point out that there is an invertible transformation connecting @xmath41 to the wigner - ville quasidistribution , namely @xmath42 w(t,\\omega ) \\,\\frac{dk\\,d\\omega \\,dt}{(2\\pi ) ^2}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 \\,d\\mu \\,d\\nu \\,ds\\ ] ] therefore , because the wv quasidistribution has complete information , in the sense of eq.([1.2 ] ) , so has @xmath41 .",

    "the signal is @xmath97 contrasts the signature shapes of a chirp contribution and a regular sinusoidal pulse .",
    "notice that all @xmath20 values have a probability interpretation .",
    "therefore all peaks or oscillations have a direct physical meaning and , as opposed to the time - frequency quasidistributions , we need not worry about spurious effects .",
    "this is particularly important for the detection of signals in noise , as we will see in the next example .",
    "\\(v ) _ detection of noisy signals by nct _    in fig.4a and 4b we have plotted a time signal @xmath32 and its spectral density @xmath22 . it is really very hard to decide , from these plots , where this signal might have originated from .",
    "now we plot the nct transform ( fig.4c ) and its contour plot ( fig.4d ) with the normalization @xmath92 and @xmath98 .",
    "it still looks quite complex but , among all the peaks , one may clearly see a sequence of small peaks connecting a time around @xmath99 to a frequency around @xmath100 .",
    "in fact the signal was generated as a superposition of a normally distributed random amplitude and random phase noise with a sinusoidal signal of the same average amplitude but operating only during the time interval @xmath101 .",
    "this means that , during the observation time , the signal to noise power ratio is @xmath102 .",
    "the signature that the signal leaves on the nct transform is a manifestation of the fact that , despite its low snr , there is a number of particular directions in the @xmath3 plane along which detection happens to be more favorable .",
    "the reader may convince himself of the soundness of this interpretation by repeating the experiment with different noise samples and noticing that each time the coherent peaks appear at different locations , but the overall geometry of the ridge is the same .    of course , to rely on",
    "a ridge of small peaks for detection purposes only makes sense because the rigorous probability interpretation of @xmath20 renders the method immune to spurious effects .",
    "the method may also be applied to other pairs of non - commuting variables for which , as in the time - frequency case , there can not be a joint probability density .",
