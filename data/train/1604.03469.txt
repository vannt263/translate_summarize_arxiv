    "the search ever deeper into the interior of matter successfully started by rutherford s discovery of atomic structure is going on now at much lower scales ( below 10@xmath4 cm ) at high energy accelerators .",
    "the interaction region of colliding protons can be quantitatively explored with the help of the unitarity condition if experimental data on their elastic scattering are used . with only these two ingredients at hand we are able to show that the energy evolution of the inelastic interaction region demonstrates quite surprising features .",
    "from the theoretical side , the most reliable information comes from the unitarity condition .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath5-matrix @xmath6=1 relates the amplitude of elastic scattering @xmath7 to the amplitudes of inelastic processes @xmath8 . in the @xmath9-channel they are subject to the integral relation ( for more details",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) which can be written symbolically as @xmath10 the variables @xmath9 and @xmath11 are the squared energy and transferred momentum of colliding protons in the center of mass system @xmath12 , @xmath13 at the scattering angle @xmath14 .",
    "the non - linear integral term represents the two - particle intermediate states of the incoming particles .",
    "the second term represents the shadowing contribution of inelastic processes to the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude . following @xcite it is called the overlap function .",
    "this terminology is ascribed to it because the integral there defines the overlap within the corresponding phase space @xmath15 between the matrix element @xmath8 of the @xmath16-th inelastic channel and its conjugated counterpart with the collision axis of initial particles deflected by an angle @xmath14 in proton elastic scattering .",
    "it is positive at @xmath17 but can change sign at @xmath18 due to the relative phases of inelastic matrix elements @xmath8 s .    at @xmath19",
    "it leads to the optical theorem @xmath20 and to the general statement that the total cross section is the sum of cross sections of elastic and inelastic processes @xmath21 i.e. , that the total probability of all processes is equal to one .",
    "here , we show that it is possible to study the space structure of the interaction region of colliding protons using information about their elastic scattering within the unitarity condition . the whole procedure is simplified because in the space representation one gets an algebraic relation between the elastic and inelastic contributions to the unitarity condition in place of the more complicated non - linear integral term @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) .    to define the geometry of the collision we must express all characteristics presented by the angle @xmath14 and the transferred momentum @xmath11 in terms of the transverse distance between the trajectories of the centers of the colliding protons - namely the impact parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "this is easily carried out using the fourier ",
    "bessel transform of the amplitude @xmath24 which retranslates the momentum data to the corresponding transverse space features and is written as @xmath25 the unitarity condition in the @xmath23-representation reads @xmath26 the left - hand side ( the overlap function in the @xmath23-representation ) describes the transverse impact - parameter profile of inelastic collisions of protons .",
    "it is just the fourier ",
    "bessel transform of the overlap function @xmath27 .",
    "it satisfies the inequalities @xmath28 and determines how absorptive the interaction region is , depending on the impact parameter ( with @xmath29 for full absorption and @xmath30 for complete transparency ) .",
    "the profile of elastic processes is determined by the subtrahend in eq .",
    "( [ unit1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath31 is integrated over all impact parameters , it leads to the cross section for inelastic processes .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side would produce the total cross section and the elastic cross section , correspondingly , as should be the case according to eq .",
    "( [ telin ] ) .",
    "the overlap function is often discussed in relation with the opacity ( or the eikonal phase ) @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "thus , full absorption corresponds to @xmath34 and complete transparency to @xmath35 .",
    "the most prominent feature of elastic scattering is the rapid decrease of the differential cross section with increasing transferred momentum , @xmath36 , in the diffraction peak . as a first approximation , at present energies ,",
    "it can be described by the exponential shape with the slope @xmath37 : @xmath38 the diffraction cone contributes predominantly to the fourier - bessel transform of the amplitude . using the above formulae",
    ", one can write the dimensionless @xmath39 as @xmath40 here , the diffraction cone approximation ( [ expb ] ) is inserted .",
    "herefrom , one calculates @xmath41 where we introduce the dimensionless ratio of the cone slope ( or the elastic cross section ) to the total cross section @xmath42 the ratio @xmath43 defines the survival probability of initial protons .",
    "the approximation sign refers to the neglected factor @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the amplitude in the diffraction cone . in what follows",
    "we neglect @xmath45 according to experimental data ( with @xmath46 ) and theoretical considerations which favor its decrease inside the diffraction cone .",
    "thus one gets @xmath47 . \\label{ge}\\ ] ] the inelastic profile depends on two measured quantities - the diffraction cone width @xmath37 and its ratio to the total cross section , @xmath48 .",
    "it scales as a function of @xmath49 .    for central collisions with @xmath50 one",
    "gets @xmath51 this formula is very significant because it follows herefrom that the darkness at the very center is fully determined by only one parameter , @xmath48 , which is the ratio of experimentally measured quantities .",
    "it is given by the ratio of the width of the diffraction cone @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) to the total cross section .",
    "the energy evolution of these quantities defines the evolution of the absorption value .",
    "the interaction region becomes completely absorptive @xmath54 in the center only at @xmath55 and the absorption diminishes for other values of @xmath48 .",
    "however for small variations of @xmath56 the value of @xmath57 varies even less .    in the table",
    ", we show the energy evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 scattering as calculated from experimental data about the total cross section and the diffraction cone slope at corresponding energies .",
    "note , that , for @xmath65 ( which is the case , e.g. , at isr energies ) one gets incomplete absorption @xmath66 at any physical @xmath67 with the largest value reached at @xmath50 because the maximum appears at non - physical values of @xmath23 .",
    "the disk is semi - transparent .    at @xmath55 , which is reached at 7 tev",
    ", the maximum is positioned exactly at @xmath50 , and full absorption occurs there , i.e. @xmath54 . the disk center becomes impenetrable ( black ) .",
    "the strongly absorptive core of the inelastic interaction region grows in size as we see from expansion of eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) at small impact parameters : @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{gb}\\ ] ] the term proportional to @xmath69 vanishes at @xmath55 , and @xmath70 develops a plateau which extends to quite large values of @xmath23 ( about 0.5 fm ) .",
    "the plateau is very flat because the last term starts to play a role at 7 tev ( where @xmath71 gev@xmath72 ) only for larger values of @xmath23 .    at @xmath73 ,",
    "the maximum shifts to positive physical impact parameters .",
    "a dip is formed at @xmath23=0 leading to a concave shaped inelastic interaction region - approaching a toroidal shape .",
    "this dip becomes deeper at larger @xmath48 .",
    "the limiting value @xmath74 leads to complete transparency at the center @xmath50 .     and @xmath75 correspond to isr and lhc energies and agree well with the result of detailed fitting to the elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "a further increase of @xmath48 leads to the toroid - like shape with a dip at @xmath50 .",
    "the values @xmath76 are proposed in @xcite and @xmath77 in @xcite as corresponding to asymptotical regimes .",
    "the value @xmath74 corresponds to the `` black disk '' regime ( @xmath78).,height=340 ]    all these cases are demonstrated in fig . 1 where @xmath31 is plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath49 for different values of the parameter @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) .",
    "the line with @xmath79 corresponds to isr results and with @xmath55 to lhc .",
    "earlier it was shown that the results of analytical calculations according to ( [ ge ] ) and the computation with experimental data directly inserted in the unitarity condition practically coincide ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles shown in fig .",
    "1 are valid so long as we can assume that the differential cross section of elastic scattering decreases exponentially with @xmath36 within the diffraction cone",
    ". they can change if this traditional behavior is no longer valid at higher energies .",
    "slope variations of the order of 1 per cent found at 8 tev by totem @xcite are still not significant .",
    "first , one may assume that @xmath48 will increase without crossing 1 but approaching it asymptotically .",
    "that would imply that its precise value at 7 tev is still slightly lower than 1 within the present experimental errors reported in @xcite would imply @xmath80 with an uncertainty of @xmath81 . ] . then the inelastic profile shown in fig . 1 for @xmath55 will be quite stable with a slow approach to complete blackness in central collisions and a steady increase of its range .",
    "this situation seems most appealing to our theoretical intuition .    however , given the experimentally observed increase of the share of elastic scattering from isr to lhc , it is tempting to consider another intriguing possibility- that there could be a further increase at still higher energy .",
    "then the interaction region inevitably acquires a toroid - like shape with a dip at the very center ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "some extrapolations of fits at lower energies are presented in @xcite and theoretical speculations are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the line with @xmath76 describes the profile of the inelastic interaction region according to asymptotic expectations predicted in @xcite , where successful fits to present experimental data are reported .",
    "the new proposal of @xcite is shown at @xmath77 .",
    "the dip increases at larger @xmath48 and reaches the very bottom @xmath82 for @xmath74 .",
    "strangely enough this situation with @xmath83 is usually referred to as the `` black disk '' limit @xcite .",
    "protons become impenetrable when @xmath50 for @xmath74 and only undergo elastic scattering .",
    "it is discussed in ref .",
    "this condition results in purely backward scattering ( as in head - on collisions of billiard balls ) .    in conclusion , we can state that , analyzing the unitarity condition , we have found a special role for the ratio of elastic to total cross sections being equal to 1/4 in 7 tev pp - interactions and described the consequences of its energy evolution .",
    "this role could be attributed to an equal share of processes with exchange and no - exchange of quantum numbers in particle collisions .",
    "then elastic processes constitute a half of the no - exchange share .",
    "another half would be attributed to inelastic diffraction processes .",
    "that would lead to saturation of the pumplin bound @xcite which states that their sum is less or equal to 0.5 of the total cross section .",
    "however there is still no consensus among experiments about the saturation of the bound at 7 tev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although there is currently a large latitude for the inelastic diffractive cross sections permitted by the accuracy of the experiments , as was pointed out in @xcite the value presented in @xcite corresponds to perfect agreement with the above picture ( ie the above - metioned saturation ) .    in general ,",
    "inelastic diffraction is determined by the dispersion of matrix elements while only their averages enter into eqs ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) .",
    "some models have to be invoked in order to predict the dispersion . on a qualitative level it looks as though",
    "the absorptive structure of protons is extremely inhomogeneous @xcite . that could explain the behavior of the inelastic profile described above .        99 pdg group , china phys .",
