    "gamma - ray emission in gev energies has been detected in several bright bls @xcite .",
    "a handful of nearby , bright bls have been also detected in the tev regime ( e.g. aharonian et al . 2005 ) .",
    "gamma - ray emission at some level is expected from radio galaxies , since , according to the unified scheme ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , bls are fr i radio galaxies @xcite with their relativistic jets oriented toward the observer .",
    "so far , the only radio galaxies detected in gamma - rays are the fr i s cen a @xcite and m87 ( _ hegra _ , aharonian et al . 2003 ; _ hess _ , beilicke et al .",
    "2005 ) at tev energies .",
    "also , a tentative gev detection of ngc 6251 @xcite has been strengthened by its hard x - ray detection .",
    "( foschini et al 2005 ) .",
    "m87 is among the nearest galaxies with a bright radio / optical / x - ray jet . due to its proximity (",
    "distance 16 mpc ) the jet has been studied with unparalleled spatial resolution ( e.g. , perlman et al . 1999 , 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the synchrotron emission extends to x - ray energies in all jet knots , as well as the core ( e.g. , perlman et al .",
    "2001 , marshall et al .",
    "2002 , wilson & yang 2002 , perlman & wilson 2005 ) .",
    "_ hst _ observations of the core @xcite showed variability on timescales of @xmath3 month .",
    "_ hst _ and _ chandra _ semi - monthly monitoring of the jet during the last three years ( harris et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; perlman et al .",
    "2003 ) established the broadband nature of this variability .",
    "surprisingly , these observations detected an enormous ( factor @xmath4 ) ongoing flare in the jet component hst-1 , @xmath5 ( 60 pc projected ) from the core , with similar variability timescales .",
    "the discovery of flaring optical and x - ray emission established an important link between m87 and the bls , as did the detection of apparent superluminal motion in the jet at radio @xcite and optical @xcite frequencies .",
    "the apparent superluminal velocities in the optical of @xmath6 c require a jet orientation angle @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the detection of tev emission constitutes another link between fr i s and bls .",
    "the tev data appear to indicate significant variability , as the 1998/99 ( _ hegra _ ) and 2003/04 ( _ hess _ ) fluxes differ by over a factor 3 at @xmath9 significance ( beilicke et al .",
    "2005 ) . in bls , correlated x - ray and tev variations ( e.g. takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that the tev emission is produced at the core . in the case of m87 ,",
    "it is necessary to consider as possible tev emitters three components with comparable optical and x - ray synchrotron luminosity : the core , hst-1 , and knot a , an extended jet feture located @xmath10 from the core .",
    "based on the likely tev variability , we argue in  2 that the most plausible source of the tev emission is the core and not hst-1 or knot a. in  3 we consider the modeling constraints imposed by the core sed and the unified scheme and show that homogeneous models can not satisfy these constraints .",
    "we then show (  3.1 ) that a decelerating relativistic jet can solve these problems .",
    "finally , in  4 we sum up our conclusions .",
    "the production of tev photons requires tev energy electrons , which also emit optical  x - ray synchrotron radiation , resulting in correlated tev and optical  x - ray variability . the possible tev emission sites are , therefore , the brightest optical  x - ray features of the m87 jet .",
    "these are the core and knots a and hst-1 , all of comparable optical and x - ray fluxes ( within a factor @xmath11 ) .",
    "we now use the fact that the tev emission has likely dropped by a factor of @xmath12 between 1998/99 and 2003/04 , to constrain the actual tev source .",
    "we first consider knot a , one of the largest bright regions in the m87 jet , with its flux maximum region @xmath13 in _ hst _ @xcite and _ chandra _",
    "@xcite images , translating to 80 @xmath14 55 pc ( projected ) .",
    "such a large region can not vary on timescales of a few years , and , indeed , monitoring by both rosat @xcite and _ chandra _ @xcite does not detect variability of more than @xmath15 in the x - rays .",
    "we turn now to knot hst-1 , which is currently exceeding the core flux in the optical , uv , and x - rays by factors @xmath16 , depending on the band ( harris et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; perlman et al . 2003 ) . in spring 2004 , the x - ray flux of hst-1 was @xmath12 times brighter than it was in spring 2003 , and since 1998/99 the increase is far larger ",
    "nearly a factor 50 . by comparison , there is no evidence of an increase in tev flux from 2003 to 2004 , or from 1998 to 2004 @xcite .",
    "since the x - ray and tev variations are not correlated , the contribution of hst-1 to the tev output of m87 seems not to be significant .",
    "this may indicate a low synchrotron photon compactness for hst-1 , which can be used to set , in a manner similar to that of stawartz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for knot a , a lower limit on its magnetic field .",
    "having excluded knots a and hst-1 , we turn to the core .",
    "_ hst , rosat _ and _ chandra _ monitoring ( harris et al . 1999 , 2003 ,",
    "comm . ; perlman et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that its variations may be similar to those observed by hegra and hess in 1998/99 , and 2003/04 .",
    "we therefore believe that the most likely source for the tev emission is the core of m87 .",
    "given the @xmath3 month variability timescale of the core emission , its modeling requires contemporaneous broadband observations .",
    "the most complete coverage of the core sed is that of april and may 2003 ( figure [ m87sed ] ) .",
    "we include non - contemporaneous radio and ir data ( crosses ) , given that the amplitude of the core variability does not exceed a factor of @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "we also plot the @xmath18 _ egret _ upper limit @xcite , with the gray band reaching up to a flux 4 times larger than the detection limit , as expected when the ic seed photons are the source s synchrotron photons : a change in the electron injection results respectively in linear and quadratic changes of the synchrotron and ic fluxes .",
    "the synchrotron peak between @xmath19 hz corresponds to a cooling break rather that to a cutoff of the electron energy distribution ( eed ) , because this component exhibits a power - law shape that extends to x - ray energies ( e.g. marshall et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this can be seen in the 2003 spectral data @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the synchrotron sed from april to may 2003 must be accompanied by a quadratic decrease in the ic sed .",
    "if there was no synchrotron contribution in the x - rays , the x - ray spectral slope should have remained constant , with only a reduction of the x - ray flux .",
    "however , the x - ray slope steepens , suggesting a significant synchrotron contribution in the low state . note that an extrapolation of the two higher energy fluxes ( 1.4 and 4.0 kev ) down to 0.5 kev overproduces the 0.5 kev flux in both april and may 2003 .",
    "this may be due to an intrinsic absorption component @xcite .",
    "the sed of the core of m87 , together with the fr i - bl unification ( urry & padovani 1995 ) argue against a homogeneous model for the core .",
    "the synchrotron sed of tev bls is characterized by a spectral break at @xmath20 hz , with the sed still increasing above this break , to reach its peak at @xmath21 hz , beyond which it exhibits a cutoff ( e.g. the 1997 flare of mkn 501 , krawczynski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the declining ir ",
    "optical  x - ray sed of the core of m87 .",
    "because relativistic motion preserves the sed shape , simply shifting it along the frequency and luminosity axes , a simple boosting can not shift the sed of the core of m87 into the mold of the sed of the tev bls .",
    "even if m87 is a special case that , if aligned , does not resemble the tev bl lacs , we still need to reproduce its sed .",
    "this turns out to be practically impossible for the homogeneous model . to sketch why this is the case",
    ", we will make use of four quantities derived or constrained by observations : the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath22 hz , the synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath23 erg s@xmath24 , the compton dominance ( ratio of ic to synchrotron luminosity ) @xmath25 , and the variability timescale @xmath26 month .",
    "the bolometric synchrotron luminosity is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 is the index of the injected power law electron distribution . if @xmath30 is the lorentz factor where the cooling time equals the escape time , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the magnetic field and @xmath33 is the radius of the source , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the usual doppler factor . noting that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the synchrotron photon energy density and @xmath38 is the magnetic field energy density , we have @xmath39 .",
    "using these expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , together with @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the last expression permits only a very narrow range @xmath45 , even after allowing for a generous range in the sed - derived parameters . using the above and noting that the peak of the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) component is at a frequency @xmath46",
    ", we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the variability timescale in months . for a sed ",
    "derived set of parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 for @xmath54 required by spectral fitting ) , the ssc component can not peak at @xmath55 hz , even for @xmath56 hz .    while at @xmath57 the emission is in the thomson regime , due to the reduced klein - nishina cross - section the ssc luminosity @xmath58 at higher frequencies drops much faster , @xmath59 ( georganopoulos et al .",
    ", in prep ) , than anticipated in the thomson case , @xmath60 . because of this steeper sed at the upper end of the ssc component and the upper limit on @xmath57 ( see eq . ( 1 ) above ) , homogeneous models fail to match the observed tev flux .",
    "a typical example of this is shown in figure [ m87sed ] , where we plot the sed for two different jet powers . note how in the low state the stronger reduction of the ssc sed results in a steeper x - ray spectrum , in agreement with the observations .",
    "it has been noted ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003b , gk03b ) that homogeneous models can fit the sed of tev bls only by invoking very high doppler factors ( @xmath61 ; e.g. krawczynski , coppi , & aharonian 2002 ) .",
    "similarly fast flows ( perlman et al . 2003 ) are required by homogeneous models if one wants to relate the m87 variability timescale ( @xmath62 month ) with those of tev blazars ( @xmath63 few hours ) .",
    "these values are in strong disagreement with the bl ",
    "fr i unification , because they severely underpredict the observed fr i luminosities and overpredict their number counts @xcite .",
    "they also conflict with the slow apparent motions ( @xmath64 ) in the pc - scale jets of tev bls @xcite .",
    "this motivated gk03b to propose that tev bl jets decelerate at sub - pc scales from an initial lorentz factor @xmath65 down to @xmath66 few .",
    "in such flows , electrons are more energetic in the faster base of the flow and are radiatively cooled to lower energies as they advect downstream where the jet decelerates .",
    "beaming , hence , is frequency dependent .",
    "in addition to this , upstream compton ( uc ) scattering , a newly identified mechanism @xcite in which the energetic electrons of the upstream fast flow see the seed photon field produced by the lower energy electrons of the slower downstream flow boosted , increases the level and beaming of high energy compton emission .",
    "we apply this model to the core of m87 , assuming a deceleration from @xmath67 to @xmath68 over a distance of @xmath69 cm .",
    "we plot the sed as seen at an angle @xmath70 for two different jet luminosities in figure [ decelm87 ] . in both cases",
    "most of the observed power comes from the slower part of the flow ( dotted lines ) , although the tev flux is uc emission from the fast base of the flow ( broken lines ) .",
    "note that , as in homogeneous models , a decrease of the jet luminosity ( lower panel ) results in a steeper - when lower x - ray sed , in agreement with observations .    to check",
    "if , in addition to reproducing the sed , this model can reproduce the qualitative characteristics of tev bls , we plot in figure [ tevblazars ] in thick lines the same sed viewed at @xmath71 ( for comparison we re - plot in thin lines the sed viewed at @xmath70 ) .",
    "while at @xmath70 , @xmath72 hz corresponds to the eed cooling break , at @xmath73 the increased beaming in the fast base of the flow dominates the high energy emission , resulting in @xmath74 hz . the ic flux increases more than the synchrotron , due mostly to uc emission from the fast base of the flow , resulting in a compton dominance @xmath75 , comparable to that of 1es 1426 + 428 , the most compton dominated tev bl ( costamante et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the 1998/99 tev flux of m87 is higher than the 2003/04 flux by over a factor 3 at @xmath76 significance ( beilicke et al .",
    "2005 ) . based on this and on optical and x - ray variability constraints",
    ", we argued that the source of the tev emission of m87 is its core , as has been previously predicted both in the context of leptonic @xcite and hadronic models @xcite .",
    "we excluded knot a because of its large size and weak or absent variability , and hst 1 because its optical and x - ray flux increased , while the tev ( hess ) flux remained constant or slightly decreased between 2003 and 2004 .",
    "tev emission from either the extended jet of m87 @xcite or from hadronic processes in the giant elliptical galaxy itself @xcite also do not agree with the observed tev variability .",
    "@xcite used the fact that the tev emission varies to set an upper limit on the actual tev emission of knot a ( lower that the lowest tev flux observed ) , and , through this , a lower limit on its magnetic field . a homogeneous core model is not favored , because it can not reproduce the core sed and is inconsistent with the unified scheme . a decelerating relativistic flow ( gk03b )",
    "satisfies both the sed modeling and unification requirements .",
    "this is in contrast to both cen a and ngc 6251 , that have be modeled as homogeneous sources @xcite .",
    "neither of these sources is superluminal , suggesting a jet inclination larger than that of m87 and , in the context of a decelerating flow , a sed dominated by the slower part of the jet .",
    "since this is characterized by small velocity gradients , their seds can be accommodated by homogeneous models .",
    "an orientation difference also explains the lack of tev emission from these sources : their tev emission is more tightly beamed along the jet axis and points away from our line of sight .",
    "the postulated deceleration could be due to entrainment of external matter ( e.g. bowman , leahy , & komissarov 1996 ) or compton drag ( e.g. melia & knigl 1989 ) on a photon field external to the high energy emitting jet , such as in the fast spine  slow sheath model of ghisellini , tavecchio , & chiaberge ( 2005 ) . both longitudinal ( gk03b ) and lateral ( ghisellini et al . 2005 )",
    "velocity gradients can be present and quantifying their importance will require detailed variability modeling .",
    "we note that arguments for further deceleration have been presented for fr i jets at @xmath77 kpc scales @xcite , and for powerful fr ii and quasars jets at @xmath78 s of kpc @xcite .",
    "we end with a cautionary note : if m87 were at a distance similar to that of tev bls , the core and knot hst-1 would be seen as a single unresolved source in both optical and x - ray energies .",
    "modeling the broadband sed as being produced at a single site could then result to unrealistic jet descriptions .",
