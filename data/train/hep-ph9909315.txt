    "<S> a muon collider with controllable energy resolution and transverse beam polarization provides a powerful probe of the higgs sector in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with explicit cp violation , through @xmath0-channel production of higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the production rates and the cp  even and cp  odd transverse  polarization asymmetries are complementary in diagnosing cp violation in the higgs sector .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of higgs bosons and the detailed investigation of their fundamental properties are crucial for our understanding of the mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this crucial quest in particle physics constitutes the primary reason for having a @xmath1 collider ( mc ) @xcite , the physics potential of which has been investigated with a considerable amount of effort . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that muons are significantly heavier than electrons makes a mc very attractive for both practical and theoretical reasons @xcite : ( i ) synchrotron radiation does not limit their circular acceleration and multi - tev energies for a mc can be realized ; ( ii ) the muon beam energy distribution is not smeared out by beamstrahlung ; ( iii ) the larger yukawa couplings of muons in many cases allow for copious production of higgs bosons as @xmath0-channel resonances , making precision studies of the higgs sector possible . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one can search for cp violation in the couplings of higgs bosons to muons by measuring the production rates and the polarization asymmetries constructed with transversely polarized muon beams @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we point out the possibility of studying loop  induced cp  violating scalar  pseudoscalar mixing @xcite through @xmath0-channel production of neutral higgs bosons at a mc in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental tools assumed to be available for this investigation are controllable beam energy resolution and beam polarization , for both muons and anti  muons . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the mssm has several new cp  violating phases which are absent in the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has recently been pointed out @xcite that these phases do not have to be suppressed in order to satisfy the constraints from electron and neutron electric dipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interst in this context is the so  called effective supersymmetry ( susy ) model @xcite in which sfermions of the first and second generations are decoupled1 tev ) , the phases can be large without substantial fine  tuning @xcite . ] , but sfermions of the third generation remain relatively light to preserve naturalness . motivated by scenarios of this type , we concentrate on cp violation in the higgs sector induced at one  loop level by cp  violating phases in the stop and sbottom sectors . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic cp  violating phenomena in this scheme are a possibly large mixing between the cp  even and cp  odd neutral higgs bosons and an induced relative phase @xmath2 @xcite between the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant source of one  loop radiative corrections to the higgs potential of the mssm are the stop and sbottom sectors due to the large @xmath3 and ( for large values of @xmath4 ) @xmath5 yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> then , the characteristic size of cp violation induced in the higgs sector is determined by the factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the yukawa coupling of the fermion @xmath8 , @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a typical susy  breaking scale , the square of which might be taken to be the average of two sfermion ( @xmath12 ) masses squared , i.e. @xmath13 $ ] . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we take a common phase @xmath14 for @xmath15 and present results for the following parameter values : @xmath16 in addition , noting that the @xmath17violating phases could weaken the present experimental bounds on the lightest higgs mass up to about 60 gev @xcite , we simply apply the lower mass limit @xmath18 gev to the lightest higgs  boson determining the lowest allowed value of @xmath19 for a given set of susy parameters . for the parameter @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , we take @xmath21 or @xmath22 as the values representing the small and large @xmath20 cases , respectively . this representative choice ( [ eq : para ] ) of parameters , ( which was considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as well ) , enables us to avoid the possible barr  zee type edm constraints @xcite on the phase @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson masses and couplings to the sm particles are then completely determined by three independent parameters @xmath23 .    in the mssm with explicit cp violation , </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to the sm fermions are significantly affected by scalar  </S>",
    "<S> pseudoscalar mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the interactions of the neutral higgs bosons with muons are described by the lagrangian : @xmath24\\mu\\ , h_i\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the transpose of @xmath25 is the @xmath26 orthogonal matrix rotating three neutral higgs bosons @xmath27 into three mass eigenstates @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) with the mass ordering @xmath30 : @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction lagrangian enables one to derive the helicity amplitudes @xmath32 for the @xmath0-channel production of the neutral higgs bosons in @xmath1 collisions , which are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the unpolarized cross section @xmath36 for the @xmath0-channel process @xmath37 is expressed in terms of the decay width @xmath38 as @xmath39 and the polarized @xmath0-channel cross section is given in a simple form as @xmath40 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) denote the longitudinal , transverse and normal polarizations of the @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) beam and the transverse  polarization ( tp ) asymmetries @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined in terms of the helicity amplitudes @xmath32 as @xmath47 here , the @xmath45 are cp  even , but the @xmath46 are cp  odd . in the cp  </S>",
    "<S> invariant theories , they should satisfy the relations ; @xmath48 depending on whether @xmath28 is a pure cp  even or cp  odd state , and @xmath49 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 and @xmath51 imply cp violation directly .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical quantities determining the unpolarized cross sections are the total widths of the higgs bosons , their partial decay widths @xmath52 , as well as their masses . the higgs masses , in particular , the lightest higgs boson mass are expected to be measured with an error of less than 100 mev at @xmath53 or @xmath1 colliders @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , it is possible to probe higgs boson physics by setting the beam energy very close to the higgs mass . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-channel studies of narrow higgs resonances depend critically on the beam energy resolution @xmath54 with respect to the resonance width @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum of each beam is expected to be gaussian to a good approximation with an rms deviation @xmath56 and with a capability of changing @xmath57 from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . of crucial importance </S>",
    "<S> are then the ratios of the rms error @xmath60 for the given @xmath57 and the calculated total widths of higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> according to a detailed analysis of higgs boson decays @xcite , the widths of the heavier higgs states @xmath61 are much larger than the width , @xmath62 can be as large as 1 gev which requires a larger @xmath57 to satisfy @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> ] of the lightest higgs boson @xmath64 , which is of the order of mev for a small value of @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> . it will thus be reasonable to take an energy resolution @xmath57 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective cross section @xmath67 is given by a convolution with the gaussian beam energy distribution : @xmath68 } {                                \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_e } ~d\\sqrt{s'}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath60 satisfying @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the effective unpolarized cross sections @xmath69 at @xmath70 @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of the effective unpolarized cross sections yield @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in addition , it is possible to measure the polarization  </S>",
    "<S> dependent quantities @xmath45 and @xmath75 by use of transversely  polarized muon and anti  muon beams , giving independent information on the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings of the higgs bosons to muons .    as shown explicitly in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath76 is almost independent of @xmath14 , but @xmath73 ( as well as @xmath62 ) is strongly dependent on @xmath14 . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 depend significantly on @xmath14 , but @xmath77 are almost independent of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective unpolarized cross sections are thus expected to be very sensitive to @xmath14 because their measurements correspond to those of the strongly phase  dependent quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will demonstrate these encouraging aspects in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the lightest higgs boson_@xmath78 in our numerical analysis , we take @xmath79 , which corresponds to @xmath80 for @xmath81 . as shown in fig .  1 , for a fixed cp  violating phase the effective unpolarized cross section @xmath82 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath83 , approaching the ( phase  independent ) cross section for the production of the sm higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> however , for most of the lightest higgs  boson mass @xmath83 , the cross section @xmath82 depends strongly on the cp  </S>",
    "<S> odd phase @xmath14 , i.e. on the charged higgs  boson mass , except for small @xmath83 for @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as far as the unpolarized cross section is concerned , changing the soft stop / sbottom sector parameters could mimic the effects of changing the cp  violating phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is crucial to confirm the existence of the finite cp  violating phase _ directly _ through the tp asymmetries @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the cp  even and cp  odd asymmetries versus @xmath83 , the size of which is independent of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> these tp asymmetries are generally very sensitive to the phase @xmath14 for both @xmath21 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the only exception again occurs in the `` decoupling limit '' @xmath87 , where @xmath83 approaches its upper limit and the tp asymmetries take their sm values ( @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also that , except in the decoupling limit , the total cross section scales @xmath89 , while the @xmath90 dependence of the tp asymmetries is relatively mild . in this light , the unpolarized cross section and the polarization asymmetries play a complementary role in extracting the values of mssm parameters .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the heavier higgs bosons_@xmath78 the branching ratios @xmath91 determined independently of @xmath60 ( @xmath92 ) are in general strongly dependent on the phase @xmath14 for a small value of @xmath20 , unlike @xmath93 , which remains almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , they become ( almost ) independent of @xmath14 for large @xmath20 where fermionic decay modes are by far the dominant ones . we therefore study the effective unpolarized cross sections @xmath94 only for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> results are presented in fig .  3 , which shows @xmath94 versus @xmath95 , respectively , for various values of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections without cp violation decrease abruptly with increasing @xmath95 , especially when new decay channels ( @xmath96 ) open up , but the monotonic decrease is not retained for non  vanishing values of the phase @xmath14 . in particular , for small higgs boson masses the cross sections are significantly affected by the phase @xmath14 . for large higgs boson masses </S>",
    "<S> they are not so strongly dependent on the phase , since here the total widths of the unmixed heavy scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons are both dominated by the partial widths into @xmath97 , which become identical for both modes in the limit of large higgs boson masses .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis for the unpolarized cross sections for heavy higgs bosons clearly shows the need to use other independent observables to determine the effects of the cp phase for large values of higgs masses . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore investigate the dependence of the cp  even and cp  odd tp asymmetries @xmath98 and @xmath99 on the cp phase . </S>",
    "<S> the tp asymmetries @xmath100 and @xmath101 versus @xmath102 are presented in fig .  4 and the tp asymmetries @xmath103 and @xmath104 versus @xmath105 in fig .  5 , for the parameter set ( [ eq : para ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find three interesting aspects concerning those tp asymmetries : ( i ) for both @xmath21 and @xmath84 all the tp asymmetries are very sensitive to the cp phase . </S>",
    "<S> this strong dependence will be essential in determining the cp phase for a large value of @xmath20 and large @xmath106 , because in that case all unpolarized cross sections ( for given higgs masses ) are nearly independent of @xmath14 , as mentioned before ; ( ii ) if the cp  even tp asymmetries are small in size , then the cp  </S>",
    "<S> odd tp asymmetries are large in size and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> this property stems from the self  </S>",
    "<S> evident sum rule @xmath107 for every @xmath108 ; ( iii ) except for the low mass regime where mixing between the lightest higgs state and the heavier higgs states is enhanced , the cp  even tp asymmetries of the two heavy states are opposite in sign and so are the cp  odd tp asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the fact that the lightest higgs state is ( almost ) decoupled from the two heavy states , so that the latter undergo typical two  state mixing . as the tp asymmetries have opposite signs for two higgs bosons , there will be sizable cancellations if two states are degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using the tp asymmetries as a powerful probe of the cp phase requires that the mass difference be at least comparable to or larger than their decay widths . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we have checked that even for @xmath84 the mass difference is indeed comparable to the decay widths in the cp  invariant case and it becomes larger for non  trivial values of the cp phase unless the masses are larger than 500 gev @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> cp  violating phases in the stop and sbottom sectors modify the mass spectrum and couplings of the higgs bosons significantly from those in the cp  invariant theory . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a controllable energy resolution and beam polarization at a mc offer powerful and independent opportunities for probing the mssm higgs sector via @xmath0channel resonance production even with loop  induced explicit cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> for the very narrow lightest higgs  boson resonance , a relatively large beam energy resolution allows one to measure the muonic decay width precisely , and the measured width is complementary to the cp  even and cp  odd tp asymmetries in determining the free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a large value of @xmath20 and large @xmath106 , it turned out that measurements of the transverse polarization asymmetries of the _ heavier _ higgs bosons are essential for determining the cp phase . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of transversely polarized beams at a muon collider would therefore be of crucial importance for precisely probing the characteristics of the higgs sector in the general cp  </S>",
