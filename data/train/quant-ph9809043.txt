    "entanglement purification @xcite is one of the most important tools in the theory of quantum information and , in particular , in quantum communication .",
    "it allows , in principle , to create maximally entangled states of particles at different locations , even if the channel that connects those locations is noisy @xcite .",
    "these entangled particles can be then used for faithful teleportation @xcite or secure quantum cryptography @xcite .    the basic idea in entanglement purification",
    "is to `` distill '' a few @xmath0 pairs of particles ( qubits , for example ) in highly entangled states out of @xmath1 pairs in a mixed state with lower fidelity of the entanglement ( or , in short , fidelity ) using local operations and measurements .",
    "this fidelity is defined as the maximum overlap of the density operator of a pair of qubits with a maximal entangled state . if the initial pairs are in a non ",
    "separable state @xcite , then one can obtain asymptotically ( in the limit @xmath2 ) maximally entangled states @xcite provided all local operations and measurements are perfect @xcite . in practice",
    ", there will be errors both in the local operations and measurements .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze this problem for the purification protocols introduced in refs .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the conditions under which one can purify in the presence of errors , as well as in the limitations of the purification protocols .",
    "in particular , we find a non  linear map which relates a lower bound for the fidelity at two consecutive steps of the purification protocol , which allows us to derive lower bounds for the reachable fidelity . in order to analyze this problem",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath3 which characterizes the errors .",
    "it measures the distance between the ideal operations and measurements and the ones in the presence of errors .",
    "quantum communication in the presence of errors has been previously considered by knill and laflamme @xcite in a general context , and by van enk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a particular experimental setup @xcite .",
    "the work of knill and laflamme introduced ideas of fault  tolerant quantum computation @xcite to show that there exists an accuracy threshold for storage of quantum information , which also applies to the case of quantum communication . as shown by bennett _",
    "@xcite one can rephrase this result in terms of entanglement purification with _",
    "one  way classical communication_. in ref .",
    "@xcite , entanglement purification together with a generic error model is used to estimate the possibilities of quantum communication over long distances using quantum repeaters .",
    "the employed entanglement purification protocols explicitely utilize _ two  way classical communication _ , which makes them much more efficient for quantum communication . in the present paper we use purification protocols which utilze _ two ",
    "way classical communication _ , and therefore our lower bounds are much higher than those derived from the theory of knill and laflamme @xcite . on the other hand , we are interested in a rigorous lower bound for the achievable fidelity for arbitrary errors , and not in an estimation @xcite . the results and methods developed here can be generalized to derive lower bounds for other interesting problems in which local operations and measurements are imperfect , such as quantum teleportation or quantum cryptography .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii contains a summary of the main results of this paper , and is directed to the reader who is interested neither in the technical details of the definitions of our error parameter , nor in the derivations of the non  linear maps for the lower bound of the fidelity . in section iii",
    "we introduce the error parameter @xmath3 and derive some properties related to the fact that it is a distance between completely positive linear maps .",
    "finally , in section iv we derive the non  linear map for the fidelity of entanglement in terms of this distance and sketch its dynamics .",
    "in the standard scenario of entanglement purification @xcite , two partners at different locations share @xmath4 pairs of qubits , each pair being in a state described by a density operator @xmath5 .",
    "a purification procedure produces @xmath6 pairs in a state @xmath7 `` closer '' to a maximally entangled state @xmath8 by only using local operations , local measurements , and classical communication between the partners . more specifically , if we define the fidelity of the entanglement",
    "f()=__me _ me||_me , where the maximization is taken with respect to maximally entangled states @xmath8 , then @xmath9 . in the following",
    "we will call @xmath10 simply fidelity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if @xmath5 is non  separable ( it can not be written as a convex combination of factorized density operators @xcite ) then there are purification procedures which obtain @xmath11 in the asymptotic limit @xmath12 . in particular , if @xmath13 one can reach this goal by using the _ purification procedure _ devised by bennett _",
    "et al _ @xcite and improved by deutsch _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it consists of a concatenation of _ purification steps _ involving two pairs of qubits , which give rise to a single pair with higher fidelity . in all these procedures",
    ", one assumes that the local operations and measurements are error free . in a real situation",
    ", however , there will be errors due to the coupling to the environment , imprecise apparatus , etc .",
    "although small , they will limit the maximum attainable fidelity and will dictate whether purification is possible or not .",
    "in this section we first briefly review the purification protocol introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , and define the notation that we will use later on .",
    "then we consider the same procedure in the presence of general errors , and characterize these errors in terms of a single parameter , @xmath3 , which basically expresses the departure of the purification step in the presence of errors from the ideal one .",
    "next , we express the lowest possible fidelity ( worst case ) in each purification step as a function of the lowest possible fidelity in the previouos step , which leads to a non  linear map .",
    "we analyze this map and discuss the conditions required for purification with imperfect means .",
    "the properties of our definitions and the technical details are presented in the following sections .      in this subsection",
    "we review the two purification procedures introduced in refs .",
    ". subsequently we will refer to them as scheme i and ii , respectively .",
    "we characterize them in two different ways : firstly , in terms of a completely positive linear map between the initial density operator and the one after the measurement ; secondly , in terms of a non  linear map relating the diagonal matrix elements of the density operator at each step in the bell basis with the ones in the previous step . in the next subsection",
    "we will generalize the first characterization to the case of imperfect operations in order to introduce the parameter describing the errors , and then we will generalize the second characterization to find a lower bound for the fidelity .    the purification protocols i and ii both consist of a sequence of _ steps _ in which local operations are applied to two pairs of qubits , followed by a measurement of one of the pairs which is then discarded .",
    "depending on the outcome of the measurement , the other pair is discarded or not . in the latter case",
    "the fidelity @xmath14 of the remaining pair is larger than that of the original ones .",
    "this step is applied to the @xmath4 pairs obtaining @xmath15 pairs of higher fidelity @xmath14 .",
    "then it is applied to the resulting @xmath16 pairs obtaining @xmath17 pairs of fidelity @xmath18 .",
    "continuing in this vein , one can reach asymptotically @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "let us consider a single purification step .",
    "it starts out with two pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the state @xmath23 , applies the local operations described by the superoperator @xmath24 ( unitary in the case of scheme ii ) and then measures each of the qubits of the second pair in the basis @xmath25 .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the outcome of the measurement : @xmath27 if the qubits are found in the state @xmath28 ; @xmath29 if they are in @xmath30 ; @xmath31 if they are in @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 if they are in @xmath34 ( the subscript @xmath22 denotes the second pair ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) the map defined as follows [ pxideal ] p_x ( _ 12 ) _",
    "2x|u(_12 ) |x_2 .",
    "this map is linear and completely positive .",
    "the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath26 is @xmath37 $ ] . if the outcome is @xmath38 , then the first pair is discarded and otherwise it is kept . in the latter case ,",
    "the state of the first pair will be [ rhop ] _",
    "thus , each step of the purification protocol is completely characterized by the maps @xmath39 .",
    "( note that @xmath35 stand for different maps depending on whether we are discussing scheme i or scheme ii . )    on the other hand , if one is only interested in the fidelity at each step , one can use a simpler characterization of each purification step in terms of four real numbers . in the purification protocols i and ii , the local operations characterized by @xmath24 consist of a bilateral xor gate and specific single qubit rotations . in that case , the diagonal elements of the density operator @xmath7 in the bell basis only depend on the diagonal elements of the density operator @xmath5 , and therefore each purification step can be characterized by a non  linear map between these four diagonal matrix elements .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the density operator after the @xmath42th purification step and @xmath43 are the elements of the bell basis ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45    in particular , @xmath46 , the entanglement fidelity at each step . for scheme",
    "ii there is according to ref .",
    "@xcite a simple non  linear map that relates @xmath47 to @xmath48 , namely [ mapox ] a_n+1^i & = & + & = : & , where [ fig ] f^0(a_n ) & = & ( a_n^0)^2+(a_n^1)^2 , + f^1(a_n ) & = & 2a_n^2 a_n^3 , + f^2(a_n ) & = & ( a_n^2)^2+(a_n^3)^2 , + f^3(a_n ) & = & 2a_n^0 a_n^1 , + g(a_n ) & = & ( a_n^0+a_n^1)^2 + ( a_n^2+a_n^3)^2 .",
    "the map ( [ mapox ] ) has a fixed point at @xmath49 , which is reached if the initial state has @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this fact expresses that in the absence of errors , one can use this purification protocol to purify states with @xmath51 and reach a fidelity as close to one as we please .",
    "scheme ii @xcite is governed by a similar map .",
    "the main difference is that at the end of each step the resulting state is brought into werner form , that is the three diagonal elements @xmath52 are made equal to @xmath53 .",
    "therefore one can concentrate on the first diagonal element , the fidelity @xmath54 , only .",
    "the fidelity after the @xmath42th purification step is then given by @xmath55 as ( [ mapox ] ) , this map has an attractive fixed point at @xmath56 , and all @xmath57 are attracted to it .      in practice , while performing the purification protocols errors will occur , in the local operation as well as in the measurements .",
    "the imperfections in the local operations can be accounted for by substituting the action of the superoperator @xmath24 in eq.([pxideal ] ) by the action of some other completely positive , trace preserving linear map .",
    "the errors in the measurements will be related to the following fact : in practice , the outcomes @xmath58 will be ultimately attributed to the presence / absence of clicks in some kind of detectors . due to imperfections , the projection operators ( or , more generally , povms ) corresponding to these clicks",
    "are not exactly the same as the ideal ones ( [ pxideal ] ) .",
    "consequently , the probabilities of the outcomes @xmath58 as well as the state remaining after the measurement will differ from the ideal ones . in general , we can describe both these erroneous operations and measurements in terms of a single completely positive linear map @xmath59 which does not necessarily preserve the trace ( we will use tildes in the case in which there are errors to distinguish them for the error free case ) .",
    "that is , if the two pairs are initially in the state @xmath23 , a purification step yields the outcome @xmath26 with a probability @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the state of the pair after the measurement is [ rhoi ] _",
    "thus , as before , the maps @xmath61 completely characterize each purification step .",
    "we characterize the errors by a single parameter as follows : [ delta ] : = _",
    "x=0,1 d(p_x,_x ) , where @xmath62 denotes a distance between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the explicit form of this distance is given in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) below .",
    "we emphasize that for a given set ",
    "up , one can ( in principle ) perform local measurements to completely characterize @xmath65 , and therefore obtain the value of @xmath3 experimentally @xcite .",
    "the error parameter @xmath3 has a clear physical meaning since it measures the distance between the ideal process and the erroneous one .",
    "we would like to remark here that due to the fact that there are measurements and postselection involved in the process , we have to work with maps @xmath35 that do not preserve the trace . in section iii",
    "we discuss why it is adventageous to use those maps instead of trace preserving maps .",
    "some remarks concerning the adopted description of errors are in order : we envision @xmath66 as the reduced dynamics of the two entangled pairs coupled to some environment .",
    "as shown in @xcite reduced dynamics need in general not be completely positive ( not even positive ) on the whole system space . in taking the imperfect system dynamics to be completely positive",
    "we do ( as discussed in @xcite ) essentially assume that there is _ no initial entanglement _ between the system and any environment to which it might be coupled during gate operations .",
    "there may be , however , initial entanglement of the system with another environment that is not affected by the gate operations . as in the error ",
    "free purification schemes @xcite we also assume the two pairs that participate in a purification step to be disentangled from each other .",
    "once we have defined a parameter that characterizes the errors at each purification step , we can analyze the whole purification procedure @xcite in the non ideal case . in order to do that",
    ", we define @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the density operator after the @xmath42th purification step .",
    "we are particularly interested in the fidelity at each step @xmath69 . in section",
    "iv we show that for suitable initial conditions @xmath70 and error parameter @xmath3 [ ineq ] a^0_n a_n , a^1_n b_n , ( n=1,2 ,  ) where [ nlmap ] [ nlmapa ] a_n+1 & = & + [ nlmapb ] b_n+1 & = & and @xmath71 , @xmath72 . for scheme",
    "i only the fidelity @xmath73 and therefore the bound ( [ nlmapa ] ) with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath75 is relevant .",
    "equations ( [ nlmap ] ) define a non  linear map that can be iterated to yield a lower bound for the attainable fidelity @xmath76 which depends on the value of @xmath3 . in the following we will analyze the map ( [ nlmap ] ) .",
    "let us first concentrate on the fixed points @xmath77 of this map , and consider in particular scheme ii . in fig .  1 ( solid line ) we have plotted @xmath78 as a function of the error parameter @xmath3 . for small values of @xmath79",
    "there are three fixed points . the ones with largest and the smallest value of @xmath78 are attractive , whereas the intermediate one is a saddle point attractive in one direction and repulsive in the others . for larger values of @xmath3 , only the smallest one survives .",
    "this means that for the appropriate initial values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 if @xmath82 one increases the fidelity using the purification protocol ii to a value larger than the one given by the right wing of the appropriate curve of fig .  1 .",
    "for example , for @xmath83 one can obtain a fidelity @xmath84 .",
    "now , let us analyze for which initial conditions @xmath85 the map converges to the fixed point with the largest @xmath78 , i.e. , for which purification is possible . in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted in the @xmath86 parameter space the curve ( separatrix ) between the stable regions for several values of @xmath3 ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . for any initial value @xmath85 lying to the right of each curve , the map will converge to the corresponding fixed point ( asterisks in the plot ) .",
    "for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 in the plot ) , for example , one can purify from values of @xmath91 up to values of @xmath92 ; for @xmath93 , one can reach @xmath94 starting from @xmath95 .",
    "the results show that the error threshold for purification is much less restrictive than the one for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath96 a finite dimensional complex hilbert space and by @xmath97 the complex banach space of linear operators @xmath98 with the trace norm @xmath99 ( as usual , @xmath100 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath101 the convex set of positive linear operators @xmath5 acting on @xmath96 with @xmath102 , and by @xmath103 the set of completely positive linear maps @xmath104 fulfilling [ posit ] ||p()|| |||| for positive operators , the trace norm simply coincides with the trace , and therefore eq .  ( [ posit ] ) is equivalent to ( ) 1 .    given two completely positive maps @xmath105 , we define their distance [ dis ] d(p , ) = _ c(h ) || p ( ) - ( ) || .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath106 is indeed a distance by using the fact that the trace norm is a norm .    with this definition",
    ", we can characterize the errors by using the parameter @xmath3 as defined in ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the motivation for this definition with respect to other possible definitions is that it easily gives lower bounds even for physical processes where there are measurements and post selection ( as it is in the case of entanglement purification , cf .",
    "next section ) , i.e. when the map describing the physical process is not trace preserving . on the other hand",
    "( although we will not use this property here ) it allows to easily bound the distance between processes which are composed of several individual processes in terms of the distances between the individual processes themselves ( see next subsection ) .",
    "one can define other distances between trace preserving maps : for example , one can consider the map @xmath107 that transforms @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is given in ( [ rhoi ] ) in terms of the linear maps @xmath61 .",
    "this new map , although trace preserving , is nonlinear .",
    "if one defines distances between @xmath107 and the corresponding ( trace - preserving ) ideal map @xmath110 , problems related to the non  linearity arise : for example , it can happen that while the distance @xmath3 between the linear maps @xmath111 is very small , the similarly defined distance between the non  linear maps @xmath112 is of the order of 1 , which makes the definition useless to derive bounds .",
    "the reason is that low probability processes get `` magnified '' by the normalization and then dominate the maximization used to define the distance .",
    "one can still define other error parameters to find sharper bounds to the fidelity in entanglement purification .",
    "however , by increasing the number of parameters one does not gain too much and the bounds become more complicated to analyze . on the other hand , @xmath113 @xcite , which would allow us to use @xmath106 in processes for which the system in which we perform operations and measurements is entangled with another system , without having to include the other system in the error analysis .",
    "this may be useful , for example , in quantum computation where operations are performed on single qubits that are entangled with many other qubits . in that case",
    ", one can define other distances , as it is done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case , in quantum communication if we can bound the fidelity when the system is not entangled , we can automatically derive a bound for the entanglement fidelity @xcite .",

    "there are , however , two complications : first , the eventual fate of a point @xmath86 depends on both @xmath186 and @xmath192 .",
    "second , we need to make sure that the conditions ( [ cov1 ] ) are fulfilled in every step of the iteration , otherwise it is no longer valid to interpret @xmath172 as bounds of the actual values @xmath196 . for both of these complications",
    "we have been unable to find complete analytical answers .",
    "therefore we first give the numerical results before mentioning partial analytical solutions .",
    "numerical calculations show that the physically meaningful set @xmath197 is divided in two parts by a curve passing through the intermediate fixed point , the separatrix ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "points to the right of that curve converge to the upper fixed point , points to the left towards the lower one .",
    "moreover the points to the right do all satisfy the conditions ( [ cov1 ] ) and so do the orbits of all these points .",
    "for all ensembles described by density matrices with diagonal elements @xmath198 in that region , @xmath199 as defined in ( [ nlmap ] ) provide lower and upper bounds for the respective fidelities after @xmath42 purification steps . for initial values to the left of the separatrix",
    "our approach allows no statement .",
    "the case @xmath157 in fig .",
    "2 indicates , how many `` good '' points our worst - case - consideration misses : as shown in @xcite the exact border of the set of purifyable points in the @xmath86-plane is given by the straight line @xmath200 .    for a subset of the points to the right of the separatrix it is easy to _ prove _ convergence : all the points @xmath86 fulfilling @xmath201 , and @xmath202 converge to the upper fixed point @xmath203 ( except for @xmath204 , of course ) .",
    "* proof : * the proof proceeds in four steps .",
    "the main tool is the monotonic dependence of @xmath205 on @xmath186 and @xmath192 .",
    "( it is easily checked by calculation , that the coordinates of the intermediate fixed point satisfy the conditions ( [ cov1 ] ) for all @xmath3 so that monotonicity holds . )",
    "\\(i ) consider @xmath86 in the set enclosed by the two curves @xmath189 and @xmath206 ( ep .  [ bfix ] , cf .",
    "3 ) . for these points",
    ", we have for all @xmath42 @xmath207 since @xmath156 and @xmath74 are bounded by the coordinates of the upper and intermediate fixpoints , they form monotonical , bounded sequences and converge therefore . since @xmath156 increases and @xmath74 decreases , they converge towards @xmath208 .",
    "\\(ii ) similarly it is seen that all points @xmath209 do converge to the fixed point `` from above '' .",
    "\\(iii ) now , consider a point @xmath210 below the curve @xmath189 .",
    "let us call a point @xmath86 _ better _ than @xmath211 , if @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "monotonicity implies that if @xmath86 better than @xmath211 then this will also be true for the images of these points after one iteration of the dynamical system .",
    "now compare @xmath214 with @xmath215 between the curves but with the same @xmath186 as @xmath214 , and with @xmath216 .",
    "clearly , @xmath214 is better than @xmath217 but worse than @xmath218 . since both @xmath217 and @xmath218 converge towards the upper fixpoint , so does @xmath214 .",
    "\\(iv ) a similar argument applies , if we compare a point @xmath219 with @xmath220 between the curves and @xmath221 below the curves : the primed points converge to the upper fixpoint , and thus @xmath86  being better than @xmath222 and worse than @xmath223 ",
    "does so , too .",
    "this completes the proof.@xmath121",
    "the entanglement purification protocols @xcite in the presence of errors in gate operations and measurements have been investigated .",
    "the errors are quantified by a single parameter derived from the trace norm .",
    "we have shown that these protocols allow to increase the fidelity of the entanglement even if implemented with imperfect quantum gates and measurements , as long as the errors are below a threshold of the order 1% .",
    "we derived a non  linear map to calculated a lower bound for the fidelity after @xmath42 purification steps .",
    "a polynomial is given , the root of which gives a lower bound for the asymptotically attainable fidelity .",
