    "( fixed points have been suppressed in the factors . )",
    "this factorization is easily verified to be minimal transitive .",
    "minimal transitive factorizations have been very well studied , with much of this attention stemming from the fact that they serve geometers as combinatorial models for branched coverings of the sphere by the sphere . in this context ,",
    "transitivity guarantees connectedness of the associated covering , while minimality implies the covering surface is the sphere .",
    "for further information on these connections see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the focus of this paper is the class of * cycle factorizations * , by which we mean minimal transitive factorizations , such as   above , whose factors are all cycles of length at least two . in particular , given a composition @xmath1 and a sequence @xmath40 of nonnegative integers ( called the * cycle index * ) , we wish to determine the number @xmath41 of cycle factorizations of any fixed permutation @xmath34 into exactly @xmath2 2-cycles , @xmath3 3-cycles , _",
    "etc_. our results will be formulated in terms of the generating series @xmath42 here , and throughout , @xmath43 denotes the total number of factors in any factorization counted by @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a vector of indeterminates .",
    "the structure of generic cycle factorizations is not well understood and , aside from explicit evaluations of @xmath46}({\\mathbf{{\\mathbf{i}}}})}$ ] ( see  @xcite and theorem  [ thm : springer ] of this paper ) , little work has been done on their enumeration .",
    "however , a significant effort has been directed toward a natural specialization of this problem , which is to count what we call * @xmath17-cycle factorizations*. these are cycle factorizations whose factors are all @xmath17-cycles for some fixed @xmath17 .",
    "the case @xmath47 ( transposition factors ) is particularly important geometrically .",
    "counting factorizations of permutations is known as the _ hurwitz problem _ , and dates back to hurwitz s original investigations into the classification of almost simple ramified coverings of the sphere by the sphere  @xcite .",
    "the following formula , suggested but not completely proved by hurwitz himself , gives the number of factorizations of any permutation of cycle type @xmath48 : @xmath49 although it has been extensively studied from various points of view , ranging from analytic to combinatorial ( see @xcite , for example ) , no purely bijective proof of this striking enumerative formula is known .",
    "such a proof would be of tremendous interest as it could provide further insight into the underlying geometry .",
    "this is particularly true in light of a recent celebrated result of ekedahl , lando , shapiro , and vainshtein  @xcite that identifies the enumeration of factorizations ( _ i.e. _ almost simple coverings ) with the evaluation of certain hodge integrals , objects of great interest in the intersection theory of the moduli space of curves .",
    "see  @xcite for further details on these fascinating connections .",
    "indeed , the ultimate goal of our approach to factorization problems is a full combinatorialization of hodge integrals .    for arbitrary @xmath50 ,",
    "counting factorizations has not been as thoroughly examined and appears quite difficult .",
    "substantial progress was made in  @xcite , where generating series formulations for the number of such factorizations of permutations with up to three cycles are given .",
    "in particular , letting @xmath51 denote the series obtained by specializing @xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 , it is shown there that @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] ( which depends on @xmath17 ) is the unique series satisfying @xmath59 a more complicated expression for @xmath60 is also given in terms of @xmath61 , but the calculations necessary to evaluate @xmath51 for @xmath62 become intractable .",
    "there is a natural equivalence relation on cycle factorizations induced by permitting commutations of disjoint factors .",
    "that is , we say two cycle factorizations are * equivalent * if one can be obtained from the other by repeatedly exchanging adjacent factors that are disjoint in the sense that no symbol is moved by both . for example , the following factorizations are equivalent : @xmath63 let @xmath64 denote the number of inequivalent cycle factorizations of @xmath34 with cycle index @xmath65 .",
    "we shall study these numbers through the series @xmath66 as before , let @xmath67 be the restricted series counting inequivalent factorizations obtained from @xmath68 by setting @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 in @xmath68 .",
    "the problem of counting factorizations up to commutation can apparently be traced back to stanley , who originally posed it in the context of factorizations . the first result along these lines came from eidswick  @xcite and longyear  @xcite , who proved ( independently ) that the number of inequivalent factorizations of the full cycle @xmath69 is the generalized catalan number @xmath70 longyear s approach involved commutation of factorizations into a canonical form .",
    "this led to the following cubic functional equation for the generating series @xmath71 , from which   is easily deduced : @xmath72 springer  @xcite later generalized longyear s argument to obtain an explicit formula for @xmath73}({\\mathbf{i}})}}$ ] .",
    "his result is recovered here as theorem  [ thm : ispringer ] . also see  @xcite for an alternative derivation of the number of inequivalent factorizations of a full cycle .",
    "more recently , goulden , jackson , and latour  @xcite counted inequivalent factorizations of any permutation @xmath74}$ ] , proving that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined by  .",
    "their method again relies on commutation to canonical form , with the additional aid of a clever combinatorial construction and an intricate inclusion - exclusion argument .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to introduce a new technique in the enumeration of both cycle factorizations and their equivalence classes under commutation .",
    "we believe our approach to be of interest for two principal reasons : first , it conveniently allows one to ignore the fine detail of factorizations ( _ i.e. _ element - wise analysis ) and focus on the grander structure , and second , it makes clearer the structural parallels between the enumeration of factorizations and their equivalence classes .",
    "what follows is a brief overview of the paper highlighting our main results .    in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] the reader is introduced to various constructs and conventions that are used extensively throughout the paper .",
    "our analysis of cycle factorizations then begins in section  [ sec : cyclefacts ] , where we describe a graphical representation that allows   to be viewed as a generating series for a special class of labelled planar maps .",
    "cycle factorizations of full cycles are then seen to correspond with particularly simple maps , namely _ cacti _ , which are a natural generalization of trees .",
    "this leads to the recovery of a known explicit formula for the number @xmath46}({\\mathbf{i}})}$ ] of cycle factorizations of a full cycle ( see theorem  [ thm : springer ] ) .",
    "it also marks our first encounter with the series @xmath77[[x]]$ ] defined as the unique solution of the functional equation @xmath78 where @xmath79[[z]]$ ] is given by @xmath80 clearly @xmath81 is a generalization of the series @xmath61 given by  , making it no surprise that it plays a central role in our analysis . in particular , we shall present a graphical decomposition of maps ( called _ pruning _ ) that identifies an algebraic dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath81 .",
    "this is the content of theorem  [ thm : cactuspruning ] , and is the centerpiece of our method . by exploiting the pruning decomposition",
    "we deduce following extension of   to factorizations of arbitrary cycle index .",
    "[ thm : mainthm1 ] let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be defined as above and , for @xmath83 , set @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath85    in the end , our proof of theorem  [ thm : mainthm1 ] still rests on an _ ad hoc _ enumeration that we have not been able to generalize .",
    "thus a formulation of @xmath52 for arbitrary @xmath86 remains out of reach .",
    "we believe that it will be more tedious than difficult to extend our methods to arrive at an expression for @xmath87 , but this has only yet been done in a special case .",
    "we comment further on these developments in  [ ssec : furtherresults ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : inequiv ] we turn to the enumeration of cycle factorizations up to the equivalence defined in   [ ssec : equivalence ] . by modifying our graphical representation of cycle factorizations to allow for commutations of adjacent factors ,",
    "we are led to springer s formula  @xcite for the number of inequivalent cycle factorizations of a full cycle ( theorem  [ thm : ispringer ] ) .",
    "we discover that the unique solution @xmath88[[x]]$ ] of the functional equation @xmath89 plays a role directly analogous to that of @xmath81 in the enumeration of ordered cycle factorizations . again",
    "we develop a pruning decomposition ( theorem  [ thm : inequivpruning ] ) from which we deduce the following generalization of   to factorizations of arbitrary cycle index .",

    "again , we have been unable to extend theorem  [ thm : mainthm2 ] to give a general expression for @xmath68 .",

    "we warn the reader that some of these conventions are nonstandard .",

    "we write @xmath99 for the cyclic list with representative sequence @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath101 . some liberties will be taken with this notation ; for instance , when considering the list @xmath102 , we adopt the convention that @xmath103 is to be interpreted as @xmath104 , while @xmath105 , _ etc . _",

    "a map is * 2-coloured * if its faces have been painted black and white so every edge is incident with both a black face and a white face ( so no two similarly coloured faces are adjacent ) .",

    "we now use the pruning of marked polymaps to prove theorem  [ thm : mainthm2 ] . as mentioned in the introduction , this theorem generalizes the main result of  @xcite , and it is worth noting that the intricate inclusion - exclusion argument used there is avoided entirely by our method . in particular , the following lemma ( which is a routine exercise in exponential generating series ) is seen to be a more natural source of the logarithm appearing in  .
