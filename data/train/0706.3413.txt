    "it is quite often that the @xmath7 transition - metal oxides with orbital degeneracy display an orbital ordering associated with lattice distortions ( of the jahn - teller type).@xcite in contrast , @xmath6 and @xmath8 transition - metal compounds rarely show this , @xcite mainly due to the delocalized character of the @xmath9 electrons .",
    "it was therefore a surprise when the @xmath6-orbital ordering and the orbitally driven spin - singlet dimerization were found in the ruthenate la@xmath1ru@xmath0o@xmath10.@xcite moreover , the fascinating superstructure of the spinel cuir@xmath0s@xmath1 ( ref . ) was explained in terms of the concept of orbitally - induced peierls state ( associated with the partially occupied ir @xmath8",
    "orbitals).@xcite    very recently,@xcite the magnetic behavior of the layered cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 was investigated , and the in - plane ferromagnetism ( fm ) of the @xmath11=1/2 ag@xmath4 ions was evidenced by magnetization and inelastic neutron scattering measurements , in sharp contrast to the structurally analogous high-@xmath12 cuprates .",
    "moreover , analysis of the structural data suggests that cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is @xmath6 orbitally - ordered , and it was proposed that such orbital ordering may be the origin of the observed fm .",
    "cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 was first synthesized in 1974 by odenthal , paus , and hoppe,@xcite and it received , as well as other silver fluorides , attention due to pursuit of superconductivity in transition - metal compounds other than the cuprates.@xcite cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is a structural analog of the parent compound of cuprate superconductors , la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( agf@xmath0 @xmath13 cuo@xmath0 sheet ) , and both have the @xmath11=1/2 divalent transition - metal cations ( ag@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath13 cu@xmath4 @xmath14 ) and isoelectronic anions ( f@xmath15 @xmath13 o@xmath16 ) .",
    "it is well known that la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is a mott insulator of charge - transfer type with two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetism ( af ) . upon hole doping ( like ba substitution for la ) it is tuned into a superconductor , and , its high - temperature normal state being a paramagnetic metal , has the holes predominantly on the antibonding @xmath17 band.@xcite silver fluorides have similar electronic band structure , namely the ag - f @xmath17 antibonding character in the vicinity of the fermi level.@xcite moreover , the ag - f bonding is substantially covalent in the ag@xmath4 and ag@xmath18 fluorides , and thus holes might be doped into the f @xmath19 band , which is unprecedented in the chemistry of transition - metal compounds . as a result , an interesting new perspective is opened for the design of a novel family of metallic , perhaps even superconducting materials based on silver fluorides.@xcite    subsequent to the finding of fm in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1,@xcite its electronic structure was studied by kasinathan @xmath20 @xmath21@xcite and dai @xmath20 @xmath22@xcite both using density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "kasinathan @xmath20 @xmath21 found the fm , due to importance of the ag - f covalency , to be itinerant in character , and substantial magnetic moment on the fluorine ions as result of a stoner instability enhanced by hund s coupling.@xcite dai @xmath20 @xmath21 suggested that the fm originates from the spin polarization of the doubly occupied @xmath23 band , which is induced by the @xmath24 orbital interaction through the ag - f - ag bridges.@xcite both groups of authors dealt with the tetragonal lattice@xcite and obtained a nearly half - metallic solution in the fm state , and used it to explain the origin of fm in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1.@xcite however , in reality cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is an insulator with a relatively large energy gap ( lilac color ) and has a distorted orthorhombic lattice,@xcite and thus the above studies of the fm are insufficient .",
    "more recently , kan @xmath20 @xmath21@xcite performed pseudopotential dft calculations for the orthorhombic structure and they obtained an orbitally ordered solution ( in contrast to refs . and ) . however , their calculations underestimated the in - plane distortion and strongly overestimated both the in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic coupling strengths .",
    "moreover , they did not investigate the tetragonal structure .",
    "therefore , their results do not allow to reach solid conclusions .    in the present work , we re - investigate theoretically the electronic structure of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 and the origin of its fm , by carrying out a comparative study of the orthorhombic and tetragonal lattices of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 using dft total - energy calculations .",
    "we find that the orthorhombic phase is more stable and it is insulating with suppressed ag - f bandwidths .",
    "the inherent lattice distortion is accompanied by the ag @xmath6-orbital ordering , and this orbital ordering readily accounts for the observed fm ( similar results were also obtained recently by hao @xmath25@xcite ) .",
    "this picture holds in the presence of a moderate correlation of the ag @xmath6 electrons .",
    "the resulting picture of an orbital ordering and of a ferromagnetic insulating state of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is thus very similar to that of an isoelectronic and isostructural compound k@xmath0cuf@xmath1.@xcite",

    "this orbitally - polarized hole state in the insulating solution is associated with the large distortion of the ag - f bonds of 0.33    ( 2.44    along the @xmath39-axis versus 2.11    along the @xmath40-axis , and 2.11    along the @xmath55-axis , all in a local coordinate system),@xcite which leads to a pronounced crystal - field splitting and suppressed bandwidths . as a result ,",
