    "recent interest in the spin structure of the proton , neutron , and deuteron and advances in experimental techniques have led to a number of experiments concerned with deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of polarized leptons on various polarized targets . among these are the e143 experiment at slac @xcite and the smc collaboration at cern @xcite , which used polarized hydrogen and deuterium , the e154 experiment at slac @xcite and the hermes collaboration at desy @xcite , which used polarized @xmath3he , and the hermes experiment @xcite , which used polarized hydrogen @xcite .    a new material , deuterized lithium @xmath0lid , has recently emerged as a source of polarized deuterium in the e155/e155x experiments at slac . in comparison with the previously used target materials , @xmath0lid shows a better dilution factor ( polarizability ) and radiation resistance ( durability ) @xcite .",
    "the deuteron spin structure function @xmath2 was studied with the use of the polarized @xmath0lid target by the slac e155 experiment for the first time@xcite .    in order to extract the spin structure functions of the proton , neutron , and deuteron from the data on polarized dis on nuclear targets one needs to account for nuclear effects .",
    "these effects can be divided into incoherent and coherent contributions .",
    "the incoherent nuclear effects result from the scattering of the incoming lepton on each individual nucleon , nucleon resonance , or virtual meson in the nucleus .",
    "the incoherent nuclear effects are present at all bjorken @xmath1 .",
    "spin depolarization , the presence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , fermi motion , binding , and off - shell effects are examples of incoherent nuclear effects .    in the target rest frame ,",
    "coherent nuclear effects arise from the interaction of the incoming lepton with two or more nucleons of the target .",
    "the coherent nuclear effects are typically concentrated at low values of bjorken @xmath1 .",
    "nuclear shadowing at @xmath4 and subsequent antishadowing at @xmath5 are examples of coherent effects .",
    "it is important to stress that the transition between the shadowing and antishadowing regions is not well - understood .",
    "thus , the bjorken @xmath1 , where the transition occurs , is known only approximately .",
    "for example , the nmc unpolarized dis data on nuclei @xcite suggests that , depending on the nuclear target , the transition takes place between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for @xmath0li and at @xmath7 for @xmath8ca . ]",
    "consequently , one can reliably estimate the effect of nuclear shadowing only at @xmath9 .    in case of polarized dis on nuclear targets ,",
    "the major nuclear effect is spin depolarization .",
    "this effect manifests itself as a decrease of the effective polarization of the nucleons due to the presence of higher partial waves in bound - state nuclear wave functions @xcite .",
    "the effective polarization @xmath10 of a nucleon is introduced as the probability that the nucleon carries spin of the fully polarized nuclear target .",
    "@xmath10 can be reliably calculated by the standard methods of nuclear physics .    as an example",
    ", one can consider the proton and neutron effective polarizations in deuteron , defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the probability of the @xmath13-wave in the deuteron ground - state wave function .",
    "one finds that @xmath14=0.913 , using the paris nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite , and @xmath14=0.936 , using the bonn nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .    as another example , one can consider the effective polarizations of the neutron and protons in @xmath3he .",
    "calculations of the @xmath3he bound - state wave function with various nucleon - nucleon potentials and three - nucleon forces yield significant probabilities of higher partial waves .",
    "the probabilities result in the following effective polarizations : @xmath15 for the neutron and @xmath16 for each proton @xcite .    in case of the target of @xmath0lid , polarized deuterium originates from free deuterons",
    "d as well as from @xmath0li since the latter can be visualized as an alpha particle plus a polarized deuteron . treating @xmath0li as a cluster @xmath17 ,",
    "the faddeev equation for the three - body system can be used to calculate the properties of the ground - state wave function of @xmath0li .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the effective polarizations of the proton and neutron in polarized @xmath0li are @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in addition to this effect , an isotopic analysis of the @xmath0lid target revealed that 4.6% of lithium is @xmath19li and that 2.4% of deuterium is hydrogen @xcite . and ,",
    "finally , the effective polarization of @xmath0li was measured to be 97% of the polarization of the free deuterons in @xmath0lid @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath0lid is fully polarized with @xmath20 , the effective polarization of deuterium in @xmath0lid is @xmath21 where the first ( second ) value is for the bonn ( paris ) nucleon - nucleon potential .    also , in order to extract the precise shape of the proton , neutron , or deuteron spin structure function @xmath22 from the dis data on polarized nuclear targets , one must account for the fermi motion , binding , and off - shell effects .",
    "however , calculations for deuterium @xcite and for @xmath3he @xcite indicate that these effects are negligible at @xmath23 .",
    "thus , with good accuracy one can neglect them while extracting @xmath2 from the @xmath0lid data at @xmath23 .",
    "the importance of the deuteron spin depolarization in @xmath0lid , see eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) , is well - established and has been taken into account in analyzing the data of the e155 experiment @xcite .",
    "however , since some of the data covers the interval of small bjorken @xmath1 , @xmath24 , corrections should be made for nuclear shadowing and antishadowing .",
    "as explained above , this region of @xmath1 corresponds to the transition between the regimes of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing , which is known very poorly at the moment .",
    "thus , one can not estimate the effect of nuclear shadowing at @xmath25 until a theory of antishadowing exists .",
    "consequently , in this work , we estimate the effect of nuclear shadowing in polarized dis on @xmath0lid and its influence on the extraction of @xmath2 at very small bjorken @xmath1 only , @xmath26 . our analysis is applicable only to the lowest e155 point @xmath27=0.015 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the polarization of @xmath0lid is formed by the effective polarizations of deuterons , @xmath0li , protons , and @xmath19li . neglecting the fermi motion , binding , and off - shell effects",
    ", the spin structure function of @xmath0lid @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 eq .",
    "( [ cnvl ] ) assumes that the admixtures of hydrogen and @xmath19li to @xmath0lid are 100% and 97% polarized , respectively .",
    "( [ cnvl ] ) neglects the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing corrections .",
    "their importance in unpolarized and polarized dis at small bjorken @xmath1 is well - understood ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in the laboratory reference frame ,",
    "nuclear shadowing arises from the interaction of the incoming lepton with two and more nucleons of the target .",
    "these multiple interactions decrease total inclusive cross sections in unpolarized dis as well as spin asymmetries in polarized dis .",
    "the latter fact results in a decrease of @xmath28 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denote the shadowing corrections for the corresponding spin structure functions .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ shad ] ) describes the @xmath0lid spin structure function @xmath28 and the corrections associated with nuclear shadowing at small bjorken @xmath1 , @xmath34 .",
    "is usually estimated as the bjorken @xmath1 , when the coherence length @xmath35 is equal to 1.7 fm , the average internucleon distance in nuclei . ]",
    "the amount of nuclear shadowing in eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) is expected to be significant for two reasons .",
    "firstly , shadowing corrections to the spin dependent structure functions @xmath22 are about twice as large as to the spin - averaged structure functions @xmath36 @xcite . secondly ,",
    "shadowing corrections are larger for heavier nuclei .",
    "since almost half of the polarized deuterons in @xmath0lid originate from @xmath0li , where the nuclear shadowing correction is significant , the shadowing corrections to @xmath37 are larger than to @xmath2 .",
    "the shadowing corrections for the deuteron spin structure function were calculated in ref .",
    "it was found that the ratio @xmath38 is , for example , 5.8% at @xmath39 and 4.8% at @xmath40 .    within the framework developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can estimate the nuclear shadowing corrections to @xmath37 and @xmath41 using the gribov - glauber multiple scattering formalism along with simple ground - state wave functions of @xmath0li and @xmath19li .",
    "the details of this calculation are presented in appendix a.    the amount of nuclear shadowing depends on the effective cross section of the incoming photon - nucleon interaction @xmath42 , see eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "we have considered two representative examples of @xmath42 existing in the literature .",
    "these are the @xmath42 , which can be inferred from the two - phase model of nuclear shadowing of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the @xmath42 from the leading - twist diffraction - based approach to nuclear shadowing of ref .",
    "the main difference between the two models is that the model of @xcite accounts for antishadowing by requiring that the corresponding @xmath42 vanishes at @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] represents @xmath42 of @xcite as a solid line and @xmath42 of @xcite as a dashed line .    at very low bjorken @xmath1 , calculations with both @xmath42 predict a similar amount of nuclear shadowing .",
    "namely , at @xmath43 and @xmath44 gev@xmath45 , the ratio @xmath46 equals @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for @xmath42 given by the solid ( dashed ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "however , at larger @xmath1 , the deviation between the predictions made with the two scenarios for @xmath42 becomes larger . while , for example , at @xmath44 gev@xmath45 and @xmath40 , @xmath49 for the calculation with the @xmath42 of @xcite , @xmath50 for the calculation with the @xmath51 .",
    "note also that at even larger @xmath1 , @xmath52 , the calculations of nuclear shadowing bear a significant theoretical uncertainty . at those values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the coherent length of the incident photon becomes comparable to the average internucleon distance in nuclei and , as a consequence , nuclear shadowing rapidly decreases and gives up its place to antishadowing .",
    "the position and shape of this transition is unknown .",
    "thus , we estimate the effect of nuclear shadowing only at @xmath26 .    the shadowing correction to the @xmath19li spin structure function , given by eq .  ( [ m2 ] ) ,",
    "is not only sizable but also does not vanish when @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "thus , at those bjorken @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is small and , hence , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are small , the term proportional to @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) gives the dominant contribution to the shadowing correction to @xmath53 regardless the fact that @xmath19li is only a 4.6% admixture to @xmath0lid . at other @xmath1 , @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) can be safely neglected .",
    "nuclear shadowing at @xmath4 is followed by some antishadowing at @xmath5 , which enhances @xmath28 above the impulse approximation prediction of eq .",
    "( [ cnvl ] ) . in unpolarized dis",
    ", the presence of this enhancement for the nuclear structure function @xmath54 and the gluon and valence quark parton densities in nuclei has firm experimental evidence , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "however , since the understanding of the dynamics of nuclear antishadowing is lacking , it can only be treated in a model - dependent way .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of antishadowing was modelled using the baryon number and momentum sum rules for the nucleus .    in polarized dis",
    ", antishadowing is not constrained by the baryon number and momentum sum rules .",
    "however , in the particular case of polarized dis on mirror nuclei , one can use the generalization of the bjorken sum rule @xcite . using this approach ,",
    "the antishadowing contribution to the non - singlet nuclear spin structure function @xmath55 of @xmath3he @xcite and @xmath19li @xcite was modelled .",
    "the contribution was found to be of the order of @xmath56% for the @xmath57 system and of the order of @xmath58% for the @xmath59 system .",
    "the spread of the presented values is an indication of the uncertainty of where the transition between the shadowing and antishadowing regions takes place .",
    "although the generalization of the bjorken sum rule for @xmath0lid does not exist because @xmath0lid is an isoscalar , there is no reason for the absence of the antishadowing correction in dis on polarized @xmath0lid .",
    "while nuclear antishadowing is expected to modify the extraction of @xmath2 from the @xmath0lid data at @xmath60 , we do not estimate this effect and simply confine our predictions to the nuclear shadowing range of @xmath1 , @xmath61 .    in this work , the shadowing correction to @xmath28",
    "is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) at a fixed low scale @xmath62 gev@xmath45 . in order to find the modification of @xmath28 due to the nuclear effects at larger @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the qcd evolution with the input , described by eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) , should be used .",
    "based on the experience from the qcd evolution of unpolarized parton densities , it is expected that nuclear shadowing at small bjorken @xmath1 and high @xmath63 will decrease because of the contribution of the polarized gluons originating from the unshadowed , high @xmath1 , region at the initial evolution scale @xmath65 .",
    "now we are in position to give an estimate of the importance of the shadowing correction in eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) on the extraction of the deuteron spin structure function @xmath2 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath66 the deuteron spin structure function in the impulse approximation , i.e. @xmath66 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ cnvl ] ) where the coherent effects at small bjorken @xmath1 are neglected .",
    "the ratio of the theoretical prediction for @xmath67 , given by eq .",
    "( [ shad ] ) , when the effect of shadowing is present , and @xmath68 is presented as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is given by eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) . note that the ratio @xmath71 is equal to unity if the effect of nuclear shadowing is neglected .",
    "it is important to stress that the quantity , which is measured in polarized dis , is the spin asymmetry @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "then , in polarized dis , one obtains @xmath74 by multiplying @xmath72 by the spin - averaged structure function @xmath75 , which is also experimentally measured and , therefore , contains all nuclear effects .",
    "the latter fact is true for the e155 experiment data analysis @xcite , regardless the fact that it is not apparent from the e155 publication @xcite .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ master ] ) indeed describes the shadowing correction to the experimentally measured @xmath74 .    using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath31 and of appendix a for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the ratio @xmath71 of eq .",

    "the solid line is a result of the calculation without the @xmath33 term .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 with the @xmath33 term included is presented as the dotted line .",
    "these two curves are obtained using @xmath42 of the two - phase model of ref .",
    "the shadowing correction to @xmath41 was calculated by eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) . since the deuteron spin structure function parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite covers the region of @xmath76 , the contribution of the @xmath33 term starts at @xmath77 in fig .  [ fig : two ] .",
    "the calculation with the leading - twist @xmath42 of ref .",
    "@xcite is presented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] . in this case",
    ", the term proportional to @xmath33 does not contribute to the net shadowing correction to @xmath53 because @xmath42 is negligibly small at @xmath76 , where @xmath2 is parameterized and sizable .",
    "the results of the calculations with the paris and bonn nucleon - nucleon potentials are virtually the same . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , the paris nucleon - nucleon potential for @xmath12 is used .",
    "[ fig : two ] illustrates that , at small bjorken @xmath1 , @xmath78 , the shadowing correction is a slow function of @xmath1 , i.e. shadowing is saturated , and it works to increase @xmath66 by @xmath79% for the calculation with @xmath42 of @xcite and by @xmath80% for the calculation with @xmath42 of @xcite . at @xmath81",
    "the shadowing correction begins to decrease more rapidly as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "for the lowest data point of the e155 experiment @xmath27=0.015 , we predict that @xmath71 could still be as large as @xmath82% for the calculation with @xmath42 of @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that nuclear shadowing does modify the extraction of the deuteron spin structure function @xmath2 from @xmath53 at @xmath83 .",
    "note also that , since the e155 data @xcite indicates that @xmath84 is non - zero and quite significant at small bjorken @xmath1 , the shadowing correction @xmath31 is important for the extraction of the neutron spin structure function @xmath85 from @xmath2 .    while the present day data on @xmath2 is not accurate enough to demonstrate the importance of nuclear shadowing , in the future , when high precision data at even lower @xmath1 becomes available , the importance of nuclear effects typical for low bjorken @xmath1 can be unambiguously established .",
    "moreover , with high precision polarized dis data one can study the role played by polarized gluons . since , in unpolarized dis , nuclear shadowing in the gluon channel is expected to be 3 times larger than in the sea quark channel ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : one ] for the the corresponding @xmath42 ) , the shadowing correction to the polarized nuclear gluon parton density could be 3 times as large as the shadowing correction to the structure function @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the recent slac e155 experiment has used deuterized lithium @xmath0lid as a source of polarized deuterons in order to study the deuteron spin structure function @xmath2 at @xmath86 . since some of the data covers the region of small bjorken @xmath1 , @xmath87 , where nuclear shadowing and antishadowing play an important role , necessary corrections should be made .    in this work we considered nuclear shadowing in polarized dis on the @xmath0lid target and its effect on the spin structure function",
    "@xmath28 at small bjorken @xmath1 , @xmath26 .",
    "the previous analysis of polarized dis on deuterium , @xmath3he , and @xmath19li suggests that the effect of nuclear shadowing in the nuclear spin dependent structure functions @xmath88 is enhanced by a factor of two as compared to the spin averaged structure functions @xmath54 .",
    "the magnitude of the nuclear shadowing effect is represented using the ratio @xmath89 , see eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . while , in the absence of the shadowing corrections , the ratio @xmath89 equals unity , nuclear shadowing at @xmath43 increases the ratio above unity by @xmath79% for the calculation with the @xmath42 extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite and by @xmath80% for the calculation with @xmath42 of @xcite . for the lowest data point of the e155 experiment @xmath90=0.015 , the shadowing correction to the ratio",
    "@xmath89 could be as large as @xmath82% .",
    "therefore , nuclear shadowing does modify the extraction of @xmath2 from @xmath28 in the range of @xmath26 and , consequently , affects the extraction of @xmath85 from @xmath2 .",
    "further theoretical effort is required to understand the dynamical mechanism of antishadowing , which was not discussed in this work .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that the phenomenon of nuclear shadowing in polarized dis on nuclear targets is a genuine low @xmath1 nuclear effect , which should be treated on the equal footing with any other nuclear effect , such as , for instance , spin depolarization .",
    "i would like to thank mark strikman and anthony w. thomas for helpful comments and discussions and kazuo tsushima for pointing and discussing refs .",
    "this work was partially supported by the australian research council .",
