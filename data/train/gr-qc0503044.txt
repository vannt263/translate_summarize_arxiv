    "a compelling motivation for accurate computations of the gravitational radiation field generated by compact binary systems ( _ i.e. _ , made of neutron stars and/or black holes ) is the need for accurate",
    "_ templates _ to be used in the data analysis of the current and future generations of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors .",
    "it is indeed recognized that the _ inspiral _ phase of the coalescence of two compact objects represents an extremely important source for the ground - based detectors ligo / virgo , provided that their total mass does not exceed say 10 or 20 @xmath6 ( this includes the interesting case of double neutron - star systems ) , and for space - based detectors like lisa , in the case of the coalescence of two galactic black holes , if the masses are within the range between say @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    for these sources",
    "the _ post - newtonian _ ( pn ) approximation scheme has proved to be the appropriate theoretical tool in order to construct the necessary templates .",
    "a program started long ago with the goal of obtaining these templates with 3pn and even 3.5pn accuracy.pn for a term in the wave form or ( for instance ) the energy flux which is of the order of @xmath9 relatively to the lowest - order newtonian quadrupolar radiation .",
    "] several studies @xcite have shown that such a high pn precision is probably sufficient , not only for detecting the signals in ligo / virgo , but also for analyzing them and accurately measuring the parameters of the binary ( such high - accuracy templates will also be of great value for detecting massive black - hole mergers in lisa ) . the templates have been first completed through 2.5pn order , for both the phase @xcite and wave amplitude @xcite . the 3.5pn accuracy for the templates ( in the case where the compact objects have negligible intrinsic spins ) has been achieved more recently , in essentially two steps .    1 .   the first step has been to compute all the terms , in both the 3pn equations of motion , either in hamiltonian form @xcite or using harmonic coordinates @xcite , and the 3.5pn gravitational radiation field , using a multipolar wave generation formalism @xcite , by means of the hadamard self - field regularization @xcite , in short hr .",
    "( the 3.5pn terms in the equations of motion have been added in refs .",
    "however , a few terms were left undetermined by hadamard s regularization , which corresponds to some incompleteness of this regularization occurring at the 3pn order .",
    "these terms could be parametrized by some unknown numerical coefficients called _",
    "ambiguity parameters_. 2 .",
    "the second step has been to fix the values of the ambiguity parameters by means of dimensional regularization @xcite , henceforth abbreviated as dr .",
    "technically , dr is based on analytic continuation in the dimension of space @xmath10 .",
    "the ambiguity parameter @xmath11 entering the 3pn equations of motion has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite , with result @xmath12 .",
    "( this result has also been obtained with an alternative approach in refs .",
    "the three ambiguity parameters appearing in the 3pn gravitational radiation field will be shown in the present paper to have the following unique values @xmath13 as already announced in ref .",
    "the method we use for applying dr essentially consists in computing the _ difference _ between dr and some appropriately defined hadamard - type regularization called below the pure - hadamard - schwartz ( phs ) regularization .",
    "those results complete the determination of the 3.5pn - accurate phase evolution as it suffices to insert into the formulas of ref .",
    "@xcite the value for @xmath11 , together with the values given by ( [ xikappazeta ] ) .",
    "actually , this phase evolution depends only on @xmath11 and on the following particular combination of parameters , @xmath14 the present paper is devoted to the details of our dr computation of the ambiguity parameters , _ item _ ( 2 ) above , which has led to the values ( [ xikappazeta])([theta ] ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a summary of our method and a general discussion .",
    "let us emphasize that the values ( [ xikappazeta ] ) , which constitute the end result of the application of dr , have all been confirmed by alternative methods .",
    "our first independent check has been the confirmation of one particular combination of the ambiguity parameters , namely @xmath15 , which was shown to follow from the requirement that the 3pn mass dipole moment of the binary , computed in @xcite from the multipolar wave generation formalism , should agree with the 3pn center - of - mass position , known from the conservative part of the 3pn equations of motion in harmonic coordinates @xcite .",
    "secondly , we have also obtained the value of @xmath5 by considering the limiting physical situation of a _ boosted schwarzschild solution _ , corresponding to the case where the mass of one of the particles is exactly zero , and the other particle moves with uniform velocity @xcite .",
    "it can be argued from this calculation that the value of @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ xikappazeta ] ) is a consequence of the global poincar invariance of the multipolar wave generation formalism .",
    "thirdly , in sec .  [ secvii ] below , we shall be able to show that the value of @xmath4 is zero by a diagrammatic approach ( where the `` diagrams '' are taken in the sense of @xcite ) , showing that no dangerously divergent diagrams contributing to @xmath4 appear at this order .",
    "those checks altogether provide a confirmation , _ independent from dr _ , for all the parameters ( [ xikappazeta ] ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ secii ]",
    "we investigate the symmetric - trace - free ( stf ) multipole decomposition in @xmath0 dimensions for a scalar field with compact - support source . in section  [ seciii ]",
    "we generalize to @xmath0 dimensions the known results for the multipole expansion of the gravitational field and the definition of the source - type multipole moments .",
    "section  [ seciv ] is devoted to the explicit expressions of the source terms in the latter source multipole moments at the 3pn order in terms of a convenient set of retarded - like elementary potentials .",
    "then , in section  [ secv ] , we obtain a general formula for the difference between dr and hr ( in the phs variant of it ) .",
    "this difference is non - zero at the 3pn order because of the occurrence of poles in @xmath0 dimensions ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath16 ) . in section  [ secvi ]",
    "we deduce the ambiguity parameters from the dr regularization of the 3pn mass quadrupole moment , and we check that the 3pn mass dipole is in agreement with the known center - of - mass position deduced from the equations of motion . section  [ secvii ] deals with a direct computation of the pole part of the moments using diagrams , their renormalization using shifts of the world - lines , and the check that @xmath17 .",
    "in section  [ secviii ] we present an alternative derivation of the value of @xmath5 based on considering the physical situation of a single _ boosted _ point particle in @xmath0 dimensions ( the result agrees with the recent computation of the boosted schwarzschild solution in @xcite ) .",
    "a crucial input for the derivations we are going to perform in the present article is the multipolar expansion of solutions of flat space - time wave equations in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the flat dalembertian operator , using the signature `` mostly plus '' , _",

    "similarly , we define the scalar green functions as the solutions of @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath0-dimensional dirac distribution , such that @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 , the _ retarded _ green function takes the simple form @xmath29 because of the presence of the factor @xmath30 in ( [ green2 ] ) , it was convenient , when working in @xmath31 dimensions , to introduce a factor @xmath32 in front of the rhs s of ( [ boxphi ] ) and ( [ green1 ] ) .",
    "however , there is no analogous , universally simplifying factor in @xmath33 dimensions , so it is finally simpler to introduce no factors at all in ( [ boxphi])([green1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath33-dimensional retarded green function has no simple expression in @xmath34 space .",

    "@xmath39 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath40 the usual bessel function .",

    "in fact , the ambiguous integrals are those which exhibit some _ logarithmic _ divergencies , corresponding to the occurrence of poles in @xmath0 dimensions . as it turns out , the structure of the ambiguous terms is always of a simple and limited type , and can therefore be parametrized by means of a few arbitrary unknown numerical constants called the `` _ _ ambiguity parameters _ _ '' .",

    "( [ 4.1 ] ) is crucial to its validity .",

[ fig1 ] above , and ( iii ) that they entail the presence of genuine ambiguities at the 3pn level which can only be fixed by a matching calculation . if these statements were correct , that would mean not only that the basic `` effacement '' property ( modulo 5pn - level `` quadrupole - type '' additional terms to the effective action ) is incorrect , but also that the recent results , @xcite and this work , fixing all 3pn - level ambiguity parameters by dr are flawed .",
    "let us , however , indicate why we think that the claims ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) made in ref .",
    "@xcite are not correct .",
    "first , we mention that the addition of curvature - coupling terms of the type indicated in ( [ 6.31 ] ) has already been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered finite - size effects in tensor - scalar gravity . indeed , when gravity is partly mediated by a scalar excitation , the internal characteristics of compact objects are much less effaced than in the pure spin-2 case",
    ". in particular , the coupling to the spherical inertia moment @xmath875 can introduce extra couplings of the type of the curvature terms in ( [ 6.31 ] ) ( see @xcite ) together with several other scalar - dependent couplings .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the use of suitable field redefinitions can transform away the curvature couplings ( [ 6.31 ] ) into couplings explicitly involving the gradient of the scalar field , @xmath876 . as such a term does not exist in the pure spin-2 case",
    ", one sees that ref .",
    "@xcite proves that ( [ 6.31 ] ) can be field - redefined away .",
    "indeed , a simple way to see it is to recall that the first - order effect of a field redefinition of the metric @xmath877 is to modify the effective action by terms proportional to the einstein field equations , namely @xmath878 [ to simplify , we set the light velocity @xmath879 here and below ] .",
    "conversely , the ( _ a priori _ illicit ) use of the einstein field equations _ within an action _ is equivalent to a suitably defined field redefinition @xmath880 . applying this general result to ( [ 6.30 ] )",
    "we see that the curvature coupling terms ( [ 6.31 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath881 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath882 ) modulo a field redefinition @xmath883 of the type @xmath884 \\ , \\frac{\\delta^{(d ) } ( x^{\\lambda } - y_a^{\\lambda } ( s_a))}{\\sqrt{-g } } \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath885 , @xmath886 , @xmath887 , @xmath888 are linear combinations of the coefficients @xmath889 , @xmath890 entering ( [ 6.31 ] ) , namely @xmath891 , @xmath892 . after using",

    "such a pure contact term vanishes exactly , so that we have simply @xmath898 . [ as ref .",

    "we can give another ( partial ) confirmation of this result by looking at the form of the pole that ref .",

    "this confirms our conclusion that the claims ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) of @xcite are not correct because the terms they considered have no physical relevance .",
    "note also that the `` finite size '' effect ( [ 6.34 ] ) ( formally linked to a spherical inertia moment @xmath903 , as in the tensor - scalar case of @xcite ) is actually a 2pn - level term .",
    "if that term had created physical effects linked to the finite - size of the source , this would have meant that the 2.5pn equations of motion @xcite had missed some 2pn violation of the effacement properties . as a final comment",
