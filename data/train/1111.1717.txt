    "one crucial aspect of galaxy formation and evolution concerns the continuous infall of intergalactic gas onto galaxies . while it is clear that galaxies do accrete substantial amounts of gas from intergalactic space to power star formation , the exact way of _ how _ galaxies get their gas is still a matter of debate . in the conventional sketch of galaxy formation and evolution gas is falling into a dark matter ( dm ) halo and then is shock - heated to approximately the halo virial temperature ( a few @xmath14 k , typically ) , residing in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium with the dm potential well ( rees & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "the gas then cools slowly through radiation , condenses and settles into the center of the potential where it forms stars as part of a galaxy ( ` hot mode ' of gas accretion ) .",
    "it has been argued , however , that for smaller dm potential wells the infalling gas may radiate its acquired potential energy at much lower temperatures ( @xmath15 k , typically ) , so that one speaks of the ` cold mode ' of gas accretion ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ) . for the cold mode of gas accretion the star - formation rate of the central galaxy",
    "is directly coupled to its gas - accretion rate ( white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that for individual galaxies the dominating gas - accretion mode depends on the mass and the redshift ( e.g. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere@xmath16 et al.2005 ) .",
    "the general trend for @xmath17 is that the hot mode of gas accretion dominates for massive galaxies with dm - halo masses @xmath18 , while the cold accretion mode dominates for galaxies with smaller dm - halo masses ( e.g. , vandevoort et al.2011 ) .    independently of the theoretically expected gas - accretion mode of galaxies it is known since a long time that galaxies at low and high @xmath19 are surrounded by large amounts of neutral and ionized gas that partly originates in the igm .",
    "this material is complemented by neutral and ionized gas that is expelled from the galaxies as part of galactic fountains , galactic winds , and from merger processes ( see , e.g. , richter 2006 for a review ) .",
    "because the interplay between these circumgalactic gas components is manifold and the gas physics of such a turbulent multi - phase medium is complex , the circulation of neutral and ionized gas in the inner and outer halos currently can not be modeled in full detail in hydrodynamical simulations . to improve current models of galaxy - evolution models",
    "it is of imminent importance to quantify the amount of cool , neutral gas in and around galaxies from observations and search for observational strategies to separate metal - deficient infalling intergalactic gas from metal - enriched gaseous material that is circulating in the circumgalactic environment of galaxies as a result of fountain processes and galaxy mergers .    in the milky way and other , very nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , m31 ) , the infall of neutral gas onto to the disks",
    "can be observed directly by hi 21 cm observations of extraplanar gas clouds that move through the halos of these galaxies . for the milky way",
    ", the so - called `` high - velocity clouds '' ( hvcs ) represent the prime candidates for neutral gas that is being accreted onto the milky way disk .",
    "hvcs represent high - latitude gaseous structures ( located in the galactic halo ) observed in hi 21 cm emission at high radial velocities , @xmath20 kms@xmath4 ( e.g. ; wakker & van woerden 1998 ; richter 2006 ) .",
    "halo clouds with somewhat smaller radial velocities in the range @xmath21 kms@xmath4 are commonly referred to as `` intermediate - velocity clouds '' ( ivcs ) . throughout this paper , we will use the expression `` hvc '' for all neutral halo clouds ( including ivcs ) , if not otherwise stated .",
    "the total neutral gas mass of the milky way s hvc population is on the order of @xmath22 and the total accretion rate of neutral gas in the form of hvcs has been estimated to be @xmath23yr@xmath4 ( e.g. , wakker et al.2007 , 2008 ; wakker 2004 ) .",
    "also m31 exhibits a population of neutral halo clouds in a similar mass range ( for simplicity , hereafter also referred to as `` hvcs '' ; thilker et al.2004 ) . these observations , together with hi",
    "21 cm measurements of other nearby galaxies ( e.g. , sancisi et al.2007 ) , imply that hvcs represent a common phenomenon in the local universe .",
    "another important method to study the gaseous outskirts of galaxies and their relation to the cosmic web is the analysis of intervening absorption - line systems in optical und ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of qsos ( agn ) .",
    "qso absorption spectroscopy allows us to detect both neutral and ionized gas in the intergalactic medium and the halos of galaxies over eight orders of magnitude in column density and over more than 90 percent of the age of the universe .",
    "it is therefore a particularly sensitive method to explore the multi - phase nature of circumgalactic gas and its origin ( e.g. , bergeron & boiss 1992 ; steidel 1995 ; charlton & churchill 1998 ; ding et al.2005 ; richter et al.2011 ) .    in this paper , we combine hi 21 cm observations of the hvc population of milky way and m31 with 21 cm data of the local galaxy population and qso absorption - line measurements to study the three - dimensional distribution of ( partly ) neutral gas structures in the extended halos of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "while several previous studies have linked the galactic hvc population to intervening qso absorbers based on various arguments ( e.g. , blitz et al.1999 ; charlton , churchill & rigby 2000 ; pisano et al.2004 ; mshar et al.2007 ; schaye , carswell & kim 2007 ; narayanan et al.2008 ; richter et al.2009 ; stocke , keeney & danforth 2010 ; ribaudo et al.2011 ) , a detailed geometrical hvc model that connects key observables ( column densities , covering fractions , absorber number densities ) of hvcs and intervening absorbers with the gas - accretion rates of galaxies at low redshift has not been presented so far .",
    "the main goal of the present study is to model the _ radial _ distribution of hvc analogs in halos as a function of galaxy mass and size , determine their absorption - cross section at @xmath17 , and estimate the neutral - gas accretion rate of galaxies at low redshift .",
    "we refrain from including hi 21 cm observations of hvcs from other galaxies beyond the local group in our study , because these observations are strongly limited in sensitivity for detecting diffuse neutral halo gas ( e.g. , oosterloo et al.2007 ) . in addition",
    ", beam - smearing effects are known to smoothen out the true spatial distribution of individual halo clouds in more distant galaxies , so that the observed filling factor of hi 21 cm in these systems does not provide a realistic estimate for the absorption - cross section of this gas .",

    "in @xmath31 we generalize our hvc model for the local galaxy population , based on information on the hi mass function of low - redshift galaxies and the absorption - cross section of damped lyman @xmath32 absorbers ( dlas ) and lyman limit systems ( lls ) at @xmath17 . the relation between hvcs and intervening qso absorbers",
    "is discussed in @xmath33 .",

    ", complex c most likely is a cloud that is being accreted from the igm or from a satellite galaxy .",
    "the magellanic stream ( ms ) also covers an area of @xmath40 square - degree , but most likely has a distance as large as @xmath44 kpc ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "the ms represents a tidal feature expelled from the magellanic clouds as they move through the extended milky way halo . with its large distance and its stream - like shape",
    "the ms is clearly distinct from most of the other galactic hvcs , which predominantly are less extended and located at distances @xmath45 kpc from the disk ( wakker et al.1999 , 2007 , 2008 ; thom et al.2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "other prominent galactic hvcs are complex a , complex h , the anti - center cloud , and complexes wa@xmath46we .",
    "covering fractions and distances for some of these complexes ( as far as known ) are summarized in table 1 . because _ accurate _ distance information on the milky way hvcs is still limited , the total hi mass in hvcs and the hi mass - accretion rate ist not well constrained .",
    "the currently available information implies @xmath47 and @xmath48yr@xmath4 ( wakker et al.2007 ; 2008 ; wakker 2004 ) .",
    "the hi column densities in hvcs follow a column - density distribution function ( cddf ) in the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 for log @xmath10(hi@xmath51 ( lockman et al.2002 ) .      as has been shown by braun et al.(2009 )",

    "these authors detected more than 20 individual hvcs around m31 with hi column densities @xmath54 @xmath37 and estimated a total hi mass of the hvcs of @xmath55 ( see also thilker , braun & westmeier 2005 ) .",
    "in the left panel of fig.1 we show the distribution of hvcs around the m31 disk , based on the gbt hi 21 cm contour map presented by thilker et al.(2004 ) .",
    "the hvc population of m31 reaches out until @xmath27 kpc with a strongly decreasing hvc covering fraction towards larger radii .",
    "we assume @xmath56 kpc as distance for m31 ( mcconnachie et al.2005 ) , so that absolute distance estimates derived from angular coordinates are uncertain by @xmath57 percent .",
    "some interesting conclusions about the radial distribution of neutral gas around m31 can be drawn from this hvc distribution map .",

    "@xmath62 the parameter @xmath58 then was derived by comparing the area covered by hvc gas with the total ring area .",

    "the lack of data for the disk - halo interface region at @xmath71 kpc ( fig.1 , left panel ) rather indicates the incompleteness of the hvc map for small radii because of the confusion of neutral halo gas with the hi disk of m31 together with the stringent selection criteria defined by thilker et al . to unambiguously identify hvc features . in the milky way",
    ", the disk - halo interface at @xmath71 kpc is filled with large amounts of neutral gas that gives rise to 21 cm emission at intermediate and high velocities ( e.g. , wakker 2004 ) .",

    "the slope is very similar to the one derived for the milky way hvcs ( lockman et al.2002 ; previous subsection ) and is in good agreement with values derived for low - redshift qso hi absorption - line systems ( see sect.5.1 ) .",
    "to combine the observational information on the hvc population of the milky way and m31 we have developed the custom - written numerical code halopath , which is based on a simple geometrical model assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the code allows us to model the radial distribution of gas in the halos of galaxies , its mass distribution and its absorption - cross section from any given vantage point inside and outside the sphere . because of the unknown size distribution of hvcs",
    "we here do no attempt to model individual hi _ clouds _ as hvc analogs , but instead consider the volume - filling factor of neutral gas as main input parameter , from which all relevant physical quantities ( e.g. , projected covering fraction , hi column density , hi mass ) can be easily obtained and compared to observations .    to support the model with the necessary observational data , we assume that the hvc populations of the milky way and m31 are identical in a statistical sense ( same radial distribution and same volume filling factor of gas with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 ) . in view of the similarity of both galaxies in terms of morphology , mass , luminosity , etc .",

    ", @xmath81 is the volume - filling factor in the center of the sphere and @xmath79 is the scale height of the hvc population .",
    "another important parameter in our model is the mean hi volume density @xmath83 in the hvc gas , as @xmath83 together with @xmath113 determines the neutral gas mass in hvcs per radial bin (= radial volume element ) , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 as hydrogen mass and @xmath118 as a factor that corrects for the presence of helium and heavy elements in the gas .",

    "the parameters @xmath102(hi)@xmath120 and @xmath83 are constrained by 21 cm observations and ionization models of galactic ivcs and hvcs .",
    "note that in this study we do _ not _ model the gas physics in the halo clouds , but consider only the spatial distribution of neutral halo gas , its hi column density distribution , its total mass , and its infall rate .    to model the sky covering fraction of neutral gas from a vantage point _ inside _ the sphere ( i.e. , to model the projected neutral gas distribution in the milky way halo from the position of the sun ) we introduce additional constraints based on results from 21 cm observations of ivcs and hvcs .",
    "first , we only consider hi gas as neutral halo gas if it is located at vertical distances @xmath123 pc from the midplane of the disk ( whose orientation can be chosen in the model ) .",
    "second , we separate neutral halo gas close to the disk ( small @xmath19-heights ) from more distant halo clouds via the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this parameter enables us to distinguish between ivcs ( @xmath124 ) and hvcs ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath88 defines the infall velocity of the neutral halo gas ; @xmath88 can be a function of @xmath114 or @xmath19 , or can be chosen to be constant for ivcs and hvcs , respectively .",
    "the neutral gas ( mass ) accretion rate per radial bin then is given by @xmath126 .",
    "using our geometrical model we are able reproduce the observed properties of the hvc population of the milky way and m31 using appropriate values for the above discussed input parameters .",
    "our favorite model is summarized in table 2 . in this model ,",
    "the scale - height of the hvc population is @xmath127 kpc and the central volume - filling factor of neutral halo gas is @xmath128 .",
    "the errors have been determined numerically ; they reflect the 1@xmath129 error range of the exponential parameters for @xmath74 in m31 ( sect.2.2 ) . in our model",
    "we assume that ivcs and hvcs are separated at a @xmath19-height of @xmath130 kpc , in line with what is known about the distribution of ivc and hvc distances in the milky way halo ( wakker et al.2007 , 2008 ; thom et al.2006 , 2008 ) .    only these three parameters ( @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath130 )",
    "are required to reproduce the observed exponential decline of the projected covering fraction of the hvc population of m31 ( @xmath131exp@xmath132 for radii @xmath133 kpc ) from a vantage point outside the sphere _ and _ the observed covering fractions of @xmath134 percent for ivcs and hvcs from a vantage point inside the sphere ( see sect.2 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath94 kpc the projected covering fraction is set to unity .",
    "the characteristic radial extent of the hvc population around both galaxies is @xmath77 kpc .",
    "the mean projected covering fraction of neutral ivc / hvc gas in the halo region is @xmath135 .",
    "observations of hi , metal ions and molecular hydrogen suggest that the neutral hydrogen volume densities in ivcs and hvcs may span a large range over at least three orders of magnitude ( @xmath136 cm@xmath13 ; e.g. , wakker et al.1999 , 2004 ; richter et al.2003a , 2003b , 2009 ; sembach et al.2001 ) . for our model",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath137 cm@xmath13 , which is close to the one that has been derived for high - velocity cloud complex c ( wakker et al.1999 ) .",

    "we adopt @xmath138 kms@xmath4 for hvcs and @xmath90 kms@xmath4 for ivcs , assuming that the ( vertical ) infall velocities towards the disk are comparable to the observed radial velocities of ivcs and hvcs . since the infall velocity of hvcs is determined by the balance between the gravitational force and the ram - pressure force provided by the surrounding hot coronal gas ( e.g. , benjamin & danly 1997 ; brns & mebold 2004 ) , a more precise modeling of @xmath88 would also require the modeling of the density distribution of hot halo gas , which is beyond the scope of this study",
    ". however , from grid - based hydrodynamical simulations of hvcs heitsch & putman ( 2009 ) derive infall velocities that are very similar to the velocities adopted by us .    with the above given values for @xmath139 and @xmath88",
    "the mean hi column density in ivcs and hvcs ( from the interior view ) is @xmath102(hi)@xmath140 @xmath37 , the total hi mass in the halo at @xmath106 is @xmath141 , and the total hi mass accretion rate for gas at @xmath106 is @xmath142yr@xmath4 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the observations ( see @xmath29 ) .",
    "in the previous section we have demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce the statistical properties of the hvc population of the milky way and m31 using a model that is based on very simple geometrical assumptions . in the following ,",
    "we want to generalize our hvc model for the local galaxy population to constrain the absorption cross section of hvcs in the local universe .",
    "galaxies and their circumgalactic gaseous environment can be traced by intervening absorption lines of hi and metal ions in the spectra of distant qsos and agn .",
    "the strongest intervening neutral - gas absorbers are the so - called damped lyman @xmath32 absorbers ( dlas ) , which have hi column densities log @xmath10(hi@xmath53 .",
    "these systems contain a substantial fraction of the neutral gas mass in the universe ( wolfe et al.1995 ) .",
    "although there still is no consistent picture about the host galaxies of dlas , observations suggest that a mixed population of galaxies contribute to the absorption - cross section of dlas at @xmath17 ( e.g. , turnshek et al.2001 ; chen & lanzetta 2003 ; rao et al.2003 ) . from hi 21 cm observations of the local galaxy population zwaan et al.(2005 )",

    "it is expected that neutral gas absorbers in the extended _ halos _ of galaxies ( i.e. , hvc analogs ) have hi column densities _ below _ that of dlas ( e.g. , wakker 2004 ; thilker et al.2004 ; lockman et al.2002 ; murphy et al.1995 ) . using the common absorber classification scheme , halo absorbers therefore are expected to be seen as so - called sub - dlas ( @xmath145log @xmath10(hi@xmath146 ) and lyman - limit systems ( lls ; @xmath147log @xmath10(hi@xmath148 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the lls at low redshift therefore may represent distant analogs of the hvcs seen around the milky way and m31 ( richter et al.2011 ) .",

    "moreover , @xmath153 is proportional to the space density of galaxies , @xmath155 , and the mean geometrical cross section of optically thick hi , @xmath156 , in these galaxies : @xmath157 we adopt @xmath158 , @xmath159 kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 ( spergel et al.2007 ) .",
    "we assume that the covering fraction of optically thick hi gas is @xmath162 in the ( inclined ) disk of a galaxy and @xmath163 in the surrounding halo , where hi arises in the form of hvcs .",
    "let @xmath164 be the geometrical cross section of the ( inclined ) disk and @xmath165 the cross section of the ( spherical ) halo region with radius @xmath166 .",
    "we then can introduce an _ effective hvc cross section _ for an individual galaxy , @xmath167 , so that the total area covered by optically thick hi in and around a galaxy is @xmath168 .    from hi 21 cm measurements of the local galaxy population , zwaan et al.(2005 )",
    "have derived a dla number density per unit redshift of @xmath169 , a result that is good agreement with previous estimates ( e.g. , rosenberg & schneider 2003 ; @xmath170 ) .",

    "these hi surveys are , however , not sensitive enough and do not provide sufficient spatial resolution to identify a possibly existing hvc population in the halos of these galaxies .    based on the above - given relations ,",
    "a qso sightline passing through both an hi disk and hvc gas of a galaxy would show a dla as absorption signature , while a sightline passing only through an optically thick hvc would exhibit a sub - dla or lls .",

    "finally , rosenberg & schneider ( 2003 ) find a ( weak ) correlation between the hi mass and the j - band luminosity in their sample , log@xmath222log@xmath223 , where @xmath224 is in solar luminosity units .",
    "surveys of the local galaxy population , such as the one presented by rosenberg & schneider ( 2003 ) , show that galaxies span several orders of magnitude in parameters like hi mass , optical luminosity , and hi disk size .",
    "one crucial question that concerns the cross section of neutral gas in the halos of these galaxies is , how the size of the gaseous halo of a galaxy is related to the above listed parameters .",
    "the standard approach to scale the size of a galaxy s gaseous halo with its luminosity is to adopt a holmberg - like luminosity scaling , so that the halo radius is given by @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 kpc for b - band luminosities , as derived from analyses of intervening mgii absorbers (",
    "which trace neutral _ and _ ionized gas in disks and halos ) and their relation to galaxies ( steidel 1995 ; kacprzak et al.2008 ) .",
    "it can be shown that with the above given relations between @xmath224 , @xmath213 , and @xmath164 a holmberg - like luminosity scaling as given by equation ( 4 ) corresponds to a linear scaling of the halo radius with the hi disk radius .",

    ", we assume that the exponential decline of @xmath74 observed in m31 reflects a general behavior of hvcs in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we then can express the projected covering fraction of hvcs around galaxies as a function of its hi disk length in the form @xmath235 for m31 , @xmath236 kpc ( braun et al.2009 ; see above ) .",

    "the scaling relation between the disk and halo radius in our model then comes out to @xmath238 for all halo radii considered ( i.e. , @xmath239 ) .    since log@xmath220log@xmath221 ( see above ) , equation ( 5 ) allows us to calculate the sizes of neutral gas halos of low - redshift galaxies as a function of their hi mass and luminosity .",
    "it also enables us to predict the cross section and number density of sub - dlas and lls that represent hvc analogs , their radial distribution , and estimate the neutral - gas accretion rate of galaxies in the local universe .      as input for our generalized hvc model",
    "we adopt the hi mass distribution of low - redshift dlas from zwaan et al.(2005 ) , as derived from a high - resolution 21 cm survey of the local galaxy population . using 21 cm data from the wrst zwaan et al.(2005 )",
    "have studied the hi properties of 355 nearby galaxies and their contribution to the local dla population .",
    "the expected values of @xmath240 for the different hi masses of the galaxies in their sample are shown as gray - shaded area in the right panel of fig.2 .",
    "obviously , galaxies with hi masses in the range log@xmath241 dominate the absorption cross section of dlas at @xmath152 .",
    "based on these data , we derive for each galaxy hi mass bin the radius and area of the hi disk and the hi halo using the above discussed relations .",
    "note that we here do not take into account the possibility that the neutral gas disks of galaxies significantly extend below the dla column - density limit .",
    "using our generalized hvc model we then calculate for each mass bin the radius - dependent ( projected ) hvc covering fraction ( @xmath74 ; equation 5 ) , the effective hvc cross section ( @xmath172 ) , and the expected number density of disk+halo hi absorbers ( equation 3 ) .",
    "moreover , our model calculates for each galaxy hi mass bin the mean projected hvc covering fraction ( @xmath99 ) , the total neutral gas mass in hvcs ( @xmath242 ) , and the neutral gas mass accretion rate ( @xmath243 ) . for the infall velocities we adopt the values for @xmath88 for ivcs and hvcs listed in table 2 .",

    "all results are summarized in table 3 .",
    "based on these results we derive the following relation between the hi disk mass of galaxies , log@xmath213 ( in solar units ) , and the radius of the neutral gas halo , @xmath166 ( in [ kpc ] ) : @xmath244 if we integrate the values of @xmath173 listed in table 3 over the entire mass range , we derive a total number density of disk / halo absorbers of @xmath245 .",
    "this value is @xmath246 times larger than the number density of dlas at @xmath152 ( zwaan et al.2005 ) , suggesting that the absorption - cross section of hvcs with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 exceeds that of dlas by a factor of @xmath247 , on average . as for dlas ,",
    "the total absorption cross section of optically thick hi in disks and halos is dominated by galaxies in the mass range log@xmath241 .",
    "as our model indicates , the mean ( projected ) covering fraction of hvcs in galaxy halos is small , @xmath248 , typically .      using the mass accretion rates ( @xmath243 ) listed in table 3 together with the hi mass function of the local galaxy population ( zwaan et al.2005 ) we can estimate the neutral gas accretion - rate density of hvcs ( mass accretion rate per unit volume ) at low redshift .",
    "we obtain @xmath249yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "note that this value is calculated under the assumption that all of the neutral gas in the halos of galaxies is being accreted onto their disks , independently of its origin inside or outside the host galaxies .",
    "the above estimate does not include the mass of the ionized gas component of hvcs , which may contribute substantially to the total mass of multi - phase halo clouds ( e.g. , fox et al.2010 ; winkel et al.2011 ) . also not included are partly neutral gas fragments with masses and angular sizes below the detection limit of 21 cm hvc surveys .",
    "such structures are known to exist in the milky way halo ( richter et al.2009 ) , but their ( total ) neutral gas mass most likely is small compared to the large , extended 21 cm hvcs .",
    "the role of ionized gas is further discussed below .",
    "the value of @xmath250yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath13 is remarkably close to the star - formation rate density at @xmath152 ( @xmath251yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath13 , as derived from ultraviolet and infrared observational data ( hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , cold - gas accretion by hvcs possibly plays an important ( if not dominating ) role in feeding galaxies at @xmath17 with gaseous material to power star formation .",
    "the above given value for the accretion - rate density can also be compared with recent estimates of the `` cold - mode '' gas accretion - rate densities at @xmath152 from cosmological simulations . using an sph code , kere@xmath16 et al.(2009 ) find @xmath252yr@xmath4mpc@xmath13 for cold gas that never exceeded a maximum temperature of @xmath253 k. however , using sph simulations with more realistic gas physics vandevoort et al.(2011 )",
    "derive a much lower `` cold - mode '' gas accretion - rate density for _ galaxies _ at @xmath152 of @xmath254 yr@xmath4mpc@xmath13 , while for the superordinate dm halos the cold - mode accretion - rate is estimated to be @xmath255 yr@xmath4mpc@xmath13 , thus five - times higher .",
    "therefore , only 20 percent of the cold gas that enters the dm halo in their simulation is actually being accreted as cold gas by the central galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , these studies do not provide information on the absorption cross section of all the cold gas in the dm halos and its radial distribution around the galaxies ( independently of whether it is being accreted or not ) , so that a detailed comparison between the simulation results and our hvc model is not possible at this point .",
    "it needs to be mentioned that gas that is considered as `` cold '' in the cosmological simulations does _ not _ necessarily end up as hi high - velocity gas that is detectable via 21 cm observations .",
    "it is expected that a substantial fraction of the accreted gas that never was heated up to the virial temperature of the host halo remains diffuse and `` warm '' , i.e. , at low densities ( @xmath256 cm@xmath13 ) and intermediate temperatures ( @xmath257 k ) . the neutral gas fraction in such warm gas",
    "is expected to be low , so that it remains unseen in hi 21 cm emission (  warm  mode of gas accretion ; heitsch & putman 2009 ; bland - hawthorn 2008 ) .",
    "the existence of such a warm , ionized gas component in the halos of galaxies is strongly supported by the detection of intermediate- and high - ion absorption ( e.g. , from siiii , ciii , civ , and siiv ) in the halo of the milky way ( e.g. , fox et al.2006 ; sembach et al.1995 , 1999 ) and in the circumgalactic environments of other galaxies ( e.g. , ribaudo et al.2011 ) .",
    "also the ionized envelopes of 21 cm hvc complexes represent significant gas reservoirs that need to be considered for a realistic estimate of the _ total _ ( neutral and ionized ) gas mass that is being accreted by galaxies ( e.g. , winkel et al.2011 ; fox et al.2010 ) .",
    "the contribution of the ionized gas component to the total gas infall rate is difficult to determine , however , as the infall velocity of ionized gas may be substantially lower than for neutral gas because of hydrodynamical effects that affect the ionized cloud envelopes , such as gas stripping , turbulent mixing , and heat conduction .",
    "the same processes also affect the total cloud mass and the neutral gas fraction in hvcs and thus influence the hi volume filling factor in these clouds .",
    "these aspects clearly are best resolved through high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , heitsch & putman 2009 ; vieser & hensler 2007 ) .",
    "to estimate the contribution of hi hvcs to the number density of optically thick hi ly@xmath32 absorbers at low @xmath19 , it is necessary to know the hi cddf for log @xmath10(hi@xmath154 at low redshift ( equation 2 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the cddf at @xmath152 is poorly constrained for this column density range owing to the fact that high - column density hi absorbers are rare and that the amount of the qso absorption - line data in the ultraviolet is limited .",
    "corbelli & bandiera ( 2002 ) have combined absorption - line data for intermediate redshifts from bandiera & corbelli ( 2001 ) , low - redshift absorption data from weymann et al.(1998 ) , and 21 cm hi emission - line data from ryan - weber et al.(2003 ) to construct the hi cddf in the range log @xmath10(hi@xmath258 .",
    "the cddf presented in corbelli & bandiera ( 2002 ) can be fitted by power laws in the ranges log @xmath10(hi@xmath259 and log @xmath10(hi@xmath260 , while at log @xmath10(hi@xmath111 there seems to be a plateau in @xmath261 . since this is exactly the column - density range of relevance for hvcs ,",
    "these data imply that the total absorption - cross section of hvcs increases only mildly with a decreasing hi cutoff column density . to check the validity of this interesting feature in @xmath261 more absorption - line data for the range log @xmath10(hi@xmath111 are required . to compare the frequency of sub - dlas and lls at low redshift with the hvc absorption cross section obtained from our model",
    "we have combined the absorption / emission - line data from corbelli & bandiera ( 2002 ) and zwaan et al.(2005 ) and have constructed a `` hybrid '' hi cddf at @xmath6 , in fig.3 , left panel , shown as solid line .",
    "independent constraints for @xmath261 at low redshift come from the study by lehner et al.(2007 ) , how have analyzed low - redshift ly@xmath32 absorbers based on high - resolution hst/_stis _ data .",
    "while their study is limited to the column density range log @xmath10(hi@xmath262 , it is possible to extrapolate their cddf from the three data points between log @xmath10(hi@xmath263 ( lehner et al.2007 ; their fig.14 ) to log @xmath10(hi@xmath264 with a power law @xmath265 , where @xmath266 ( fig.3 , left panel , dashed line ) .",
    "this extrapolation nicely connects to the 21 cm data from zwaan et al.(2005 ) , but lies substantially above the hi cddf based on the corbelli et al",
    ". results . for the following ,",
    "we consider both representations of the hi cddf shown in fig.3 as plausible input parameters to estimate the absorption cross section of hi in sub - dlas and lls at @xmath6 . in a recent study , ribaudo , lehner & howk ( 2011 )",
    "have compiled a large sample of lls , most of them located at high redshifts ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "interestingly , their data points for @xmath268 fit well to the hi cddf extrapolated from the lehner et al.(2007 ) data .",
    "fig.3 , right panel , shows the ( cumulative ) number density of hi absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath269 , as a function of the cutoff hi column density , @xmath10(hi ) , dervied from integrating the two representations of the hi cddf over all column densities larger than @xmath10(hi ) ( equation 2 ) .",
    "this plot now can be directly compared to the results from our hvc model .",
    "the gray - shaded area indicates the allowed @xmath270 range ( @xmath271 percent contribution of hvcs to the hi absorber population ) for the hybrid hi cddf ( corbelli & bandiera 2002 ; zwaan et al.2005 ; left panel , solid line ) , while the gray - shaded plus green - shaded area shows the allowed @xmath270 range based on the hi cddf extrapolated from the lehner et al.(2007 ) data ( left panel , dashed line ) .",
    "the red filled circle indicates the value for @xmath173 derived from our hvc model .",
    "thus , our hvc model predicts a value for @xmath270 from hi disk and halo absorbers that lies slightly above the value expected from the hybrid cddf , but lies at a @xmath134 percent level of @xmath270 predicted by the cddf extrapolated from the lehner et al.(2007 ) data .",
    "we conclude that hvcs in our model contribute with @xmath9 percent to the population of hi ly@xmath32 absorbers with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 at @xmath17 .",
    "most likely , the contribution of hvcs is clearly less than @xmath89 percent , as extended neutral and partly - ionized gas disks with log @xmath10(hi@xmath272 and galaxy outflows ( as traced by strong mgii absorption ; see next subsection ) contribute to the population of ly@xmath32 absorbers in the lls and sub - dla column density range .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the absorption cross section of hvcs and the local hi ly@xmath32 absorber population has to await a more precise determination of the hi cddf at @xmath17 from hst/_cos _ data .",
    "the mgii resonant doublet near 2800  is commonly used to study neutral and ionized gas in the outskirts of galaxies at @xmath273 ( e.g. , bergeron & boiss 1991 ; charlton & churchill 1998 ; ding et al.2005 ) .",
    "the so - called `` strong '' mgii systems represent intervening metal absorbers in qso spectra that have rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath274  in the mgii @xmath275 line .",
    "they are commonly found within @xmath276 kpc of luminous galaxies and thus most likely are related to neutral and ionized gas in the disks and halos of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the number density of strong intervening mgii systems in the local universe is expected to be @xmath277 , as estimated from extrapolating the redshift evolution of strong mgii systems in the sdss data from @xmath278 down to @xmath17 ( nestor , turnshek & rao 2005 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath279 is @xmath280 times higher than @xmath173 estimated from our hvc model , suggesting a substantially larger absorption cross section of strong mgii systems compared to hvc hi absorbers with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 .",
    "this is expected , because with an ionization potential of @xmath281 ev mgii traces both neutral _ and _ ionized gas in the disks and halos of galaxies .",
    "kacprzak et al.(2008 ) estimated a mgii covering fraction of @xmath282 for galaxies and their gaseous halos from a sample of 37 mgii selected galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "this is roughly two times the mean value for @xmath283 in our hvc model .    in the milky way halo ,",
    "the mgii absorption cross section in hvcs has not been determined yet , mostly because of the lack of appropriate high - resolution nuv data .",
    "the covering fractions of other low and intermediate ions with strong transitions in the fuv and with ionization potentials comparable to that of mgii ( e.g. , cii , siii ) are larger than the covering fraction of optically thick hi ( richter et al.2009 ) , but not large enough to explain the high value for @xmath279 in the local universe .",
    "recent studies suggest , indeed , that many strong mgii absorbers at low redshift arise in bipolar outflows and galactic winds ( e.g. , bond et al.2001 ; bouch et al.2011 ) and thus are related to halo environments with larger mgii covering fractions in galaxies that are more actively star - forming than the milky way and m31 . from our estimate for @xmath173",
    "we conclude that the contribution of infalling gas clouds ( hvcs ) to the absorption cross section of strong mgii absorbers most likely is small , but not negligible ( @xmath284 percent ) .",
    "next to the mgii doublet in the near - uv , the two caii h&k lines in the optical near 4000  represent valuable tracers for neutral gas in the inner and outer regions of galaxies .",
    "for instance , caii absorption is frequently observed in galactic hvcs ( e.g. , richter , westmeier & brns 2005 ; ben bekhti et al.2008 ) and is used as diagnostic line to derive distance brackets for ivcs and hvcs from optical data ( e.g. , wakker et al.2007 , 2008 ; thom et al.2006 , 2008 ) . based on archival high - resolution optical spectra of more than 300 qsos , obtained with the vlt / uves",
    "spectrograph richter et al.(2011 ) have investigated intervening caii absorbers at @xmath285 and their relation to disk and halo gas components .",
    "they derive a number density per unit redshift of @xmath286 for caii systems with log @xmath10(caii@xmath287 , which is roughly 55 percent of the cross section of hi hvcs with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 estimated from our model .    in the milky way halo , the covering fraction of caii for log @xmath10(caii@xmath287 is @xmath288 ( ben bekhti et al.2008 ) , thus @xmath289 percent of that of 21 cm hvcs with log @xmath10(hi@xmath112 .",
    "as discussed in richter et al.(2011 ) , caii absorbers with log @xmath10(caii@xmath287 predominantly trace neutral gas clouds with log @xmath10(hi@xmath290 .",
    "this is due to the presence of dust in the gas ( ca is strongly depleted into dust grains ) and the mostly sub - solar metallicities of the absorbers . from these numbers it follows that intervening caii absorbers arise only in specific regions in hvcs , where the hi column density is large enough to compensate for the ca dust - depletion and abundance effects .",
    "several previous studies have discussed a possible link between intervening metal - line and hi absorbers in qso spectra and the hvc phenomenon in the milky way ( e.g. , blitz et al.1999 ; charlton , churchill & rigby 2000 ; mshar et al.2007 ; narayanan et al.2008 ; richter et al.2009 ; stocke , keeney & danforth 2010 ; ribaudo et al.2011 ) . in this study",
    ", we move this idea forward by bringing together in a quantitative manner the properties of hvcs in the milky way and m31 , qso absorption - line statistics , and neutral gas - accretion rates of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the star - formation rate density in the local universe through the infall of cold gas in the form of hvcs by using a simple geometrical model .",
    "in this model we project the observed statistical properties of the hi hvcs in the local group onto the local galaxy population , assuming a holmberg - like luminosity scaling of the halo size .",
    "the main results from our modeling are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "we emphasize at this point that we have _ not _ tuned any of the input parameters to fit the hvc cross section to the hi absorber population or any other above discussed qso absorber observables .",
    "our generalized hvc model is based solely on observed properties of the hvc population in the local group and the local galaxy population without any further assumptions .",
    "note that the exact radial dependence of projected hvc covering fraction , @xmath58 ( here assumed to be an exponential , based on the m31 data ) , is unimportant for the total absorption cross section of hvcs , as only the effective area @xmath172 ( i.e. , the product of total halo area and the _ mean _ hvc covering fraction ) is relevant for @xmath291 in a sample of randomly distributed qso sightlines .",
    "however , because the shape of @xmath58 reflects the volume - filling factor and thus the mass distribution of neutral gas around galaxies , @xmath58 is closely related to the hi accretion rate of galaxies @xmath292 .",
    "thus , for a more precise estimate of the neutral - gas accretion rate of galaxies at @xmath152 it will be important to constrain the radial distribution of hvcs around other low - redshift galaxies beyond the local group using sensitive , high - resolution 21 cm observations .",
    "such observations need to be accompanied by a more precise estimate of the dynamics of neutral gas structures along their infall path through the hot coronal gas in the halos of galaxies of different masses , e.g. , from hydrodynamical simulations ( kaufmann et al.2009 ; kere@xmath16 et al.2010 ) .",
    "since most of the gaseous material that is being accreted by galaxies at @xmath152 may be diffuse , ionized gas ( `` warm accretion '' ; bland - hawthorn 2008 ) rather than cold , neutral gas in the form of 21 cm hvcs , it will be important for future studies to investigate the distribution and mass of ionized gas in galaxy halos . diffuse ionized gas structures in the extended halos of galaxies",
    "are expected to have temperatures @xmath293 k , relatively low gas densities , and low neutral gas fractions ( i.e. , they remain unseen in 21 cm hvc surveys ) .",
    "such structures can be observed best in absorption in the fuv in the lines of low and intermediate ions such as cii , ciii , siii , and siiii ( fox et al.2006 ; ribaudo et al.2011 ) . over the next few years",
    "large amounts of such spectral data hopefully will become available from the many ongoing observational campaigns with hst/_cos_. results from these observations can be easily implemented in our halo model to predict the ionized - gas accretion rate for low - redshift galaxies .",
    "in conclusion , the increasing amount of information on the distribution and physical properties of gas in the inner and outer halos of galaxies from observations , simulations , and semi - analytic models now can be used to substantially improve our understanding of gas - accretion processes of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "our study has shown one possible way of how to combine information from the local hvc population and qso absorption - line systems at @xmath152 to investigate these processes for the local galaxy population .",
    "more detailed studies of this kind ( e.g. , including constraints for ionized halo gas ) thus could be of great importance to constrain the role of gas - accretion processes for the ongoing formation and evolution of galaxies at low @xmath19 and to characterize their connection to the cosmic web .",

    "<S> we combine hi 21 cm observations of the milky way , m31 , and the local galaxy population with qso absorption - line measurements to geometrically model the three - dimensional distribution of infalling neutral gas clouds ( `` high - velocity clouds '' , hvcs ) in the extended halos of low - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the observed distribution of hvcs around the milky way and m31 can be modeled by a radial exponential decline of the mean hi volume filling factor in their halos . </S>",
    "<S> our model suggests a characteristic radial extent of hvcs of @xmath0 kpc , a total hi mass in hvcs of @xmath1@xmath2 , and a neutral - gas - accretion rate of @xmath3yr@xmath4 for m31/milky - way - type galaxies . using a holmberg - like luminosity scaling of the halo size of galaxies we estimate @xmath5 kpc for the most massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the total absorption - cross section of hvcs at @xmath6 most likely is dominated by galaxies with total hi masses between @xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our model indicates that the hi disks of galaxies and their surrounding hvc population can account for @xmath9 percent of intervening qso absorption - line systems with log @xmath10(hi@xmath11 at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the neutral - gas accretion rate density of galaxies at low redshift from infalling hvcs is @xmath12yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath13 , which is close to the measured star - formation rate density in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> hvcs thus may play an important role for the on - going formation and evolution of galaxies . </S>"
