    "in this paper i study the exotic hadron @xmath0 ( narrow hadron resonance of 1862 mev decaying into a @xmath8 ) very recently discovered by the na49 collaboration at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous discovery of a resonance with similar mass and width decaying into a @xmath9 provides evidence for a @xmath4 iso - quadruplet .",
    "this completes a missing link of the anti - decuplet @xcite which includes the recently discovered @xmath10(1540 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover pentaquark structures have been observed in the lattice both with parity + and with parity - @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 is an extremely exciting state , because it may be the first exotic hadron to be discovered , with quantum numbers that can not be interpreted as a quark and an anti - quark meson or as a three quark baryon . in what concerns the quark structure",
    "it was known for a long time that the simplest and lightest s - wave multiquarks would be repulsive and very unstable .",
    "for instance we recently computed @xcite the mass of the groundstate s - wave @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 pentaquark , and we checked that it would have a mass of 1535 mev , close to @xmath14 . however in this channel we find a purely repulsive exotic @xmath15 hard core s - wave interaction @xcite .",
    "this suggests why pentaquarks have been hard to find , and at the same time this indicates that pentaquarks should include an excitation . because excited multiquark systems are indeed difficult to study , different perspectives of the pentaquarks are welcome to fully address these new states .",
    "exotic multiquarks are expected since the early works of jaffe @xcite .",
    "soon after the @xmath1 was observed , jaffe and wilczek @xcite , and karliner and lipkin @xcite proposed that the pentaquarks are arranged in microscopic coloured diquarks or triquarks , connected by a string in a p - wave state .",
    "this is a very appealing structure , in particular the p - wave system tends to have a narrow width because the decay is only possible if the diquarks overlap .",
    "this model needs a novel cancellation of some of the mass of diquarks , to compensate the large p - wave excitations .",
    "the exotic anti - decuplet was first predicted , with the correct @xmath1 mass and similar decay width , by diakonov , petrov and polyakov @xcite .",
    "these authors interpret the exotic anti - decuplet as a rotational excitation of the chiral topological soliton @xcite .",
    "this approach suggests that chiral symmetry and p - wave excitations are crucial to understand the pentaquarks .",
    "however the skyrme chiral soliton has some difficulty to reproduce the short range repulsion in n - n interactions .    soon after the @xmath16 was discovered , we proposed another pentaquark model @xcite which estimates a mass of 1.9 gev for the s= -2 , q = -2 state .",
    "importantly , this predicted mass is quite close to the observed one . to motivate our proposal let me first review the five possible excitations of the quark model , in decreasing energy shift order .",
    "the first excitation is the radial one , with an energy shift of @xmath17mev .",
    "the second excitation is the angular one , with an energy shift of @xmath18mev .",
    "the third excitation is the spin one , with an energy shift of @xmath19mev .",
    "the fourth excitation is the flavour one , with an energy shift of @xmath20mev or @xmath21mev .",
    "the fifth excitation is the quark - antiquark pair creation one , with an energy shift of @xmath22mev .",
    "the light mass @xmath23mev of the @xmath24 pentaquark suggests that it either has a flavour excitation or a @xmath25 pair creation , and not a p - wave excitation . because the production processes show no evidence for a weaker flavour changing reaction , we explored @xcite the @xmath25 creation hypothesis . moreover , when a flavor singlet quark - antiquark pair @xmath26 is created in the pentaquark @xmath27 , the resulting crypto - heptaquark @xmath28 is a state with an opposite parity to the original @xmath27 , where the reversed parity occurs due to the intrinsic parity of fermions and anti - fermions . in this sense",
    "the new heptaquark @xmath28 can be regarded as the chiral partner of @xmath27 . and , because @xmath28 is expected to have the lowest possible mass , it is naturally rearranged in a baryon belonging to the s - wave baryon octet and in two pseudoscalar mesons belonging to the s - wave meson octet . in this approach",
    "the mass of the heptaquark @xmath28 is simply expected to be slightly lower than the exact sum of these standard hadron masses due to the negative binding energy .",
    "for instance we recently suggested @xcite that the @xmath1 is probably a @xmath29 molecule with binding energy of 30 mev , a borromean three body s - wave boundstate of a @xmath30 , a @xmath31 and a @xmath32 @xcite , with positive parity @xcite and total isospin @xmath11 .",
    "we also addressed the s= -2 , q = -2 state @xmath0 , suggesting that it is a @xmath33 molecule .",
    "the na49 result for the iso - quadruplet of 1.862 gev is consistent with a binding energy of 60 mev for the hadronic molecule .    in this paper",
    "i extend the quantitative techniques used in our first publication for the @xmath1 , @xcite to the remaining of the anti - decuplet .",
    "i start by reviewing , in section [ framework ] , the standard quark model ( qm ) , and the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite which is adequate to study states where several quarks overlap . using the rgm ,",
    "i show that the corresponding exotic baryon - meson short range s - wave interaction is repulsive in exotic channels and attractive in the channels with quark - antiquark annihilation . in most iso - multiplets , except in the @xmath34 iso",
    "- multiplet the short range repulsion contradicts a possible pentaquark with a narrow width .",
    "section [ binding ] proceeds with the study of the heptaquarks in the exotic anti - decuplet , which are bound by the attractive non - exotic @xmath35 and @xmath36 interactions .",
    "i compute the masses of the exotic anti - decuplet . in section [ coupling ]",
    "the coupling and decays to p - wave channels are addressed .",
    "finally the conclusion is presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our hamiltonian is the standard qm hamiltonian , @xmath37 where each quark or antiquark has a kinetic energy @xmath38 with a constituent quark mass .",
    "the colour dependent two - body interaction @xmath39 includes the standard qm confining term and a hyperfine term . the quark - antiquark annihilation - creation potential @xmath40 is necessary when the potential complies with chiral symmetry , including the light pion mass and the adler zero @xcite .",
    "the rgm provides an accurate framework @xcite to compute the effective multiquark energy using the matrix elements of the quark - quark interactions .",
    "any multiquark state can be decomposed in antisimmetrised combinations of simpler colour singlets , the baryons and mesons . for the purpose of this paper the details of the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) are unimportant , only their matrix elements , extracted from the baryon spectroscopy , matter @xmath41    the detailed calculations are similar to the ones in reference @xcite , and lead to the attraction / repulsion criterion , + - _ whenever the two interacting hadrons have quarks ( or antiquarks ) with a common flavour , the repulsion is increased by the pauli principle , + - when the two interacting hadrons have a quark and an antiquark with the same flavour , the attraction is enhanced by the quark - antiquark annihilation_. + in the particular case of one nucleon interacting with anti - kaons and with kaons , this implies that the short range @xmath42 and @xmath43 interactions are repulsive , while the short range @xmath44 and @xmath45 interactions are attractive .",
    "quantitatively @xcite , the effective potentials computed for the channels relevant to this paper , are @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the isospin matrices , normalised with @xmath48 . in the chiral limit",
    "one would expect that the @xmath49 cancels with the @xmath50 , and this is confirmed by eq .",
    "( [ overlap kernel ] ) .",
    "to arrive at eq.[overlap kernel ] we used a harmonic oscillator basis @xmath51 for the multiquark wave - function , where the inverse hadronic radius @xmath52 is the only free parameter in this framework .",
    "the simplest pentaquarks are not expected to bind due to the attraction / repulsion criterion .",
    "for instance the @xmath0 can not be a @xmath53 pentaquark .",
    "the possible elementary color singlets @xmath54 or @xmath55 are repelled because the elementary color singlets share the same flavour @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "this also implies that the @xmath58 and @xmath59 systems are unbound .",
    "then the only way to have attraction consists in adding at least one quark - antiquark pair to the system .    however including an extra pion in the fundamental configurations",
    "is not possible , except in the @xmath1 .",
    "because the pion is very light it is not expected to bind into a narrow resonance @xcite , except in the @xmath1 where it may be attracted both by a @xmath32 and a @xmath31 in a borromean structure .",
    "moreover the @xmath32 and @xmath31 are repelled in this framework , and the narrow @xmath1 is not supposed to exist unless it includes a pion to bind it .    nevertheless , in the other iso - multiplets , where a @xmath60 exits , binding is possible because the @xmath60 is attracted both by the @xmath32 and the @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , although the @xmath61 system is repulsive , the @xmath62 , @xmath35 and @xmath63 systems are expected to bind .",
    "it is then convenient to build the anti - decuplet like a combinatoric newton pyramid , starting by the summit , @xmath64 , i=0 , @xmath1 . to reach any of the other three iso - multiplets in the anti - decuplet ,",
    "one simply needs to add respectively one , two or three @xmath6 , @xmath60 , ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) to the @xmath1 .",
    "altough we advocate @xcite that @xmath1 is a @xmath29 linear molecule , let us consider for the flavour purpose , that it has the flavour of a i=0 , @xmath42 system .",
    "the next @xmath6 , @xmath67 iso - multiplet ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) can be obtained combining a @xmath6 , @xmath60 , ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) with the @xmath1 .",
    "a possible binding structure is a @xmath62 linear molecule .",
    "the next @xmath7 , @xmath70 iso - multiplet ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) can be obtained combining a @xmath6 , @xmath60 , ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) with the @xmath67 .",
    "the simplest exotic binding structure is pentaquark with the flavour of a @xmath35 system .",
    "finally the last @xmath4 , @xmath74 iso - multiplet ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath53 ) can be obtained combining a @xmath6 , @xmath60 , ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) with the @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the simplest exotic binding structure is a @xmath63 linear molecule .",
    "the different multiquarks are summarised in table [ heptaquark candidates ] .",
    "i now compute the energy of the simplest state , the i=1 iso - triplet @xmath70 , as a pentaquark with the quantum numbers of a @xmath35 system .",
    "the other @xmath45 system , the iso - singlet @xmath11 @xmath78 has been studied in detail in the literature .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath7 system is also attractive , moreover the @xmath35 binding is relevant to the @xmath4 , @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the reduced mass is @xmath79 mev , and the potential @xmath80 is attractive and separable , where @xmath81 was computed in eq .",
    "( [ overlap kernel ] ) and where @xmath52 is a free parameter . in the @xmath82 case ,",
    "binding exists if @xmath83 304 mev .",
    "however for a binding energy of the order of 60 mev , close to the one proposed for the the exotic @xmath0 and consitent with a crypto - exotic @xmath70(1385 ) a too small @xmath84 would be required . therefore binding",
    "is expected in this system , although an accurate prediction of the binding energy of this @xmath70 system would need technical improvements of our method , see section [ conclusion ] for details .      . proposed list of multiquark states , candidates to the exotic pentaquark and heptaquark anti - decuplets . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     i now use an adiabatic hartree method to study the stability of the linear @xmath85 molecule . while the @xmath7 pentaquark is not a molecule since the five quarks and antiquarks overlap in a s - wave state , here the large @xmath43 repulsion , with @xmath86 mev , prevents the overlap of all the quarks .",
    "essentially the wave - function of the @xmath31 is centred between the two @xmath60 , and the two @xmath60 only overlap with the nucleon , but not with each other .",
    "this results in a linear molecule .",
    "i solve a schrdinger equation for a @xmath60 in the potential produced by a nucleon placed at the origin and by the other @xmath60 placed at a distance @xmath87 of the nucleon .",
    "the potential of the @xmath31 is produced by a @xmath60 anti - kaon at the point @xmath87 and another anti - kaon at the point @xmath88 .",
    "the potentials are respectively , @xmath89 where the sub - index denotes the position of the potential .",
    "this produces three binding energies @xmath90 , and three wave - functions . in the hartree method",
    "the total energy is the sum of these energies minus the matrix elements of the potential energies , @xmath91 this is easily computed once the two schrdinger equations are respectively solved with the potentials ( [ potential k ] ) and ( [ potential n ] ) .",
    "the total energy is a function of the distance @xmath92 , and i minimise it as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "the energy minimum is obtained for @xmath94 .",
    "the centres of the two @xmath60 are separated by a distance of @xmath95 , and therefore they essentially do not overlap .",
    "i first verify that binding is easy to produce in this system , although an @xmath52 consistent with the expected nucleon radius @xmath96 fm would produce a small binding energy .",
    "then the case of the excessively small @xmath84 , that provides a large binding for the @xmath35 system , is investigated .",
    "this would already correspond to an extremely large nucleon mean radius @xmath97 , nevertheless let us check that a larger binding can be obtained for the @xmath98 . in this case i find that all the three one hadron binding energies are similar to -40 mev . when the potential energies are subtracted in eq .",
    "( [ hartree energy ] ) , the final binding energy results in @xmath99 -40mev which is consistent with a @xmath0 mass of @xmath100 gev .",
    "this remains larger than a mass of @xmath101 gev for the @xmath0 , however a complete computation of the effect of coupled channels on the binding energy remain to be estimated .",
    "the length @xmath102 of the @xmath98 linear molecule is larger than @xmath103 fm , even when we have a small nucleon , with @xmath104 mev .",
    "a similar binding energy , and a similar mass of the order of @xmath105 gev can be computed for the @xmath106 system in the non - exotic iso - doublet .",
    "in the case of the @xmath107 , the mass is already 400 mev higher than the mass of the @xmath108 system , and 200 mev higher than the mass of the @xmath109 system . in this case",
    "the p - wave excitation may also be relevant , as suggested by the chiral soliton model and by the diquark model .",
    "moreover the decay channels are also p - wave channels .",
    "this motivates the study of the coupling of the s - wave crypto - heptaquark system to the p - wave pentaquark systems .    the simplest model to couple a s - wave crypto - heptaquark to a p - wave pentaquark consists in assuming the standard @xmath110 quark - antiquark creation / annihilation potential . the coupling form factor is computed with the overlap of the s - wave crypto - heptaquark @xmath111 with the p - wave pentaquarks @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) plus a flavour singlet @xmath110 quark - antiquark pair . between these two wave - functions we must sandwich the quark antisimmetriser .",
    "after separating the center of mass coordinates , the coupling is equivalent to an overlap of harmonic oscillator wave - functions of the six jacobi coordinates depicted in fig .",
    "[ jacobi coordinates ] .",
    "the ribeiro graphical @xcite rules , and the harmonic oscillator energy conservation , require that at least one of the heptaquark coordinates should include a radial excitation .",
    "the @xmath61 relative coordinate is expected to be partly excited because the @xmath61 are repelled .",
    "if we compare our coupling with the decay of the rho into two pions we find a suppression in the coupling by a factor of 1/3 .",
    "the decay width is proportional to the square of the coupling and this factor already explains the small decay width of heptaquarks which are found in all experiments to be smaller than 20 mev .",
    "moreover the ribeiro rules show that overlaps with excited wave - functions are further suppressed",
    ". however , for a consistent computation , the probability for a @xmath110 annihilation to occur in a pentaquark remains to be consistenly studied .",
    "nevertheless the p - wave pentaquark components should essentially not affect the mass of the crypto - heptaquark .",
    "the relative comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 decay widths can be estimated with a better precision than the full computation of the decay .",
    "the decay widths depend on the phase space , and they are proportional to @xmath114 in the non - relativistic case and to @xmath115 in the ultra - relativistic case , when the momentum is smaller that the inverse radius @xmath52 .",
    "therefore i expect that the partial decay width of the @xmath0 to a p - wave @xmath116 is larger than the @xmath1 decay to a p - wave @xmath117 by a factor of @xmath118 , and i expect that the partial decay width of the @xmath0 to a p - wave @xmath119 is larger than the @xmath1 decay to a p - wave @xmath117 by a factor smaller than @xmath120 . thus it is expected that the total decay width of the @xmath0 is larger by a factor @xmath121 than the decay width of the @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , because the decay width of the @xmath1 is quite small , the coupling of the crypto - heptaquark to the p - wave pentaquark is not expected to be large .",
    "to conclude , in this paper i address the exotic anti - decuplets with a standard quark model hamiltonian , where the quark - antiquark annihilation is constrained by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "i first derive a criterion showing that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 hadrons very recently discovered can not be an s - wave or p - wave pentaquark .",
    "it is plausible that the @xmath0 is a linear @xmath122 molecule , a heptaquark state .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath1 and the @xmath6 , @xmath67 are also heptaquarks , or linear meson - meson - baryon molecules . in these linear molecules the two external hadrons do not overlap .",
    "all these heptaquarks have a positive parity .",
    "the only pentaquark is the iso - triplet @xmath70 , with the quantum numbers of a tightly bound s - wave @xmath82 system , a negative parity system .",
    "the spectrum of the pentaquark and heptaquark antidecuplets is depicted in figure [ triangle ] , assuming that the experimental @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 gev are correct .",
    "importantly , the @xmath0(1862 ) is expected to decay both to the @xmath116 and to the @xmath125 p - wave channels .    for a future improvement of this work",
    "it is important to discuss the size parameter @xmath97 . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we used a quite large @xmath126 fm@xmath127 , for the potential involving the pion .",
    "the pion is expected to couple with a shorter range interaction than other hadrons , because the adler zero suppresses the low momentum part of the pionic couplings .",
    "nevertheless the very short range pion potential and the longer range kaon potential suggest that the hadron - hadron interactions should have at least two different interactions . for instance",
    "the n - n interaction is decomposed in a short range interaction due to quark pauli repulsion , a medium range @xmath128 or two pion exchange potential , and a long range one pion exchange potential .",
    "the use of similar interactions may further increase the binding of multiquark molecules .",
    "other technical improvements that deserve to be investigated , although they are not straightforward to implement at the microscopic level of quarks , are the coupling to p - wave channels and the exact three body equations .",
    "i expect that the advocated heptaquarks will help to motivate the detailed experimental studies of the @xmath129 , @xmath67 , @xmath70 and @xmath130 @xcite",
    ". this will be crucial to discriminate the different theoretical models candidate to explain the anti - decuplet , @xcite .",
    "i thank gonalo marques for discussions on the algebraic computations of this paper . as a note added in proof ,",
    "i would like to acknowledge takashi nakano and eulogio oset for mentioning that a @xmath70 similar to the one advocated here has already been predicted @xcite , and that cristoph hanhart pointed that a @xmath131 heptaquark may correspond to the roper resonance @xmath67(1440 ) @xcite .",

    "<S> i study the very recently discovered s=-2 resonance @xmath0 ( 1886 ) by the na49 collaboration at the cern sps . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance was already predicted , with a mass close to 1.9 gev , in a recent publication mostly dedicated to the s=1 resonance @xmath1(1540 ) . to confirm this recent prediction , </S>",
    "<S> i apply the same standard quark model with a quark - antiquark annihilation constrained by chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this method also explained with success the repulsive hard core of nucleon - nucleon , kaon - nucleon exotic scattering , and the short range attraction present in pion - nucleon and pion - pion non - exotic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> i find that repulsion excludes the @xmath0 as a @xmath2 s - wave pentaquark . </S>",
    "<S> i explore the @xmath0 as a heptaquark , equivalent to a @xmath3 linear molecule , with positive parity and total isospin @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> i find that the kaon - kaon repulsion is cancelled by the attraction existing in the kaon - nucleon channels . in our framework </S>",
    "<S> this state is easier to bind than the @xmath1 described by a @xmath5 borromean bound - state . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath6 doublet and @xmath7 triplet of the exotic anti - decuplet are also studied , and the coupling to p - wave decay channels is briefly addressed . </S>"
