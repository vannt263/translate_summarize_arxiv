    "in studies of exoplanet systems , certain assumptions are made about the inclination ( @xmath0 ) of the systems discovered ; i.e. , it is assumed the orbit has an intermediate to high inclination ( @xmath1 ) because the probability of the orbit being nearly face - on ( @xmath2 ) is extremely low .",
    "if we assume a random sample of orbital orientations along our line of sight , the probability of the inclination being less or equal to a given @xmath0 is [ @xmath3 while the probability of an inclination being greater than a given @xmath0 is @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the probability of an orbit with an inclination below 45@xmath5 is @xmath630% while the probability of the orbit having an inclination above 45@xmath5 is @xmath670% .",
    "this conclusion implies that the calculated companion mass , known only as the quantity @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the planet , is planetary in nature instead of stellar .",
    "while this is probably a safe conclusion for the majority of the exoplanets discovered , the chance remains that in a large enough sample , a few of the candidate planetary systems may be face - on binary star systems instead .",
    "we make no assumptions about the inclination .",
    "if a second star is present and is not more than @xmath62.5 magnitudes fainter than the host star , the effects of the second star will be seen in the interferometric visibility curve of 2.5 is a lower limit , as the true @xmath9 also depends on the absolute brightness of the two stars and could be higher for other systems . ] .",
    "see figure  [ singlevsbinary_viscurve ] for an example of the difference between the visibility curves for a single star and binary system .",
    "two studies have shown that radial velocity observations of exoplanet systems alone are insufficient to distinguish between intermediate- to high - inclination planetary systems and low - inclination binary star systems .",
    "estimated probability densities of orbital periods and eccentricities for a sample of exoplanet candidates and a sample of spectroscopic binary star systems with solar - type primary stars in order to determine if there were any fundamental differences between the two types of systems .",
    "they found the respective distributions of the two populations were statistically indistinguishable from each other in the context of orbital elements .    in an earlier study , modeled nine known exoplanet systems as binary star systems to test if the radial velocity observations could be explained by low - mass stellar companions .",
    "although the probability of binary star systems appearing as planetary systems was low , ranging from 0.01 to 4% , the model results described the observations satisfactorily and showed it is possible for a binary star system to mimic an exoplanet system .",
    "@xcite argue that @xmath10% of the exoplanet systems with jupiter - mass planets with semimajor axes of @xmath110.1 au may have formed in binary systems where the binary star companion is highly inclined to the planet s orbit .",
    "furthermore , it has been proposed that planets form in the same manner in both single - star and binary - star systems during certain stages @xcite",
    ". this would be significant due to the fact that more than half of all stars form in binary or multiple star systems .",
    "our target list was derived from the general exoplanet list using declination limits and magnitude constraints .",
    "the stars needed to be north of -10@xmath5 , brighter than @xmath12 in order for the tip / tilt subsystem to lock onto the star , and brighter than @xmath13 so fringes were easily visible .",
    "this reduced the original list to @xmath680 targets , and we observed 22 systems from 2004 january to 2007 september .",
    "the stars were observed using the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array , a six - element y - shaped interferometric array located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "the array presently uses visible wavelengths at 470 - 800 nm for tracking and tip / tilt corrections and near infrared bands , @xmath14 at 1.67  @xmath15 m and @xmath16 at 2.15  @xmath15 m , for fringe detection and data collection .",
    "all observations of the host stars were obtained using the pupil - plane `` chara classic '' beam combiner in the @xmath16-band .",
    "the observations were taken using many of the baselines the chara array offers from intermediate - length baselines at 108 m to the longest baseline available at 331 m. table [ observations ] lists the exoplanet host stars observed , their calibrators , the baselines used , the dates of the observations , and the number of observations obtained .",
    "calibrators were chosen to have small predicted angular diameters in order to reduce errors in the target s angular diameter measurement , and the calibrators were as close to the target stars as possible , usually within 5@xmath5 .",
    "this allowed for less time between calibrator and target observations , thus reducing the effects of changing seeing conditions as much as possible .",
    "we observed using the standard calibrator - target - calibrator pattern , which allowed us to see if the target star was changing with respect to the calibrator over time , assuming the calibrator did not have an unseen stellar companion or a circumstellar disk . in order to select reliable calibrators",
    ", we searched the literature for indications of binarity and performed spectral energy distribution fits to published @xmath17 photometry to see if there was any excess flux that would indicate a stellar companion .",
    "calibrator candidates with variable radial velocities were discarded even if their seds displayed no characteristics of duplicity .",
    "stellar companions in low - inclination orbits could show themselves in two ways : in the residuals to the diameter fit to calibrated visibilities ( sensitive to companions at separations of @xmath60.5 to 10 milliarcseconds ) and as separated fringe packets ( for companions in the separation range of @xmath610 to 50 milliarcseconds ) .",
    "the two methods are described in more detail below .",
    "the systematics in the residuals of the diameter fit to measured visibilities indicate whether or not a stellar companion may be present . for a single star ,",
    "the residuals show a gaussian distribution about 0 ( see figure [ exp_goodresid ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ exp_oddresid ] shows the strongly systematic behavior in the residuals for a known binary star system .",
    "inspection of figure [ exp_goodresid ] shows that the error estimates of the calibrated visibilities in all cases exceed the ( observed - calculated ) residuals ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , the error estimates in the measured instrumental visibilities are conservatively taken from the standard deviation from the mean of subgroupings of individual visibility scans . in this case , those estimates provide a reduced @xmath19 less than unity , which indicates that our individual visibility error estimates are too large .",
    "the standard deviation for the residuals for figure [ exp_goodresid ] is @xmath200.056 while @xmath18  =  @xmath200.106 for figure [ exp_oddresid ] .",
    "the typical @xmath18 for a single star is well under @xmath200.100 while @xmath18 for a binary with a low @xmath9 is usually @xmath210.100 .",
    "for example , the binary system hd  146361 , which is composed of two nearly - identical stars and has a @xmath22 0.2 , was observed by deepak raghavan for three nights in may of 2007 along with the calibrator star hd  152598 .",
    "the measured @xmath18 for the three nights observations are @xmath200.180 , @xmath200.229 , and @xmath200.118 indicating a departure from the single - star model for this system ( private communication ) .",
    "another diagnostic to distinguish between the single star seen in figure 2 and the binary star system shown in figure 3 is to compare their @xmath19 values .",
    "a low @xmath19 value indicates a good fit to the single - star model while a large value indicates a poor fit , revealing the presence of a secondary star , circumstellar disk , or an asymmetry of the star .",
    "for example , the @xmath19 for the star shown in figure 2 is 1.80 while @xmath19 = 20.89 for the binary star seen in figure 3 .    for each exoplanet system ,",
    "a variety of low - mass secondary stars were considered : g5  v , k0  v , k5  v , m0  v , and m5  v. most of the stars in the sample are solar - type stars , so more massive main sequence spectral types need not be considered .",
    "the magnitude difference ( @xmath23m@xmath24 , listed as @xmath9 in the tables ) and angular separation ( @xmath25 ) of a face - on orbit between the host star and companion were calculated for each possible pairing :    @xmath26    where m@xmath27 are the absolute magnitudes of the host star and potential secondary , respectively , m@xmath28 is the apparent magnitude of the host star , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the host star s parallax in milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "an estimate of the angular separation @xmath25 in mas was calculated from kepler s third law and @xmath30 : @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\times \\pi , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 are the masses ( in @xmath33 ) of the exoplanet s host star and potential secondary star , respectively , and @xmath34 is the companion s orbital period in years .    additionally , the angular diameter @xmath35 of the possible secondary was estimated using the calibration of radius as a function of spectral type from @xcite and the parallax of the host star .",
    "the masses for the exoplanet host stars and masses and radii for the possible secondary companions were obtained from @xcite , which in turn were based on values derived from , who used observations of binary stars in order to create empirical relationships between various stellar parameters as a function of luminosity class .",
    "tables [ host_obs_props ] , [ poss_sec_params ] , and [ secondary_diams ] present the results of these calculations . for each exoplanet host star studied , the observed values required for the calculations described above are listed in table [ host_obs_props ] , while table [ poss_sec_params ] shows the calculated @xmath9 and @xmath25 for each type of possible secondary star .",
    "table [ secondary_diams ] includes the calculated angular diameters of the potential secondary companions for each system .",
    "it should be noted that if the companion star is a pre - main - sequence star , the resulting @xmath9 becomes smaller due to the star s increased brightness prior to hydrogen fusion and therefore has a higher probability of being detected .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath35 , @xmath9 , and @xmath25 were then used to plot the visibility curves for both a single star with the host star s measured angular diameter and for a binary system with the calculated parameters .",
    "the projected position angle of a binary star vector separation onto the interferometric baseline is , of course , unknown and is here assumed to be 0@xmath5 to explore the effects of the maximum separation exhibited by the secondary .",
    "as this angle approaches 90@xmath36 , the modulation to the visibility curve diminishes because the binary becomes unresolved at 90@xmath36 .    to estimate the detection sensitivity ,",
    "the largest difference between the visibility curves for a single star and for a binary system with the parameters listed in table [ poss_sec_params ] was calculated .",
    "this quantity , @xmath37 , then represented the maximum deviation of the binary visibility curve from the single - star curve .",
    "the lower limit to rule out stellar companions was selected to be 2@xmath18 , where @xmath18 is the standard deviation of the residuals to the diameter fit ; i.e. , if @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 for a given secondary component , that particular spectral type can be eliminated as a possible stellar companion . if @xmath37 @xmath40 @xmath39 , the effects of the companion would not be clearly seen in the visibility curve , and that spectral type can not be ruled out .",
    "for each exoplanet host star , table [ compare_resids ] lists the observed @xmath18 and the predicted @xmath37 for each secondary type considered , and the final column indicates the cutoff point for the non - detection of a stellar companion .",
    "for example , if `` k5  v '' is listed in the last column , the spectral types more massive than a k5  v could be eliminated from consideration but stars of type k5  v and later are still possible companions .",
    "a dash in this column indicates all companion spectral types can be ruled out .    using the data from table [ compare_resids ] , figure [ bv_comptype ]",
    "was created to demonstrate the sensitivity of the interferometric observations to stellar companions . for each exoplanet host star observed , the absolute @xmath41-band magnitude was found from _ the hipparcos and tycho catalogues _ .",
    "then the night with the lowest @xmath18 was chosen to be the best case scenario when determining which secondary stars could be eliminated from consideration .",
    "the difficulty of ruling out the more massive companion types for the intrinsically brighter stars is expected , as the @xmath9 will already be large even for brighter companions and beyond the scope of the chara array .",
    "host stars that are less massive are fainter , and the @xmath9 lies more within the sensitivity limit of the chara array .",
    "two stars showed systematics in their visibility measurements that could indicate an unseen stellar companion in some datasets .",
    "the first star is @xmath42  andromedae ( @xmath42  and , hd  9826 , f8  v ) .",
    "its first planetary candidate was announced by @xcite and two more planets were discovered two years later @xcite .",
    "an m4.5  v stellar companion was found accompanying @xmath42  and at a distance of @xmath6750  au from the central star @xcite .",
    "this star would not have affected our search for more close - in stellar companions , as the angular distance from the host star is 55@xmath43 and is well out of the field of view of the chara array .",
    "@xmath42  and was part of two intensive observing campaigns using the chara array in 2005 august and 2007 september and the data can not be fit with a simple limb - darkened disk for two of the nine nights of data .",
    "in one dataset ( 2005/08/04 ) , the target s visibilities briefly became higher than the calibrator s visibilities , and in the other dataset ( 2005/08/10 ) , the target s and calibrator s visibilities separated over time .",
    "these patterns indicate one of the stars is changing with respect to the other .",
    "two different calibrators were used for these two nights of data , and other data obtained using the same calibrators show no systematics in the visibilities .",
    "therefore , we do not claim a stellar companion to @xmath42  and at this time .",
    "the second star to show oddities in its visibility measurements was @xmath44  coronae borealis ( @xmath44  crb , hd  143761 , g0  v ) . a planetary companion to @xmath44  crb was announced by @xcite before a later study derived a face - on orbit with an m dwarf , not a planet @xcite",
    "this claim was then refuted by @xcite , who used high - dispersion infrared spectroscopy to determine if they could detect any flux from an m dwarf companion , as it would lie within the sensitivity limits of their instrument .",
    "no such flux was detected and they concluded the companion was planetary in nature .",
    "the controversy surrounding this system made it an interesting target to observe using the chara array .",
    "we observed @xmath44  crb for three nights using three different calibrators and found that the data for two of the four nights exhibited behavior inconsistent with a single star .",
    "the two nights in question are 2005/06/29 and 2005/07/03 , and because those observations were taken using the same calibrator and the data taken using other calibrators fall in line with a single star , it is likely that it was the calibrator and not @xmath44  crb that was varying .",
    "there are currently plans to image both @xmath42  and and @xmath44  crb using the michigan infrared combiner @xcite on the chara array , which may help to clarify the situation for both stars .",
    "the second method to check for unseen low - mass stellar companions is by searching for separated fringe packets ( sfps ) .",
    "when a star has a wide companion ( @xmath610 to 100 mas ) , two fringe packets - one from each star - may be observed if the baseline orientation is favorable ; i.e. , if the projected baseline angle is approximately parallel to the position angle of the binary and both fringe packets are within the data collection scan window . however ,",
    "if the two stars have a small angular separation or the position angle is perpendicular to the projected baseline angle , the two fringe packets will overlay each other and appear as one fringe packet .",
    "for example , if a binary system with a @xmath9=0 has a separation of more than @xmath610  mas and is in the optimal orientation as described above , sfps may be visible , as can be seen in figure [ exp_sfp_deltam0 ] .",
    "if the same system has a @xmath222.5 or is not in the optimal orientation , no secondary fringe would be observed , as is shown in figure [ exp_sfp_deltam2 ] .",
    "the baseline used in the observations also plays a role in whether or not sfps will be detected , as the separation of the fringes depends on the baseline length .",
    "therefore , a system appearing as an sfp on the long baseline of s1-e1 will not be an sfp on the shortest baseline , s1-s2 .",
    "the detection of sfps also depends partly on whether both fringe packets lie within the scan window .",
    "the width of the scan window depends on the baseline , wavelength used , and the frequency of the observations . for an average observation in the @xmath45-band using a 100-m baseline ,",
    "the scan window will cover @xmath6300 mas while at a 300-m baseline , the scan window width is @xmath6100 mas . if the sfp is wider than the scan window width , data on the second fringe can not be collected .    for completeness",
    ", all the stars observed in this project were checked for sfps , whether or not the calculated separation of the secondary star would indicate the possibility of separated fringes .",
    "each of the @xmath6200 scans in every dataset consists of a sampling of the zero - path - length delay space where fringes are located . for each individual scan ,",
    "the strongest fringe was located and an envelope was fit to the fringe .",
    "the fringe envelope was obtained using a hilbert tranform , achieved by taking the fourier transform of the fringe scan , setting the negative frequencies to zero , and taking the modulus of the inverse fourier transform @xcite .",
    "then the peak of the primary fringe envelope for each of the data scans was located and shifted so that the fringe envelopes for all the scans overlaid each other and the fringe amplitudes were added together . this `` shift and",
    "approach made it possible to view multiple fringe envelopes at once to see if there was any indication of a sfp .",
    "the result was a plot of the weighted mean fringe envelope .",
    "figures  [ exp_frgenv ] and [ exp_frgenv_sfp ] shows an examples of the fringe envelopes for a single star and binary system , respectively .",
    "if there were three or fewer bracketed observations in the dataset , only one observation from each of the calibrator and object stars was inspected for sfps .",
    "otherwise the first and last observations in a night s dataset were inspected from sfps for both the object and the calibrator in order to maximize changes in the stars position angles with respect to the baseline over time .",
    "no sfp binaries were discovered for the exoplanet host stars or their calibrators .",
    "in an effort to cull out any possible binary star systems in the exoplanet sample , we inspected the exoplanet host stars using the chara array using two methods .",
    "the first involved characterizing the residuals of the diameter fit to calibrated visibilities .",
    "if the observed residuals were more than twice the predicted variations for a given binary system , the secondary spectral type in question could be ruled out .",
    "no stellar companions were detected but certain secondary spectral types were eliminated for each exoplanet host star .",
    "we also inspected the data for secondary fringe packets , which could be present if a secondary star had the proper orientation to the baseline used for the observations .",
    "no secondary fringe packet binaries were found , further reducing the possibility that these exoplanet systems are binary star systems instead .",
    "many thanks to p.j .",

    "the chara array is funded by the national science foundation through nsf grants ast-0307562 and ast-0606958 and by georgia state university through the college of arts and sciences .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad literature database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system .",

    "<S> interferometric observations will show evidence of a stellar companion if it sufficiently bright , regardless of the inclination . using the chara array , we observed 22 exoplanet host stars to search for stellar companions in low - inclination orbits that may be masquerading as planetary systems . while no definitive stellar companions were discovered , it was possible to rule out certain secondary spectral types for each exoplanet system observed by studying the errors in the diameter fit to calibrated visibilities and by searching for separated fringe packets . </S>"
