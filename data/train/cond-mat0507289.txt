    "it turns out that the phases at the endpoints , @xmath5 ( denoted , following ref .",

    "the first order nature of the transition observed in gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 is at variance with mean - field theory which predicts@xcite a second - order transition . in order to clarify the order of the transition , and to see whether it is affected by longer range exchange interactions which lift the degeneracy of @xmath3",
    ", we have performed monte carlo simulations of the classical dipolar heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice .",

    "this frequently occurs when the number of components of the order parameter @xmath10 is larger than 4,@xcite . in general ,",
    "such transitions are expected to be only _ weakly _ first - order .",
    "another microscopic scenario for a first order transition is the proposal of brazovskii@xcite that the existence of a continuous set of degenerate soft modes could change the order of the transition .",
    "it was latter shown that the rg analysis of models with soft modes along special directions lacks stable fixed points and the models are indeed likely to undergo first - order transitions.@xcite this scenario is , for instance , relevant to the description of the liquid crystal transition where the degeneracy naturally comes from the isotropy of the liquid.@xcite it is also particularly relevant in frustrated magnets where frustration may , precisely , provide a large number of quasi - degenerate soft - modes , though with different geometrical structures .",
    "we shall consider a similar rg analysis , applicable for the symmetry of the dipolar pyrochlores which have lines of degeneracy , in this paper .",
    "in this work , we study the order of the transition of the classical heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice with long - range dipole - dipole interactions and exchange interactions .",
    "we show , by means of monte - carlo simulations , that the transition is _ strongly _ first - order when a continuous set of soft modes is present in @xmath11 , and becomes _ weakly _ first - order when that degeneracy is removed by including further neighbor interactions ( sec .",

    "we present in this section some results of monte carlo simulations , using the parallel tempering approach,@xcite on the heisenberg model with dipolar and exchange interactions on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the classical heisenberg hamiltonian is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a classical spin vector of length @xmath2 ( for gd@xmath14 ) on site @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the heisenberg exchange between the neighbors : we will consider the first ( @xmath17 ) , second ( @xmath18 ) and third neighbor ( @xmath19 ) couplings.@xcite    the number of spins is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the factor of 16 arises because the pyrochlore lattice consists of an fcc lattice of tetrahedra , each tetrahedron has 4 spins , and there are 4 sites of the fcc lattice in the conventional cubic cell . to incorporate the b - phase with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "we need @xmath22 to be even , so most of our results are for @xmath23 and 4 . often the long - range dipolar interactions are cut - off beyond a couple of neighbors@xcite to speed up the simulations .",
    "however , here we have kept a large number of neighbors ( practically infinite ) in order to reproduce accurately the structure of the degenerate states . if the dipole - dipole interaction is cut - off , ripples appear in the degenerate lines of soft modes@xcite .",
    "we constructed periodic repetitions of the monte carlo clusters and included the contributions of many blocks in performing the dipolar sums .",
    "because there is no cut - off in the dipole interactions , the simulation becomes slow for large sizes , so we are limited to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .    we investigate ordering at @xmath26 ( called a ) see fig .",
    "[ astate ] , and at @xmath27 ( called b ) , see ref .",
    "[ ] . with a ordering the order parameter has @xmath28 components and with b ordering it has @xmath29 components as detailed in sec .",
    "the @xmath10-component order parameters are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the unit vector of spin @xmath15 assuming the system is fully ordered in component @xmath32 of ordering type a with the @xmath33 state ( resp .",

    "we therefore compute the invariant quantities @xmath39 it is convenient to also compute the dimensionless binder ratio @xmath40 , \\ ] ] for both a and b orderings , which has the property that it tends to 0 at high temperature and to 1 in an ordered state .",

    "firstly we consider the dipolar model with only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "results for the order parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ montecarlosimulation1 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is taken to be the same as in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , i.e. from the high temperature susceptibility @xmath41k , and the dipole - dipole interactions are fixed by the inter - ion distances.@xcite the order parameter associated with the a state jumps rapidly at @xmath42 k , indicating a strong first order transition at that temperature , whereas that of the b state goes to zero at the same temperature .",
    "these results gives a much lower value of the transition temperature @xmath43 than the mean - field theory value of @xmath44 k , though it is a bit smaller than the experimental value of 1 k.    the binder ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ montecarlosimulation2 ] is also strongly discontinuous . in the vicinity of @xmath45",
    "the binder ratio gets negative , as expected for a first - order phase transition.@xcite given the results of figs .",
    "[ montecarlosimulation1 ] and [ montecarlosimulation2 ] , we conclude that the transition is _ strongly _ first - order for @xmath46 .",
    "the very small preference for the b - phase@xcite indicated by the small minimum of @xmath3 at @xmath47 , which would be relevant at a second order transition , is unimportant here because the transition is so strongly first order .",
    "we now include further neighbor interactions @xmath18 and @xmath19 that lift the degeneracy of the dipolar model and select other states , as studied in detail in ref .",
    "the lowest part of the spectrum of @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ degeneracyj2j3 ] for @xmath4 along the @xmath48 direction .",
    "we see that spectrum is almost precisely degenerate for @xmath49 but that @xmath50 is preferred if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are negative , while @xmath9 is preferred if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath51 and study how the character of the transition is modified relative to the case @xmath49 .    for @xmath52",
    ", we find the same a state as for @xmath53 , but the transition temperature shifts to higher temperatures , see figs .",

[ montecarlosimulationj1j22 ] , vary in a much more gradual way than for the degenerate case @xmath53 .",
    "although only finite - size scaling on a bigger range of sizes could say whether the transition is first or second order , it is clear that removing the degeneracy makes the transition less first - order compared with the degenerate case .",
    "these results are consistent with earlier simulations on model without dipole - dipole interactions ( where larger clusters could be considered ) which pointed out a continuous@xcite or _ weakly _ first - order@xcite transition for the pyrochlore lattice with @xmath55 .",
    "next we consider @xmath56 which , from fig .",
    "[ degeneracyj2j3 ] , is expected to favor the b - like states ( @xmath27 ) , and indeed this is the case as shown by figs .",
    "[ montecarlosimulation3 ] and [ montecarlosimulation4 ] . the minimum of @xmath3 at @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "[ degeneracyj2j3 ] is independent of @xmath18 and @xmath19 which implies that the mean - field transition temperature is also independent of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "although we do not have enough system sizes to attempt a serious estimate of @xmath43 using finite size scaling , it seems that the transition temperature is indeed quite similar to that for @xmath57 .    as was also found for @xmath52 ,",
    "the transition is much more gradual than for the degenerate case , showing that removing the degeneracy reduces the first - order character of the transition .",
    "the sensitive dependence of both the order of the transition and the nature of the ordered phase on @xmath18 and @xmath19 points to the possible relevance of these terms in explaining the difference between gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 and gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "while the data for @xmath53 clearly indicate a strong first order transition , our results for @xmath18 and @xmath19 non - zero ( with either sign ) are not conclusive as to the order of the transition . the smooth behavior of the binder ratios shown in figs .",
    "[ montecarlosimulationj1j22 ] and [ montecarlosimulation4 ] is typical for a second order transition .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of a _ weak _ first order transition where the correlation length at the critical point , @xmath58 , is large . in this case ,",
    "if @xmath59 the behavior will look like that of a second order transition . only for sizes",
    "where @xmath60 can one see a crossover to behavior expected at a first order transition .",
    "hence for @xmath18 and @xmath19 non - zero , where the degeneracy is removed , the transition is either second order or weakly first order .",
    "however , comparing figs .",
    "[ montecarlosimulationj1j22 ] and [ montecarlosimulation4 ] with the corresponding figure for @xmath53 , fig .",
    "[ montecarlosimulation2 ] , we see that behavior for @xmath18 and @xmath19 non - zero is very different from the strong first order behavior found in the degenerate case .",
    "we now study a landau - ginzburg - wilson model by means of the renormalization group analysis . although the method is usually aimed to study second - order phase transitions , the lack of stable fixed points is often considered as an indication for a first - order kind of transition .    given the degeneracies of the soft modes with @xmath61 along the 4 equivalent ( 1,1,1 ) directions when @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ degeneracyj2j3 ] ) , the fluctuations of all these modes must be taken into account simultaneously .",
    "for this reason , we consider a model with an infinite - component order parameter ( extended to dimension @xmath62 ) and the fluctuations with wave - vectors close to these soft mode directions .",
    "the quadratic part of the hamiltonian is written : @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are of norm 1 and represent the @xmath65 ( 1,1,1 ) directions given in fig .",
    "[ degeneracies ] .",
    "we have 8 fields , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , with @xmath69 . if we ignore the @xmath70 term , then , when @xmath71 , all the modes with @xmath72 become simultaneously unstable .",
    "however , as in previous works,@xcite we include the small dispersion along the ( 1,1,1 ) lines , @xmath73 , to make the calculation well defined at intermediate stages . to study the degenerate case ,",
    "it will be eliminated at the end of the calculation by taking @xmath74 .",
    "the fourth - order invariants are similar to that introduced to describe the nematic smectic - c transitions@xcite and are given by :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 ensures that the total momentum of the four @xmath77 is zero .",
    "for instance , we can cancel the momentum by choosing pairs of momenta along the same ( 1,1,1 ) line , _ i.e. _ by combining @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and similarly with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "that gives a fourth - order term @xmath82 term , where @xmath68 and @xmath83 is meant for @xmath84 if @xmath85 .",
    "note that given the @xmath86 symmetry , @xmath87 does not depend upon @xmath15 , but only upon @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , we could choose the first two @xmath61 s along 1 and 3 for instance ( see fig .",
    "[ degeneracies ] ) and the other two along -2 and -4 , which gives @xmath89 .",
    "another simplifying feature that we have adopted consists of neglecting the wave - vector dependence of the coefficients @xmath87 . omitting to write the @xmath90 wave - vectors ,",

    "such a simple analysis does not say whether the transition is _ strongly _ or _ weakly _ first - order that is quite a relevant question when one comes to compare with experiments . nonetheless , the results presented in this section are compatible with the monte - carlo simulations of section [ montecarlo ] .",
