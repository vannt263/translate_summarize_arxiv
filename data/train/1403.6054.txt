    "in quantum optics , it has long been known that the amplification of light unavoidably comes with noise , due for instance to spontaneous emission in parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "this causes a fundamental problem in quantum communication , for noise is generally harmful to quantum information ( e.g. , it sets a limit on the amount of secret key bits that can be shared between two parties in quantum key distribution , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , it has been realized that the amplification process can , in principle , be made noiseless if one turns to a probabilistic ( heralded ) process instead of a deterministic process .",
    "specifically , a _ heralded noiseless amplifier _ can be devised , which brings the added noise variance arbitrarily close to zero at the price of a vanishing success probability @xcite .",
    "soon after it had been proposed , this concept of heralded noiseless amplification was successfully demonstrated in the laboratory by several teams @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the input state is typically a superposition of the vacuum and single - photon state , and the noiseless amplifier is shown to enhance the single - photon amplitude in this superposition .",
    "one can also consider a dual process , called _ heralded noiseless attenuation _ @xcite . applied to a superposition of the vacuum and single - photon state , it decreases the single - photon amplitude without adding noise .",
    "in other experiments , the noiseless amplification of a polarization qubit was also demonstrated using two noiseless amplifiers , one for each polarization mode @xcite .",
    "since the noiseless amplifier enhances the intensity of a light state without adding noise , it is naturally a good candidate to improve the performances of quantum communication or metrology protocols .",
    "its potential applications include , for instance , continuous - variable quantum error correction @xcite or phase - insensitive single - mode squeezing @xcite .",
    "it appears especially useful in the context of quantum key distribution , as it has been theoretically shown to improve the key rate of device - independent discrete - variable protocols @xcite as well as the range and tolerable excess noise of continuous - variable gaussian protocols @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the combination of a noiseless attenuator and amplifier at the two ends of a communication line provides a means to reduce the line losses without adding noise @xcite , which can be exploited in quantum key distribution ( note that the noiseless amplifier or attenuator does not necessarily need to be realized in practice , but can be emulated via a postselection procedure @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in depth the action of these noiseless transformations on arbitrary states of light .",
    "since by construction the noiseless amplifier enhances the mean field amplitude ( i.e. , the mean value of the annihilation operator ) of a coherent state , it has implicitly been assumed that this behavior is universal .",
    "surprisingly , we show here that it is not necessarily the case when non - gaussian states of light are considered . despite the fact that the mean photon number always increases via noiseless amplification ( or decreases via noiseless attenuation ) , we observe that the transformation of the mean field amplitude is more subtle . after a brief presentation of noiseless amplification ( attenuation ) in section  ii ,",
    "we derive in section  iii the transformation of the husimi q - function that it effects , which allows us to prove that the mean field amplitude of any gaussian state can only increase via noiseless amplification ( or decrease via noiseless attenuation ) , in accordance with our intuition .",
    "then , in section  iv , we analyze the counterintuitive effect of amplitude reduction by noiseless amplification ( or amplitude enhancement by noiseless attenuation ) that can be exhibited by certain non - gaussian states .",
    "we provide examples of pure and mixed non - gaussian states where this striking effect is visible .",
    "finally , section  v is devoted to the proposal of an experimental scheme which could be used to demonstrate that the mean field amplitude of a single - photon added coherent state is increased in the process of noiseless attenuation . while taking into account the inefficiency of the single - photon detector and an imperfect source",
    ", we show that this scheme could be accessible with current technology .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  vi .",
    "the noiseless amplifier probabilistically enhances the amplitude of a coherent state as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the amplitude gain .",
    "it can be described by a quantum filter @xmath2 ( a trace - decreasing cp map with a single kraus operator @xmath2 ) such that @xmath3 where the filter @xmath4 is diagonal in the fock state basis @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a real constant .",
    "the trace non - increasing condition @xmath7 implies that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which is possible only if @xmath10 ; hence , the success probability @xmath11 of this _ ideal _ noiseless amplifier vanishes .",
    "mathematically , this is because the operator @xmath12 is unbounded for @xmath1 .",
    "however , a _",
    "non - ideal _ version of the noiseless amplifier can be defined by truncating the fock state basis at @xmath13 .",
    "then , the trace non - increasing condition is fulfilled provided @xmath14 ; hence , the success probability scales as @xmath15 and can be made strictly larger than zero as long as @xmath16 is finite .",
    "in other words , a noiseless amplifier can be implemented with non - zero success probability only within a finite - dimensional subspace of the fock space .",
    "we will ignore this subtlety in the rest of this paper , and consider the ideal noiseless amplifier that is simply associated with the quantum filter @xmath12 .",
    "noiseless attenuation corresponds to the same quantum filter , but taking @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast with noiseless amplification , it corresponds to a bounded operator @xmath18 for @xmath19 , so it can be implemented exactly with a success probability that is strictly larger than zero .",
    "indeed , the quantum filter @xmath18 can be realized , for instance , by processing the input state through a beam splitter of amplitude reflectance @xmath20 whose auxiliary input port is prepared in the vacuum state @xmath21 , and then conditioning on projecting the state of the auxiliary output port onto the vacuum state @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ att ] @xcite .",
    "the lower input mode is set to vacuum and we post - select on vacuum in the lower output mode . ]",
    "it is easy to see that for an input state @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , the final state will read @xmath24 intuitively , we understand that the heralded filtering operation preferentially keeps low-@xmath25 fock states since @xmath26 exponentially decays with @xmath25 , so in this sense the state is attenuated .",
    "conversely , if we formally consider amplitude reflectance larger than @xmath27 , we will get an output state which can be interpreted as a noiselessly amplified state , where large-@xmath25 fock states are preferentially post - selected .",
    "this formal equivalence allows us to analyze the effect of both conditional operations simultaneously .",
    "let us clarify the intuition behind saying that @xmath28 amplifies the state , or @xmath26 attenuates the state .",
    "it so happens that this intuition holds true as far as the mean photon number @xmath29 is concerned , but may be contradicted if we probe the mean field amplitude @xmath30 of certain non - gaussian states ( cfr . section  iii ) . as a first step",
    ", we will prove here that @xmath29 is necessarily increased ( decreased ) under the action of noiseless amplifier @xmath28 ( attenuator @xmath26 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we consider single - mode states , but the argument can be extended to multimode states .",
    "an arbitrary input state @xmath31 can be expressed in fock basis as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the amplified ( attenuated ) state is @xmath35 and its mean photon number is given by @xmath36 we shall assume that this state is physical , i.e. , the sum in the denominator exists and has a finite value ( this is not necessarily true for some input states and @xmath1 ) .",

    "if the input state is a fock state , which is an eigenstate of the operator @xmath12 , then the mean photon number remains constant under noiseless amplification or attenuation .",
    "let us now discuss how noiseless amplification ( attenuation ) transforms gaussian states , paying a particular attention to the properties of the mean field .",
    "let us begin by recalling that the operator @xmath43 transforms a coherent state @xmath44 as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a complex number .",
    "this transformation suggests to decompose any input state into the overcomplete basis of coherent states .",
    "then , one has to evolve every component coherent state according to the transformation ( [ hnladef ] ) .",
    "a natural idea may be to use the glauber - sudarshan @xmath47 representation of the input state , that is @xmath48 if we apply the transformation of eq .",

    "we recall that @xmath64 can be viewed as the probability density for the complex outcome @xmath46 of a heterodyne measurement performed on state @xmath31 , which consists in projecting onto the coherent - state basis .",
    "it is then possible to back - propagate each coherent state through the noiseless amplifier or attenuator , as done in ref .",

    "@xcite for the noiseless amplification of a squeezed state of light , whose covariance matrix is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the squeezing parameter .",
    "we have @xmath75 implying @xmath76 so we conclude that the covariance matrix of the amplified state is that of another squeezed state @xmath77 with stronger squeezing ( the output squeezing parameter @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79 ) .",
    "the transformation of the vector of mean values , eq .  ( [ dformula ] ) , gives @xmath80 in perfect agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , we treat the case of an arbitrary gaussian input state .",
    "since the operator @xmath12 commutes with a unitary phase shift @xmath81 , we can without loss of generality assume that the covariance matrix is diagonal , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the variances of amplitude and phase quadratures , respectively , which obey the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath85 . if we insert the diagonal covariance matrix ( [ cmdiag ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dformula ] ) , we get @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the effective amplification gain is thus different for the amplitude and phase quadratures , and it depends on the variance @xmath88 of the quadrature @xmath89 , namely @xmath90 this can be rewritten as @xmath91 so that for the noiseless amplifier ( @xmath1 ) we have @xmath92 while for the noiseless attenuator ( @xmath93 ) we have @xmath94 in other words , in both cases , the effective gain is sublinear for the squeezed quadrature ( @xmath95 ) and superlinear for the antisqueezed quadrature ( @xmath96 ) . of course , in between these cases , we have simply a linear effective gain @xmath97 .",
    "at this point , we note that the squeezed quadrature with the lowest possible variance must be considered in order to find the minimum effective gain that the noiseless amplifier may exhibit , as well as the maximum effective gain that the noiseless attenuator may exhibit .",
    "let us prove that noiseless amplification always increases the amplitude of gaussian states .",
    "remember that noiseless amplification may generate unphysical states from certain input gaussian states .",
    "the amplified state is physical iff the output covariance matrix is positive definite , which is equivalent to the matrix inequalities @xmath98 .",
    "both these inequalities are equivalent to @xmath99 and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq - geff ] ) vanishes if the variance @xmath88 reaches this upper bound , making @xmath100 diverge .",
    "taking this constraint into account , the squeezed quadrature variance of the input state is lower bounded by @xmath101 which , when plugged into eq .",
    "( [ eq - geff ] ) , gives @xmath102 thus , when @xmath1 , one finds that @xmath103 for all input states leading to physical output states .",
    "similarly , by considering the case @xmath93 , one can prove that the noiseless attenuation always reduces the amplitude of gaussian states and @xmath104 . in this latter case",
    ", there is no physical constraint on the admissible input states because noiseless attenuation is a physically allowed operation that can be implemented with finite success probability on any input state .",

    "we have proven , in the previous section , that the same behavior holds true for the mean amplitude of any ( possibly mixed ) gaussian state .",
    "one could therefore naively expect that this remains true for all states .",
    "surprisingly , we will show that the mean amplitude of a non - gaussian state can actually be attenuated by noiseless amplification , or amplified by noiseless attenuation .",
    "we first illustrate this counterintuitive effect on two simple and instructive examples of states that can be expressed as superpositions of a finite number of fock states . in a third example",

    ", we will design a scheme for experimentally verifying the mean field amplification by noiseless attenuation that is robust against most experimental imperfections .    as a first example , let us consider the superposition of vacuum and single - photon state , @xmath109 where without loss of any generality we assume that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are real and @xmath112 .",
    "the coherent amplitude of this state then reads @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the annihilation operator .",

    "this effect can be understood by noting that the mean amplitude of the superpositions ( [ psi1 ] ) is maximized when @xmath121 .",
    "if the amplification gain becomes large enough , then it enhances the imbalance between the amplitudes of the vacuum and single - photon contributions , which results in effective reduction of the mean field . in the limit of very large amplification gain , the noiselessly amplified state approaches a fock state @xmath122 , whose mean field vanishes .",

    "this can be interpreted as the arising of a destructive interference between the vacuum and two - photon components in the noiselessly amplified state , hence decreasing its mean field .",
    "similarly , in case of noiseless attenuation , we can choose the parameters such that the factor @xmath136 will be very small and the gain will be very large . here ,",
    "the destructive interference that makes the mean field of the initial state very small is disturbed as a result of noiseless attenuation , hence increasing the mean field .",

    "<S> we examine the behavior of non - gaussian states of light under the action of probabilistic noiseless amplification and attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that the mean field amplitude may decrease in the process of noiseless amplification  or increase in the process of noiseless attenuation , a counterintuitive effect that gaussian states can not exhibit . this striking phenomenon could be tested with experimentally accessible non - gaussian states , such as single - photon added coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an experimental scheme , which is robust with respect to the major experimental imperfections such as inefficient single - photon detection and imperfect photon addition . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we argue that the observation of mean field amplification by noiseless attenuation should be feasible with current technology . </S>"
