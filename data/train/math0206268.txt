    "in 1876 , harnack  @xcite established the bound of @xmath0 for the number of ovals of a smooth curve of genus @xmath1 in @xmath2 and showed this bound is sharp by constructing curves with this number of ovals . since",
    "then such curves with maximally many ovals , or m - curves , have been primary objects of interest in the topological study of real algebraic plane curves ( part of the 16th problem of hilbert )  @xcite .",
    "we introduce and begin the study of maximally inflected curves , which may be considered to be analogs of @xmath3-curves among rational curves , in the sense that , like the classical maximal condition , maximal inflection implies non - trivial restrictions on the topology .",
    "the case of a maximally inflected curve that we are most interested in is a rational plane curve of degree @xmath4 , all of whose @xmath5 inflection points are real .",
    "more generally , consider a parameterization of a rational curve of degree @xmath4 in @xmath6 with @xmath7 ; a map from @xmath8 to @xmath6 of degree @xmath4 .",

    "a _ maximally inflected curve _ is , by definition , a parameterized real rational curve , all of whose ramification points are real .",

    "would imply the existence of maximally inflected curves , for every possible placement of the ramification points .",
    "a.  eremenko and a.  gabrielov  @xcite proved the conjecture of shapiro and shapiro in the special case when @xmath13 . in that case , a maximally inflected curve is a real rational function , all of whose critical points are real .    when @xmath14 and for special types of ramification ( including flexes and cusps of plane curves ) and when the ramification points are clustered very near to one another , there do exist maximally inflected curves , by a result in the real schubert calculus  @xcite .",
    "when the degree @xmath4 is even and the curve has only simple flexes , but arbitrarily placed , the existence of such curves follows from the results of eremenko and gabrielov on the degree of the wronski map  @xcite .",

    "we deduce from the klein  @xcite and plcker  @xcite formulas that the number of real nodes of such a curve is however at most @xmath17 .",
    "then we show that this bound is sharp .",
    "we use e.  shustin s theorem on combinatorial patchworking for singular curves  @xcite to construct maximally inflected curves that realize the lower bound of 0 real nodes , and another theorem of shustin concerning deformations of singular curves  @xcite to construct maximally inflected curves with the upper bound of @xmath17 real nodes .",
    "we also classify such curves in degree 4 , and discuss some aspects of the classification of quintics .",
    "the connection between the schubert calculus and rational curves in projective space ( linear series on @xmath8 ) originated in work of g.  castelnuovo  @xcite on @xmath1-nodal rational curves .",
    "this led to the use of schubert calculus in brill - noether theory ( see chapter  5 of  @xcite for an elaboration ) . in a closely related vein ,",
    "the schubert calculus features in the local study of flattenings of curves in singularity theory  @xcite . in turn",
    ", the theory of limit linear series of d.  eisenbud and j.  harris  @xcite provides essential tools to show reality of the special schubert calculus  @xcite , which gives the existence of many types of maximally inflected curves .",
    "the constructions we give using patchworking and gluing show the existence of real solutions to some problems in the schubert calculus .",
    "in particular , they show the existence of maximally inflected plane curves with given type of ramification when the degree @xmath4 is odd , extending the results of eremenko - gabrielov on the degree of the wronski map  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we describe the connection between the schubert calculus and maps from @xmath8 with specified points of ramification . in section 2",
    ", we show the existence of some special types of maximally inflected curves and discuss the conjecture of shapiro and shapiro in this context .",
    "we restrict our attention to maximally inflected plane curves in section 3 , establishing bounds on the number of solitary points and real nodes . in section 4 , we construct maximally inflected curves with extreme numbers of real nodes and in section 5 , we discuss the classification of quartics . in section 6 ,",
    "we consider some aspects of the classification of quintics .",
    "we thank d. pecker who suggested using duals of curves in the proof of corollary  [ cor : bounds ] and e. shustin who explained to us his work on deformations of singular curves and suggested the construction of section  [ sec : patchworking ] at the oberwolfach workshop `` new perspectives in the topology of real algebraic varieties '' in september 2000 .",

    "the curve @xmath430 constructed from these data by proposition  [ prop : shustin ] has @xmath5 flexes and @xmath16 solitary points as claimed .",
    "first , since the facet curves @xmath431 and @xmath422 each have @xmath404 solitary points , @xmath430 has @xmath432 solitary points , and so is rational ( in fact , the solitary points correspond to internal integer points of the newton polygon ) . from the newton portrait of @xmath433 , we see that @xmath430 meets the @xmath339-axis in @xmath4 points .",
    "each facet @xmath434 contributes 2 points of intersection of @xmath430 with the @xmath368-axis .",

    "the facet @xmath379 contributes an additional point , and when @xmath4 is even , the facet @xmath438 ( corresponding to @xmath439 ) contributes one point .    as a result , the curve @xmath430 has three separate segments , each intersecting a different coordinate axis in @xmath4 consecutive points going in the same order on the curve and on the axis .",
    "thus , by counting the whitney indices by means of the gauss map we find at least @xmath115 flexes on each segment .",
    "hence , the curve constructed has @xmath5 flexes .",

    "@xmath442    another patchworking is via gluing parameterizations of the facet curves @xmath240 and @xmath1 ( which are rational ) .",
    "since the dual graph of the triangulation is a chain , it is sufficient to have a gluing construction for a pair of rational plane curves intersecting transversally . for that purpose",
    ", one can pick parameterizations @xmath360 and @xmath365 such that @xmath443 and consider , for generic @xmath444 and sufficiently small @xmath319 the rational curves @xmath445 given by @xmath446 . the flexes and the nodes are preserved under this patchworking construction , since they are stable under small deformations .",
    "in figure  [ fig : cubics ] we saw that a plane cubic with 3 real flexes has a solitary point and no nodes and a plane cubic with one real cusp has no nodes .",
    "these are the only possible maximally inflected cubics and they exhaust all the possibilities allowed by corollary  [ cor : bounds ] .",
    "consider now quartics whose only ramifications are flexes and cusps .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath266 allowed by corollary  [ cor : bounds ] for quartics is 1 , so maximally inflected quartics have no complex nodes and either 1 or 0 real nodes .",
    "table  [ table : one ] summarizes the possible numbers @xmath220 of real nodes and @xmath221 of solitary points .",
    "the third column of table  [ t : last ] records an interesting global phenomenon we have observed .",

    "we observe that that the number of these @xmath166 curves having a given number of solitary points appears to depend only upon the necklace , and not on the placement of the ramification .",
    "we record this in the third column , with the columns corresponding to the possible values of @xmath447 between 3 and 6 , from left to right .",
    "the last two columns of table  [ t : last ] give the number @xmath105 of rational quintics of that type having a given choice of ramification , and the number of choices of ramification for which we computed all @xmath105 quintics and determined their numbers of solitary points , complex nodes , and real nodes .",
    "in particular , if conjecture  [ conj : non - degen ] ( concerning non - degeneracy ) held for quintics , then the number of curves having a given ramification and given number of solitary points depends only on the necklace of the ramification , that is , only on the relative positions of the points of ramification .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion of theorem  [ t : quart - isotopy ] for quartics , but it is a weaker phenomenon , as the topology of the embedding of a quintic can change under an isotopy .",
    "( we give an example below . )",
    "if conjecture  [ conj : non - degen ] held for quintics , then similar arguments as given in the proof of theorem  [ t : quart - isotopy ] concerning isolating solitary points by bitangents and bzout s theorem may suffice to prove conjecture  [ c : quintic - solitary ] .",
    "an instructive example is provided by quintics whose ramification consists of three cusps at @xmath448 and @xmath449 and three flexes at 0 and @xmath450 , where @xmath451 . for these the cusps and flexes alternate , and for a given choice of ramification , there are 6 curves . letting @xmath151 vary",

    "the other curves in two of these three families each have a single node and two complex nodes .",
    "the latter two families differ only by reparameterization of their curves .",
    "we display curves from one of them at the values @xmath453 , and @xmath454 .",
    "all three have a cusp at infinity .",
    "the line joining the complex nodes is drawn in the first and third pictures . despite appearences ,",
    "it is not tangent to the curve .",
    "if it were tangent , then it would have intersection number at least 6 with the curve , which contradicts bzout s theorem . @xmath455 the curves in the third family",
    "have one node and two complex nodes when @xmath456 , but three nodes for @xmath457 .",
    "we display curves from this family at the values @xmath458 , and @xmath459 .",
    "the horizontal line in the third picture is the real line meeting the two complex nodes , and all three have a flex at infinity .",
    "@xmath460 we remark that these curves , like those shown in section 4 and in figure  [ fig : quintics ] below , were drawn using the computer algebra systems maple and singular  @xcite .",
    "we first computed the centers of projection giving all curves with a given ramification , formulating and solving the problem in local coordinates for the grassmannian .",
    "given the centers , we computed parameterizations and then set up and solved the equations for the double points .",
    "those whose embedding we needed to study , we plotted , and for those displayed in this paper , we created postscript files which were then further edited to enhance important features , such as flexes and solitary points .",
    "we classify the possible chord diagrams of maximally inflected quintics and discuss the possible topology of the image as a subset of @xmath231 ( ignoring possible solitary points ) .",
    "since the proof we give does not use flexes , it also classifies chord diagrams of quintics with at most three nodes .",
    "* by corollary  [ cor : bounds ] , a maximally inflected quintic can have at most three nodes .",
    "recall that the degree of any ( piecewise smooth ) closed curve in @xmath231 is well - defined modulo 2 , and this degree is additive , again modulo 2 .",
    "consider an image of @xmath148 in @xmath231 with a node .",
    "under an orientation from @xmath148 , the node has two incoming arcs and two outgoing arcs .",
    "we may split the curve into two pieces at the node by joining an incoming arc of one branch with the outgoing arc of the other branch .",
    "we illustrate this splitting below .",
    "@xmath462    the first case to consider is that of a quintic with two nodes . in a chord diagram of such a quintic , the two chords can not cross .",
    "if they did , then split the quintic at a node .",
    "the resulting two closed curves have exactly one point of intersection ( the other node ) , and so each piece necessarily has odd degree .",
    "it follows that their union , the original quintic , has even degree , a contradiction .",
    "suppose now that we have a quintic with three nodes .",
    "the argument we just gave forbids any chord diagrams containing a chord that meets exactly one other chord , and thus the only possibilities are as claimed .",
    "concluding , we get only one chord diagram with 2 chords ( two non - intersecting chords ) and three chord diagrams with 3 chords ( three pairwise intersecting chords , three sides of a hexagon , and three parallel chords ) .",
    "recall that a pseudoline is a closed curve in @xmath231 which has odd degree and whose complement is connected ( it is a one - sided curve ) . an oval is a two - sided closed curve which necessarily has even degree .",
    "we enumerate the possible topological embeddings of @xmath148 given by a maximally inflected quintic , beginning with the classification of chord diagrams .",
    "if there is a single node , then the curve must look like a pseudoline with a loop .",
    "splitting the curve at the node and applying the jordan curve theorem to the loop in the complement of the pseudoline shows that the loop is two - sided .",
    "thus there is a unique possible topological embedding .",
    "such a maximally inflected quintic is shown in figure  [ fig : quintics](a ) .",
    "we do not draw the solitary points .    now consider a quintic with two nodes whose chord diagram ( necessarily ) consists of two non - intersecting chords .",
    "we split the curve at both nodes to obtain three closed curves that meet only at the nodes .",
    "deforming them slightly away from the nodes , we see that at most one is a pseudoline ( for any two pseudolines meet ) , and so exactly one is a pseudoline , as the original curve was a quintic . as before ,",
    "the other components are then 2-sided ovals .",
    "these ovals can not be nested . a line through a solitary point or a singular ramification point ( a maximally inflected quintic must have one such point ) that meets the nest has intersection number at least 6 with the quintic , contradicting bzout s theorem .",
    "thus there are two possibilities .",
    "either the pseudoline meets both ovals ( see figure  [ fig : quintics](b ) ) , or the pseudoline meets only one oval , which then meets the other ( see figure  [ fig : quintics](c ) ) . as before the ovals can not be nested .",
    "each open circle in figure  [ fig : quintics](c ) represents two flexes that have nearly merged to create a planar point .",
    "suppose now that there are three pairwise intersecting chords .",
    "if we split the curve at _ one _ node , we obtain a pseudoline and an oval , which have two additional points of intersection .",
    "there is only one possibility for this configuration , and we have already seen it in the last pictures in each of sections  [ s : kkkiii ] and  [ s : kis ] .",
    "we display yet another such curve below in figure  [ fig : quintics](d ) .",
    "if the three chords are three sides of a hexagon , we may split the curve at each of its nodes to obtain a pseudoline and three loops .",
    "one piece meets the other three , and these three are disjoint from each other .",
    "if the pseudoline meets the three loops , there are two possibilities for the disposition of the three loops along the pseudoline .",
    "either they alternate ( as shown in figure  [ fig : quintics](e ) or in figure  [ fig : shustin ] ) or they do not .",
    "we forbid the possibility of non - alternating loops in proposition  [ p : forbid ] below .",
    "we have not yet observed such a quintic where the pseudoline meets one loop , which then meets the other two loops . a schematic for this",
    "is figure  [ fig : notfound](a ) .",
    "lastly , we have the possibility of three parallel chords .",
    "as before , we split the curve at each of its nodes to obtain one pseudoline and three ovals , and the ovals can not be nested .",
    "two components meet two others , and two meet exactly one other .",
    "either the pseudoline either meets two ovals ( see figure  [ fig : quintics](f ) ) , or it meets only one .",
    "this last case has not yet been observed , but we provide a schematic of it in figure  [ fig : notfound](b )          * proof .",
    "* suppose that we have a maximally inflected quintic whose embedding consists of a pseudoline with three loops attached to the pseudoline .",
    "such a curve has three nodes . by corollary  [ cor : generalbounds ]",
    ", a maximally inflected quintic with three nodes may have only flexes , planar points , cusps , or a point with ramification sequence @xmath466 .",
    "let @xmath214 be its number of cusps , which is at most 3otherwise corollary  [ cor : bounds ] restricts the number of nodes to be at most 2 .",
    "since it must have at least @xmath467 solitary points and @xmath468 double points in all , the curve has @xmath467 solitary points , or 3 solitary points plus cusps .",
    "gudkov s extension  @xcite of brusotti s theorem  @xcite allows us to independently smooth the cusps and nodes to obtain a smooth quintic .",
    "we smooth each cusp as in the local model of figure  [ fig : smooth ] , smooth each node to detach its loop from the psuedoline , and smooth each solitary point to obtain an oval .",
    "thus we obtain a smooth plane quintic with 6 ovals , which is an @xmath3-curve .",
    "furthermore , the three ovals arising from solitary points or cusps are distinguished .",
    "pick a point inside each of the three distinguished ovals , connect each pair by a line and study the configuration of these lines with respect to the quintic . by bzout s theorem ,",
    "each of these bisecants intersects the one - sided component at one point and its two ovals at two points each .",
    "hence , the configuration does not depend on the choice of the points .",
    "since all @xmath3-quintics are deformation equivalent , i.e. , belong to one connected family of nonsingular quintics ( see @xcite , a little correction of the proof is given in @xcite ) , the configuration does not depend on the choice of the @xmath3-quintic either . examining any of the various",
    "known examples , one finds the configuration like the picture below , where we have drawn the lines joining the solitary points of a rational quintic ( the two pictures are for similar curves in different projections ) , leaving the smoothing to the imagination of the reader .",

    "the bisecants form four triangles in @xmath231 , with a distinguished triangle not meeting the pseudoline and containing no ovals ( i.e. , no ovals arising from the loops ) .",
    "the pseudoline divides each of the other triangles into two components , with the oval in the component adjacent to that edge of the distinguished triangle which is not intersected by the pseudoline .",
