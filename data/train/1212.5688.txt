    "for the purpose of controlling the transport and the scattering of a single photon in a full quantum fashion , much progress has been made in confined atom - photon hybrid systems  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the transport of a single photon can be coherently manipulated by the interaction between the photon and the doped natural or artificial atoms in low - dimensional quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding physical implementations could be realized in several different ways , such as : defected photonic crystals  @xcite and superconducting transmission line resonators  @xcite .",
    "so far , many investigations have been done on one - dimensional ( 1d ) atom - photon hybrid system  @xcite .",
    "for example , people find that with a tunable two - level atom inside one of the cavities , the transmission and reflection of a single photon can be well controlled in 1d coupled cavity array ( cca ) @xcite . in order to fabricate the integrated all - optical on - chip devices ,",
    "it is also necessary to study the control of the photon transport in two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , to our best knowledge , this kind of investigation is still lack .    in this paper",
    "we begin to study the control of a single - photon transport in a 2d cca with atoms .",
    "the 2d cca is a good candidate for the 2d quantum networks .",
    "it has been experimentally realized in defected photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "the photon localization was observed in such a system with disorder @xcite .",
    "many authors proposed that the 2d cca with atoms can be used on quantum information @xcite and the quantum simulation of many - body physics , such as the superfluid - mott transition @xcite and quantum hall effect @xcite , _ etc_.",
    "we investigate the scattering of a single photon in the 2d cca , with two - level atoms which are periodically located in one or two rows of the cavities .",
    "it is pointed out that , the research for such a problem is not only helpful for the development of control technique for photon transport in a 2d quantum network , but also important for the investigations of collective effects of periodically located atoms on the single - photon scattering . since dicke s initial work on super - radiance @xcite , many authors have studied the influence of the collective behaviors of atoms on the spontaneous radiation process @xcite .",
    "most of these researches focused on the cases where the atoms are randomly distributed @xcite , or confined in a region which is much smaller than the cube of the photonic wave length @xcite , or the systems with finite atoms @xcite .",
    "here we consider the _ scattering _ process of a single photon , and focus on the effects of infinite number of _ periodically _ distributed atoms , with the distance between two nearest atoms comparable with the photonic wave length .",
    "our research is also closely related to the recent experiments of the single x - ray photon scattering on the layered nuclear material , where the @xmath0fe nuclei are periodically distributed @xcite .    for the 2d cca system",
    ", we analytically solve the single - photon scattering problem , and obtain a clear understanding of the physics behind the collective effects .",
    "we find that when the atoms are located in one row of the cavities in the 2d cca , due to the translational symmetry of the atomic distribution , the atomic collective energy shift induced by the photon - atom interaction ( i.e. , collective lamb shift ) @xcite is related to the photonic density of states ( dos ) of a 1d cca , rather than the photonic dos of a 2d cca .",
    "furthermore , the collective lamb shift diverges when the incident momentum of the photon takes some special values . in these cases",
    "the photon can not be scattered by the atoms . when the atoms are located in two rows of the cavities , as a result of the periodical structure ,",
    "only two atomic collective states are coupled to the photonic states .",
    "effective coupling between these two collective states , which is described by the non - diagonal elements of the self - energy matrix , can be induced by the photon - atom interaction .",
    "we can thus obtain two dressed states with different effective energies , which are the eigen - states of the self - energy matrix .",
    "the maximum of the scattering probability appears when the incident photon is resonant with one of these two states .",
    "similar as the atomic susceptibility in the system with electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) , the scattering probability has a double - peak behavior as a function of photon - atom detuning .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we investigate the single - photon scattering in a 2d cca with one layer of atoms , and discuss the collective shift of the atomic energy . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the case with two layers of atoms , and illustrate the eit - like behavior of the scattering probability .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in sec .",
    "some details of our calculation are presented in the appendix .",
    "we consider a 2d array of identical single - mode cavities as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we further assume that the photons can hop between neighbor cavities",
