    "the present study concerns interfaces that are incommensurate .",
    "a situation far more common in nature , it also naturally exhibits more interesting tribological features than commensurate ones.@xcite we focus especially on static friction , the minimal sliding force necessary to depin one lattice from the other .",
    "the main issue we address here is the nature of static friction against sliding of a 2d lattice onto a 2d incommensurate corrugation .",
    "the reference point for our understanding is the 1d case , epitomized by the so - called frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model , consisting of a harmonic chain of classical point particles in a static sinusoidal potential , an idealized system whose physics has been very widely studied and understood.@xcite in 1d , the incommensurability between interparticle spacing and sinusoidal potential wavelength gives rise to a potential - induced deformation of the chain particle position , that can be described by a deformation of the chain s phase @xmath7 relative to that of the potential , from the non - interacting straight line of slope @xmath8 to a staircase with the same mean slope but formed by nearly horizontal , approximately constant phase terraces .",
    "these commensurate domains are separated by steps in the relative phase , often called solitons ( or kinks ) and antisolitons ( or antikinks ) , where most of the misfit stress is concentrated .",
    "this 1d system is known to display a remarkable dynamical phase transition , first described by aubry.@xcite when the corrugation is weak , below a critical magnitude , when the soliton widths are comparable to or larger than that of terraces and the overall phase modulation is small , the fk chain exhibits no pinning , the static friction is zero . in this regime one",
    "finds particles at all potential values , and all possible phases of the chain particles are accessible in dynamics .",
    "since the total potential energy is independent of the phase , @xmath9 = 0 , the chain as a whole can be displaced by any infinitesimal force .",
    "this absence of static friction has been dubbed `` superlubricity''.@xcite however , above a critical corrugation magnitude , whose value depends on precise parameters and incommensurability , the chain develops a nonzero static friction through a continuous `` aubry '' phase transition .",
    "the essence of the aubry transition is that the probability to find a particle exactly at a potential maximum drops mathematically to zero ( of course at @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , even if @xmath11 is still zero , this new dynamical constraint limits phase - space accessibility , breaking ergodicity in a way similar to a glass transition , with the onset of static friction and of chain pinning against free sliding .",
    "this transition is of a dynamical nature , so that even if the step - terrace deformation of the chain s phase @xmath7 becomes more marked in the pinned state , it still remains similar in nature to the superlubric one .",
    "although suggestive , the static structure difference between the two does not reveal the essence of the transition .",
    "a more relevant signature is provided by the sliding friction . in the superlubric state ,",
    "sliding of the chain occurs under any applied force however small , and can be envisaged as a state of flow of the solitons .",
    "soliton motion causes dissipation , increasing with speed in correspondence with increasing emission of phonons . in the pinned state ,",
    "chain sliding occurs only once the static friction force is overcome , at which point the sliding dynamics becomes generally quite different from the superlubric state .    in view of this well - known 1d case",
    ", it is physically clear that a qualitatively similar state of affairs should also occur in 2d incommensurate sliders .",
    "that is actually a case much more relevant in practice , where one expects free , superlubric sliding for weak corrugation , and pinning with stick - slip for strong corrugation .",
    "superlubricity is documented in several real 2d systems .",
    "very small values of the static friction force @xmath12 were observed for a rotationally misaligned graphene flake sliding over graphite,@xcite the pinned configuration corresponding to the aligned and therefore commensurate case .",
    "superlubricity and consequent ultra - low dynamic friction has also been demonstrated or implied in a number of cases , such as also telescopic sliding among carbon nanotubes,@xcite in cluster nanomanipulation studies,@xcite and in the sliding of rare - gas adsorbates.@xcite however , there is no experimental case so far exhibiting a clear superlubric - pinned transition among 2d incommensurate sliders under fixed geometrical conditions .",
    "an experimental system of fresh relevance where that goal might be pursued is represented precisely by two - dimensional crystalline colloidal monolayers sliding over a laser - induced periodic corrugation potential .",
    "measurements@xcite and computer simulations@xcite of colloidal monolayers interacting with a laser - induced periodic potential demonstrated the possibility to attain negligible values of the static friction force in incommensurate geometries .",
    "therefore a study of the transition from the superlubric to the pinned state , done at constant lattice mismatch , and at constant mutual alignment is potentially feasible for sliding colloid monolayers .",
    "these systems are excellent candidates as they allow to change all the relevant parameters of the interface : the corrugation strength @xmath0 and the colloidal crystal lattice parameter @xmath4 , which sets the mismatch ratio @xmath13 given the optical potential periodicity @xmath14 , fixed by the laser .",
    "the mutual alignment or misalignment between the colloid and the optical lattices is decided by energetics . as was established by a recent study , a small misalignment generally prevails , directly detectable by the colloid moir pattern.@xcite this kind of misalignment , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_interfaces]c , is well established in surface - adsorbed rare - gas monolayers.@xcite    the question we address here , only marginally touched upon so far@xcite is whether at constant mismatch the weak- and the strong - corrugation regimes will again or will not be separated by a well - defined superlubric  pinned phase transition of the same type as that described by aubry in 1d  the only case where a mathematical treatment has been worked out .",
    "colloid monolayers offers the ideal chance to verify this point if not analytically at least numerically in a realistic and relevant case .    for a 2d triangular crystal monolayer interacting with a mismatched rigid corrugation periodic potential the 1d soliton - terrace staircase",
    "is replaced by a 2d superlattice of nearly commensurate domains .",
    "the domains are separated by soliton ( antisoliton ) misfit dislocation lines , depending on the specific value of @xmath2 , and of the misalignment angle . in triangular symmetry ,",
    "three families of soliton lines , oriented at @xmath15120 degrees from one another , will generally coexist .",
    "the coincidence plot between the two lattices ( monolayer and periodic corrugation ) realizes a moir pattern , consisting of a patchwork of nearly commensurate , roughly hexagonal domains separated by the soliton lines , which concentrate the mismatch of the two lattices.@xcite like in 1d , the sliding of the 2d monolayer enacts a  flow  of the solitons in the moir pattern . a spontaneous angular misalignment , which when present lowers the energy by increasing the interdigitation of the two lattices , strongly modifies that pattern and correspondingly increases friction.@xcite    the main questions which we plan to address here are : ( a ) is there a sharp superlubric - pinned transition in the sliding of incommensurate colloid monolayers for increasing corrugation strength ?",
    "( b ) is this 2d transition continuous and critical ( as in 1d ) , or first order ?",
    "( c ) does the spontaneous misalignment affect the transition , and when so , to what effect ?",

    "their disappearance is therefore responsible for the arisal of static friction in the pinned state .",
    "experimentally , vanishingly small values of @xmath12 have been observed in 2d incommensurate structures,@xcite but the realization and the analysis of the transition between superlubric and pinned states is missing to our knowledge .",
    "the present work suggests the possibility to pursue and investigate in detail the superlubric - pinned transition by gradually increasing the optical - lattice strength .",
    "additional phenomena may be accessed by forcing rotations and modifying the natural misalignment of the colloidal crystal with respect to the optical lattice .",
    "since the superlubric phase at @xmath103 survives up to larger corrugation values , rotations of mismatched sliders initially away from the optimal orientation might in fact end up in reentrant pinning as soon as @xmath65 is hit , in a way similar to the matched case ( @xmath3 , @xmath104 ) of a rotated graphene flake sliding over graphite.@xcite    this work was mainly supported under the erc advanced grant no .",

    "since we are adopting pbc , our systems are commensurate and therefore ultimately pinned .",
    "a fine search at @xmath105 , below and close to @xmath87 , shows that the static friction force is indeed finite there , being @xmath106 .",
    "this `` pinning transition '' is marked by a sudden increase in @xmath12 by two - three orders of magnitude when increasing @xmath0 above the critical value @xmath87 . on the opposite side , for @xmath107 , @xmath12 is so small that it is quite hard to measure ."

    "<S> two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystalline colloidal monolayers sliding over a laser - induced optical lattice providing the periodic `` corrugation '' potential recently emerged as a new tool for the study of friction between ideal crystal surfaces . here </S>",

    "<S> if the colloid and the optical lattices are mutually commensurate , the colloid sliding is always pinned by static friction ; but when they are incommensurate the presence or absence of pinning can be expected to depend upon the system parameters , like in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems . if a 2d analogy to the mathematically established aubry transition of one - dimensional systems were to hold , an increasing periodic corrugation strength @xmath0 should turn an initially free - sliding , superlubric colloid into a pinned state , where the static friction force goes from zero to finite through a well - defined dynamical phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem by the simulated sliding of a realistic model 2d colloidal lattice , confirming the existence of a clear and sharp superlubric - pinned transition for increasing corrugation strength . unlike the 1d aubry transition which is continuous </S>",

    "<S> the transition entails a structural character , with a sudden increase of the colloid - colloid interaction energy , accompanied by a compensating downward jump of the colloid - corrugation energy . </S>",
    "<S> the transition value for the corrugation amplitude @xmath0 depends upon the misalignment angle @xmath1 between the optical and the colloidal lattices , superlubricity surviving until larger corrugations for angles away from the energetically favored orientation , which is itself generally slightly misaligned , as shown in recent work . </S>",
