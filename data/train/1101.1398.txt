    "during the past half century , economists have made considerable progress in understanding the theoretical structure of equilibrium strategic behavior under market mechanisms , such as auctions , when the number of potential participants is relatively small ; see @xcite for a comprehensive presentation and evaluation of progress .",
    "one analytic device , commonly used to describe bidder motivation at single - object auctions , is a continuous random variable which represents individual - specific heterogeneity in valuations .",
    "the conceptual experiment involves each bidder s receiving a draw from a distribution of valuations .",
    "conditional on his draw , a bidder is then assumed to act purposefully , maximizing either the expected profit or the expected utility of profit from winning the auction .",
    "another frequently - made assumption is that the valuation draws of bidders are independent and that the bidders are _ ex ante _ symmetric  their draws being from the same distribution of valuations .",
    "this framework is often referred to as the _ symmetric independent private - values paradigm _",
    "( symmetric ipvp ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "a researcher can then focus on a representative agent s decision rule when describing equilibrium behavior .    at many real - world auctions , the latent valuations of potential bidders are probably dependent in some way . in auction theory ,",
    "it has been assumed that dependence satisfies _ affiliation _ , a term coined by @xcite .",
    "affiliation is a condition concerning the joint distribution of signals .",
    "often , affiliation is described using the intuition presented by milgrom and weber : `` roughly , this [ affiliation ] means that a high value of one bidder s estimate makes high values of the others estimates more likely . ''",
    "thus described , affiliation seems like a relatively innocuous condition . in the case of continuous random variables , following the path blazed by @xcite ,",
    "some refer to affiliation as _ multivariate total positivity of order two _ , or @xmath0 for short . essentially , under affiliation , with continuous random variables , the off - diagonal elements of the hessian of the logarithm of the joint probability density function of signals are all nonnegative , that is , the joint probability density function is log - supermodular . under joint normality of signals",
    ", affiliation requires that _ all _ the pair - wise covariances be weakly positive .",
    "how is affiliation related to other forms of dependence ?",
    "consider two continuous random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , having joint probability density function @xmath3 as well as conditional probability density functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 and conditional cumulative distribution functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "introduce @xmath8 and @xmath9 , functions that are nondecreasing in their arguments .",
    "@xcite has noted that affiliation implies ( a )  @xmath10 $ ] is decreasing in @xmath11 ( and @xmath12 in the other case ) , often referred to as a decreasing _ inverse hazard rate _ , which implies ( b ) @xmath13 is nonincreasing in @xmath11 ( and @xmath12 in the other case ) , also referred to as _ positive regression dependence _ , which implies ( c ) @xmath14 is nonincreasing in @xmath11 ( and @xmath12 in the other case ) , also referred to as _ left - tail decreasing _ in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , which implies ( d ) @xmath15 $ ] is positive , which implies that ( e ) @xmath16 $ ] is positive , which implies ( f ) @xmath17 is positive .",
    "the important point to note is that affiliation is a much stronger form of dependence than positive covariance .",
    "in addition , @xcite has demonstrated that , within the set of all signal distributions , the set satisfying affiliation is small , both in the topological sense and in the measure - theoretic sense .",
    "affiliation delivers several predictions and results : first , under affiliation , the existence and uniqueness of a monotone pure - strategy equilibrium ( mpse ) is guaranteed .",
    "also , four commonly - studied auction formats  the oral , ascending - price ( often referred to by economists as the _ english _ ) and the second - price , sealed - bid ( often referred to by economists as the _ vickrey _ ) as well as two first - price ones  can be ranked in terms of the revenues they can be expected to generate . specifically , the expected revenues at english auctions are weakly greater than those at vickrey auctions which are greater than those at first - price auctions  either the sealed - bid or the oral , descending - price ( often referred to by economists as the _ dutch _ ) formats .",
    "note , however , that when bidders are asymmetric , their valuation draws being from different marginal distributions , these rankings no longer apply .",
    "in fact , in general , very little can be said about the revenue - generating properties of the various auction formats and pricing rules under asymmetries .    empirically investigating equilibrium behavior at auctions when",
    "latent valuations are affiliated has challenged researchers for some time .",
    "@xcite showed that identification has been impossible to establish in many models when affiliation is present .",
    "in fact , laffont and vuong demonstrated that any model within the affiliated - values paradigm ( avp ) is observationally equivalent to a model within the affiliated private - values paradigm ( apvp ) .",
    "for this reason , virtually all empirical workers who have considered some form of dependence have worked within the apvp .",
    "only a few researchers have dealt explicitly with models within the apvp .",
    "in particular , @xcite have demonstrated nonparametric identification within the conditional ipvp , a special case of the apvp , while @xcite have demonstrated nonparametric identification within the apvp .",
    "one of the problems that li et al .",
    "faced when implementing their approach is that nonparametric kernel - smoothed estimators are often slow to converge .",
    "in addition , li et al . do not impose affiliation in their estimation strategy , so the first - order condition used in their two - step estimation strategy need not constitute an equilibrium .",
    "@xcite have sought to address some of these technical problems using semiparametric methods which sacrifice the full generality of the nonparametric approach _ in lieu _ of additional structure .    to date , except for @xcite , no one has attempted to examine , empirically , models in which the private values are potentially dependent , but not necessarily affiliated . incidentally , using data from sequential english auctions of two different objects , brendstrup and paarsch found weak evidence against affiliation in the valuation draws of two objects for the same bidder .",
    "@xcite has noted that , within the private - values paradigm , affiliation is unnecessary to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a mpse .",
    "in fact , he has demonstrated existence and uniqueness of a mpse under a weaker form of dependence , one where the inverse hazard rate is decreasing in the conditioned argument .    because affiliation is unnecessary to guarantee existence and uniqueness of bidding strategies in models of first - price auctions with private values , expected revenue predictions based on empirical models in which affiliation",
    "is imposed are potentially biased . knowing whether valuations are affiliated is central to ranking auction formats in terms of the expected revenues generated",
    ". in the absence of affiliation , the expected - revenue rankings delivered by the _ linkage principle _ of @xcite need not hold : the expected - revenue rankings across auctions formats remain an empirical question . thus , investigating the empirical validity of affiliation appears both an important and a useful exercise .    in next section of this paper",
    "we present a brief description of affiliation and its soldier ",
    "total positivity of order two ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "subsequently , following the theoretical work of de castro ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who introduced the notion of the grid distribution , in section [ s3 ] we construct a tractable empirical model of equilibrium behavior at first - price auctions when the private valuations of bidders are potentially dependent , but not necessarily affiliated . ) , which is the focus of this paper . ] in section [ s4 ] we develop a test of affiliation , which is based on grid distributions , rather than kernel - smoothing methods , thus avoiding the drawback encountered by li , perrigne and vuong ( @xcite , @xcite ) , while in section [ s5 ] we apply our methods in an empirical investigation of low - price , sealed - bid , procurement - contract auctions held by the department of transportation in the state of michigan , and do not reject the null hypothesis of affiliation .",
    "this information is potentially useful to a policy maker .",
    "the apparent high degree of estimated affiliation also explains why low levels of observed competition are often sufficient to maintain relatively low profit margins : strong affiliation is akin to fierce competition .",
    "under strong affiliation , a potential winner knows that his nearest competitor probably has a valuation ( cost ) close to his , and this disciplines his bidding behavior : he becomes more aggressive than under independence .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ s6 ] , the final section of the paper .",
    "the results of a small - scale monte carlo to investigate the numerical as well as small - sample properties of our proposed test are reported in the supplemental document@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , affiliation is often described using an example with two random variables that can take on either a low or a high value .",
    "the two random variables are affiliated if high ( low ) values of each are more likely to occur than high and low or low and high values .",
    "a commonly - used graph of the four possible outcomes in a two - bidder auction game with two values is depicted in figure [ fig:21 ] .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 points are more likely than the @xmath22 or @xmath23 points . letting @xmath24 denote",
    "the probability of @xmath25 , affiliation in this example then reduces to @xmath18viz .",
    ", @xmath26 put another way , @xmath18 means that the determinant of the matrix @xmath27 must be weakly positive .",
    "independence in valuations obviously satisfies the lower bound on this determinental inequality .",
    "note , too , that affiliation restricts distributions to a part of the simplex depicted in figure [ fig:22 ] . in that figure , it is the region of the simplex that appears below a semi - circle rising from the line where @xmath28 equals one . in order to draw this figure , we needed to impose symmetry , so @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal ; thus , the intercept for @xmath29 is one half .",
    "conditions that are weaker than affiliation , but that also guarantee existence and uniqueness of equilibrium , are depicted in figure [ fig:22 ] , too . in fact , in this simple example , the entire simplex satisfies these weaker conditions . in richer examples , however , it is a subset of the simplex , but one that contains the set of affiliated distributions .",
    "thus , the assumption of affiliation could be important in determining the revenues a seller can expect from a particular auction format .",
    "@xcite have discussed geometric representations of @xmath31 distributions , like some of those considered here .",
    "their representations are based on tetrahedrons , while ours reduce to triangles because of symmetry .",
    "another important point to note is that affiliation is a global restriction . to see the importance of this fact ,",
    "introduce the valuation @xmath32 for each bidder ; five additional points then appear , as is depicted in figure [ fig:23 ] .",
    "affiliation requires that the probabilities at all collections of four points satisfy @xmath18 ; that is , the following additional six inequalities must hold : @xmath33 of course , symmetry would imply that @xmath24 equal @xmath34 for all @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so the joint mass function for two bidders and three valuations under symmetric affiliation can be written as the following matrix : @xmath37 where the determinants of all @xmath38 submatrices must be positive .",
    "note , too , that all the points must also live on the simplex , so @xmath39    how many inequalities are relevant ?",
    "let us represent the above matrix in the following tableau : @xmath40 \\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}&&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt } } & 1$\\vphantom{0^{0 ^ 0}}$&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt } } & 2&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt } } & 3&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}\\\\ \\hline & 1&&$a$&&$d$&&$e$&\\\\ \\hline & 2&&$d$&&$b$&&$f$&\\\\ \\hline & 3&&$e$&&$f$&&$c$&\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] where the row and column numbers will be used later to define @xmath41 inequalities .",
    "there are @xmath42 or nine possible combinations of four cells  that is , nine inequalities .",
    "however , by symmetry , three are simply duplicates of others .",
    "the following tableau represents all of the inequalities : @xmath43 \\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}&&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt } } & $ ( 1,2)$$\\vphantom{0^{0 ^ 0}}$&\\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}&$(1,3)$ & \\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}&$(2,3)$ & \\multirow{4}{0.5pt}[4.8pt]{\\rule{0.5pt}{58pt}}\\\\ \\hline & $ ( 1,2)$&&$\\mathbf{ab}\\ge \\mathbf{d}^2$&&$af\\ge de$&&$df\\ge be$&\\\\ \\hline & $ ( 1,3)$&&$af\\ge de$&&$ac\\ge e^2$&&$dc\\ge ef$&\\\\ \\hline & $ ( 2,3)$&&$\\mathbf{df}\\ge \\mathbf{be}$&&$dc\\ge ef$&&$\\mathbf{bc}\\ge \\mathbf{f}^2$&\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 means form a matrix with elements from rows @xmath35 and @xmath36 and columns @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the first tableau . observe that when the three inequalities highlighted in bold are satisfied , all others will be also satisfied .",
    "in fact , the inequality @xmath47 derives from @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "finally , inequality @xmath50 derives from the other two , previously established ",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "all other inequalities can be obtained from the adjacent ones in this fashion .",
    "adding values to the type spaces of bidders expands the number of determinental restrictions required to satisfy @xmath18 , thus restricting the space of distributions that can be entertained . likewise , adding bidders to the game , particularly if the bidders are assumed symmetric , also restricts the space of distributions that can be entertained . for example , suppose a third bidder is added , one who is symmetric to the previous two . the probability mass function for triplets of values @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , can be represented as an array whose slices can then be represented by the following three matrices for bidders @xmath56 and @xmath57 , indexed by the values of bidder  @xmath32 : @xmath58 in general , if the number of bidders is @xmath59 and the number of values is @xmath60 , then , without symmetry or affiliation , probability arrays have @xmath61 unique elements .",
    "also , @xcite has shown that symmetry reduces this to @xmath62 elements , while affiliation restricts where these @xmath62 probabilities can live on the simplex via the determinental inequalities required by @xmath18 .",

    "in this three - by - three example , only nine constraints are relevant  viz .",
    ", @xmath63 if these hold , then the remainder are satisfied , too . knowing the maximum number of binding constraints is relevant later in the paper when we discuss our test statistic",

    "similarly , kernel - smoothing requires a choice of bandwidth parameter , too . in sum ,",
    "nonparametric estimation using either grid distributions or smoothed kernels is very similar .",
    "of course , one concern is that @xmath60 appears fixed in our analysis , but @xmath163 is increasing , so our test is potentially inconsistent .",
    "we imagine a sequence of @xmath238 with values increasing as @xmath163 increases , but not as fast as @xmath163 .",
    "below , we discuss in detail what we have in mind .",
    "another worry is that the test statistic will be ill - behaved if @xmath239 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , an upper bound @xmath240 must exist .",
    "this discussion leads us to introduce the following assumption concerning @xmath241 which allows us to side - step these technical problems :    [ ass : grid ] the true data - generating process @xmath241 is a grid distribution , that is , there exists @xmath242 such that @xmath243 .",
    "as the discussion above made clear , this assumption is similar to the assumptions of smoothness concerning @xmath241 which kernel - smoothing methods require .",
    "in addition to this analogy , we offer two additional justifications for assumption [ ass : grid ] .",
    "first , the set of grid distributions is dense in the set of all distributions : even if the data - generating process ( dgp ) @xmath241 were not a grid distribution , there is a grid distribution that is arbitrarily close to it . to wit",
    ", no finite amount of data could reject assumption [ ass : grid ] . in this sense , assumption [ ass : grid ] is almost `` no assumption . ''",
    "second , the dgp in question is a distribution of values , which are discrete ( up to , say , dollars or cents or yen or won or whatever units one wants ) .",
    "when one assumes a smooth probability density function , one is making an approximation , for computational convenience : such an approximation does not seem , to us at least , any more appealing than the one we make . on the contrary , it seems more natural to us to assume simple probability density functions rather than any smoothness conditions . in general , smoothness is just a tool used to lighten the burden in the technical analysis of a particular problem . in our case , by assuming that the distribution is simple ( i.e. , a grid distribution ) , we can stay closer to reality .    under assumption",
    "[ ass : grid ] , our test is consistent , for assumption [",
    "ass : grid ] implies that a @xmath60 exists such that @xmath244 .",
    "therefore , the number of inequalities required for affiliation remains fixed .",
    "we are then in the standard framework considered by wolak , which has a fixed set of inequalities .",
    "thus , consistency follows directly from wolak s research .",
    "a technically sophisticated reader may feel that our consistency result is trivial , once assumption [ ass : grid ] is made .",
    "the point of this paper ( and this subsection , in particular ) is not to provide a technical proof of consistency , but rather to remove any doubts concerning the consistency of our test under a reasonable assumption .    for any specific implementation , @xmath60 is assumed fixed in the approximation . in the asymptotics ,",
    "we imagine @xmath239 increasing as @xmath163 increases , until some upper bound @xmath245 is reached . in any application , however , if @xmath163 is quite large , not what we encounter in our application , then one can vary @xmath60 , which will potentially yield different estimates .",
    "the power of the proposed test clearly depends on the choice of @xmath60 .",
    "were @xmath60 chosen to be one ( i.e. , a uniform distribution on the @xmath59-dimensional hypercube ) , then affiliation would never be rejected .",
    "on the other hand , given a finite sample of @xmath163 observations , a large @xmath60 will result in many cells having no elements . while the choice of @xmath60 is obviously important and certainly warrants additional theoretical investigation , perhaps along the lines of research in time - series analysis by @xcite concerning optimal adaptive detection of correlation functions , it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in fact , in most applications to auctions , where samples are often quite small , @xmath60 will be dictated by practical considerations  viz . , the relative size of @xmath163 .      for our test statistic to be well - behaved , it is important to know that an upper bounds exists on the number of inequalities . for arbitrary @xmath59 and @xmath60 , assuming a symmetric distribution , we can construct a bound on how many inequalities there are . because we focus on symmetric distributions , @xmath246(i_1,i_2,\\ldots , i_n)= [ f^0_{{\\mathbf{v}}}](i_1^\\prime , i_2^\\prime,\\ldots , i_n^\\prime),\\ ] ] where @xmath247 is a permutation of @xmath131 .",
    "thus , we need only consider sorted indices , indices @xmath131 for which @xmath248 .",
    "consider @xmath131 , a sorted index having @xmath45 different numbers ; let @xmath249 denote the number of repetitions of the different numbers in @xmath131 .",
    "obviously , @xmath250 . using this notation , the number of permutations of @xmath251 is then @xmath252 .",
    "for instance , the index @xmath253 has @xmath254 or @xmath255 different permutations .",
    "given the above , we can now focus our attention to sorted indices only . consider the lexicographic order of them . in this way",
    ", we can attribute an unambiguous natural number to each sorted index of length @xmath59 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath256 , in which case @xmath257 corresponds to 1 ; @xmath258 , to 2 ; @xmath259 , to 3 ; @xmath260 to 5 ; @xmath261 , to 7 ; and @xmath262 to 11 .",
    "it is important to develop an algorithm to convert a sorted index into a corresponding number , which we describe now .",
    "first , let us define @xmath263 as the number of all indices that areweakly below ( in the lexicographic order ) to the index @xmath264 , that is , the index that has @xmath36 in all positions and has length @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to seethat @xmath265 , because there is just one index weakly below @xmath266 , itself .",
    "also , @xmath267 , because @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath21 are the sorted indices weakly below @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath268 , because @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath269 are the sorted indices weakly below @xmath269 . from this argument , it is not difficult to see that @xmath270 .",
    "observe , too , that @xmath271 , because there are only the indexes @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 weakly below @xmath275 .",
    "@xcite has proven the following :    @xmath276 .",
    "thus , if we fix the number of bidders @xmath59 and the number of intervals @xmath60 , then there are @xmath277 different indices .",
    "affiliation will be satisfied if the corresponding inequality is satisfied for any pair of indices @xmath278 . since there are @xmath279 or @xmath280 pair of such indices , it is sufficient to test @xmath281 inequalities . note , however , that this is an upper bound because some inequalities are implied by others .",
    "the above discussion also provides some guidance concerning how to choose the inequalities ; however , in an effort to conserve space , we leave the discussion of what the minimal set of sufficient inequalities is to another paper .      like us ,",
    "@xcite have examined some important economic implications of affiliation . instead of considering bids , however , li and zhang examined the entry behavior of potential bidders whose signals may be affiliated .",
    "theirs is a parametric analysis and they implemented their test using simulation methods , examining timber sales organized by the department of forestry in the state of oregon .",
    "li and zhang found only a small degree of affiliation , perhaps because the zero / one entry decision is not as informative as bid data .",
    "@xcite have developed a consistent nonparametric test designed for continuous data . by avoiding discretization , jun et  al .",

    "on the other hand , having rejected affiliation with their test , it is unclear what to do within their framework because an alternative hypothesis is unspecified .",
    "in contrast , our approach augments the theoretical work of @xcite where the alternative hypothesis is clearly outlined .",

    "errors can occur only in simple numerical operations such as sums , divisions and square roots .",
    "it turns out that determining the existence of a symmetric mpse is nontrivial when affiliation is absent .",
    "if @xmath282 $ ] has a symmetric mpse , then it can be used to calculate expected revenues under the first- and second - price auctions , denoted @xmath284}$ ] and @xmath285}$ ] , respectively . in this way",
    ", one can determine which auction format yields a higher expected revenue for @xmath282 $ ] and , also , the magnitude of the revenue difference @xmath286}-r^1_{[\\hat { \\mathbf{p}}]})$ ] , to decide whether it is significant .",
    "the procedure can then be repeated using @xmath287 $ ] , which is obtained under the constraint that the distribution satisfies affiliation .",
    "we know that , under affiliation , a  symmetric mpse exists and that @xmath288}- r^1_{[\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}]})\\geq0 $ ] , but the method also allows one to decide whether the magnitudes of the differences @xmath289}-r^1_{[\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}]})$ ] and @xmath286}-r^2_{[\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}]})$ ] are economically important .",
    "it is quite possible that the expected - revenue difference between first- and second - price auctions is nonzero , but small in economic terms , and the method allows one to examine sampling variability by repeating the above procedures using resampled draws from @xmath282 $ ] or @xmath287 $ ] .",
    "thus , if the estimated difference is economically large relative to the sampling error , then this is important information for a policy maker to know .",
    "thus , the grid distributions proposed in this paper have many advantages because a theory exists that can be used for policy analysis .",
    "such theories have not yet been developed for other methods ; if affiliation is rejected under these methods , then what to do ?",
    "above , in section [ s3 ] , in the tradition of the theoretical literature concerning auctions , we developed our model of bidding in terms of valuations for an object to be sold at auction under the first - price , sealed - bid .",
    "sealed - bid tenders are often used in procurement  that is , low - price , sealed - bid auctions at which a buyer ( often a government agency ) seeks to find the lowest - cost producer of some good or service . in this section",
    "we report results from an empirical investigation of procurement tenders for road resurfacing by a government agency .",
    "although it is well known that results from auctions can be translated to procurement , and vice versa , sometimes this translation is tedious .",
    "we direct the interested reader to the work of @xcite who have developed a procedure to translate results from auctions to procurement .",
    "we have applied our empirical framework to data from low - price , sealed - bid , procurement auctions held by the department of transportation ( dot ) in the state of michigan . at these auctions ,",
    "qualified firms are invited to bid on jobs that involve resurfacing roads in michigan .",
    "we have chosen this type of auction because the task at hand is quite well understood .",
    "in addition , there are reasons to believe that firm - specific characteristics make the private - cost paradigm a reasonable assumption ; for example , the reservation wages of owners / managers , who typically are paid the residual , can vary considerably across firms . on the other hand ,",
    "other features suggest that the cost signals of individual bidders could be dependent , perhaps even affiliated ; for example , these firms hire other factor services in the same market and , thus , face the same costs for inputs such as energy as well as paving inputs .",
    "for example , suppose paving at auction @xmath290 has the following leontief production function for bidder @xmath75 : @xmath291 where @xmath292 denotes the managerial labor , while @xmath293 and @xmath294 denote other factor inputs which are priced competitively at @xmath295 and @xmath296 , respectively , at auction @xmath290 .",
    "assume that @xmath297 , bidder @xmath75 s marginal value of time , is an independent , private - cost draw from a common distribution .",
    "in addition , assume that the other factor prices @xmath295 and @xmath296 are draws from another joint distribution , and that they are independent of @xmath297 . the marginal cost per mile @xmath298 at auction @xmath290 can be then written as @xmath299 which is a special case of an affiliated private - cost ( apc ) model , known as a _ conditional private - cost _ model .",
    "the costs in this model are affiliated only when the distribution of @xmath297 is log - concave , which is discussed extensively in @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied this model extensively . in short ,",
    "the affiliated private - cost paradigm ( apcp ) seems a reasonable null hypothesis .",
    "we did not investigate issues relating to asymmetries across bidders because we do not know bidder identities , data necessary to implement such a specification . because no reserve price exists at these auctions ,",
    "we treat the number of participants as if it were the number of potential bidders and focus on auctions at which three bidders participated .",
    "thus , we are ignoring the potential importance of participation costs which others , including @xcite , have investigated elsewhere .",
    "the data for this part of the paper were provided by the michigan dot and were organized and used by @xcite ; a complete description of these data is provided in that paper . in table",
    "[ tab:51 ] we present the summary descriptive statistics concerning our sample of @xmath300 observations@xmath301 auctions that involved three bidders each .",
    "we chose auctions with just three bidders not only to illustrate the general nature of the method ( if we can do three , then we can do @xmath59 ) , but also to reduce the data requirements .",
    "when we subdivide the unit hypercube into @xmath122 cells , the average number of bids in a cell is proportional to @xmath302 .",
    "when @xmath59 is very large , the sample size must be on the order of @xmath122 in order to expect at least one observation in each cell .",
    "this example also illustrates the potential limitations of our approach ; viz .",

    "if these other common - knowledge covariates exist , then we could wrongly conclude that the signals have a strong form of correlation when , in fact , the correctly - specified model of signals ( conditioned on the common - knowledge information ) would have only small correlation .",

    "this information is potentially useful to a policy maker .",
    "the apparent high degree of estimated affiliation also explains why low levels of observed competition are often sufficient to maintain relatively low profit margins : strong affiliation is akin to fierce competition . under strong affiliation",
    ", a potential winner knows that his nearest competitor probably has a valuation ( cost ) close to his , and this disciplines his bidding behavior : he becomes more aggressive than under independence .",
    "our research has other policy implications , too .",
    "as mentioned above , it is well known that , under affiliation , the english auction format , on average , generates more revenue for the seller than the first - price , sealed - bid format . in procurement , under affiliation , an english or a vickrey auction would get the job done more cheaply than the low - price , sealed - bid format . were the english or vickrey formats being used and affiliation not rejected , then the procurement agency would be justified in its choice of mechanism . what remains a bit of a puzzle",
    "is why the low - price , sealed - bid format is used in the presence of such strong affiliation .",
    "perhaps , other features , such as the ability of the low - price , sealed - bid auction format to thwart collusion are important , too . alternatively , perhaps other moments of the bid distribution , such as the variance , are important to the procurement agency .",
    "on the other hand , had affiliation been rejected , then the procedures described in section [ s4 ] could be used to determine which auction format would get the job done most cheaply , on average . again , it is possible that the english or vickrey formats would still be preferred . in any case , the methods described in section [ s4 ] permit a better understanding of the bidding differences , which can aid in choosing the best auction format .",
