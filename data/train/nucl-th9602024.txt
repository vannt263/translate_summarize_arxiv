    "in the realm of pion - nuclear physics , the pion interaction with the deuteron is of special interest@xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", it is the simplest few - body system in which conventional theories ( faddeev theory , coupled @xmath3 equations and multiple scattering theory ) can be rigorously tested .",
    "the knowledge obtained from these studies can then be extended to many - body systems . on the experimental side ,",
    "a large set of measurements for differential cross sections and polarization observables are available in @xmath4 scattering .",
    "thus , there is sufficient motivation to study pion interaction mechanisms with very light nuclei in detail .    in recent years",
    "the three - body approach has been used extensively in describing the pion - deuteron interaction . from the point of view of solving the @xmath5 three - body problem",
    "directly this is clearly an important achievement .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the three - body formalism the application of the obtained results to the case of pion interaction with heavier nuclei may be more difficult .    on the other hand , a microscopic description of the pion - nuclear interaction in the framework of the multiple scattering theory @xcite has continuously been improved .",
    "more recent developments are due especially to techniques developed to perform calculations in momentum space using the kmt@xcite formulation of the multiple scattering theory . in momentum space nonlocalities of the pion - nuclear interaction , off - shell extrapolations of the pion - nucleon scattering amplitudes and exact treatment of fermi motion",
    "can be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the kmt approach is important to avoid double counting of pion rescattering on the same nucleon . with the addition of the phenomenological @xmath6 term  @xcite , which is responsible for real pion absorption and second order effects ,",
    "the momentum space formalism was successful in describing the pion - nuclear interaction in the @xmath7 resonance region as well as at low energies for a large set of nuclei with a=440 . in refs.@xcite",
    ", this method has been extended successfully to the description of pionic atoms as well .",
    "the aim of the present work is a systematic investigation of pion scattering on the deuteron in the region of pion kinetic energies of @xmath8=60300 mev .",
    "we employ a multiple scattering framework in momentum space using only elementary amplitudes extracted from @xmath9 scattering data and realistic deuteron wave functions . due to the latter ingredient we are in a good position to fix the nuclear structure input in order to shed more light on the reaction mechanism .",
    "another purpose is to develop a pion deuteron interaction that can be used for pion photoproduction on the deuteron in a straightforward way .",
    "such an approach , applied to pion scattering and pion photoproduction on the trinucleon  @xcite has provided an excellent description of the differential cross section .",
    "this has motivated us to extend our momentum space approach for these reactions to the deuteron .",
    "our study has been divided into two parts . in this paper",
    "we investigate pion elastic scattering on the deuteron , testing our multiple scattering approach by comparing with all available experimental data .",
    "coherent @xmath10 photoproduction is considered in the second part .",
    "the main aspects of our formalism based on the kmt multiple scattering approach and coupled - channels method are given in section 2 .",

    "the operator @xmath28 projects onto the states of the continuum .",
    "one of the main problems which arise in applying these equations to pion deuteron scattering is the correct description of the coupling to the break - up or continuum channels . in this case",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation has a noncompact kernel and , therefore , can not be solved numerically .",
    "it is well known that the solution to this problem was found by faddeev who from the system of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) derived a new set of equations which do not have this inherent shortcoming .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that multiple scattering theory is able mainly to reproduce existing experimental data using several standard approximations for the solution of the eqs .",
    "this in turn generates a simple pion - deuteron interaction that will be used in our description of coherent @xmath10 photoproduction , discussed in the following part . as a first step ,",
    "we _ neglect the contribution from the coupling to the break - up channel_. this means that in eqs .",
    "( 5b-5c ) the contribution from the @xmath28-operator is dropped .",
    "the motivation for this approximation is that contributions from the diagonal matrix elements dominate due to the large overlap of the nuclear wave functions in the initial and final states . as we will see below this approximation",
    "is a resonable starting point for the study of pion - nuclear interaction .",
    "however , at low energies where for isoscalar nuclei the contribution from the @xmath29 operator is very small , the coupling to the break - up channels becomes important .",

    "we begin our discussion with some of the main features of the pion - nuclear interaction . the results of our calculations for pion kinetic energies in the lab system , @xmath8= 65 , 181 and 254 mev ,",
    "are shown in fig . 1",
    ". one of the most important properties of the @xmath9 interaction in this energy region is the dominance of the @xmath150-wave contribution coming from the @xmath7-isobar excitation .",
    "this feature is reflected in the coherent scattering process which is proportional to @xmath151 ( nuclear mass number ) and described by the scalar - isoscalar part ( @xmath152 ) of the @xmath9 amplitude .",
    "since the @xmath150-wave part of this amplitude has a @xmath153 dependence , the differential cross section experiences a minimum around @xmath154 ( see dashed curves ) .",
    "the position of this minimum is slightly shifted from the lorentz transformation of the pion angle from the @xmath9 to the @xmath4 c.m .",
    "frame and from the @xmath155- and @xmath150-wave interference .",
    "the spin - flip transition coming from the amplitude @xmath156 ( which is also mainly of @xmath150-wave nature ) , is proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "the corresponding spin - flip contribution fills in the minimum , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "in the @xmath7-resonance region ( @xmath8=180 mev ) our results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data and are basically the same as the results of three - body faddeev calculations  @xcite",
    ". this may be due to the dominance of the @xmath7-resonance contribution .",
    "it had been shown in ref.@xcite that in this case the two - body approach is a good approximation for the more elaborate three - body faddeev framework .",
    "however , at lower energies ( @xmath158 mev ) our model fails to reproduce the experimental data in the forward direction .",
    "this is related to the well - known problem of describing the low - energy @xmath115-wave pion - nucleon interaction in nuclei with zero isospin . in this case , the contribution from the large isovector @xmath9 scattering amplitude @xmath159 cancels and only the small @xmath144 amplitude remains in the first - order potential .",
    "therefore , in the zero - energy limit our approach gives a small value for the @xmath4-scattering length @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the @xmath115-wave @xmath4 scattering phase shift calculated with the first - order potential .",
    "the experimental value is about five times larger : @xmath162  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation one expects higher - order effects in the pion - nuclear interaction to be important . the well - known result",
    "( see for example refs.@xcite ) for the second - order correction is @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in this expression",
    "the contribution from the isovector amplitude @xmath159 which describes double isovector scattering ( including charge exchange ) becomes important .",
    "taking into account such a correction for the scattering length we obtain @xmath166 which is in better agreement with the experimental value as well as with results from faddeev calculations : @xmath167 @xcite ( for the same set of @xmath144 and @xmath159 amplitudes ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , this correction factor also improves the agreement with the experimental data for the differential cross section at @xmath8=65 mev ( see dash - dotted curve ) .    the role of the @xmath168-configuration in the deuteron wave function",
    "is also illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "its contribution can be seen by turning off the nuclear matrix elements of eq .",
    "( 26 ) with @xmath169 ( see dotted curves in fig .",
    "1 ) , thus retaining the normalization condition of eq .",
    "( 28 ) . as expected , the @xmath116-state contribution becomes significant at large angles , @xmath170 , for pion energies @xmath171180 mev which correspond to momentum transfers of @xmath172 .",
    "2 presents our results for higher pion energies .",
    "note that with increasing pion energies the second - order correction discussed above becomes less important due to the dominance of the pion - nucleon @xmath150-wave contribution .",
    "however , it is still visible at @xmath8=142 mev and it improves the description in the forward direction ( the corresponding result is not shown in fig .",
    "2 ) . fig .",
    "2 illustrates the role of pion rescattering contributions coming from the second term of eq .",
    "( 8) by comparing the plane wave ( without second term of eq .",
    "( 8) ) calculations ( dashed curves ) with the full results ( solid curves ) .",
    "pion rescattering becomes very important in the @xmath7-region ( @xmath173 mev ) , especially at large angles .",
    "here it can reduce the plane wave results by a factor of two .",
    "however , with further increase of energy the @xmath9-interaction becomes weaker again , and , consequently , the rescattering contributions become smaller .    at @xmath0",
    "mev the main problem which arises in our approach ( as well as faddeev calculations ) is the discrepancy with experimental data at backward angles .",
    "in contrast to faddeev results which usually overestimate the data in this region by a factor of two  @xcite , our calculations tend to underestimate the measurements .",
    "we point out that a similar disagreement has been found for pion scattering on @xmath1he and @xmath2he  @xcite .    in the framework of faddeev equations",
    "there have been numerous attempts to improve the situation at backward angles , mainly by changing the two - body inputs .",
    "one of the more controversial attempts addressed the @xmath174 part of the @xmath9 amplitude with its division into a pole and nonpole term , summarized in refs.@xcite .",
    "we only note here that the pole term determines the coupling between the @xmath175 and @xmath5 channels . due to this coupling , pion scattering",
    "can also be presented as pion absorption on one nucleon and subsequent emission from another .",
    "such a two - body mechanism is not included in the standard multiple scattering theory . at large momentum transfers",
    "this process could be important because of the possibility of momentum sharing .",
    "however , as argued by jennings  @xcite , such a two - body mechanism is almost completely canceled by additional contributions which come from the time ordering of the pion absorption and emission processes .    on the other hand , the issue concerning the so - called @xmath174-problem can not be regarded as settled since the strong cancellation takes place only if there is no interaction between the two nucleons in the intermediate state .",
    "our simple estimates show that if we would include the repulsive part of the @xmath175-interaction which involves heavy meson exchange ( as was done by mizutani and koltun in their study of the @xmath4 scattering length  @xcite ) , the cancellation disappears .",
    "after a modification of the free two - nucleon propagator by adding the mean value of the residual @xmath175-interaction @xmath176 the corresponding two - body contribution becomes proportional to @xmath177 .",
    "2 illustrates the effects which could come from this two - body mechanism with @xmath178 mev .",
    "clearly , a more microscopic calculation is called for , here we want to merely point out that this mechanism can improve the situation at backward angles .      here",
    "we begin our discussion with the results for the tensor analyzing powers . in order to understand the general structure of these observables and their behavior in different kinematical regions we first consider the size of the observables at backward angles @xmath179 .",
    "it is instructive to also neglect the contribution of the deuteron @xmath168-component . as an example , fig .",
    "3 presents @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 at @xmath183 mev .",
    "we remind the reader that , according to eq .",
    "( 19 ) , the last two observables are linear combinations of @xmath180 , @xmath184 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 30 ) that at @xmath179 the amplitudes @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 vanish .",
    "therefore , at backward angles the observables @xmath184 and @xmath92 vanish as well , and @xmath180 reduces to the following expression @xmath188 from eq .",
    "( 30 ) we can see that in the region where the radial integral @xmath189 , the contribution from the @xmath190 amplitude becomes very small . in this region",
    "we then have @xmath191 this result is confirmed experimentally for @xmath192 mev .",
    "note , that at lower energies in the region where the deuteron @xmath116-wave contribution is small ( @xmath193 ) tensor observables at backward angles become proportional to the strength of the deuteron @xmath116-state .",
    "for example , @xmath194 .",
    "another simplified scenario is given by neglecting the pion rescattering contributions and the deuteron @xmath116-wave .",
    "in this case , the @xmath186-amplitude vanishes , and @xmath195 and @xmath196 . due to these identities , @xmath197 and the other observables",
    "can be expressed solely via the elementary @xmath9 scattering amplitudes @xmath198 as we have shown in the analysis of the differential cross sections , due to the dominance of the @xmath150-wave contribution in @xmath9 scattering , @xmath199 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath200 region where the contribution from the deuteron @xmath115-state dominates we have @xmath201 fig .",
    "3 shows that these predictions can already reproduce the experimental measurements fairly well .",
    "the next three figures , fig .",
    "4 , fig . 5 and fig . 6 ,",
    "present tensor observables at @xmath8=134 , 180 , 219 and 256 mev .",
    "in general , their behavior follows the simple picture described above . at backward angles @xmath180 and @xmath92",
    "are almost completely given by the @xmath168-component of the deuteron wave function .",
    "in forward direction ( up to @xmath202 ) the main contribution comes from the @xmath203-component . here",
    "@xmath180 and @xmath92 contain very little nuclear structure information .",
    "@xmath184 depends entirely on the deuteron @xmath116-state . in the case of the @xmath181-observable , which is mainly associated with @xmath184 ,",
    "the deuteron @xmath115-state tends to fill in the minimum around @xmath200 .",
    "note that this minimum appears because of the p - wave dominance of the @xmath9 scattering amplitude .",
    "finally , we see that the influence of pion rescattering effects on all tensor analyzing powers is small .",
    "thus , we can obtain a good description for the tensor observables .",
    "this may be related to the fact that they are determined mainly by the absolute values of the @xmath204 amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , the vector analyzing power @xmath90 depends on the interference between these amplitudes .",
    "therefore , we expect this quantity to be more sensitive to details of the model ingredients . in fig .",
    "7 we compare our results with some old  @xcite and more recent  @xcite measurements .",
    "we obtain satisfactory agreement with these data only at @xmath8=100 mev . at all other energies",
    "our results fail to reproduce the experimental data , especially for @xmath170 .",
    "the failure becomes more dramatic with increasing pion energy . in",
    "our full calculation @xmath90 goes through zero around @xmath8=180 mev and becomes negative at @xmath170 .",
    "we have found that pion rescattering is mainly responsible for this effect .",
    "experimental measurements show quite the opposite behavior : above @xmath8=250 mev , @xmath90 changes the sign in forward direction producing a negative dip around @xmath205 and it assumes large positive values for @xmath170 .",
    "this behavior could only be described in simple calculations without pion rescattering ( dashed curves ) .",
    "note that the influence of the deuteron @xmath116-state on @xmath90 is small .",
    "therefore , in the plane wave approximation the vector analyzing power can be expressed via the elementary @xmath9 scattering amplitudes @xmath206    in this paper we have not attempted to present a detailed comparison with the faddeev calculations that have been performed .",
    "a review of these results can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we only mention that all conventional calculations encounter the difficulties in the description of the measured vector analyzing power in the @xmath7-resonance region .    on a phenomenological level",
    "we have studied the effect of modifying the spin - flip amplitude @xmath145 ( similar to @xmath144 at low energies ) @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the deuteron ground state .",

    "the sensitivity of the differential cross section and tensor analyzing powers to this correction is small since they are dominated by the coherent contribution from the non - spin flip amplitude @xmath144 .",
    "however , it has a dramatic influence on the vector analyzing power . using this sensitivity we extracted the @xmath209 parameter from the experimental data for @xmath90 .",
    "the result of our fit is shown in fig .",
    "7 by the dash - dotted curves .",
    "it is remarkable that the energy behavior of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath209 follows a typical resonance structure ( see fig .",
    "8) . this might be an indication for the presence of a residual @xmath210 interaction .",
    "we point out that a similar situation occurs in pion scattering on @xmath1he for the target asymmetry @xmath211  @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the origin of this phenomenon is similar for both reactions .",
    "it therefore becomes very important to find a consistent description of polarization observables in pion scattering on the deuteron and @xmath1he .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the interaction of pions with the deuteron in a multiple scattering approach carried out in momentum space .",
    "our investigation covered the energy region of @xmath8= 60 - 300 mev , thus covering both the low - energy and the @xmath7 region .",
    "paris wave functions were employed to describe the deuteron .",
    "phase - shift parameterizations were used for the elementary @xmath9 amplitudes , along with a separable potential for the off - shell extrapolation .",
    "the full spin and isospin dependence of the @xmath9 amplitudes were taken into account .",
    "our framework of multiple scattering theory is clearly less sophisticated than the many faddeev calculations that have studied pion deuteron scattering over the years .",
    "the primary purpose of our investigation was to demonstrate that the approach developed recently for the description of the pion interaction with @xmath212 nuclei can be reliably applied in the case of the deuteron .",
    "the results obtained are transparent and can in the following be employed for the study of pion photo- and electroproduction off deuterium .",
    "we found that our approach gives a good description of the differential cross sections and the tensor analyzing powers . at low pion energies , second - order corrections",
    "must be included , while at higher energies and backward angles discrepancies appear that may be related to two - body processes involving heavy meson exchange .",
    "the tensor analyzing powers strongly depend on the deuteron @xmath116-state and can be reproduced satisfactorily .",
    "clearly , the outstanding problem is the explanation of the well - measured vector analyzing power which has defied a number of attempts using more advanced approaches than ours . while there may be a sensitivity regarding a residual @xmath210-interaction care has to be taken to include it consistently .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "e. boschitz for helpful discussions and providing us with the new data for the polarization observables .",
    "one of us ( s.s.k ) is grateful to the theory group of prof .",
