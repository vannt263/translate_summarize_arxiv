    "precision physics at future linear collider experiments including standard model measurements and searches for new physics beyond the standard model requires unprecedented reconstruction capabilities of di - jet and multi - jet final states .",
    "the desired jet energy resolution @xmath2 can be achieved by particle flow algorithms , which will in turn require highly granular calorimetry with all read - out electronics fully integrated into the detector volume  @xcite .",
    "one option of highly granular hadron calorimeters developed within the calice collaboration uses small and thin plastic scintillator tiles individually read out by silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) @xcite .",
    "as high granularity will lead to a large number of channels , the implementation of around ten millions scintillator tiles and sipms in the final hadron calorimeter is challenging and can only be feasible via automated mass assembly .",
    "surface - mounted sipms ( smd - sipms ) are an ideal candidate for this goal since they are more tolerant in mechanical positioning than sipms with pins ( tht - sipms , where tht stands for through - hole technology ) .",
    "we have also observed that part of a scintillator tile was melted during machine soldering of a tht - sipm which was beforehand glued into the side surface of the tile  @xcite , which also makes the mass assembly of tht - sipms more challenging .",
    "but directly coupling an smd - sipm to an intact scintillator tile does not result in an adequately uniform spatial response .",
    "there have been efforts of shaping a cavity in a scintillator tile to improve the response uniformity @xcite .",
    "we have studied further on how the geometry and surface properties of a cavity influences light collection and developed a dedicated cavity design for a given sipm package based on the geant4 full simulation . in our design",
    ", an smd - sipm can be directly soldered onto a readout printed circuit board ( pcb ) and fully placed inside a cavity .",
    "therefore , all sipms can be soldered in the same way as other standard smd - components for the pcb .",
    "after the mass soldering process , tiles can then be directly placed on top of sipms individually , which would be feasible via automated mass assembly .",
    "such a design aims to achieve both high response to incident particles and good spatial response uniformity .",
    "herein we first present simulation results of an optimized cavity design , followed by cosmic - ray measurements for the response of a scintillator tile using the same cavity design to minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) .",
    "finally response uniformity measurements for the cavity design using a radioactive source to scan the whole tile area are summarized .",
    "in order to study and optimize the cavity design , a geant4-based full simulation model has been built , including all related physics process , such as scintillation , transportation and optical boundary processes .",
    "detailed geometry descriptions of a scintillator tile with a cavity and a sipm package have been implemented .",
    "the emission spectrum of a chosen scintillator ( bc408 ) as well as the photon detection efficiency ( pde ) of a sipm candidate ( hamamatsu mppc s12571 - 025p ) at different photon wavelengths are interpolated based on data sheets respectively .",
    "the wavelength - dependent reflectivity of two types of 3 m reflective foil ( esr and df2000ma ) wrapped around the tile is also taken into account , based on two independent measurements  @xcite .",
    "the size of each tile is @xmath3 , as required by the aforementioned high granularity . in the simulation , placing a cavity in the center of the tile surface shows better response uniformity than along a side or in a corner . among several different shapes ,",
    "a dome - shaped cavity is chosen , which shows promising response uniformity and simplifies shaping of the cavity via mechanical drilling and polishing .",
    "different geometry parameters of the dome ( i.e. dome height and dome diameter on the bottom surface ) and surface properties for both the tile and the cavity ( i.e. polished or ground ) have been varied in the simulation , which turns out that polished surfaces of the tile and the cavity can improve response uniformity .",
    "geometry parameters of the dome have been chosen as shown in fig .",

    "we have constructed in mainz a customized cosmic - ray test setup for measuring responses of scintillator tiles to muons , which are ideal candidates of mips .",
    "one of tiles under test is placed between two trigger scintillators coupled to two pmts by light guides .",
    "the coincidence of two trigger signals ensures a muon track passing though the tile and also constrains the incident angle of each muon .",
    "the smd - sipm module mppc s12571 - 025p has a sensitive area of @xmath6 with @xmath7 pixel pitch .",
    "one such smd - sipm is soldered onto a readout pcb and a scintillator tile is fixed on top of the pcb . with the optimized cavity design , this sipm detected 23.2 p.e . on average to a muon , as shown in fig .",
