    "however , there are strong indications from both the gas kinematics and distribution that a significant fraction of the co(1 - 0 ) emission is spread across tens of kpc .    first , despite the limited spatial resolution of our observations",
    ", there appears to be a velocity gradient in the gas kinematics across the inner 30 - 40 kpc of the spiderweb .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : map ] , the redshift of the co(1 - 0 ) peak emission decreases when going from region ` a ' to region ` b ' to region ` c ' .",
    "most prominent is the apparent spatial separation between the peak of the blue component of the double - peaked co(1 - 0 ) profile in region c and the peak of the red component in region b. fig.[fig : chanmaps ] visualises that also between regions b and a there is a clear velocity gradient in the co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "the decrease in the velocity of the co(1 - 0 ) peak emission from region a @xmath42 b @xmath42 c is consistent with a decrease in redshift of optical line emitting galaxies found in these regions ( see fig.[fig : map ] , though note that the large atca beam prevents us from spatially resolving the individual galaxies in our co data ) .",
    "fig.[fig : map ] also shows indications for an extension ( ` tail ' ) of the co(1 - 0 ) emission beyond region a ( stretching up to 100 kpc ne of the radio core ) , but this tail is detected only at a 3@xmath39 level and thus needs to be verified .",
    "we have started an observational program to verify the distribution and kinematics of the co(1 - 0 ) emission at higher sensitivity and spatial resolution ( results will be reported in a future paper ) .",
    "in addition , the double - peaked co(1 - 0 ) profile spreads over 1700 km  s@xmath6  ( fwzi ) .",

    "a few notable exceptions are high-@xmath7 systems in which the broad co profiles arise from merging galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as can be seen in fig.1 _ ( bottom right ) _ , the double - peaked co profile resembles the velocity distribution of optical line emitters detected in the spiderweb proto - cluster @xcite , be it with a lower velocity dispersion of the co gas , in particular on the blue - shifted side .",
    "these results thus indicate that a significant fraction of the co(1 - 0 ) detected in the spiderweb galaxy likely originates from ( merging ) satellites of the central radio galaxy , or the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) between them .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,<,<,<,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath43 values are quoted for a single gaussian profile fit , with errors reflecting uncertainties due to assymmetry of the corresponding profile component .",
    "+ @xmath44 regions a and b are spatially unresolved and only marginally resolved kinematically , hence a single value is derived from the entire ` red ' part of the total intensity image of fig.[fig : map ] .",
    "our results also suggests that the redshift of the central radio galaxy is associated with the red peak of the co(1 - 0 ) profile , giving @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite discuss that determining the redshift from optical and uv rest - frame emission lines is bound to a much larger uncertainty , but they derive @xmath46 , which is in agreement with our estimated @xmath47 .",
    "fig.[fig : hae229 ] shows that also the dusty star - forming galaxy hae 229 ( m@xmath9@xmath105@xmath1110@xmath48m@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is detected in co(1 - 0 ) at 3.7@xmath39 significance .",
    "we derive @xmath49 for hae229 .",
    "table [ tab : table ] summarises the co(1 - 0 ) properties .",
    "hae229 is located 250 kpc ( 30  ) west of mrc1138 - 262 , i.e. outside the gaint ly@xmath14  halo .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) signal peaks at @xmath50 km  s@xmath6 , which agrees with the h@xmath14 redshift from @xcite .",
    "none of the other line - emitting galaxies outside the ly@xmath14  halo , but within the field - of - view of our observations , is reliably detected in co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "we can estimate the mass of molecular gas by adopting a standard conversion factor @xmath51 [ m@xmath2 ( k km  s@xmath6  pc@xmath52)@xmath6 ] ( where m@xmath3 includes a helium fraction ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with @xmath54 found in ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( @xmath55 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we stress that the conversion from @xmath36 into m@xmath3 is not yet well understood @xcite and that @xmath54 crucially depends on the properties of the gas , such as metallicity and radiation field @xcite . adopting @xmath56 m@xmath2 ( k km  s@xmath6  pc@xmath52)@xmath6 results in an estimated molecular gas mass in the spiderweb galaxy of m@xmath57 m@xmath2 .",
    "we argue that this is likely a conservative estimate , based on the adopted conversion factor and the fact that a large amount of shock - heated molecular gas resides in the warm ( t@xmath13100k ) phase ( see * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : results ] we saw that , while the co(1 - 0 ) distribution is concentrated on the central radio galaxy , the co emission spreads across the inner 30 - 40 kpc ( a region which is rich in satellite galaxies ) . based on its distribution and kinematics",
    ", we argued that part of the molecular gas is thus most likely associated with these satellite galaxies or the igm between them .",
    "the extreme fwzi of the co(1 - 0 ) emission ( sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) is another indication that the double - peaked profile is not likely caused by a nuclear disc in the central radio galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with earlier speculation by @xcite that the high star formation rates could be the result of the accretion of gas or gas - rich satellites ( which were found by @xcite to contain most of the dust - uncorrected , instantaneous star formation ) , while nuclear star formation may be quenched by jet - induced heating of the molecular gas .",
    "the tentative ne tail ( see fig.[fig : map ] ) spreads further out , beyond region a ( which is rich in satellite galaxies ) into a region with no known companion galaxies or detectable ly@xmath14  emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hae229 ] ) .",
    "however , a mpc - scale filamentary structure exists in east - west direction @xcite .",
    "we speculate that  if confirmed  this tentative tail might indicate that cold gas is found , or being accreted along , this filament .",
    "two alternative scenarios that should be considered to explain the co characteristics are agn driven outflows and cooling flows .",
    "cooling flows have been detected in co in giant central cluster ( cd ) galaxies at @xmath7@xmath590.4 , some of which contain h@xmath18 masses similar to that of the spiderweb galaxy .",
    "however , compared to the spiderweb galaxy , these cooling flow galaxies show much narrower typical line widths ( fwhm@xmath60 km  s@xmath6 , taking into account an uncertain @xmath54 and the use of narrow - band receivers ; @xcite ) . radio - jet driven outflows of optical emission - line gas",
    "were found on scales of tens of kpc in the spiderweb galaxy by @xcite .",
    "similar to the co distribution , these optical emission lines are significantly more redshifted nw compared to se of the radio core , though the ambiguity in optical redshifts makes a direct comparison difficult .",
    "still , there is an interesting alignment between the redshifted co(1 - 0 ) emission in region a and the region in which @xcite detect the fastest redshifted outflow velocities in the optical emission - line gas ( their ` zone 1 ' , which stretches in between region a and b ) .",
    "the fwhm of the optical emission - line gas is , however , significantly larger than that of the co(1 - 0 ) emission , indicating that it has a much larger velocity dispersion .",
    "both the cooling flow and the radio - jet feedback scenario deserve further investigation , once co observations with higher resolution and sensitvity have confirmed the extent of the co(1 - 0 ) emission .          from fitting the mid-",
    "to far - ir spectral energy distribution , @xcite derive a starburst ir - luminosity of l@xmath61l@xmath2 and star formation rate of sfr=1390 m@xmath2yr@xmath6 for mrc1138 - 262 .",
    "l@xmath62/l@xmath63 agrees well with correlations found in various types of low- and high-@xmath7 objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that all the h@xmath18 is available to sustain the high sfr , we derive a minimum mass depletion time - scale of t@xmath64 myr .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated typical lifetime of a major starburst episode in ir - luminous merger systems @xcite , though the bulk of the intense star formation in the spiderweb galaxy may occur on scales of tens of kpc ( sect .",
    "[ sec : nature ] ) .",
    "the mass depletion time - scale may be shorter if the cold molecular gas is more rapidly depleted by feedback processes , such as shock - heating @xcite or jet - induced outflows ( found to occur at rates of @xmath10400m@xmath2yr@xmath6 in the optical emission line gas by @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , both the current large star formation rate and cold molecular gas content imply that we are witnessing a phase of rapid galaxy growth though massive star formation , coinciding with the agn activity .",
    "the h@xmath18 mass is much larger than the estimated mass of the emission - line gas in the ly@xmath14  halo ( m@xmath65m@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite show that the radio source is enveloped by a region of hot , shocked x - ray gas of potentially m@xmath66m@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that , even when the current reservoir of cold molecular gas is consumed , there is a potential gas reservoir available for future episodes of starburst ( and agn ) activity , provided that the gas can cool down to form molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this process is not entirely counter - acted by ongoing agn feedback @xcite .",
    "the merger of proto - cluster galaxies with the spiderweb galaxy may also trigger a new burst of star formation , depending on the available gas reservoir in these systems .",
    "for the dusty star - forming galaxy hae229 , @xmath67 is comparable to that of ir - selected massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath7=1.5 @xcite and some high-@xmath7 submm galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our co results are consistent with observations by @xcite that hae229 is going through a major and heavily obscured starburst episode . from their calculated sfr@xmath10880m@xmath2yr@xmath6 , we derive t@xmath68 myr , i.e. similar to that of the spiderweb galaxy .",
