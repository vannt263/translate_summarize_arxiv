    "the electron - phonon ( @xmath5-ph ) scattering time , @xmath0 , is one of the most important physical quantities in metals and superconductors .",
    "for instance , it determines the dephasing ( also called the phase - breaking or decoherence ) time for the electron wave function , the cooling time for an electron gas , and the relaxation time for the order parameter in a superconductor .",
    "the @xmath5-ph scattering time also plays a crucial role in the development of novel mesoscopic devices such as sensitive low - temperature bolometers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-ph scattering time in the presence of multiple ( elastic ) impurity scattering has been intensively calculated by several authors @xcite , but the current understanding of the temperature and electron elastic mean free path , @xmath4 , dependences of @xmath0 is still incomplete . in particular ,",
    "different temperature and disorder dependences of @xmath0 have been reported , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed that , in addition to the dependence on the total level of disorder , the @xmath6 and @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 might be fairly sensitive to the microscopic quality of the disorder @xcite .",
    "it has also been conjectured that the contribution due to the umklapp process of impurity scattering may be important @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have fabricated two series of pd@xmath1ag@xmath2 thick films by dc - sputtering and rf - sputtering deposition techniques .",
    "the palladium - silver alloys are chosen because pd and ag form perfect fcc solid solution through the alloy series @xcite .",
    "also , since the masses of the pd and ag atoms are quite similar , the vibrational spectrum of the lattice does not change significantly through the alloy series @xcite .",
    "the low - field magnetoresistances of our films are measured at liquid - helium temperatures , and are compared with the weak - localization theoretical predictions to extract the values of the @xmath5-ph scattering time .",
    "our results for the temperature and electron mean free path dependence of @xmath0 and their implications are described below .",
    "our films were prepared from a 99.995% pure pd@xmath1ag@xmath2 ( hereafter refereed to as pdag ) target .",
    "two series of thick films were fabricated , one by dc - sputtering and the other by rf - sputtering deposition technique .",
    "the films were deposited onto glass substrates held at room temperature . in both cases ,",
    "a background pressure of @xmath7 torr was reached before an argon atmosphere of @xmath8 torr was introduced to initiate the deposition process .",
    "a same sputtering gun was used for these two deposition methods , but with the gun being connected to either a dc or a rf power supply .",
    "the distance between the sputtering target and the glass substrates was the same for both methods .",
    "the sputtering power was progressively adjusted to  tune \" the deposition rate , which resulted in different amounts of disorder , i.e. , the residual resistivities @xmath9 [ = @xmath10(10k ) ] , in the films . for the dc - sputtering ( rf - sputtering ) case ,",
    "the deposition rate was varied from 30 to 230 ( 19 to 333 ) @xmath11/min , and values of @xmath12 ranging from 281 to 183 ( 74 to 178 ) @xmath13 cm were obtained .",
    "the sample structures of our films were carefully studied by performing the powder diffraction on an mac mxp18 x - ray diffractometer .",
    "the x - ray power was 10 kw and the scanning speed was 6 degrees per minute .",
    "in all cases , we found our samples to reveal very similar diffraction patterns , which clearly suggested that both the dc and rf sputtered films possessed the same fcc lattice structure characteristic to that of the pdag alloys .",

    "this thickness ensured that the weak - localization effects were three - dimensional in our samples .",
    "it also ensured that the thermal phonons were unambiguously three - dimensional , i.e. , the wavelength of the most probable thermal phonons was always smaller than the film thickness at our measurement temperatures .",
