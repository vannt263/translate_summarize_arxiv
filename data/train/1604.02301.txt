    "charged colloidal particles such as proteins @xcite , surfactant micelles and vesicles @xcite , and nanoparticles @xcite are seldom describable as possessing a fixed charge or a fixed potential , though this notion does not cease to be popular  @xcite .",
    "a more realistic point of view considers colloidal particles immersed in an aqueous electrolyte solution as possessing ionizable surface groups that respond to the local solution conditions  @xcite . formally this perspective is equivalent to the assumption , that one can characterize the chargeable surface of the colloid particles with a specific free energy describing the dissociation / association equilibrium of surface ionizable groups or adsorption / desorption equilibrium of charged ions from solution to the surface @xcite , and is referred to as _ charge regulation _ ( cr ) .",
    "the first formalization of charge regulation was proposed in a seminal work by ninham and parsegian in the 1970 s  @xcite and formulated within the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory of electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "the implementation detais of the cr paradigm can vary .",
    "chemical dissociation equilibrium of surface binding sites with the corresponding law of mass action was introduced already in  @xcite and was later generalizaed in different contexts  @xcite . a surface - site partition function or indeed a surface free energy model leads to the same basic self - consistent boundary conditions for surface dissociation equilibrium , but without an explicit connection with the law of mass action @xcite .",
    "the relationship between various boundary conditions that can be derived was elucidated recently @xcite .",
    "charge regulation has been invoked and widely applied in the context of various colloidal systems : stability and inter - surface forces due to the electrostatic double - layers @xcite , dissociation of amino acids and the corresponding electrostatic protein - protein interactions  @xcite , charge regulation of protein aggregates and viral shells @xcite , and of polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolyte brushes  @xcite , as well as charge regulation of charged lipid membranes  @xcite . here ,",
    "we specifically dedicate ourselves to the problem of the connection between charge regulation and electrostatic interactions between proteins in ionic solutions @xcite .",
    "we recently showed how the kirkwood - schumaker ( ks ) interaction @xcite follows directly from charge regulation , based on different surface free energy models  @xcite , and presented a theory of fluctuation interaction between macroions subject to charge regulation , thereby generalizing the ks perturbation approach @xcite .",
    "we formulated this generalized ks problem by decoupling the system composed of two charge - regulated macroions and an intervening bathing ionic solution into two parts : the solution part and the surface part  @xcite .",
    "these were then treated within separate approximation schemes .",
    "the solution part was treated on the linearized weak - coupling debye - h \" uckel ( dh ) level @xcite , while the surface part was shown to be amenable to an exact evaluation .",
    "this decomposition allowed us to derive a closed - form expression for the total effective interaction between macroions that we were able to connect with the original ks expression .",
    "in fact , our generalized fluctuation - mediated interaction reduces exactly to the ks result in the limit of large separations between macroioins and in fact presents a one - loop ( gaussian fluctuation ) correction to the mean - field dh result . as such",
    ", it is only valid for a weakly charged system , where the salt ions mediating the mean - field as well as fluctuation interactions are electrostatically weakly coupled to the macroions .",
    "no such approximations were necessary in a 1d model that can be evaluated exactly @xcite and supports the conclusions based on the weak coupling ( wc ) approximation .",
    "we now change the perspective and consider a case where the bathing solution contains not only weakly charged monovalent salt ions , but also polyvalent ions that are strongly electrostatically coupled to the charged macroions , mediating the interaction between them .",
    "a possible realization would correspond to a mixture of multivalent ions in a bathing solution of monovalent ions , a situation rather typical in the context of e.g. semiflexible biopolymers , where multivalent ions are believed to play a key role in their condensation @xcite . with the presence of polyvalent ions in the system , the wc paradigm in general breaks down and",
    "the existence of ks interactions becomes dubious  @xcite .",
    "however , there exists a theory , the _ dressed ion theory _ , based on an asymmetric treatment of the different components of the bathing electrolyte solution , that would allow us to analyze the effect of charge reguation of macroions also in the presence of polyvalent salt ions in the bathing solution  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact , that one can use the wc dh approach in order to describe the monovalent salt ions , while a strong coupling ( sc ) approach is preferable for the polyvalent ion part .",
    "this combined _ weak - strong coupling _ approach  @xcite effectively leads to dressed interactions between polyvalent ions and thus also affects the interactions mediated by polyvalent counterions between two like charge - regulated macroions . the ensuing effective interactions between macroions",
    "would then correspond to a _",
    "generalized ks interaction _ , mediated by strongly coupled salt ions and not by weakly coupled monovalent salt .",
    "this generalized ks interaction would consequently also cease to be fluctuational in nature , i.e. of the type proposed in the original work of kirkwood and schumaker @xcite , but would show a different behavior stemming from the polyvalent ion mediated interactions coupled to the charge regulation response of the dissociation equilibrium at the macroion surfaces .    our approach as detailed below , is composed of disjoined parts brought together to describe this new type of generalized ks interaction , and a short _ guided tour _ through the conceptual and calculational flowchart is thus in order .",
    "the dissociable surfaces of the two identical macroions , representing two proteins with dissociable aminoacids , are described with a charge - regulation surface free energy that allows the effective charge to vary between a positive and a negative maximal value .",
    "we then contract the macroion to a point particle merely as a calculational device , since we can then disregard the angular distribution of the dissociable groups along the surface , remaining solely with the monopolar charge as the only characteristics of the macroion .",
    "the bathing solution for the macroions , assuming to be an ionic mixture of monovalent salt and polyvalent ions , is then treated within the _ dressed ion theory _ , i.e. the monovalent salt is described within the wc and the polyvalent ions within the sc paradigm , an approximate approach that has already proved valuable in other contexts  @xcite .",
    "we then further approximate the non - linear surface charge regulation free energy with a gaussian expansion proved to be a good description on the wc level  @xcite . finally , we study the obtained expressions for the effective generalized ks interaction between the macroions in the various parts of the parameter space and comment on the results",
    ".    the dressed ion theory , as a variant of the sc theory  @xcite , does not hold the same status as the _ original sc theory _",
    ", valid _ exactly _ for a counterion - only system in the limit of large coupling constant @xcite .",
    "in fact the regime of validity of this approach can be only checked against explicit - ion monte carlo simulations , showing that the dressed ion theory can indeed give quantitatively accurate results in a wide range of realistic parameter values @xcite .",
    "the system under consideration consists of two equal titratable macroions immersed in a bathing solution , itself composed of a mixture of monovalent salt ions as well as polyvalent ions of valency @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "two macroions , representing two titratable proteins , are located at @xmath2 and @xmath3 so that their separation is equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the macroions are assumed to be identical with a radius of @xmath5 and can have either sign . furthermore , the macroions are charge - regulated with adsorption sites which can exchange a proton from the environment , and are described with the lattice gas free energy , see below , with a site number coefficient of @xmath6 .",
    "thi simplies that there are twice as many proton adsorption / dissociation sites as there are negative fixed charges .",
    "this allows the total charge of the macroion to span negative as well as positive values , a basic tenet of our charge regulation model .",
    "the macroion charge is thus not fixed , but responds to the local solution conditions .",
    "we also assume that the macroions are `` small '' in the specific sense that the angular variation of the local electrostatic potential along their surface is negligible .",
    "this implies that we only deal with effective monopolar fluctuations , disregarding the subdominant higher multipolar fluctuations that would correspond to a generalization of the full van der waals interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the higher multipolar ks interactions remain as a possible future topic of our investigation .      for charge - regulated titratable macroions we have recently introduced several models  @xcite , based on a charge dissociation free energy that generalizes the law of mass action charge - regulation approach of ninham and parsegian  @xcite . in these models",
    "the charge regulation is described by a surface free energy @xmath7 that depends on the surface electrostatic potential @xmath8 . for each macroion",

    "we simplify matters by furthermore assuming that the macroions are spherical and of vanishing radius , i.e. they are point particles .",
    "of course this approximation will only work for sufficiently large separations between them and small separation regime would need to be analyzed separately .",
    "it will soon become clear why this type of approximation simplifies the calculation substantially .",

    "[ cagh ] , simply gives a total dissociation energy of the point - like macroion as a _ function _ of the local potential at the point @xmath14 .",
    "the point - like approximation for the macroion therefore disregards the angular variation of the local electrostatic potential along the surface of the macroions and can describe only monopolar charge regulation , while higher multipoles are ignored .    in the next step",
    "one needs to assume a model for @xmath15 .",
    "we already invoked several models  @xcite related to the original ninham - parsegian model  @xcite .",
    "focusing on a simple two - parameter model we introduce the following _ ansatz _ for a charge regulated point - like macroion  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is now the local electrostatic potential at the position of the ion , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two parameters characterizing the dissociation process .",
    "the site number coefficient @xmath19 quantifies the number of dissociation sites , and @xmath20 , incorporates the free energy of charge dissociation @xmath21 .    in the case of protonation of the titratable surface charge",

    "this is the generic charge regulation model that we will consider as a simple description of the protein charge regulation in what follows .",
    "we proceed by writing the partition function through the hubbard - stratonovich transform for the coulomb potential as explained in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this leads to a field theory , where the classical partition function is represented as a functional integral over the fluctuating electrostatic potential .",
    "two explicit exact limiting results are then obtainable from this representation in the case of a counterion - only system @xcite : the saddle - point of this field theory in fact corresponds to the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) approximation , while the gaussian fluctuation correction together with the pb theory constitutes the _ wc theory _ ; the first order virial expansion of the partition function then constitutes the _ sc theory _ , unrelated to the pb approximation .",
    "the latter can be further generalized in the case of a mixed system by treating the monovalent salt on the wc level while the polyvalent ions are described on the sc level , i.e. their contribution to the partition function is written as a second order virial expansion theory .",

    "the reason for this is not the polyion mediated electrostatic attraction but its size : in fact for small separation the polyvalent counterion can not enter the space between the macroions and thus exerts an additional effective osmotically generated attraction between them in general akin to the depletion effect , already noticed in a similar context for net - neutral surfaces at small separations @xcite . in the opposite case , when @xmath125 , the repulsion in general prevails , except at large separations where one can detect a small residual attraction , possibly as a consequence of an asymmetrical charge fluctuation due to charge regulation . at smaller separations the bare repulsion between macroions is reduced partly due to the charge regulation effects and partly due to depletion effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] one can additionally notice how the two cases , one with small @xmath106 , immersed in a solution of low salt concentration , and the other one with large @xmath106 , but immersed in concentrated salt solution , have quite similar behavior , indicating that the valency of the polyion and the screening of the monovalent salt somehow act in parallel .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] the total interaction energy is now compared for the two cases with and without charge regulation , eq .",
    "[ eq : f1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : f2 ] , respectively .",
    "the charge non - regulated case corresponds to fixed values of the macroion charge equal to @xmath126 .",
    "here , one can notice the important effect of charge regulation through the polyvalent mediated interaction , ruled by the @xmath0 value , which determines the overall strength of the charge regulation interaction , that can then appear as either smaller or larger than the one corresponding non - regulated interaction energy .",
    "this non - monotonic effect of charge regulation hinges on the two terms in the dressed ion free energy that respond differently to titration of the macroion charges .",
    "the dressed ion theory obviously predicts an attractive interaction between charge regulated macroions , which can sometimes dominate the overall interaction .",
    "this is different from the wc case  @xcite , where the fluctuation attraction , or the ks interaction , is subdominant to the dh repulsion , except close to the pzc , where it indeed becomes dominant . in the sc",
    "dressed ion theory the attraction can clearly become dominant either with or without the charge regulation , though it can be stronger in the latter case and remains important for any value of ph .",
    "the salt effect acts mostly to quench the correlation polyvalent ion - mediated attraction and diminish its spatial range .",
    "the attraction between two identical charge regulated macroions , seen in the dressed ion theory , has a different origin from the wc ks interactions , where they are due to thermal monopolar charge fluctuations around the mean - field solution , enabled by the dissociation equilibrium of the surface of the macroion . in the dressed ion theory ,",
    "the polyvalent ion - mediated attraction could be seen as being due to the _ electrostatic bridging interaction _ involving the polyvalent ion .",
    "this should in general not be confused with the s.c .",
    "_ salt bridging interaction _ sometimes invoked even in weakly coupled monovalent salt solutions .",
    "the main goal of this research was to present a theoretical description for the phenomenon of charge regulation as affected by the presence of polyvalent ions .",
    "we formulated a sc dressed ion theory , describing the electrostatic interactions between macroions undergoing charge regulation processes , in a mixture of monovalent - polyvalent salt solution . using the proper description of charge regulation , suitable for treating it in the field theoretical framework ,",
    "the partition function is derived in the form of a virial expansion valid for small concentration of the polyvalent salt .",
    "the first term in such expansion corresponds to the direct interaction between titratable macroions in a monovalent salt solution , while the first order correction , stems from the interaction of the polyvalent ion with each macroion .",
    "the asymmetry in the ionic solution allowed us to decouple the system into the monovalent salt component , addressed on a week coupling level , while the polyvalent ion component was assumed to be strongly coupled with macroions . in both cases ,",
    "titration of the macroions is treated on the gaussian approximation level involving an expansion of the exact charge regulation free energy valid in general for highly charged macroions    we have shown that the presence of polyvalent ion brings about a strong attraction between two symmetrically charged macroions . in the case when polyvalent ion acts like a counterion , the attraction is big enough to overcome repulsion between the macroions , while in the opposite case , the repulsion between macroions turns into a small attraction at large separations due to the asymmetric charge fluctuations at macroions surface , induced by the presence of the polyvalent salt .",
    "the polyvalent - ion mediated attraction remains appreciable even at conditions , when macroions reach the point of zero charge . from the derived expressions for the free energy of interaction ,",
    "it is clear that the polyvalent ion - mediated attractive contribution stems from the charge - induced charge type of the interaction , since it is proportional to the square of the polyvalent ion charge .",
    "our results show that the polyvalent ion - mediated attraction is significantly stronger then the ks interaction , obtained for the same system described in the wc regime , i.e. without any polyvalent salt .",
    "we therefore derived a generalized form of the ks interaction , with the range of validity extended to the regime , where their original ks derivation fails .    by calculating the interaction between point - like charge regulated macroions in the wc and sc approximations , based within the field representation of the partition function ,",
    "we have opened a new way to analyze the interactions between proteins in ionic solutions .",
    "our approach brings together the charge regulation theory as well as the general wc and sc dichotomy of the field representation of the partition function of coulomb fluids .",
    "the results seem interesting and we will endeavor to compare them with detailed monte carlo simulations in the near future .",
    "the propagator @xmath127 , describing how the electrostatic potential propagates from one macroion to another in the presence of a polyvalent ion @xmath1 at @xmath57 , is given as :    @xmath128\\delta(\\varphi({\\bf r}_1)-\\varphi_1)\\delta(\\varphi({\\bf r}_2)-\\varphi_2 ) e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d{\\bf r}d{\\bf r } ' \\varphi({\\bf r})u_{dh}^{-1}({\\bf r } , { \\bf r } ' ) \\varphi({\\bf r } ' ) + i\\beta \\int_v \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\varphi({\\bf r } ) d{\\bf r}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath129 .",

    "our strategy now will be to first evaluate the functional integral over the fluctuating electrostatic potential field @xmath133 and then calculate the remaining integral over the auxiliary fields stemming from the fourier representation of the delta functions .",
