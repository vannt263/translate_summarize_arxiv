    "the possibility of phonon stimulated emission ( ) in activated crystals was considered as early as 1960s @xcite . yet , speculation about various mechanisms of phonon persists even today ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in experiments ,",
    "phonon was first observed and studied @xcite on dielectric crystals doped by fe - group paramagnetic ions .",
    "the effect manifests itself as the quantum paramagnetic amplification of a coherent microwave phonon flux ( hypersound ) when spin levels that may take part in spin - phonon interaction are inversely populated .",
    "this effect may be viewed as an acoustic analogue @xcite of maser amplification of electromagnetic waves @xcite ( not counting a number of features of nonlinear processes in the signal and pump channels @xcite ) .    at the same time",
    ", the mechanism of quantum _ generation _ of microwave acoustic oscillations , which was discovered experimentally in @xcite , has long remained unclear .",
    "the reasons were the attempts to draw analogy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) between acoustic quantum generators ( phasers ) and usual electromagnetic quantum generators of maser type , which does exist between related quantum amplifiers .",
    "in experimental studies @xcite of microwave acoustic in @xmath12:@xmath11 and @xmath2:@xmath11 crystals , it was shown that operation of microwave phaser generator is physically much closer to optical or near - infrared ( near- ) lasing than to operation of microwave maser generator .",
    "in fact , the hypersonic wavelength in a fabry - perot acoustic resonator ( ) is roughly 13  @xmath13 m ( i.e. , falls into the near- range ) .",
    "the quality factor @xmath14 of an , as well as the quality factor of electromagnetic cavities in many lasers , is high : @xmath15 @xcite ( certainly , this value is reached at liquid helium temperatures , when the non - resonant absorption of hypersound is low ) .",
    "therefore , experimental spectra of phasers operating in the autonomous regime @xcite sometimes are similar to those observed for class - b multimode solid - state lasers ( for which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times for active centers , @xmath19 is the lifetime of field excitations in the cavity ) .",
    "however , phasers differ radically from lasers in regard to the intrinsic quantum noise ( spontaneous emission ) intensity @xmath20 . since the velocity of hypersound @xmath21 is five orders of magnitude lower than the velocity of light",
    ", the frequency @xmath22 in a phaser with a hypersonic wavelength of 13  @xmath13 m lies in the range @xmath23  ghz @xcite , i.e. , is five orders of magnitude lower than in a laser .",
    "accordingly , the relative spontaneous emission intensity in a phaser is @xmath24 orders of magnitude lower than in a laser ( because @xmath20 grows as @xmath25 ) .",
    "in essence , a phaser may be considered as a _",
    "deterministic _ dynamic system throughout the intensity range available .",
    "this is of crucial importance for studying motion in systems with a complex stratified phase space .",
    "it is known that multiplicative noise ( including spontaneous emission in a nonlinear active medium ) affects the behavior of dynamic systems in a very intriguing manner @xcite , causing coarsening of the phase space topology @xcite , etc .",
    "earlier @xcite , we experimentally revealed strong dynamic narrowing of the spectra in a nonlinear with modulated electromagnetic pump of paramagnetic centers .",
    "this narrowing was attributed to the resonant destabilization of energy exchange between hypersonic ( microwave acoustic ) modes under ultra - low - frequency ( infrasonic ) forcing of ruby ( @xmath2:@xmath11 ) spin - phonon system .",
    "further investigation of this microwave deterministic system as a part of nonautonomous phaser allowed us to reveal its still more unexpected property : superslow large - scale laminar self - reconfigurations of the spectra akin to autowave motions @xcite .",
    "below , we report these experimental studies in details and discuss the nature of the phenomena observed .",
    "experiments were carried out by using a ruby phaser @xcite with the electromagnetic pump power @xmath26 periodically modulated at ultra - low ( infrasonic ) and low ( usual sonic ) frequencies : @xmath27  hz  @xmath28  khz ( hereafter , the factor @xmath29 will be omitted ) .",

    "the loaded acoustic quality factor @xmath139 of the ruby ( with the piezoelectric film on one of the acoustic mirrors ) was measured at @xmath140  k by the pulsed echo method at frequencies @xmath141  ghz . with @xmath142 and @xmath143",

    "this value is readily attained in the case of push - pull pump , which provides @xmath156 under the conditions of our experiments .",
    "since the frequency width @xmath157 of the line at the spin transition @xmath47 is @xmath158  @xmath159  mhz and the mode separation is as small as @xmath160  khz , single - mode changes to multimode one even if the pump threshold is exceeded slightly . for @xmath161  ghz and @xmath162  koe ,",

    "the free phaser generation begins in a damped oscillatory regime . for our system ,",
    "the frequency @xmath166 of these damped oscillations ( the so - called relaxation frequency @xcite ) lies in the low - frequency range , @xmath167  hz at @xmath168 @xcite .    in a free - running multimode phaser",
    ", the number of acoustic modes in acoustic microwave power spectra ( ) does not exceed about thirty even if @xmath169 .",
    "that is , the maximal width of for autonomous phaser generator ( @xmath170  khz @xmath171  mhz ) is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath157 , which is explained by the well - known tang - statz - demars mechanism ( exhaustion of power supplies for spatially - overlapping competing modes of ) @xcite .",
    "if magnetic field offset is absent , free phaser generation proceeds under near - steady - state conditions ( the integral intensity @xmath172 of multimode , which is registered by the hypersonic transducer on one of the mirrors , is virtually time independent ) .",
    "if the offset is small , @xmath173  oe , the value of @xmath172 also remains practically time independent . only with @xmath174 increasing up to @xmath175  oe ,",
    "the integral intensity @xmath172 of phonon oscillates weakly because few of the individual modes demonstrate small - scale moving along the frequency axis ( with correspondent changing of their intensities ) or decay at all @xcite . at @xmath176  oe , some of the free generation modes in becomes splitted .",
    "these splittings are usually of order of several kilohertz ( more rarely several tens of kilohertz ) , which is much less than @xmath177  khz ; the number of splitted modes is one or two ( three at most ) even if @xmath178  oe .",
    "the peak intensities of splitted components are much lower than that of unsplitted modes .",
    "this fine structure of modes under free generation regime is of oscillating character , with not only the spectral component amplitudes but also their frequency positions varying smoothly ( the latter within 10 khz ) .",
    "the only exceptions are narrow windows in sets of control parameters @xmath179 , where the spontaneous breaking of coherence takes place for one or two modes , causing small - scale phonon turbulence @xcite . in most cases",
    ", however , free microwave acoustic generation in a ruby phaser proceeds under near - steady - state regime even if the offset by static magnetic field is as large as @xmath178  oe .",
    "the situation changes when the pump modulation frequency lies near @xmath180  hz , where pronounced nonlinear low - frequency resonance is observed @xcite .",
    "if the depth of periodic modulation is small , the phonon integral intensity @xmath181 oscillates synchronously with the external force period : @xmath182 , where @xmath183 .",
    "as the pump modulation depth @xmath184 increases , the period of @xmath181 doubles according to the feigenbaum scenario @xmath185 , where @xmath186 successively takes values @xmath187 , which condense ( @xmath188 ) in the vicinity of a critical point @xmath189 .",
    "a further increase in the depth of modulation ( @xmath190 ) switches the phaser into the state of deterministic chaos @xcite . in the case of hard excitation ( for example , by a pulse of hypersound injected into the from the outside ) , a phaser with periodically modulated pump exhibits multistability of microwave acoustic ( branching of periodic and/or deterministic chaotic regimes of the phaser generation , which may accompanied by hysteresis ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the collision of a strange attractor with an unstable manifold that separates the upper periodic branch leads to so - called crises ( sharp changes of the basin of a strange attractor , which are accompanied by attractor reconfiguration ) @xcite .",
    "however , all the above phenomena were detected in @xcite by measuring @xmath181 .",
    "more detailed information about phaser destabilization by a periodic force can be extracted from the microwave spectral characteristics of phonon .",
    "it has been found ( fig.2 ) that , when the depth of modulation increases , modes of alternate in a stepwise manner and cover the entire spectrum of phaser generation ( for the fig.2 in the journal variants of this paper see @xcite ) .    a panoramic view of the shows that the position of each individual mode is apparently the same at all the stages of the alternations . in other words ,",
    "an individual mode may generate or not ( at this or that stage of evolution ) , but the position of every generating phonon mode is practically same , as the position of corresponding `` cold '' ( unpumped ) absorptive mode .",
    "strictly speaking , one can see small amplitude and frequency motions of modes if the sweep range of the spectrum analyzer is decreased by two or three orders of magnitude , but these small - scale motions are insufficient at the background of global chaotic reconfigurations of the under relaxational resonance .",
    "the described picture of resonant destabilization of the microwave phonon is typical for the whole range of the broad - band relaxational resonance at @xmath191  hz . in a number of cases , the intensity of the most powerful components of nonautonomous exceeds the intensity of the central component of an autonomous phaser by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum shown in fig.2 ( in discrete time ) illuminates the actual complicated motions in the spin - phonon system of an acoustic quantum generator , which is shaded by the integral value @xmath192 .",
    "a similar evolution of the was also observed in experiments , where pump was stationary , but magnetic field @xmath193 was modulated at relaxational resonance frequencies",
    "@xmath191  hz .     evolution of the phonon spectra near the low - frequency relaxational resonance at @xmath194  hz .",
    "the step between sequential registered stages of evolution @xmath195 is roughly equal to 1  s. ]    the mean lifetime of microwave phonon modes under the conditions shown in fig .",
    "2 is several tenths of a second .",
    "the modes pattern changes in an irregular manner , the mode distribution in is not repeated , etc .",
    "such a chaotic evolution of the phonon spectra took place over the entire frequency range @xmath196  hz , where resonant low - frequency destabilization of phaser generation and , accordingly , chaotic oscillations of @xmath192 were previously observed @xcite .      under the infrasonic - frequency modulation ( @xmath197  hz ) of pump or magnetic field , the destabilization of microwave phonon assumes another , laminar , character .",
    "unlike the case of relaxational resonance ( @xmath191  hz ) , the resonance at infrasonic frequencies @xmath7  hz is characterized by an extremely high correlation of spectral motions .",
    "if the modulation frequency @xmath5 is precisely tuned to the vertex @xmath198 of @xmath8-resonance and the depth of modulation is high ( close to 100% ) , the narrows roughly fourfold and has no greater than six or seven modes of microwave phonon .    with a small detuning @xmath199 of pump modulation frequency @xmath5 with respect to the vertex @xmath200 of the @xmath8-resonance ,",
    "these narrow spectra demonstrate regular self - reconfigurations with intriguing features .",
    "it was found experimentally that the period of the self - reconfigurations @xmath201 changes by several orders of magnitude when @xmath202 varies by no more than 1  hz .",
    "in addition , the period @xmath201 turned out to be incommensurate with the period @xmath203 of external force ( that is , the frequency @xmath204 generally is not a harmonic or subharmonic of the driving force frequency @xmath5 ) . in experiments , this shows up as the instability of states that have rational values @xmath205 .",
    "the essence of the revealed self - reconfigurations of the phonon spectra is the @xmath201-periodic unidirectional moving of the range of active ( i.e. generating ) modes along the -frequency axis @xmath22 if @xmath206 .",
    "this range typically comprises from three to seven microwave phonon modes .",
    "it is noteworthy that the frequency position of each of the modes remains nearly unchanged ( if higher order dynamic effects due to the nonstationary fine structure of the spectra @xcite are disregarded ) .",
    "only the position of the spectral part with active modes changes .",
    "thus , the ignition of new modes at one side of the ( beginning from some discrete starting position @xmath207 ) is accompanied by the extinguishing of the same number of modes at the opposite side of the .",
    "such a motion lasts until the phaser generation ceases completely ( at some discrete finishing position @xmath208 of the frequency axis @xmath22 ) . after a relatively short period of complete absence of phaser generation ( time of refractority ) , the process of global self - reconfiguration is repeated , starting from the same position @xmath207 on the frequency axis @xmath22 .",
    "the period @xmath201 of these unidirectional spectral motions remains the same if a set of control parameters does not change .",
    "on the screen of a spectrum analyzer , this evolution of the microwave phonon spectrum appears as the periodic motion of some mode cluster ( a set of simultaneously generating modes , having fixed own frequencies ) .",
    "typical sequences of microwave phonon spectra at the @xmath8-resonance conditions ( @xmath209  hz , @xmath210  hz ) in the absence of static magnetic field offset ( @xmath211 ) are shown in fig.3 .",
    "evolution of the phonon spectra near the ultra - low frequency @xmath8-resonance at @xmath212  hz .",
    "the step between sequential registered stages of evolution @xmath195 is about 2.5  s. ]    an instantaneous set of microwave phonon modes forms a cluster of certain width , and this width varies insignificantly during the spectral motion ( fig.3 ) . at the same time , a set of _ individual _ modes ( that form active cluster ) permanently varies ( see disrete positions @xmath6 of generating modes @xmath213 for successive snapshots",
    "@xmath195 at fig.3 ) .",
    "as follows from fig.3 , such the self - reconfigurations of the are imposed on irregular oscillations of the se mode intensity .",
    "when the sweep range of the spectrum analyzer is decreased by two or three orders of magnitude , very weak irregular motions of modes along the frequency axis @xmath214 and sometimes splittings of these modes are observed ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the modes split when their intensity are very low , e.g. before extinguishing ( because of this , the instrument noise is noticeable in fig.4 ) .",
    "obviously , such fine effects can not be seen on panoramic spectra in fig.3 , where the positions of @xmath213 are apparently fixed ( the fine structure of the in an autonomous ruby phaser was studied by us in @xcite ) .",
    "in general , it can be said that large - scale ordered ( laminar ) motions of spectra in a phaser with infrasonic - frequency pump modulation are imposed on small - scale irregular motions .",
    "similar large - scale laminar self - reconfigurations of phonon microwave spectra in a nonautonomous ruby phaser were observed in experiments at @xmath215  hz ; however , the cluster moved in the opposite direction .",
    "further investigations showed that the sign of the derivative @xmath216 ( here , @xmath217 is the center frequency of a mode cluster ) strictly correlates with the sign of frequency detuning of the external force from resonance : @xmath218 = -{\\mathrm{sgn } } \\delta_\\lambda$ ] .",
    "going toward the exact @xmath8-resonance discovered ( @xmath219 ) , the self - reconfigurations period @xmath201 takes giant values .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath220 gave @xmath221  hz ( one self - reconfiguration period is @xmath222 hours ! ) .",
    "all the experiments on measuring of @xmath201 were performed with superfluid helium ( @xmath140  k ) in order to avoid problems associated with cryogenic liquid boiling .",
    "such a character of self - reconfigurations was observed not only for zero - offset of static magnetic field ( @xmath211 ) ; it persists over a wide range of @xmath223 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath224  oe , the value of @xmath200 even remains almost constant ( close to 9.8  hz ) .",
    "only when the magnetic field offset modulo @xmath225 increases further , does the resonance frequency @xmath200 decrease tangibly ( about twofold for @xmath226  oe ) .",
    "it is essential that the above dependence of the motion direction of an mode cluster on the modulation frequency detuning , @xmath218 = -{\\mathrm{sgn } } \\delta_\\lambda$ ] , remains valid .",
    "along with the discontinuous regimes of phaser generation ( which include the time of refractority at each period of the self - reconfigurations ) , we also observed regimes without refractorities .",
    "for such the regimes at least one mode appears in the starting range before the last mode in the finishing range disappears .",
    "in other words , there are two narrow mode clusters ( at the @xmath22 axis ) during some part @xmath227 of the self - reconfiguration period .",
    "the virtual vertici of these clusters @xmath228 and @xmath229 are moving simultaneously along the @xmath22 axis in the same direction and with the same velocity : @xmath230 during @xmath227 .",
    "the same effect was observed at the first three _ even _ harmonics of @xmath8-resonance , i.e. at @xmath231 , where @xmath232 . as for the fundamental @xmath8-resonance ( for which @xmath233 ) , in the case of poined lowest @xmath234-resonances correspondent periods of the self - reconfigurations @xmath235 are incommensurate with the external force period @xmath203 .",
    "experiments at @xmath140  k show , that these periods @xmath235 are increasing up to 100  s and more if the absolute values of detunings @xmath236 are small ( less than 0,05 - 0,1  hz ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath216 ( or @xmath237 $ ] , @xmath238 $ ] for off - refractority regimes ) was opposite to the sign of @xmath239 ( as in the case of the fundamental @xmath8-resonance ) .    with @xmath240 ,",
    "the driving force frequency @xmath5 falls into the range of broad - band relaxation resonance ( @xmath241  hz ) described above .",
    "however , for @xmath242 ( when the driving force leaves this range of resonant destabilization ) experiments again distinctly revealed narrow - band resonant responses of the generating phaser system to the pump modulation .",

    "responses of the ruby phaser at the pointed high harmonics ( both even and odd ) somewhat differ from those in the case of fundamental resonance @xmath8-resonance and its first even harmonics .",
    "for example , at @xmath242 , the deviation of @xmath217 is , as a rule , no greater than one or two mode separations ( i.e. , no greater than 0,30,6  mhz ) . besides of this , at @xmath242 , modes experience deep periodic automodulation ( of depth 50% or more ) .    at @xmath242 ( @xmath245  hz ) and with detunings",

    "as @xmath5 approaches the top of each of the @xmath234- or @xmath247- resonances ( at the same @xmath242 ) , the automodulation period @xmath248 , as well as the period @xmath201 of the self - reconfigurations at @xmath249 and lower even harmonics ( @xmath250 ) , increases monotonically .",
    "the highest values of @xmath248 , which were stably observed at @xmath251 , reached several minutes for @xmath140  k. note that the same `` blinking '' regimes of phonon ( but with smaller automodulation depths ) were also found for the first two _ odd _ harmonics ( @xmath252 and @xmath253 ) , where `` great '' self - reconfigurations of the are absent .",
    "our experimental data for infrasonic - frequency - modulated phaser suggest spin - phonon self - organization caused by intermode energy exchange at hypersonic frequencies . it should be emphasized that under infrasonic @xmath8-resonance highly organized collective motions in the spin - phonon system",
    "are observed not only for each of individual microwave acoustic modes ( as in the case of autonomous multimode phaser generation ) but also at the global level , where all se modes obey the same rhythm ( the frequency of which is not a harmonic / subharmonic of an external perturbation ) . in other words ,",
    "if upon autonomous multimode phaser generation there exist @xmath6 virtually independent microwave oscillators ( each corresponding to a specific se mode ) , at a resonant infrasonic perturbation of the pump or magnetic field , these oscillators behave consistently ( cooperatively ) .",
    "the same phenomenon of global - level self - organization in ruby phaser was observed by us at some higher harmonics of the fundamental @xmath8-resonance ( outside of the broad - band relaxational resonance , having low ,  but not infrasonic ,  fundamental frequency ) .",
    "the features of collective motions in a phaser suggest that this effect is similar to antiphase dynamics processes @xcite , which were discovered previously in multimode lasers . in the simple case of two - mode lasing @xcite ,",
    "antiphase dynamics appears as consistent oscillations of modes strictly in antiphase . in @xmath6-mode systems",
    ", antiphase motions may be much more complicated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , the general nontrivial tendency , namely , coherent unidirectional se mode oscillations with a time delay @xmath254 between nearest neighbors , still persists .    as was found in this work , energy exchange between microwave phonon modes in a phaser results in an additional characteristic frequency @xmath200 , which is much lower than the relaxation frequency @xmath166 .",
    "collective motions are excited when a control parameter ( pump or magnetic field ) of the active system is modulated at frequencies close to @xmath200 .",
    "the same is true for lasers exhibiting antiphase dynamics @xcite .",
    "accordingly , phonon spectral self - reconfigurations may be treated as the occurrence of antiphase states in phaser system when the spatial distribution of stationary hypersonic modes is destabilized by an external force at infrasonic frequencies @xmath255 ( or its harmonics ) . moreover ,",
    "the value of @xmath200 estimated by formulas given in @xcite ( see appendix 1 ) is one order of magnitude lower than @xmath166 , which is also in agreement with our experimental data for nonautonomous phaser generation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the laser model of nonlinear dynamics of microwave phonon can not describe adequately all features of self - organization in a phaser near @xmath8-resonance and its harmonics , although it gives a satisfactory estimate of @xmath200 and predicts more or less accurately the character of mode motions .    for a better understanding of self - organization in a ruby phaser , one should consider the unusual hierarchy of spin reservoirs @xcite , which are responsible for many features of the quantum transitions saturation ( both electromagnetic and acoustic ) in the microwave range .",
    "essentially , all nonlinearities showing up in microwave resonant interactions of the signal acoustic field and the electromagnetic pump field with the electron zeeman reservoir @xmath256 @xcite of @xmath257 ions in ruby phaser are sensitive to the presence of slowly relaxing @xmath258 nuclei , as revealed in our early experiments on hypersound quantum amplification @xcite .",
    "the reason for this sensitivity is the direct thermal interaction @xcite between the nuclear zeeman reservoir @xmath259 and electronic dipole - dipole ( @xmath260 ) reservoir @xmath261 .",
    "this interaction leads to energy exchange between electronic and nuclear spin reservoirs : @xmath262 .",
    "it is important that the heat capacities of the reservoirs @xmath259 and @xmath256 are comparable to each other , although the frequency of nuclear magnetic resonance ( ) for @xmath258 ( @xmath171  mhz ) is three orders of magnitude lower than the and frequencies for @xmath257 ions at @xmath263  koe .",
    "this is because the concentration of impurity @xmath257 paramagnetic ions @xmath257 in pink ruby is as low as several hundredths of a percent ; that is , for one electron spin , there are several thousands of nuclear spins . as a result ,",
    "the inertial nuclear system , while unseen in direct and measurements , participates in all population redistributions over electron spin levels ( in more exact terms , over a quasicontinuous set of sublevels due to dipole - dipole interactions @xcite ) .",
    "returning back to the @xmath8-resonance , we may assume that the observed decrease in its frequency at static magnetic field mismatches is caused by @xmath258 nuclear spin - system , which is thermally connected to @xmath257 electronic spin - system .",
    "more precisely , @xmath259 is involved ( by the direct thermal contact to @xmath261 and by the indirect one to @xmath256 ) in energy exchange between microwave acoustic modes .",
    "in fact , the most important feature of interaction between the saturated electron subsystem and polarized nuclear subsystem is the strong dependence of the spin temperatures ( in all the three reservoirs @xmath256 , @xmath261 , @xmath259 ) on static magnetic field mismatches and/or saturating microwave field detunings in ruby phaser ( see our early experimental works @xcite ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the effect of the low - energy ( combined ) reservoir @xmath264 on the high - energy reservoir @xmath256 in a phaser differs radically from the effect of similar low - energy reservoir in optical lasers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the matter is that , in our system , the relative heat capacity and inertia of combined low - energy reservoir are much greater than in @xmath265 lasers @xcite .",
    "first , in our system , as was noted above , for one active center @xmath257 there are several thousands of magnetic nuclei @xmath258 , which make a low - energy reservoir `` heavier '' , while in @xmath265 lasers , the low- and high - energy reservoirs are formed by the same @xmath265 molecules ( the low - energy reservoir is formed here by rotational - vibrational degrees of freedom of @xmath265 molecules ) .",
    "so , in a @xmath265 laser , there are analogues to the reservoirs @xmath256 and @xmath261 , but that laser does not have an analogue to the reservoir @xmath259 .",
    "second ( and most important ) , the relaxation time of the low - energy reservoir in ruby phaser is much longer than the relaxation time of the high - energy reservoir @xcite , while _ the reverse _ is true for @xmath265 laser @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a ruby phaser , the combined inertial reservoir @xmath264 is involved in the leading self - organization processes which always the slowest processes are .",
    "we experimentally studied the influence of an external periodic force on the dynamics of microwave phonon stimulated emission in a ruby phaser at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "it is shown that the periodic modulation of pump ( or static magnetic field ) at low frequencies @xmath191  hz chaotizes energy exchange in the spin - phonon system because of resonant destabilization of a phaser near its relaxation resonance frequency @xmath166 . in this range of destabilization ,",
    "the width of the phonon microwave power spectrum does not noticeably change .",
    "for ultra - low ( infrasonic ) frequencies of pump modulation ( @xmath266  hz ) , a qualitatively new kind of phonon destabilization is discovered .",
    "first , the narrows considerably ( almost four times ) . instead of fast chaotic modes",
    "alternations , the self - organized periodic slow motions of modes near the vertex of the @xmath8-resonance are observed .",
    "period of these motions may exceed the period of the driving force by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the phonon self - organization is of a global type : cooperative behaviour in the infrasonically - modulated phaser includes the whole spin - phonon system generating microwave phonons ( unlike conventional `` inividualistic '' intramode self - organization , which is typical of multimode lasers ) .",
    "self - organization shows up as slow consistent regular pulsations of each of microwave phonon modes with a time delay @xmath267 .",
    "this appears as autowave motion of a mode cluster in the spectral space .",
    "the total self - reconfiguration cycle of depends considerably on @xmath268 and changes by several orders of magnitude when @xmath269 changes by several percent .",
    "the same processes were observed for the first three even harmonics of the fundamental @xmath8-resonance . for higher even harmonics , as well as for all odd harmonics , `` blinking ''",
    "periodic regimes are discovered ( outside of wide - band low - frequency relaxational resonance ) .",
    "the results obtained are treated in terms of the antiphase dynamics of phonon .",
    "the role of the @xmath258 magnetic nuclear subsystem ( witn mhz - range -frequencies ) in self - organization of ghz - range phonon is discussed .",
    "the author is grateful to e.  d.  makovetsky ( karazin national university , kharkov ) and s.  d.  makovetskiy ( kharkov national university of radioelectronics ) for their valuable help with computer processing of the experimental data , to a.  p.  korolyuk ( institute of radiophysics and electronics of ) for interest in the study of phaser dynamics , and to p.  mandel ( universit libre de bruxelles ) for the kindly submitted publications on antiphase dynamics . finally , the author is indebted to academician v.  m.  yakovenko and all participants of his seminar for discussion and valuable comments on nonlinear phenomena in phaser system .",
