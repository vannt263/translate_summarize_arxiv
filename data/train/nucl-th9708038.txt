    "the dynamics of @xmath0 scattering is often described by effective meson - exchange in the t - channel .",
    "the mechanism of t - channel exchange works very well in , for example , nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , for @xmath0 scattering one may also consider the presence of the many resonances in the s - channel , a feature that is typical for @xmath0 scattering but not for nucleon - nucleon scattering . a list of relevant meson resonances with their properties can be obtained from the compilation of the particle data group  @xcite . for energies larger than 1 gev ,",
    "an additional aspect is the strong coupling of the @xmath0 channel to @xmath1 and multi - pion channels , for example , four and six pions .",
    "previous models for s - wave @xmath0 scattering have been applied from threshold to 1.4 gev .",
    "for example , separable potential models have been considered in an approach  @xcite in which the major focus was to obtain the proper low energy behavior of the @xmath0 s - wave phase shift , using the right combination of attraction and repulsion in the diagonal @xmath0 interaction , and also to better understand the structure of the meson resonance @xmath12(980 ) .",
    "more sophisticated one - meson exchange models  @xcite have been used up to 2 gev , still within the framework of coupling @xmath0 and @xmath13 channels .    in an earlier paper  @xcite we reported on results within a coupled three - channel model for s - wave scattering in the 1.0  2.0 gev energy region , and we were encouraged by its results when compared to the then available s - wave data . the relevant experimental @xmath0 phase shifts and inelasticities , specifically @xmath14 , can be found from the analysis by protopopescu et al  @xcite , grayer et al  @xcite , hyams et al  @xcite , bugg et al  @xcite and kaminsky et al  @xcite .",
    "these groups have extracted the pion - pion scattering amplitudes in the @xmath15 0.60  1.78 gev region by obtaining them from an analysis of the reaction @xmath6 p @xmath16 n. kaminsky et al included also data from the same reaction with a polarized proton target , which allowed them to separate the contributions due to @xmath4 and @xmath17 exchange .",

    "we do not know of any data above 1.78 gev , so a model reproducing the existing data may eventually also serve as a basis for extrapolation to higher energies .",
    "such an extrapolation would be required to study for example the final state interaction in the process @xmath19  @xcite .    in view of the presence of an extensive set of resonances",
    "as given by the particle data group  @xcite , we have opted in this paper for inclusion of the various known resonances in our model for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "one can then address the question , what is the role of these resonances for elastic @xmath0 scattering in the various partial waves in the region of 0.3  2.0 gev . in the energy range up to 2.0 gev",
    "the dominant channels are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath20 . within our model ,",
    "as no spin effects have been taken into account , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels can be described by a single effective channel , e.g. @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the set of s - wave resonances that play a role for the @xmath0 channel are the @xmath12(980 ) and @xmath12(1370 ) resonances , but one should also include the recently discovered @xmath12(1500 ) . while many conjectures about the nature of the @xmath12(1500 ) have been made , its role for @xmath0 scattering is still an open question , and therefore will be one of the questions addressed in this paper .",
    "another question is the @xmath21 value of the reported @xmath10 resonance .",
    "so far one only agrees that @xmath21 should be even  @xcite . in this approach",
    "one can study the implications of the presence of an isoscalar @xmath22 resonance for s - wave @xmath0 scattering , as well as the implications of the existence of an isoscalar @xmath23 resonance for d - wave @xmath0 scattering . in practice",
    "we will impose the condition that the scattering matrix , corresponding to a particular angular momentum , should have poles at the complex energies of known resonances with appropriate quantum numbers and , from this input , one can study the implications for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the model that we will describe , can be applied for any angular momentum . in this paper",
    "it will be applied for s , p , d and f - waves . for each angular momentum",
    "the important input will be the location of the corresponding resonances as given by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "sections ii and iii describe the model and show the analytic expressions of the s - matrix for the various angular momenta . in sections iv and v the results for respectively @xmath24 = 0 and @xmath24 = 2 are discussed .",
    "this order of angular momenta is chosen because the resonance @xmath10 may either contribute to the s - wave or d - wave scattering .",
    "then the results for @xmath24 = 1 and @xmath24 = 3 are described in sections vi and vii respectively .",
    "finally a discussion of all results and conclusions follows in section viii .",

    "we have before published results  @xcite for a three coupled channel model as described in section ii .",
    "one obtains impressive results for phase shifts as well as inelasticities in the energy region 0.9  2.0 gev .",
    "however , within the model described in section ii it is not possible to obtain a realistic description at energies below 0.9 gev .",
    "the reason is that the potential for the @xmath0 channel for the s - channel requires an attractive term as well as a repulsive one .",
    "it has been earlier demonstrated  @xcite that addition of a second term in the s - wave @xmath95 potential is successful in describing the low energy behavior of the @xmath24 = 0 scattering .",
    "we develop therefore a formalism , described in appendix b , adding such an attractive term . in this paper",
    "this formalism is only applied for @xmath24 = 0 scattering .",

    "these three @xmath21 = 0 resonances together will impose constraints on the analytic expression for the s - matrix for @xmath24 = 0 .",
    "the s - matrix must have three poles at the corresponding three complex energies .",
    "these constraints determine or restrict the possible values of the model parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where , as stated in appendix b , the index 0 labels the second potential term of the @xmath100 channel . using these parameter values",
    ", one can then immediately determine the s - submatrix @xmath79 , describing @xmath101 scattering .",

    "@xmath104    one obtains the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 as a function of energy .",
    "the @xmath24 = 0",
    "scattering parameters are then compared to experimental data .",
    "there is still an additional freedom in our model .",
    "this is related to the location of the resonance in the complex energy plane and to the analytic structure of the s - matrix for the three coupled channels @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "this defines two possible sheets in the complex energy plane for each channel . because there are three channels , there are all together eight sheets .",

    "the sign of i m  @xmath56 is such that the momenta @xmath56 are all close to the physical scattering region .",

    "has a preference to decay into @xmath110 , @xmath111 , 4@xmath112 , 2@xmath112 and 2@xmath1132@xmath6 .",

    "we therefore conclude that the data for @xmath18 scattering are consistent with a @xmath9 resonance that is very different from the @xmath114 and @xmath115 and that it couples only weakly to @xmath18 . at the same time",
    "these data do not require its coupling to @xmath1 to be also weak .",
    "the next question is if these data are consistent with the existence of a @xmath22 resonance . indeed it is possible with resonance poles at the complex masses ( 1.200 , -0.250 ) and ( 1.697 , -0.300 ) to obtain an excellent prediction for the phase shift in the 1.0  1.5 gev region that is in good agreement with the experimental data . in fig .",

    "first , in case a we impose on our model the existence of three resonances in @xmath21 = 2 at complex energies ( 1.275 , -0.092 ) , ( 1.525 , -0.038 ) and ( 1.607 , -0.088 ) gev , while in the second case b the existence of three resonances at ( 1.275 , -0.092 ) , ( 1.525 , -0.038 ) and ( 2.011 .",

    "however , it turns out that neither case a nor case b allows a solution within our model if we demand that all three resonances are on the standard sheet for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( i.e. where all relative channel momenta have imaginary parts close to the physical region ) . on the other hand solutions for both cases",
    "are found , if we locate the second resonance @xmath120 on the @xmath0 sheet , where the relative @xmath0 momentum has a positive imaginary part .",
    "a physical interpretation of this would be that the coupling of the @xmath120 resonance to the @xmath0 channel is weak , meaning that @xmath120 has a rather small decay width into @xmath0 .",
    "the particle data group gives that @xmath120 decays for only 0.8% into @xmath0 while for 88.8% into @xmath1 , which would justify to put the @xmath120 pole not on the standard @xmath0 sheet near the physical region , but place it on the alternative @xmath0 sheet , where i m @xmath121 @xmath105 0 .",
    "proceeding , the model gives results for case a as well as for case b closest to the data if the third resonance is put on the non - standard @xmath2 sheet .",
    "then for case a , which contains the @xmath23 resonance , the parameter set is given in the first line of table  [ table : lval2 ] , and the model predictions for the phase shift and inelasticity are given by the dashed line in fig .",

    "one finds that for case b the predicted inelasticity ( see fig .",
    "6 ) is in much better agreement with the experimental inelasticity .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the presence of a @xmath23 resonance would cause more structure in the @xmath24 = 2 phase shift than has been observed experimentally , and a value of @xmath21 = 2 for @xmath10 is therefore unlikely .",
    "following again the formalism of section ii , the resonances imposed for @xmath24 = 1 are @xmath73(770 ) , @xmath73(1450 ) and @xmath73(1700 ) .",

    "therefore the existence of these three @xmath21 = 1 resonances again imposes the constraints that the analytic expression for the s - matrix for @xmath24 = 1 has three poles at these three complex energies .",

    "there is no agreement between the different experimental data sets .",

    "the corresponding parameter set is given in the second line of table  [ table : lval1 ] , and the corresponding prediction of the phase shift and inelasticity is given as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : figdel1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : figeta1 ] . comparing with the dashed curve",
    ", a dramatic improvement has been obtained for the phase shift .",
    "a structure near 1.6  1.7 gev remains however present in the model .",
    "there may be an indication of some structure in one set of experimental phase shifts , but it is far from compelling .",
    "the corresponding model prediction for the inelasticity includes for this case a larger effect of the @xmath1 channel , as shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figeta1 ] .",
    "as long as the experimental data for the inelasticity suffer from the considerable internal disagreement as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figeta1 ] , it is hard to draw conclusive information from a comparison of this observable at this time .",
    "other choices of possible sheets do not lead to further improvement of the predictions .",
    "for @xmath88 = @xmath126 there is one well established resonance @xmath127(1690 ) , at ( 1.691 , -0.080 ) gev , and a brief mentioning of @xmath128 .",
    "since we are interested in the phase shift below 2.0 gev , the precise location of higher poles seems not very important . within our model , having the essential ingredient of three channels and therefore nine parameters , a single resonance would allow too much freedom in the parameters . just for convenience",
    "we impose therefore the condition that there are three resonances , even for @xmath88 = @xmath126 , at energies ( 1.691 , -0.080 ) , ( 2.250 , -0.125 ) , ( 2.700 , -0.300 ) gev . in that case",
    "it is straightforward to obtain a good fit to the experimental phase shift and inelasticity by the parameter set given in table  [ table : lval3 ] .",
    "the model prediction for that set is given as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : figdel3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : figeta3 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have constructed a three - channel model which gives a reasonable description of the s , p , d and f - wave @xmath0 scattering in the 0.3  1.7 gev region .",
    "apart from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , the multi - pion channels are described as effective @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels . as a result",
    "the model exhibits branch cuts at the @xmath1 and @xmath129 thresholds .",
    "subsequently we require the s - matrix to have poles at the three lowest known resonances for each angular momentum @xmath96 as listed by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "the position of the resonances on the various complex momentum sheets reflects the decay properties of each resonance .    as a by - product of this investigation one concludes that the @xmath9 resonance plays a role in s - wave @xmath18 scattering that is quite different from that of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "also the s - wave and d - wave @xmath18 scattering data seem to be in better agreement with a value of @xmath21 = 0 for @xmath10 and at the same time in disagreement with a value of @xmath21 = 2 .",
    "a further surprise for the @xmath96 = @xmath130 meson resonances is that not all three resonances @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , play a similar role in all three channels of this model .    in order to establish how model dependent these conclusions are",
    ", it would be interesting to study the role of the various resonances off all angular momenta in other approaches  @xcite .",
    "the present model can also be extremely useful to describe the final state interaction in reactions like @xmath19  @xcite .",
