    "it is now observationally well established that the universe is close to flat and that matter accounts for about ( 25 - 30 ) percent of the total energy density most of which must be in the form of dark matter ( dm ) particles .",
    "candidates of dark matter particles are generally classified according to their velocity dispersion which defines a free - streaming length . on scales smaller than the free - streaming length ,",
    "fluctuations in the dark matter density are erased and gravitational clustering is suppressed . the velocity dispersion of cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles is by definition so small that the corresponding free - streaming length is irrelevant for cosmological structure formation . that of hot dark matter ( hdm ) , e.g. light neutrinos , is only one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of light , and smoothes out fluctuations in the total matter density even on galaxy cluster scales , which leads to strong bounds on their mass and density @xcite .",
    "between these two limits , there exists an intermediate range of dark matter candidates generically called warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "if such particles are initially in thermal equilibrium , they decouple well before ordinary neutrinos . as a result",
    "their temperature is smaller and their free - streaming length shorter than that of ordinary neutrinos .",
    "for instance , thermal relics with a mass of order @xmath7  kev and a density @xmath8 would have a free - streaming length comparable to galaxy scales ( @xmath9  mpc ) .",
    "there exist many wdm candidates whose origin is firmly rooted in particle physics .",
    "a prominent example is the gravitino , the supersymmetric partner of the graviton .",
    "the gravitino mass @xmath10 is generically of the order of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the scale of supersymmetry breaking and @xmath13 is the planckian scale . if @xmath12 is large the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is then not the gravitino , decouples in the non - relativistic regime and provides a viable cdm candidate .",
    "if , however , @xmath14 gev , as predicted by theories where supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gauge interactions , the gravitino is likely to be the lsp .",
    "such a light gravitino has a wide range of possible masses ( from @xmath15ev up to the kev region ) .",
    "the gravitino  or better to say its helicity 1/2 component ",
    "decouples when it is still relativistic . at this time",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the universe is typically of order one hundred , much larger than at neutrino decoupling .",
    "the effective gravitino temperature is therefore always smaller than the neutrino temperature , and such light gravitinos can play the role of wdm @xcite .",
    "their velocity dispersion is non - negligible during the time of structure formation , but smaller than the velocity dispersion of active neutrinos with the same mass .",
    "other particles may decouple even earlier from thermal equilibrium while still relativistic and may act as warm dark matter .",
    "the same is true for right - handed or sterile neutrinos added to the standard electroweak theory .",
    "since their only direct coupling is to left - handed or active neutrinos , the most efficient production mechanism is via neutrino oscillations .",
    "if the production rate is always less than the expansion rate , then these neutrinos will never be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , enough of them may be produced to account for the observed matter density .",
    "right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos with a mass of order kev are therefore natural wdm candidates @xcite .    the suppression of structures on scales of a mpc and smaller , in wdm models with a particle mass of @xmath16 1 kev , has been invoked as a possible solution to two major apparent conflicts between cdm models and observations in the local universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first problem concerns the inner mass density profiles of simulated dark matter halos that are generally more cuspy than inferred from the rotation curves of many dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "secondly , n - body simulations of cdm models predict large numbers of low mass halos greatly in excess of the observed number of satellite galaxies in the local group .",
    "it appears , however , difficult to find wdm parameters which solve all apparent cdm problems simultaneously and it is also not clear whether the tension between theory and observations is due to an inappropriate comparison of numerical simulations and observational data .",
    "the main difficulty is that the modeling of the inner density profile of galaxies and the abundance of satellite galaxies requires simulations on scales where the matter density field is highly non - linear at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , many of the relevant baryonic processes are poorly understood .    at @xmath17 the gravitational clustering of the matter distribution spectrum at scales larger than the free streaming length of a thermal @xmath18 wdm particle is still in the mildly non - linear regime . at these redshift high - resolution lyman-@xmath1  forest data",
    "offer an excellent probe of the matter power spectrum at these scales .",
    "narayanan et al .",
    "@xcite compared the flux power spectrum and flux probability distribution of a small sample of high resolution quasar ( qso ) absorption spectra to that obtained from numerical dark matter simulations . in this way they were able to constrain the mass of a thermal wdm particle ( assumed to account for all the dark matter in the universe ) to be @xmath19 .",
    "we will use here the linear dm power spectrum inferred from two large samples of qso absorption spectra @xcite using state  of  the  art hydrodynamical simulations @xcite combined with cosmic microwave background data from wmap in order to obtain new constraints on the mass of possible thermally distributed wdm particles .",
    "we thereby assume that wdm particles account for all the dm in our universe and we do not put any priors on their temperature .",
    "we will also further investigate constraints on the mass of light gravitinos with realistic effective temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we will describe the effect of wdm on the power spectrum of the matter distribution . in section iii we will summarize the method used in inferring the linear matter power spectrum from lyman-@xmath1 forest observations and discuss the systematic errors involved .",
    "in section iva we will derive a lower limit for the mass of the dark matter particle in a pure @xmath20wdm model . in section ivb",
    ", we will obtain an upper limit for the mass of light gravitinos in a mixed @xmath20cwdm universe .",
    "section v contains our conclusions and some comments on the implications of our results for particle physics .",
    "standard neutrinos are believed to decouple from the plasma when they are still relativistic , slightly before electron - positron annihilation .",
    "they will keep the equilibrium distribution of a massless fermion with temperature @xmath21 .",
    "their total mass summed over all neutrino species and their density are related through the well - known relation @xmath22 in the instantaneous decoupling limit .",
    "this result does , however , not apply to wdm for which : ( i ) either decoupling takes place earlier , ( ii ) or the particles were never in thermal equilibrium .",
    "if decoupling takes place at temperature @xmath23 while there are @xmath24 degrees of freedom the particles do not share the entropy release from the successive annihilations and their temperature is suppressed today by a factor @xmath25 as is the case e.g. for gravitinos .",
    "if the particles have never been in thermal equilibrium , there is a wide range of possible models .",
    "we will restrict our analysis here to the case of sterile neutrinos created from oscillations with active neutrinos , which share the same phase  space distribution but with an overall suppression factor @xmath26 . in both cases ,",
    "the number density of wdm is smaller than that of standard neutrinos , and the same present - day non - relativistic energy density corresponds to a larger particle mass , @xmath27 with @xmath28 for early decoupled thermal relics and @xmath29 for sterile neutrinos . due to their free - streaming velocity ,",
    "wdm particles slow down the growth of structure and suppress the total matter power spectrum @xmath30 on scales smaller than their free - streaming scale which is roughly given by @xmath31 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that there exist different definitions of the free - streaming or damping scale .",
    "the effect of the free streaming on the matter distribution can be described by a relative `` transfer function '' , @xmath32^{1/2 } \\label{transdef}\\ ] ] which is simply the square root of the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of wdm to that in the presence of purely cold dark matter , for fixed cosmological parameters .    since we allowed for an arbitrary normalization factor @xmath26 , the three parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent .",
    "note , however , that the evolution equations for wdm as well as the corresponding terms in the einstein equations can be reparametrized entirely in terms of two parameters , for instance @xmath33 and @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is expressed in units of the neutrino or photon temperature ) .",
    "there is a simple one  to  one correspondence between the masses of thermal wdm particles and sterile neutrinos for which the effect on the matter distribution and thus the transfer function for both models are identical  @xcite .",
    "writing equation  ( [ omegawdm ] ) in the two cases and equating @xmath33 and @xmath36 , one obtains @xmath38 in the following , we will thus consider only the thermal model and simply translate any mass limit into that for the sterile neutrinos using eq .",

    "let us now discuss briefly some simple scenarios .",
    "_ pure warm dark matter models_. in the case in which the universe contains only wdm ( in addition to the usual baryon , radiation and cosmological constant components ) , the transfer function can be approximated by the fitting function  @xcite @xmath39^{-5/\\nu } \\label{tshape}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , the scale of the break , is a function of the wdm parameters , while the index @xmath40 is fixed . with a boltzmann code simulation",
    "( using either cmbfast  @xcite or camb  @xcite ) , we find that @xmath41 is the best fit for @xmath42mpc@xmath43 and we obtain @xmath44 where the second line applies only to the case of thermal relics .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the results of the numerical simulations and compare them with our analytical fit .",
    "the power spectrum of the @xmath20wdm model differs from that of the corresponding @xmath20cdm model only at small scales .",
    "this is the reason why wdm has been suggested as a solution to the apparent `` crisis '' of cdm models on small scales .",
    "the matter density is fixed by the cmb and other data to @xmath45 . for pure @xmath20wdm models",
    "for which @xmath46 this gives @xmath47 .",
    "the particles therefore decouple extremely early in such a model .",
    "note that the light gravitino suggested by gauge mediated models of supersymmetry breaking decoupled when @xmath48 was much smaller , of the order of one hundred .    _ mixed models with cdm and gravitinos ( or any thermal relics with @xmath24 of a hundred)_. we will now consider the case of thermal relics which decoupled at a temperature when @xmath49 , as _",
    "e.g. _ the light gravitino , which is likely to be the lsp in gauge - mediated theories of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "note that @xmath49 corresponds to a decoupling temperature between a few gev and a few tev ( possibly much higher , depending on which theory is assumed beyond the standard model ) .",
    "note further that the temperature of thermal relics with @xmath49 is about a factor two smaller than that of ordinary neutrinos .",
    "they are thus not equivalent to hdm even in the small mass limit . for fixed @xmath48 ,",
    "both the density @xmath50 and the free - streaming wavenumber are proportional to the mass @xmath51 .",
    "taking @xmath52 , one gets @xmath53 in the absence of any cold dark matter , the preferred value @xmath54 would lead to a mass of order 100  ev and to a complete smoothing out of fluctuations for @xmath55 , at odds with the lyman-@xmath1 forest data ( and with various other constrains related to structure formation  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the presence of cdm , small  scale structures are not completely suppressed and the free - streaming effect leads to a step  like transfer function ( as for massive neutrinos , but with a step at a much smaller scale ) , while in the small @xmath51 limit standard @xmath20cdm is recovered . for a light gravitino in the the mass range @xmath56",

    "so , if the gravitino is the lsp , as suggested by gauge  mediated susy breaking scenarios , the susy breaking scale is limited from above , @xmath157 this conclusion is robust and relevant for supersymmetry searching at future accelerator machines as lhc . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that after decoupling the gravitino background was enhanced by the decay of the nsp ( next  to  lightest supersymmetric particle ) , as it happens in some scenarios @xcite , the total density of gravitinos as well as their velocity dispersion can only be enhanced , making the bound even stronger .",
    "the only possible way to evade this bound on the susy breaking scale ( still assuming that the gravitino is the lsp ) would be to assume some entropy production after gravitino decoupling , as suggested in refs .",
