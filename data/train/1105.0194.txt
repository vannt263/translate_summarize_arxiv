    "the spectral triple construction itself involves , a priori , only gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "+ a spectral triple @xmath0 is the central ingredient in a generalization of riemannian geometry known as noncommutative geometry .",
    "its constituents are a @xmath1-algebra @xmath2 represented as bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath3 together with an unbounded , self - adjoint operator @xmath4 called the dirac operator . for a commutative algebra the spectral",
    "triple is , under certain requirements @xcite , equivalent to a riemannian geometry on the state space of the algebra .",
    "the spectral triple which we investigate in this paper is a geometrical construction over a configuration space of connections .",
    "it is constructed over an infinite system of cubic lattices and the algebra is generated by loops running in these lattices .",
    "this algebra is inherently noncommutative .",
    "a copy of @xmath5 is assigned to each edge in these lattices - much alike lattice gauge theory - and with the refinement of lattices the number of copies of @xmath5 grows to infinity in a way which captures information of a configuration space of @xmath5 connections .",
    "this configuration space is related to canonical quantum gravity via ashtekar variables @xcite and the algebra of loop represent holonomy transforms of the ashtekar connection .",
    "the dirac type operator is then essentially given by a sum of dirac operators on these copies of @xmath5 .",
    "in @xcite it was proven that a semi - finite spectral triple emerge from these constituents , and in @xcite it was shown that the interaction between the algebra of loops and the dirac type operator reproduces the structure of the poisson bracket of general relativity formulated in terms of ashtekar variables .",
    "this means that the spectral triple encodes information of the kinematics of quantum gravity .",
    "the new insight presented in this paper is that a natural class of semi - classical states , labelled by a certain loop order , reside naturally in the hilbert space associated to the spectral triple . in @xcite",
    "the states at first loop order were identified and were shown to entail the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath6 dimensions in a semi - classical approximation .",
    "thus , these states were interpreted as one - particle states of a fermion in an ambient gravitational field dictated by the semi - classical approximation .",
    "correspondingly , in this paper we find that the @xmath7th order states entail , in a semi - classical approximation , a system of @xmath7 coupled fermions .",
    "in fact , we discuss two different types of semi - classical states . the first type , which we discuss in detail , give rise to a fermion interaction which involves flux tubes of the ashtekar connection",
    ". the second type of states does not give rise to this interaction .",
    "finally , in the limit where all gravitational degrees of freedom are turned off , a free fermionic quantum field theory emerges .",
    "the first type of states entail a certain _ twisted _ version of a free fermionic quantum field theory .",
    "the twist means that the inner product in what resembles a fock space involves a certain mixing of spinor degrees of freedom . if one restricts the construction to weyl spinors this feature is absent and the results is an ordinary free fermionic quantum field theory",
    "the second type of states which we discuss does not have this feature .",
    "the construction of the semi - classical states follows a certain logic which takes its point of departure in the choice of algebra : the choice of a noncommutative algebra of loops necessitates the addition of a matrix factor in the hilbert space to accommodate a representation of the algebra .",
    "also , the algebra of loops comes with a dependency on a choice of basepoint needed in order to define a product between loops . to free the construction from this basepoint dependency",
    "one is lead to consider a type of states which _ spread out the basepoint_. these states involve a certain matrix degree of freedom which will later merge into spinors .",
    "it is the additional matrix factor in the hilbert space which permit these matrices to appear .",
    "finally , the combination of these basepoint - independent states with coherent states over a classical point in the phase - space of gravity entails in a semi - classical approximation an infinite system of fermions which interact both among themselves and with the ambient gravitational fields given by the classical phase - space point .",
    "thus , there is a direct line of reason from the choice of a noncommutative algebra of holonomy loops ( as opposed , for example , to a commutative algebra of functions on the space of connections ) to the emergence of fermionic degrees of freedom . + the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly introduce elements of noncommutative geometry and its relation to the standard model . in section 3",
    "we introduce ashtekar variables together with their dual , holonomy loops and fluxes of triad fields . in section 4",
    "we then present the construction of the spectral triple .",
    "the triple is constructed first at the level of a single graph and second as a continuum limit over an infinite , countable set of embedded graphs . in section 5",
    "we comment on the poisson bracket of general relativity which is encoded in the spectral triple through the interaction between the dirac type operator and the algebra of loops .",
    "then , with the basic construction presented , we are in section 6 ready to address the question regarding the semi - classical approximation .",
    "we start the analysis by reviewing first the issue of a certain basepoint dependency of the spectral triple .",
    "the resolution of this problem leads directly to states which , in a semi - classical limit , entail the dirac hamiltonian of a single particle . in section 7 we then show that also higher order states reside within the spectral triple which , in a semi - classical approximation , leads to a system of interacting fermions .",
    "we show that in the special limit where all gravitational degrees of freedom are turned off , a fock space emerges . in section 8",
    "we give a conclusion .",
    "detailed computations are given in appendix a.",
    "noncommutative geometry is based on the insight , due to connes , that the metric on a compact riemannian manifold can be recovered from the dirac operator @xmath8 and its interaction with the algebra of smooth functions on the manifold @xcite .",
    "this means that the metric data is completely determined by the triple @xmath9 this result entails a natural generalization of riemannian geometry where one considers also noncommutative algebras .",
    "the central object in this generalization is the _ spectral triple _",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 is a not necessarily commutative @xmath12-algebra , @xmath3 is a hilbert space carrying a representation of @xmath11 and @xmath8 is an unbounded , self - adjoint operator called the dirac operator .",
    "such a triple is called spectral if it satisfies two conditions :    1 .",
    "the resolvent of @xmath4 , @xmath13 , is a compact operator in @xmath3 .",
    "the commutator @xmath14 $ ] is bounded for all elements @xmath15 .    a noncommutative geometry consist of a spectral triple which is required to satisfy an additional number of rules which generalize the interactions of the constituents in ( [ noet ] ) so that the construction coincides with riemannian geometry whenever @xmath11 is commutative .",
    "these rules strongly restrict the choice of the dirac operator @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that the standard model of particle physics coupled to the gravitational field provides an example of a noncommutative geometry . in this case",
    "the algebra is an _ almost commutative algebra _ of the form @xmath16 which interacts with a dirac operator that consist of two parts @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the standard dirac operator on the manifold @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a matrix valued function on @xmath19 which encodes the metric data of the states over @xmath21 .",
    "it was connes who realized that the entire structure of the standard model coupled to general relativity is encoded in a spectral triple that involve this algebra and dirac operator @xcite .",
    "in fact , the abstract requirements for the dirac operator , as mentioned above , entails that @xmath20 contains both the non - abelian gauge fields and the higgs field of the standard model together with their couplings to the elementary fermions .",
    "this very remarkable fact provides the higgs field with a geometrical interpretation as a carrier of metric information on a noncommutative space .",
    "furthermore , the action of the standard model coupled to the einstein hilbert action emerges from this spectral triple construction through the so - called spectral action principle @xcite which involves a heat - kernel expansion of the dirac operator @xmath22 .",
    "what emerges from this spectral triple construction is essentially the classical action .",
    "quantization of the fields of the standard model - barring the gravitational field - is applied _ after _ the heat kernel expansion .",
    "thus , the work of connes and chamseddine raises the question whether quantum theory should not play a more prominent role in this approach to high - energy physics .",
    "furthermore , since the construction of connes and chamseddine is fundamentally gravitational , one would expect that the answer to this question should , somehow , involve elements of quantum gravity .",
    "thus , one might speculate that the spectral triple construction due to connes should be interpreted as a low - energy limit of a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it was this line of reasoning that motivated the construction in @xcite of a semi - finite spectral triple over a configuration space of connections , see also @xcite .",
    "there , the idea is to use noncommutative geometry to identify a natural non - perturbative construction within the framework of canonical quantum gravity and then , subsequently , identify a semi - classical limit which coincides with known physics .",
    "ultimately , the goal is to make contact to connes work on the standard model .",
    "before we present the construction of this semi - finite spectral triple we will briefly review ashtekar variables and holonomy loops since these play a key role in the physical interpretation of the semi - finite spectral triple .",
    "let @xmath19 be a 4-dimensional globally hyperbolic manifold and consider a foliation of @xmath19 according to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a spatial manifold .",

    "this set of variables satisfy the poisson bracket @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the formulation of general relativity in terms of these variables involves an additional set of constraints , the gauss , the hamiltonian and the diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "for detail we refer to @xcite .",
    "the formulation of canonical gravity in terms of connection variables permits a shift to loop variables which are taken as the holonomy transform @xmath34 along a loop @xmath35 in @xmath24 . to define a conjugate variable to @xmath36",

    "the holonomy and flux variables in ( [ hoool ] ) and ( [ fluuux ] ) are taken as the basic variables in loop quantum gravity and will also play a key role in the following . here ,",
    "however , we shall restrict ourselves to a real @xmath5 connection , known as the ashtekar - barbero connection .",
    "this restriction corresponds either to a euclidian setting , in which the hamilton constraint remains its simple form , or , alternatively , to a lorentzian setting in which the hamilton constraint requires an additional term . for detail",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this section we outline the construction of the semi - finite spectral triple first presented in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "the construction of the dirac type operator follows @xcite .",
    "this spectral triple merges ideas and techniques of canonical gravity and noncommutative geometry .",
    "we first construct a spectral triple at the level of a finite graph .",
    "next we take the limit of such spectral triples , over an infinite system of ordered graphs , to obtain a limiting spectral triple .",
    "the spectral triple construction works with a compact group @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the construction does not a priori apply to the original ashtekar connection , which takes values in complexified @xmath5 , but rather to the ashtekar- barbero connection which takes values in @xmath5 .",
    "[ plaquet ]    let @xmath49 be a 3-dimensional , finite , cubic lattice .",

    "the edges in @xmath49 are oriented according to the three main directions in @xmath49 , the @xmath52- @xmath53- and @xmath54-directions , see figure 1 .",

    "thus , @xmath62 and the involution of a loop @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 in the following we shall discard trivial backtracking which means that we introduce the equivalence relation @xmath65 and let a loop @xmath66 be an equivalence class with respect hereto .    the product between two loops @xmath67 and @xmath68 is simply given by gluing the loops to form a new sequence of edges : @xmath69",
    "one easily checks that the involution equals the inverse which gives the set of loops in @xmath49 the structure of a group , known as the hoop group .",
    "finally , we consider finite series of loops @xmath70 with the involution @xmath71 and the product between @xmath72 and a second element @xmath73 @xmath74 the set of elements of the form ( [ form ] ) is a @xmath1-algebra denoted @xmath75 .      next ,",

    "this requirement is easily satisfied for the algebras and the hilbert spaces , see @xcite . for the dirac type operators the problem reduces to the simple case where an edge in @xmath100 is subdivided into two edges in @xmath99 , see figure 3.1",

    "it is now straight forward to write down a dirac operator on @xmath114 which is compatible with the projection ( [ proj2 ] ) .",
    "basically , we can pick any dirac operator of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a dirac operator on the copy of @xmath46 in @xmath114 whose coordinates are eliminated by the projection ( [ proj2 ] ) . at this point the choice of the operator @xmath116 is essentially unrestricted with @xmath72 being an arbitrary real parameter .",

    "@xmath123 denotes the corresponding differential .",
    "this line of analysis is straightforwardly generalized to repeated subdivisions . at the level of the @xmath7th subdivision of the edge",
    "the change of variables which generalizes ( [ change ] ) reads @xmath124 which corresponds to the structure maps @xmath125 again , it is straightforward to construct a dirac type operator compatible with these structure maps .",
    "this construction gives rise to a series of free parameters @xmath126 , one for each subdivision .",
    "thus , by solving the @xmath127 problem repeatedly , and by piecing together the different edges , we end up with a dirac type operator on the level of @xmath128 of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a dirac type operator corresponding to the @xmath121th level of subdivision in @xmath131 .",
    "the change of variables in ( [ genchange ] ) is the key step to construct @xmath132 .",

    "we shall ignore the correction terms @xmath167 when we apply relation ( [ xxx ] ) to translate quantized quantities involving the dirac type operator @xmath4 to their classical counterparts .",
    "the reason for this will become clear in the next section where we construct semi - classical states . these states have the property that any dependency on finite parts of the inductive system of lattices vanishes in a combined semi - classical limit continuum limit .    in the limit of repeated subdivision of lattices we find that the semi - finite spectral triple @xmath153 encodes information tantamount to a representation of the poisson bracket of general relativity .",

    "the semi - classical analysis starts with the realization that the spectral triple construction comes with a dependency on the choice of basepoint @xmath172 .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "had we instead chosen to work with traced holonomy loops this dependency would not show up since the basepoint dependency vanishes due to the cyclicity of the trace . in @xcite",

    "now , @xmath204 is a state in @xmath190 which does not show the dependency on the choice of basepoint @xmath195 mentioned above .",
    "this means that the expectation value of an element @xmath72 in @xmath205 on this state will depend only on the trace of @xmath72 @xmath206 and since the trace of an element of @xmath205 is basepoint independent , these states circumvent this problem .",
    "the strategy is to combine states of the form ( [ sss ] ) with a semi - classical approximation . to do this",
    "we need to introduce coherent states in @xmath134 .",
    "we first recall results for coherent states on various copies of @xmath5 .",
    "this construction uses results of hall @xcite and is inspired by the articles @xcite .",
    "first pick a point @xmath207 in the phase space of ashtekar variables connection . ] on a 3-manifold @xmath24 .",
    "the states which we construct will be coherent states peaked over this point .",
    "consider first a single edge @xmath164 and thus one copy of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath208 be a basis for @xmath209 .",
    "there exist families @xmath210 such that @xmath211 and @xmath212 where @xmath213 , and @xmath214 denotes the inner product hereon ; @xmath215 denotes the right endpoint of @xmath164 ( we assume that @xmath164 is oriented to the right ) , and the index `` @xmath216 '' in the @xmath217 refers to the direction of @xmath164 .",
    "the factor @xmath170 is due to the fact that @xmath218 corresponds to a flux operator with a surface determined by the lattice @xcite .",
    "corresponding statements hold for operators of the type @xmath219 where @xmath220 is a polynomial in three variables , and @xmath221 is a smooth function on @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath222 the states @xmath223 have further important physical properties which we are however not going to use at the present stage of the analysis . also , the precise construction of these states , in particular the choice of complexifier @xcite , is irrelevant for the results presented in this paper .    let us now consider the graph @xmath142 .",
    "we split the edges into @xmath224 , and @xmath225 , where @xmath226 denotes the edges appearing in the @xmath7th subdivision but not in the @xmath227th subdivision , and @xmath228 the rest .",
    "let @xmath223 be the coherent state on @xmath5 defined above and define the states @xmath229 by @xmath230 and @xmath231 finally define @xmath232 to be the product of all these states as a state in @xmath233 .",
    "these states are essentially identical to the states constructed in @xcite except that they are based on cubic lattices and a particular mode of subdivision .    in the limit",
    "@xmath234 these states produce the right expectation value on all loop operators in the infinite lattice .",
    "the reason for the split of edges in @xmath164 and @xmath235 in the definition of the coherent state is to pick up only those degrees of freedom which live in the continuum limit @xmath234 . in this way we shall , once the continuum limit is taken , partially have eliminated dependencies on finite parts of the lattices . in a classical setup",
    ", this amounts to information which has measure zero in a riemann integral .",
    "we are now ready to combine the content of the previous two subsections .",
    "consider first the states @xmath236 composed by the states ( [ sss ] ) and the coherent states introduced in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict the series @xmath237 of parameters in @xmath4 : we now require all @xmath238 s associated to edges appearing in the @xmath239th subdivision but not in the @xmath240th subdivision to be equal . with this restriction",
    "the parameters @xmath238 represent a scaling degree of freedom .",
    "we find @xmath241 where @xmath192 and @xmath242 denote start and endpoint of an edge @xmath164 and where the sum runs over edges appearing in the @xmath7th but not in the @xmath227th subdivision .",
    "the evaluation over coherent states has been performed , see equation ( [ jp1 ] ) and ( [ jp2 ] ) , and therefore @xmath217 appears in ( [ hmmmmm ] ) where the index @xmath216 refers to the direction of the edge @xmath164 . expand @xmath243 according to @xmath244 where `` @xmath216 '' is again the direction of the edge @xmath164 .",
    "this expansion is permitted whenever we apply the coherent states and take the continuum limit @xmath234 together with the semi - classical limit @xmath245 .",
    "the term @xmath246 , in the combined semi - classical and continuum limit , give a covariant derivative @xmath247 where @xmath216 denotes the direction of the edge @xmath164 and where @xmath248 $ ] is the covariant derivative .",
    "finally , from equation ( [ hmmmmm ] ) we obtain the limit @xmath249 provided we set @xmath250 and fix the parameters @xmath155 to @xmath251 .",
    "thus , the expectation value of the dirac type operator @xmath4 on the states ( [ dadada ] ) renders , in a combined semi - classical and continuum limit , the expectation value of an ordinary spatial dirac operator on a manifold @xmath24 , on the condition that we fix the free parameters @xmath252 which appear in @xmath4 .",
    "the spinor degrees of freedom emerged from the matrix factor which was introduced in the hilbert space @xmath134 in order to accommodate a representation of the algebra of loops .    in the computation leading to ( [ hmmm ] ) it is crucial that the terms from ( [ zeroth ] ) at zeroth order in @xmath253 cancel out .",
    "if they had failed to do so the result would be terms which diverge in the continuum limit .",
    "this issue becomes particularly urgent when we in the next section consider many - particle states .",
    "there the grading of certain paths will give rise to signs which jeopardize this cancellation of zero order terms and forces us to impose certain conventions , see the paragraph after ( [ supermann ] ) .    the expression ( [ hmmm ] )",
    "is formulated with respect to a certain coordinate system which emerges from the graphs @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the cubic lattices can , in this specific limit , be interpreted as an emergent coordinate system .",
    "in particular , this coordinate system is exactly the coordinate system in which the classical ashtekar variables are formulated .",
    "notice that in order to obtain expression ( [ hmmm ] ) we had to fix the parameter @xmath252 .",
    "thus , the freedom which we encountered when we constructed the dirac type operator @xmath4 is eliminated in order to obtain a sensible semi - classical limit .",
    "notice also that @xmath217 is the densitized dreibein @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the dreibein and @xmath256 is the determinant of the 3-metric @xmath256 given by the dreibein .",
    "this means that the inverse measure @xmath257 appear naturally in ( [ hmmm ] ) .",
    "however , a problem regarding the normalization of spinors does arise in this framework , see @xcite .      in order to obtain the dirac hamiltonian instead of the dirac operator in ( [ hmmm ] )",
    "we must introduce additional degrees of freedom which , in the appropriate limit , can correspond to the lapse and shift fields .",
    "this will then encode what amounts to a choice of foliation of space - time .",
    "these degrees of freedom are , seen from the spectral triple construction , related to the relationship between the clifford algebra and the matrix factor in @xmath134 .",
    "there are alternative ways to introduce these additional degrees of freedom , see @xcite , and at present it is not clear which approach is more natural . for instance , following @xcite    we can introduce a modification of the dirac operator ( [ general ] ) with a matrix factor associated to each edge , written @xmath258 where @xmath259 is an arbitrary , self - adjoint two - by - two matrix associated to the edge @xmath164 . in the sum in ( [ modifications ] ) @xmath239 runs over the different copies of the group according to the change of variables introduced in section ( 4.4 ) and @xmath72 is an @xmath5 index .",
    "one finds that the expectation value of @xmath260 on the states ( [ dadada ] ) gives @xmath261 where we wrote @xmath259 as @xmath262 with @xmath263 referring to the point which @xmath164 singles out in this limit . here ,",
    "@xmath264 and @xmath265 are seen to give the lapse and shift fields . in ( [ hmmmdi ] )",
    "we have omitted certain zero - order terms and equation ( [ hmmmdi ] ) is therefore seen to equal the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "thus , the states ( [ dadada ] ) can be interpreted as one - particle states on which the dirac type operator @xmath260 gives the hamiltonian in the semi - classical approximation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this interpretation .",
    "in the states ( [ sss ] ) the sum runs over parallel transports which start at the basepoint , travels up to a spinor degree of freedom ( the matrix factor @xmath196 ) at a vertex , and then back to the basepoint .",
    "the parallel transport going up to the spinor utilizes the operators @xmath186 whereas the parallel transport going back uses the operators @xmath184 , see ( [ twooperators ] ) .",
    "the two path _ up _ and _ down _ are in ( [ sss ] ) taken to be identical , but one could also permit different paths .",
    "thus , the spinor degrees of freedom arise together with a loop composed of @xmath186 and @xmath184 operators and is located at the point where these are joined . in this section",
    "we analyze objects in @xmath134 which involves _ products _ of loops composed of @xmath186 s and @xmath184 s .",
    "each of these loops carry spinor degrees of freedom , and thus the number of spinor degrees of freedom will grow together with the number of loop factors .",
    "these loop objects will be seen to form a system of many - particle states in the semi - classical continuum limit .",
    "we start the analysis by constructing states which are build from @xmath266 and the coherent states @xmath232 .",
    "thus , we write down the anti - symmetrized state @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the group of @xmath216 permutations and where `` grad@xmath269 '' means that we only allow terms in this sum which involve at most one path @xmath270 which is odd with respect to the clifford algebra . furthermore , we shall restrict the choice of paths @xmath194 in ( [ supermann ] ) so that the operator @xmath271 , which corresponds to the intersection @xmath272 between two paths , is even with respect to the clifford algebra for all paths in the sum in ( [ supermann ] ) .",
    "these restriction appears to be rather unnatural but will play a central role in the following analysis .",
    "we shall comment on this below .",
    "before we continue let us comment briefly on the structure of ( [ supermann ] ) .",
    "when we construct states in @xmath134 which we wish to assign the prefix `` physical '' then gauge invariance must be taken into consideration . a priori ,",
    "it is not obvious how one should define an action of the gauge group to the matrix factor in @xmath134  and thereby to the spinor degrees of freedom which turn up in ( [ supermann ] )  but in the continuum and semi - classical limit one must demand that only terms which are gauge covariant and invariant emerge ( in this limit one can define the ordinary gauge transformation for the spinors , but it will not define an action of the gauge group on @xmath134 ) . therefore , physical states can only involve loops .",
    "this is why loops , build of @xmath184 s and @xmath186 s , are natural object to consider .",
    "we now proceed to compute both the inner product and the expectation value of @xmath4 on such states in the semi - classical approximation . in the following we",
    "shall not be concerned with the lapse and shift fields and therefore only work with the dirac type operator @xmath4 ( and not @xmath260 ) .",
    "consider the case @xmath273 @xmath274 a long and tedious computation , which is carried out in appendix a , gives first @xmath275 the first two terms in ( [ herefirst ] ) are identical to expressions one would obtain from the one - particle sectors of @xmath276 and @xmath277 respectively .",
    "the last term , however , is a `` cross - term '' which involves parallel transports @xmath184 s . if we take the combined semi - classical and continuum limit of the last term we find @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the parallel transport between points @xmath263 and @xmath280 in the continuum lattice , given by the composition of parallel transports @xmath281 s .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit we find terms where two fermions are connected by a gravitational flux tube . in the definition ( [ sss ] ) of @xmath282",
    "we could have included a normalized sum over paths connecting the basepoint with each matrix @xmath196 . in that case @xmath283 in ( [ interactionterm ] ) would involve a sum over paths connecting @xmath263 and @xmath280 and thus the interaction terms would involve several flux tubes .",
    "notice also that although all @xmath284 s start at the basepoint the composition @xmath283 does not necessarily run through the basepoint : two parallel transports @xmath281 and @xmath285 may have an overlap , @xmath286 , so that their composition @xmath287 will only be connected to the basepoint through a trivial backtracking which cancels out .",
    "the computation of ( [ herefirst ] ) depends crucially on the presence of the clifford algebra elements in @xmath186 and the fact that conjugation with @xmath186 corresponds to a trace over the matrices , see ( [ trace ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath288 in ( [ herefirst ] ) comes from a trace over @xmath289 that emerge from a conjugation with @xmath186 , as shown in appendix a.    finally , in the particular limit where we let the coherent states @xmath290 be peaked over the classical phase space point which corresponds to a flat space - time with @xmath291 , then this expression gives @xmath292 ignoring the factor @xmath288",
    "this term resemble a cross term coming from an anti - symmetrized fock space .",
    "however , such a term would be of the form @xmath293 and we see that the difference is the occurrence of an additional trace .",
    "this means that the cross - term term ( [ interactiontermdada ] ) can , in the flat - space limit , almost be interpreted in terms of anti - symmetrization of a fermionic fock space , except that an odd mixing of spinor degrees of freedom happen due to the missing trace in ( [ flatspacelimit ] ) .",
    "we shall further analyze this issue in section [ analize ] .",
    "let us now work out the expectation value of the dirac type operator @xmath4 on the states ( [ supermann ] ) .",
    "again , the computations are given in appendix a. first , we find @xmath294 where expressions like @xmath295 ( sum over @xmath72 ) refer again to an edge which starts where @xmath285 ends and which has the matrix @xmath296 associated to its endpoint , with the direction of the edge denoted by @xmath216.    the computation of ( [ herefirst ] ) and ( [ here ] ) , which is found in appendix a ( see ( [ udregning ] ) ) , is highly sign sensitive .",
    "the special conventions which we introduced with ( [ supermann ] ) , where we permit only one odd @xmath186 in the product , and where we permit only even intersections of the paths @xmath194 , are crucial for the result ( [ here ] ) . had we not introduced these conventions we would not , in all terms , have obtained the right sign which gives the derivative .",
    "instead terms would arise from ( [ udregning ] ) which would diverge in the semi - classical continuum limit because they would not involve a @xmath297 factor .    the first two terms in ( [ here ] )",
    "are terms which give the one - particle hamiltonians in the semi - classical limit for the spinors @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the computation of the one - particle sector was worked out in the previous section .",
    "the last four terms look like an interaction between particles @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "if we take the continuum and semi - classical limit of these last terms , we find @xmath298 where @xmath279 is the parallel transport between points @xmath263 and @xmath280 in the continuum lattice , given by the composition of parallel transports @xmath281 s .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit we find interaction terms where two fermions interact locally with a non - local gravitational flux tube .",
    "finally , we again consider the particular limit where the coherent states @xmath290 are peaked over the classical phase space point which corresponds to a flat space - time with @xmath291 and @xmath299 , then this expression gives @xmath300 the previous discussion regarding similarities with a free fermionic quantum field theory also applies here .",
    "we will further analyze these terms in the next section .",
    "let us examine the terms in ( [ sara ] ) and ( [ flatspacelimit ] ) which emerge in the limit where we approximate the construction around a flat space - time geometry . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider terms without the derivative , thus coming from ( [ sara ] ) .",
    "these terms have the form @xmath301 where @xmath302 and @xmath303 are fields which takes value in two - by - two matrices and which should be interpreted as spinor fields .",
    "if we rewrite this expression in terms of weyl spinors @xmath304 where @xmath305 are the columns in @xmath306 and @xmath307 which represent weyl components , then ( [ flatspacelimit2 ] ) becomes @xmath308 on the other hand , consider the case where @xmath307 and @xmath306 appear in a two - particle state in a fermionic fock space and consider in particular the terms coming from the anti - symmetrization of this state : @xmath309 the two expressions ( [ oddterms ] ) and ( [ antisymmm ] ) are very similar , their difference being an odd mixing of weyl components in the last two terms of ( [ oddterms ] ) an the absence in ( [ oddterms ] ) of the last term in ( [ antisymmm ] ) .",
    "the mixing of weyl components in ( [ oddterms ] ) appears to be unphysical , but one notices that if we restrict our construction to describe weyl spinors only ( thus , letting one of each columns in ( [ expand ] ) be zero ) , then ( [ oddterms ] ) and ( [ antisymmm ] ) coincide .",
    "the result is then , due to anti - symmetrization , that the entire two - particle sector obtains an overall factor which will be killed by the normalization .",
    "this feature generalizes to many - particle states .",
    "therefore we conclude that    1 .",
    "the construction coincides with a free fermionic quantum field theory in the flat - space limit if one restricts it to involve only weyl spinors , and 2 .   when we consider four - spinors an odd mixing of weyl components appear .",
    "the restriction to weyl spinors does not appear very natural .",
    "rather , we suspect that additional structure should be introduced to the construction which causes ( [ oddterms ] ) and ( [ antisymmm ] ) to be equal .",
    "further , one might speculate whether this is related to the fact that we are working with @xmath5 connections and not with complexified @xmath5 connections , the latter being the original ashtekar connection . in @xcite",
    "we have already proposed the idea that complexified @xmath5 connections may be introduced in our framework via a doubling of the hilbert space together with the introduction of a real structure related to a reality condition .",
    "it may be that such an extension  implemented in a natural way  will cause equation ( [ oddterms ] ) and ( [ antisymmm ] ) to be equal .",
    "if this is possible one might even wonder if the anti - symmetrization in ( [ supermann ] ) is necessary : possible the cross terms of the form ( [ interactionterm ] ) will descent , in the flat space - time limit , to terms which amounts to a anti - symmetrization .",
    "the computations of sectors which involve more than two particles are very similar to the computations from the two - particle sector .",
    "some details are given in appendix a.6 .",
    "in general , what we find is that the continuum semi - classical limit of the expectation value of an @xmath7-particle state will , in addition to the @xmath7-particle sector also give all the @xmath310-sectors ( @xmath311 ) and will involve pairs of fermions connected by one flux tubes , see equation ( [ fluuuux ] ) .",
    "again , in the flat space - time limit we find that by restricting the construction to weyl spinors we obtain what amounts to a @xmath7-particle sector coming from an anti - symmetric fock - space .      from the computation of the expectation value of @xmath22 on the states ( [ supermann ] )",
    "one is lead to consider whether other types of many - particle states can be found in @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , with the infinite dimensional clifford bundle in @xmath134 there is some room to play in . in the following",
    "we shall discuss one possibility .",
    "consider the two loops in @xmath142 where one is build out of @xmath312 s except for one edge , and the other is build entirely from @xmath312 s .",
    "both loops have a matrix degree of freedom @xmath306 inserted : @xmath313 so that the composition @xmath314 form a based loop in @xmath205 and where @xmath192 and @xmath242 are the vertices where @xmath164 starts and ends respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath315 involves a loop build out of @xmath312 s and with a single `` hole '' , and @xmath316 involves the same loop , but without the hole .",
    "if we take the expectation of @xmath22 on the sum @xmath317 we get again the basic building block of a spatial dirac operator , corresponding to one of the term in ( [ hmmmmm ] ) .",
    "thus , with a sum over different loops we can again recover expressions like ( [ hmmm ] ) and ( [ hmmmdi ] ) .",
    "the difference between this line of construction and what we did in the previous sections appears when we proceed to construct also many - particle states .",
    "either we do so by permitting products of loops , or we consider loops with more than one hole . in any case , the presence of @xmath186 s `` on both sides of '' @xmath196 in ( [ elementofcrime ] ) has the effect that the parallel transports in ( [ interactiontermdada ] ) and ( [ interactionterm ] ) is absent and that instead a double trace appears .",
    "thus , the whole issue with mixing of different weyl spinor components disappear with this alternative construction .",
    "therefore , with this approach it is possible to work with 4-spinors .",
    "thus , we find that there are at least two types of semi - classical states : the ones discussed in the previous sections , see ( [ supermann ] ) , which entail a fermion interaction with gravitational flux tubes , and the ones described in this section , see ( [ elementofcrime ] ) , which come without this fermion interaction . also , if we permit in ( [ supermann ] ) a normalized sum over several paths connecting the matrix @xmath196 with the basepoint , then the result will be a fermion interaction which involves more than one gravitational flux tube .",
    "whenever flux tubes are present an odd mixing of weyl components appear in the flat space - time limit , a feature which is not present if we restrict the construction to weyl spinors .",
    "note also that the states ( [ supermann ] ) and products of states ( [ elementofcrime ] ) will span the same hilbert space .",
    "the difference between the two types of states is solely the way the matrices @xmath196 are inserted .",
    "further analysis is needed to understand better the form of these semi - classical states .",
    "it seems clear , however , that the hilbert space @xmath134 should only be regarded as an intermediate structure which we for now use to construct the spectral triple .",
    "a more appropriate hilbert space should most likely be found in the continuum limit as the hilbert space spanned by states of the form ( [ supermann ] ) ( probably with both symmetric and anti - symmetric sectors ) .",
    "one might speculate whether we are in fact recovering a gns construction around the semi - classical states @xmath318 .",
    "the key new insight presented in this paper is that central elements of fermionic quantum field theory can be _ derived _ from canonical quantum gravity in a semi - classical approximation by utilizing elements of noncommutative geometry .    specifically , we show that an infinite system of interacting fermions emerges in a semi - classical approximation from a previously constructed semi - finite spectral triple over holonomy loops .",
    "further , when all gravitational degrees of freedom are turned off a free fermionic quantum field theory emerge . this result is a strong indication that this model should be interpreted as describing quantized gravitational fields coupled to quantized matter fields .",
    "it is important to realize that the spectral triple construction does , a priori , only involve gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , matter degrees of freedom are , to some extend , emergent and canonical .",
    "a further indication that this model describes quantized gravitational fields is that it encodes the kinematics of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this should be understood in the sense that the interaction between the algebra of holonomy loops and the dirac type operator reproduces the structure of the poisson bracket of general relativity formulated in terms of ashtekar variables @xcite .",
    "thus , the spectral triple is essentially a rearrangement of canonical quantum gravity cast in terms of ashtekar variables .",
    "this paper is a continuation of a series of papers @xcite devoted to the study of the semi - classical analysis of the spectral triple construction . here ,",
    "semi - classical refer to the gravitational fields and is computed in orders of the planck length . in @xcite semi - classical states",
    "were constructed which , in a semi - classical approximation , entails the dirac hamiltonian in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "thus , these states were interpreted as one - fermion states in a given foliation and a given background gravitational field . in this paper",
    "we recognize that these one - fermion states are the simplest examples of a much larger class of states which are labelled by a certain loop order .",
    "the one - particle states found in @xcite lie in the first order sector . at @xmath7th order the states entail , in a semi - classical approximation , a system of @xmath7 interacting fermions .",
    "depending on the exact way these states are constructed they may come with an interaction which involves flux - tubes of the ashtekar connection .",
    "these flux tubes connect fermion degrees of freedom located at different points in space .",
    "furthermore , we find that in the additional limit where all gravitational degrees of freedom are turned off a free fermionic quantum field theory emerge . again , depending on the exact way the semi - classical states are constructed this free theory may involve a certain mixing of different spinor degrees of freedom .",
    "this mixing can be circumvented by restricting to weyl spiors .",
    "+ these new results raise many questions .",
    "first , one should clarify what happens to the free quantum field theory when one perturbs the background around the flat - space limit .",
    "the interesting question is what kind of interaction will emerge .",
    "one might speculate whether it will fall within the setup of an interacting quantum field theory . on a similar note",
    ", one should also analyze how the quantum corrections - which goes beyond the semi - classical approximation - will affect the free theory . again",
    ", what interactions will arise ?",
    "will they be local and will they fall within the setup of an interacting quantum field theory ?    also , one need to determine whether the fermionic interaction which emerges from the semi - classical states is plausible as a physical interaction , just as one should aim to understand better the particular mixing of different weyl components which comes from this interaction .",
    "the restriction to weyl spinors which we identify as a possible way to circumvent this mixing does not appear natural .",
    "rather , it seems that additional structure should be introduced to remedy this problem .",
    "the computations leading to the many - particle sectors are highly sign - sensitive and depend on a complicated system of gradings related to lengths of paths . in fact",
    ", the final result relies on an apparently ad - hoc convention which eliminates alternating sign factors which would otherwise cause the result to diverge .",
    "therefore , the sign - sensitivity does not appear natural and one might speculate whether some additional grading  for instance in the form of a real structure  could change this . furthermore , the issue concerning the normalization of spinors discussed in @xcite is still unresolved and requires attention .",
    "the semi - classical analysis presented in this paper operates with a double limit : first a semi - classical limit is taken at a finite level of discretization whereupon a continuum limit is taken . at the present level of analysis",
    "it is not known whether the continuum limit can be taken without the semi - classical approximation and what constraints such a limit might entail .",
    "this issue is likely to be related to that of diffeomorphisms . where the spectral triple construction does not possess an apparent action of the diffeomorphism group the hamiltonians which we obtain in the semi - classical continuum limit are invariant .",
    "thus , diffeomorphisms turn up in the combined semi - classical continuum limit and it is therefore an interesting question what role they will play if one takes the continuum limit alone .",
    "further , it is important to note that the semi - classical approximation discussed in this paper is with respect to the planck length @xmath319 and is a semi - classical limit of quantized gravitational fields . when elements of quantum field theory emerge in this limit",
    "the question arises how @xmath320 might emerge from the construction .",
    "we suspect that this issue is related to the issue with the double limits .",
    "the semi - classical states have a very particular form .",
    "they involve a sum over holonomy loops composed of two different kinds of parallel transports : one is the ordinary one , the other involves also elements of the infinite dimensional clifford algebra associated to the spectral triple construction .",
    "the latter resembles an @xmath7-form ( at a finite level ) and one might wonder what geometrical significance these states have , in relation to the spectral triple construction . furthermore , spinor degrees of freedom appear through an insertion of matrices in these loops .",
    "these insertions appears somewhat arbitrary and one might wonder whether a guiding principle exist . also , in the construction of the semi - classical states we imposed an anti - symmetrization .",
    "a priori there will also be a symmetric sector in the hilbert space .",
    "whether this sector could somehow be related to bosonic degrees of freedom is an interesting question .",
    "the spectral triple construction works for a compact lie group , which we set equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the ashtekar connection , however , is in its original form a _ complexified _",
    "@xmath5 connection , corresponding to @xmath321 , which is non - compact .",
    "a choice of an @xmath5 connection corresponds either to a euclidean setting or to a formulation where the hamilton acquires an additional term . clearly , it is desirable to extend the spectral triple construction to the complexified group and because we operate with a particular continuum limit which favors infinitesimal edges",
    ", we believe this might be done by doubling the hilbert space and introducing a real structure .",
    "another interesting issue is the appearance of the lapse and shift fields in the construction .",
    "so far we have found several ways to introduce these fields via matrices associated to edges in the infinite lattice .",
    "it is , however , essential to understand what geometrical role  in terms of the spectral triple construction ",
    "these degrees of freedom play .",
    "if this is understood one might be lead to a natural formulation of a wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "indeed , despite the advances made in this paper it should be stressed that the hilbert space in the spectral triple construction can only be regarded as a kinematical hilbert space . so far",
    "no wheeler - dewitt constraint has been constructed nor implemented .",
    "thus , the analysis carried out in this paper should be interpreted as dealing with a fermionic sector in a larger yet to be understood framework which involves also a purely gravitational sector . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will make a first step as to how such a gravitational sector can be found within this spectral triple framework .",

    "also , we would like to thank fedele lizzi and patrizia vitale for hospitality and fruitful discussions during a visit .",
    "in this appendix we give first the computations concerning the properties of the operators @xmath186 introduced in section [ dependency ] .",
    "the bulk of this appendix gives the computations leading to the results ( [ herefirst ] ) and ( [ here ] ) in section [ many ] .",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath322 this convention is realized by @xmath323 with this realization we have @xmath324 we begin by defining : @xmath325 the relationship between @xmath326 and @xmath181 ( which we introduce in section [ dependency ] ) is simply @xmath327 .",
    "we introduce here @xmath326 in order to keep the subsequent computations simpler .",
    "notice that @xmath326 is unitary since @xmath328 next we compute for @xmath329 that @xmath330 since writing @xmath331 and seeing that @xmath332 we will now make the additional convention @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "the form of @xmath326 then reads @xmath335 where the sum now runs over @xmath336 , and we furthermore have @xmath337 where @xmath338 is diagonal @xmath339",
    ".      we will demonstrate the basic trick for the computations we are going to do , by first computing the example @xmath340 we note , that @xmath341 is sandwiched between @xmath342 and @xmath343 .",
    "we write @xmath344 using ( [ spor ] ) we get @xmath345 we next write @xmath346 where we are summing over @xmath72 and @xmath347 means the @xmath348-component of @xmath349 . since @xmath350 we will also write @xmath351 continuing the computation we get @xmath352 all together we get @xmath353 what is fundamental in this computation is the following ( which we will use subsequently ) : we want to compute a term of the form @xmath354 where @xmath355 are almost general elements ( see below ) in @xmath356 .",
    "we can compute this as @xmath357 where @xmath358 is the sign we pick up by commuting the clifford part of @xmath359 past the clifford part of @xmath360 , i.e. @xmath361 is the clifford degree of @xmath362 multiplied with the clifford degree of @xmath360 .",
    "that @xmath355 are almost general means , that they do nt have any clifford elements in common with @xmath363 and @xmath343 , and that @xmath364 do nt have any clifford elements in common .",
    "we can also remark , that if we replace @xmath362 with @xmath365 , then , since we are taking the @xmath366 in the computation , we can compute @xmath367 where we are picking up an extra sign , from commuting the clifford part of @xmath368 with the clifford part of @xmath369 .            to compute the terms ( [ skidt ] ) , we first write @xmath375 to proceed we note that @xmath376 .",
    "we write @xmath377 where @xmath378 is @xmath379 minus the last edge . with this notation",
    "we get @xmath380 we are therefore left with computing terms of the form @xmath381 these can be computed in the following way : @xmath382 thus , plugging in , we finally get @xmath383 notice here the factor @xmath384 appearing in the denominator of ( [ skidtpar ] ) . thus , when @xmath385 ( the continuum limit ) these terms vanish .",
    "this is very fortunate since such terms would not fit with the results of our computations .",
    "the corresponding terms for the dirac operator @xmath4 , which we need to compute , are roughly of the form @xmath386 of course either @xmath387 or @xmath379 need be one edge shorter on one of the sides in order give something different from zero , and we also need to multiply with hall coherent states , but we will omit this in the notation here .",
    "for the computation of ( [ ddiagonal ] ) let us first compute the term @xmath388 this only gives something , for the term of the form in @xmath4 which include @xmath389 .",
    "multiplying @xmath389 on @xmath326 and remembering that we are taking the trace at the end , gives @xmath390 .",
    "we therefore get @xmath391 here we have been sloppy with the notation , and omitting the prefactor @xmath392 .",
    "@xmath393 denotes the expectation value of @xmath394 on semi - classical states , see ( [ jp1 ] ) .",
    "similarly for ( [ ikkeddiagonal ] ) we get the terms ( right hand side indicating where the @xmath399 has been inserted ) @xmath400\\\\   & ( -1)^{n_2+n_3+n_1n_2+n_1n_3+n_2n_3 } tr(a^*\\mathrm{i}e_a^j\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2 }   \\sigma^a cb^*d   ) & \\big [ a^*\\cu_j^*\\cu_{p_2}^ *   \\label{id2}\\big]\\\\   & ( -1)^{n_2+n_3+n_1n_2+n_1n_3+n_2n_3 } tr(a^ * cb^ * \\mathrm{i}e_a^j\\frac{-\\mathrm{i}}{2 } \\sigma^a d   ) & \\big [ \\cu_{p_3}\\cu_j d   \\label{id3 } \\big]\\\\   & ( -1)^{n_1+n_3+n_1n_2+n_1n_3+n_2n_3 } tr(a^ * cb^ * \\mathrm{i}e_a^j\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2 } \\sigma^a d   ) & \\big [ b^*\\cu_j^ * \\cu_{p_3}^*\\big]\\;. \\label{id4 } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly we could write the terms of the type ( [ skidtd ] ) . however in the continuum limit",
    "these terms will vanish , due to the powers of @xmath401 appearing in these terms .      in order to keep the notation in the above calculations simple ,",
    "we have done the entire computations with @xmath326 and not @xmath327 .",
    "the computations with @xmath403 instead of @xmath326 can be done similarly .",
    "the results ( [ diares ] ) , ( [ ikkediares ] ) , ( [ d1],[d2],[d3],[d4 ] ) , and ( [ id1],[id2],[id3],[id1 ] ) remain the same .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath256 s always cancels out with the @xmath404 s .",
    "the results ( [ skidtpar ] ) basically remain the same , however the matrices @xmath405 will be multiplied by suitable @xmath256es , or traces thereof .",
    "the powers of @xmath401 remain the same , and the terms will therefore vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "we will now apply the computation to the two particle states @xmath406 we have here omitted the prefactor and the hall s coherent state in the notation .",
    "also , we will give the computations for combinations of @xmath186 s with arbitrary gradings , and thus not invoke the convention introduced in ( [ supermann ] ) that at most one @xmath186 can be odd with respect to the clifford algebra .",
    "the reason for this is that we wish to display the sign - sensititity of these computations .",
    "finally , note that we have not antisymmetrized the expression ( [ exxxxx ] ) .",
    "instead we compute the inner product with a term of the form @xmath407 we see that three types of terms can arise in the inner product : @xmath408 according to ( [ diares ] ) , the terms ( [ diacont ] ) gives @xmath409 according to ( [ ikkediares ] ) , the terms ( [ offdiacont ] ) gives @xmath410 where @xmath7 denotes the lenght of the path @xmath411 and @xmath194 have in common , @xmath412 the length of @xmath411 minus @xmath7 and @xmath413 the length of @xmath194 minus @xmath7 .",
    "we will now compute the terms ( [ ddiagonal ] ) , ( [ ikkeddiagonal ] ) and ( [ skidtd ] ) for the two particle states . again",
    "each of these terms basically constists of 4 terms , in the case ( [ ddiagonal ] ) these terms are @xmath414 where the @xmath415 denotes going one edge further than @xmath194 , and @xmath242 denotes the endpoint of this edge .",
    "the terms give @xmath416 where we have the same conventions for @xmath417 like in the computation of the inner product of the two particle state , and where @xmath418 means the copy of @xmath46 associated to the @xmath415-edge .",
    "the computations for many particles reduces to the problem of computing terms of the form @xmath421 where @xmath422 is a permutation of @xmath423 .",
    "the computations can be done similar to those of the two particle states .",
    "one starts by finding the first @xmath424 in @xmath425 one then moves the expression , which is sandwiched between @xmath424 and @xmath426 to the first @xmath427 appearing in @xmath428 and cancels out @xmath429 with @xmath430 , and @xmath424 with @xmath426 .",
    "one is now left with a nested expression of the same sort as one started with .",
    "one can therefore continue the procedure until all the @xmath431 s have been cancelled .",
    "eventually , one will end up with terms , which are products of @xmath432 and of course a prefactor , which is a power of @xmath401 and a sign .",
