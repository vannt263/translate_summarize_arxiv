    "the behavior of the kaon electromagnetic form factor is less certain both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the kaon is composed by two quarks with different quark masses , therefore it becomes a little more complicated to obtain its lc wave functions and to compute its electromagnetic form factor .",
    "for example , the kaon electromagnetic form factor has been studied in refs.@xcite in the light - cone quark model only within the soft region . here",
    "we shall present a systematical study on the charged / neutral kaon electromagnetic form factors in the intermediate and large energy region within the @xmath1 factorization formalism by properly taking the @xmath10 breaking effects into account .",

    "another important power correction is from the higher twist structures in the kaon da .",
    "the end - point singularity becomes more serious for the higher twist structures , because the asymptotic behavior of the twist-3 das , especially @xmath64 , so the calculations for these higher twist contributions have more uncertainty than that for the leading twist .",
    "it means that one should use the twist-3 wave function with a better behavior in the end - point region than that of the asymptotic one so as to give a more reliable estimation of the higher twist structures contribution .",
    "the brodsky - huang - lepage ( bhl ) prescription provides a useful way to construct a wave function with better end - point behavior @xcite , we shall adopt it to construct the kaon lc wave functions for the present purpose , and then we discuss its uncertainty for the kaon electromagnetic form factor .",
