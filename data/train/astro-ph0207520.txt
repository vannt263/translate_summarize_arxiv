    "* ) , thus dark halos can produce the significant amount of multiple images even at @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "the distribution of image separations , however , clearly indicates that the use of only dark matter properties can not match observations .",
    "that is , the observed distribution of image separations is never reproduced from the theoretical calculation using the mass function of dark halos and only one population for lensing objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the possible solution to explain the distribution of image separations is the modification of inner structure of dark halos by introducing baryonic cooling @xcite . in this picture , inside low mass halos baryons are efficiently compressed and form sufficiently concentrated galaxies , while inside larger halos such as group- or cluster - mass halos global baryon cooling hardly occurs and thus the inner structure of dark halos remains unmodified .",
    "then a question comes to our mind : _ what is the fraction of dark halo lenses ?",
    "_ here the term `` dark halo lenses '' is used to describe lenses which are produced by the gravitational potential of dark halos . in other words ,",
    "the lens objects of dark halo lenses are dark halos which have no central galaxies or have central galaxies but they are too small to dominate in gravitational lensing .",
    "dark halo lenses exhibit characteristic properties such as the small flux ratios and the detectable odd images @xcite , thus can be distinguished from usual galaxy lenses . since dark halos are expected to have a steep central cusp , the significant amount of dark halo lenses should be observed .",
    "but so far no confirmed dark halo lens system is observed in strong gravitational lensing survey .",
    "the exception is arc statistics in rich clusters @xcite , but the known cluster lenses were all found by searching for lenses in detail after identifying a rich cluster . in the surveys which first identify source objects and see whether they are lensed or not , it seems that dark halo lenses have not been observed yet : statistical argument @xcite and individual properties @xcite imply that current ambiguous quasar pairs are likely to be binary quasars .",
    "even known lensing systems in clusters , such as q0957 + 561 @xcite , are produced mainly by a galaxy in the cluster .",
    "the cluster potential contributes to lensing only as a perturbation .",
    "therefore , it should be checked whether the lack of dark halo lenses in observations really reconciles with the theoretical prediction .",
    "description of baryonic effects needs detailed models for the star formation and feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead ,",
    "in this paper we predict the expected fraction of dark halo lenses on the basis of a simple ( minimal ) parametric model @xcite .",
    "this model comprises the formation probability of galaxies , @xmath0 , and the ratio of circular velocities of galaxies to virial velocities of dark halos , @xmath2 .",
    "the former describes the global efficiency of baryonic compression , and the latter models the modification of inner structure of dark halos due to baryonic compression .",
    "the model parameters are chosen so as to reproduce the velocity function of galaxies and the distribution of image separations .",
    "although there remains the strong degeneracy between model parameters , this degeneracy can be broken from the observation of the fraction of dark halos if we fix the density profile of dark halos .",
    "on the other hand , by restricting a range of @xmath2 from various theories and observations , we can also derive the lower limit of the fraction of dark halo lenses .",
    "our main finding is that steep inner slopes of dark halos ( @xmath8 ) or too centrally concentrated dark halos are inconsistent with the lack of dark halo lenses in observations , even if various uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "although this constraint on the density profile is not so severe , a large lens sample obtained by e.g. , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) can put tighter constraints on the density profile of dark halos as well as the model of baryonic compression .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : th ] , we describe the model of baryonic compression . section [ sec : const ] is devoted to constrain the model parameters , and ",
    "[ sec : frac ] presents our predictions for the fraction of dark halo lenses .",
    "finally , we summarize conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout this paper , we assume the lambda - dominated cosmology @xmath9 , where the hubble constant in units of @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "as shown below , however , our results are quite insensitive to a particular choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "the obvious difference between velocity functions of galaxies and dark halos at high velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that the efficiency of the baryon compression changes from galaxy - mass scale to group- and cluster - mass scales .",
    "if the mass of dark halos is sufficiently large , the baryon cooling time @xmath12 which increases with halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes larger than the age of dark halos which slightly deceases with halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus baryons inside such a massive dark halo do not form so large galaxies as to collect most of baryons in the dark halo .",
    "this yields a steep cutoff at high velocity in the galaxy velocity function . to model this , following @xcite",
    ", we introduce the probability @xmath0 that a sufficiently large galaxy which collects most of internal baryons is formed inside a halo of mass @xmath13 .",
    "for example , galaxy - mass halos with mass @xmath13 usually have large galaxies with mass @xmath14 . on the other hand , groups or clusters also have galaxies but their mass are small even for galaxies which lie at the center of halos , @xmath15 , here in this case @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore we regard galaxies in groups or clusters as `` substructures '' and do not take into account .",
    "we adopt a parametric model @xcite @xmath17 } & \\mbox{($m > m_{\\rm h}$)}. \\end{array } \\right.\\label{gfp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the overall factor of @xmath0 should become another parameter , we neglect it . the effect of the overall factor of @xmath18 on the fraction of dark halo lenses will be discussed in  [ sec : frac ] .",
    "also , there is a difference in the slopes of velocity functions of dark halos and galaxies at small velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this demands the modification of @xmath0 at low @xmath13 . we , however , neglect this effect because we are not interested in low velocity galaxies which hardly contribute to lensing statistics .",
    "the baryon compression also changes inner structure of dark halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "before the baryon cooling occurs , we assume that the density profile of dark halos is well described by the one - parameter family of the form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the concentration parameter .",
    "we adopt the mass and redshift dependence reported by @xcite : @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and generalize it to @xmath24 by multiplying the factor @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we also take account of scatter of the concentration parameter which has a log - normal distribution with the dispersion of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic density @xmath27 can be computed using the spherical collapse model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "while the correct value of @xmath3 is still unclear , the existence of a cups with @xmath28 has been established in recent n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "next consider the modification of inner structure of dark halos induced by baryonic compression .",
    "in general , cooled baryons ( galaxies ) are more centrally concentrated than dark matters .",
    "although complicated physical models are needed to know the modified mass distribution , we simply assume that the mass distribution of galaxies is well described by the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) approximation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a one - dimensional velocity dispersion and is related to the circular velocity @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath31 as a function of halo mass @xmath13 can be described as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the halo virial velocity defined by @xmath35 and @xmath2 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the sis approximation for galaxies is consistent with several observations such as dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the probability @xmath36 and the galaxy circular velocity @xmath37 are given , we can calculate the velocity function of galaxies from the mass function of dark halos : @xmath38 for the mass function @xmath39 , we adopt a fitting form derived by @xcite : @xmath40\\sqrt{\\frac{1.414}{\\pi}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\frac{\\rho_0}{m}\\frac{\\delta_0(z)}{\\sigma_m^2}\\left| \\frac{d\\sigma_m}{dm}\\right    \\label{st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this fitting form coincides more accurately with numerical simulations than the analytic mass function derived by @xcite .",
    "the velocity function is sometimes expressed in terms of @xmath41 as @xmath42 in this calculation we neglect the contribution from `` substructures '' ( i.e. , galaxies in groups and clusters ) , because this mainly changes the normalization of the velocity function which we do not use as a constraint on the model parameters ( see  [ sec : const : vf ] ) .",
    "substructures , however , may affect the fraction of dark halo lenses directly , because it changes only the number of galaxy lenses .",
    "therefore we consider the effect of substructures in predicting the fraction of dark halo lenses ( see  [ sec : frac ] ) .",
    "bearing the picture described in ",
    "[ sec : th : baryon ] in mind , we calculate the probability of gravitational lensing caused by bright galaxies and dark halos separately : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the source redshift , @xmath45 is the lens redshift , @xmath46 is the luminosity of the source , and @xmath39 is the comoving number density of dark halos ( eq . [ [ st ] ] ) .",
    "lensing cross sections @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius of the radial caustic at source plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and between the lens and source , respectively . the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath30 in equation ( [ cs_sis ] ) can be represented as a function of halo mass @xmath13 : @xmath54 where equation ( [ gammav ] ) is used .",
    "the lower limit of integral by mass , @xmath55 , is determined by solving the equation @xmath56 .",
    "the magnification bias @xcite is included in @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the luminosity function of sources and @xmath60 is the magnification factor at @xmath61 .",
    "the total lensing probability with image separation larger than @xmath62 is given by @xmath63",
    "the velocity function is valuable because it is easy to handle theoretically , and is useful to test the model of galaxy formation and cosmology @xcite . using the model described in  [ sec : th : vf ] , we can calculate the velocity function of galaxies from the mass function of dark halos . by comparing the theoretical velocity function with observed velocity functions , one can constrain the model parameters such as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath2 . the definite theoretical prediction , however , needs the _ correct _ value of cosmological parameters such as @xmath66 .",
    "therefore we use the normalized velocity function @xmath67 instead of @xmath68 . moreover , by using @xmath69",
    "we can neglect the effect of the overall factor of @xmath0 . for the observed velocity functions , we use five velocity functions derived by @xcite : velocity functions derived from southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 ) , automatic plate measuring facility survey ( apm ) , united kingdom schmidt telescope survey ( ukst ) , las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) , and k - band survey by @xcite .",
    "we restrict the comparison with observations in the region @xmath70 because of the following two reasons .",
    "one reason is that observed velocity functions are not reliable at the high velocity region ( @xmath71 ) @xcite .",
    "the other reason is the obvious difference between observed and theoretical number density of galaxies at the low velocity region ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the reason of this difference is that in our model we neglect effects of e.g. , supernovae feedback @xcite which substantially suppress the number of galaxies in low - mass halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however we are interested in the gravitational lensing with angular separation larger than current angular resolution ( @xmath73 ) , thus we can safely neglect such low - velocity galaxies which have little impact on our lensing results .",
    "figure [ fig : chis ] shows constraints on model parameters from observed velocity functions .",
    "contours are calculated from ratios of combined likelihood @xmath74 .",
    "errors of observed velocity functions are estimated from errors of fitting parameters of velocity functions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as easily seen from the upper panel of figure [ fig : chis ] , we can put useful constraints on @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the best fit parameter set is @xmath77 .",
    "this means that there still remains strong degeneracy between @xmath65 and @xmath2 : parameter combinations which yield the same @xmath78 can not be discriminated from the velocity functions .",
    "this fact is also shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : chis ] .",
    "one of our best fit parameter sets @xmath79 is compared with observed velocity functions in figure [ fig : vf ] .",
    "it is clearly shown that the prediction of our model shows good coincidence with observed velocity functions .",
    "the distribution of image separations in strong gravitational lensing becomes another test of our model .",
    "the distribution is calculated from equation ( [ dist ] ) . for the observed lens sample ,",
    "we consider the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "this sample is complete at image separations @xmath80 @xcite , and has 18 lenses among @xmath81 radio sources .",
    "sources have the flux distribution @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the mean redshift is estimated to be @xmath83 , although the redshift distribution of sources is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "as in the case of the velocity function , actually we consider the normalized image separation distribution : @xmath84 instead of usual probability distribution .",
    "this is because the absolute probability may suffer from uncertainties of source redshifts , magnification bias , and cosmological parameters . on the other hand",
    "the distribution @xmath85 mainly contains information on the shape of the mass function and effects of baryonic compression @xcite . and",
    "the distribution @xmath85 is quite insensitive to the source population and cosmological parameters , thus can be used for samples in which the source population is unknown such as castles sample .",
    "the distribution of image separations is tested by using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . for the observed distribution",
    ", we use the distribution of class survey .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : ks ] .",
    "we plot contours in @xmath65-@xmath2 plane by fixing @xmath86 which is constrained from the velocity function ( see figure [ fig : chis ] ) . from this figure",
    ", we find that the constraint from the distribution of image separations is consistent with the constraint from the velocity function .",
    "the exception is the case of @xmath87 , where @xmath3 is the inner slope of the density profile of dark halos ( eq . [ [ nfw ] ] ) . in this case , the lower value of @xmath2 becomes inconsistent with the observation , because the lensing cross section for sis is @xmath88 ( see eq . [ [ cs_sis ] ] ) and the lower value of @xmath2 means that the contribution of dark halo lenses becomes more significant .",
    "that is , when @xmath2 is low , the number of dark halo lenses is comparable to that of galaxy lenses , thus a steep cutoff in the distribution of image separations never appears .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the constraint from the distribution of image separations is consistent with the constraint from the velocity function , except for the cutoff of ks probability at low @xmath2 which may appear when @xmath3 is large .",
    "we also compare the distribution of our model with the observed distribution in figure [ fig : sep ] .",
    "the model parameters are chosen so as to satisfy the constraint from the velocity function , and same as those used in figure [ fig : vf ] .",
    "we also plot the distribution assuming that all lens objects are well approximated by sis .",
    "this assumption corresponds to @xmath89 for all @xmath13 .",
    "it is obvious that our model well reproduces the observed distribution while the distribution of all sis assumption is far from the observed distribution , as pointed out by @xcite .      in  [ sec : const : vf ] and  [ sec : const : sep ] , we constrained model parameters from the velocity function of galaxies and the distribution of image separations .",
    "the strong degeneracy between @xmath90 and @xmath2 , however , still remains .",
    "therefore in this subsection we try to put constraints on @xmath2 from various theories and observations .",
    "we consider following three constraints .",
    "first , @xcite gave values of @xmath2 at several halo mass derived from the observation and analysis of galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite and tully - fisher / fundamental plane relations .",
    "the observation of galaxy - galaxy lensing allows us to determine the mass of dark halos and its relation to the luminosity of galaxies .",
    "tully - fisher / fundamental plane relations are used to derive the galaxy circular velocity from its luminosity .",
    "he found that @xmath2 is significantly larger than 1 , @xmath91 around @xmath92 .",
    "he also found the decrease of @xmath2 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 , @xmath94 at @xmath93 .",
    "second , @xcite semi - analytically calculated average values of @xmath2 for galaxies with @xmath95 .",
    "they calculated @xmath2 for various parameter sets of semi - analytic model , and found that most of parameter sets predict @xmath96 .",
    "the most important parameter for @xmath2 is the baryon density @xmath97 , but even in the extreme cases they examined , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath2 becomes @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "third , @xcite considered the analytic disk formation model on the basis of adiabatic compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their model ,",
    "@xmath2 depends on the mass of cooled baryons and the angular momentum of galactic disc .",
    "more specifically , their model is characterized by following three parameters ; the concentration parameter @xmath102 , the ratio of disk mass to halo mass @xmath103 , and the angular momentum @xmath104 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we assume that the concentration parameter is related to halo mass as in equation ( [ bul ] ) .",
    "then @xmath2 at fixed mass depends on @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we examine following two extreme cases : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "most of parameter sets which are physically reasonable predict the value of @xmath2 between these two extreme cases .",
    "the result is summarized in figure [ fig : vcvvir ] .",
    "particularly we are interested in the strong gravitational lensing , thus we focus on the range @xmath107 where gravitational lensing with separations @xmath108 is most efficient . in this range of halo mass ,",
    "various constraints indicate that @xmath2 is restricted to @xmath109 . in particular",
    ", the upper bound of @xmath2 is quite robust because @xmath2 is closely related to the amount of cooled baryons ; to produce @xmath110 , we need the extraordinarily large amount of cooled baryon which exceeds the global baryon mass ratio @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : vcvvir ] also indicates that @xmath2 should slightly depend on halo mass .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath2 , however , is not so important because our interest is restricted in a narrow mass range .",
    "therefore we can safely assume that @xmath2 is constant .",
    "according to the model described in  [ sec : th ] , we predict the fraction of dark halo lenses . in our model , there are three parameters which govern effects of baryonic compression ; @xmath75 , @xmath65 , and @xmath2 . since the constraint from the velocity function of galaxies (  [ sec : const : vf ] ) indicates that @xmath75 should be restricted around @xmath111 , we fix @xmath112 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "on the other hand , the other parameters , @xmath65 and @xmath2 , were poorly constrained from the velocity function of galaxies and the distribution of image separations .",
    "therefore we should see the dependence of the fraction of dark halo lenses on both @xmath65 and @xmath2 . another important parameter we should examine is the inner slope of density profile ( @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ [ nfw ] ] ) , because it is also known that the number of dark halo lenses is extremely sensitive to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of dark halo lenses at image separations @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are calculated from equations ( [ pdark ] ) and ( [ dist ] ) , respectively .",
    "again , @xmath117 is almost independent of the source population ( source redshift and flux distribution ) and cosmological parameters because these primarily change the normalization of the overall lensing rate which we never use .",
    "for the range of image separations , we consider following two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath80 . in this range of image separations ,",
    "class survey is complete @xcite . among 18 lenses observed in class survey ,",
    "virtually all lenses are known to be galaxy lenses @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath118 .",
    "most of current ambiguous quasar pairs which may be dark halo lenses have separations @xmath119 and almost all lenses with smaller separations are known to be produced by normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case we can use all lenses with separations @xmath118 in comparison with our result .",
    "below we assume that there is no dark halo lens for both cases .",
    "figure [ fig : fd_cont ] plots contours of @xmath120 in @xmath90-@xmath2 plane .",
    "the constraint from the velocity function of galaxies is also shown . from this figure",
    ", it is found that the fraction of dark halo lenses is sensitive to @xmath2 : @xmath120 increases as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "the reason is that the cross section of sis lenses scales as @xmath88 ( see eq . [ [ cs_sis ] ] ) and the number of galaxy lenses decreases as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "the fraction of dark halo lenses also increases as @xmath90 decreases , because the number of dark halos which act as dark halo lenses becomes large .",
    "figure [ fig : fd_cont ] indicates that @xmath117 can not be determined uniquely , even if we restrict @xmath65 and @xmath2 such that they satisfy the constraint from the velocity function of galaxies .",
    "this fact is clearly shown in figure [ fig : fd ] . in figure [ fig : fd ] , we plot @xmath120 as a function of @xmath2 . the parameter @xmath65 is chosen so that it satisfies the constraint from the velocity function of galaxies .",
    "this figure indicates that @xmath120 is sensitive to @xmath2 . even if we restrict @xmath121 as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : const : vc ] , @xmath120 has uncertainty of about one order of magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig : fd ] also shows that @xmath120 is sensitive to @xmath3 . from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , @xmath120 also changes about one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , our conclusion is that robust predictions of @xmath120 need information on both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if the density profile of dark halos is determined from several observations , we can break the degeneracy between @xmath65 and @xmath2 from the observation of @xmath120 .",
    "although @xmath120 strongly depends on @xmath2 , we obtain the lower limit @xmath124 by restricting @xmath2 .",
    "discussions in  [ sec : const : vc ] suggest that it is safe to adopt @xmath125 .",
    "thus by setting @xmath126 we can derive @xmath124 , which is shown in figure [ fig : fd_alpha ] . in this figure @xmath127",
    "is plotted against the inner slope @xmath3 .",
    "the lack of dark halo lenses places upper limit on the value of @xmath120 which is also shown in figure [ fig : fd_alpha ] . from this figure , we find that too cuspy inner slope of dark halos ( @xmath4 ) is inconsistent with the lack of dark halo lenses : even if we adopt sufficiently large @xmath2 , @xmath126 , we predict too much dark halo lenses to reconcile with the observation .",
    "this constraint has somewhat different meaning from the one derived from the statistics of wide separation lensing @xcite because such statistics may suffer from the uncertainties of cosmological parameters and the source population .    are there any other effects which may change @xmath120 ?",
    "we consider following two effects which may change our results .",
    "one is the effect of `` substructures '' ( i.e. , galaxies in groups and clusters ) as discussed in  [ sec : th : vf ] .",
    "substructures may affect the fraction of dark halo lenses directly , because it changes only the number of galaxy lenses .",
    "moreover the situation that lens galaxies which lie in groups or clusters is not rare ( e.g. , q0957 + 561 ) , thus the effect should be addressed quantitatively .",
    "although the effect of substructures seems difficult to estimate , @xcite calculated the fraction of lensing galaxies which lie in groups and clusters .",
    "they predicted that @xmath128 of lens galaxies are likely to be in groups or clusters . following this ,",
    "the effect of substructures are simply estimated by replace the probability of galaxy lensing as @xmath129 .",
    "this decreases @xmath120 by a factor @xmath130 at most .",
    "the fraction of dark halo lenses including this effect is also displayed in figure [ fig : fd_alpha ] . as seen in the figure ,",
    "our result that @xmath4 is inconsistent with the observation is not so affected by the effect of substructures .",
    "the other effect is the existence of `` empty halos '' , that is , dark halos which do not host a galaxy .",
    "we have adopted the galaxy formation probability @xmath0 of the form ( [ gfp ] ) , and this means that we have assumed there is no empty halo at @xmath131 .",
    "although this assumption does not conflict with the observation of galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite , it is still possible that the significant amount of empty halos exists at galaxy - mass scale .",
    "this effect , however , only _ increases _ @xmath120 .",
    "therefore _ lower limit _ of @xmath120 used in figure [ fig : fd_alpha ] is never changed by this effect .",
    "the main result of @xcite and @xcite is that the lensing probability of dark halos depends strongly on the choice of concentration parameters as well as inner slopes @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig : fdmin_cont ] we examine @xmath124 for different concentration parameters . in calculating this",
    ", we adopt the concentration parameter of the following form : @xmath132 instead of equation ( [ bul ] ) , and regard @xmath133 as a free parameter .",
    "we plot @xmath124 in @xmath3-@xmath133 plane . from this figure",
    ", it is clearly seen that there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath133 as reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus actually we can constrain the combination of @xmath3 and @xmath133 , or the core mass fraction proposed by @xcite , instead of @xmath3 and @xmath133 separately .",
    "we have studied the effect of baryonic compression assuming the simple parametric model used by @xcite .",
    "our model has following two elements : the galaxy formation probability @xmath0 ( eq . [ [ gfp ] ] ) which describes the global efficiency of baryonic compression , and the ratio of circular velocities of galaxies to virial velocities of dark halos @xmath1 which means how the inner structure of dark halos is modified due to baryonic compression .",
    "the model parameters are constrained from the observed velocity function of galaxies and the distribution of image separations in strong gravitational lensing , although the strong degeneracy between model parameters still remains . by using this model",
    ", we predict the fraction of dark halo lenses @xmath120 ( eq . [ [ fdark ] ] ) . here",
    "dark halo lenses mean the lens systems which are produce by the gravitational potential of dark halos .",
    "the fraction of dark halo lenses is independent of the normalization of total lensing rate , thus is insensitive to cosmological parameters and information of sources such as redshift and flux distribution .",
    "instead the fraction of dark halo lenses is expected to have information on both the effect of baryonic compression and the density profile of dark halos such as the inner density profile for which we modeled @xmath134 .",
    "we found that @xmath120 is indeed sensitive to the inner slope @xmath3 , concentration parameter @xmath133 , and model parameters such as @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , definite predictions of @xmath120 need correct knowledge of baryonic compression as well as the density profile of dark halos .",
    "this also means that we can constrain the model of baryonic compression from the observation of @xmath120 if the density profile of dark halos is well known .",
    "although the fraction of dark halo lenses is difficult to predict , we can still derive the lower limit of @xmath120 by restricting @xmath135 which is inferred from various theories and observations ( see  [ sec : const : vc ] ) .",
    "we found that the steep inner profiles ( @xmath8 ) or too centrally concentrated dark halos are inconsistent with the lack of dark halo lenses in observations .",
    "as described above , our result is quite insensitive to cosmological parameters and source population .",
    "therefore , our result is complementary to the result of @xcite who obtained similar constraint on the density profile of dark halos using the total lensing probability which also depends strongly on cosmological parameters .",
    "one of possible systematic effects which may change @xmath120 is the effect of galaxies in groups or clusters . by using the result of @xcite , we found that this effect changes @xmath120 by a factor @xmath130 at most .",
    "therefore this effect does not change our main result so much .",
    "other important systematic effect is the existence of empty halos which are neglected in our model .",
    "this effect is , however , not important for the lower limit of @xmath120 , because this effect only increases the fraction of dark halo lenses .    one possible criticism of our result is that the baryon compression model we use in this paper is too simple . many of the previous work , however , have not addressed this problem .",
    "for example , most work of gravitational lensing statistics which use the mass function of dark halos assumed that circular velocities of galaxies are the same as virial velocities of dark halos ( this corresponds to @xmath136 in our model ) . but",
    "this assumption seems to be invalid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and since the number of galaxy lenses scales as @xmath137 the deviation from @xmath136 should not be dismissed .",
    "this fact is seen even in our simple model where the connection between galaxy lenses and dark halo lenses sensitively depends on @xmath2 , and is indeed difficult to be determined .",
    "the importance of baryonic compression , however , means that we can constrain the model of baryonic compression from observations of the fraction of dark halo lenses .",
    "although the current sample of gravitational lensing may be too small for this purpose , the larger lens sample obtained by e.g. , sdss can strongly constrain the model of baryonic compression as well as the density profile of dark halos .",
