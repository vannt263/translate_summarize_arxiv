    "two main themes of this work are asymptotic behavior of zeros of certain polynomials and topological properties of related quadratic differentials .",
    "the study of asymptotic root distributions of hypergeometric , jacobi , and laguerre polynomials with variable real parameters , which grow linearly with degree , became a rather hot topic in recent publications , which attracted attention of many authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper , we survey some known results in this area and present some new results keeping focus on jacobi polynomials .    recall that the jacobi polynomial @xmath4 of degree @xmath5 with complex parameters @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 with a non - negative integer @xmath9 and an arbitrary complex number @xmath10 .",

    "if @xmath1227 is a straight line segment in the image domain @xmath72 forming an angle @xmath1045 , @xmath1228 , with the direction of the positive real axis , then @xmath1227 is an image under the canonical mapping ( [ 4.1 ] ) of an arc of a trajectory of the quadratic differential ( [ 10.1 ] ) with @xmath1229    we will use ( [ 10.2 ] ) to find values of @xmath1224 which turn short geodesic loops and short geodesics into short trajectory loops and short trajectories , respectively .",

    "as concerns short critical trajectories for domain configuration of type * 6.1 * , again @xmath1248 is the only value for which there are such trajectories .",

    ". in other cases discussion is similar , we just have to switch roles of the poles of the quadratic differential ( [ 10.1 ] ) .    in this case ,",
    "one more value of @xmath1224 , for which we may have a short trajectory loop ( centered at @xmath501 ) may occur for @xmath1252 .",
    "if @xmath978 then we will have a short geodesic loop from @xmath496 to @xmath496 .",

    "instead , we have two short critical trajectories joining @xmath496 and @xmath497 .    by ( [ 10.2 ] ) , the value of @xmath1224 , which corresponds to the third loop ( if it exists ) is equal to @xmath1254 . as concerns values of @xmath1224 corresponding to short critical trajectories , in case * 6.2 * with @xmath977 we have four such values .",

    "the third value @xmath1261 generates two short critical trajectories .",
