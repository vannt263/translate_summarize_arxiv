    "determining the electromagnetic field of a charge moving along an arbitrary trajectory is a standard textbook problem in electrodynamics .",
    "conventionally , the electromagnetic field of a charge moving along an arbitrary trajectory is obtained by solving the wave equation to obtain the linard - wiechert potentials and then calculating the required derivatives of the potentials with respect to position and time.@xcite the linard - wiechert potentials are found to be expressible as functions of the retarded time , which is an implicit function of the position at which the field is being evaluated and the trajectory of the charge .",
    "this implicit dependence makes differentiating the potentials an elaborate procedure , involving complicated algebra and obscuring the physical significance of the final result .",
    "we present here an alternative derivation of the electromagnetic field of an arbitrarily moving charge , using manifestly lorentz invariant , four - dimensional notation , without ever obtaining the linard - wiechert potentials or differentiating any expression with respect to the retarded time .",
    "the key idea is that we can derive the electromagnetic fields of a charge in the lorentz frame at which the charge was instantaneously at rest at the retarded time . in principle , making a lorentz transformation will give the fields in the original frame.@xcite in practice , the second step turns out to be as laborious as the standard derivation and the algebra is complicated and unilluminating . in addition to the fact that lorentz transformations mix up @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we need to express all the original 3-vectors in terms of the corresponding 3-vectors in the new frame . in doing so , we can not use the standard lorentz transformation equations which are valid when the velocity is along the x - axis ( say ) , but must instead use the more complicated lorentz formula for the velocity along an arbitrary direction . therefore , we adopt a different , manifestly lorentz invariant approach to tackle the problem , but in the same spirit .",
    "the essential physical ingredients in this derivation are the following : the electromagnetic field at the observation point can depend only on the relative position , the velocity , and the acceleration of the charge , all evaluated at the retarded time , but not on further derivatives of the trajectory .",
    "the electromagnetic field of a charge that experiences an impulsive acceleration , that is , an arbitrary but finite acceleration for a short time interval , can be obtained from physical arguments .",
    "this derivation is originally due to j.  j.  thomson.@xcite the generalization of the thomson formula to a charge moving with any nonzero ( and possibly relativistic ) velocity is possible by using arguments based on lorentz invariance .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] we construct the most general expression for the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath2 in terms of the variables in the problem .",
    "this general expression contains three arbitrary functions of the lorentz scalars , which need to be determined using further information . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] we fix these functions by using an independent physical argument based on the thomson formula and thus determine @xmath2 completely .",
    "our resulting expression for the electric field matches that obtained by the standard procedure of differentiating the linard - wiechert potentials .",
    "we summarize our results in a brief concluding section .",
    "consider a charge moving along an arbitrary trajectory @xmath3 whose electromagnetic field @xmath4 at the observation point @xmath5 is to be evaluated .",
    "we will use four - dimensional notation with signature ",
    ", + , + , + ; the latin letters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8  run through @xmath9 and the greek letters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , denote the spatial components 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "we shall use units in which @xmath13 . in the conventional approach the current four - vector @xmath14",
    "is first obtained from the trajectory of the charge .",
    "then , using the relation @xmath15 , the four - potential @xmath16 ( the linard - wiechert potentials ) is calculated .",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath17 is then found by the relation @xmath18 .",
    "the definition makes clear that @xmath17 is antisymmetric , that is , @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 terms give the components of the electric field , and the @xmath21 terms lead to the components of the magnetic field .",
    "this procedure of differentiating the linard - wiechert potentials with respect to @xmath5 is tedious because these potentials are expressible only as functions of the retarded proper time @xmath22 which is an implicit function of @xmath5 and @xmath3 .    in our alternative approach to this problem",
    "we begin with a simple physical idea .",
    "we note that the electromagnetic field at the observation point @xmath5 may depend only on the relative position @xmath23 , the velocity @xmath24 , and the acceleration @xmath25 of the charge , all evaluated at the retarded time @xmath22 , but not on further derivatives of the trajectory .",
    "this result arises from the following :    \\(a ) because electromagnetic signals propagate at the speed of light , the field at @xmath5 is determined by the state of the source at an earlier position @xmath26 which is related to @xmath5 by a null line ; that is , by the condition @xmath27 .",
    "of the two roots to this equation , we choose the retarded ( causal ) solution that satisfies the condition @xmath28 .",
    "this condition determines the retarded time @xmath22 .",
    "\\(b ) translational",
    "invariance implies that the field depends only on the relative position @xmath29 of the charge with respect to the observation point ( evaluated at the retarded time ) , and not on the absolute positions of the source or the observation point separately .",
    "\\(c ) because @xmath30 , @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "because @xmath33 is at most linear in the velocity of the charge , @xmath34 is at most linear in the acceleration , and no further derivatives of the trajectory can occur in the solution @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is a second rank antisymmetric tensor which is built from @xmath29 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 . at this stage",
    "it is convenient to introduce the lorentz invariant scalar @xmath36 which in the rest frame of the charge reduces to @xmath37 where @xmath38 because of the condition @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the retarded solution . for simplicity",
    ", we will also define a four - vector @xmath41 through the relation @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the components of @xmath41 are @xmath45 which reduces in the rest frame of the charge to the unit spatial vector pointing from the charge to the field point : @xmath46 .",
    "we will trade off the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath17 for the @xmath41 dependence and treat @xmath17 as a function of @xmath41 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 ( instead of @xmath29 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "hence the most general form of @xmath17 can be written as @xmath47 } + f_2 n^{[i } a^{j ] } + f_3 n^{[i } u^{j]},\\ ] ] where the square brackets denote antisymmetrization ( that is , @xmath48 } = a^i u^j - a^j u^i$ ] ) and the functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 can depend on the scalars that can be constructed from @xmath41 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 . because @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , the only non - trivial scalars which are available to us are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . because @xmath17 is at most linear in @xmath35 , it can not depend on @xmath58 , and hence @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 can depend only on the remaining two scalars @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "further , the condition of linearity in @xmath35 also requires that @xmath49 and @xmath50 can not depend on @xmath59 ( because these functions are multiplied by a term linear in @xmath35 ) and can depend only on @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the most general expression for @xmath17 in terms of @xmath41 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 becomes : @xmath61 } + f_2(\\ell ) n^{[i } a^{j ] } + f_3(g,\\ell ) n^{[i } u^{j]},\\ ] ] with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 arbitrary functions of the scalars which are as yet undetermined .",
    "we comment that in constructing the most general second rank antisymmetric tensor out of @xmath41 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 , we can also include the three terms of the form @xmath62}$ ] involving the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for omitting terms of this type in eq .   is as follows .",
    "when @xmath63 multiplies an antisymmetric ( true ) tensor @xmath64 , for example , we obtain the dual tensor @xmath65 which is not a true tensor , but a pseudotensor ; that is , it transforms differently from true tensors under reflections of the co - ordinate system .",
    "we know that the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath17 is a true tensor .",
    "hence , we can not have pseudotensorial terms such as @xmath62}$ ] in the general expression for @xmath17 .",
    "our next task is to determine @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , which will completely solve the problem .",
    "we proceed by considering the two four vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 the vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 contain the same amount of information as @xmath17 as can be seen by the explicit expression for the latter in terms of the former : @xmath69 which can be easily verified by direct substitution of into eq .",
    "( [ ebfij ] ) and the use of the identities @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "incidentally , these identities , which follow from the definitions in and the antisymmetry of @xmath17 and @xmath72 , also show that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both orthogonal to @xmath24 , and hence , in a given reference frame , they contain only three independent components .",
    "we substitute into and find @xmath73 if we know the explicit forms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in terms of the variables in the problem , we can determine the functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 by direct comparison .",
    "the four vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 have direct physical interpretations and represent the electric and magnetic fields in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge with four velocity @xmath24 . in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge in which @xmath74 only the component @xmath75 contributes and @xmath76 , because @xmath17 is antisymmetric .",
    "hence , the spatial components of @xmath77 correctly represent the components of the electric field in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge .",
    "similarly , in the instantaneous rest frame , only the component @xmath75 contributes to @xmath67 .",
    "because @xmath72 is completely antisymmetric , the time component of @xmath67 vanishes in this frame .",
    "we see that the spatial components of @xmath67 are given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "hence the spatial components of @xmath67 lead to the correct values of the magnetic field components in the rest frame .",
    "we now will obtain explicit expressions for the ( three - dimensional ) electric and magnetic field vectors in the rest frame by using an independent physical argument .",
    "from these explicit expressions we will construct two four - vectors , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , such that the spatial components of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are equivalent to the electric and magnetic three - vectors in the rest frame and the time components of @xmath80 and @xmath81 vanish in this frame .",
    "if we use the fact that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are generally covariant four - dimensional quantities and are identical in the rest frame with the original @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( by construction ) , we can equate the general expressions , @xmath82 to @xmath80 and @xmath83 to @xmath81 , and thereby determine the functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the physical argument to determine the electric and magnetic field vectors is based on the physically transparent expression for the electromagnetic field due to j.  j.  thomson.@xcite this expression is usually given for a charged particle moving with non - relativistic velocities and becomes exact in the limit of @xmath84 .",
    "its derivation is reproduced and discussed in standard texts.@xcite for convenience we give a brief derivation in the appendix .",
    "the analysis considers a charge that is moving with a uniform ( non - relativistic ) velocity , experiences a finite acceleration @xmath85 for an infinitesimal time interval @xmath86 , and then continues to move with uniform velocity .",
    "the expression for the electromagnetic field under these conditions can be expressed as : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the coulomb field of a charge at rest a distance @xmath89 from the observation point with @xmath90 the unit vector in the radial direction .",
    "also @xmath91 is the radiation field of the charge , transverse to the radial direction , due to the acceleration @xmath85 of the charge .",
    "we can thus rewrite as : @xmath92 \\\\ \\label{4 } \\mathbf{b } & = - \\frac{q}{r } \\left [ \\mathbf{\\hat n}\\times \\mathbf{a}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in conventional units the radiation field terms ( in eqs .",
    "( [ thomaccn ] ) , , and ( [ 4 ] ) ) will each contain a @xmath93 factor in the denominator .",
    "we now show that the electric and magnetic fields in eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) also represent the electromagnetic field of a charge in arbitrary motion , in the instantaneous rest frame at the retarded time .",
    "although this fact is intuitively obvious , we give a formal argument to make our derivation complete .",
    "let us compare the fields of two charges @xmath94 and @xmath95 that have two different trajectories .",
    "the charge @xmath94 is the one of interest and moves along an arbitrary trajectory .",
    "we make a lorentz transformation to the instantaneous rest frame ( at the retarded time ) of @xmath94 . in this frame",
    "the charge @xmath94 is at rest , but it has an instantaneous acceleration @xmath96 .",
    "the charge @xmath95 is chosen to have the same acceleration and position as charge @xmath94 for a small time interval @xmath86 around the retarded time and moves with a uniform velocity later on . the position ( at the origin ) , velocity ( equal to zero ) , and acceleration ( equal to @xmath96 ) of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are identical at the retarded time , and because the electromagnetic field depends only on these quantities , both charges will lead to the same fields at the observation point .",
    "the trajectories of the two charges are quite different after a time @xmath86 ( with @xmath94 moving along some arbitrary curve while @xmath95 moves with a uniform velocity ) , but the expression for the radiation field , , can not depend on the future trajectory of charge @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , we have obtained the important result that in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge @xmath94 , eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) give the correct form of the electromagnetic field .",
    "equations  ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) are three - dimensional expressions for the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we use these expressions to now construct four - vectors , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , such that their spatial components give the above three - vectors in the rest frame , and their time components vanish in that frame .",
    "we begin by noting that @xmath89 in is the value of the lorentz scalar @xmath97 in the rest frame .",
    "also , in the rest frame we have @xmath46 and @xmath98 .",
    "we use these results to generalize to four - dimensions as @xmath99.\\ ] ] the structure of this four vector is unique and easy to understand . we would have expected it to be a linear combination of @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath24 with coefficients depending on the scalars built out of them . but a term linear in @xmath24 can not occur because @xmath24 in the rest frame has only the time component but @xmath35 and @xmath41 have only space components",
    ". so their linear combination can not vanish in the rest frame ( and give @xmath100 ) if there is a term with @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath35 and @xmath41 are uniquely fixed by the form of . also , note",
    "that @xmath80 contains one term which goes as @xmath101 and one term which goes as @xmath102 , which come from the three - dimensional coulomb field and radiation field respectively .    to generalize we note the appearance of the cross product . in three dimensions a cross product",
    "is represented by making use of the completely antisymmetric tensor @xmath103 .",
    "we thus need a tensor that goes over to @xmath103 in the instantaneous rest frame .",
    "consider the tensor @xmath104 . in the rest frame , as mentioned before , the contribution is only from @xmath75 . because @xmath72 is antisymmetric ,",
    "all the components of @xmath104 when @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath105 is zero , vanish in the rest frame .",
    "hence , the non - zero components of the tensor @xmath104 are identical to those of @xmath106 in the rest frame .",
    "hence , @xmath104 is the tensor we need and can thus be generalized as @xmath107 we see that in the rest frame , the time component of eq .",
    "vanishes and the spatial components give the magnetic field .",
    "all that remains is to equate the explicit forms for @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eqs .   and to the general expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath83 in involving the undetermined functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and",
    "determine the latter .",
