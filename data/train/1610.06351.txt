    "the collimation mechanism of jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) remains one of the open questions in high energy astrophysics .",
    "structural studies of the jet in the collimation zone , which requires an imaging in ( sub-)milliarcsecond resolution , have been uniquely provided by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "it has been found that some of the jets in the nearby sources are gradually collimated on pc scales ( e.g. , ( m87 : * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter an12 ) ; ( 3c84 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ) , while the majority of distant blazar jets exhibit ( freely expanding ) conical shape on the scale beyond @xmath1 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes are often invoked to explain their collimation together with acceleration properties @xcite . in principle",
    ", the bulk acceleration of mhd jets takes place in a parabolic stream @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear whether the external confinement by the environment plays a crucial role , or self - collimation by the toroidal magnetic field ( i.e. , hoop stress ) alone can be responsible ; the latter mechanism is most likely for non - relativistic jets ( e.g. , young stellar object jets , * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations of m87 has found that the structural transition of the jet from a parabolic to conical shape takes place at around the bondi accretion radius , the outermost extent of the gravitational influence upon ambient gas by the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , suggesting that the agn jet collimation is subject to thermal confinement by the stratified interstellar medium ( ism ) (; ( * ? ? ? * hereafter na13 ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the simultaneity of gradual acceleration and collimation are also detected in the m87 jet with vlbi monitoring observations (;",
    "however , such a jet structural study with multiple orders of magnitude in axial distance has been only conducted for m87 so far .",
    "ngc 6251 is a nearby ( @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) giant elliptical galaxy , which has an exceptionally straight and long jet ( @xmath3 mpc in projection , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore serves as one of the best targets for structural studies of agn jets . its kpc - scaled radio emission has been investigated in great detail using the very large array ( vla ) @xcite , and the pc - scaled jet emission using vlbi continuously extending to @xmath4 mas @xcite .",
    "the mass of the smbh is measured to be m @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "taking the distance ( @xmath6 mpc ) into account , ngc 6251 provides a viable apparent size ( 0.50pcmas@xmath7 or 8700@xmath8mas@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the schwarzschild radius , ) to examine the jet structure across the gravitational regimes dominated by both the smbh and the host galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we report a detection of the structural transition of the ngc 6251 jet that is found with the aid of our new european vlbi network ( evn ) images at 1.6 ghz .",

    "we show our analysis and result in section [ sec - result ] . in section",
    "[ sec - discuss ] , we discuss the location of the transition , the properties of the pressure , and the comparison with m87 in order to understand the origin of the collimation processes . the angular scale used in this paper is obtained with a cosmology of @xmath9kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we conducted evn observations of ngc 6251 on 2013 march 10 at 1.6 ghz with the badary , svetloe , zelenchukskaya ( russia ) , effelsberg ( germany ) , jodrell bank ( uk ) , medicina , noto ( italy ) , onsala ( sweden ) , shanghai , urumqi ( china ) , torun ( poland ) , and westerbork ( netherlands ) stations . both left , and right circular polarization data were recorded at each station using eight sub - bands of 8 mhz bandwidth and 2-bit sampling .",
    "the data were correlated at the jive ( joint institute for vlbi in europe ) correlator .",
    "data were calibrated following the standard procedures in aips .",
    "a priori amplitude calibration for each station was derived from the system temperatures measured during each run and the antenna gain curves .",
    "fringe fitting was performed to remove the residual delays and rates by assuming a point source model . after applying the solutions ,",
    "the data were exported to difmap and averaged over @xmath12 s in each sub - band . then the gain phase and amplitude were self - calibrated by the iterative process of clean to obtain the final image .",
    "more detailed observational parameters are described in table [ tab-1 ] .",
    "archival very long baseline array ( vlba ) data at 5 ghz are used and calibrated in the same manner as the evn data .",
    "also , 12 epochs of the vlba data at 15 ghz are obtained from the mojave database @xcite .",
    "observations were conducted during @xmath13 .",
    "we reproduce all images in agreement with the mojave database . in order to perform a joint analysis ,",
    "images of the 12 epochs are convolved with the same circular beam with full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.54 mas ( see more details in table [ tab-1 ] ) .",
    "we also use a published very large array ( vla ) image of ngc 6251 at 1.4 ghz to compare with the vlbi measurements in section [ subsec - support ] .",
    "the image , as well as the calibration processes , is shown in @xcite .",
    "observations were conducted on 1995 august 15 using the full vla in its a - configuration .",
    "the beam is restored to be circular with an fwhm of 2 .",
    "figure [ fig - image ] shows high dynamic range images of ngc 6251 taken with our evn observations at 1.6 ghz , and the archival vlba data at 5 and 15 ghz ; table [ tab-1 ] summarizes the detailed image parameters ( e.g. , beam size , dynamic range ) .",
    "the evn images are obtained with different weighting schemes ( denoted as evn - i , -ii and -iii ) to enhance the sensitivity of the emission at various angular scales .",
    "the brightest component at the eastern edge of the object is presumably the core , and a continuous jet emission extends towards the northwest .",
    "the jet direction and the knotty features are consistent with each other in all images .",
    "this is the first time to see the jet emission associated with ngc 6251 is continuously detected at a distance range of @xmath14 mas away from the core .      to investigate the collimation profile of the jet",
    ", we derive the radius ( half width ) of the jet emission along the jet axis in each image .",
    "we mainly adopt the methodology of an12 as follows ; in addition , the change of the jet direction in different length scales ( i.e. , jet bending ) is taken into consideration :    1 .",
    "the position angles ( pa ) of the jet direction is determined by the averaged pas of all clean components excluding the core region , weighted by their flux density .",
    "the cross sections of the jet are fitted with a single gaussian function of fwhm @xmath15 at every @xmath16 of the beam size ( as independent measurements , the resolution limit was studied by @xcite ) along the jet axis to evaluate the transverse structure .",
    "the jet radius @xmath17 ( i.e. , half of the jet width ) is thus defined as half the fwhm of the resultant fitted gaussian which is deconvolved from the beam fwhm @xmath18 taking into account the beam orientation , i.e. , @xmath19 , ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty is estimated from the gaussian fitting error ( in step 2 ) , and the imaging error that is evaluated as : 1 .   the dispersion ( standard deviation ) of the 12-epoch measurements for the vlba data at 15 ghz .",
    "@xmath20 for the other frequencies due to the lack of enough independent observations . particularly for the evn data , the jet radii",
    "are further averaged over both polarizations ( i.e. , rr and ll ) .",
    "the measurements are presented in a machine readable format in table [ tab-2 ] . in our analysis ,",
    "the jet pa mildly decreases as the length scale increases , ranging from @xmath21 ( see also table [ tab-1 ] ) , which is similarly detected by @xcite .",
    "all jet cross sections are well represented with a single gaussian component .    to properly evaluate the uncertainty",
    ", we utilized the multi - epoch vlba data at 15 ghz .",
    "the jet radii derived in 12 epochs are in good agreement with each other so that we obtain the standard deviation ( @xmath22 ) of the jet radii as the imaging error .",
    "we estimated the distribution of @xmath22 as a function of signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath23 ) , and found it to be well described by a power - law function , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath22 is about 0.01 mas at the innermost jet region where the @xmath25 , while 0.1 mas at the jet downstream where the @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath16 of the beam size , respectively .",
    "therefore , we consider the upper limit of the imaging error to be @xmath20 as the jet radii are measured where the jet is detected when the @xmath28 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a for similar analysis ) .",
    "note that we assume the time variability of the jet radius is negligible .",
    "figure [ fig - rz ] shows the distribution of jet radius ( @xmath17 ) as a function of the de - projected distance to the core ( @xmath29 ) , which we refer to as the radius profile of the jet . the jet viewing angle ( @xmath30 ) for de - projection is uncertain within an upper limit of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath32 derived from a detection of a sub - pc scale counter - jet @xcite . an independent spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model suggests a consistent result of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we use the de - projected length scale ( @xmath34mas@xmath7 ) along the jet throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "note that the jet radius , as defined perpendicular to the jet axis , is not affected by projection effects .",
    "collimation profiles are generally described by power - law functions with some local features , as a manifestation of the global evolution of jet structure .",
    "we perform regression analyses with single and double power - law models throughout the whole vlbi dataset and show the results and their relative residuals in figure [ fig - rz ] .",
    "note that the power - law indices , @xmath35 , are defined as  @xmath36  throughout the paper .",
    "first , we fit the data with a single power - law model , @xmath37 , @xmath38 which gives the best fit using a power - law index of @xmath39 , with a @xmath40 ( see also table [ tab-3 ] ) .",
    "the radius profile can be described well with this power - law in the range of @xmath41 , however , it systematically deviates at each end .",
    "then , we test a double power - law model , in the form of the broken power - law function , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ^{1/n},\\ ] ] so that we can simultaneously solve for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are the upstream and downstream power - law indices ( pre- and post - break ) , the break position , and the jet radius at the break position , respectively , and @xmath48 is a controlling parameter for the sharpness of the break , i.e. , the sharper break , the larger @xmath48 .",
    "the radius profile is best fitted with the model parameters listed in table [ tab-3 ] , with @xmath49 s @xmath50 by adopting different @xmath51 .",
    "note that the different values of sharpness ( i.e. , choices between @xmath48 ) result in changes of the best fitted parameters ( see also table [ tab-3 ] ) .",
    "particularly , a small value of @xmath52 implies a smooth transition with a significant amount of data located amid the two pure power - law branches , causing an increase of the uncertainty for both @xmath44 and @xmath46",
    ". however , the resultant fittings are all fairly consistent ( in 1__@xmath53 _ _ , and 2__@xmath53 _ _ for @xmath54 and 2 cases ) with power - law indices @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and the distance of the transition ( break position ) @xmath57 regardless of the sharpness .",
    "in addition , their relative residuals are uniformly distributed in all distance scales .",
    "the oscillatory pattern in the radius profile presumably corresponding to a local enhancement of the emissivity , potentially affects the quantification of the power - law index of the upstream . in order to have a better constraint , it is important to extend the jet structural studies towards the inner regions .",
    "future ( sub-)mm vlbi observations , with unprecedented angular resolution , are expected to provide a unique chance to unveil the initial point of collimation and even the genesis of agn jets .",
    "next , we perform a statistical test ( an f - test ) to check if the double power - law model is necessary .",
    "given the f - ratio of 1.71 ( i.e. , the ratio of @xmath49 ) with the degrees of freedom of the single and double power - law fitting , @xmath58 and 187 , respectively , the null hypothesis that the two models fit the population of the data equally well corresponds to a small probability @xmath59 . as a result ,",
    "the double power - law model is significantly better than the single power - law to describe the radius profile of the ngc 6251 jet .",
    "also , this is further supported by the measurements in both the outer and inner region taken with the vla and vlbi core data ( see section [ subsec - support ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the structure of the ngc 6251 jet is described by a parabolic shape ( @xmath60 ) upstream , a conical expansion ( @xmath61 ) downstream , and the structural transition takes place at a characteristic distance scale of @xmath62 .",
    "the ngc 6251 jet is the second observational evidence of the structural transition from parabolic to conical shape occurring at a scale of @xmath63 in agn jet systems , following the result of m87 .",
    "we take a step further to investigate the jet structure beyond the two distance ends , which are shown as the gray data points in figure [ fig - rz ] . the radius profile on kpc scales",
    "are derived from an archival vla image ( as introduced in section [ subsec - vla ] ) , which was similarly measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig - rz ] shows their innermost portion ( with distances @xmath64kpc ) to guide the comparison , which is smoothly connected to the radius profile predicted by the double power - law model , while largely deviated from the single power - law model .",
    "the vla measurements additionally support that the vlbi jet downstream is better described by a conical shape ( @xmath65 ) which propagates three orders of magnitude in distance , if the jet structure is indeed linked together on the intermediate scales ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "note that the vla data are not included in the previous regression analysis .",
    "to study the missing link of the jet structure requires facilities with an adequate angular resolution ( e.g. , vla , merlin ) , which will be investigated in future work .    on the other side ,",
    "vlbi cores are considered as the innermost jet emissions , originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "the frequency dependent core - shift ( @xmath67 ) due to synchrotron self - absorption enables us to estimate the exact location of the innermost components with respect to the black hole , and hence the innermost jet structure and its width .",
    "this technique has been previously demonstrated in m87 ( e.g. , @xcite , ) . in ngc 6251 ,",
    "the core - shift between 15 and 5 ghz was estimated to be @xmath68mas by image registration with the optically thin jet @xcite . together with the transverse widths ( fwhm , deconvolved from the beam ) of the cores , the sub - pc - scaled jet radii can be estimated by the vlba and evn cores ( see also figure [ fig - rz ] ) .",
    "once again , they are relatively consistent with the upstream that is predicted by the double power - law model rather than the single power - law . as a result , we expect that the jet maintains a parabolic shape for at least two orders of magnitude in distance .",
    "interestingly , the power - law index of the jet upstream ( @xmath69 ) is very close to the genuinely parabolic field configuration in which the jet extracts electromagnetic energy from a spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "the core - shift measurements of ngc 6251 at higher frequencies ( i.e. , sub - mm bands ) can be very helpful to understand the jet formation process as well as to extend the structural study .",
    "we consider the gravitational potential of the ngc6251 environment : the smbh and the host galaxy .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig - rz ] , it is found that the structural transition is close to the boundary of the sphere of gravitational influence ( sgi , @xmath70 ) in order of magnitude , where the central smbh dominates the gravitational potential .",
    "sgi is defined as @xmath71  gm/@xmath72 under the assumption that the stellar distribution is random - motion supported rather than rotationally , where @xmath73 is the velocity dispersion of the collective stars , i.e. , the elliptical galaxy here @xcite . in ngc6251 , it is measured by optical spectroscopy that @xmath74 kms@xmath7 in the galaxy and the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion @xmath75 , which gives our estimates of the @xmath76 above .",
    "the estimated sgi can be an upper limit , since one may expect much larger @xmath77 towards the nuclei of ngc 6251 , for we can not spatially resolve the region at present .",
    "note that the evaluation of the sgi may be affected by the triaxiality of the bulge , or the warped disky structure in the nucleus possibly due to galaxy merging , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a study of the stellar velocity structure with an angular resolution @xmath78 10 mas will be helpful to narrow down this issue .",
    "however , we believe that both effects are insignificant in order of magnitude estimates . approximately , the cool core is expected to be thermodynamically stable , so that virial equilibrium is considered for the gas as well as for the stars . as a consequence , the bondi radius",
    "( @xmath79  2gm/@xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the local sound speed ) is expected to be close to the sgi .",
    "for instance , m87 , which is the very limited case we can directly compare those two numbers thanks to its proximity , the bondi radius is indeed close to the sgi ( @xmath82 , and the references therein , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 kms@xmath7 , @xcite ; we adopt a smbh mass of @xmath85 @xcite . )",
    "therefore , the bondi radius in ngc6251 is expected to be a few @xmath63 with a virial temperature @xmath86kev derived from the velocity dispersion , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are mean molecular weight and proton mass .",
    "independently , we estimate @xmath89 kms@xmath7 with an upper limit of temperature @xmath90kev , which is extrapolated from x - ray observation on a scale of 20 kpc ( or 10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are adiabatic index , pressure , and density of the gas .",
    "this estimation gives a lower limit of the bondi radius to be @xmath94 and well agrees with the former expectation .",
    "note that the extrapolation is made towards the bondi radius assuming a flat temperature profile , which was demonstrated in many simulations that the profile is nearly flat in a cool core of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we compare the collimation ( radius ) profile of the jet in ngc 6251 to that in m87 , as the structural transition of the m87 jet is also located at around the bondi radius .",
    "figure [ fig - comparison ] shows their jet radii and de - projected distances respectively normalized by their schwarzschild radii . located in the same type of galaxy ,",
    "the two jets show remarkably similar structures .",
    "they both undergo a structural transition at a scale of @xmath63 , suggesting an interplay with the galactic environment , i.e. , the smbh and its host galaxy",
    ". the collimation process of agn jets may be fundamentally characterized by external galactic medium , which has been argued that the stratified ism is responsible .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that the jet can be confined by the wind generated from the accretion flow within the bondi radius @xcite .",
    "the jet internal pressure is estimated to be compared with the external medium .",
    "we consider the ngc 6251 jet a relativistic system organized by helical magnetic field , i.e. , the toroidal component of the field ( denoted by @xmath95 in the observer s frame , and @xmath96 in the fluid comoving frame , where @xmath97 is the bulk lorentz factor ) is dominant farther from the black hole .    assuming the jet satisfies the synchrotron minimum energy condition @xcite , the magnetic field strength @xmath95 is estimated as @xmath98^{2/7},\\ ] ] ( equivalently , the internal pressure @xmath99 ) by using the radio emissivity along the jet .",
    "first , we adopt a spectral index @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) that has been found in both the kpc- and pc - scaled ( optically thin ) jet @xcite , and a nominal frequency integrand of @xmath102 mhz to estimate the synchrotron luminosity @xmath103 , as well as to determine the factor @xmath104 ; we set the proton - to - electron energy ratio @xmath105 as a strict minimum ; the emitting volume @xmath106 is estimated with a filling factor @xmath107 and a circular jet cross - section characterized by the jet radius , which is derived in section [ sec - result ] .",
    "second , we estimate the bulk lorentz factor @xmath97 by adopting an empirical correlation @xmath108 with the half opening angle @xmath109 , which has been found in large samples of agn jets . this relation is also demonstrated in the mhd models , indicating a causally connected jet in the acceleration zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , figure [ fig - pressure ] shows the field strength ( @xmath110 ) together with the jet pressure ( @xmath111 ) in the fluid frame .",
    "note that true minimum - energy field strength can be one order of magnitude higher than the strict lower limit by tuning the parameters mentioned above .      to maintain a parabolic jet ( @xmath112 ) in the upstream , pressure matching",
    "is expected between the jet boundary and the external ism ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "analytical and numerical models have shown that the magnetized jet can be genuinely parabolic when the ism pressure has a profile of @xmath114 , @xmath115 @xcite , as the black dotted line plotted in figure [ fig - pressure ] .",
    "interestingly , this is consistent with the estimated minimum - energy jet pressure profile , if there is no significant change in the synchrotron parameters .",
    "in addition , at the structural transition , the estimated jet pressure @xmath116 a few @xmath117dyn@xmath118 is in agreement with the external ism pressure at the sgi ( or , the bondi radius ) @xmath119dyn@xmath118 , where we adopt a nominal range of electron number density in typical radio galaxies @xmath120@xmath121 @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is reasonable to believe that the external pressure of the parabolic jet has a profile of @xmath122 , which is consistent with radiative inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) models ( @xmath123 , and the references therein ) .",
    "similar discussions can be referred to in and .",
    "note the accretion type of the smbh in ngc 6251 remains a matter of debate : riaf or standard accretion disk .",
    "@xcite suggested that an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , a sub - type of riaf ) is present in the nucleus of ngc 6251 based on the radio - to - x - ray sed . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray spectral properties are in favor of the presence of a standard accretion disk .",
    "our result supports riaf to be the accretion type in ngc 6251 .      beyond the structural transition ,",
    "the jet changes its structure in a conical shape ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we consider two scenarios to form a conical jet regarding the pressure properties at the structural transition , which we call a sharp transition ( @xmath125 ) and a smooth transition ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "a sharp transition is that the jet becomes over - pressured with respect to the external pressure at the transition while it undergoes an over - collimation ( due to a compression shock ) and turns into conical shape . in the case of m87 ,",
    "the knot complex ( hst-1 ) , which is located at the structural transition in the m87 jet , is likely caused by an imbalance between @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( and the reference therein ) .",
    "as figure [ fig - pressure ] shows , @xmath127 is nearly a constant in the conical jet regime as suggested by the estimation on the sgi and by x - ray measurements @xcite , which is expected in the galactic environment beyond the sgi .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite in an mhd simulation that an over - pressured jet can be conically expanding in a flat external medium .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the jet is over - pressured because the lower limit of the minimum - energy jet pressure is comparable to the external pressure .",
    "we note that @xmath97 ( or , the jet speed ) is one of the important parameters , where it is assumed following @xmath108 , i.e. , no deceleration in the conical jet . in the case of m87",
    ", the jet has also shown to have a peak apparent speed at the transition @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the kpc - scaled pressure estimates of ngc6251 show a significant difference between the estimated jet pressure ( given by the vla measurements ) and the external pressure , which can be compensated if we take the deceleration into account .",
    "meanwhile , a transition of the jet pressure will be expected around the structural transition , and then an over - pressured jet ( @xmath125 ) can be explained .",
    "nevertheless , in the structure of the ngc6251 jet , we currently see neither a sudden decrease of the jet radius ( i.e. , over - collimation ) , nor an isolated prominent knot as a counterpart of hst-1 in the m87 jet so far , while there is a jagged shape in the radius profile near the sgi ( @xmath128 pc ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that proper motion studies reported by mojave program show several knotty features moving in subluminal apparent speeds @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "time variability may explain the current absence of such a knotty feature ( hst-1 is also time varying , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an over - collimated region at the sgi as well as the apparent jagged shape",
    ". further monitoring observation with evn and observations with higher angular resolution across the transverse direction is important to unveil the true structure of the jet , and to measure the bulk lorentz factor @xmath97 .",
    "a polarization imaging may be helpful in probing this transition and the nature of the stationary knot .",
    "we also suggest that a similar analysis can be applied to m87 in order to constrain the jet pressure of the conical expansion beyond the transition .",
    "we may also consider a smooth transition : the condition of pressure matching is kept on the jet boundary ( @xmath113 ) with the smooth structural transition . in addition to the smooth structural transition ( i.e. , no over - collimation ) , figure [ fig - pressure ] shows that the lower limit of the minimum - energy jet pressure seems to connect with the external pressure .",
    "@xcite shows that an mhd jet maintains a conical shape under the condition that the external pressure with a drastically dropping profile @xmath130 in the constant jet speed regime .",
    "it would be , however , difficult to meet this condition as we described in figure [ fig - pressure ] , the external pressure is nearly a constant in the conical jet regime as suggested by the estimation on the sgi and by x - ray measurements . in order to keep the conical ( expanding ) structure of the jet with the condition of pressure matching to the flat external pressure profile , in - situ energy dissipation is needed to sustain the jet internal pressure @xmath131 as constant .",
    "one of the possibilities would be the conversion from the bulk kinetic energy to the jet internal energy .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggests a gradual and substantial deceleration of the jet velocity located at @xmath132 kpc from the central engine for the fr i type jets based on the vla polarimetric observations .",
    "it is interesting to measure the velocity structure of the conical jet .",
    "we also note that the magnetic reconnection can be another possible origin for the in - situ energy dissipation , and future monitoring observation at this region will detect the local time variability associated with this event .",
    "therefore , further observations towards the ngc6251 jet is needed to explore the physical origin of the agn jet structural transition .",
