    "after the work of wilson and others @xcite in the 1970s on the renormalization group ( rg ) in the theory of phase transitions , field theory methods originally employed in high - energy physics became an indispensable tool in theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "indeed , since the seminal work of wilson , many excellent textbooks on field theoretic methods in condensed matter physics appeared , where a variety of other topics are also discussed ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other side",
    ", the use of field theoretic methods in condensed matter physics led to further insights in particle physics .",
    "thus , the study of classical phase transitions in several lattice spin models gave birth to lattice gauge theory ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which provided an approach to numerically tackle the strong - coupling regime of gauge theories .",
    "this interchange of ideas between these two fields became even more intensive after the discovery of high - temperature ( high-@xmath0 ) superconductors , where it became apparent that traditional many - body techniques are insufficient to understand the mechanism behind high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "for instance , gauge theories , both abelian and non - abelian were employed to understand several properties of doped mott insulators @xcite , which eventually may become superconducting upon doping .",
    "these notes have the aim of introducing some field theoretic methods widely used in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions .",
    "classical phase transitions occur at a regime where quantum fluctuations do not play an important role , usually at high enough temperatures . in this case time , as obtained from quantum - mechanical equations of motion , does not play a role .",
    "furthermore , in many situations is possible to use a continuum model hamiltonian , which provides the stage for employing the field theory formalism .",
    "wilson s rg was originally introduced in this context @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians are in this case actually determined by a landau - ginzburg type of expansion @xcite where the free energy is expanded in powers of the order parameter and its derivatives .",
    "the result is similar to lagrangians of quantum field theories in euclidean space , i.e. , a space - time where time is imaginary @xcite .",
    "it is this fact that allows for the application of field theory in the study of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "quantum phases transitions @xcite , on the other hand , occur at zero temperature , such that time becomes important .",
    "the quantum phase transition is usually driven by some dimensionless parameter , like for example the ratio between two couplings appearing in a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "very often the lagrangian for a system undergoing a quantum phase transition resembles one for a classical phase transition , excepts that one of directions of space is the ( imaginary ) time .",
    "thus , when this occurs , the same field theoretic methods employed in the framework of classical phase transitions can be applied in the quantum phase .",
    "sometimes we say in such a context that a quantum system in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath2 spatial dimensions and one time dimension ) is equivalent to a classical system having @xmath1 _ spatial _ dimensions .",
    "thus , if we think of a landau - ginzburg theory , we see that the effective lagrangian of the quantum system has to look relativistic .",
    "there are several non - relativistic condensed matter systems possessing an effective description which is relativistic - like @xcite . here `` effective '' means a field theory description valid at some energy scale where the details of the underlying lattice model are irrelevant .",
    "there are cases , however , where time arises in the effective theory in a way which is not rotational invariant in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "euclidean dimensions . ] in those situations , frequency scales differently from momenta near the critical point , so they differ in scaling by some power @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write the scaling relation @xmath3 at the critical point , which defines the so called dynamic critical exponent , @xmath4 . in this way , we see that a relativistic - like theory will have @xmath5 , so that the results from classical phase transitions can be applied to the quantum case more directly .",
    "we will see in these notes mostly examples of theories having @xmath5 .    in these notes priority",
    "is given to the introduction of calculational methods .",
    "thus , the reader will usually find here very detailed calculations , which are often done step - by - step .",
    "let us start with a very simple example spin dynamics , namely , the interaction of a spin with an external magnetic field . the hamiltonian is    @xmath6    the heisenberg equation of motion for the @xmath7-th spin component yields    @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\gamma[s_i , s_j]b_j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the quantum mechanical commutation relation ,    @xmath9={\\rm i}\\epsilon_{ijk}s_k,\\ ] ]    we obtain immediately ,    @xmath10    or , in vector notation ,    @xmath11    the above equation simply describes the precession of a spin in an external magnetic field .",
    "the above equation can also be obtained from a lagrangian for a _ classical _ spin .",
    "the classical spin is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "in this case we have the lagrangian density ,    @xmath14,\\ ] ]    where the vector functional @xmath15 has to be determined .",
    "this functional plays the role of a `` momentum '' canonically conjugate to @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 would play the role analogous to a term @xmath18 in classical mechanics . in this context , we note that the hamiltonian density @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath20 , which may appear to be a strange feature when compared to the most common situations in classical mechanics",
    ". however , we should not forget that we have a constraint , @xmath13 , which will play an important role in the derivation of the equations of motion .",
    "the equation of motion for each component of the unit vector field @xmath16 is given by the euler - lagrange equation :    @xmath21    thus , we have @xmath22={\\cal a}_i({\\bf n})$ ] , so that ,    @xmath23    we also have ,    @xmath24    altogether we obtain ,    @xmath25    the term between parentheses is an antisymmetric second - rank tensor which is a function of the unit vector @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it should have the form ,    @xmath26    or , equivalently ,    @xmath27    the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ mon ] ) is the @xmath7-th component of the curl of @xmath20 .",
    "we can interpret @xmath20 as a vector potential defined in spin space .",
    "it is actually called the berry vector potential , and the corresponding term in the lagrangian containing @xmath20 , when associated to a functional integral representation of spin systems @xcite , constitutes the so called berry phase .",
    "we will study the berry vector potential further in a while . for the moment , let us proceed by deriving the equation of motion for @xmath16 .",
    "( [ mon ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ prec - a ] , we obtain easily ,    @xmath28    contracting both sides with @xmath29 yields ,    @xmath30    where from the second line to the third we have used both @xmath13 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we have just obtained the desired result , namely ,    @xmath32    thus , once more a precessing vector is obtained , except that this time it is not an operator that is precessing .",
    "( [ ll - bext ] ) is the simplest example of the so called landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation . in order to study the dynamics of ferromagnetic systems",
    ", we have to go beyond the situation of an external magnetic field . to do this , first note that    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    if @xmath35 has a more complicate functional dependence on @xmath16 , involving spatial variations of the unit vector , @xmath36 will be itself a function of @xmath16 , constituting in this way an effective magnetic field .",
    "by assuming spatial isotropy , such a hamiltonian is given by    @xmath37,\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , is the bare spin stiffness .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian above can be motivated via the continuum limit of the lattice spin hamiltonian for a ferromagnet ,    @xmath40    where the lattice spin fields are assumed to be classical vectors , @xmath41 , and the lattice sites are summed over nearest neighbors . indeed , by inserting the lattice fourier transformation    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the number of lattice sites , in the hamiltonian above , we obtain ,    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    and we have set the lattice space equal to unity . in the continuum limit",
    ", we have ,    @xmath46    the second term above contributes to the first term in ( [ h - grad ] ) , while the term @xmath47 just adds an irrelevant constant to the hamiltonian , since    @xmath48    let us consider now the ll equation with an effective field determined by the hamiltonian ( [ h - grad ] ) .",
    "the ll becomes ,    @xmath49    next we set @xmath50 and study small transverse fluctuations around the @xmath51-axis , i.e. ,    @xmath52    where    @xmath53.\\ ] ]    this solution describes a so called spin - wave , whose quanta are known as magnons . by inserting the above spin - wave profile in the ll equation , we see that it solves it provided    @xmath54    which yields the spin - wave spectrum for a ferromagnet .",
    "let us discuss the berry vector potential further .",
    "if we compute the flux of the curl ( in spin space ) of @xmath15 through the unit sphere @xmath55 ( the bar reminds us that @xmath56 is embedded in spin space ) using eq .",
    "( [ mon ] ) , we obtain ,    @xmath57    where we have used the parametrization @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the winding number .",
    "this result shows that the berry vector potential corresponds to the field strength of a magnetic monopole in spin space .",
    "note that this result is supposed to be an intrinsic property of the berry vector potential such that should hold beyond the case of a single spin in an external field .",
    "however , for the case where many spins are involved and have a gradient energy , we have a further topological aspect .",
    "in fact , when @xmath16 has a nonzero gradient , we have the following flux through a sphere @xmath56 _ in real space _ ( note the absence of the bar over @xmath56 and the differences in the integration measure ) ,    @xmath60    we see that the last line of ( [ hedgehog-1 ] ) is twice the second line of ( [ flux - berry ] ) .",
    "thus , we have ,    @xmath61    therefore , we see that there is not only a topological object living in spin space , but there is also one living in real ( three - dimensional ) space , a so called _ hedgehog_. just like the magnetic monopole in spin space , the hedgehog in real space is also a point - like topological object .",
    "these topological objects arise also in two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets , which will be discussed later in these notes .      in order to study the static critical behavior of a ferromagnet",
    ", we can consider just the hamiltonian ( [ h - grad ] ) and try to compute the partition function via the functional integral representation ,    @xmath63    where the @xmath64 function enforces the constraint .",
    "we can rescale the coordinates and the temperature such as to have only @xmath65 as the coefficient of the gradient term @xmath66 and remove the prefactor @xmath38 .",
    "we will also generalize the model such that it will have @xmath2 dimensions and the unit vector field will have @xmath67 components instead of three . in this way , we will be able to consider two approximation schemes , namely , one where an expansion in @xmath68 is made , and another one where the number of components @xmath67 is large , such that an expansion in @xmath69 can be done .",
    "the main idea behind all @xmath70-expansions is to make a perturbative analysis of the problem around the dimensionality where the coupling constant of the model is dimensionless .",
    "in such a case , at the so called critical dimension ( i.e. , the dimension that makes the coupling constant dimensionless ) , perturbation theory is relatively well behaved .",
    "the perturbation series is still divergent and frequently needs to be resummed , especially when higher orders in perturbation theory is involved .",
    "however , rigorous mathematical results exist in some cases where out of some ( initially ) perturbation series a non - perturbative expansion may be rigorously constructed @xcite .",
    "the situation is considerably more difficult if we are not at the critical dimension and the theory approaches the critical point , thus becoming strongly coupled . in these cases",
    "there are several resummation procedures ; for a review on these , with focus on variational perturbation theory , see the textbook by kleinert and schulte - frohlinde @xcite .    for the classical non - linear @xmath62 model ,",
    "the coupling constant is the temperature @xmath71 .",
    "simple dimensional analysis shows that this coupling becomes dimensionless at @xmath72 .",
    "we will show later that for @xmath72 the model is actually asymptotically free .",
    "we are ultimately interested at @xmath73 , so the goal will be to set @xmath74 at the end of the calculations",
    ". the case @xmath72 and @xmath75 is special and will be treated separately in the next chapter .",
    "the calculations will be performed up to second order in the temperature and will serve as a good introduction to the calculation of loop integrals occurring in feynman diagrams .",
    "therefore , we will perform all integrals exactly in @xmath2 dimensions and in great detail below .",
    "simple properties of analytical continuation of the dimension in the integrals will be assumed .",
    "this is known as dimensional regularization .",
    "the properties of dimensional regularization are very simple and are discussed in several textbooks ; see for example ref .",

    "all modes are gapless , so if there is a line of fixed points , like in the kt case , the excitation spectrum is completely gapless along this line . for @xmath362 , on the other hand , debye screening occurs and a gap arises .",

    "we call the result of such an integration @xmath1064 , which is precisely the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath2 dimensions . in this way , we can also write ,    @xmath1065    now we make the change of variables @xmath1066 , such that ,    @xmath1067    where we have used the definition of the gamma function . from eq .",

    "in this appendix we evaluate the following simple @xmath2-dimensional integrals and , at the same time , introduce the method of dimensional regularization of integrals :    @xmath1069    and    @xmath1070    both integrals can be obviously be done in @xmath1071 if an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath188 is introduced . in the limit",

    "let us consider the integral @xmath224 as a function of @xmath900 and @xmath2 , while demanding that it should be cutoff independent .",
    "this can be done by considering @xmath2 somewhere in the complex plane , such that the integral is convergent .",
    "the result of the integration , as a function of @xmath2 , can then be analytically continued in a larger domain ( for more details , see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . in this way , simple dimensional analysis yields    @xmath1073    where @xmath241 is a dimensionless function of @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain similarly for @xmath555 ,    @xmath1074    note that if it is assumed that no cutoff is needed , the only scale available is @xmath900 .",
    "this way of doing things is not always useful and sometimes we may need the explicit cutoff dependence .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ i1 - 1 ] ) implies that @xmath224 vanishes for all @xmath272 if @xmath1075 , which is certainly not true if we regularize the integral with a cutoff .",
    "indeed , if a cutoff is introduced , we have    @xmath1076    thus leading to a positive power of @xmath188 when @xmath272 .",
    "thus , by demanding that @xmath1077 is independent of @xmath188 for all @xmath2 , we obtain that this condition actually imposes    @xmath1078    the above equation is one of the properties required by dimensional regularization .",
    "in fact , an even more general formula should be used , namely ,    @xmath1079    where @xmath1080 .",

    "now we will consider the most general case , i.e. , we will evaluate the integral    @xmath1088    using the identity ( [ ident ] ) , we have ,    @xmath1089    where from the first to the second line we have performed the @xmath2-dimensional gauss integral in @xmath632 and from the second to the third line we made the substitution @xmath1085 . from the third to the last line we used the definition of the gamma function .    of course",
    ", for @xmath1090 and @xmath104 the integral ( [ i - alpha ] ) reproduces the results @xmath224 and @xmath555 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the following integral :    @xmath1091    where @xmath1092 and @xmath1064 is given in appendix [ app : s_d ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath1093 defines the power law for the spectrum of the corresponding bose particle .",

    "( [ int - bec ] ) , we obtain finally ,    @xmath1105",
    "the computation of matsubara sums is a standard method in both relativistic and non - relativistic quantum field theory ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us evaluate here two bosonic matsubara sums frequently used in the text , namaly ,    @xmath1106    and    @xmath1107    where @xmath405 .",
    "although , strictly speaking , the first sum does not converge , it can nevertheless be done using regularization methods . moreover , as we will see , it is related to the second sum , which is convergent .",
    "since @xmath56 is convergent , let us calculate this one first .    .",
    "the red crosses indicate the position of the matsubara modes.,width=377 ]    in order to calculate @xmath56 , we rewrite the sum in terms of a contour integral over an appropriate contour in such a way as to set the sum of the residues at poles given by the matsubara frequency modes .",
    "the two straight lines shown in fig . [ fig : contour - s2 - 1 ] enclose all matsubara modes .",
    "we can imagine a finite number of modes with a closed curve around all of them . in the limit of an infinite number of modes , the closed curve becomes two parallel lines having the matsubara modes between them .",
    "this picture explains why the arrows are pointing the way they do : if to the closed curve a counterclockwise orientation is given , in the limit of an infinite number of matsubara modes the resulting straight line on the right will point upwards , while the one on the left will point downwards .",
    "thus , the sum @xmath56 is equivalent to    @xmath1108    the contour @xmath1109 encloses the poles of the function @xmath1110 , but not the two poles of @xmath1111 . the straight lines @xmath1112 and @xmath1113 can be deformed into the curves @xmath1114 and @xmath1115 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour - s2 - 2 ] without encountering any singularity . note that the deformed contours go clockwise around the poles @xmath1116 , which introduces an extra minus sign .",

    "in contrast to the case of @xmath56 , this sum is related to only one pole at @xmath1119 in the contour integration .",
    "the initial contour is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour - s1 - 1 ] . now by deforming the contours @xmath1112 and @xmath1113 into the new contours @xmath1114 and @xmath1115 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour - s1 - 2 ] , we see that @xmath1115 does not enclose any pole and thus contributes nothing in the evaluation of the sum . therefore , we obtain ,    @xmath1120    .,width=377 ]    the sum @xmath1118 can be related to @xmath56 in the following way ,    @xmath1121    the second term in the second line of the above equation can be thought to vanish , as to every positive term there is a corresponding negative term of identical magnitude .",
    "thus , it seems that we just have to plug the result of the sum @xmath56 into the above result and we are done .",
    "however , this is not quite correct .",
    "the point is that @xmath56 involves two poles , @xmath1116 , corresponding to a `` particle '' and an `` anti - particle '' mode , while @xmath1118 involves just a single pole at @xmath1119 .",
