    "photonic crystals , which are periodic arrangement of dielectric or metallic materials , have attracted a wide attention recently in both physics and engineering communities in view of their unique ability to control light propagation @xcite .",
    "many potential applications of photonic crystals rely on their photonic band gaps ( pbgs ) .",
    "it is thus of great interest to design photonic crystals with an absolute band gap ( as large as possible ) , particularly , for a given dielectric material .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystals have attracted special attention since they are easier to fabricate .",
    "many 2d photonic crystals with large absolute band gaps have been found @xcite .",
    "based on the difference of the filling factors between the dielectric band and the air band ( related to the distribution of the displacement field ) , the rule of thumb sometimes can be used to explain the band gaps particularly at low frequencies @xcite . due to the complication of the differential operators in electrodynamics (",
    "different field components are coupled to each other even if the permittivity @xmath0 is separable ) , it is difficult to obtain analytical ( even approximate ) solutions for the distribution of the displacement field ( particularly at high frequencies ) . therefore , many photonic crystals with large absolute band gaps can not be explained or found by the rule of thumb @xcite .",
    "degeneracy lifting is another explanation for absolute band gaps and even a method to create band gaps @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy can be lifted by e.g. using hexagonal photonic structures @xcite , using anisotropic materials @xcite , breaking the space group symmetry @xcite and changing the dielectric distribution without breaking the space group symmetry @xcite .",
    "both accidental and normal degeneracies can exist in a photonic band structure ( see e.g. @xcite , this is different as compared to an electronic system ) . to investigate the degeneracy properties of 2d photonic crystals ,",
    "the @xmath1-polarization and @xmath2-polarization are usually considered separately as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is very complicated to predict where the degeneracy appears and how to break the degeneracy .    in some cases",
    ", we do nt have to rely on such an analysis . in the present paper ,",
    "we introduce a method to create degeneracies first and then break them to create band gaps by studying the band structure associated with a super cell ( instead of the unit cell as considered in the literature mentioned before by others ) . in the band structure",
    "associated with a super cell , we can analyze how degeneracies are formed and how to break them to create band gaps .",
    "the point group symmetry of a photonic crystal is defined with respect to the point with the highest symmetry .",
    "for example , the point group symmetry does not changed by adding columns at the corners of the unit cell for the 2d photonic crystals considered in @xcite ( they belong to the same point group symmetry @xmath3 ) .",
    "we notice that the translation group symmetry does not change either .",
    "thus the space group symmetry of the photonic crystal does not change at all although the smallest unit cell must include two rods after the additional rods are added .",
    "it may be hard to understand the degeneracy breaking for the @xmath2-polarization at point @xmath4 of the second and third bands as shown in @xcite without careful analysis of the electromagnetic field distribution .",
    "however , if we study the band structure associated with a super cell , the lifting of the degeneracy and the creation of pbgs of such photonic crystals can be understood with some tricks even when the space group symmetry of the photonic crystal does not change . for the example",
    "mentioned above , the photonic crystal with the additional columns at the corners can be treated as the result of changing the translation group symmetry ( keeping the point group symmetry unchanged ) from another photonic crystal with the additional columns having the save size with the original column ( as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) with the square column case ) , which also belongs to @xmath3 point group symmetry ) .",
    "another view is presented to understand the idea of additional columns .",
    "not surprisingly , many known photonic crystal structure such as a chessboard structure @xcite , a square lattice of square rods @xcite and even a triangular air hole structure @xcite can be somehow understood from this point of view .",
    "( cf . the numerical example associated with figs .",
    "3 - 6 below ) . by using such a degeneracy analysis associated with a super cell ,",
    "some structures with large band gaps are also found in the present paper .",
    "a unit cell we consider here refers to the smallest periodic region in a photonic crystal .",
    "if the periodic region includes more than one unit cells , e.g. 2 unit cells , it is called a super cell .",
    "first we want to study the relation between the band structure associated with the super cell and the original band structure ( associated with the unit cell ) .    in general",
    ", we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic crystal with primitive lattice vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the associated primitive reciprocal vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 3d levi - civita completely antisymmetric symbol .",
    "the complete set of the reciprocal lattice vectors is written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are integers .",
    "we denote the first brillouin zone formed by these reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath15 as zone a.    the primitive lattice vectors for a super cell are the linear combinations ( with integer coefficients ) of the primitive lattice vectors for the unit cell , i.e. , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are integers . the corresponding primitive reciprocal vectors for the super cell are determined by @xmath19 . the integers @xmath18 form a @xmath20 transform matrix with a positive determinant @xmath21 .    since @xmath22 it follows from @xmath23 that @xmath24 where the superscript @xmath25 denotes the matrix transposition .",
