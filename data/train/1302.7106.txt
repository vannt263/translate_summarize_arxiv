    "the use of zernike polynomials for representing the aberrations of an optical system is now common and well understood @xcite .",
    "indeed , these polynomials have been proven to form a very convenient basis in applications as diverse as the description of pupil aberrations of the human eye @xcite or the characterization in observational astronomy of the statistics of turbulent aberrations produced by the atmosphere over the telescope aperture @xcite .",
    "when using the zernike basis , the aberrated phase is described as a linear combination of the polynomials , the value of the coefficients being related to the aperture on which the phase is defined . when this aperture undergoes geometrical transformations such as scaling , translation and rotation , the zernike coefficients corresponding to the transformed aperture can be computed from proper linear combinations of the original ones by finding the transformation matrix associated to these linear applications .",
    "+ in that matter , if many solutions have been proposed for pure pupil scaling , see e.g. @xcite , only a few authors have tackled the three linear transformations altogether in a unified method .",

    "+ in this paper we propose an alternative technique based on the fourier transform properties of the zernike polynomials .",
    "we provide analytical and exact formulas that allow the computation of the transformation matrix in all cases of scaling / translation / rotation of the pupil . in the hypothesis of a full aperture without central obstruction",
    ", we develop the results in terms of integrals of a product of two or three bessel functions .",

    "<S> the technique is based on the properties of zernike polynomials fourier transform and , in the case of a full aperture without central obstruction , the coefficients of the matrix are given in terms of integrals of bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> the integral formulas are exact and do not depend on any specific ordering of the polynomials . </S>"
