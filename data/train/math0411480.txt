    "surfaces of constant mean curvature @xmath0 in hyperbolic space have attracted much attention since bryant s fundamental paper @xcite .",
    "they are nowadays called bryant surfaces .",
    "bryant surfaces are the hyperbolic analogue to minimal surfaces in euclidean space , because their gauss  mainardi  codazzi equations are virtually the same .",
    "this leads to a local correspondence between euclidean minimal and bryant surfaces which is known as the cousin relation .",
    "similar to euclidean minimal surfaces which are characterized by the holomorphicity of their gauss map , bryant surfaces are characterized by the holomorphicity of their hyperbolic gauss map .",
    "in contrast to the euclidean minimal case , the hyperbolic gauss map of a complete finite total curvature bryant surface may not extend through the ends .",
    "the ends at which the hyperbolic gauss map extends holomorphically are called regular ends , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "smooth bryant ends in hyperbolic space are a direct analog to planar minimal ends in euclidean space : both extend to immersions through the ideal boundary of the space form , i.e. , the 2sphere or the point at infinity , respectively .",
    "we show that a bryant end is smooth if and only if its bryant representation @xmath5 is a holomorphic null immersion of the punctured disc into @xmath6 with a pole at the puncture such that @xmath7 has a second order pole .",
    "in other words , a smooth bryant end is a regular end which is @xmath8reducible @xcite ( i.e. , the representation @xmath5 has no monodromy ) such that @xmath7 has a second order pole .",
    "the proof is based on a theorem of collin , hauswirth , and rosenberg @xcite according to which a properly embedded bryant annular end is regular .",
    "the corresponding characterization in the euclidean case is that a minimal end is planar if and only if it is the real part of a holomorphic null immersion into @xmath9 with a simple pole at the end . in the case of bryant surfaces",
    "there are two types of smooth ends : those asymptotic to horospheres and those asymptotic to smooth catenoid cousins in the sense of @xcite . at a smooth horospherical end",
    "@xmath5 has a simple pole and @xmath7 automatically has a second order pole . at a smooth catenoidal end",
    "@xmath5 has a pole of higher order .",
    "besides the cousin relation there is another correspondence between bryant surfaces and euclidean minimal surfaces : if one interprets @xmath6 as an affine representation of the complex 3quadric @xmath10 and @xmath9 as stereographic projection of @xmath11 then both types of surfaces are represented by holomorphic null immersions into @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath11valued representation of a smooth bryant end or a planar euclidean minimal end extends to an _ immersion _ through the end . in case of smooth horospherical bryant ends and euclidean minimal",
    "planar ends the holomorphic null immersion transversally intersects the corresponding hyperplane at infinity . in case of smooth catenoidal",
    "bryant ends the intersection is non  transversal .",
    "the analogy goes further if one considers the willmore energy of surfaces in the conformal 3sphere @xmath12 ( see the appendix for the relation of the willmore energy and the total absolute curvature ) .",
    "as proven by bryant  @xcite , all complete finite total curvature minimal surfaces with planar ends in @xmath13 extend to compact willmore surfaces in @xmath3 , i.e. , critical points of the willmore energy , and all willmore _ spheres _ in @xmath3 are obtained this way .",
    "bryant surfaces with smooth ends are not willmore , but constrained willmore  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they obey the same quantization of the willmore energy as euclidean minimal surfaces with planar ends : in both cases the willmore energy is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total pole order of the corresponding null curve in @xmath6 or @xmath9 , respectively . as in the case of euclidean minimal spheres with planar ends  @xcite , the possible willmore energies of bryant _ spheres _ with smooth ends are @xmath16 . in particular , we show that bryant spheres with exactly @xmath17 horospherical smooth ends exist if and only if @xmath18 .",
    "there is no restriction on the number of ends if one allows for catenoidal ends : we give explicit rational conformal parametrizations for spheres with an arbitrary number of smooth ends .",
    "we were led to consider bryant surfaces with smooth ends during our investigations of soliton spheres @xcite when we observed that the simplest non  trivial dirac sphere @xcite , a surface of revolution related to a 1soliton solution of the mkdv equation  @xcite , is a catenoid cousin with smooth ends , see figure  [ fig : dirac1 ] .",
    "we prove that all bryant spheres with smooth ends are soliton spheres .",
    "the analogous result that all euclidean minimal spheres with planar ends are soliton spheres is proven in  @xcite .    in the last section we give a uniform mbius geometric characterization of complete euclidean minimal surfaces with finite total curvature and planar ends and compact bryant surfaces with smooth ends in terms of bryant s quartic differential  @xmath4 :",
    "we show that @xmath4 vanishes identically for an immersion of a compact surface into @xmath3 if and only if it is the compactification of either a euclidean minimal surface with planar ends or a compact bryant surface with smooth ends .",

    "jeromin , and wayne rossmann for helpful discussions .",
    "the unit 3ball @xmath19 with the metric @xmath20 is the poincar ball model of hyperbolic 3space . a surface in @xmath21",
    "is called a _ bryant surface _ if it has constant mean curvature one .",

    "although the ball model of hyperbolic space is best suited for the definition of smooth ends , the investigation of the ends turns out to be much simpler in the half space model @xmath30 with the metric @xmath31 . in the half space model the bryant surface corresponding to a holomorphic null immersion @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 these formulas may be derived from by applying the orientation preserving isometry : @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",

    "we prove now that the bryant representation of a smooth end is well defined on the punctured unit disc @xmath44 and has a pole at zero . the proof is based on a result of collin , hauswirth , and rosenberg  @xcite about the behavior of the holomorphic null immersion @xmath5 corresponding to a properly embedded bryant annular end .",
