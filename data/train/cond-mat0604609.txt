    "systems with triangular lattice structure have been a source of attention mostly due to the frustration effects resulting from their non - bipartite structure . as a result of the competition between the frustration and strong electron correlations",
    ", these systems exhibit a wide range of exotic phases .",
    "recent studies of the metal - insulator transition , superconductivity , and antiferromagnetism in the organic compounds @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5x with x as an anion @xcite , discovery of superconductivity in na@xmath6coo@xmath5.yh@xmath5o,@xcite and the recent discovery of the mott transitions in 0.33 monolayers of sn on ge(111 ) at @xmath7 k,@xcite as a few examples , underline the importance of these systems and their physics .",
    "theoretical work has been dedicated to the discovery of the magnetically ordered phases in the ground state of the hubbard and @xmath8 models on triangular lattices as a function of the on - site electron - electron coulomb interaction @xmath2 at different fillings.@xcite unlike the square lattice at half - filling , which is a mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order at arbitrarily small values of @xmath9 , the ground state of a triangular lattice has a variety of magnetically ordered and disordered phases .",
    "this is due to the lack of perfect nesting in the non - interacting fermi surface of a triangular lattice at half - filling .    for triangular lattices , according to the hartree - fock calculations of krishnamurthy and co - workers , @xcite the mott transition occurs from a paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator at half - filling for values of @xmath2 larger than the band width @xmath10 .",
    "a variety of the physical properties of the triangular lattices including tendencies towards superconductivity within the small to intermediate @xmath2 regime have been studied at finite temperature using correlated electron approaches which go beyond mean field theory , such as the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex)@xcite or one - loop renormalization - group.@xcite however , when @xmath11 , a more powerful cluster solving technique such as the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is required to accurately describe the phase transition .",
    "finite size lattice determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) has already been employed for triangular and kagom lattices.@xcite unfortunately , the finite size lattice qmc method incurs sign problems at both low temperatures and away from half - filling .",
    "in addition , due to the finite size nature of the problem , the non - local correlations are always overestimated and the system consisting of a finite size cluster becomes an insulator as soon as the correlation length reaches the size of the lattice at low enough @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the gaps or pseudogaps are also overestimated and are not guaranteed to persist as one reaches the thermodynamic limit.@xcite however , finite size effects can be reduced by size scaling and in general become less important as @xmath2 increases .    in this work ,",
    "we employ the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite to study the mott transition for the hubbard model on a triangular lattice at half - filling .",
    "dmft describes systems in the thermodynamic limit and at the same time suppresses the physics due to the non - local correlations through coarse - graining over all momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , susceptibilities can diverge , as in the thermodynamic limit but the mott gap in the strong - coupling regime is always smaller than its counterpart given by a finite size lattice approach .",
    "the combination of the dmft and qmc also does not incur sign problems at either low temperatures or any fillings which makes the low temperature physics more accessible and reliable .",
    "dmft is a more suitable approximation for the triangular lattice systems as opposed to those with square lattice structure .",
    "for instance , dmft is incapable of describing the metal - insulator transition on the square lattice in the weak coupling regime .",
    "this is a consequence of the suppression of the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations responsible for this transition at small @xmath2 by the single site nature of dmft.@xcite however , in triangular lattices , due to the frustration of the lattice structure , even in the presence of non - local correlations , the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations are greatly suppressed . as a result , heavy quasiparticles form at the fermi energy reminiscent of the dmft physics.@xcite    dmft has already been employed for studying triangular lattices using the exact diagonalization and lanczos techniques.@xcite in this paper , we present for the first time , the combination of dmft and qmc for solving the hubbard model at half - filling on a triangular lattice . by computing the density of states at different values of interaction @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3",
    ", we estimate the value of the critical interaction for the mott transition to be @xmath12 , less than the predicted value of @xmath13 in ref .  , but , as expected , larger than the mean field result .",
    "in addition , the mott transition features are also manifest in the evolution of the magnetic moment , total internal energy and the specific heat as functions of on - site interaction @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the repulsive hubbard model on a triangular lattice ,    @xmath14    with @xmath1 the hopping amplitude , @xmath15 the chemical potential and @xmath2 the on - site coulomb interaction between the electrons of opposite spins residing on lattice site @xmath16 . note that unlike the square lattice , on a triangular lattice , due to the lack of particle - hole symmetry , @xmath17 does not yield half - filling .",
    "also , this model exhibits quite different physics under the change of the sign of @xmath1 , especially away from half - filling .",
    "the dispersion in the @xmath18 limit including the nearest neighbor hopping only is , @xmath19\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting noninteracting density of states is markedly asymmetric about @xmath20 , extending from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , with a van hove singularity at @xmath23 .    the dmft approach to tight binding hamiltonians starts by coarse - graining the green s function , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matsubara fermionic frequency and @xmath26 the local self - energy for spin @xmath27 .",
    "note that the self - energy @xmath26 in dmft is local ( momentum independent ) . in the first dmft cycle iteration",
    ", we chose @xmath28 .",
    "the bath green s function is then computed , @xmath29 @xmath30 is used as an input to the qmc solver .",
    "our dmft - qmc solver is based on the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite in which the interacting two - body term in the hubbard model is decomposed into two one - body density terms coupled to a hubbard - stratonovich field . through the stochastic averaging over the most probable configurations of these ising like fields , one calculates the fully interacting green s function on a single site of a lattice @xmath31 .",
    "the local self - energy @xmath26 is then calculated from the full and bath green s functions @xmath31 and @xmath30 respectively , @xmath32 this self - energy is again inserted in eq.[eq : green - cg ] , and the self - consistent process continues until convergence .",
    "the final product of the dmft - qmc cycle is the full green s function in imaginary time @xmath33 which is used to compute the density of states ( dos ) @xmath34 ,    @xmath35    @xmath34 must be calculated by inverting eq.[eq : gtau ] , which is an ill - posed problem due to the statistical errors in @xmath33 from the qmc simulations .",
    "this task in this paper is done by using the maximum entropy ( maxent ) analytical continuation technique developed by jarrell and gubernatis.@xcite this technique is based on bayesian inference in which an entropy function with respect to an original default model is defined as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the best @xmath34 is the one that maximizes this entropy function for a given @xmath33 .",
    "we also present results for the double occupation , @xmath36 which is suppressed by the on - site repulsion .",
    "the double occupation is related to the magnetic moment , @xmath37    the total internal energy can also be computed in this formalism in terms of the full green s function and double occupation : @xmath38e^{i\\omega_n0^{+}}+ud\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath39 defined as in eq.[eq : dbleoccp ] .",
    "eq.[eq : int - eng ] is equivalent to the galitskii - migdal expression for the total internal energy.@xcite the specific heat at constant volume is @xmath40 as seen later in this article , the variation of the total internal energy and specific heat as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 will exhibit features reflecting the mott metal - insulator phase transition .",
    "before presenting our data for the density of states , we comment on some of the details of the maximum entropy procedure , since careful characterization of the data is essential to obtain reliable results . in this work",
    ", the dmft - qmc cycle as described in section [ sec : formalism ] converges at a desired tolerance which is about few percent for the time green s function @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical potential is also adjusted simultaneously to keep the total occupation at half - filling . for",
    "the qmc runs , we adopt the criterion @xmath41 with @xmath42 for finding @xmath43 , the number of the time slices .",
    "@xmath43 can be small at high temperatures , however , even for temperatures as high as the bandwidth , we choose the lower limit of @xmath44 . the number of the lattice sweeps for the qmc runs varies between @xmath45 to @xmath46 depending on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the reliability of the maxent results .",
    "the outputs of the cycle are the fully interacting time green s function , the magnetic moment on a single site and total internal energy for the temperature and interaction at which the qmc cycle has been running .",
    "the full @xmath33 is employed to calculate the dos through eq.[eq : gtau ] using the maxent technique .",
    "@xcite    care must be taken when using maxent as the results can strongly depend on the quality of the qmc data .",
    "maxent , as described in ref .",
    ", requires statistically independent and gaussianly distributed measurements of @xmath33 for every time slice @xmath47 from qmc .",
    "both these two properties are often lacking in the @xmath33 data initially obtained from the qmc output because of the presence of correlations between the measurements .",
    "the solution is a careful rebinning of the @xmath33 data which eliminates these correlations and yields gaussianly distributed data .",
    "correlations between different time slices are also eliminated in the maxent code by diagonalizing a covariance matrix coupling different time slices together.@xcite    the other concern is a proper choice for the maxent default model . in general , for good qmc data , the choice of the default model should not change the qualitative features of the spectral function significantly . among the available default models ,",
    "the gaussian and second order perturbation models have been most commonly utilized . in our work , we adopt the latter and perform the so called annealing method in which we start with the second - order perturbation theory default model at a high temperature close to the band width .",
    "we then use the maxent output for that temperature as the default model for a slightly lower temperature and continue until we arrive at the lowest desired @xmath3 .",
    "finally , as introduced in ref .  , there are different methods of doing the maxent including the historic , classic and bryan .",
    "we utilized both classic and bryan techniques in our calculations and found that both these two methods give qualitatively similar results .    .",
    "for clarity , the base lines have been shifted in steps of @xmath48 for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath49 line determines the location of the fermi energy .",
    "three behaviors are visible : at weak coupling the density of states has a finite value at @xmath49 . at large coupling the density of states vanishes , signaling the opening of the mott insulating gap . at intermediate coupling the density of states",
    "exhibits a kondo resonance at @xmath49 .",
    ", width=307 ]    in fig.[dos.evolve ] , we present the evolution of the dos as a function of @xmath2 at low temperatures . at @xmath18 , the dos shows a van hove singularity near @xmath50 .",
    "as the interaction is gradually turned on , there is an overall broadening of the density of states , including a smearing out of the van hove singularity .",
    "the dos at @xmath51 and @xmath52 exhibits the onset of the abrikosov - suhl ( kondo ) resonance in which there appears a sharp quasi - particle peak near the fermi energy with two shoulders , the upper and lower hubbard bands , around it . for @xmath53 and @xmath52 , the peak lines up with the fermi energy and shoulders",
    "are approximately located at @xmath54 . at @xmath55 , and @xmath56",
    ", we clearly observe a different trend in which the kondo resonance is absent and the dos has a pronounced minimum at the fermi surface , indicating that the system has been driven to the metal - insulator transition regime . for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , the ( mott ) gap is well established and the system becomes an insulator .     at half - filling and different temperatures . as the temperature",
    "is lowered a sharp kondo resonance develops at @xmath49 .",
    "the system is metallic .",
    "panel ( b ) : the same results as for panel ( a ) for @xmath55 .",
    "the system is on the verge of insulating behavior .",
    "panel ( c ) : @xmath57 .",
    "a mott gap has opened at @xmath58.,width=268 ]     at half - filling .",
    "@xmath59 drops down close to its minimum @xmath60 at large temperatures ( cut off in this figure ) . the comparison between the dqmc and dmft at @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "is also presented .",
    "the inset shows how @xmath63 , the temperature for the maximum @xmath59 , drops as @xmath2 increases.,width=326 ]    to better address the role played by temperature in the metal - insulator transition , in fig.[dos.compare ] the dos for three values of @xmath53 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and different temperatures have been plotted . at @xmath53 ,",
    "as @xmath3 decreases , the dos evolves towards a sharp abrikosov - suhl resonant quasi - particle peak .",
    "however , @xmath55 exhibits a completely different trend .",
    "as the temperature drops , the dos evolves towards the opening of a gap . at @xmath56",
    ", we noticed that the maxent results are of less reliability due to the correlations in the qmc data which could not be totally removed up to @xmath66 qmc lattice sweeps by rebinning the data .",
    "( it is , of course , typical of monte carlo simulations that statistical fluctuations are largest near phase transitions ) this is additional evidence that @xmath55 is close to the critical value for the opening of a gap but we were not able to determine conclusively whether the gap exists at @xmath55 if one can reach low enough temperatures . on the other hand , by the time @xmath57 ( at @xmath58 ) , the maxent results show a pronounced mott gap in the dos .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the critical value of @xmath67 must lie very close to @xmath55 , leading to our estimate @xmath68 .",
    "this value is smaller than the value @xmath69 obtained in ref .   using the dmft with exact diagonalization and lanczos techniques as the impurity solvers , and comparable to @xmath70 in ref .   with exact diagonalization on @xmath71 site lattices .",
    "at both values of @xmath55 and @xmath65 , we also observe the appearance of a feature on the right hand side of @xmath49 .",
    "this feature is likely a remnant of the peak in the non - interacting density of states it disappears as @xmath2 is increased to larger values and is completely absent for @xmath72 .",
    "another signature of the metal - insulator ( mott ) transition is manifest in the behavior of the magnetic moment defined in eq.[eq : magmom ] as a function of temperature @xmath3 and interaction @xmath2 . as shown in fig.[mag - mom - t ] , for small to intermediate values of @xmath2",
    ", @xmath59 reaches a maximum at a value of @xmath63 which is characteristic of a fermi - liquid dominated by spin fluctuations at low temperatures.@xcite at low temperatures with an entropy of @xmath73 per particle , a fermi liquid gains free energy upon heating by trying to localize the electrons in order to take advantage of a larger spin entropy.@xcite the inset in fig.[mag - mom - t ] shows how @xmath63 decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "however , at the onset of the mott transition , @xmath59 becomes a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath3 as seen in fig .",
    "[ mag - mom - t ] for @xmath55 and @xmath65 . in a localized mott phase ,",
    "the spin entropy at @xmath74 is finite and the system can not gain free energy by further localizing the electrons upon heating .",
    "comparison has also been made between dqmc on a @xmath75 finite size lattice and dmft in fig.[mag - mom - t ] for values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the agreement between the two approaches is very close at @xmath61 down to @xmath76 .",
    "however , for @xmath51 , at low temperatures , the dqmc approach exhibits a rather flat region for @xmath59 below @xmath77 in place of the downward curve in dmft .",
    "this flat feature is similar to what is observed at larger values of @xmath2 in dmft as a precursor to the insulating phase .",
    "this is typical of any finite size lattice approach such as dqmc in which at low enough temperatures , once the correlation length exceeds the size of the lattice , the system turns insulating . in the dmft , on the other hand , the system is in the thermodynamic limit and therefore , the insulating phase features do not appear except at large enough interaction @xmath2 values . nevertheless , dqmc has the advantage of including the non - local correlations which are ignored in dmft .",
    "these correlations work in favor of the gap formation .",
    "thus , dmft overestimates the value of @xmath2 for the formation of the gap in the mott transition .",
    "the evolution of the total internal energy and specific heat defined in eq.[eq : int - eng ] and eq.[eq : spec - heat ] respectively also exhibits signatures of a metal - insulator phase transition at large interaction @xmath2 values and low temperatures @xmath3 . in fig.[thermodynamics ] , panel ( a ) , the total internal energy has been plotted as a function of temperature @xmath3 for different values of interaction @xmath2 .",
    "we have employed a polynomial fitting procedure developed by duffy and moreo @xcite and obtained the curves presented in panel ( b ) . by analytically differentiating the polynomial fits with respect to temperature ,",
    "we arrive at results for the specific heat plotted in panel ( c ) . for values of @xmath61 to @xmath78 , we observe a two - peak structure in the @xmath79 consistent with the results in ref .   for the infinite dimensional and @xmath80 hypercubic hubbard models respectively .",
    "the peak at low temperatures corresponds to the local spin fluctuations analogous to the formation of the kondo singlets in the kondo model .",
    "it is also a signature for the validity of the fermi liquid picture as it indicates the existence of a conducting electron bath around the magnetic impurity.@xcite the upper peak at high temperatures , however , corresponds to on - site charge fluctuations .",
    "separation between these two peaks occurs at @xmath61 and develops up to @xmath51 resulting in a sharp lower peak .    as prescribed in ref .",
    ", the lower and higher temperature segments of @xmath81 have been fit with two different polynomials which meet around @xmath82 .",
    "this prescription explains the rather sharp feature in the @xmath79 curve at @xmath61 in fig.[thermodynamics ] , panel ( c ) , around @xmath83 .",
    "however , the necessity of using two polynomials originates in the existence of two separate temperature regions , one dominated by spin and the other by charge fluctuations . the lower peak dwindles at @xmath53 as a sign of approaching the insulating phase.@xcite it is also striking that , similar to the result of ref .",
    ", within the fermi liquid range up to @xmath53 , all @xmath79 curves more or less intersect at the same temperature close to @xmath84 .",
    "the picture however is different at @xmath57 when the insulating phase sets in .",
    "the lower peak completely vanishes and the @xmath79 curve goes to zero at a finite value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of @xmath79 in the presence of a gap @xmath85 going as @xmath86 at low temperatures , and having a broad peak at high temperatures resulting from charge fluctuations in the upper hubbard band.@xcite for @xmath55 , @xmath87 results were too noisy to be conclusive and therefore are not presented .",
    "this was apparently due to @xmath55 being close to the critical @xmath67 which made it difficult to achieve convergence in the simulation .",
    "lastly , fig.[eint - t - comp ] presents a comparison between dmft and dqmc for @xmath81 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "similar to the trend observed for @xmath59 in fig.[mag - mom - t ] , at high enough @xmath3 , the agreement betweeen the two approaches is clearly manifest in the results . for @xmath61 at low @xmath3 , dqmc exhibits an insulating phase feature in the rather flat tail of the @xmath88 curve near @xmath89 , typical of a finite size approach as discussed earlier . for @xmath51",
    ", however , the effect of non - local correlations becomes more important and at the same time , finite size effects diminish .",
    "hence , dqmc features may be more realistic in showing insulating phase signatures .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath51 is still below the bandwidth @xmath10 and we do not expect to have entered the insulating phase as yet . unfortunately , mostly due to the sign problem in dqmc , attempts in going to lower temperatures and higher @xmath2 values have not yet been successful .",
    "thus , it is not clear to us which approach more plausibly describes the physics for the intermediate value of @xmath51 .     for different values of interaction @xmath2 including the error bars .",
    "panel ( b ) : polynomial fits to data in panel ( a ) . panel ( c ) : the specific heat as a function of temperature @xmath3 for different values of interaction @xmath2 taken by analytical differentiation of polynomials in panel ( b ) .",
    ", width=288 ]     finite size lattice for the total internal energy versus temperature @xmath3 for interaction values of @xmath61 and @xmath62.,width=297 ]    in order to bring the dqmc and dmft treatments into full agreement , it would be necessary to extrapolate both to a zero value of the discretization size of the inverse temperature @xmath90 and also to extrapolate dqmc and dmft to infinite spatial cluster size and full momentum resolution ( the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) ) , respectively .",
    "in summary , we have performed the first implementation of the dmft using qmc as the solver for the half - filled triangular lattice hubbard model .",
    "our approach confirms the previous predictions that for large enough @xmath91 , there is a metal - insulator ( mott ) phase transition from a paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator at finite temperature .",
    "we demonstrate this phase transition by presenting the behavior of the dos , magnetic moment on a single site , total internal energy and specific heat as functions of the interaction @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 .",
    "our results suggest a critical value of interaction @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent with the value @xmath70 from exact diagonalization on @xmath71 site lattices @xcite and @xmath69 from dmft with exact diagonalization and lanczos impurity solvers.@xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the intermediate interacting regime which is characterized by the presence of an abrikosov - suhl ( kondo ) resonance .",
    "dmft is a more suitable approximation for studying the mott transition on a triangular lattice compared to a square lattice .",
    "the reason is that in a triangular lattice , due to the frustration of the lattice structure , the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations are suppressed and do not play a major role in the metal - insulator transition at small @xmath2.@xcite hence , neglecting these correlations , as done by dmft , should still give us a qualitatively correct physical picture at least in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the combination of the dmft and qmc also does not encounter the difficulties related to the sign problem at low temperatures and away from half - filling and also finite size effects associated with dqmc at low @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the low temperature physics is better described by the dmft due to being in the thermodynamic limit . nevertheless , dqmc has the advantage of incorporating non - local correlations which act in favor of gap formation and dmft overestimates the value of @xmath67 because of lacking these correlations .    due to the single site nature of the dmft , we were not able to address the physics of magnetically ordered phases for triangular lattices as one approaches the @xmath89 limit .",
    "these studies have already been performed using the dqmc techniques.@xcite however , the combination of the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) and qmc @xcite can also be considered a promising future candidate for these studies as a complementary approach to dqmc .",
