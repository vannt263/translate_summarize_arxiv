    "the coulomb potential is responsible for the appearance of the bound states of oppositely charged particles .",

    "the potential will be different from the coulomb one but the deviations are usually small . in the presence of the external fields",
    "these corrections can be enhanced .",
    "it is well known that vacuum polarization in one loop is enhanced by an external magnetic field ( proportional to magnetic field @xmath1 ) .",
    "it was discovered by shabad and usov @xcite that this enhancement leads to the significant modification ( screening ) of the coulomb potential for @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron mass and charge , so @xmath5 where @xmath6 . ] .",
    "they calculated the potential in cylindrical geometry ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) numerically for @xmath10 with arbitrary @xmath7 and for @xmath11 with arbitrary @xmath9 ( the pointlike charge is located at @xmath12 and magnetic field is directed along @xmath9 axis ) and found asymptotics analytically .",
    "interpolation ( but still quite accurate ) formula for the polarization operator in a superstrong magnetic field was suggested by vysotsky @xcite . with the help of this formula the potential for @xmath10 ( arbitrary @xmath7 ) and for @xmath11 ( arbitrary @xmath9 ) was calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "it was found @xcite that for @xmath13 the equipotential lines are ellipses , though the potential in the mid - range distances , @xmath14 , was still unknown . in fig . 1 in @xcite",
    "the equipotential lines were approximated by ellipses everywhere .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find out what happens with the potential at mid - range distances . to do",
    "that we evaluate the modified potential numerically .",
    "the equipotential lines at distances @xmath15 turn out to be `` eye - shaped '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lines_1e4 ] , [ fig : lines_1e5 ] ) rather than elliptic .",
    "it means that the potential diminishes with @xmath7 faster than it was expected earlier . such result should be important for problems with the distributed charges , e.g. for the calculation of energy levels in the field of a nucleus with the finite radius .",
    "in section [ sec : analytical ] we reproduce basic formulae from @xcite . in section [ sec : numerical ] we present the results of numerical calculations .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us briefly describe current analytical results on the modified potential . in the presence of an external superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) the contribution of vacuum polarization at one loop level to the polarization operator becomes greatly enhanced @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the momentum of the external photon , @xmath19 and @xmath20 here we took into account only lowest landau level ( lll ) contribution into polarization operator which should dominate .",
    "contributions from higher loops are also omitted in what follows . with these approximations",
    "we follow @xcite where the arguments in favour of this approximation can be found .",
    "since the polarization operator enters the photon propagator , it leads to the modification of the pointlike charge potential ( we consider elementary charge @xmath4 ) : @xmath21    after integration over the angle in the plane transverse to the magnetic field the following result was obtained @xcite ( up to units and notations ) : @xmath22    in @xcite the interpolation formula for @xmath23 was introduced : @xmath24 it is rather simple and allows to perform analytical calculations , but at the same time it provides a very good accuracy ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "using formula ( [ eq : interpolation ] ) the analytical expressions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 were found @xcite ( see also asymptotics in @xcite ) : @xmath27 and for @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    the potential at large distances , @xmath13 , was found in @xcite : @xmath31 which means that potential lines at large distances are ellipses .",
    "the equipotential lines were shown in fig . 1 in @xcite where they were found with the help of ( [ eq : phi_z ] ) , ( [ eq : phi_rho ] ) , and ( [ eq : phi_far ] ) .",
    "the equipotential lines were supposed to be ellipses everywhere .",
    "the aim of this paper is to lift this assumption and to calculate initial integral  ( [ eq : full ] ) in all space numerically .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we want to calculate the potential numerically with the maximum achievable precision . in order to do that one should calculate ( [ eq : full ] ) .",
    "but the integral has a singularity at @xmath32 and therefore it is not really suitable for numerical evaluation .",
    "this singularity has exact physical meaning and it is due to singularity in unmodified coulomb potential , so we subtract @xmath33 from the integral to regularize it .",
    "the coulomb potential can be represented in the form same to ( [ eq : full ] ) but without @xmath34 in the denominator .",
    "therefore the difference is @xmath35 this expression is finite for any @xmath7 and @xmath9 though for numerical integration some additional regularizations are required .",
    "the expression for t(t ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) , should be expanded into series for small @xmath36 , and the numerator and denominator under the integral should be divided by @xmath37 for small @xmath38 .",
    "numerically we integrate in two steps : first integration over @xmath39 is taken with the help of gnu scientific library @xcite , second integration over @xmath40 , the fourier transform , is provided by the fftw package @xcite .",
    "we carefully estimated the errors of the integrations : the final result absolute error for @xmath41 is less than @xmath42 for any @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath43 the error is less than @xmath44 .",
    "our numerical results are in a good agreement with numerical results for @xmath25 and @xmath26 obtained in @xcite .    evaluating this exact integral we can check the precision of analytical estimations . with ( [ eq : phi_z ] )",
    "we obtain the analytical estimate for @xmath45 : @xmath46 for @xmath41 we get @xmath47 .",
    "the numerical value of exact integration is 4.41692858 .",
    "we see that at this point the analytical solution is quiet close to the numerical one .",
    "this agreement is further confirmed in fig . [",
    "fig : phi_z ] , where both numerical and analytical results are shown for @xmath25 .",
    "one can see a very good agreement between numerical and analytical results for any @xmath9 .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : lines_1e5_center ] .",
    "we see that outer equipotential line has elliptic shape while inner lines are `` eye - shaped '' rather than elliptic .",
    "it means that the modified potential of the pointlike charge diminishes with @xmath7 faster than it was expected from previous studies .",
    "if we consider the nucleus with finite radius instead of the pointlike charge , we obtain that the potential magnitude along @xmath11 line will be smaller for mid - range distances , @xmath49 , than in the case of elliptic lines ( since the contribution to the potential from the charges dislocated from @xmath11 will be smaller ) .",
    "it can be easily seen in the following configuration : let us consider the charge distributed along the ring @xmath50 in the @xmath10 plane",
    ". in this case the potential along @xmath9 axis ( @xmath11 ) will be the same as the pointlike charge potential along @xmath51 line .",
    "since the pointlike charge potential diminishes with @xmath7 faster than in the case of elliptic lines , it proves the claim from above .",
    "let us consider an electron in the field of a nucleus with a finite size in the presence of a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "the electron is localized in the direction transverse to the magnetic field at distances @xmath52 .",
    "when the magnetic field is so strong that @xmath53 gets smaller than the nucleus size , the charge distribution becomes important .",
    "as we have shown above the potential is weaker than it was expected .",
    "it means that energy levels in the field of such a nucleus will be higher .",
    "the detailed investigation of this problem is a subject for a separate study .",
    "the paper considers the coulomb potential in a superstrong external magnetic field . due to the enhancement of loop corrections",
    "the potential is modified ( screened ) .",
    "the results for these corrections were known from previous studies , but not in the whole space . in this paper",
    "we calculated numerically the modified potential in all space . with the help of numerical results we estimated the precision of analytical results and obtained some new features .",

    "[ fig : lines_1e4 ] , [ fig : lines_1e5 ] .",
    "it means that potential diminishes with @xmath7 faster than it was expected from previous studies .",
