    "dewetting , the process by which a thin film breaks up into droplets , is a non - equilibrium process driven by the reduction of the total energy .",
    "a large number of recent experimental studies have been devoted to the analysis of the dewetting of ultra - thin solid films@xcite .",
    "the main mass transport process during dewetting is surface diffusion .",
    "however , early work from srolovitz and safran@xcite on solid dewetting have already pointed out the role of sublimation , which can not be avoided at high temperatures .",
    "these authors have discussed the case of sublimation directly from the film to the vapor . here",
    ", we discuss the regime where atoms from the film diffuse on the substrate , and may evaporate when they are on the substrate .",
    "further motivation of the present study comes from recent work on the dewetting of soi systems ( si / sio@xmath0 ) , which have revealed the presence of reaction of si on the substrate ( with subsequent sublimation of the products formed in the reaction ) @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenon could be modeled by a simple sublimation rate to a first approximation , neglecting the substrate shape changes induced by the etching related to the reaction .",
    "in addition , sublimation could also be relevant for the dewetting of metallic films where the temperature can be raised close to the melting temperature@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we analyze the detailed dynamics of dewetting with the possibility for atoms to leave the film , diffuse on the substrate , and evaporate .",
    "we perform kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations , and provide a model inspired from that of ref.@xcite , which is in good agreement with kmc simulation results .",
    "we show that substrate evaporation leads to a novel dynamical regime where the film edge velocity is approximately constant .",
    "in addition , the rim width exhibits an unexpected non - monotonous behavior in time , reaching a maximum value at some intermediate stage .",
    "we model the dewetting of a crystalline film using a solid - on - solid model on a 2d square lattice . the substrate is flat and frozen , and is associated to height @xmath1 , whereas the film has local height @xmath2 .",
    "the local height will change as atoms diffuse or evaporate .",
    "there is no incoming flux of atoms in this model .",
    "an atom at the surface can hop to nearest neighbor sites with rates @xmath3 , when it is not in direct contact with the substrate , and @xmath4 when it is in contact with the substrate ( @xmath5 ) . in our model",
    "an atom has to break all its bonds to hop .",
    "the hopping barrier is therefore given by the binding energy of the atom .",
    "an isolated atom over the substrate can also evaporate with rate @xmath6 . then : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an attempt frequency , @xmath9 is the temperature ( in units with @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the number of in - plane nearest neighbors of the atom before the hop , @xmath12 is the lateral bond energy between two atoms in the film , @xmath13 is the vertical bond energy between two atoms in the film , @xmath14 is the energy barrier for desorption of an atom in contact with the substrate and @xmath15 is the adsorbate - substrate excess energy .",
    "the model is presented in fig1 .",
    "we choose j as the energy unit , so that @xmath16 in the following .",
    "since @xmath13 appears in all rates in eqs.([e : nu_n],[e : r_n],[e : r_e ] ) , we choose @xmath17 as the time unit , where @xmath18 hence , in the following , we set @xmath19 .     and @xmath4 , and sublimation rate @xmath6 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=4 ] +    the parameter @xmath15 controls the wetting properties of the film on the substrate . for example , when @xmath20 , the film completely wets the substrate . in this work , we consider @xmath21 ( partial wetting ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the surface excess energy @xmath15 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the energy per site of the adsorbate - vacuum surface , adsorbate - substrate interface and substrate - vacuum surface , respectively .",
    "this parameter is then identical ( with opposite sign ) to the spreading coefficient s defined in references ref.@xcite for the study of liquid dewetting .",
    "the algorithm used in the simulations is the following .",
    "we list all atoms into classes .",
    "each class is characterized by the number of in - plane neighbors @xmath11 of the atom and by the existence or not of a nearest neighbor belonging to the substrate . at a given time t",
    ", we calculate the probabilities per unit time @xmath26 of all possible events ( an event is the motion of an atom originally at position @xmath27 ) given either by eq.([e : nu_n ] ) , eq.([e : r_n ] ) or eq.([e : r_e ] ) , and the sum w of all those rates ( for all mobile atoms ) .",
    "we increment the time by a @xmath28 , which is equal to the inverse of the sum of the rates of all possible events , corresponds to the average value of the waiting time between two successive events @xcite . ]",
    "we choose the event with probability @xmath30 . in the case of diffusion ,",
    "the atom moves with equal probability in any of the four possible directions .",
    "the initial configuration is a film of constant height covering the substrate , leaving only a small stripe uncovered along the ( 10 ) direction .",
    "the film edges are straight in the beginning .",
    "atoms diffuse at the surface of the film and on the substrate .",
    "however , they can evaporate only when they are on the substrate .",
    "if we let the system evolve for a long enough time , all atoms should evaporate , and there will be no atoms left on the substrate in the final state .",
    "however , we are only interested in the early stages of the dynamics , where the dewetting dynamics occurs . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the dewetting dynamics proceeds with the formation of receding dewetting rims at the edges of the film .",
    "we varied the sublimation energy barrier @xmath14 to investigate the influence of sublimation in the dewetting regimes .",
    "if @xmath31 is sufficiently high , we recover the case considered before @xcite with no sublimation ( the adsorbate dewets driven only by diffusion and attachment / detachment of adatoms ) .    , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "in order to analyze the dewetting dynamics observed in kmc simulations , we use a 1d model in which the dewetting front is assumed to be straight , and invariant along the direction @xmath38 .",
    "the position of the edge of the film is denoted as @xmath39 . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the height exhibits a jump of height @xmath40 between the substrate and the rim top facet . on the other side of the dewetting rim",

    ", we have : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the adatom concentration and diffusion constant on the rim top facet , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the adatom concentration and diffusion constant on the substrate . in addition , @xmath50 is the atomic volume .    on the substrate , the adatom concentration @xmath48 obeys a quasistatic diffusion equation with evaporation @xmath51 where @xmath49 and @xmath52 are the diffusion constant and sublimation time of adatoms on the substrate .",
    "the general solution of eq.([e : diff_substrate ] ) reads : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sublimation length .",
    "we consider a geometry similar to that of kmc simulations : two dewetting fronts , separated by the distance @xmath55 , recede in opposite directions .",
    "the boundary condition at the fronts is assumed to be instantaneous attachment - detachment kinetics , leading to : @xmath56 using this condition in eq.([e : cs_of ab ] ) , we find @xmath57 and , as a consequence the contribution of evaporation to the dewetting front velocity in eq.([e : flat_1 ] ) is : @xmath58    on the top of the rim , the adatom concentration @xmath46 obeys a quasistatic diffusion equation @xmath59 assuming translational invariance in the other direction @xmath38 , and instantaneous attachment - detachment kinetics leading to fixed concentrations @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath39 and @xmath62 , we obtain for @xmath63 : @xmath64 so that @xmath65",
    ". the dynamical equations may then be re - written as : @xmath66 now @xmath40 and @xmath44 are time dependent . moreover , @xmath67 also depends on time via @xmath40 .",
    "since we assume no evaporation on the film , we use the same theory as in ref.@xcite for the rim height evolution .",
    "following ref.@xcite we assume that the rim height evolution is controlled by 2d nucleation on the facet with a nucleation rate : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the atomic step free energy on the film .",
    "the monolayer islands formed by the 2d nucleation process then spread on the rim top facet with the velocity@xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a number .",
    "we will also assume that the temperature is high enough so that steps are isotropic , and @xmath72 .",
    "assuming a total rim length @xmath73 , the rim height evolution reads@xcite : @xmath74 , \\label{e : h1_evol_mnsn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which accounts for both regimes of single and multiple nucleation .",
    "the model equations ( [ e : dynamical_flat1],[e : dynamical_flat2],[e : h1_evol_mnsn ] ) are similar to that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the only difference is the term @xmath75 which appears in eq.([e : dynamical_flat1 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we shall evaluate the model parameters as a function of the kmc parameters .    on the film ,",
    "the adatom concentration is given by detailed balance@xcite : @xmath76 and the diffusion constant reads : @xmath77 the energy cost for an adatom to be in contact with the substrate is @xmath15 , and therefore : @xmath78 finally , the sublimation time on the substrate reads : @xmath79 where @xmath14 is the substrate desorption energy .",
    "we have measured @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath80 as a function of time for various parameters in kmc simulations .",
    "as opposed to the case without sublimation , we have not found any ( even partial ) analytical solution of the model .",
    "we therefore resort to a full numerical solution of eqs.([e : dynamical_flat1],[e : dynamical_flat2],[e : h1_evol_mnsn ] )     for @xmath81 ( red circles ) , @xmath82 ( green squares ) , @xmath83 ( blue squares),and @xmath84 ( magenta triangles ) . other parameters : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 .",

    "interestingly , the evolution of the rim width is non - monotonous , and exhibits a maximum in time both in the model and in kmc simulations .",

    "indeed , we simply measure the area of the film with height @xmath88 , and divide by the total rim length @xmath89 .",

    "we have studied the dewetting dynamics of thin solid films in the presence of substrate sublimation . the overall agreement between kmc and",
    "the analytical model indicates that we have caught the main physical ingredients of the dynamics .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the transition between the early time diffusion - limited regime , and the late time sublimation - limited regime .",
    "since the nucleation rate @xmath94 decreases exponentially with @xmath40 , the evolution of @xmath40 essentially occurs in a short transient regime at short times .",
    "we shall therefore base our analysis on the fact that @xmath40 evolves very slowly .    in the competition between diffusion and sublimation , the process which controls the dynamics is the one which leads to the largest contribution to the front velocity . for fixed @xmath40",
    ", diffusion leads to @xmath95 , and sublimation leads to @xmath96 .",
    "hence , we expect that diffusion always wins at short times , while sublimation controls the late time regime .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=5 ] +    in the late - time dynamics , which is dominated by sublimation , the front moves approximately at constant velocity .",
    "hence , we expect the dewetting rim to be roughly stationary , with a slow variation of @xmath80 .",
    "an evolution equation for @xmath80 is obtained by taking the difference between eq.([e : dynamical_flat1 ] ) and eq.([e : dynamical_flat2 ] ) , and assuming that @xmath101 . plugging @xmath102 into this equation",
    "leads to @xmath103 recalling that @xmath40 is not fixed , but in fact increases slowly , the expression of @xmath100 should be interpreted as a slow decrease of @xmath80 caused by the increase of @xmath40 . as shown on fig.[fig4 ] , @xmath99 and @xmath100 provide reasonably good approximations of @xmath80 at short and long times .    combining the two expressions , we obtain the crossover time from the relation @xmath104 as : @xmath105 where we have assumed that @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , since the growth of @xmath40 slows down exponentially with time , we assume that @xmath107 is of order of 1 .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath108 as a consequence , we see that the crossover time will decrease as sublimation ( and hence @xmath75 ) increases .",
    "this formula provides the correct order of magnitude as compared to the maximum observed in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the situation discussed in the present work can be compared with the results of srolovitz and safran@xcite , which also find a front evolution with constant velocity . in their model",
    ", there is simultaneously sublimation and adsorption between the film and the vapor , so that the net growth of a flat film vanishes .",
    "the motion of the film height @xmath43 is then driven by local chemical potential variations . since the local chemical potential is proportional to the surface curvature , we obtain in the small slope approximation : @xmath109 .",
    "typically , we expect @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the evaporation - condensation kinetic coefficient , @xmath112 is the equilibrium vapor density , and @xmath113 is the surface stiffness ( which is assumed to be isotropic ) .",
    "the edge of the film , which exhibits a larger curvature , has a larger chemical potential , so that the sublimation at the edge is reinforced and is not compensated by adsorption from the vapor .",
    "therefore , the front recedes by sublimation at the film edge .",
    "srolovitz and safran find a front velocity @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is initial film height , and @xmath116 is the contact angle , which is related to @xmath15 via@xcite : @xmath117 as a summary , the modeling of srolovitz and safran correspond to the case of a film in equilibrium with its vapor , a situation which is very different from the one considered in the present study .",
    "however , the dewetting process qualitatively obeys the same behavior , with fronts moving at constant velocity .",
    "although @xmath118 decreases exponentially with @xmath40 , it does not vanish , so that @xmath40 is not constant . ] .",
    "dewetting of soi systems , consisting of si crystalline films on amorphous sio@xmath0 substrates , has been investigated recently@xcite .",
    "the presence of reaction si+sio@xmath1192sio has been suggested in several experiments , and there is still an issue about the determination of the place where the reaction occurs .",
    "if si atoms diffuse through the triple line on sio@xmath0 , and then react with sio@xmath0 , then the situation would be quite similar to our model system .",
    "( note that the reaction should lead to an etching of the substrate , which is not taken into account in our model ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with that proposed for the deoxydization of sio@xmath0 films on si substrates @xcite .",
    "however , the reaction mechanism is controversial , and a more complex scenario involving the diffusion of oxygen at the interface was also proposed@xcite . therefore , we expect substrate reaction to lead to a change in the time evolution of the position of straight fronts , from a power law behavior with an effective exponent close to @xmath120 , to an approximately linear behavior .",
    "this crossover could appear with increasing temperature if reaction is activated at high temperatures .",
    "substrate evaporation could also be important for the dewetting dynamics of metallic films@xcite , where the temperature is often increased up to temperatures where sublimation can not be neglected .",
    "in conclusion , in the presence of adatom sublimation on the substrate , the motion of a dewetting front exhibits a crossover from a constant thickening and widening of the rim , accompanied with a slowing down ( with the front position obeying an approximate power - law @xmath121 ) , to a regime where the velocity is approximately constant . in this latter regime ,",
    "the rim height increases slowly , and the rim width decreases slowly .",
    "surprisingly , the rim width exhibits a maximum at the crossover between the two regimes .",
    "we have obtained quantitative agreement between kmc simulations and a model with diffusion limited mass transport on the rim , nucleation limited increase of the rim height , and evaporation on the substrate .",
