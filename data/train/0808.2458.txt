    "perturbation theory has played a major role in the establishment of the standard model of electro - weak and strong interactions .",
    "however , it is well known @xcite that perturbative series have a zero radius of convergence and that at some critical order , adding more terms does not improve the accuracy of the result .",
    "there exists a connection between large field configurations and the large order of perturbative series @xcite that can be illustrated with the simple integral @xmath0 the truncation of the exponential at order @xmath1 is justified if the argument is much smaller than @xmath1 . however , the peak of the integrand is located at @xmath2 . for this value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the argument of the exponential is @xmath4 , which for @xmath1 large enough will be larger than @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the peak of the integrand of the r.h.s .",
    "moves too fast when the order increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if we introduce a field cutoff , the peak moves outside of the integration range and @xmath5 this example suggests that one should use perturbation theory to treat small quantum fluctuations and semi - classical methods to treat the large field configurations .    for qcd , an important challenge is to describe the large distance behavior of the theory in terms of degrees of freedom which are weakly coupled at short distance .",
    "this question can be addressed in the framework of the lattice formulation .",
    "we consider the simplest case of wilson s action which is the sum over the plaquettes in the fundamental @xmath6 representation : @xmath7 with the usual notation @xmath8 , the partition function reads @xmath9 for @xmath10 , this theory has no phase transition when one goes from small coupling ( large @xmath11 ) to large coupling ( small @xmath11 ) . recently ,",
    "convincing argument have been given @xcite in favor of the smoothness of the rg flows between the two corresponding fixed points .",
    "consequently , there does not seem to exist any fundamental obstruction to match the two regimes .",
    "one general question that we would like to address is if it is possible to construct a modified weak coupling expansion that could bridge the gap to the strong coupling regime .",
    "lattice gauge theories with a _ compact _ group have a build - in large field cutoff : the group elements associated with the links are integrated with @xmath12 , the compact haar measure . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the action density has an upper bound which is saturated when the group element is a nontrivial element of the center .",
    "it is remarkable that this formulation has a uv regularization _ and _ a large field regularization that preserves gauge invariance . does the presence of large field cutoff means that perturbative series are convergent ?",
    "not necessarilly , because in constructing perturbative series , one decompactifies @xcite the gauge field integration which at low order amounts to neglect exponentially small tails of integration , but modifies the large order drastically .    in continuous field theories ,",
    "it is expected @xcite that the large order of perturbative series can be calculated from classical solutions at small negative @xmath15 for scalar theories or small negative @xmath16 for gauge theories . for lattice gauge theory with compact groups ,",
    "the theory is mathematically well defined at negative @xmath16 , i. e. , negative @xmath11 , but some wilson loops oscillate when their size change and the average plaquette has a discontinuity when @xmath16 changes sign@xcite . for small negative @xmath16 , i. e. , large negative @xmath11 ,",
    "the behavior of expectation values is dominated by the large field configurations .",
    "this statement can be made more precise by introducing the spectral decomposition @xmath17 with @xmath18 the so - called density of states .",
    "it is clear that for large negative @xmath11 , what matters is the behavior of @xmath18 near @xmath19 .",
    "we can make the discussion more concrete by considering the case of the single plaquette model @xcite with @xmath13 gauge group . in this case ,",
    "@xmath20 and we have @xmath21 the weak coupling expansion of @xmath22 is determined by the behavior of near @xmath23 .",
    "when we expand @xmath24 about @xmath25 , the large order of this series is determined by the cut at @xmath23 .",
    "after integration ( from 0 to @xmath26 ) over @xmath27 , the series with a finite radius of convergence becomes asymptotic ( inverse borel transform ) .",
    "alternatively , we can maintain the finite range of integration and construct a converging weak coupling expansion but with coupling dependent coefficients as done by hadamard a century ago in his study of bessel functions .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the features of the one plaquette model persist in the infinite volume limit of lattice gauge theory .    in these proceedings",
    ", we discuss the large order behavior of the weak coupling expansion of the plaquette ( sec .",
    "2 ) and the possibility of defining its non - perturbative part ( the gluon condensate ?",
    "3 ) . more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec . 4 , we present numerical results concerning the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling plane @xcite ( fisher s zeros ) . this problem could be solved using the density of states .",
    "preliminary numerical results concerning the density of states are provided in sec .",
    "5 where we also show that weak and strong coupling expansions for the density of states agree surprisingly well for values of the actions relevant for the crossover regime . after the conference",
    ", we wrote a more detailed preprint @xcite concerning this question .",
    "in this section , we denote @xmath28 the number of plaquettes and the average plaquette : @xmath29 the weak coupling expansion of this quantity @xmath30 has been calculated up to order ten @xcite and 16 @xcite .",
    "series analysis @xcite suggest a singularity @xmath31 and consequently a finite radius of convergence .",
    "this is not expected since the plaquette changes discontinuously @xcite at @xmath32 .",
    "this behavior is also not seen in the 2d derivative of @xmath33 and would require massless glueballs .",
    "a simple alternative is that the critical point in the fundamental - adjoint plane @xcite has mean field exponents and in particular @xmath34 . on the @xmath35 line",
    ", we assume an approximate logarithmic behavior ( mean field ) @xmath36 @xmath37 can not be too small ( absence of singularities ) or too large ( this would create visible oscllations in the perturbative coefficients ) . from these constraints , we get the approximate bounds @xcite @xmath38 .    integrating , we get the approximate form @xmath39 with @xmath40 we fixed @xmath41 and obtained @xmath42 and @xmath43=5.787 using of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the low order coefficients depend very little on @xmath37 ( when @xmath46 ) , larger series are needed to get a better estimate of @xmath37 for @xmath14 .",
    "it interesting to notice that we get very good predictions of the values of @xmath47 !",
    "we believe that these regularities should have a feynman diagram interpretation .",
    "another possible model @xcite is based on ir renormalons @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 corresponds to the uv cutoff while @xmath51 corresponds to the landau pole .",
    "for @xmath52 we get a perturbative series with a factorial growth , in contrast with the previous model which had a power growth .",
    "unfortunately a clear distinction between the two types of large order behavior requires numerical calculations at order larger than 20 .",
    "using the two large order extrapolations described in the previous section , one can see good evidence @xcite for @xmath53 with @xmath54 defined with the so - called force scale , @xcite and @xmath55 appropriately truncated for the second model .",
    "@xmath56 is sensitive to resummation . @xmath57 with the bare series @xcite and 0.4 with the tadpole improved series @xcite .",
    "it is tempting but potentially dangerous to try to relate @xmath56 to the numerical value of the gluon condensate@xcite .",
    "if we identify @xcite for @xmath10 @xmath58 we obtain for @xmath59 and @xmath60 that @xmath61 which is about 3 times the original estimate@xcite .",
    "it is not clear to us that there is a precise correspondence between the continuum and the lattice definitions .",
    "also , different values for the continuum value have been proposed .",
    "a negative value @xcite , subsequently criticized @xcite can even be found .",
    "for these reasons , some authors @xcite prefer to use a value 0 with error bars when estimating @xmath62 at some large scale .",
    "if we use the correspondence between the lattice and the continuum discussed above at face value with @xmath63 , these error bars should be multiplied by a factor 3 to 6 .",
    "the existence of complex singularities near the real axis can be tested by studying the complex zeros of the partition function @xcite .",
    "the basic technique is the reweighting @xcite of action distributions at given @xmath64 @xmath65 as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath66 is the laplace transform of the density of states @xmath18 . for @xmath13 with even numbers of sites in each direction",
