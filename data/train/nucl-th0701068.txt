    "the shell model formalism first introduced spectroscopic factors ( sf ) to describe the shell occupancy @xcite . in particular , @xmath9 , the single particle sf , is defined as the norm of the overlap function of a nucleus ( a+1 ) in a particular state @xmath10 with a nucleus a in a state @xmath11 , where the valence nucleon is in an orbital with orbital and total angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "these sfs have been extensively compared with those extracted from reactions . at present ab - initio calculations",
    "are improving the accuracy of the calculated sfs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one would eventually like to have a very accurate probe that could test the predictions of these models and could disentangle the relevant elements of the nn force that are still missing , especially when moving toward the driplines .    from the experimentalist point of view , a spectroscopic factor is a ratio of measured to predicted differential cross sections .",
    "phenomenological spectroscopic factors are extensively used in a variety of topics , from nuclear reactions to astrophysics or applied physics , yet the procedure for their extraction from the data has remained essentially the same for decades .",
    "most of the work in the sixties and seventies used direct transfer reactions , such as @xmath13 , as the central tool @xcite .",
    "however transfer analyses have a reputation of large uncertainties .",
    "other methods to extract spectroscopic information include the ( e , ep ) reactions or the nuclear knockout in inverse kinematics . for stable nuclei , there have been many electron knockout experiments .",
    "they have provided sfs with rather small error bars @xcite . the analysis of these measurements along a wide mass range , for single particle states with expected sfs close to unity , show an overall reduction of the sf ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the source of this reduction is not yet well understood @xcite although one expects nn short or long range correlations which are not included in the present day non - ab - initio shell model to contribute .",
    "nuclear knockout in inverse kinematics using radioactive beams is a new probe introduced at the nscl @xcite . a systematic study of spectroscopy on a variety of nuclei , ranging from the stability valley to the proton dripline ,",
    "have been performed using this technique .",
    "it is found that the measured spectroscopic factors suffer from a reduction relative to the shell model predictions and the reduction factor changes with binding energy @xcite .",
    "again , it is not clear where this quenching @xcite comes from .",
    "of course , as ( e , ep ) , this technique is only suitable for studying the single particle structure of the ground states of nuclei .",
    "the ( e , ep ) cross section is sensitive to the structure all the way to the inside of the nucleus , whereas the transfer is typically peripheral and surface peaked .",
    "the knockout reactions with radioactive beams have been performed in a kinematical regime where the eikonal approximation can be used , to simplify the reaction theory and to reduce the reaction model uncertainties @xcite .",
    "nuclear knockout results @xcite are in agreement with the ( e , ep ) sfs for the tested stable closed shell nuclei @xcite",
    ". transfer and ( e , ep ) have also been compared @xcite for @xmath15ca .",
    "earlier transfer studies provided a spectroscopic factor for the last proton close to unity , but a reanalysis by @xcite including finite - range and non - local effects in the transfer reaction model , show that the transfer result can be brought down to 0.6 , the ( e , ep ) value .",
    "the spectroscopic factor is the norm of the overlap function , which peaks well inside the nuclear radius @xmath16 .",
    "as the ( e , ep ) reaction can probe the nuclear interior , it is suitable for extracting sfs as long as the reaction mechanism is well understood .",
    "however there are some problems with the high momentum transfer component , associated with probing the inside of the nucleus , because then the born approximation is not valid @xcite .",
    "for exotic nuclei near or on the driplines , transfer reactions are a unique tool and , hence , can have a large impact in the programs of the new generation rare isotope laboratories .",
    "the standard framework for analysing transfer data with the intent of extracting sfs is the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "overall , it has been very successful in describing angular distributions at forward angles and less so for the larger angles where higher order become more important .",
    "the sf is the normalization needed for the calculated dwba differential cross section to match the experimental one at forward angles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the extracted sf resulting from the normalization of the dwba cross section is assumed to be @xmath17% , even if the statistical errors are low .",
    "the reasons for this inaccuracy are typically attributed to ambiguities in the optical potentials , the inadequacy of the dwba reaction theory , or the dependence on the single - particle potential parameters . recently",
    ", systematic studies on @xmath18c(d , p)@xmath19c have shown that it is possible to bring sfs into conformity using a global optical potential prescription @xcite , whereas arbitrary choices of the optical potential will hold disparate results .",
    "as to the reaction mechanism , there are many studies on the validity of dwba ( e.g. @xcite ) and typically the reaction mechanism needs to be checked case by case . in addition , hartree - fock densities have been suggested as a mean to constrain the single particle parameters @xcite .",
    "therein , the single particle radii for the ca isotopes were adjusted to reproduce the known rms matter radii , and zero range dwba calculations were performed to extract the sfs .    in @xcite ,",
    "a combined method of extracting sfs from transfer reactions was introduced .",
    "this method can also be applied to breakup and ( e , ep ) reactions .",
    "the combined method , which is based on the introduction of the asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) into the transfer analysis , allows one to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the choice of the bound state potential parameters and to test the dwba or other underlying reaction theory . in the combined method",
    "the anc should be determined from an independent measurement of a peripheral reaction while the sf is determined from transfer reactions which are sensitive to the nuclear interior . in @xcite",
    "we emphasize that fixing the anc is absolutely necessary , since even when the beam energy is well above the coulomb barrier , most of the reaction happens in the asymptotic region",
    ". it has been found @xcite that , in @xmath20 reactions , the standard single particle parameters for the radius @xmath21 fm and diffuseness @xmath22 , which typically provide unit sf for closed shell nuclei , do not reproduce the value of the anc extracted from the lower energy measurement . in this work we expand on the ideas of the combined method , and explore other uncertainties ( such as optical potentials and higher order effects ) to attempt a unification of the sf and the anc , searching for a reaction description which is practical and gives reliable spectroscopic information .    in section",
    "ii we present a short description of the theoretical framework . in section",
    "iii we detail the results for our three test cases : iiia for dwba results using a global deuteron optical potential , iiib for dwba results where the deuteron potential is obtain from a direct fit to the elastic , iiic for results including deuteron breakup within the adiabatic model , iiid for checks of other higher order effects and also in iiie a further analysis of peripherality .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the central element of the analysis of the transfer reaction @xmath23 @xcite is the overlap function @xmath24 between bound - states of nuclei @xmath25 and @xmath26 which depends on @xmath27 , the radius - vector connecting the center of mass of @xmath26 with @xmath28 .",
    "the square norm of the overlap function gives a model - independent definition of the sf .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that most of the contribution to the sf comes from the interior .",
    "the radial overlap function ( for @xmath29 ) behaves as a spherical bessel function for large distances : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the binding energy for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the reduced mass of @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath35 represents a radius beyond which the nuclear potential is negligible and @xmath36 is referred to as the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) .",
    "the standard practice is to take the radial dependence of the overlap function from the single particle orbital .",
    "this radial wavefunction is usually generated by a woods saxon potential with a given geometry .",
    "the depths are adjusted such that the single particle orbital has the correct separation energy and quantum numbers ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "generally , the single particle orbital has the same asymptotic behaviour as the many - body overlap function : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the single - particle anc ( spanc ) . from the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ ovasymptotic ] ) and ( [ spasymptotic ] ) , and under the assumption that the many - body overlap is indeed proportional to the single particle function all the way down to @xmath40 , the anc and the sf are related by @xmath41 .",
    "so far , it is hard to check the exactness of this proportionality given the accuracy of the asymptotics of the wavefunction obtained from ab - initio calculations .",
    "for @xmath23 , the one - step post - form finite range dwba amplitude is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the transition operator , @xmath44 is the interaction potential between @xmath10 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the optical potential in the final - state .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the distorted waves in the initial and final states and @xmath49 is the deuteron bound - state wave function .    in @xcite ,",
    "the reaction amplitude is split into interior and exterior parts .",
    "the normalisation of the former is determined by the sf while the anc governs the normalisation of the latter .",
    "we introduce the ratio @xmath50 to compare with the experimental counterpart @xmath51 . introducing the information about the anc fixes the exterior contribution .",
    "if the reaction is completely peripheral , its cross section will scale directly as @xmath52 , but will hold no information on the sf .",
    "if there is an interior contribution , the theoretical cross section has a non - trivial dependence on the spanc @xmath53 which can be constrained by @xmath54 .",
    "hence , peripheral reactions are ideal to extract ancs but useless for extracting sfs .",
    "to determine sfs one should explore non - peripheral reactions .",
    "the combined method presented in @xcite tries to isolate the ambiguity coming from the single particle parameters but the resulting sfs are often smaller than those produced by shell model . as in this method , the interior part plays an important role to determine the sf , the results will be more sensitive to the optical potentials and coupling effects . with global optical potentials ,",
    "the single particle parameters obtained from @xmath54 are often far from the conventional values , and the corresponding angular distributions provide a worse description of the data , when compared to the standard procedure .",
    "the main questions we want to address here is whether dwba ( or higher order reaction theory ) allows us to extract correct sfs when fixing the peripheral part of the transfer amplitude through the experimentally determined ancs .",
    "the most important consequence of the work in @xcite is the fact that within the standard dwba approach , the extracted spectroscopic factors are inconsistent with the ancs obtained through independent measurements .",
    "this will be illustrated through the examples in this section .    by _ standard dwba",
    "_ we mean the framework in which the 1-step transfer matrix element is evaluated with incoming and outgoing distorted waves calculated by fitting the deuteron and proton elastic scattering with local optical potentials .",
    "the transfer operator contains finite range effects as well as the full complex remnant term .",
    "ancs can be extracted from sub - coulomb reactions , which are coulomb dominated and contain virtually no contribution from the nuclear interior . for the @xmath4o(g.s . )",
    "case , we have two sets of heavy ion collision data that provide @xmath55 @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 @xmath56 @xcite respectively . for the other two cases ,",
    "no heavy ion transfer data exist , therefore alternative data was used . for @xmath1c(g.s . )",
    "knockout data from @xcite and @xcite was jointly used in @xcite to extract an anc of @xmath58 @xmath56 . note that other values can be obtained through different types of reactions such as capture @xcite .",
    "we want to be consistent with the anc extractions in all three test cases , thus we use the anc obtained through nuclear processes . for @xmath7ca(g.s . ) , ( d , p ) data at sub - coulomb energies was used @xcite from which we obtain @xmath59 @xmath56 .",
    "the transfer calculations are performed for @xmath0c(d , p)@xmath1c(g.s . ) at @xmath2 mev @xcite , @xmath3o(d , p)@xmath4o(g.s . ) at @xmath5 mev @xcite , and @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . ) at @xmath8 mev @xcite .",
    "these reactions were chosen because both elastic and transfer data exist at the same energy .",
    "all data can be found on the database website at michigan state university @xcite .",
    "calculations were performed with the code fresco @xcite .",
    "we perform finite - range post - form dwba calculations , including the full complex transition operator @xmath60 .",
    "the reid - soft - core interaction @xcite is used for the deuteron ground state wavefunction , and includes both s- and d - waves .",
    "we use the central part of the reid - soft - core interaction for @xmath61 in the transfer operator .",
    "the diffuseness of the single particle orbital of the final state is kept fixed ( a=0.65 fm ) , but the radius is varied to generate a range of spancs . throughout this work",
    "we will always use the ch89 global parameterization @xcite for the outgoing distorted waves .",
    "we have checked that by using a different proton global potential , spectroscopic factors change less than 10 % .",
    "we will look into several approaches to determine the initial wavefunction . in this subsection",
    "we take the perey & perey deuteron potential ( pp ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting angular distributions are displayed in figs .",
    "[ c15global ] , [ o17global ] and [ ca41global ] , for a subset of @xmath62 , and compared to data",
    ". we will refer to these calculation as dwbag . even though it provides a fair description of the first peak of the distribution",
    ", it is inadequate for the large angles , where higher order effects become important .",
    "this is a well known characteristic of dwba .",
    ".sfs and ancs obtained from dwba analyses : perey and perey potential for the deuteron .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - optpot2 ]    changes in the deep interior do not reflect sensitivity of the transfer process to this region .",
    "transfer reactions are known to be surface peaked .",
    "this usually means that impact parameters smaller than the sum of the projectile and target radii do not contribute to the reaction . in @xmath23 ,",
    "this is related to the cutoff on @xmath63 .",
    "the results of this standard peripherality check is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio2 ] for the three reactions under study .",
    "the percentage ratio of the cross section integrated up to @xmath64 to the total transfer cross section r(% ) is plotted . in the deep interior",
    "this ratio is zero and it goes to @xmath65 % for large distances .",
    "the region where it increases rapidly corresponds to the surface region , where the transfer takes place .",
    "however , to probe the sensitivity to the sf , one needs to analyse the dependence with @xmath66 . under a zero range approximation of the deuteron",
    ", these two tests would be identical .",
    "when taking into account the finite range of @xmath61 and the remnant part of the full transition operator , peripherality in @xmath63 is not equivalent to peripherality in @xmath66 .",
    "to illustrate this fact , peripherality tests were performed by evaluating the interior contribution to the total transfer cross section relative to @xmath66 .",
    "these peripherality tests are based on dwbaf ( _ fit 1 ) _ and dwba with the deuteron potential fit simulaneously to elastic and transfer ( fit 2 ) .",
    "we take the radial integrals in the coordinates of @xmath67 , and truncate the integration in @xmath68 to a maximum value r : @xmath69 the percentage ratio of this value to the full integration is presented in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "as before , if @xmath40 fm , the ratio should be zero , and it should tail off at 100 % when r becomes very large .",
    "results show that , in all cases there is no contribution up to 2 fm .",
    "one can also see that , even though 14 mev is above the coulomb barrier , the @xmath70 happens at rather large distances , due to its loosely bound nature .",
    "contributions up to @xmath71 % from the surface / interior are present in both @xmath72 at @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 at @xmath75 mev .",
    "in this work we have studied transfer reactions to states considered good single particles , with three different q - values , namely @xmath0c(d , p)@xmath1c(g.s . ) at @xmath2 mev , @xmath3o(d , p)@xmath4o(g.s . ) at @xmath5 mev @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . ) at @xmath8 mev .",
    "all these reactions are above the coulomb barrier and therefore contain some information from the interior .",
    "the standard dwba method , using global optical potentials and the typical single particle parameters , produces sfs in agreement with shell model predictions , however the corresponding ancs are not consistent with those extracted from independent measurements .",
    "if one imposes , within the dwba formulation , ancs that are consistent with the experimental values , the extracted sfs are significantly reduced compared to the shell model predictions .",
    "some improvements on the sf / anc mismatch can be obtained by using a deuteron optical potential fitted directly to the corresponding elastic data , at the relevant energy . in particular , for @xmath3o(d , p ) we obtain sf / anc consistency .",
    "however the problem for the other two cases is not resolved .",
    "the deuteron adiabatic potential , which takes into account breakup , can change the sf up to @xmath76 % .",
    "this improves the situation for @xmath0c(d , p ) but fails to bring the @xmath7ca anc anywhere close to the value extracted from an independent sub - coulomb measurement .",
    "deuteron breakup is not the only important ingredient to the solution of this problem : in all cases we find an influence of surface higher order effects .",
    "for @xmath0c(d , p)@xmath1c(g.s . ) at @xmath2 mev , ccba effects are negligible but crc effects produce a reduction of the anc consistent with unity sf : @xmath77 @xmath56 , a significant reduction compared to the dwba case , which together with the reduction from deuteron breakup produces an anc much closer to the experimental value @xmath78 @xmath56 . for @xmath3o(d , p)@xmath4o(g.s . ) at @xmath5 mev , crc effects are small but ccba couplings to the @xmath79 state in @xmath3o were found to be important .",
    "this brings down the @xmath80 from 0.76 to 0.56 , neither too far from the experimental number @xmath81 @xmath56 . finally , the @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . )",
    "case remains problematic : both crc and ccba are relevant but act in the wrong direction .",
    "overall , an anc , consistent with unity sf , falls short by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "contrary to ( e , ep ) measurements , transfer reactions are surface peaked and it is disconcerting that the traditional methods to handle higher order effects at the surface are not able to solve the sf / anc discrepancy for one of our test cases . the very fact that , even when the energies are well above the coulomb barrier , there is such a large contribution from the peripheral region , makes it extremely important to pin down the anc input unambiguously .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of a problem in the @xmath7ca anc we extracted from other data .",
    "experiments to measure ancs for this case is crucial to settle this matter . in the future",
    "we suggest that experiments be designed for the extraction of ancs in parallel with the corresponding experiments aimed at extracting sfs .",
