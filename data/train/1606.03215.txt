    "<S> semiconductor quantum dots can emit antibunched , single photons on demand with narrow linewidths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed linewidths are broader than lifetime measurements predict , due to spin and charge noise in the environment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this noise randomly shifts the transition energy and destroys coherence @xcite and indistinguishability @xcite of the emitted photons . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the fluctuations can be reduced by a stabilization using a suitable feedback loop @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a fast feedback loop that manifests itself in a strong hysteresis and bistability of the exciton resonance fluorescence signal . </S>",
    "<S> field ionization of photogenerated quantum dot excitons leads to the formation of a charged interface layer that drags the emission line along over a frequency range of more than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this internal charge - driven feedback loop could be used to reduce the spectral diffusion and stabilize the emission frequency within milliseconds , presently only limited by the sample structure , but already faster than nuclear spin feedback .    </S>",
    "<S> a vision in quantum information technology is a quantum network @xcite where the quantum bits ( qubits ) are stored in nodes and connected via quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are one possible candidate for such a quantum node @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can host , for instance , a spin qubit @xcite , and the quantum information can be transferred between different nodes via single photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these photons suffer from frequency noise , induced by residual charges and spins in their environment @xcite , which reduces their coherence and indistinguishability @xcite .    a possibility to reduce </S>",
    "<S> this spectral jitter is a feedback loop that counteracts the external fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> one option is an _ </S>",
    "<S> external _ </S>",
    "<S> feedback that measures the emission frequency and then corrects it by setting a gate voltage , using the stark effect@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the resonance fluorescence ( rf ) of a self - assembled qd produces single photons while simultaneously the emission energy is determined from the differential transmission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a feedback loop effectively stabilizes the qd photon emission up to a frequency of about @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the feedback can be based on _ internal _ mechanisms , using the coupling of the electron - hole pairs to the environment . in magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction of the excitons with the nuclear spins in the dot leads to a dragging - like hysteresis of the resonance fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis is caused by dynamic nuclear spin polarization @xcite and can also be used to stabilize the emission line @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an internal feedback loop needs no further optical or electrical detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bandwidth of this internal nuclear spin feedback seems to be restricted to about @xmath2 .        </S>",
    "<S> we use here a micro - patterned device that consists of a schottky diode with a layer of self - assembled inas / gaas qds ( see the schematic band structure in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1]a and methods below ) to demonstrate an inherently fast internal and charge - driven feedback loop in the resonance fluorescence of a single dot . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom trace in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1]b shows the rf signal when the exciton transition is shifted upwards or downwards across the laser frequency ( blue and red lines , respectively ) by sweeping the voltage that is applied to the device . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the commonly found lorentzian line shape of excitons in single inas quantum dots @xcite , the resonances observed here show several distinctly different characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> they are much broader and exhibit a strongly asymmetric shape with a gradual increase on the low energy side and an abrupt decrease on the high energy side . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the traces show a pronounced hysteresis over a range of @xmath3 not only in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) but also for both zeeman - split exciton transitions at @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the width and the asymmetry of the resonance as well as the hysteresis indicate that the resonance is `` dragged along '' as the excitation frequency is shifted . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by a three - step process that leads to the buildup of transient charge at the gaas/(alga)as interface , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1]a @xcite : ( 1 ) upon resonant excitation , bound electron hole pairs are generated in the dot . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) these excitons can be field ionized by tunnelling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron escapes to the back contact , while the hole becomes trapped in the triangular well at the gaas-(alga)as interface . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the stored , positive charge in that well will slowly drain , e.g. by tunnelling through the ( alga)as barrier . </S>",
    "<S> process ( 3 ) depends on the total number of holes in the well , so that for a given pumping efficiency ( process ( 2 ) ) , a specific amount of transient positive charge will be stored at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> this charge affects the electric field across the dot , which will slightly detune the resonance with respect to the laser frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting feedback loop ( pumping efficiency @xmath6 amount of trapped charge @xmath6 resonance position @xmath6 pumping efficiency ) can explain the resonance width and shape as well as the bistability : when the pumping frequency is on the low energy side of the exciton resonance line ( red point at zero detuning in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1]c ) , the feedback will be negative , so that a stable configuration is achieved : a small increase in the number @xmath7 of stored holes will blue - shift the resonance to more positive detuning , as indicated by the arrow . </S>",
    "<S> this will reduce the overlap of the exciton line with the laser , reduce the pumping efficiency , and decrease @xmath7 again . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , there will be a positive feedback on the high energy side of the resonance , which explains the abrupt drop of the fluorescence on this side . when the laser coincides with the maximum of the exciton line ( red point at 30 ghz detuning in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1]c ) , a small decrease in @xmath7 will red - shift the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this will further reduce the pumping efficiency until the resonance has almost completely shifted out of resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> just below the maximum , there will be two possible stable configurations , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2]a . for a more quantitative description of the observed line shape and hysteresis </S>",
    "<S> , we model the system by a rate equation approach . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath7 of trapped holes is given by the interplay between the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , described by the rates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is determined by an ionization probability @xmath10 and the overlap between the laser line and the lorentzian line shape @xmath11 of the exciton absorption line , with a position that depends on @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the leakage rate is assumed to be proportional to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting differential equation @xmath12 is solved numerically , taking the proportionality factors @xmath13 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 as experimental parameters . for more details on the modelling , see the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 are shown as a black line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b . </S>",
    "<S> our model can well account for all characteristics of the observed resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis regime of the fluorescence curves is given by the fold - over region ( between @xmath15 and @xmath0 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2]b ) in which three stationary solutions for a fixed detuning exist . </S>",
    "<S> only two solutions are stable , corresponding to the observed fluorescence states , and switching occurs when the edge of the fold - over region is reached ( solid dots ) . as already suggested above , the broad , triangular shape of the resonance results from the dragging - along of the resonance .        </S>",
    "<S> so far , the observed phenomena share some characteristics with the recently observed nuclear - spin - induced dragging and the resulting hysteresis @xcite . in the present system , however , the feedback is based on photoionization in electric fields rather than magnetic interaction with nuclear spins , which makes the response orders of magnitude more rapid and allows for fast manipulation by externally applied voltage or light pulses . </S>",
    "<S> this will be demonstrated in the following .        figure  [ fig-3]a shows how the resonance fluorescence in the hysteresis region is affected by an interruption of the laser excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot is first initialized in the high - fluorescence `` on''-state by laser irradiation and application of a suitable gate voltage . then </S>",
    "<S> , the gate voltage is switched to the hysteresis region ( at time @xmath16 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-3]a ) . at @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> the laser excitation is interrupted for a short , variable time span @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , it is recorded whether the system is in the `` on''-state ( blue curve ) or the `` off''-state ( red curve ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-3]b , the `` on''-state probabilities are plotted as a function of the interruption time @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a latency time ( time required for the `` on''-state probability to drop below 50% ) of roughly @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the fluorescence can be switched on by optical means , using a second laser . </S>",
    "<S> laser  1 is set to the hysteresis region and the qd is initialized in the `` off''-state ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-3]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , for a short pumping time @xmath18 , laser  2 is turned on , which is resonant with the initial exciton frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this populates the hole gas and shifts the transition to higher frequencies , closer to laser  1 in the hysteresis region . depending on the length of the additional laser pulse </S>",
    "<S> , the system will afterwards be in the `` off '' or `` on''-state with respect to laser  1 ( red and blue traces in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-3]c , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , a latency period can be observed , which is @xmath20 for the present experimental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence of the switch - off process is given by the leakage rate of the hole gas ( process ( 3 ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that for very short interruption times @xmath18 , the negative feedback mechanism will ensure a fast recovery of the rf signal . only for sufficiently long @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance position will have shifted far enough that a recovery is no longer possible . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the observed latency time . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the observed latency period of the switch - on process reflects the pumping rate of the hole gas by exciton generation and field ionization . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the particular characteristic times strongly depend on the excitation power and the position of the laser frequency within the bistability region .    </S>",
    "<S> the operation principle of our feedback loop , which is based on simple charge transport and therefore offers great tunability , opens up a broad variety of possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the proposal based on the nuclear dragging effect , the charge driven feedback loop may be used for stabilization of the qd resonance position . </S>",
    "<S> also , the bistability may be useful for optical memory applications , such as switching the fluorescence signal from the `` off '' to the `` on''-state when a short optical signal is received and holding that state for later read - out . </S>"
