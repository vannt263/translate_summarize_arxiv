    "this paper considers the use of importance sampling for estimating hitting or exit probabilities for stochastic processes .",
    "the process model is a @xmath0-dimensional diffusion @xmath1 satisfying the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a standard @xmath0-dimensional wiener process .",
    "of particular interest is the case of gradient flows , @xmath5 , and constant diffusion coefficient , though many aspects of the analysis are more generally applicable .",
    "let @xmath6 be an open set and denote by @xmath7 the exit time of @xmath8 from @xmath9 .",
    "we are concerned with the estimation of quantities such as the probability that @xmath10 leaves @xmath9 before some time @xmath11 , or that it exits through a particular subset @xmath12 before @xmath13 , and related expected values .",
    "the principal novel feature of this work is that the initial point is in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point of the noiseless dynamics .",
    "the estimation of such probabilities has several mathematical and computational difficulties .",
    "it is related to the estimation of transition probabilities between different metastable states within a given time horizon . as is well known , standard monte carlo sampling techniques lead to exponentially large relative errors as the noise coefficient @xmath14 tends to zero . when rest points are in the domain of interest the situation is even more complicated than usual .",
    "this work will focus on this particularly difficult issue .",
    "the performance of unbiased estimators for rare event problems is usually measured by the size of the second moment of the estimator based on a single simulation . for",
    "a well designed scheme the ratio of this second moment to the quantity of interest will not grow too rapidly as @xmath15 .",
    "one measure is the exponential rate of decay of the second moment .",
    "if this rate of decay is exactly twice the decay rate for the probability of interest , then the scheme is called asymptotically efficient ( or weakly efficient ) .",
    "the notion of _ strong _ efficiency requires that the ratio of the second moment to the square of the probability be bounded above uniformly for all small @xmath3 . while such performance is certainly desirable , it is not common when dealing with models such as ( [ eq : diffusion1 ] ) that involve state dependent dynamics and complicated geometries .",
    "as we describe below , in some sense both these measures are inadequate for the situation considered here .    a theory based on subsolutions to an associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation has been developed for the design and performance analysis of importance sampling",
    "( see for example @xcite ) . in this approach",
    "the change of measure ( which for reasons made evident later on we will call the control ) used in the importance sampling is defined in terms of the gradient of a subsolution , and the performance , as measured by the decay rate of the second moment , is given by the value of the subsolution at the initial location @xmath16 .",
    "this theory is the starting point of our analysis of ( [ eq : diffusion1 ] ) , though as mentioned previously the inclusion of rest points will motivate some further developments .    for any particular class of process models and events ,",
    "an essential step in the application of this approach is the construction of appropriate subsolutions . in this paper",
    "we will exploit the fact that the freidlin - wentsell quasipotential @xcite can be used to construct various subsolutions for certain _ time independent _ problems related to ( [ eq : diffusion1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , for particular but important classes of process models ( e.g. , gradient systems with constant diffusion matrix ) , the quasipotential and hence these subsolutions take explicit and simple forms . as we discuss in detail later on , these subsolutions also give subsolutions for the _ time dependent _ problems , and when @xmath13 is large the value of the subsolution at the starting point ( which now includes time @xmath17 as well as the location ) will be close to the maximal value .",
    "it follows that if the final time @xmath13 is large enough , then existing theory implies that the estimator based on this subsolution should have a nearly optimal decay rate for its second moment .",
    "while this is a valid statement , there is an important qualitative difference between problems which include a rest point in the domain of interest and those which do not . the distinction turns not on the decay rate , which behaves as expected in both situations , but rather depends on the pre - exponential terms not captured by the decay rate .",
    "when the domain does not contain a rest point one has simultaneously good rates of decay and control over the pre - exponential terms . however , when a rest point is present schemes based only on this time independent subsolution keep the desired decay rate but lose the good control over the pre - exponential terms .",
    "the qualitative difference is related to the fact that in the former case a subsolution designed on the basis of the @xmath18 problem can be shown to give useful bounds for the problem with @xmath3 , but in the latter case this is no longer true .",
    "this qualitative distinction will be made precise later on , when we construct non - asymptotic bounds on the second moment for the two cases .",
    "when @xmath3 is small but not too small , the loss of performance due to the large pre - exponential term can be significant , rendering the associated importance sampling scheme little better than ordinary monte carlo . as @xmath15 the exponential decay rate dominates , and importance sampling once again gives much greater performance than ordinary monte carlo .",
    "however , the improvement is less than in the case where rest points are not included , and an approach which avoids this loss of performance would certainly be welcome .",
    "one can show that in fact there is no time independent subsolution that will resolve this difficulty , and so one must bring in some form of time dependence .",
    "it is not at all clear how one might incorporate time dependence throughout the entire domain @xmath19\\times\\mathcal{d}$ ] .",
    "an alternative approach , and the one we follow in this paper , is to combine an explicit solution to an approximating time dependent problem in a neighborhood of the rest point with the time independent subsolution obtained via the quasipotential away from the rest point . as we will show , such an approach will maintain the high decay rate while at the same time properly controlling the pre - exponential term .",
    "in the neighborhood of the rest point , one can approximate the dynamics of the diffusion process by a gauss - markov process , i.e. , a process with a constant diffusion matrix and drift that is affine in the state . for these dynamics and appropriate terminal conditions for the localizing problem",
    ", the solution to the related pde can be constructed in terms to the famous linear / quadratic regulator problem from optimal control theory . as a consequence",
    "an explicit and nearly optimal scheme for a surrogate problem can be identified in the neighborhood of the rest point , which is then merged with the explicit scheme based on the quasipotential in that part of the domain where it is particularly effective .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the difficulties caused by the presence of rest points in a general setting .",
    "we describe and theoretically justify a resolution of these difficulties in the case of dimension one , and present computational data for this case .",
    "the construction of the localizing problem is more elaborate in dimension greater than one , and will be presented in a companion paper along with the results of numerical experiments in higher dimensions .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in section [ s : ldpandis ]",
    "we review the relevant large deviation theory and importance sampling . in section [ s : effectivenessofsubsolutions ] we discuss the effectiveness of time independent subsolutions . in particular , we show that if rest points are not part of the domain of interest then subsolutions lead to both good decay rates and non - asymptotic bounds for the second moment of the corresponding unbiased estimator .",
    "however , when rest points are included in the domain of interest , the situation is more complicated and even if the decay rate is good , the prelimit bounds may not be as good as desired . in section [ s : linearproblem ] , we present a change of measure for the problem with a rest point for a quadratic potential function with provably good pre - asymptotic and asymptotic performance and which does not degrade as @xmath13 gets larger . in section [ s : nonlinearproblem ]",
    "we extend the discussion to the nonlinear problem with rest points .",
    "simulation data , demonstrating the discussions in sections [ s : linearproblem ] and [ s : nonlinearproblem ] are also presented in the corresponding sections .",
    "the appendix has some auxiliary lemmas that are used in the main body of the manuscript .",
    "in this section we recall well known large deviation results for probabilities of exit times ( subsection [ ss : ldp ] ) , review importance sampling in the context of small noise diffusions ( subsection [ ss : is ] ) , and also recall the notion of subsolutions to certain related hjb equations ( subsection [ ss : roleofsubsolutions ] ) .    in most of this paper the following assumptions will be used .",
    "the assumptions are stronger than necessary , but simplify the discussion considerably .",
    "for example , the non - degeneracy of the diffusion matrix and regularity of the boundary of @xmath9 easily imply that a limit exists for ( [ eq : estimationtarget2 ] )",
