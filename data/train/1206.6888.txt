    "in  @xcite atlas and cms have measured the @xmath0 cross section using the full @xmath2fb lhc7 dataset .",
    "atlas measured a cross section of @xmath3  pb compared with a nlo theory prediction of @xmath4 pb , while cms found a cross section of @xmath5  pb compared to a nlo theory prediction of @xmath6  pb .",
    "both of these results are consistent within the error bars , but they are also both high and more consistent with each other than with the sm .",
    "even more recently , cms released a measurement of the sm @xmath0 cross section at 8 tev  @xcite that was also higher than the sm cross section and even more discrepant with the sm than the 7 tev measurement  @xcite .",
    "understanding the @xmath0 cross section is crucial for higgs searches as well as any new physics search containing more than one lepton . in this letter",
    ", we investigate the consequences for new physics that could be responsible for the enhanced values of the measured @xmath0 cross sections .    in @xcite",
    "the @xmath0 cross section was measured in the fully leptonic final state .",
    "these analyses were designed to measure the sm , not to exclude new physics , which is reflected in their rather inclusive cuts .",
    "therefore , new physics that produces os leptons and met could be present in these measurements .",
    "based on the differential distributions in  @xcite , new physics that contaminates these measurements would have to have kinematics at least similar to sm @xmath0 events , otherwise there would be an obvious discrepancy . while it is quite probable that the discrepancies in the total cross section and differential distributions are due to insufficient background modeling ,",
    "we demonstrate that sm nlo @xmath0 combined with the inclusion of new ew processes fits the data significantly better than the current sm prediction alone .",
    "supersymmetry provides an example of new physics that could significantly affect ew cross section measurements .",
    "in particular , light ewinos provide a production and decay mechanism to generate multigauge boson final states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prod ] for a gauge - mediated scenario .",
    "while colored particles typically have bounds of @xmath7 , charginos can in principle be as light as @xmath8  @xcite , and even massless neutralinos are compatible with all collider constraints  @xcite .",
    "for ewinos with masses @xmath8 , the production cross section is @xmath9 pb for @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the lhc , precisely the range of interest for explaining the @xmath0 cross section discrepancy from the nlo sm prediction .",
    "accounting for the @xmath0 discrepancy fixes the cross section and mass scale , which turns out to automatically dictate that the kinematics of onshell w s from @xmath10 decays are very similar to the sm . in this letter",
    "we will demonstrate that @xmath12 of the @xmath0 measurement is significantly better for all atlas and cms distributions when ewinos are included .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 production , @xmath13  , @xmath14  and @xmath15  + met final states are generically also produced via @xmath16 production .",
    "however , current bounds on the @xmath13  and @xmath14  final state are quite strong  @xcite .",
    "we show that there are several classes of models where the @xmath0 discrepancy can be accounted for without being in conflict with existing experimental searches .",
    "weak scale gauginos not only affect sm multi - gauge boson measurements but also can effect higgs phenomenology and measurements .",
    "if new physics were to contaminate the signal and control regions of the @xmath17  search , a higgs discovery  @xcite in this channel could be affected  @xcite .",
    "given the similar kinematics to sm @xmath0 we find that the presence of ewinos would only be manifest as an upscaling of the sm @xmath0 background in the control region to match the data .",
    "the presence of very light ewinos could also create new higgs production channels and modify loop induced decay processes .",
    "for example , new contributions to @xmath14 production can be realized with ewinos . for decays , ewinos themselves",
    "can modify the @xmath18  rate in a number of ways  @xcite , however this is also correlated to the production cross section for ewinos themselves . without specifying the mechanism of generating a 125 gev higgs in susy ,",
    "which is not necessarily coupled to the @xmath0 cross section , it is impossible to make definite predictions for changes in higgs phenomenology .    in the rest of this letter",
    ", we will quantitatively demonstrate the effects of a particular susy scenario for the @xmath0 measurement at 7 tev and 8 tev .",
    "we then investigate the bounds on these scenarios , and their contributions to other multi - gauge boson and higgs measurements / searches .",
    "finally we discuss the impact of this scenario and possible ways to test for it and other closely related scenarios in the future .",
    "while the discrepancies in @xmath0 may simply be due to background modeling , this letter clearly demonstrates that ew charginos could have been hiding in plain sight , and can improve a number of sm measurements done thus far at the lhc .",
    "c   +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     given that the 7 tev measurements of atlas and cms can not rule out the sm with their current level of precision , it is still possible that both atlas and cms both measured an upwards fluctuation at 7 tev .",
    "however , if new physics was the cause of the discrepancy with the sm , then the @xmath0 cross section at 8 tev should also be high . as mentioned in the introduction , this",
    "was recently shown to be the case by cms  @xcite .",
    "the lhc8 measured value from cms is @xmath19  pb with an nlo sm prediction of @xmath20pb .",
    "recently , the 8 tev lhc nlo ew corrections were also computed  @xcite , and the effect on the total cross section from ew corrections is negative which would only increase the discrepancy .    in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the contribution from both charginos and the higgs to the differential distributions from  @xcite .",
    "since the cross section discrepancy has grown compared to the atlas lhc7 results , the agreement of the sm prediction with the data is quite poor , and computing @xmath12 for all the plots yields a combined @xmath21-value of @xmath22 ( assuming approximately gaussian errors ) . similar to lhc7 results , the inclusion of the charginos reduces the @xmath12 by about a factor of 2 , significantly improving the @xmath21-value of the combined fit to 0.3 for charginos + sm . the contribution of the higgs to the @xmath0 measurement is larger at 8 tev than at 7 tev , but is still subdominant to the charginos in improving the fit , and in the differential distributions it enters in different kinematic regimes than the chargino contribution .",
    "adding only the higgs contributions improves the @xmath21-value to @xmath23 , while adding both the higgs and chargino contributions yields a combined @xmath21-value of @xmath24 , a very significant improvement .",
    "for particles charged under the electroweak symmetries alone the lhc bounds are weaker than for strongly interacting particles . this is mostly due to the decreased production cross section , resulting in a lower mass reach , but also because the lower mass scale implies kinematic distributions more similar to the sm in many cases  such as the one we are considering in this letter .",
    "nevertheless , recent lhc searches @xcite are starting to approach the sensitivity necessary to exclude @xmath25 electroweakinos , and we have to examine the bounds carefully .    in principle many susy scenarios could give rise to a shift in sm @xmath0 measurements .",
    "perhaps the most obvious example is gravity mediation with wino - like charginos that have a mass of @xmath26 along with a light bino - like neutralino lsp , and @xmath27 .",
    "however , @xmath28 associated production followed by a @xmath29 decay produces a trilepton signal that is completely excluded by recent altas trilepton bounds @xcite , regardless of whether the @xmath30 is on- or off - shell .",
    "one could imagine diluting the trilepton signal by increasing @xmath31 to open up the @xmath32 decay , but in this case the resulting @xmath33 final state is excluded by @xmath34 searches @xcite .",
    "gravity - mediation could still provide a viable scenario if sleptons are lighter than the ewinos , in which case their pair production would contribute to the @xmath35 + met final state , while the decay of ewinos to sleptons + soft leptons might ameliorate the trilepton signal .",
    "we will examine this scenario in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the benchmark scenario of the previous sections is realized within gauge mediation , where @xmath36 , low @xmath37 and a large degree of wino - higgsino mixing can produce the _ chargino - nlsp _ spectrum we described .",
    "before we examine the bounds on this scenario in detail there are two other choices of nlsp to consider : bino neutralino and wino neutralino .    in the _ bino - nlsp _ scenario , the bino decay @xmath38 leaves a striking diphoton signature for susy production . as outlined in @xcite , lhc diphoton + met searches @xcite exclude chargino pair production and decay for @xmath39 , making their pair production cross section too small to enhance the measured @xmath0 cross section .",
    "photon constraints can be partially avoided with a _ wino - like nlsp _ : for @xmath36 with low wino - higgsino mixing the neutralino - chargino mass - splitting is so small that @xmath40 decays directly to @xmath41 , making it a chargino co - nlsp and avoiding stringent diphoton + met bounds .",
    "@xmath42 associated production still produces some single - photon signal ( depending on the branching ratios of @xmath38 vs @xmath43 ) , and a cdf @xmath44 search excludes @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "a chargino at this mass could somewhat ameliorate the discrepancy in the measured @xmath0 cross section , but @xmath46 is high enough for new atlas trilepton bounds @xcite to completely exclude this scenario as well .",
    "we are therefore left with the chargino - nlsp scenario as the only possible realization of gauge mediation to contribute significantly to the @xmath0 final state .",
    "the trilepton signal is suppressed ( though not completely absent , due to the non - negligible @xmath47-@xmath48 mass difference ) , but chargino - neutralino production produces a significant amount of _ same - sign dilepton _ signal , making constraints from new atlas dilepton searches @xcite relevant .",
    "we simulated the signal produced by our scenario in these searches @xcite using the same monte - carlo setup as for the @xmath0 cross section measurement .",
    "each search is still consistent well within one sigma , though it could be possible for same - sign dilepton searches to discover this scenario with the full 8 tev lhc data set .",
    "given the current bounds on trilepton @xcite signatures , any new physics must primarily affect only the @xmath0 cross section , leaving @xmath13  and @xmath15  mostly unaffected .    to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the gravity mediated scenario discussed in the previous section , with winos always decaying to a bino - like neutralino lsp via on - shell @xmath49 s and @xmath30 s . in this case",
    "the trilepton bounds push the allowed mass of the winos to @xmath50 , which makes the wino pair production cross section so small that the @xmath51 improvement of the @xmath0 measurement is negligible , less than @xmath52 .",
    "since our chargino nlsp scenario evades these trilepton bounds there is no affect on multi - gauge boson phenomenology other than multi-@xmath49 .",
    "there will be signatures of same - sign @xmath49 gauge boson production with additional soft jets or leptons arising from @xmath16 production and decay .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , same - sign dilepton searches @xcite are not yet sensitive enough to rule out this signal .",
    "the possibly viable gravity mediated scenario with intermediate sleptons @xcite could feature additional `` gauge boson '' signatures , because in addition to producing @xmath53 final states ( even though no @xmath49 s are involved ) there is also the possibility for @xmath54 production , showing up in single @xmath49-measurements .",
    "modifying the effective @xmath0 cross section through bsm contributions could significantly affect @xmath17  measurements since both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite searches use data - driven techniques to estimate @xmath0 background .",
    "the monte carlo output is normalized to fit the data in a control region , and that  renormalization \" is carried over into the signal region .",
    "however , we find that generically the higgs search sensitivities are not modified . in a bsm scenario like ours , where the kinematics are very similar to @xmath0 ,",
    "the control and signal regions are contaminated in proportion to @xmath0 , and the upscaling of the @xmath0 contribution in the control region correctly ` predicts ' the bsm background in the signal region . on the other hand ,",
    "the examples studied by @xcite , which preferentially contaminate the control region due to their kinematics being very different from @xmath0 , are excluded by trilepton searches @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if there was a scenario that did not fall into either of these categories , i.e. contaminating preferentially the control region without generating a large trilepton signal .",
    "light ewinos can also generate higgs production that mimics associated @xmath14  production to the point that it becomes a constraint , as shown previously . in principle there could be some contribution to @xmath14  , but as an example we can look at a gravity mediated scenario with a bino - like neutralino lsp and a higgsino - like nlsp , such that @xmath55 always leads a final state of @xmath56 . to avoid constraints from existing @xmath14  measurements requires a mass scale of @xmath57 .",
    "however , the high higgsino fraction in this case lowers the cross section for @xmath10 and the improvement of the @xmath58 for @xmath0 is @xmath59 . therefore similar to @xmath13",
    "there is typically no signature in @xmath14  when an appreciable effect is measurable in the @xmath0 cross section .    as a final avenue",
    ", light ewinos can also modify loop induced decay processes of the higgs , or in principle provide new decay modes for the higgs . in our particular benchmark scenario this is manifested as a 15% increase in the partial width of @xmath18  .",
    "this is of course tantalizing given the fact that both atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite observed an increased rate of @xmath18  compared to the sm in their discoveries of a higgs like state .",
    "however , within the context of the susy the higgs mass is tightly intertwined with the resulting phenomenology more so than in other models , thus without specifying how to generate a 125 gev higgs there could be other much larger contributions that affect higgs production and decay to the point where a generic prediction based solely on accounting for the @xmath0 cross section is impossible .",
    "it is certainly interesting to tie together the higgs properties and a modified ew sector which can account for the increased @xmath0 measurement , and we will report on this in  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the current @xmath0 cross section measurements favor the inclusion of a chargino contribution compared to the sm @xmath0 prediction alone .",
    "this is not in conflict with any existing constraints , and improves the measurement at both lhc7 and lhc8 thus far . given that the nlo sm prediction does not properly predict the data s normalization or shape in three independent measurements , it seems likely that there is either a significant gap in our understanding of the sm calculation _ or _ we are possibly getting a glimpse of new physics right at the ew scale . either of these outcomes obviously carry profound consequences both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "any scenario involving new physics will have other experimental consequences which should be searched for while also improving the precision of the sm @xmath0 measurement . in the particular susy example that we put forward , continued multi - lepton studies should hopefully shed light on this scenario by the end of the lhc8 run .",
    "however , exclusion is intertwined with understanding the sm measurement and will become increasingly complicated if new physics is in this regime .",
    "we have presented results for one benchmark susy scenario , however there are others that also can significantly improve the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "there are additional possibilities beyond those presented here  @xcite , but clearly this letter should serve as a clarion call to both the theoretical and experimental communities to understand @xmath0 production better .      we would like to thank antonio delgado , elliot lipeles , rohini godbole , sanjay padhi , marc - andre pleier , and james wells for useful discussions . d.c .",
