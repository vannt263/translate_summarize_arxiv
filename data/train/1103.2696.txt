    ", we get @xmath3-identifiability for @xmath356 .",
    "it is an improvement , but still a long way from @xmath357 .",

    "we are able to prove that @xmath67 is _ not _",
    "@xmath6-identifiable , and the general point in @xmath360 sits in exactly two @xmath6-secant , @xmath47-planes . from the tensorial point of view",
    ", this means that a general @xmath361 tensor of rank @xmath6 , can be written as a sum of @xmath6 decomposable tensors in exactly @xmath33 ways ( up to scalar multiplication and permutations ) .",
    "the reason relies in the fact that through @xmath6 general points @xmath362 of @xmath359 , one can draw an elliptic normal curve @xmath363 of degree @xmath364 , which spans a projective space @xmath365 , containing the linear span of @xmath362 .",
    "so , a general point @xmath366 lies in a linear space @xmath160 spanned by an elliptic normal curve @xmath367 . by @xcite ,",
    "proposition 5.2 , it is known that @xmath363 has @xmath6-secant order @xmath33 , i.e. there are exactly two @xmath47-planes , @xmath6-secant to @xmath363 , inside @xmath160 . by @xcite proposition 2.4 , if we prove that @xmath363 coincides with the contact locus of a general @xmath6-tangent hyperplane , also @xmath67 must have @xmath6-secant order equal to @xmath33 .",
    "this last fact can be checked by our macaulay2 algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , the existence of an elliptic normal curve , of degree @xmath364 , passing through @xmath6 randomly chosen points of @xmath67 , gives only a probabilistic argument for the existence of such a curve passing through @xmath6 general points of @xmath67 .",
    "to overcome this problem , we offer the following theoretical argument",
    ".    consider the projections @xmath368 of @xmath362 , into the @xmath369-th copy of @xmath370 , so that @xmath368 are general points of @xmath370 .",
    "normal elliptic curves @xmath9 passing through the @xmath6 points of @xmath370 are given by pairs of quadrics through the points , so they are parametrized by the grassmannian @xmath371 of lines in the space @xmath370 of quadrics through @xmath368 . in order",
    "that three normal elliptic curves @xmath372 in the three copies of @xmath370 , correspond to the same abstract curve , they need to differ by an element of @xmath373 .",
    "so , once we have @xmath9 ( @xmath49 parameters ) , we can choose @xmath374 for the two remaining maps @xmath375 ( thus a total of @xmath376 parameters ) .",
    "on the other hand , we need to impose that @xmath377 ( resp @xmath378 ) pass through @xmath379 ( resp .",
    "@xmath380 ) .",
    "since each point imposes @xmath33 conditions , we get a total of @xmath381 algebraic conditions on the @xmath382 parameters .",
    "moreover , if we want that after this correspondence , @xmath372 are projection of the same curve passing through @xmath362 , we also need that the projectivity @xmath383 ( resp .",
    "@xmath384 ) , composed with the automorphisms of the curves which sends @xmath385 to @xmath386 ( resp . @xmath385 to @xmath387 ) , also sends any @xmath388 to @xmath389 ( resp .",
    "@xmath388 to @xmath390 ) , for @xmath391 .",
    "this gives @xmath392 more conditions , which are algebraic on the coefficients of the two quadrics and the entries of the matrices of @xmath393 .",
    "so , we have a total of @xmath382 conditions , which are algebraic on the @xmath382 parameters , i.e. on the projective coordinates of @xmath394 .",
    "thus we get at least a finite number of curves passing through @xmath362 , for a general choice of the points .",
    ".5 cm    in the previous example , notice that when the three projections of the points @xmath98 differ by a projectivity , then the number of conditions decreases , and we find infinitely many normal elliptic curves .",
    "it is easy to see that this implies that a point in the secant variety @xmath395 of any of these curves , belongs indeed to infinitely many @xmath6-secant spaces .",
    "the case of products of projective spaces of dimension @xmath131 is particularly interesting , due to its applications to statistical studies on dna strings .",
    "if we have many substrings of dna strings , each formed by three positions , and we record the occurrence of the four bases in each position , we get a distribution which can be arranged in a @xmath5 tensor @xmath396 .",
    "the rank @xmath3 of @xmath396 suggests the existence of @xmath3 different types of substrings , in the probe , such that for each type , the distribution of bases is independent .",
    "so @xmath396 is the sum of @xmath3 tensors @xmath397 , of rank @xmath0 .",
    "an obvious question concerns the possibility of recovering the @xmath3 tensors @xmath398 , starting from @xmath396 . when @xmath399 , this possibility is excluded , since @xmath400 exceeds the maximum given in proposition [ maxk ] . for @xmath401 ,",
    "@xmath3-identifiability ( by kruskal s criterion ) tells us that , at least theoretically , the reconstruction is possible .",
    "the amazing situation happens for @xmath58 .",
    "although one could expect @xmath6-identifiability , theorem [ main3 ] shows that there are exactly two sets of tensors of rank @xmath0 , whose sum is @xmath396 .",
    "hence , at least over the complex field , there are exactly two different sets of distributions , in the @xmath6 types , that produce the same distribution @xmath396",
