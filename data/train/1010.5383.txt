    "is a g5 star , at a distance of  58.4  pc , which is distinguished by being orbited by a planet with one of the highest known orbital eccentricities .",

    "all of the giant planets in the solar system and the generate radio emission as a result of an interaction between the solar wind and the planetary magnetosphere .",
    "specifically , the solar wind impinging on the planetary magnetosphere generates currents within the magnetosphere which are then directed into the planet s magnetic polar regions where an electron cyclotron maser instability is produced . motivated by the radio emission from solar system planets , there have been a number of searches for magnetospherically generated radio emission from extrasolar planets , at frequencies ranging from  25  mhz to  1400  mhz @xcite .",
    "sensitivities ( 1@xmath1 ) have ranged from roughly 1000  mjy to below  1  mjy , with generally better sensitivities obtained at the higher frequencies .",
    "typically , these sensitivities have not been sufficient to challenge the predicted levels of extrasolar planetary magnetospheric emission , though some recent multi - epoch 74  mhz observations of @xmath9  boo @xcite do indicate that its planet s emission is not consistent with the most optimistic predictions , unless the emission is either at a frequency well below  74  mhz or is much more strongly beamed than that of solar system planets .",
    "most recent radio observations of planets have focused on planets in orbits with relatively small semi - major axes and low eccentricities ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "part of the motivation for this focus is the stellar wind powering of the electron cyclotron maser instability .",
    "close to the host star , the stellar wind should be more intense with a concomitant increase in the strength of the planetary radio emission .",
    "a secondary cause is the result of a selection effect .",
    "planets close to their host stars produce the largest radial velocity signature , and the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have been found with the radial velocity method .",
    "a concern with this focus on so - called hot jupiters is that they are likely to be tidally locked to their host star , with rotation periods of order a few days . to the extent that rapid rotation may be necessary for",
    "the generation of a strong planetary magnetic field , these `` hot jupiters '' may have weak fields that do not generate much electron cyclotron maser emission or generate it at a frequency well below that accessible from the ground .",
    "absent a direct radio detection of magnetically generated emission , evidence for extrasolar planetary magnetic fields is ambiguous .",
    "consistent with the scenario of weak fields , @xcite were unable to find any unambiguous signal of aurorally generated uv emission from the `` hot jupiter '' . from this",
    "they derive a limit on the intrinsic planetary magnetic moment of  0.01  @xmath10 , but perhaps as large as 0.1  @xmath10 , if the interaction with the stellar magnetic field is important . in turn",
    ", this limit implies a magnetic field strength of only 10% that of .",
    "@xcite argue that ohmic dissipation could explain the inflated atmospheres of `` hot jupiters , '' and they are able to explain the atmospheres of , , and assuming a field strength of  10  g at the cloud tops , as compared to the value of  4.2  g for .",
    "strictly , their estimate ( @xmath11  g ) is an upper limit because ohmic dissipation need not be the only effect operating to inflate `` hot jupiter '' atmospheres .",
    "@xcite show that the asymmetric transit properties of might be able to be explained by a magnetopause , if the planetary magnetic field strength is of order 1  , but their model also has a fairly weak dependence on the magnetic field strength ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "conversely , a small number of stars with `` hot jupiters '' show evidence for star - planet interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which appear to have a magnetic component .",

    "the data were acquired in a spectral - line mode both to enable the identification and excision of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and for the purposes of wide - field imaging .",

    "it is clear that our luminosity limits remain several orders of magnitude ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) above the luminosity of .",
    "the original motivation for these observations was the expectation that the high eccentricity of the planet s orbit could produce a dramatic variation in the strength of the planet s radio emission . because a planet s magnetospheric emission is controlled by the input stellar wind power ,",

    "@xcite consider more complex stellar wind models , but a strong dependence on the planet - star distance remains .    over the course of the planet s orbit , from apastron to periastron , we therefore expect that the luminosity of  could vary by a factor of  200 . even at apastron",
    "( 0.87  au ) ,  is still closer to  than is to the .",
    "if we consider the further boost that could be obtained by moving a jovian - like planet from a distance of  5  au to  0.87  , the boost would be a factor of  16 .",
    "thus , one might expect that , near periastron ,  could be as much as a factor of 3000 times more luminous than",
    ". however , even an increase by a factor of order 3000 over jupiter s luminosity would be insufficient to increase  to a level comparable to our detection thresholds .",
    "a simple explanation for our non - detections is therefore that , even with the added boost due to the small planet - star distance during periastron , the planet s luminosity remains too low to be detected with current equipment .",
    "there are several other factors , however , that could also explain our non - detection .",
    "one possibility is that the radio emission is not beamed in our direction . in the case of",

    "is one of the rapidly growing class of transiting extrasolar planets , and recent transit observations demonstrate that there is a significant spin - orbit misalignment ( @xmath19 ) in this system @xcite . for a transiting planet",
    "whose rotational axis is aligned with the stellar rotation axis and _ no _ spin - orbit misalignment , the probability of intercepting the emission beam would be relatively small .",
    "however , the existing spin - orbit misalignment in this system increases the probability that emission beam intersects the line of sight . of course , it is possible that the emission cone of  is much smaller than that of , such that the probability of intercept remains quite low .",
    "a second possibility is that the expected upper frequency limit of emission is ( well ) below our observation frequencies .",
    "the intense cyclotron maser emission of cuts off dramatically at frequencies above approximately 40  mhz , as the local plasma frequency in the polar emitting region exceeds the electron cyclotron frequency and the radio emission can not escape .",
    "for most extrasolar planets , one can estimate the upper frequency limit by scaling their magnetic moments from that of .",
    "previous estimates for the magnetic moment , and upper frequency limit , for  have varied wildly .",
    "@xcite estimated an upper frequency limit of around 180  mhz , while @xcite estimated 0.8  mhz .",
    "the combination of the eccentric orbit and the planetary transits , however , now provide sufficient information to estimate , with relatively low uncertainty , the upper emission frequency .",
    "this upper emission frequency is given by @xcite @xmath20 for a given planetary mass  @xmath21 , rotation and radius  @xmath22 .",
    "in practice , this value may underestimate the actual upper emission frequency , as the case for is @xmath23  mhz whereas equation  ( [ eqn : freq ] ) suggests 24  mhz .",
    "this expression also assumes that the planetary magnetic dipole is not offset significantly ( as it is for the planets and ) , which can produce significant asymmetric emission .    of the various determinations of the mass and radius of the planet @xcite",
    ", we adopt those that @xcite obtained from a bayesian analysis of all of the data available to them .",
    "they found a planetary mass of @xmath24  @xmath25 and a radius of @xmath26  @xmath27 , implying a density about four times higher than that of ; their models also suggest that the core mass of  could be several times that of .",
    "@xcite discusses the tidal effects in eccentric systems .",
    "the large eccentricity for the orbit of  should have driven it into a state of pseudo - synchronization between its rotation and orbital periods .",
    "using expressions derived by @xcite , we estimate a ( pseudo - synchronized ) rotational period of  39.9  hr .    evaluating equation  ( [ eqn : freq ] ) , we find that the upper emission frequency of approximately 55  mhz , and potentially as high as 90  mhz , if one accounts for the 50% difference between the actual value for and that predicted by equation  ( [ eqn : freq ] )",
    ". it is clear that this upper emission frequency is well below that of our observations .",
    "this estimate for the emission frequency differs from that of @xcite by only a factor of  23 , but it differs from that obtained by @xcite by a factor of order @xmath28 .",
    "we believe that the differences can be attributed to assumptions of the rotation period .",
    "@xcite assumed a rotation period equal to that of , which is within a factor of  4 of the rotation period we adopt here .",
    "however , @xcite identified the planet as `` tidally locked , '' which would mean that it would have an extremely slow rotation rate , and therefore a low magnetic moment and low emission frequency .",
    "one of the key factors that may have led @xcite to identify the planet as tidally locked is that they appear to have used expressions for estimating the synchronization time scale which assume a circular orbit ( their appendix  b ) .",
    "we consider the possibilities of future observations from two perspectives .",
    "first , are there planets other than  that should be targeted ? second , what are the prospects for future instruments to detect ?    while ,  is not the only known planet with a high - eccentricity orbit , it appears the most promising for future radio observations .",
    "is a 1.9  @xmath25 ( minimum mass ) planet in an orbit with an eccentricity of  0.97 and an orbital period of  592  days @xcite , and is a 1.6  @xmath25 ( minimum mass ) planet in an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.903 and an orbital period of 527  days @xcite . the pseudo - synchronization rotational period is coupled to the orbital period , so these longer orbital periods imply substantially larger rotational periods , as compared to .",
    "we estimate rotational periods of 63.8  hr and 14  days for and , respectively . combined with their lower masses , equation  ( [ eqn : freq ] )",
    "suggests that their emission frequencies are likely to be below  20  mhz . unless future surveys reveal planets with masses and orbital eccentricities comparable to those of  ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears likely to remain the most promising target for radio observations of ( high - eccentricity ) planets .    with respect to observations of",
    ", our analysis suggests that future observations must be both more sensitive and at a lower frequency than those that we report here .",
    "there are several observing systems that are either under construction or in the design phase that we now consider .",
    "the expanded very large array ( evla ) project exposed certain shortcomings of the vla s 74 mhz system @xcite , primarily its generation of harmonics at higher frequencies that fall within the evla s operational spectral window .",
    "consequently , the nrl has funded the national radio astronomy observatory to develop a new suite of low - frequency receivers . with the previous 74 mhz vla system , automated data processing of approximately a 1 hr observation",
    "could obtain rms intensity levels of order 100  @xcite , while more focused efforts on longer observations could obtain noise levels of  25  @xcite . at a minimum , the new `` evla - low band '' system will have a substantially larger bandwidth .",
    "there has also been continuing algorithmic improvements in the areas of rfi identification and excision and ionospheric calibration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an ansatz , we assume that a combination of algorithmic improvements and the larger bandwidth could produce an approximate factor of  10 improvement in sensitivity , i.e. , 3  .",
    "the resulting ( 3@xmath1 ) luminosity limit would then be @xmath29  erg  s@xmath4 ( for an assumed 10  mhz intrinsic emission bandwidth of the electron cyclotron maser emission ) .",
    "this value is comparable to our more stringent limit ( at  1425  mhz ) , but it would be at a frequency at which emission might more likely be detected .    the low frequency array ( lofar ) is currently under construction in the netherlands and other european countries .",
    "when complete , it will consist of many dipole phased - array stations , operating in a `` high band '' ( hba ) and a `` low band '' ( lba ) .",
    "lofar - lba band will cover the frequency range 3080  mhz , with a peak sensitivity around  60  mhz , well matched to the expected emission frequency of .",
    "current estimates for the sensitivity of lofar - lba are that it will produce a similar or slightly better thermal noise level ( about  7  in a 1 hr integration ) as the evla - low band system .",
    "we emphasize that the limiting factor in imaging sensitivity might very well not be the thermal noise level , but other factors such as ionospheric calibration .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that the lofar - lba band system would produce similar constraints .    following the evla - low band , , and",
    "other pathfinder systems are likely to be the low - frequency component of the square kilometre array ( ska - lo ) and ultimately a low frequency array on the moon ( the lunar radio array ) .",
    "the current design goal for ska - lo has a lower operational frequency of  70  mhz with enough collecting area that the notional thermal noise level would be of order 10  in a 1 hr integration .",
    "unfortunately , candidate sites for the ska - lo are in the southern hemisphere ( australia and south africa , terrestrial latitude @xmath30 ) , from which  can not be observed .",
    "if future planetary surveys detect other -like planets and if the thermal noise level can be approached with the ska - lo , the implied luminosity limit would then be @xmath31  erg  s@xmath4 , well within the range we estimate might be plausible based on the larger stellar wind loading of s magnetosphere .",
