    "several possible mechanisms for forming imbhs in star clusters have recently been suggested .",
    "miller & hamilton ( 2001 ) have studied the possibility that an imbh may form slowly ( on a hubble time scale ) by occasionally encountering and devouring other cluster stars .",

    "we consider the possibility of forming a massive object in a young star cluster due to repeated collisions during an early phase of core collapse",
    ".    sanders ( 1970 ) , lee ( 1987 ) , and quinlan & shapiro ( 1990 ) have studied the possibility of collision runaways in spherical stellar systems of @xmath15 stars with high ( @xmath16 ) velocity dispersions .",
    "all studies began with stars of equal masses and found that , for sufficiently high densities and velocity dispersions , runaway mergers could indeed occur .",
    "quinlan & shapiro observed that the collision time scale for massive stars decreases faster with increasing mass than does the main - sequence lifetime , and concluded that clusters with initial relaxation times of 1@xmath17 years could grow a massive @xmath18 object by multiple mergers .",
    "sanders ( 1970 ) monte - carlo calculations neglected the effects of mass segregation and found collision runaways only after mergers had driven the cluster into a state of high central density .",
    "however , in the self - consistent fokker  planck models of lee and quinlan & shapiro , the runaway started well before core collapse occurred .",
    "all authors concluded that runaways would not occur in clusters containing less than @xmath19 stars because three - body binary heating in small @xmath20-systems provided sufficient energy to reverse core collapse before the runaway process could begin .",
    "in contrast to the studies just described , the models discussed in this paper begin with a broad range of stellar masses .",
    "vishniac ( 1978 ) demonstrated that a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function is spitzer ( 1969 ) unstable . as a result",
    ", young star clusters may experience core collapse on the time scale on which the most massive stars segregate to the cluster center .",
    "this time scale may be much shorter than the main sequence lifetimes of the stars involved .",
    "vishniac suggested that such a prompt collapse might lead to the formation of a massive compact object .",
    "we find that early core collapse in a relatively low-@xmath20 star cluster may result in a collision runaway , so long as the most massive stars remain on the main sequence while the collapse occurs .",
    "the possibility of multiple collisions involving the same star in a dense star cluster was demonstrated convincingly by portegies zwart et al .",

    "1997 ) to speed up their direct n - body calculations with up to 12288 stars .",
    "they concluded that , even in small clusters , runaway collisions may lead to the growth of a single massive star .",
    "the earlier arguments that three - body binary heating would drive the expansion of the cluster core appear to be unimportant in these simulations , as mergers between stars tend to destroy binaries before they can heat the cluster effectively .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the underlying assumptions of previous collision studies , dynamically formed binaries in dense clusters act as a _ catalyst _ for stellar mergers , boosting the collision rate far beyond the simple two - body expressions used in earlier work .",
    "the n - body simulations covered a rather limited part of the available parameter space , but the initial conditions were selected to mimic known dense star clusters in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud .",
    "if the bright x - ray source in m82 does indeed correspond to a compact object of @xmath21 , this imbh could have been formed by a collision runaway resulting from collapse of the cluster core early in the cluster . in fact , as we will see , it is quite natural to expect a @xmath22 black hole in a million - solar - mass star cluster .",
    "we begin by deriving (  2 ) some simple analytic expressions describing the dynamical behavior observed in cluster simulations . in ",

    "realistic clusters have a broad range in initial stellar masses , generally from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , with mean mass @xmath31 ranging from @xmath32 ( salpeter 1955 ) to about 0.65 ( scalo 1986 ) , depending on the specific mass function adopted . during the early evolution of the cluster ,",
    "massive stars sink toward the cluster center via dynamical friction . approximating the cluster structure as an isothermal sphere , we find ( binney & tremaine 1987 , eq .",
    "7 - 25 ) that a star of mass @xmath33 at distance @xmath34 from the cluster center drifts inward at a rate given by @xmath35 here is the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "using eq.[eq : trlx_ii ] , we can integrate eq.[eq : tdf_cgs ] with respect to time to obtain the dynamical friction inspiral time scale @xmath36 this is the time taken for a star of mass @xmath33 to sink to the cluster center from a circular orbit at initial distance @xmath37 .    in a multi - mass system",
    ", core collapse is driven by the accumulation of the most massive stars in the cluster center .",
    "this process takes place on a dynamical friction time scale ( eq.[eq : tdf ] ) .",
    "empirically , we find , for initial mass functions of interest here , that core collapse ( actually , the appearance of the first persistent dynamically formed binary systems ) occurs at about @xmath38 this core collapse time is taken in the limit where stellar evolution is unimportant , i.e.  where stellar mass loss is negligible and the most massive stars survive until they reach the cluster center",
    ".    the collapse of the cluster core may initiate physical collisions between stars .",
    "the product of the first collision is likely to be among the most massive stars in the system , and to be in the core .",
    "this star is therefore likely to experience subsequent collisions , resulting in a collision runaway ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ) . the maximum mass that can be grown in a dense star cluster if all collisions involve the same star is , where @xmath39 here and are the average collision rate and the average mass increase per collision ( assumed independent ) .",
    "we now discuss these quantities in more detail . in  3 we present some n - body results that both motivated and calibrate the following discussion .      a key result from our simulations is the fact that collisions between stars generally occur in dynamically formed ( `` three - body '' ) binaries .",
    "the collision rate is therefore closely related to the binary formation rate , which we now estimate .",
    "the flux of energy through the half - mass radius of a cluster during one half - mass relaxation time is on the order of 10% of the cluster potential energy , largely independent of the total number of stars or the details of the cluster s internal structure ( goodman 1987 ) . for a system without primordial binaries this flux",
    "is produced by heating due to dynamically formed binaries ( makino & hut 1990 ) .",
    "it is released partly in the form of scattering products which remain bound to the system , and partly in the form of potential energy removed from the system by escapers recoiling out of the cluster ( hut & inagaki 1985 ) .",
    "makino & hut argue , for an equal - mass system , that a binary generates an amount of energy on the order of @xmath40 via binary  single - star scattering ( where the total kinetic energy of the stellar system is @xmath41 ) .",
    "this quantity originates from the minimum binding energy of a binary that can eject itself following a strong encounter . assuming that the large - scale energy flux in the cluster is ultimately powered by binary heating in the core .",
    "it follows that the required formation rate of binaries via three - body encounters is @xmath42 for systems containing significant numbers of primordial binaries , which segregate to the cluster core , equivalent energetic arguments ( goodman & hut 1989 ) lead to a similar scaling for the net rate at which binary encounters occur in the core .",
    "the above arguments apply to star clusters comprising identical point - mass stars . in a cluster with a range of stellar masses , three - body binaries generally form from stars which are more massive than average .",
    "after repeated exchange interactions , the binary will consist of two of the most massive stars in the cluster .",
    "conservation of linear momentum during encounters with lower mass stars means that the binary receives a smaller recoil velocity , making it less likely to be ejected from the cluster .",
    "the binary must therefore be considerably harder@xmath43before it is ejected following a encounter with another star ( see portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) .",
    "however , taking the finite sizes of real stars into account , it is quite likely that such a hard binary experiences a collision rather than being ejected .",
    "a strong encounter between a single star and a hard binary generally results in a resonant interaction .",
    "three stars remain in resonance until at least one of them escapes , or a collision reduces the three - body system to a stable binary . for harder binaries",
    "it becomes increasingly likely that a collision occurs instead of ejection ( mcmillan 1986 ) . in the calculations of portegies",
    "zwart et al . ( 1999 ) most binaries experience a collision at a binding energy of order @xmath44 , considerably smaller than the binding energy required for ejection .",
    "accordingly , we retain the above estimate of the binary formation rate ( eq . [ 3bb_rate ] ) and conclude that the collision rate per half - mass relaxation time is @xmath45 here we introduce @xmath46 , the effective fraction of dynamically formed binaries that produce a collision .",
    "note again that eq.[eq : ncoll_binary ] is valid only in the limit where stellar evolution is unimportant .",
    "the most massive star in the cluster is typically a member of the interacting binary and therefore dominates the collision rate .",
    "subsequent collisions cause the runaway to grow in mass , making it progressively less likely to escape from the cluster .",
    "the star which experiences the first collision is therefore likely to participate in subsequent collisions .",
    "the majority of collisions thus involve one particular object  the runaway merger  generally selected by its high initial mass and proximity to the cluster center ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for systems containing many primordial binaries the above argument must be modified . since dynamically formed binaries tend to be fairly soft ",
    "a few @xmath47we expect that the fraction of interactions with primordial binaries leading to collision is comparable to the value @xmath48 above . however , a critical difference is that , in systems containing many binaries , the collisions involve many different pairs of stars , not just the binary containing the massive runaway .",
    "for our proposed runaway scenario to operate , we must assume that high - mass binaries are rapidly destroyed or merge following interactions in the core , in which case the above arguments apply .",
    "we note that , once a runaway begins , binaries have large interaction cross sections and hence are likely to participate in the runaway process . from the point of view of producing massive merger products ,",
    "the worst - case scenario would be a substantial primordial population of wide high - mass binaries .",
    "we are currently carrying out n - body simulations to investigate the behavior of such systems .      once begun , the collision runaway dominates the collision cross section .",
    "the average mass increase per collision depends on the characteristics of the mass function in the cluster core",
    ". a lower limit for stars which participate in collisions can be derived from the degree of segregation in the cluster .",
    "inverting eq.[eq : tdf ] results in an estimate ( still assuming an isothermal sphere ) of the minimum mass of a star that can reach the cluster core in time @xmath49 due to dynamical friction : @xmath50 thus , at time @xmath49 and for a given mass @xmath33 , there is a maximum radius @xmath51 inside of which stars of mass @xmath33 will have segregated to the core .",
    "the stars contributing to the growth of the runaway are likely to be among those more massive than , because their number density in the core is enhanced by mass segregation , their collision cross sections are larger , and they contribute more to @xmath52 when they do collide .",
    "the shape of the central mass function of a segregated cluster is not trivial to derive . in thermal equilibrium , the central number densities of stars of different masses",
    "would be expected to scale as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the global ( scalo ) initial mass function , which scales roughly as @xmath55 at the high - mass end ( @xmath56 ) . however , as discussed in  3 , the distribution of secondary masses ( i.e.  the masses of the lighter stars participating in collisions ) does not follow the above simple relation . rather , we find that stars in the core do not reach thermal equilibrium ( a result generally consistent with earlier findings by chernoff and weinberg 1990 and joshi , nave & rasio 2001 ) , and that the dynamical nature of the collisional processes involved mean that more massive stars tend to be consumed before lower - mass stars arrive in the core .",
    "in addition , most collisions involve three - body binary formation and binary interactions in a multi - mass environment , further complicating the connection between stellar densities and secondary masses .    empirically , we find that the secondary mass distribution is quite well fit by a power - law , @xmath57 ( coincidentally very close to a salpeter distribution ) . integrating this expression from a minimum mass of ( and ignoring the upper limit ) results in a mean mass increase per collision of @xmath58 we neglect stars with masses less than @xmath59 .",
    "substitution of eq.[eq : trlx ] into eq.[eq : mdf ] and eq.[eq : mcoll ] then results in a mass increase per collision of @xmath60 taken over the entire `` collisional '' lifetime of the core , it is perhaps not surprising that the net distribution of secondary masses tends to follow the overall distribution of high - mass stars .      with simple expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath52 now",
    "in hand , we return to the determination of the runaway growth rate ( eq .  [ eq : mrunaway ] ) .",
    "the evaporation of a star cluster which fills its jacobi surface in an external potential is driven by tidal stripping .",
    "portegies zwart et al ( 2001a ) have studied the evolution of young compact star clusters within @xmath62pc of the galactic center .",
    "their calculations employed direct integration , including the effects of both stellar and binary evolution and the ( static ) external influence of the galaxy , and made extensive use of the grape-4 ( makino et al .",
    "1997 ) special - purpose computer .",
    "they found that the mass of a typical model cluster decreased almost linearly with time : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the mass of the cluster at birth and is the cluster s disruption time .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",

    "substituting eqs.[eq : ncoll_binary ] and [ eq : dmcoll ] into eq.[eq : mrunaway ] , and defining @xmath67 to rewrite eq.[eq : mass ] in terms of the number of stars in the cluster , we find @xmath68 integrating from @xmath69 to @xmath70 results in @xmath71 \\ , .",

    ", we have performed an additional series of simulations with @xmath76 stars using the same software and hardware .",
    "further simulations of systems containing substantial numbers of primordial binaries are in progress , but are much more time consuming , due to the complexity of following binary and multiple encounters in a large-@xmath20 context .      in our isolated star clusters ( three calculations ) with @xmath77 identical single point masses distributed as a plummer model , core collapse occurs at @xmath78 .",
    "this result is consistent with earlier calculations of e.g. , cohn ( 1980 ) and makino ( 1996 ) . doubling the mass of 20% of the stars reduced the core collapse time to @xmath79 . making 20% of the stars",

    "core collapse in these models occurred at @xmath83 .",
    "the slightly later collapse compared to the models just described , containing @xmath77 identical point masses and a heavy component , may be attributable to the rather different mass function , as well as to stellar mass loss , which tends to delay core collapse .",

    "these clusters are prone to runaway growth and produce massive compact objects at their centers .",
    "upon arrival at the galactic center , the star cluster dissolves , depositing its central black hole there .",
    "black holes from in - spiraling star clusters may subsequently merge to form a supermassive black hole .",
    "ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have proposed that such a scenario might explain the presence of the central black hole in the milky way galaxy .",
    "if we simply assume that bulges and central supermassive black holes are formed from disrupted star clusters , this model predicts a relation between black hole and bulge masses in galaxies similar to the expression ( eq.[eq : mrunaway_ii ] ) connecting the mass of an imbh to that of its parent cluster .",
    "however , the ratio of stellar mass to black - hole mass might be expected to be smaller for galactic bulges than for star clusters , because not all star clusters produce a black hole and not all star clusters survive until the maximum black hole mass is reached .",
    "we would expect , however , that the general relation between the black hole mass and that of the bulge remains valid .",
    "figure[fig : bhmass ] shows the relation between the black hole mass and the bulge mass for several seyfert galaxies and quasars .",

    "the solid curve passes though two other black - hole mass estimates , for m82 and the globular cluster m15 .",
    "we note that the observed relation between bulge and black hole masses has a spread of two orders of magnitude .",
    "if this bold extrapolation really does reflect the formation process of bulges and central black holes , this spread could be interpreted as a variation in the efficiency of the runaway merger process . in that case , only about one in a hundred star clusters reaches the galactic center , where its black hole is deposited .",
    "the possible black hole in the globular cluster m15 may have been formed by a scenario different from the one described in this paper , as the cluster s initial relaxation time probably exceeded our upper limit of 25myr .",
    "the current half - mass relaxation time of m15 is about 2.5gyr ( harris 1996 ) , which is far more than our 100myr limit for forming a massive central object from a collision runaway .",
    "an alternative is provided by miller & hamilton ( 2001 ) , who describe the formation of massive ( @xmath22 ) black holes in star clusters with relatively long relaxation times . in their model",
    "the black hole grows very slowly over a hubble time via occasional collisions with other stars , in contrast to the model described here , in which the runaway grows much more rapidly , reaching a characteristic mass of about 0.1% of the total birth mass of the cluster within a few megayears .",
    "one possible way around m15 s long relaxation time may involve the cluster s rotation .",
    "gebhardt ( 2000 ; 2001 ; private communication ) has measured radial velocities of individual stars in the crowded central field , down to two arcsec of the cluster center .",
    "he finds that , both in the central part of the cluster ( @xmath173 ) and outside the half mass radius , the average rotation velocity is substantial ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "rotation is quickly lost in a cluster , so to explain a current rotation , m15 s initial rotation rate must probably have been even larger than observed today ( see einsel & spurzem 1999 ) .",
    "hachisu ( 1978 ; 1982 ) found , using gaseous cluster models , that an initially rotating cluster tends to evolve into a gravo - gyro catastrophe which drives the cluster into core collapse far more rapidly than would occur in a non - rotating system .",
    "if the gravo - gyro - driven core collapse occurred within 25myr , a collision runaway might have initiated the growth of an intermediate mass black hole in the core of m15 .",
    "we study the runaway growth of a single star in a dense star cluster using a combination of complementary approaches .",
    "our semi - analytic analysis is supported by detailed calculations in which the effects of stellar evolution , stellar dynamics , binary evolution and the perturbing effect of a background galactic potential are taken self - consistently into account .",
    "star clusters with initial half - mass relaxation times @xmath175myr experience a phase of runaway growth . in this phase",
    "a single seed star grows to a mass of about 0.1% of the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the first collision occurs at the moment the cluster core collapses .",
    "this happens at about 0.2 but no later than about 5myr ( the evolution time scale for a @xmath176 star ) .",
    "the star which experiences the first collision becomes the target for further collisions , initiating runaway growth . the growth phase is terminated by ( 1 ) the disruption of the cluster in the tidal field of the galaxy ( at @xmath177 ) or ( 2 ) the reversal of core collapse by mass loss from the evolving stellar population ( after about 25myr ) .",
    "a star cluster can survive for longer than @xmath178 if , for example , it did not initially fill its jacobi surface ( `` roche lobe '' ) in the galactic tidal field .",
    "( examples are ngc3603 and r136 , the dense star cluster in the 30 doradus region in the large magellanic cloud . )",
    "such clusters go though a phase of runaway stellar growth , but recover after stellar mass loss drives the re - expansion of the cluster core .",
    "> from an observational point of view , a tidally limited cluster experiences three very distinct evolutionary phases : a pre - collapse phase until 0.2 , a phase of deep core collapse ( from 0.2 to about 25myr ) , followed by an expansion phase eventually leading to the disruption of the cluster . during the expansion phase",
    "the cluster half - mass radius expands , causing the mean relaxation time to increase by a factor of 4 ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "a cluster in this final phase will be observable with a current relaxation time less than @xmath179myr .",
    "the clearest indication of its previous phase of core collapse and runaway growth would be the presence of a central compact object with a mass @xmath129% of the initial cluster mass .",
    "the cluster may also be relatively depleted in low - mass compact objects ( stellar mass black holes and neutron stars ) , as these are consumed during the runaway growth phase .",
    "star clusters with an initial relaxation time @xmath180myr do not experience a phase of runaway growth , as core collapse is prevented by mass loss from the most massive stars .",
    "these clusters may experience core collapse after @xmath181myr , when stellar evolution slows ( takahashi & portegies zwart 1999 ) .",
    "this later core collapse , however , does not lead to a phase of runaway growth . in such old clusters",
    "multiple collisions are still likely to be common and may lead to blue stragglers with a mass more than twice the turn - off mass .",
