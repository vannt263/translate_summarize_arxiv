    "in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 , a hard hypersphere ( i.e. @xmath0-dimensional sphere ) packing is an arrangement of hyperspheres in which no two hyperspheres overlap . the _ packing density _ or _ packing fraction _",
    "@xmath5 is the fraction of space in @xmath1 covered by the spheres , which for identical spheres of radius @xmath6 , the focus of the paper , is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number density and @xmath9 is the volume of a @xmath0-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath6 and @xmath10 is the gamma function .",
    "sphere packings are of importance in a variety of contexts in the physical and mathematical sciences .",
    "dense sphere packings have been used to model a variety of many - particle systems , including liquids @xcite , amorphous materials and glassy states of matter @xcite , granular media @xcite , suspensions and composites @xcite , and crystals @xcite .",
    "the densest sphere packings are intimately related to the ground states of matter @xcite and the optimal way of sending digital signals over noisy channels @xcite .",
    "finding the densest sphere packing in @xmath1 for @xmath11 is generally a notoriously difficult problem @xcite .",
    "kepler s conjecture , which states that there is no other three - dimensional arrangement of identical spheres with a density greater than that of face - centered cubic lattice , was only recently proved @xcite .",
    "the densest sphere packing problem in the case of congruent spheres has not been rigorously solved for @xmath12 @xcite , although for @xmath13 and @xmath14 the @xmath15 and leech lattices , respectively , are almost surely the optimal solutions @xcite .    understanding the high - dimensional behavior of disordered sphere packings is a fundamentally important problem , especially in light of the recent conjecture that the densest packings in sufficiently high dimensions may be disordered rather than ordered @xcite . indeed ,",
    "ref .   provides a putative exponential improvement on minkowski s lower bound on the maximal density @xmath16 among all bravais lattices @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the riemann zeta function . for large values of @xmath0 , the asymptotic behavior of the minkowski s lower bound is controlled by @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , any saturated packing density satisfies the following so - called `` greedy '' lower bound : @xmath20 a saturated packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter and density @xmath5 in @xmath1 has the property that each point in space lies within a unit distance from the center of some sphere .",
    "thus , a covering of the space is achieved if each center is encompassed by a sphere of unit radius and the density of this covering is @xmath21 which proves the lower bound ( [ greedy_bound ] ) .",
    "note that it has the same dominant exponential term as in inequality ( [ minkowski_bound ] ) .",
    "the packing density of @xmath19 can also be exactly achieved by _ ghost random sequential addition _",
    "packings @xcite , an unsaturated packing less dense than the standard random sequential addition ( rsa ) packing @xcite in some fixed dimension @xmath0 , implying that the latter will have a superior dimensional scaling .",
    "additionally , the effect of dimensionality on the behavior of equilibrium hard - sphere liquids @xcite and of maximally random jammed spheres @xcite have been investigated .",
    "sphere packings are linked to a variety of fundamental characteristics of point configurations in @xmath1 , including the _ covering radius _ @xmath22 and the _ quantizer error _ @xmath23 , which are related to properties of the underlying voronoi cells @xcite .",
    "the covering and quantizer problems have relevance in numerous applications , including wireless communication network layouts , the search of high - dimensional data parameter spaces , stereotactic radiation therapy , data compression , digital communications , meshing of space for numerical analysis , coding , and cryptography @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that both of these quantities can be extracted from the _ void exclusion probability _ @xmath24 , which is defined to be the probability of finding a randomly placed spherical cavity of radius @xmath6 empty of any points .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath24 is the expected fraction of space not covered by circumscribing spheres of radius @xmath6 centered at each point .",
    "thus , if @xmath24 is identically zero for @xmath25 for a point process , then there is a covering associated with the point process with covering radius @xmath22 . finally , for a point configuration with positions @xmath26 , a quantizer is a device that takes as an input a position @xmath27 in @xmath28 and outputs the nearest point @xmath29 of the configuration to @xmath27 .",
    "assuming @xmath27 is uniformly distributed , one can define a mean square error , called the _ scaled dimensionless quantizer error _ , which can be obtained from the void exclusion probability via the relation @xcite : @xmath30 it is noteworthy that the optimal covering and quantizer solutions are the ground states of many - body interactions derived from @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the rsa procedure , which is the focus of the present paper , is a time - dependent process to generate disordered hard - hypersphere packings in @xmath1 @xcite . starting with a large , empty region of @xmath1 of volume @xmath31",
    ", spheres are randomly and sequentially placed into the volume subject to a nonoverlap constraint : if a new sphere does not overlap with any existing spheres , it will be added to the configuration ; otherwise , the attempt is discarded .",
    "one can stop the addition process at any time @xmath32 , obtaining rsa configurations with various densities @xmath33 up to the maximal saturation density @xmath34 that occurs in the infinite - time limit .",
    "besides identical d - dimensional spheres , the rsa packing process has also been investigated for polydisperse spheres @xcite and other particle shapes , including squares @xcite , rectangles @xcite , ellipses @xcite , spheroids @xcite , superdisks @xcite , sphere dimers @xcite , and sphere polymers @xcite in @xmath1 , and for different shapes on lattices @xcite and fractals @xcite . the rsa packing process in the first three space dimensions has been widely used to model the structure of cement paste @xcite , ion implantation in semiconductors @xcite , protein adsorption @xcite , polymer oxidation @xcite , and particles in cell membranes @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional case , also known as the `` car - parking '' problem , has been solved analytically and its saturation density is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath36 , the saturation density of rsa spheres has only been estimated through numerical simulations .    in general",
    ", generating exactly saturated ( infinite - time limit ) rsa configurations in @xmath1 is particularly difficult because infinite computational time is not available .",
    "the long - time limit of rsa density behaves as @xcite : @xmath37 previous investigators have attempted to ascertain the saturation densities of rsa configurations by extrapolating the densities obtained at large , finite times using the asymptotic formula ( [ rsa_infinite_time_density ] ) @xcite .    in order to describe more efficient ways of generating nearly - saturated and fully - saturated rsa configurations",
    ", we first need to define two important concepts : the _ exclusion sphere _ and the _",
    "available space_. the _ exclusion sphere _ associated with a hard sphere of diameter @xmath38 ( equal to @xmath39 ) is the volume excluded to another hard sphere s center due to the impenetrability constraint , and thus an exclusion sphere of radius @xmath38 circumscribes a hard sphere .",
    "the _ available space _ is the space exterior to the union of the exclusion spheres of radius @xmath38 centered at each sphere in the packing .",
    "a more general notion of the available space is a fundamental ingredient in the formulation of a general canonical @xmath40-point distribution function @xcite .",
    "an efficient algorithm to generate nearly - saturated rsa configurations was introduced in ref .  .",
    "this procedure exploited an economical procedure to ascertain the available space ( as explained in the subsequent section ) .",
    "although a huge improvement in efficiency can be achieved , this and all other previous algorithms still require extrapolation of the density of nearly - saturated configurations to estimate the saturation limit .",
    "in this paper , we present an improvement of the algorithm described in ref .   in order to generate saturated ( i.e. , infinite - time limit ) rsa packings of identical spheres in a finite amount of computational time . using this algorithm ,",
    "we improve upon previous calculations of the saturation packing and covering densities , pair correlation function , structure factor , void exclusion probability , and quantizer error in dimensions 2 through 8 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] , we describe the improved algorithm ; in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present the packing and covering densities , pair correlation function , structure factor , void exclusion probability , and quantizer error of saturated rsa configurations ; and in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we conclude with some discussions of extending this method to generate saturated rsa packings of objects other than congruent spheres .",
    "reference introduced an efficient algorithm to generate nearly saturated rsa configurations of hard @xmath0-dimensional spheres .",
    "specifically , a hypercubic simulation box is divided into small hypercubic `` voxels '' with side lengths much smaller than the diameter of the spheres . at any instant of time",
    ", spheres are sequentially added to the simulation box whenever there is available space for that sphere .",
    "each voxel can be probed to determine whether it may contain any available space or not to add another sphere . by tracking all of the voxels that can contain some portion of the available space",
    ", one can make insertion attempts only inside these `` available voxels '' and save computational time .",
    "this enables one to achieve a huge improvement in computational efficiency over previous methods .",
    "however , this and all other previous algorithms still require extrapolation of the density of nearly - saturated configurations to estimate the saturation limit .",
    "sub - voxels .",
    "the available ones constitute a new voxel list .",
    "e : return to the third step with the new available voxel list and two additional disks are inserted .",
    "the program then subdivides each voxel into four subvoxels and all subvoxels can be identified as unavailable .",
    "thus the program finishes.,width=604 ]    the improved algorithm reported in the present paper differs from the original voxel method @xcite by dividing the undetermined voxels ( voxels that are not included in any exclusion sphere after certain amount of insertion trials ) into smaller subvoxels . repeating this voxel subdivision process with progressively greater resolution enables us to track the available space more and more precisely .",
    "eventually , this allows us to discover _ all _ of the available space at any point in time and completely consume it in order to arrive at saturated configurations .",
    "the improved algorithm consists of the following steps , which are illustrated in figure  [ process ] :    1 .",
    "starting from an empty simulation box in @xmath28 , the cartesian coordinates of a sphere of radius @xmath6 are randomly generated .",
    "this sphere is added if it does not overlap with any existing sphere in the packing at that point in time ; otherwise , the attempt is discarded .",
    "this addition process is repeated until the success rate is sufficiently low @xcite .",
    "the acceptance ratio of this step equals to the volume fraction of the available space inside the simulation box : + @xmath41 + where @xmath42 is the acceptance ratio of this step , @xmath43 is the volume fraction of the available space , @xmath44 is the volume of the available space and @xmath45 is the volume of the simulation box with side length @xmath46 .",
    "when the fraction of the available space is low , we improve the acceptance ratio by avoiding insertion attempts in the unavailable space . to do this ,",
    "the simulation box is divided into hypercubic voxels , with side lengths comparable to the sphere radius .",
    "each voxel is probed to determine whether it is completely included in any of the exclusion spheres or not . if not",
    ", the voxel is added to the available voxel list .",
    "thus we obtain an `` available voxel list '' .",
    "a voxel in this list may or may not contain available space , but the voxels not included in this list are guaranteed to contain no available space .",
    "3 .   since some unavailable space is excluded from the voxel list , we can achieve a higher success rate of insertion by selecting a voxel randomly from the available voxel list , generate a random point inside it , attempt to insert a sphere and repeat this step .",
    "the acceptance ratio of this step is equal to the volume fraction of the available space inside voxels from the available voxel list : + @xmath47 + where @xmath42 is the acceptance ratio of this step , @xmath43 is the volume fraction of the available space inside the voxel list , @xmath44 is the volume of the available space , @xmath48 is the number of voxels in the available voxel list and @xmath49 is the volume of a voxel .",
    "4 .   in the previous step",
    ", spheres were inserted into the system , thus the volume of the available space will decrease . eventually , @xmath44 is very low and @xmath42 is also low .",
    "thus we improve the efficiency again by dividing each voxel in the voxel list into @xmath50 sub - voxels , each with side length equal to a half of that of the original voxel .",
    "each sub - voxel is checked for availability according to the rule described in step 2 .",
    "the available ones constitute the new voxel list .",
    "return to step 3 with the new voxel list and repeat steps 3 to 5 until the number of voxels in the latest voxel list is zero .",
    "since we only exclude a voxel from the voxel list when we are absolutely sure that it does not contain any available space , we know at this stage that the entire simulation box does not contain any available space and thus the configuration is saturated .",
    "we have used the method described in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] to generate saturated configurations of rsa packings of hyperspheres in dimensions two through eight in a hypercubic ( @xmath0-dimensional cubic ) box of side length @xmath46 under periodic boundary conditions . in each dimension ,",
    "multiple sphere sizes are chosen .",
    "the relative sphere volume is represented by the ratio of a sphere s volume to the simulation box s volume @xmath51 , where @xmath6 is the sphere radius and @xmath45 is the volume of the hypercubic simulation box . for each sphere size ,",
    "multiple configurations are generated .",
    "the number of spheres @xmath52 contained in these configurations fluctuate around some average value inversely proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "the relative sphere volume @xmath51 and number of configurations @xmath53 generated for each sphere radius @xmath6 in each dimension is given in table  [ nbrconfig ] .",
    "the mean density and its standard error for each sphere radius @xmath6 is calculated .",
    "subsequently , we plot the mean density @xmath54 and its standard error @xmath55 versus a quantity proportional to @xmath56 , namely @xmath57^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we then perform a weighted linear least squares fit @xcite to this function in each dimension in order to extrapolate to the infinite - system - size [ @xmath58 limit .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ quantizer_error ]",
    "we have devised an efficient algorithm to generate exactly saturated , infinite - time limit rsa configurations in finite computational time across euclidean space dimensions . with the algorithm ,",
    "we have improved previous results of the saturation density and extended them to a wider range of dimensions , i.e. , up through dimension eight .",
    "the associated covering density , pair correlation function , structure factor , void exclusion probability , and quantizer error have also been improved . in particular , we found appreciable improvement for @xmath3 near contact and @xmath4 in the @xmath61 limit , which are especially sensitive to whether or not very small fragments of the available space are truly eliminated as the saturation state is approached .",
    "we observed that as @xmath0 increases , the degree of  hyperuniformity \" ( the magnitude of the suppression of infinite - wavelength density fluctuations ) increases and appears to be consistent with @xmath62 our results also supports the `` decorrelation principle '' , which in turns lends further credence to a conjectural lower bound on the maximal sphere packing density that provides the putative exponential improvement on minkowski s lower bound @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the rsa packing in @xmath1 has relevance in the study of high - dimensional scaling of packing densities .",
    "for example , ref .   suggested that since rsa packing densities appear to have a similar scaling in high dimensions as the best lower bound on bravais lattice packings densities , the density of disordered packings might eventually surpass that of the densest lattice packing beyond some large but finite dimension .",
    "our improvements to the saturation densities , as well as a previous investigation @xcite , support this conjecture . converting a packing into a covering by replacing each sphere with its exclusion sphere",
    "is rigorous only if the packing is exactly saturated . by guaranteeing that the packings that we generated are saturated , we rigorously met this condition ( in a large finite simulation box ) .",
    "although the best known lattice covering and lattice quantizer perform better than their rsa counterparts in low dimensions , rsa packings may outperform lattices in sufficiently high dimensions , as suggested in ref .  .",
    "it is useful here to comment on the ability to ascertain the high - dimensional scaling of rsa packing densities from low - dimensional data @xcite .",
    "we have fitted our data of the saturation densities as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath2 using a variety of different functions .",
    "the best fit we find is the following form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are parameters .",
    "however , it is not clear how accurate this form is for @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , this form is likely not correct in high dimensions , where it has been suggested from theoretical considerations @xcite that high - dimensional scaling may be given by the asymptotic form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are constants .",
    "it is noteworthy that ( [ fit1 ] ) provides a fit that is very nearly as good as ( [ fit2 ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , for @xmath72 , the estimates of the saturation densities obtained from ( [ fit2 ] ) and ( [ fit1 ] ) differ by about 20% , which is a substantial discrepancy and indicates the uncertainties involved in applying such dimensional scalings for even moderately - sized dimensions .",
    "when @xmath0 is very large , extrapolations based on fits of low - dimensional data is even more problematic . in this limit , eq .",
    "( [ fit2 ] ) is dominated by the @xmath73 term , which can be significantly larger than the @xmath74 dominating term in eq .",
    "( [ fit1 ] ) , although it is safe to say that the saturation density grows at least as fast as @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , caution should be exercised in attempting to ascertain the precise high-@xmath0 asymptotic behavior of rsa saturation densities from our data in relatively low dimensions .",
    "the same level of caution should be employed in attempting to determine high-@xmath0 scaling behavior by extrapolating low - dimensional packing densities for other types of sphere packings .",
    "for example , it may useful to revisit the high - dimensional scalings that have been ascertained or tested for the maximally random jammed densities @xcite . in summary , it is nontrivial to ascertain high-@xmath0 scalings of packing densities from low - dimensional information .",
    "in contrast , in the study of the dimensional dependence of continuum percolation thresholds , it is possible to obtain exact high-@xmath0 asymptotics and tight upper and lower bounds that apply across all dimensions @xcite .",
    "rsa packings of spheres with a polydispersity in size have also been investigated previously @xcite .",
    "our algorithm can easily be extended to generate saturated rsa packings of polydisperse spheres in @xmath28 by constructing a @xmath76-dimensional auxiliary space for the associated radius - dependent available space and voxels , where the additional dimension is used to represent the radius of a sphere that could be added in the rsa process .",
    "rsa packings of nonspherical particles have also been studied , including squares @xcite , rectangles @xcite , ellipses @xcite , spheroids @xcite , and superdisks @xcite . while packings of polyhedra have received recent attention @xcite , rsa packings of such shapes have not been considered to our knowledge .",
    "our algorithm can also be extended to treat these situations by constructing auxiliary spaces for the associated orientation - dependent available space and voxels .",
    "the dimension of such an auxiliary space is determined by the total number of degrees of freedom associated with a particle , i.e. , translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the extensions of the methods devised here to generate saturated packings of polydisperse spheres and nonspherical particles is an interesting direction for future research .",
