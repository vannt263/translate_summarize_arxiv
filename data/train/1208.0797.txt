    "the discovery of the expansion of the universe and the concept of a singularity from which the universe emerged ( big bang ) has an interesting history @xcite . in this introduction",
    ", we provide a brief review of the early development of modern cosmology , describing very elementary ( yet fundamental ) cosmological models that will play an important role in our study .    in 1917 , einstein @xcite applied the equations of general relativity to cosmology , assuming that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic . on the ground of cultural and philosophical beliefs , he considered a static universe . in order to accommodate for such a solution , he had to introduce a cosmological constant @xmath26 in the equations of general relativity , so as to obtain a static solution @xmath27 . in einstein",
    "s belief , the newtonian effect of the cosmological constant was to shield the gravitational interaction on a distance @xmath28 .",
    "this is actually incorrect .",
    "lematre @xcite was the first to understand that the cosmological constant can be interpreted as a force of `` cosmic repulsion '' . in the newtonian context , the modified poisson equation including the cosmological constant is @xmath29 , leading to the static solution @xmath30 . ] .",
    "he obtained a model of the universe with a positive curvature @xmath31 that is finite ( yet unbounded ) with a `` radius '' @xmath32 , a density @xmath33 , and a mass @xmath34 .",
    "the same year , de sitter @xcite discovered another static solution of the einstein equations ( according to the review of robertson @xcite , this solution was suggested to de sitter by ehrenfest ) .",
    "this universe is empty ( @xmath35 ) and has a radius @xmath36 . in this model ,",
    "the stars and nebulae are just `` test particles '' that do not curve the universe .",
    "de sitter managed to predict that the light emitted by these sources should be redshifted because ( i ) they move away from the observer due to the effect of the cosmological constant , and ( ii ) there is a slowing down of time with increasing distance from the observer ( de sitter effect ) .",
    "he mentioned that some observations ( presumably those made by slipher since 1912 ) seem to confirm that claim .",
    "he also predicted a linear , or quadratic , relationship between the redshift and the distance .",
    "however , his interpretation of the redshifts remained enigmatic for a long time .",
    "therefore , the early cosmological debate revolved around two deficient models : the model of einstein which was unable to explain redshifts , and the model of de sitter which contained no matter and was rather mysterious .",
    "both were built on the assumption that the universe is static .    in 1922 and 1924 , friedmann @xcite discovered non - static cosmological solutions of the einstein equations describing the temporal variation of space .",
    "he considered the case of spherical ( positive curvature @xmath31 ) and hyperbolic ( negative curvature @xmath37 ) universes .",
    "he described expanding and contracting solutions , as well as cyclic solutions , and foresaw the possible beginning of the universe in a singularity .",
    "he obtained for the first time an estimate of the age of the universe of the order of @xmath38 billion years . at that time",
    ", einstein did not believe in the significance of these non stationary solutions .",
    "he first argued that the friedmann solutions were not compatible with the field equations of general relativity @xcite , then retracted his statement @xcite but remained convinced that the friedmann solutions are not physically relevant @xcite .",
    "apart from einstein , who criticized them , the papers of friedmann remained unnoticed by the physical community until 1930 .    in 1922 ,",
    "lanczos @xcite found a non - stationary form of de sitter s solution in which the scale factor increases exponentially rapidly .",
    "he had the key to an expanding universe but did not recognize its physical significance . in 1923 , weyl @xcite published a paper in which he tried to find his own way to de sitter s redshift .",
    "he noted that the particles in de sitter s universe move away from each other with a velocity proportional to their distance , but did not provide an explicit system of coordinates to make his claim more precise . in 1925",
    ", lematre @xcite found a system of coordinates in which de sitter s model is non - static and leads to a linear relationship between the velocity ( redshift ) and the distance .",
    "this model explains the redshifts of distant objects in an unambiguous way .",
    "this model is euclidean @xmath39 ( which was problematic for lematre ) and the scale factor increases exponentially rapidly with time due to the cosmological constant .    in 1927 , lematre @xcite rediscovered independently from friedmann the non - stationary cosmological solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "in addition , having spent two years in harvard and at the mit , he was aware of cosmological observations and related the expansion of space predicted by the theory of general relativity to the recession motion of galaxies observed by slipher , hubble and strmberg .",
    "he interpreted the redshift of the nebulae as a consequence of the expansion of the universe , predicted a linear relationship between the recession velocity and the distance ( the nowdays called `` hubble relationship '' ) and , using available data @xcite , obtained an estimate of the `` hubble constant '' @xmath40 two years before hubble @xcite .",
    "the work of lematre , like the one of his predecessor friedmann , was still not appreciated by einstein who found it `` abominable '' @xcite .    in 1928 and 1929 , robertson @xcite reinterpreted de sitter s solution dynamically .",
    "however , like lanczos @xcite and weyl @xcite , he did not `` see '' the expanding universe .    in 1930 ,",
    "eddington , who was working with mcvittie on possible dynamical solutions of the cosmological einstein equations ( following a discussion that he had with de sitter during a meeting of the royal astronomical society @xcite ) , was alerted by lematre about his own results .",
    "he publicized them in a paper @xcite in which he showed that the einstein static universe is unstable ( a result that was implicit in the paper of lematre ) .",
    "he also emphasized a non - singular solution of lematre in which the universe starts from the static solution of einstein for @xmath41 , then expands ( this model is often called the eddington - lematre model ) . in parallel , de sitter advertised lematre s discovery of an expanding universe in several publications @xcite .",
    "together with the supporting observations of hubble @xcite , and independent theoretical work by robertson @xcite , this really meant the demise of the static universe .    in 1931 ,",
    "einstein was forced to admit the theoretical and observational reality of the expansion of the universe .",
    "he took an extreme position and renounced to the cosmological constant @xcite that he considered being the `` biggest blunder '' of his life ( in contrast , lematre @xcite always defended the cosmological constant as one of the most fundamental ingredients of modern cosmology ) . in 1932 , einstein published with de sitter a one - page paper @xcite in which they consider an expanding universe in a euclidean space ( zero curvature @xmath39 ) without pressure ( @xmath42 ) and without cosmological constant ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is the celebrated einstein - de sitter ( eds ) solution that describes the matter era .",
    "the main motivation of these authors was to show that an expansion of the universe is possible even without the cosmological constant .    in the meantime",
    ", lematre had gone one step further .",
    "if the universe is expanding , it may have started from a _ singularity _ in the past . in 1931 , he proposed a model @xcite in which the universe begins its expansion from a singular initial state , or more precisely , from a near - singularity that he called the `` primeval atom '' @xcite .",
    "this expansion is followed by a phase of stagnation during which the universe remains close to the static einstein solution . in lematre s model , it is during this phase of stagnation that galaxies form . at later times",
    ", the universe enters in the de sitter phase of exponential expansion .",
    "a new controversy started with einstein who did not believe in the singular model of lematre that implies that the universe has a `` beginning '' .",
    "this controversy remained until the end of their life . on the other hand , in 1960 , fred hoyle , who promoted a `` steady state theory '' @xcite in which the universe has always been identical to itself and in which matter is created spontaneously , and continuously , made fun of lematre during a meeting in pasadena by introducing him as the `` big bang man '' @xcite .",
    "this is how the term `` big bang '' was introduced in cosmology and became popular .    up to the mid-1960 s , it was not clear whether the early universe had been hot or cold .",
    "the discovery by penzias and wilson @xcite of the @xmath44 cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , whose existence had been predicted by the hot universe theory @xcite , immediately led widespread acceptance to the big bang theory . according to that theory , the early universe was filled with an ultrarelativistic gas of photons , electrons , positrons , quarks , antiquarks , etc .",
    "this is described by an equation of state @xmath45 from which it is easily deduced that the scale factor evolves as @xmath46 , the density as @xmath47 , and the temperature as @xmath48 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the scale factor vanishes while the energy density and the temperature become infinite .",
    "this is why the point @xmath20 is known as the point of the initial cosmological singularity ( big bang ) .",
    "as the universe expands , the density and the temperature decrease .",
    "when the universe is sufficiently cooled , particles and antiparticles annihilate each other , the photon - gas energy density falls off relatively rapidly and the main contribution of the matter density starts to come from the small excess of baryons over antibaryons , as well as from other fields and particles which now comprise the dark matter .",
    "however , the hot universe theory suffers from a series of difficulties .",
    "the first difficulty is the singularity problem .",
    "the energy density goes to @xmath49 at @xmath20 and the solution can not be formally continued for @xmath12 .",
    "a natural question is : `` what was before @xmath20 ? '' .",
    "of course , one can argue that space and time started with the big bang , so that this question is meaningless .",
    "however , this answer is not quite satisfactory . on the other hand , close to the big bang",
    ", the density can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this is in conflict with the laws of physics .",
    "when the density becomes high enough , quantum effects should be taken into account in the problem . as a result , the planck density @xmath50 , the planck length @xmath51 , the planck mass @xmath52 , the planck temperature @xmath53 , and the planck time @xmath54 should play a fundamental role in the very early universe .",
    "the standard big bang theory suffers from other problems that are known as the flatness problem ( or the fine - tuning problem ) , the horizon problem ( or the causality problem ) , and the monopole problem .",
    "these problems can be solved at one stroke in the framework of inflationary cosmology @xcite . in that scenario ,",
    "the universe was in an unstable vacuum - like state described by some hypothetical scalar field @xmath55 with its origin in quantum fluctuations .",
    "this leads to an equation of state @xmath56 , implying a constant energy density @xmath57 , of the order of the planck density @xmath58 , called the vacuum energy . as a result of this vacuum energy ,",
    "the universe expands exponentially rapidly in a tiniest fraction of a second .",
    "this `` inflation '' can solve the above - mentioned problems . at the same time , the inflation theory predicts the scale invariant spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations and explains why the universe is spatially flat ( or behaves _ as if _ it were spatially flat due to the smallness of @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is therefore a very attractive theory .    in this paper , we propose a model of the early universe based on a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath10 . before that",
    ", we first explain how we came to such a description .    in previous works @xcite",
    ", we explored the possibility that the universe is filled with self - gravitating bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) with short - range interactions ( see a detailed list of references in @xcite and recent additional references in @xcite ) . in the strong coupling limit ( the so - called thomas - fermi approximation ) , the equation of state of the bec is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the scattering length @xcite .",
    "this is the equation of state of a polytrope with index @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "initially , this model was introduced in order to describe dark matter halos .",
    "a nice feature of the bec model is that it avoids the presence of cusps at the center of the halos because of the effective repulsion due to the heisenberg principle or because of the self - interaction of the bosons which plays the same role as the pauli exclusion principle for fermions .",
    "since cusps are not observed in real dark matter halos , the bec model ( or the fermion model ) is favored as compared to the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model that predicts cuspy density profiles .",
    "of course , at large scales , these models become equivalent .",
    "the bec model was then applied to cosmology in order to describe the evolution of the universe as a whole @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we investigated the evolution of a `` bec universe '' with an equation of state of the form @xmath62 .",
    "we considered the case of repulsive ( @xmath7 ) and attractive ( @xmath8 ) self - interaction .",
    "more generally , we studied a `` cosmic fluid '' described by an equation of state of the form @xmath63 . when @xmath39 , we recover the standard linear equation of state @xmath64 describing radiation ( @xmath2 ) , pressureless matter ( @xmath3 ) , stiff matter ( @xmath4 ) , and vacuum energy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , the generalized equation of state @xmath65 can be viewed as the sum of a linear term describing a `` classical '' universe and a quadratic term due to the bec . at late times , when the density is low , the effect of the bec is negligible and we recover the classical universe . on the contrary ,",
    "the effect of the bec becomes important in the early universe where the density is high .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study how the bec affects the early evolution of the universe . in our previous paper @xcite , we assumed that becs form after the radiation era , when the temperature has sufficiently decreased .",
    "this prevented us from extrapolating the solution before the radiation era ( see the remark in sec .",
    "8.2 of @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that the equation of state @xmath62 may hold _ before _ the radiation era .",
    "therefore , we assume that the early universe is described by an equation of state of the form @xmath63 with @xmath2 . actually , the study of this generalized equation of state is interesting even if its origin is not connected to becs .",
    "furthermore , for this class of models , the friedmann equations can be solved analytically , which is an additional source of motivation .",
    "first results were given in @xcite where it was shown that the repulsive and attractive models behave very differently .",
    "for repulsive self - interactions ( @xmath7 ) , the universe starts at @xmath20 from a singularity at which the density is infinite but the radius finite .",
    "for attractive self - interactions ( @xmath8 ) , the universe always existed in the past . for @xmath41",
    ", its density tends to a constant value while its radius tends to zero exponentially rapidly .    in the present paper",
    ", we complete the study of the generalized equation of state @xmath63 .",
    "first , we analyze its thermodynamical properties and study the temporal evolution of the temperature . secondly , for @xmath8",
    ", we show that the exponential growth of the scale factor can account for a phase of inflation with constant density that we identify with the planck density @xmath58 . finally ,",
    "taking @xmath2 , we study the transition between a pre - radiation era and the radiation era .",
    "we mention the analogy with a second order phase transition where the control parameter is the time @xmath66 , the order parameter is the scale factor @xmath67 , and the planck constant @xmath24 plays the role of finite size effects ( the standard big bang theory is recovered for @xmath25 ) . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the radius of the universe passes from @xmath68 at @xmath69 to @xmath15 at @xmath70 before entering in the radiation era and increasing algebraically as @xmath71 . during the inflationary phase",
    ", the density remains approximately constant with the planck value ( @xmath72 ) before decreasing as @xmath73 .",
    "the temperature passes from @xmath74 at @xmath69 to @xmath75 at @xmath76 before decreasing algebraically as @xmath77 .",
    "it achieves its maximum value @xmath78 at @xmath79 . for @xmath8 , the initial radius of the universe @xmath80",
    "is already `` large '' so there is no inflation .",
    "the velocity of sound is less than the speed of light only for @xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "this marks the beginning of the physical universe in this model .",

    "in most parts of this paper ( except in sec . [ sec_fm ] ) , we shall take @xmath43 .",
    "this is because we are interested in the very early universe in which the pressure of radiation dominates over the dark energy ( cosmological constant ) . on the other hand",
    ", we consider a flat universe ( @xmath39 ) in agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "then , the friedmann equations reduce to @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115    the friedmann equations can also be derived in the context of newtonian cosmology . in this framework ,",

    "finally , the continuity equation was corrected in a recent paper by lima _",
    "actually , the derivation of the friedmann equations with relativistic effects ( pressure ) from newtonian cosmology was first exposed by lematre @xcite as early as 1931 ( see also @xcite ) . however , for lematre , the newtonian derivation of the cosmological equations is just a pedagogical means and does not reflect the true ( relativistic ) nature of the problem . in modern textbooks of astrophysics @xcite , newtonian cosmology with pressure",
