    "the last update of the atlas and cms collaborations on the higgs searches established the existence of a new resonance at 125 gev with @xmath9 significance for the signal  @xcite .",
    "this resonance is compatible with the higgs boson , that would complete the standard model ( sm ) picture .",
    "however , to be sure that this new resonance is the sm higgs boson , one need , among other things , measure its couplings and compare them to their sm prediction . in case of inconsistencies",
    ", one should try to identify the information that can be drawn on new physics from the higgs data .",
    "several studies have been performed on monte - carlo expectations  @xcite as well as on the first hints from 2011 data  @xcite . in the light of the new higgs data several new studies",
    "have already appeared where general higgs couplings are probed  @xcite .",
    "these studies use a model independent approach by adding a small , independent , deviation to each of the higgs couplings to the sm particles .",
    "however , one needs to interpret these deviations in terms of possible new physics models . with that goal , we study in this paper the implication of a set of effective operators on the higgs data , see refs .",
    "@xcite for earlier works , and interpret them with respect to their possible ultraviolet completions . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , correlations between the coefficient of the effective operators arise when considering these new physics models , which offer the possibility to test these models via the measurement of the higgs couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing how the higgs couplings and observables are modified by the presence of effective operators .",
    "we then apply the recent constraints obtained at the lhc to the coefficient of the effective operators and show how they can be used to discriminate between different new physics model .",
    "finally we propose new ways to improve the measurement of the effective coefficients considered in this work .",
    "effective operators are useful to describe beyond the sm ( bsm ) physics in the low - energy limit in a model - independent way , similar to fermi s theory for beta decay .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is suppressed by the scale of new physics @xmath12 and the mass dimension @xmath13 of the operator . while the lowest dimensional operator , the unique @xmath14 weinberg operator , violates lepton number and leads to majorana neutrino masses",
    ", there is a phletora of @xmath0 operators which can be constructed from sm fields  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the number of independent operators ) . among these operators ,",
    "only a few can be built from the higgs and sm gauge fields only , which can be directly related to observables in the higgs sector .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we focus on the ones which can be mediated at tree level ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , assuming that these may be the leading ones in perturbative theories . in the buchmller - wyler basis  @xcite , they read @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the higgs doublet .",
    "as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 can only be tested by measuring the higgs self - couplings  @xcite ( or new interactions , such as higher order interactions of the higgs ) .",
    "since this may be difficult at the lhc , we disregard it for the moment and comment on it later . in addition , @xmath18 is severely constrained by electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) , in particular , the contribution to the t  parameter , which leads to @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , any completion of the theory must not violate this bound , which restricts the possible mediators leading to the effective operators @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .    in order to describe the modification of the sm lagrangian by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "all sm relationships are expressed in terms of the best measured quantities , the fermi constant @xmath22 , the fine - structure constant @xmath23 , the mass of the @xmath24 boson @xmath25 , and the mass of the higgs boson @xmath26 , which is accessible at the lhc , and renormalizing the lagrangian by keeping these fixed to their measured values .",
    "this procedure is in detail discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and leads ( among other implications ) to the following leading order modifications of the sm higgs - gauge boson and higgs - fermion couplings : @xmath27 here @xmath28 represents the sm gauge bosons @xmath29 and @xmath24 . because of these modifications , the couplings of the higgs boson to two gluons , mediated by a fermion loop , is also modified and goes like @xmath30 while the coupling to two photons reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33\\tau^{-2}$ ] , @xmath34\\tau^{-2}$ ] and @xmath35 & \\tau>1\\end{array}\\right.\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the comparison with the literature , we also use the deviations from the sm couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the following . as a consequence",

    "focusing on su(2 ) singlet , doublet , and triplet scalars , and singlet and triplet vectors as the mediation fields of the effective operators , all possibilities for the tree - level mediation of these operators have been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite . the procedure can be qualitatively described as follows : all possible topologies and fields insertions , which can lead to the effective operators , have been identified , together with the minimum set of necessary interactions to generate the operators ( plus interactions among the mediators ) .",
    "then the fields have been simultaneously integrated out to derive the operator coefficients and possible effects of new mediator - mediator couplings in the multi - mediator cases . from this minimum set of interactions ,",

    "the different dominant higgs production mode ( compared to @xmath82 ) leads to a different dependence on the effective operator coefficients .",
    "it is , at the end , a matter of statistics where the best information can be obtained . from the higgs production cross sections at @xmath95 , which is suppressed for vector boson fusion",
    "compared to gluon fusion by about one order of magnitude , these options should be comparable in terms of statistics , but it is not clear how this comparison looks like in the presence of selection efficiencies , backgrounds , and energy resolution . in principle , @xmath91 is the channel from which the strongest constraints are expected , since the dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] is stronger , which means that it is worth to optimize it . in terms of theory",
    ", both channels will lead to strong constraints of the couplings in table  [ tab : combin ] , and may finally rule out the sm prediction .",

    "if @xmath70 can be measured from the higgs - fermion couplings , then @xmath99 can be in principle extracted from measuring this coupling . however , note that also new higher order effective higgs interactions are generated by @xmath17 : @xmath100 these are not present in the sm and may be useful in the future to discover new physics and interpret it in terms of bsm theories",
    ". however , there will be also an irreducible sm background from the production of several higgses by sm interactions , and it remains to be seen if useful information can be obtained from these couplings .",
    "in addition , the measurement of these couplings requires beyond lhc technology , such as a linear or muon collider .",
    "the discovery of the higgs at the lhc is the beginning of a new era which can be regarded as the precision physics of the higgs sector .",
    "especially the new data allow to probe the values of the higgs - gauge boson and higgs - fermion couplings .",
    "we have focused on the theoretical interpretation of possible deviations from the standard model identified there , where we have used a model - independent approach .",
    "we have tested the hypothesis that new physics may lead to effective @xmath0 operators made from higgs and gauge bosons only , and that the new mediators lead to a tree level generation of such an operator .",
    "two of the operators can be directly related to a linear combination of the higgs - gauge boson and higgs - fermion couplings , which are perhaps the simplest observables in the higgs sector .",
    "we have demonstrated how current bounds translate into the measurement of the effective operator coefficients . with the data from the leading channels ,",
    "an approximate degeneracy between the coefficients has been identified .",
    "future measurements of sub - leading channels , such as the inclusive @xmath1 channel and the exclusive vector boson fusion - dominated @xmath2 channel , can be used to reduce that and to exclude the sm case .",
    "we have also demonstrated how the measurements can be interpreted in terms of the tree level mediators , which lead to particular correlations in the effective operator plane .",
    "although the actual low statistics does not allow one to draw definitive conclusions , we have shown that the lhc is powerful enough to constrain the effective operators that modify the higgs sector .",
    "current data do not allow for a simple interpretation of the possible deviation from the standard model in terms of a single mediator .",
    "we have illustrated that a beyond the standard model interpretation of the current deviation requires several new fields with particular relationships among the couplings , which does not seem appealing .",
    "finally , additional information on possible new physics in the higgs sector can be obtained from measuring the higgs self - couplings , which is known to be challenging . as an alternative , higher order",
    "effective higgs couplings can be used to measure the remaining effective operator , which may be indicative for a new scalar doublet coupling to the higgs sector only .",
    "although these may be more difficult to measure , this possibility should be studied in the future .",

    "<S> we demonstrate how the measurements of the higgs - fermion and higgs - gauge boson couplings can be interpreted in terms of physics beyond the standard model in a model - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we describe deviations from the standard model by effective @xmath0 operators made of higgs fields and gauge fields , under the hypothesis that the new physics may show up in the higgs sector only and the effective operators are generated at tree level . while the effective operator coefficients are independent in general , the completion of the theory at high energies will lead to specific correlations which will be recovered between higgs - fermion and higgs - gauge boson couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the current measurement of these couplings in terms of tree - level new physics requires several new mediators with specific relationships among different couplings . </S>",
    "<S> new insights in the effective theory and mediator spaces can be expected for improved measurements from the inclusive @xmath1 and the exclusive vector boson fusion - dominated @xmath2 search channels , as well as the measurement of the higgs self - couplings , including higher order couplings which do not exist in the standard model .    </S>",
