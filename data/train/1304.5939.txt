    "it may be helpful to consider an alternative description of the permutation distribution given in ( [ equationnewperm ] ) . as a shorthand , for any @xmath25 , let @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote a random permutation , uniformly distributed over @xmath20 .",
    "then , @xmath50 denotes the random variable that evaluates the test statistic , not at the original data @xmath51 , but at a randomly permuted data set @xmath52 .",
    "the permutation distribution @xmath53 given in ( [ equationnewperm ] ) is evidently the conditional distribution of @xmath54 given @xmath51 , because conditional on the data @xmath51 , @xmath55 is equally likely to be any of @xmath56 among @xmath25 . the asymptotic behavior of this ( conditional ) distribution @xmath57 is the key to establishing properties of the permutation test .",
    "although the rejection probability of the permutation test is exactly @xmath4 when , problems arise if @xmath58 is strictly bigger than @xmath59 . since a transformed permuted data set no longer has the same distribution as the original data set , the argument leading to the construction of an @xmath4 level test fails , and faulty inferences can occur .    to be concrete , if we are interested in testing equality of means , for example , then @xmath60 which , of course , is strictly bigger than @xmath59 .",
    "so , consider constructing a permutation test based on the difference of sample means @xmath61 note that we are not taking the absolute difference , so that the test is one - sided , as we are rejecting for large positive values of the difference . first of all , we are not concerned about testing @xmath62 , but something bigger than @xmath59",
    ". however , we underscore the point that a test statistic ( [ equationtmn ] ) is not appropriate for testing @xmath59 without further assumptions because the test clearly will not have any power against distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 whose means are identical but @xmath63 .",
    "the permutation test based on the difference of sample means is only appropriate as a test of equality of population means .",
    "however , the permutation test no longer controls the level of the test , even in large samples .",
    "as is well known ( romano @xcite ) , the permutation test possesses a certain asymptotic robustness as a test of difference in means if @xmath64 as @xmath65 , or the underlying variances of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equal , in the sense that the rejection probability under the null hypothesis of equal means tends to the nominal level . without equal variances or comparable sample sizes , the rejection probability can be much larger than the nominal level , which is a concern .",
    "because of the lack of robustness and the increased probability of a type 1 error , rejection of the null may incorrectly be interpreted as rejection of equal means , when in fact it is caused by unequal variances and unequal sample sizes .",
    "even more alarming is the possibility of rejecting a two - sided null hypothesis when observing a positive large difference with the accompanying inference that mean difference is positive when in fact the difference in means is negative , a  type 3 error or directional error . indeed ,",
    "if for some @xmath0 and @xmath1 with equal means the rejection probability is , say , @xmath66 , then it follows by continuity that the rejection probability under some @xmath0 and @xmath1 with negative mean difference will be nearly @xmath67 as well , where one would conclude that the mean difference is actually positive . further note",
    "that there is also the possibility that the rejection probability can be much less than the nominal level , which by continuity implies the test is biased and has little power of detecting a true difference in means , or large type 2 error .",
    "the situation is even worse when basing a test on a difference in sample medians , in the sense that regardless of sample sizes , the asymptotic rejection probability of the permutation test will be @xmath4 under very stringent conditions , which essentially means only in the case where the underlying distributions are the same .",
    "however , in a very insightful paper in the context of random censoring models , neuhaus @xcite realized that by proper studentization of a test statistic , the permutation test can result in asymptotically valid inference even when the underlying distributions are not the same .",
    "this result has been extended to other problems , such as comparing means by janssen @xcite and certain linear statistics in janssen @xcite ( including the wilcoxon statistic without ties ) , variances by pauly @xcite and the two - sample wilcoxon test by neubert and brunner @xcite ( where ties are allowed ) .",
    "other results on permutation tests are presented in janssen @xcite , janssen and pauls @xcite , janssen and pauls @xcite and janssen and pauly @xcite .",
    "the recent paper by omelka and pauly @xcite compares correlations by permutation tests , which is a special case of our general results .",
    "note that the importance of studentization when bootstrapping is well known ; see hall and wilson @xcite and delaigle et al .",
    "@xcite ( though its role for bootstrap is to obtain higher order accuracy while in the context here first order accuracy can fail without studentization ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain a quite general result of the same phenomenon .",
    "that is , when basing a permutation test using some test statistic as a test of a parameter ( usually a difference of parameters associated with marginal distributions ) , we would like to retain the exactness property when @xmath68 , and also have the asymptotic rejection probability be @xmath4 for the more general null hypothesis specifying the parameter ( such as the difference being zero ) .",
    "of course , there are many alternatives to getting asymptotic tests , such as the bootstrap or subsampling .",
    "however , we do not wish to give up the exactness property under @xmath2 , and resampling methods do not have such finite sample guarantees .",
    "the main problem becomes : what is the asymptotic behavior of @xmath57 defined in ( [ equationnewperm ] ) for general test statistic sequences @xmath23 when the underlying distributions differ . only for suitable test statistics",
    "is it possible to achieve both finite sample exactness when the underlying distributions are equal , but also maintain a large sample rejection probability near the nominal level when the underlying distributions need not be equal . in this sense ,",
    "our results are both exact and asymptotically robust for heterogeneous populations .",
    "this paper provides a framework for testing a parameter that depends on @xmath0 and  @xmath1 ( and later on @xmath5 underlying distributions @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) .",
    "we construct a general test procedure where the asymptotic validity of the permutation test holds in a general setting .",
    "assuming that estimators are asymptotically linear and consistent estimators are available for their asymptotic variance , we provide a test that has asymptotic rejection probability equal to the nominal level @xmath4 , but still retains the exact rejection probability of @xmath4 in finite samples if @xmath2 in section  [ secstudentized ] .",
    "it is not even required that the estimators are based on differentiable functionals , and some methods like the bootstrap would not necessarily be even asymptotically valid under such conditions , let alone retain the finite sample exactness property when @xmath71 . in section  [ sectiongeneralization ] , generalizations of the results",
    "are discussed with a special attention to the more general @xmath5-sample problem of comparing general parameters .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulation studies illustrating our results are presented in section  [ secsimulation ] .",
    "the arguments of the paper are quite different from janssen and previous authors , and hold under great generality .",
    "for example , they immediately apply to comparing means , variances or medians .",
    "the key idea is to show that the permutation distribution behaves like the unconditional distribution of the test statistic when all @xmath72 observations are i.i.d . from the mixture distribution @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is such that @xmath75",
    "this seems intuitive because the permutation distribution permutes the observations so that a permuted sample is almost like a sample from the mixture distribution . in order to make this idea precise ,",
    "a coupling argument is given in section  [ sectioncoupling ] .",
    "of course , the permutation distribution depends on all permuted samples ( for a given original data set ) . but even for one permuted data set , it can not exactly be viewed as a sample from @xmath76 . indeed",
    ", the first @xmath77 observations from the mixture would include @xmath78 observations from @xmath0 and the rest from @xmath1 , where @xmath78 has the binomial distribution based on @xmath77 trials and success probability @xmath74 . on the other hand , for a permuted sample ,",
    "if @xmath79 denotes the number of observations from @xmath0 , then @xmath79 has the hypergeometric distribution with mean @xmath80 .",

    "therefore , if the randomization distribution is based on a statistic @xmath321 such that the difference @xmath322 is small in some sense whenever @xmath51 and @xmath309 mostly agree , then one should be able to deduce the behavior of the permutation distribution under samples from @xmath187 from the behavior of the permutation distribution when all @xmath72 observations come from the same distribution @xmath95 .",

    "one great advantage of utilizing the proposed test is that it retains the exactness property in finite samples when @xmath2 , a desirable property that bootstrap and subsampling methods fail to possess .    to summarize , if the true goal is to test whether the parameter of interest @xmath3 is some specified value @xmath403 , permutation tests based on correctly studentized statistic is an attractive choice . when testing the equality of means , for example , the permutation @xmath245-test based on a studentized statistic obtains asymptotic rejection probability @xmath4 in general while attaining exact rejection probability equal to @xmath4 when @xmath2 . in the case of testing the equality of medians ,",
    "the studentized permutation median test yields the same desirable property .",
    "moreover , the results extend to quite general settings based on asymptotically linear estimators .",
    "the results extend to @xmath5-sample problems as well , and analogous results hold in @xmath5-sample problem of comparing general parameters , which includes the nonparametric @xmath5-sample behrens  fisher problem .",
    "the guiding principle is to use a test statistic that is asymptotically distribution - free or pivotal .",
    "then , the technical arguments developed in this paper can be shown that the permutation test behaves asymptotically the same as when all observations share a common distribution . consequently ,",
    "if the permutation distribution reflects the true underlying sampling distribution , asymptotic justification is achieved .    as mentioned in the",
    ", proper implementation of a permutation test is vital if one cares about confirmatory inference through hypothesis testing ; indeed , proper error control of types 1 , 2 and 3 errors can be obtained for test of parameters by basing inference on test statistics which are asymptotically pivotal .",
    "thus , the foundations are laid for considering more complex problems in modern data analysis , such as two - sample microarray genomics problems , where a very large number of tests are performed simultaneously .",
    "( indeed , there are many microarray analyses which have begun by performing a permutation test for each gene , without proper studentization . )",
    "the role of permutations in multiple testing can not be properly understood without a firm basis for single testing .",
    "thus , future work will further develop the ideas presented here so that permutation tests can be applied to other measures of error control in multiple testing such as the false discovery rate ."
