    "stuart , takahashi and umezawa@xcite proposed a microscopic quantum field theory by using operators expressing neurons and intermediating bosons .",

    "another quantum approach is advocated by penrose .",
    "@xcite he insists on the relevance of quantum theory like the problem of observations in quantum mechanics , coupling to quantum gravity , and so on .",
    "it seems ambitious , but interesting and worth enough to scrutinize its validity .",
    "hameroff and penrose@xcite proposed a quantum theory of consciousness .",
    "they claim that objective reductions of wave functions of microtubules , main building blocks of axons connecting neurons , are relevant for our consciousness .",
    "the central physical quantity in their theory is the so called decoherence time @xmath11 , the average time interval between successive reductions .",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to each  moment \" of the stream of one s consciousness .",
    "there are several estimates of @xmath11@xcite , but they seem to be still controvercial each other .    in this paper , we introduce a quantum version of the gauged neural network of learning and recalling@xcite .",

    "this @xmath42 reduces to the hopfield energy ( [ hopfieldenergy ] ) .    to consider generalization of the energy , the principle of gauge symmetry puts severe restrictions on @xmath42",
    "actually , the gauge principle implies that the time evolutions of @xmath10 , @xmath5 , which we shall discuss in sect.[ssec : timeevolution ] in details , are controlled only by those signals that have contacts with them .",
    "for example , @xmath51 consists of terms , each of which has the index @xmath6 like @xmath16 .",
    "this assures us that the flows ( current ) of electric voltages and chemical materials change locally through contact intereactions as it should be .",
    "most of the proposed models of neural networks so far is classical in the sense that these models employ real numbers as their dynamical variables .",

    "the time dependence of wave function , particularly its objective reductions , is argued to be important for understanding consciousness . in ref.@xcite a quantum - field - theoretical model of a microtubule is proposed , hamiltonian of which is described by second - quantized fermionic electron operators .",
    "the model resembles familiar strongly - correlated electron systems like hubbard model , heisenberg model , t - j model , etc .",
    "it is quite interesting to compare these quantum models and existing classical neural - network models to identify the quantum effects .",
    "however , to perform such a comparison explicitly , the present forms of these quantum models are not appropriate ; they involve quantum operators and have complicated structures .",
    "thus it is preferable to obtain their effective models ( at lower energies , i.e. , at macroscopic scales ) that take forms similar to the classical neural networks .",
    "( see fig.2 . ) at this point , we recall the relation between the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schriefer ) model of superconductivity and the gl ( ginzburg - landau ) model of second - order transition .",

    "we have not specified the underlying microscopic theory , although there are some candidates.@xcite this point _ is not _ a flaw but an advantage since the essential characteristics of the effective model at low energies are to be determined by only a few properties of the microscopic model like dimensionality , symmetry , etc .",

    "in short , the critical temperatures ( both @xmath118 and @xmath122 ) of the @xmath68 model is higher than those of the @xmath4 model . from the table 1 , this implies that the ability of learning patterns and recalling them is weakened globally by the quantum effects .",
    "more detailed study of this point is to be done in simulations of individual learning and recalling processes by using the rule of time evolution in sect.[ssec : timeevolution ] .",
    "another significant difference is that @xmath68 model allows us to define the current @xmath100 of ( [ current ] ) as in @xmath102 of ( [ equationofmotion ] ) .",

    "<S> a quantum model of neural network is introduced and its phase structure is examined . the model is an extension of the classical z(2 ) gauged neural network of learning and recalling to a quantum model by replacing the z(2 ) variables , @xmath0 of neurons and @xmath1 of synaptic connections , to the u(1 ) phase variables , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these u(1 ) variables describe the phase parts of the wave functions ( local order parameters ) of neurons and synaptic connections . </S>",
    "<S> the model takes the form similar to the u(1 ) higgs lattice gauge theory , the continuum limit of which is the well known ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> its current may describe the flow of electric voltage along axons and chemical materials transfered via synaptic connections . </S>",
    "<S> the phase structure of the model at finite temperatures is examined by the mean - field theory , and coulomb , higgs and confinement phases are obtained . by comparing with the result of the @xmath4 model , the quantum effects is shown to weaken the ability of learning and recalling . </S>"
