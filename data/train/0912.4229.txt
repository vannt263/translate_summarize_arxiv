    "very high energy ( vhe , @xmath0 ev ) particles can be traced within our galaxy by a combination of non - thermal x - ray emission and vhe gamma - ray emission via leptonic ( i.e. inverse compton scattering of electrons , bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation ) or hadronic ( i.e. the decay of charged and neutral pions , due to interactions of energetic hadrons ) processes .",
    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) detects vhe @xmath3-rays above an energy threshold of @xmath1100 gev and up to @xmath1100 tev with a typical energy resolution of 15% per photon .",

    "survey of the galactic plane , performed in 2006/2007 @xcite , there were indications of a source at the position of hess j1507 - 622 ; follow - up dedicated observations were performed for 9.7 hours ( 21 runs of  28 minutes each ) in 2007 and in 2008 .",
    "hess j1507 - 622 is visible in figure [ 1507 ] .",

    "instrument for these observations is superimposed in magenta . ]    using standard cuts @xcite and hence a lower energy threshold ( @xmath1 500 gev ) , the observed spectrum can be well fitted with a power - law dn / de = k ( e/1 tev)@xmath16 with photon index @xmath17 and a flux normalization @xmath18 tev@xmath9 @xmath8 s@xmath9 ; hence the integral flux ( @xmath19 1 tev ) is @xmath20 @xmath8 s@xmath9 . using hard cuts @xcite ( energy threshold @xmath1 1 tev ) and hence a better gamma - hadron separation , the observed spectrum fits well with a power - law with photon index @xmath21 and a flux normalization @xmath22 tev@xmath9 @xmath8 s@xmath9 ; hence the integral flux ( @xmath19 1 tev ) is @xmath23 @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",

    "at radio and infrared wavelengths , hess j1507 - 622 is too far offset from the galactic plane to be covered by the southern galactic plane survey @xcite and by spitzer glimpse @xcite .",
    "this region of the sky had been covered by the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) in all its wave bands @xcite and by the molonglo galactic plane survey @xcite , but without evidence for any plausible counterpart .",
    "hess j1507 - 622 is located on a radio emission filament , visible in figure [ rad ] , at 2.4 ghz , which was tentatively considered a part of a very large ( @xmath24 in diameter ) and nearby candidate snr @xcite . in the new complete co survey @xcite , the h.e.s.s .",
    "source lies near the edge of a large ( @xmath25 ) nearby co molecular cloud ; the peak velocity of this cloud , around -5 km / s , would most likely place it at the near distance of @xmath1400 pc .",
    "the substantial difference in extension and , in the case of the co molecular cloud , the offset of @xmath26 from the h.e.s.s .",
    "source centroid , suggest no obvious scenario for an association .",
    "at x - rays , the source was observed with xmm - newton in the ao-7 ( proposal number : 055631 ; pi : o. tibolla ) ; but unfortunately the presence of a huge soft proton flare affected dramatically the 25 ks observation , leading us to only 0.8 ks of gti for the pn detector , 8.0 ks for mos1 and 9.2 ks for mos2 .",
    "the gti data have been analyzed with sas 9.0 , discovering one point - like source ( source 7 in figure [ ch ] ) , confirmed by chandra .",
    "the source was observed with chandra in the ao-10 ( proposal number : 10400599 ; pi : o. tibolla ) : figure [ ch ] shows the count map between 0.3 and 8 kev as seen by chandra .",
    "chandra data have been analyzed using ciao 4.1 : 12 point - like sources ( mainly identified as stars ) and one extended source have been discovered .",
    "hints for diffuse emission are visible between source 3 and source 7 in figure [ ch ] , and are still under evaluation .",
    "given past experience , deeper multi - wavelength data has in most cases revealed a possible counterpart , usually pwn or snr , however hess j1507 - 622 is so far unidentified .",
    "the offset can be either interpreted that hess j1507 - 622 is a nearby object and the large angular offset does not correspond to a large physical distance from the disk or that it is truly distant .    both leptonic and hadronic scenarios are currently under investigations . at a location away from the galactic disk ,",
    "the density of target material is quite low , which would make a hadronic scenario for hess j1507 - 622 less favorable . on the other hand , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as target photon field for gamma - ray production , is available everywhere and would point towards a leptonic gamma - ray emission mechanism ; in particular the case of an ancient pwn @xcite is under evaluation .",
    "however , if confirmed by deeper observations , the lack of emission in other wavebands could imply a hadronic origin of hess j1507 - 622 .",
    "the difference in model leads also to a difference in the distance : a leptonic pwn scenario would place this source due to its quite small extension to multi - kpc distance whereas a hadronic scenario would preferentially locate this object at distances of @xmath2 1 kpc where the density of target material is higher .",
    "the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of hess is gratefully acknowledged , as is the support by the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) , the max planck society , the french ministry for research , the cnrs - in2p3 and the astroparticle interdisciplinary programme of the cnrs , the u.k .",
    "science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) , the ipnp of the charles university , the polish ministry of science and higher education , the south african department of science and technology and national research foundation , and by the university of namibia .",
    "we appreciate the excellent work of the technical support staff in berlin , durham , hamburg , heidelberg , palaiseau , paris , saclay , and in namibia in the construction and operation of the equipment ."

    "<S> the search for counterparts in other wavelength regimes ( radio , infrared and x - rays ) failed to show any plausible counterparts ; and given its position off the galactic plane and hence the absorption almost one order of magnitude lower , it is very surprising to not see any counterparts especially at x - rays wavelengths ( by rosat , xmm newton and chandra ) . </S>",
    "<S> its latitude implies that it is either rather close , within about 1 kpc , or is located well off the galactic plane . and also the models reflect the uniqueness of this object : a leptonic pwn scenario would place this source due to its quite small extension to multi - kpc distance whereas a hadronic scenario would preferentially locate this object at distances of @xmath2 1 kpc where the density of target material is higher . </S>"
