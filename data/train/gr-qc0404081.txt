    "many of the important solutions to the einstein field equations can be expressed in kerr ",
    "schild form ( see , for example , the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "these include all black hole solutions , and a range of solutions representing radiation . here we analyse solutions of kerr  schild type from the viewpoint of the gauge theory approach to gravity  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the gravitational fields are gauge fields defined over a flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "these fields ensure that all relations between physical quantities are independent of the position and orientation of the matter fields  a scheme that ensures that the background spacetime plays no dynamic role in the physics and has no measurable properties .",
    "schild metrics are constructed from a null vector field in the background minkowski spacetime , so are particularly well - suited to analysis via this gauge - theoretic approach . in this paper",
    "we show that , for all fields of kerr  schild type , the einstein tensor is a total divergence in the background minkowski spacetime .",
    "various consequences of this result are explored .",
    "gauss theorem is used to convert volume integrals of the einstein tensor to surface integrals , enabling us to probe the nature of the matter singularities generating the gravitational fields .",
    "the gauge - theory viewpoint always produces a metric that satisfies the einstein equations ( or their generalisation to include torsion ) . but working with fields defined over a minkowski background does place additional restrictions on the form of the solutions . for example , general relativity admits two possibilities when dealing with the kerr solution  @xcite    1 .",
    "the complete kerr manifold can be covered by a single set of minkowski coordinates .",
    "this implies a discontinuity in the fields over the entire disk region bounded by the matter singularity .",
    "2 .   the fields are smooth everywhere away from the ring , but an observer passing through the ring emerges in a new , asymptotically flat , region .",
    "this is achieved by extending the radial coordinate @xmath1 to negative values , producing the maximally - extended kerr spacetime .    by adopting a flat - spacetime , gauge - theory formulation",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering case  1 only .",
    "this can be justified on the grounds that the full , maximally - extended kerr solution is not thought to be a feasible endpoint for any collapse process .",
    "similar comments apply to the maximally - extended schwarzschild and reissner  nordstrom solutions , neither of which are considered here .",
    "the first applications we consider are to spherically - symmetric fields , concentrating on the schwarzschild , reissner ",
    "nordstrom and vaidya solutions .",
    "in all cases the integrals provide sensible results for the total energy contained in the fields , with the mass contribution to the energy residing in a point - source @xmath0-function . for the reissner  nordstrom solution the inclusion of gravitational fields removes the infinite electromagnetic self - energy for a point charge familiar from classical electromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "this result is achieved without requiring any form of regularisation procedure , and ensures that the total electromagnetic self - energy is zero .",
    "we next turn to more general fields following the work of schiffer _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that stationary kerr ",
    "schild vacuum solutions are generated by a single , complex generating function .",
    "this complex structure underlies the ` trick ' by which the kerr solution is obtained from the schwarzschild solution via a complex ` coordinate transformation '  @xcite .",
    "( this is a trick because there is no _ a priori _ justification for expecting the complex transformation to result in a new vacuum solution . )",
    "the complex structure associated with vacuum kerr  schild fields is shown here to have a simple geometric origin , with the role of the unit imaginary fulfilled by the spacetime pseudoscalar  the same entity that is responsible for duality transformations of the riemann tensor .",
    "the remainder of this paper deals with a detailed analysis of the kerr solution . for this",
    "we require a careful choice of branch cut in the complex square route in the generating function .",
    "once this is made , gauss theorem reveals the detailed structure of the singular region , confirming that the matter is concentrated in a ring that circulates on a lightlike trajectory .",
    "this is as one would expect , since the riemann tensor only diverges on a ring , and special relativity alone is sufficient to predict that rotating collapsing matter will fall inwards until its velocity becomes lightlike .",
    "a more surprising result is obtained from considering integrals inside the ring , which reveal the presence of a disc of planar tension  @xcite .",
    "this tension is isotropic over the disk and has a simple radial dependence , rising to @xmath2 at the ring .",
    "remarkably , the functional form of the tension has a simple non - gravitational interpretation . in non - relativistic dynamics",
    "a membrane holding together a rotating ring of disconnected particles would be under a constant tension .",
    "when special - relativistic effects are included the picture is altered by the fact that tension can act as a source of inertia .",
    "this introduces a radial dependence into the tension , the functional form of which is precisely that which lies at the heart of the kerr solution .",
    "these conclusions are gauge invariant and are not artifacts of the use of the background spacetime .",
    "this is demonstrated by eigen - decompositions of the stress - energy and riemann tensors , from which we extract the gauge - invariant information .",
    "there has been considerable debate over many years surrounding the nature of sources for the kerr metric .",
    "many physicists have attempted to construct extended sources for which the kerr metric could represent the external geometry ( see krasinski for an early review  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , a series of authors have constructed disk sources for the kerr metric  @xcite .",
    "these solutions represent extended sources and do not have horizons present .",
    "the present work is of a different nature , dealing solely with the structure of the singular region  the endpoint of a collapse process .",
    "the first authors to consider this were newman & janis  @xcite and isreal  @xcite . we disagree with isreal",
    "s result for the energy distribution over the disk , agreeing instead with hamity s later result  @xcite .",
    "our techniques enable us to go some way beyond hamity s description , both in revealing the physical properties of the disk and in understanding the nature of the singularity around the ring .",
    "the simple physics of the disk was first pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "many of the calculations here are simplified by using the language of ` spacetime algebra '  @xcite .",
    "this is crucial to understanding the geometric nature of the complex structure at the heart of kerr  schild solutions .",
    "the algebraic structure of the spacetime algebra is that of the dirac @xmath3-matrices .",
    "using this algebraic structure one can develop a mathematical language that is adept at describing many aspects of relativistic physics .",
    "this language includes a calculus that is somewhat more powerful than any available in alternative languages .",
    "the gauge theory of gravity developed in  @xcite takes on its most natural and compelling form when expressed in the spacetime algebra .",
    "we start with an introduction to the spacetime algebra , giving the necessary conventions and notations .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite and references contained therein .",
    "reference  @xcite includes an appendix describing how to convert between spacetime algebra and more conventional tensor calculus .",
    "natural units ( @xmath4 ) are employed throughout this paper .",
    "the basic algebraic structure behind the spacetime algebra will be familiar to most physicists in the guise of the algebra of the dirac @xmath5-matrices .",
    "the geometric interpretation the spacetime algebra attaches to this algebra may be less familiar , though it is remarkably well - suited to most problems in relativistic physics  @xcite .",
    "the spacetime algebra is generated by four vectors @xmath6 , @xmath7 , equipped with an associative ( clifford ) product denoted by juxtaposition .",
    "the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of this product define the inner and outer products , and are denoted with a dot and a wedge respectively , so @xmath8 and @xmath9 the outer product of two vectors defines a bivector  a directed plane segment representing the plane defined by the two vectors .",
    "a full basis for the spacetime algebra is provided by the set @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 the pseudoscalar @xmath13 squares to @xmath14 , anticommutes with all odd - grade elements and commutes with even grade elements .",
    "both the @xmath15 and @xmath6 are algebraic entities with clear geometric significance .",
    "they should not be thought of as matrices acting on an internal spin space .",
    "( the same symbols as employed in quantum theory are used here simply because the algebraic relations are the same . )",
    "an arbitrary real superposition of the basis elements   is called a ` multivector ' and these inherit the associative clifford product of the @xmath6 generators .",
    "the inner and outer products with a vector @xmath16 are of particular importance . for these",
    "we write @xmath17 the outer and geometric products are associative , but the inner product is not .",
    "we also employ the commutator product , @xmath18 vectors are usually denoted in lower case latin , @xmath19 , or greek for basis frame vectors . in the absence of brackets the inner , outer and commutator products take precedence over geometric products .    an inertial system is picked out by a future - pointing timelike ( unit ) vector .",
    "if this is chosen to be the @xmath20 direction then the @xmath20-vector determines a map between spacetime vectors @xmath21 and the even subalgebra of the full spacetime algebra via @xmath22 where @xmath23 the ` relative vector ' @xmath24 can be decomposed in the @xmath15 frame and represents a spatial vector as seen by an observer in the @xmath20-frame .",
    "relative ( or spatial ) vectors in the @xmath20-system are written in bold type to record the fact that they are in fact spacetime bivectors .",
    "this distinguishes them from spacetime vectors , which are left in normal type .",
    "the @xmath15 generate the ( pauli ) algebra of three - dimensional space , and we occasionally require that the dot and wedge symbols define the three - dimensional inner and outer products .",
    "the convention we adopt is that , if both arguments of a dot or wedge product are written in bold , then the product takes its three - dimensional meaning . for example , @xmath25 is a relative bivector , and so also a spacetime bivector , and not a spacetime four - vector .",
    "the vector derivative , @xmath26 , is defined by @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are a set of cartesian coordinates and the @xmath29 are the reciprocal frame to the associated coordinate frame @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 .",
    "the spacetime split of the vector derivative @xmath26 goes through slightly differently , since we require that the @xmath31 symbol agrees with its conventional three - dimensional meaning .",
    "this is achieved by writing @xmath32 so that @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath26 operator has the algebraic properties of a vector , and often acts on objects to which it is not adjacent .",
    "the ` overdot ' notation is a convenient way to encode this : @xmath34 the @xmath26 operator acts on the object to its immediate right unless brackets or overdots are present .",
    "if brackets are present then @xmath26 operates on everything in the bracket , so that , for example , @xmath35 .",
    "the same rules apply to @xmath31 .",
    "one of the two gravitational gauge fields is the ( position - dependent ) linear function @xmath36 , which maps vectors to vectors ( where @xmath16 is the vector argument ) .",
    "linear functions of this type have their action extended to general multivectors via the rule @xmath37 which defines a grade - preserving linear operation .",
    "the pseudoscalar is unique up to a scale factor , and the determinant is defined by @xmath38 the adjoint is denoted with an overbar , @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath36 and its adjoint are related by  @xcite @xmath40    a number of manipulations in linear algebra are simplified by using the vector derivative in place of frame contractions .",
    "for example , the trace of @xmath36 can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vector derivative with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the following results are also useful : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a multivector of grade @xmath1 and @xmath45 is the dimension of the space .",
    "the gravitational gauge fields are a linear function @xmath39 mapping vectors to vectors and a linear function @xmath46 mapping vectors to bivectors .",
    "both of these gauge fields have an arbitrary position dependence .",
    "the gauge - theoretic origin of these fields is described in  @xcite .",
    "the gauge fields are related by the equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 the argument of the linear function , usually denoted by a vector @xmath16 or @xmath49 , is always assumed to be independent of position . to recover the more conventional representation of general relativity we introduce an arbitrary set of coordinates @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the associated coordinate frame vectors , @xmath52 with @xmath53 denoting the reciprocal frame vectors",
    "we then define the vectors @xmath54 in terms of these the metric tensor is defined by @xmath55 the @xmath39 field ensures that one only ever has to make ` flat - space ' contractions , which is an attractive feature of the gauge - theory approach .",
    "the field strength corresponding to the @xmath46 gauge field is defined by @xmath56 and is a linear function mapping bivectors to bivectors . from this",
    "the covariant riemann tensor is defined by @xmath57 we often write this in the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an arbitrary ( constant ) bivector argument .",
    "the tensor components of the riemann tensor are recovered by writing @xmath60 the ricci and einstein tensors are defined from the riemann tensor in the obvious way , @xmath61 again , the tensor components of the ricci and einstein tensors are easily recovered .",
    "we are interested in fields of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a ( flat - space ) null vector , @xmath64 .",
    "this is the gauge theory analogue of the kerr ",
    "schild ansatz .",
    "the function   extends to act on multivectors as @xmath65 and we see immediately that @xmath66 .",
    "the following results are also useful : @xmath67 in terms of an orthonormal coordinate frame @xmath68 we can write @xmath69 which confirms that the metric is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the flat minkowski metric tensor .    the @xmath46 field defined by",
    "has the simple form @xmath72 where @xmath73 it follows from the fact that @xmath63 is null that @xmath74 and @xmath75    following the route adopted by chandrasekhar  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 57 ) , we next form the quantity @xmath76 substituting equation   into the above we find that @xmath77 if we are looking solely for vacuum solutions , then we can conclude from this that @xmath78 must be null .",
    "since @xmath79 , it follows that @xmath78 must be parallel to @xmath63 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a scalar field .",
    "we will restrict attention to solutions for which this relation does hold , even if matter is present .",
    "( this places a restriction on the form of matter distributions that we can consider . )",
    "it follows from equation   that @xmath46 reduces to the simpler form @xmath82    the riemann tensor now splits into terms that are second - order and fourth - order in @xmath63 .",
    "the fourth - order contribution is @xmath83 after some rearrangement this can be brought to the form @xmath84 both the contraction , @xmath85 , and the protraction , @xmath86 , of this contribution to the riemann tensor vanish .",
    "this can be seen from the result that @xmath87 which holds for any two bivectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the presence of the null vector @xmath63 in the analogous terms in @xmath90 ensures that @xmath91 so that @xmath90 makes no contribution to the ricci tensor .",
    "the only part of @xmath58 that contributes to the einstein tensor is therefore the second - order term @xmath92 contracting this and setting the result to zero we find that the vacuum einstein equations reduce to solving the equation @xmath93 the ricci scalar and einstein tensor are now straightforward to calculate : @xmath94 and @xmath95 the formulae for @xmath46   and @xmath96 are valid for any kerr ",
    "schild type solution for which @xmath97 . for such fields the einstein tensor   is a total divergence in minkowski spacetime . in general , the field equations will be satisfied everywhere except for some singular region over which the fields are discontinuous .",
    "this singular region contains the source of the fields . in this paper",
    "we assume that the entire solution to the einstein equations is described by fields defined over a single minkowski spacetime , so that the manifold has not been subjected to maximal extension .",
    "in this case we can use gauss theorem straightforwardly to convert volume integrals over the source region to surface integrals and so learn how the source matter is distributed . for the case of static fields ,",
    "virbhadra  @xcite gave a formula which agrees with   for the timelike component @xmath98 , but the fact that the expression is a total divergence was not exploited .",
    "as our first application we consider spherically - symmetric solutions . for these",
    "it is useful to introduce a set of polar coordinates : @xmath99 we also define @xmath100 and @xmath101    for spherically - symmetric solutions @xmath63 can be written in the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "for fields of this type it is a simple matter to demonstrate that the fourth - order contribution to the riemann tensor   vanishes . to see this",
    "consider the case of @xmath104 , for which we obtain @xmath105 with the same result holding for @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that the riemann tensor is given entirely by  , which is also a total divergence and so can be analysed using gauss theorem .",
    "we now turn to three applications of these results .",
    "the simplest solution to the field equations is the schwarzschild solution , obtained from @xmath107 as we confirm in section  [ s - comp ] .",
    "the line element generated by this solution is that of the advanced eddington ",
    "finkelstein form of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "the riemann tensor for the solution   can be constructed using equation  , from which we find @xmath108 and @xmath109 away from the origin , these derivatives evaluate to @xmath110 and @xmath111 so we can write the vacuum riemann tensor in the form @xmath112 self duality of the vacuum riemann tensor has the simple expression @xmath113 in the spacetime algebra formalism  @xcite ) .",
    "the form of equation   shows that the riemann tensor is manifestly self - dual .",
    "this form of the riemann tensor   for the schwarzschild solution was first given in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the form of the riemann tensor in equation   is valid everywhere away from the singularity . to study the form of the singularity",
    ", we return to the differential expressions for the riemann tensor and integrate over a sphere of radius @xmath114 , centered on the origin . using gauss theorem to convert the volume integrals to surface integrals , we obtain @xmath115 and @xmath116 these results combine to give @xmath117 which contracts to yield @xmath118 since",
    "@xmath119 everywhere except for the origin , the integrals  can be taken over any region of space enclosing the origin .",
    "it is clear then that the solution represents a point source of matter , with the matter stress - energy tensor given by @xmath120 the same conclusion was reached in  @xcite , where the calculations were performed in a different gauge .",
    "this result confirms feynman s speculation in lecture  15 of  @xcite that `` it will not be possible to demonstrate that @xmath121 _ everywhere _ , but rather that @xmath122 , or something of the kind '' .",
    "the integrals performed above are not gauge invariant , but gauge - invariant information is extracted from them in the form of the matter stress - energy tensor  .",
    "furthermore , the integral of the ricci scalar provides a direct measure of the mass of the source , without the need to resort to constructing integrals in an asymptotically flat region of spacetime .",
    "the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution can be written in the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 the charge of the source ( in natural units ) and @xmath125 the einstein tensor for this solution is @xmath126 away from the origin we know that the mass term can be ignored , which leaves @xmath127 these combine to give a corresponding matter stress - energy tensor of @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "this is the expected form for the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor due to a point source of charge @xmath124 .",
    "( see  @xcite for a detailed explanation of how to handle electromagnetism in gauge - theory gravity . )    to study the behaviour of the fields near the origin we return to the differential form for @xmath96 and again construct integrals over a sphere of radius @xmath114 . for this case",
    "we find that @xmath130 and @xmath131 which combine to give @xmath132 the mass term here is precisely as expected and shows again that a point source is located at the origin .",
    "the electromagnetic contribution is traceless , as one expects for the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor .",
    "focusing attention on the @xmath20-frame energy component of the stress - energy tensor , we see that @xmath133 this result was also obtained by tod  @xcite , who calculated the quasi - local mass for the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution as defined by penrose  @xcite .",
    "tod argued that this result implies that a source for the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution should have @xmath134 at the surface in order to meet the dominant energy condition .",
    "however , this misses the point that the negative contribution to the integral comes entirely from the origin . everywhere off the origin",
    "the stress - energy tensor satisfies the dominant energy condition . taking the integrals over the volume defined by @xmath135 we find that the electromagnetic field energy is @xmath136 , which agrees with the formula given by virbhadra  @xcite and is simply the classical result .",
    "the electromagnetic contribution to   is negative and finite for all finite @xmath114 , and tends to zero as the integral extends over all space .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the standard picture from classical electromagnetism , where the integral of the @xmath20-frame energy @xmath137 diverges for the interior of any surface enclosing the origin  the classical self - energy problem discussed by many authors ( see  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "inclusion of the gravitational field has removed this divergence , ensuring that the total electromagnetic self - energy is zero .",
    "the manner in which this regularisation is achieved is both simple and instructive .",
    "the electromagnetic energy density is rewritten as @xmath138 so that the integral over space of the electromagnetic energy density can be converted to a surface integral , recovering the contribution to  .",
    "since the electromagnetic energy density near a point source is very large , it is unsurprising that the inclusion of gravity has significant consequences , and these clearly have implications for the status of self - energies in classical field theory .",
    "however , since only classical fields are employed above , it is not clear whether this result has similar implications for the divergent self - energies encountered in qed .      as a final example of the use of integral equations for spherically - symmetric kerr  schild fields , we consider vaidya s ` shining star ' solution  @xcite",
    "this is generated by the field @xmath139 which is clearly similar to the schwarzschild solution , except that now the mass @xmath140 is variable and the null geodesics @xmath104 are outgoing rather than incoming .",
    "the solution   is clearly of kerr  schild type , and defining @xmath63 by @xmath141 we find that @xmath142 so that equation   is satisfied .",
    "the einstein tensor for   is @xmath143 and away from the origin ( where we can set @xmath144 ) this becomes @xmath145 where @xmath146 .",
    "this tensor represents a radially - symmetric flux of outgoing massless particles .",
    "again , the presence of a @xmath0-function point source at the origin can be inferred from the differential form of the einstein tensor . by evaluating the integral of @xmath96 over a sphere centred on the origin , and shrinking the radius to zero , we find that @xmath147 the solution   therefore describes a point mass at rest at the origin which is losing mass at some arbitrary rate .",
    "this is borne out by the riemann tensor , @xmath148 which exhibits a neat split into a source term describing the energy outflow and a weyl term due to the point mass at the origin .",
    "the fact that the einstein tensor is given by the divergence of a bivector implies that @xmath149 we can therefore define a conserved total energy @xmath150 by @xmath151 the total conserved energy is therefore determined by the mass of the source at @xmath152 , before it began radiating , which is clearly a sensible result .",
    "a conserved energy of this form will exist for any kerr  schild field of the type  , provided that the null vector @xmath63 satisfies @xmath153 .",
    "we now turn to a more general analysis , dropping the requirement of spherical symmetry .",
    "as we are ultimately interested in the kerr solution , however , we do restrict to stationary , vacuum solutions .",
    "for these we write @xmath63 in the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 @xmath156 , and @xmath157 and @xmath158 are functions of the spatial position vector @xmath159 only .",
    "this is the most general form for a stationary , kerr  schild field .",
    "the condition that @xmath160 immediately yields @xmath161 hence @xmath162 and @xmath163 the final equation shows that the integral curves of @xmath158 are straight lines .",
    "these define possible incoming photon trajectories in space .",
    "the fact that these lines a straight in the background space is a gauge - specific statement , and does not correspond to a physically - observable property .",
    "for stationary vacuum fields the equation @xmath164 splits into the pair of equations @xmath165 and @xmath166 to simplify equation   we need the result that @xmath167 on splitting into spatial vector and bivector parts equation   reduces to @xmath168 and @xmath169      the content of the second field equation   is summarised neatly in the equation @xmath170 in  @xcite the authors showed that this equation implies that we can write @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are two new real scalar functions .",
    "we see immediately that @xmath174 and it follows that @xmath175 now , setting @xmath176 in equation  , we obtain @xmath177 similarly , writing equations   in the form @xmath178 and differentiating we obtain @xmath179 on combining these equations we find that @xmath180 and we can therefore write @xmath181 this equation is simplified by employing the idempotent element @xmath182 , @xmath183 which satisfies @xmath184 ( an idempotent is a mixed - grade multivector that squares to give itself .",
    "spacetime idempotents are usually closely related to null vectors . ) on postmultiplying by @xmath182 , equation   yields @xmath185 where @xmath186 it follows that @xmath187 so that , if we define @xmath188 by @xmath189 then @xmath188 must satisfy @xmath190 this is the first of the pair of complex equations found in  @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of the derivation presented here is that the ` complex ' quantity @xmath3 is of the form of a scalar @xmath191 pseudoscalar .",
    "this gives a clear geometric origin to the complex structure at the heart of the kerr solution .",
    "this complex structure carries through to the form of the riemann tensor , and hence to all of the observable quantities associated with the solution .",
    "use of the idempotent @xmath182 simplifies many expressions and derivations .",
    "for example , differentiating   and pre- and post - multiplying by @xmath182 yields @xmath192 but we know that @xmath193 and @xmath194 , so we can rearrange the final term as follows : @xmath195 this type of rearrangement is typical of the way that one can take advantage of the properties of idempotents in the spacetime algebra .",
    "on substituting this result into equation   we now find that @xmath196 and hence @xmath197 this is the second of the pair of complex equations found in  @xcite . solving the field equations now reduces to finding a complex harmonic function @xmath3 whose inverse @xmath188 satisfies @xmath198 .",
    "the above derivation reveals the geometric origin of this complex structure , as well as demonstrating the role of the null vector @xmath45 through the idempotent @xmath182 .    to complete the solution we need to find forms for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . for the former we note that @xmath199 and @xmath200 from these it is a simple matter to show that @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is some arbitrary constant . to recover @xmath158 we use equation   in the form @xmath203 where the @xmath204 denotes the complex conjugation operation ( which can be written as @xmath205 ) .",
    "on rearranging we obtain @xmath206 where the angle brackets @xmath207 denote the projection onto the scalar part of a multivector .",
    "recall here that the @xmath208 symbol represents half the commutator of the terms on either side , and not the vector cross product .",
    "some further insight into the nature of the solution and the role of the complex structure is obtained from the form of @xmath209 . from equations   to   it",

    "the fact that the trajectories are straight lines in the background space is a feature of our chosen gauge .",
    "the same picture is not produced in alternative gauges , though the fact that the integral curves emerge from the central disk region is gauge invariant .",
    "oblate spheroidal coordinates are very useful for performing surface integrals in the kerr solution over regions entirely surrounding the disk .",
    "the most convenient surfaces to consider are ellipsoids of constant @xmath252 , for which the divergence theorem can be given in the form @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath59 are general multivectors .",

    "our aim is to explore the nature of the matter singularity through the use of integral equations . as a first step , we look at the total mass - energy in the source . taking the surface as one of constant @xmath252",
    "we find that @xmath259 so , as the with schwarzschild case , the total mass - energy in the @xmath20-frame is @xmath202 . for the spatial part",

    "the remaining integral to be performed transforms to @xmath262 in terms of the corresponding matter stress - energy tensor @xmath263 the above results are summarised by @xmath264 where the integral is over any region of space entirely enclosing the central disk .    integrating the matter stress - energy tensor over the entire disk region averages out any possible angular momentum contribution .",

    "one has to be careful with the application of oblate spheroidal coordinates in this region , and it is safer to return to cylindrical polar coordinates for most calculations .",
    "central to an understanding of this region is the definition of the complex square root in  .",

    "the integral is performed by splitting into the two regions @xmath316 and @xmath317 and rotating each of the contours to lie on the positive imaginary @xmath283 axis .",
    "this leaves six integrals to compute ( shown in figure  [ figbranch ] ) which combine as follows : @xmath318 these combine into the simpler integrals @xmath319 which are easily evaluated with cosh substitutions .",
    "the cutoff @xmath49 is introduced since the separate integrals are divergent .",
    "on performing the substitutions we find that @xmath320 so that @xmath321 since the solution is axisymmetric , @xmath322 can only depend on @xmath291 and @xmath283 .",
    "we must therefore have , for @xmath284 , @xmath323 where @xmath324 is found from differentiating  : @xmath325 the function @xmath324 is remarkably simple , given the convoluted route by which it is obtained .",
    "however , its true significance is not seen until the remaining gauge - invariant information has been extracted from @xmath96 .",
    "this information resides in the eigenvalues of @xmath96 , the calculation of which introduces further complexities .      to calculate the full form of @xmath96 over the disk , we start with the most general form that @xmath96 can take consistent with the fact that the kerr solution is axisymmetric .",

    "calculation of each of the terms in @xmath96 proceeds in the same manner as the calculation of the ricci scalar .",
    "the resulting computations are long and somewhat tedious , and have been relegated to appendix  [ calcs ] .",
    "the final results are that , for @xmath279 , @xmath328 these confirm that @xmath96 is symmetric , so there is no hidden torsion .",
    "we see immediately that @xmath329 is an eigenvector of @xmath96 , with eigenvalue @xmath330 , and also that there is no momentum flow in the @xmath331 direction , which is physically obvious .",
    "the structure of the remaining terms is most easily seen by introducing the boost factor @xmath332 via @xmath333 and defining the timelike velocity @xmath334 ( this second use of the symbol @xmath78 should not be confused with the vector @xmath335 defined earlier . ) with these definitions we see that , over the disk , @xmath336 and @xmath337 there is therefore zero energy density in the @xmath78 direction , with isotropic tension of @xmath338 in the plane of the disk .",
    "this conclusion is gauge invariant , since it is based solely on the eigenvalue structure of the einstein tensor .",
    "it is truly remarkable that such a simple picture emerges from the complicated set of calculations in appendix  [ calcs ] .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath78 defines the natural rest frame in the region of the disk .",
    "a second velocity is defined by the timelike killing vector @xmath339 ( see  @xcite for details of how killing vectors are handled within gauge - theory gravity . ) the boost required to move between these velocities therefore provides an intrinsic definition of the field velocity in the disk region . in this region",
    "the function @xmath39 reduces to the identity , so @xmath340 is simply @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that the velocity is given by @xmath341 and the angular velocity is therefore @xmath342 .",
    "this is precisely as expected for a rigid rotation , which fits in with the observation of  @xcite that the kerr solution can be viewed as the limiting case of a rigidly - rotating matter distribution .",
    "the form of the eigenvectors of @xmath96 suggest that the more appropriate gauge for the study of the kerr solution is provided by the boost @xmath343 so that the new solution is generated by @xmath344 in this gauge the tension lies entirely in the @xmath345 eigenplane , and the characteristic bivector of the riemann tensor becomes @xmath346 which is now a relative spatial vector . in this gauge",
    "the @xmath20 frame is the rest frame defined by the weyl and matter tensors , whereas the killing vectors are now swept round .",
    "the boost   is well - defined everywhere except for the ring singularity where the matter is located .",
    "this is unproblematic , since the fields are already singular there .",
    "we know that the integral of the ricci scalar over the disk gives @xmath347 which accounts for the entire contribution to @xmath348 found for integrals outside the disk .",
    "it follows that the contribution to the stress - energy tensor from the ring singularity must have a vanishing trace , so that no contribution is made to the ricci scalar .",
    "it is also clear that the entire contribution to the angular momentum must come from the ring , since the tension is isotropic over the disk . from these considerations",
    "it is clear that the contribution to @xmath96 from the ring singularity , in the gauge defined by  , must be of the form @xmath349 this confirms that the ring current follows a lightlike trajectory  the natural endpoint for collapsing matter with angular momentum .",
    "the radius of the orbit , @xmath229 , agrees with the minimum size allowed by special relativity ( see exercise  5.6 of  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "a natural question is whether the tension field has a simple non - gravitational explanation .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the equations for a special relativistic fluid are @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the energy density , @xmath352 is the pressure and @xmath78 is the fluid velocity ( @xmath353 ) . for the case of a ring of particles surrounding a rigidly - rotating massless membrane under tension",
    "we see that ( ignoring the factors of @xmath354 ) , @xmath355 and @xmath356 if follows that @xmath357 so the equation for @xmath352 is @xmath358 this has the solution @xmath359 which has precisely the functional form of the tension distribution found above .",
    "the constant @xmath360 is found by requiring that the trace of the stress - energy tensor returns @xmath202 when integrated over the disk .",
    "this fixes the tension to @xmath338 , precisely as is built into the gravitational fields .",
    "of course , the required ` light ' membrane can not be made from any known matter .",
    "indeed , the fact that the membrane generates a tension while having zero energy density means that it violates the weak energy condition .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite remarkable that such a simple physical picture holds in a region of such extreme fields .    in writing the tension as @xmath338",
    "we are expressing it in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath291 .",
    "this coordinate is given physical significance by the fact that the @xmath361 function is the identity over the disk region , so @xmath291 is the proper distance from the centre of the disk .",
    "this gives a simple gauge - invariant definition of @xmath229 as the physical radius of the disk .",
    "furthermore , the form of the riemann tensor   shows that its complex eigenvalues are driven by @xmath362 , which is gauge - invariant , and hence a physically - measurable quantity .",
    "this affords gauge - invariant significance to @xmath202 and @xmath188 , and hence to the coordinates @xmath291 and @xmath283 .",
    "it follows that both @xmath229 and @xmath202 have simple gauge - invariant definitions , without needing to appeal to the asymptotic properties of the solution .",
    "many of the significant solutions to the einstein equations can be represented in kerr  schild form and gauge - theoretic approach of  @xcite is well suited to their analysis .",
    "for all solutions of kerr  schild type where the null vector @xmath63 satisfies @xmath363 the einstein tensor is a total divergence in flat spacetime .",
    "the structure of the sources generating the fields can therefore be elucidated by employing gauss theorem to transform volume integrals to surface integrals .",
    "this approach is fully justified within the gauge - theory formulation , since one only ever deals with fields defined over a flat spacetime .    for the case of the schwarzschild , reissner ",
    "nordstrom and vaidya solutions the gravitational fields are seen to result from a @xmath0-function point source of mass at the origin . for the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution the @xmath0-function point source is surrounded by a coulomb field .",
    "an unexpected bonus of this approach is that the infinite self - energy of the coulomb field is removed by the gravitational field .",
    "similar techniques can be applied to kinnersley s and bonnor s work on accelerating and radiating masses  @xcite , as will be discussed elsewhere .    applied to more general stationary , vacuum solutions",
    "we find that the complex structure at the heart of vacuum kerr  schild fields is the same as the natural complex structure inherent in the weyl tensor through its self - duality symmetry .",
    "further algebraic insights are obtained through the use of null vectors as idempotent elements , simplifying many of the derivations of the vacuum equations .",
    "both of these insights highlight the algebraic advantages of the spacetime algebra approach .",
    "a further example of this is seen clearly in equation  , which gives a remarkably simple and compact expression for the riemann tensor .",
    "the application of gauss theorem to the kerr solution reveals some surprising features of the singularity .",
    "the ring of matter follows a lightlike trajectory and surrounds a disk of tension .",
    "the tension distribution over the disk is precisely that predicted by special relativity .",
    "the correct tension distribution was computed by hamity  @xcite , though he did not comment on its origin in terms of classical relativistic physics .",
    "we find no evidence of either the negative surface energy density or the superluminal speeds claimed by isreal  @xcite . both hamity and isreal asserted that they used the same results for surface layers in general relativity , but neither gave detailed calculations , so the reason for isreal s disagreement with our result is hard to pin down .",
    "almost all trajectories in the kerr geometry finish up on the disk , rather than the ring .",
    "quite what happens when a particle encounters the @xmath0-function tension over the disk is unclear and can only really be understood using a quantum framework to study the effect of the disk on a wavepacket .",
    "( a start on such an analysis in made in  @xcite . ) assuming that all geodesics do terminate on the disk then any non - causal features of the kerr solution are removed  @xcite , which is a physically attractive feature of the picture presented here . the fact that the tension membrane violates the weak energy condition raises a further interesting question  how can it be formed from collapsing baryonic matter ?",
    "furthermore , if baryonic matter can not form the membrane , then what is the endpoint of the collapse process ?",
    "answers to these questions will only emerge when realistic collapse scenarios are formulated , though these are notoriously difficult computations to perform .",
    "the discussion in this paper implicitly rules out considering any extensions to the manifold , such as obtained by converting the schwarzschild solution to kruskal coordinates .",
    "we therefore do not consider distinct universes connected by schwarzschild ` throat ' , with separate future and past singularities  @xcite , or the maximum analytic extension of the reissner ",
    "nordstrom geometry with infinite ladder of possible ` universes ' connected by wormholes  @xcite . in such scenarios",
    "the applications of gauss theorem employed in this paper would not be valid .",
    "while infinite ladders of connected universes remain popular with science fiction writers , there is no reason to believe they could ever form physically in any collapse process .",
    "the descriptions presented here for both the reissner  nordstrom and kerr solutions have a much more plausible physical feel to them , even if the final description of the singular region must ultimately involve quantum gravity .",
    "one final speculation concerns the nature of the membrane supporting the kerr ring singularity .",
    "this bears a remarkable similarity to some of the structures encountered in string theory , and it would be of great interest to see if string theory can provide a quantum description of such a source .",
    "from the form of   there are 16 scalar functions to find using extensions of the technique described in section  [ ricci ] .",
    "these are evaluated below .      for this term",
    "we have @xmath365 and @xmath366 and @xmath367 are computed directly from @xmath368 on converting to a surface integral we obtain @xmath369 which shows that @xmath370 .",
    "( here @xmath371 refers to the complex field @xmath372 , and not to a reciprocal frame vector .",
    "when a @xmath373-vector is intended the @xmath5 will always appear with a subscript . )",
    "the final term on the right - hand side of   is the integral already performed for the ricci scalar . for the remaining term",
    "we need @xmath374 where it is again crucial that the correct branch cuts are employed in the evaluation of the contour integral . substituting this result into",
    "we find that @xmath375 and differentiating recovers @xmath376    for the remaining terms we first observe that @xmath377 so we must have @xmath378 . to find @xmath379 we need to apply the divergence theorem twice : @xmath380 with @xmath381 as given by equation  .",
    "this time , differentiating yields @xmath382 reassuringly , this term vanishes on the axis , as it must do for a valid axially - symmetric solution .      for @xmath383",
    "we can write @xmath384 this time we find that @xmath385 the final term vanishes because @xmath386 is an odd function of @xmath283 .",
    "it follows that @xmath387 .",
    "the same argument as at equation   shows that @xmath388 , and for @xmath389 we construct @xmath390 where we have again used the fact that @xmath391 is an odd function of @xmath283 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath392 , which is physically reasonable .      for these terms",
    "we write @xmath395 the calculations are now complicated by the fact that the vector arguments are functions of position . to get round this problem",
    "we must find equivalent integrals in terms of the fixed @xmath396 and @xmath397 vectors .",
    "we first form @xmath398 which shows that @xmath399 .",

    "this result confirms that @xmath96 is symmetric over the disk and therefore that there are no hidden sources of torsion .",

    "a similar trick is used to evaluate the final term : @xmath413 this evaluates to @xmath414 where @xmath381 is as defined in equation  .",
    "we do not need to evaluate the final integral since we are only interested in the derivative of the right - hand side .",
