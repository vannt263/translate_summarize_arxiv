    "the resulting proton spectrum is shifted to lower energies in comparison to what might be expected from an instantaneous two  electron ejection .    in spite of the simplicity of the above picture , a quantitative prediction of the proton spectrum as a function of the ultrashort pulse parameters is not straightforward because of the complicated nonlinear couplings leading to single and double ionizations .",

    "they found that the strong dependence of the double ionization yields is due to the return energy of the rescattering electron .",
    "here we address the question of the carrier - envelope dependence of the proton spectra from double ionization at laser intensities where double ionization is mainly sequential . in the nonsequential regime ,",
    "tong and lin have shown that the proton spectra lie within the same proton energy range @xcite .",
    "moreover at laser intensities above @xmath102  w@xmath3 and a pulse duration of 5  fs , proton spectra from nonsequential double ionization are found to be independent on the initial phase .",

    "the sequential ionization of the ion is more delayed at @xmath101 than at @xmath100 , thus resulting in a higher proton energy when @xmath100 .",

    "this effect was also observed in multiple ionization of nitrogen and oxygen with pulse durations of 40  fs and 10  fs and comes from sequential electron emission @xcite . the time delay between the first ionization and the second ionization ,",
    "leading respectively to h@xmath4 and to h@xmath1  +  h@xmath1 , is reduced because the necessary instantaneous intensity for the second ionization comes sooner when the laser intensity is increased .",
    "the experimental spectra are reasonably well reproduced by the model predictions with some differences mainly in the high energy sides of the spectra . in spite of these discrepancies",
    ", the model predicts the correct energy range of the expected proton spectra at 10  fs for different laser intensities .",
    "it therefore constitutes a worthy predictive tool for the use of ultrashort pulses when one considers the very complicated dynamics of the hydrogen molecular response .",
    "several effects might explain the observed differences in addition to the laser and ion measurements uncertainties .",
    "the calculation is performed for one laser intensity and thus does not take into account the intensity distribution within the focal volume .",
    "this might explain the discrepancies in the high  energy wings of the spectra where nonsequential double ionization does play a noticeable role at low laser intensity @xcite .",
