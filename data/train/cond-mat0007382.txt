    "physical laws of motion are time reversible . as a consequence , from a movie of a few interacting particles one can not distinguish whether the movie is running forward or backward .",
    "this seems to be different when we observe a very large number of particles .",
    "macroscopic properties like the density of particles show a direction of time .",
    "if the milk in the coffee shrinks to a single drop we know that the movie is running backward .",
    "more than a hundred years ago ludwig boltzmann gave convincing arguments for the irreversible macroscopic behaviour of particles moving with reversible microscopic laws .",
    "the fraction of initial states which leads to reversible macroscopic behaviour is so extremely small that we will never be able to observe it . with probability one ,",
    "we observe a time s arrow in macroscopic properties .",
    "hence , through the selection of the initial state , the deterministic motion receives probabilistic elements .",
    "in fact describing a large system of interacting particles by either a stochastic motion ( boltzmann transport equations ) or ensemble theory ( statistical mechanics ) turned out to be very successful .",
    "however , the success of boltzmann s ideas did not suppress the discussion about the foundations of irreversible properties , even hundred years later @xcite .",
    "for example , there was a round table discussion on this subject on the statphys 98 conference @xcite , where prigogine introduced novel microscopic laws which are irreversible with time .",
    "one reason for this ongoing discussion is the absence of rigorous mathematical proofs of irreversible properties in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "furthermore , solvable models where irreversible macroscopic properties can be well defined and investigated almost do not exist , to our knowledge .",
    "either one studies stochastic models like the famous one of paul and tanja ehrenfest @xcite , or disorder averages as for the kac ring @xcite , or ensembles of chaotic noninteracting particles as in the lorentz gas @xcite . however , a single trajectory of interacting particles is difficult to investigate in this context .",
    "numerical simulations of the equations of motions do not help much in this context , either .",
    "the algorithms can be formulated in a time reversible way and the decay of boltzmann s h  function has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "however , the state space is too large to study any details , for instance to estimate the fraction of untypical inital states or to find the time scale of the poincar return time .",
    "one should keep in mind that we want to understand the property of a _ single _",
    "trajectory for a _ short _ time .",
    "hence , ensemble averages do not give a basic explanation of irreversible properties , since they contain an average over infinitely many trajectories .",
    "ergodic theory does not help either , since it needs time averages over infinitely large times ( at least up to the poincar return time ) whereas real physical systems or computer simulations run over time scales which are extemely short compared to the return time .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a model with deterministic time reversible dynamics which can be analysed in detail .",
    "it is a deterministic extension of the ehrenfest model discussed in section [ stochehr ] .",
    "the dynamics is ergodic",
    ", each state is visited once during a cycle .",
    "the poincar return time is known exactly and the boltzmann and gibbs entropies can be defined precisely . from numerical calculations",
    "we obtain the distribution of first passage times the system needs to go from a non equilibrium state to a state with largest boltzmann entropy as well as in the reverse direction .",
    "the scaling of average first passage times with system size is calculated .",
    "finally we compare the results of the deterministic model with the corresponding ones of the stochastic version of the ehrenfest model .",
    "the microscopic state @xmath0 of our model has @xmath1 binary variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 the time @xmath4 is discrete . at each time",
    "step a new bit @xmath5 is generated and replaces @xmath6 , whereas the old bits @xmath7 are moved one step to the right :    @xmath8    the last bit @xmath9 is deleted .",
    "the new bit @xmath5 is constructed using the theory of primitive polynomials modulo two which is also used to generate pseudo random numbers @xcite . if @xmath5 is the sum modulo two of a few bits @xmath10 at certain positions @xmath11 , then any initial state @xmath12 runs through all possible states @xmath0 except the state zero @xmath13 .",
    "for instance for @xmath14 one finds from the table of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath15 in our investigation we use such sequences with maximal cycle length , taking the generators from @xcite for @xmath16 and from @xcite for higher @xmath1 .",
    "for the macroscopic property @xmath17 , which we will investigate , we take the number of @xmath18 , @xmath19 note that at each time step @xmath20 changes by @xmath21 at most . the original ehrenfest model considered @xmath1 balls in two urns .",
    "@xmath22 means that ball @xmath11 is in the left ( right ) urn .",
    "@xmath20 is the number of balls in the right urn . in the ehrenfest model",
    "the balls were chosen randomly . here",
    "we define a deterministic rule to move the particles between the two urns .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ zwei ] ) and ( [ drei ] ) are time reversible ; for instance from ( [ drei ] ) one finds @xmath23 hence , from the first and seventh bit of state @xmath24 one calculates the 97@xmath25 bit of @xmath26 , and a shift to the left gives the rest of @xmath26 .",
    "we have now defined a model where time and states are discrete .",
    "it has the following properties :    1 .",
    "the equations of motion are deterministic and time reversible",
    "each initial state returns to itself after @xmath27 time steps ; i.e. the poincar return time is @xmath28 .",
    "the boltzmann entropy @xmath29 is given by the number of microstates @xmath0 which have the macroscopic property @xmath20 . since the distribution of macrostates is the binomial distribution ( with the exception of the zero state ) , @xmath30 one finds for the entropy in dimensionless units : @xmath31 4 .",
    "since each state @xmath0 is visited once during each cycle , it has an identical statistical weight in a gibbs ensemble .",
    "hence , the gibbs entropy @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 5 .",
    "the system is ergodic . when the system is observed over the return time @xmath34 , the time average @xmath35 agrees with ensemble average @xmath36 : @xmath37 = \\langle m \\rangle = \\frac{n}{2 } \\ \\ .\\ ] ] 6 .",
    "the most probable value of @xmath20 agrees with time and ensemble average , @xmath38 there are @xmath39 states @xmath0 whith @xmath40 .",
    "we call these states _ equilibrium states_.    during a cycle , the average time interval between two consecutive equilibrium states increases with @xmath41 according to eq .",
    "( [ zehn ] ) .",
    "we investigate the two following questions :    1 .",
    "when the system starts from an initial state @xmath0 which is far away from equilibrium , for instance with @xmath42 , how long does it take to reach an equilibrium (= most probable ) state ? 2 .",
    "when the system starts from an equilibrium state , @xmath43 , how long does it take to reach a non - equilibrium state with @xmath44 ?",
    "we call these two time intervals first passage time @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "both of these times depend on the special choice of the initial state , therefore we obtain a distribution of first passage times . fig .",
    "[ sh - fpt ] shows the result for @xmath47 which is obtained from simulations of all @xmath48 states .",
    "the time @xmath45 to reach an equlibrium state has a sharp peak around @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , the time to leave equilibrium has a broad distribution extending from the minimal possible time @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "since the system is time reversible , the distribution of equilibrium times should be part of the distribution of non - equilibrium times @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , we observe the corresponding peak in fig .",
    "[ sh - fpt ] .",
    "but surprisingly there are more equilibrium states which reach non equilibrium ones for the first time in short than in long times .",
    "the distribution of @xmath46 has its maximum for values of the order of @xmath1 , while the tail can be fitted to an exponential distribution @xmath52 where @xmath53 is of the order of the average non - equilibrium time @xmath54 , averaged over all initial equilibrium states .    in figs .",
    "[ sh - rel ] and [ sh - inv ] it is shown how the average value of these times scales with system size @xmath1 .",
    "for small systems @xmath55 we average over all possible initial states whereas for large systems we average over several hundred randomly selected initial states .",
    "we obtain a good fit with @xmath56 hence , the time to reach equilibrium is short , it scales with system size @xmath1 , whereas the time to reach a state far from equilibrium is very long and increases exponentially with @xmath1",
    ". a lower bound on @xmath57 can be found for any system whose distribution of macrostates is the binomial distribution : take a sequence of @xmath58 equilibrium states followed by one nonequilibrium state with @xmath59 , repeated as often as necessary .",
    "incidentally , this lower bound differs only by a factor of @xmath60 from the average return time of the non - equilibrium state .",
    "choosing an initial occupation @xmath61 , the lower bound can be approximated for large @xmath1 using stirling s formula : @xmath62 for @xmath63 , this gives @xmath64 the exponent is close to the fit given in eq .",
    "( [ elf ] ) . together with the upper bound @xmath65 one obtains exponential scaling with @xmath1 .",
    "we find that usually @xmath46 is proportional to the return time of the non - equilibrium state , with a proportionality constant that depends on the details of the generator ( for example , if a two - tap or four - tap register is chosen , see fig .",
    "[ sh - inv ] ) .",
    "[ sh - ent ] shows the time dependence of the boltzmann entropy @xmath66 , averaged over initial states with @xmath44 ( non - equilibrium ) and @xmath67 ( equilibrium ) , respectively .",
    "the non - equilibrium entropy decays to its equilibrium value @xmath68 in @xmath1 time steps , since every bit @xmath10 is visited and `` randomized '' exactly every @xmath1th time step .",
    "starting from equilibrium states , the entropy stays constant .",
    "note that after the poincar return time @xmath34 , @xmath29 has to return to its initial value . but the time to reach equilibrium is of the order of the microscopic time , whereas the return time @xmath34 increases exponentially with system size .",
    "the original ehrenfest model describes a stochastic process : @xmath1 balls are distributed among two urns . at every time step , a ball is picked at random and moved to the respective other urn ; @xmath20 is the number of balls in one of the urns .",
    "this process can be mapped to a random walk with drift @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is the position of the walker , who at each time step performs a step @xmath69 with probability @xmath70 hence , there is a drift towards the center @xmath67 . to our knowledge ,",
    "analytic calculations of first passage times exist only between equilibrium states @xcite , whereas we are interested in the decay to or from non equilibrium states .",
    "we have calculated these times from numerical iteration of the corresponding transition matrices using absorbing states @xcite .",
    "the average times for different system sizes are shown in figs .",
    "[ sh - rel ] and [ sh - inv ] in comparison with the corresponding deterministic model ; the distribution of times for @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ef - fpt ] .",
    "again , the decay time @xmath45 to equilibrium scales with @xmath1 ( although with more pronounced finite - size effects ) while the time to reach a non equilibrium state from an equilibrium one increases exponentially with system size . indeed",
    "the stochastic model has similar properties as the deterministic one .",
    "there are several deterministic algorithms which change only one bit per time step and run through all of the @xmath71 configurations of the bit sequence @xmath0 .",
    "one of them is the gray code @xcite : find the largest power @xmath72 by which the discrete time @xmath4 is divisible and change bit @xmath73 .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 changes by @xmath21 only , and the system runs through all of the @xmath71 possible states",
    ". however , now the access to the different variables @xmath74 is hierarchical ; it takes @xmath75 steps before site @xmath76 is visited again .",
    "this hierarchical structure of microscopic dynamics leads to slow relaxation times of the macroscopic property @xmath20 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ expmag ] .",
    "the time to reach an equilibrium state from an initial non - equilibrium one scales exponentially with system size @xmath1 .",
    "there is a corresponding stochastic version of the gray code :    * start with @xmath77 * with probability @xmath78 , increase @xmath76 by 1 ; else flip @xmath74 , increase @xmath4 by one and return to the first step ; * if @xmath79 , increase @xmath4 and return to the first step ; else repeat the second step .",
    "the ensemble average of @xmath20 decays as @xmath80 the simulations of the stochastic model agree with eq .",
    "( [ vierzehn ] ) ; however , in the deterministic gray code , @xmath36 shows structures caused by  almost returns  after times that are multiples of high powers of @xmath81 ( see fig .",

    "we have also calculated the first passage time to equilibrium , and find that it scales with @xmath90 .",
    "a simple model with time reversible deterministic dynamics is investigated .",
    "the poincar return time is @xmath91 , where @xmath1 is the size of the system ; each initial state returns to itself after @xmath91 time steps .",
    "we define a macroscopic quantity @xmath87 and study its time dependence .",
    "when the system starts from an equilibrium state ( state with most probable value of @xmath20 ) it takes on average an exponentially large time before it reaches a state far from equilibrium . on the other side ,",
    "when the system starts far from equilibrium it reaches an equilibrium state after a period of the order of the microscopic time .",
    "the same is true for the corresponding boltzmann entropy .",
    "this behaviour explains the time s arrow in macroscopic properties for a system with time reversible dynamics .",
    "we have calculated the full distributions of these first passage times and compared them to the ones of the corresponding stochastic ehrenfest model .",
    "surprisingly the distribution of times the system needs to reach non - equilibrium for the first time reaches a maximum at times of order @xmath1 and monotonically decreases for larger times .",
    "however , the integral of @xmath46 over short times is small compared to the total number of equilibrium states .",
    "therefore , on average the time to leave equilibrium scales exponentially with system size .",
    "if our computer needs @xmath92 steps per second , eq .",
    "( [ zwoelf ] ) gives the age of the universe for @xmath93 .",
    "even for our simple model the return to non - equilibrium can not be observed in reasonable time for @xmath1 significantly larger than 70 .",
    "all these results hold only for a model with identical microscopic times for all of the local variables .",
    "we have also studied models with hierarchical or power law access times . in these cases the relaxation to equilibrium",
    "is slowed down . the time to reach equilibrium scales exponentially or with a power of system size , depending on the distribution of microscopic times",
