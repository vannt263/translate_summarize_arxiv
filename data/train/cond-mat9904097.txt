    "since the papers by tsallis @xcite , non - extensive statistical formalism has been shown to be not only _ robust _",
    "it allows generalizations of all necessary fundamental concepts of thermostatistics @xcite , but also _ useful _",
    "it provides a suitable theoretical tool to explain some of the experimental situations where standard thermostatistics has shortcomings , due to the presence of long - range interactions , or long - range memory effects , or ( multi)-fractal space - time constraints. see ref .",
    "@xcite for a periodically updated bibliography .",
    "+ the core of this generalized formalism is defined through a generalized entropy s_q = k , ( q ) , where @xmath1 is a positive constant , @xmath2 is a set of probabilities and @xmath3 is the total number of microscopic configurations .",
    "it is easy to verify that the @xmath4 limit immediately recovers the usual ( extensive ) boltzmann - gibbs entropy .",
    "moreover , if a composed system @xmath5 has probabilities which factorize into those corresponding to the subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , then @xmath8 .",
    "this property clearly exhibits the fact that the parameter @xmath9 characterizes the degree of non - extensivity of any physical system .",
    "+ the generalization of quantum statistics for non - extensive systems was only accomplished , up to recent days , in an _ approximate fashion _ , by using two different schemes .",
    "one of them is the asymptotic approach ( aa ) , of tsallis et al .",
    "@xcite , the other one is the factorization approach ( fa ) , of bykkili et al . @xcite .",
    "the physical applications studied so far within these two approximations include the blackbody radiation @xcite , the stefan - boltzmann constant @xcite , and some aspects of the early universe physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the aa has also been used in some other works such as the bose - einstein condensation @xcite , the specific heat of @xmath10he @xcite , thermalization of an electron - phonon system @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "although some detailed analysis on these approximate schemes @xcite suggest that both schemes could be helpful in physical applications at least , for @xmath11-order corrections , this was still doubtful .",
    "a complete verification needed a comparison between the results of these approximate schemes and the exact ones .",
    "but an exact treatment of non - extensive quantum distributions was not available up to the recent papers of rajagopal et al . @xcite . just after this work , lenzi and mendes have also given an exact treatment of blackbody radiation @xcite .",
    "all these recent efforts enable us to make a comparison between the approximate and exact schemes , which will ultimately show whether the aa and the fa are useful or not .",
    "this will be the main purpose of this paper .",
    "+ in section ii , we review the approximate and exact results and develop an analytical method to derive the explicit form of any measurable quantity within the aa .",
    "we compare the approximate and exact results in section iii using ( i ) the predictions of one of the experimental tests suggested in @xcite and ( ii ) the blackbody radiation .",
    "finally , we give our final comments in section iv .",
    "within the aa , namely in the @xmath12 limit , the generalized partition function is given by @xcite    z_qz_1 \\{1 - 12 ( 1-q ) ^2 _ 1 } , from where the generalized distribution function of non - interacting bosons can be found , up to @xmath11-order , as [ naa ] _ q = _ 1 + ( 1-q ) _ 1 \\{(1/z_1 ) + ( x- ) } , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and _ 1 = , _ 1 = , _ 1 = .",
    "the standard ( @xmath15 ) partition function is given by z_1 = .",
    "this approximation has found a wide range of applications up to now , however , no attempt has been made for deriving some of the thermodynamical quantities within this approach , directly using eq .",
    "( [ naa ] ) .",
    "+ one aim of this paper is to provide a technique for computing , in a closed form , the kind of integrals needed to find the average number of particles within the aa . to do this ,",
    "let us start by writing down the definition of the average number of particles : [ bosn ] _ q = _",
    "0^ ^1/2 _ q d , where all variables have the usual meaning .",
    "( [ naa ] ) and the definitions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , this expression turns out to be _",
    "q = , where i_st = _ 0^ , i_2 = _ 0^ , and i_3 = _ 0^ . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 order correction to the standard ( @xmath15 ) result and here @xmath21 stands for the standard integral appearing in the solution of the extensive case @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath18 have standard forms , and could easily be solved as : i_st = ( 3/2 ) g_3/2(z ) , [ 2resul ] i_2 = _ 0^ - _",
    "0^ = ( 5/2 ) g_3/2(z ) - ( 3/2 ) g_3/2(z ) , where @xmath22 is the fugacity and is defined as @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath19 is more involved , and it takes the form : [ 3resul ] i_3 = a+b-3c - d , where a= _ 0^ , b= _ 0^ , c=_0^ , d=_0^ . in an appendix , we provide an analytical technique ( maybe there are others ) to compute each one of these integrals . using this technique ,",
    "we obtain the average number of particles as : _",
    "q = ( 3/2 ) g_3/2(z ) + ( q-1 ) + . here",
    ", @xmath24 stands for the number of particles in the excited states ( @xmath25 ) . as in the standard case",
    ", we have separated the contribution of the state given by @xmath26 , which has zero weight in the integrals . for this level of energy",
    ", we found , _ q",
    "(= 0 ) = \\ { 1 + ( q-1 ) } .",
    "when @xmath27 , all the correction terms go to zero .",
    "when @xmath28 , some of the terms are divergent but the usual shape is unchanged",
    ". this can be seen in fig .",
    "+ numerical analysis , which we show in fig .",
    "2 , illustrates that the maximum correction is attained for @xmath29 .",
    "then , the number of particles in all excited states is bounded by , [ neaa ] _ q .",
    "it is worth noticing that the aa is such that not all terms in the @xmath11 correction are positive ( or negative , depending on the choice of @xmath9 ) definite . moreover , their maximum values are not always attained at middle points of the interval of interest , and although they do have bounded expressions , the maximum correction is obtained only for @xmath29 .",
    "this differs from what happened in the fa , where each term had a maximum value within the interval of interest @xcite .",
    "the order of magnitude of the maximum correction is , however , the same in both approximations .",
    "+ any interested reader could easily apply the same technique , which we introduced in the appendix , to compute any other thermodynamical quantity , whenever it is needed .      within the fa @xcite , the generalized distribution function of bosons is given , at @xmath11 order , by @xcite [ nfa ] _ q = _ 1 + ( q-1 ) , where @xmath30 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same definitions as before . at this point ,",
    "the remarkably simpler form of this result , when compared to the result of the aa [ eq .",
    "( [ naa ] ) ] , is worth emphasizing .",
    "+ in this context , we have found general expressions for some thermodynamical quantities of bosons and fermions @xcite ; here we quote only the average number of particles for bosons , since it will be adequate for our proposed comparison and should have a minus sign in front of it @xcite . ] : [ nefa ] _ q .",
    "although the results of the aa and the fa have been successfully used in a wide range of physical applications , an exact treatment of non - extensive quantum statistics was lacking until the recent work of rajagopal , mendes and lenzi @xcite . in their analysis ,",
    "they have given the many - particle @xmath9-green function in terms of a parametric contour integral over a kernel , multiplied by the usual grand canonical one particle green function which now depends on @xmath9 .",
    "they managed to obtain exact expressions for thermodynamical quantities , such as @xmath31 .",
    "+ to proceed further , let us quote here some of the results of @xcite .",
    "rajagopal et al .",
    "have used the general contour integral of the form , b^1-z _ c du ( -bu ) ( -u)^-z = , with @xmath32 and re @xmath33 , and where the contour @xmath34 starts from @xmath35 on the real axis , encircles the origin once counterclockwise and returns to @xmath35 . using the @xmath9-green functions , and after some cumbersome algebra , they finally obtain ( for bosons ) _ q = v _ c du k_q^(2)(u ) _",
    "-^ a(p ; ) , where @xmath36 is the dimension of space , @xmath37 is the spectral weight function and k_q^(2)(u ) = i ( -u)(-u)^-1/(1-q ) , and z_q ( , ) = _ c du k_q^(1)(u ) z_1(-u(1-q ) , ) .",
    "this exact expression for the average number of particles finally gives us the opportunity to make a comparison between the exact and the approximate results .",
    "one of possible experimental tests of the validity of the @xmath9-framework is based on a recent work on bose - einstein condensation of a small number of atoms ( of the order of 100 to 170 ) , confined to a small region of space by magnetic trapping @xcite . by taking free particle spectral weight function , namely @xmath38 , near the bose - einstein condensation",
    ", they have found    [ nqn1exact ] ^3/2 \\{1 + ^3/2 .",
    "+ . } . here , the @xmath39 sign reflects that this equation is valid near the bose - einstein condensation , which does not change the fact that it is an exact result .",
    "we may now expand this expression in powers of @xmath20 .",
    "up to first order ,    [ nqn1exactapprox ] ^3/2 \\ { 1 + ( q-1 ) ( 0.456 - 0.023 _ 1 ^3/2 ) } .",
    "the two previous equations deviate from each other very soon when @xmath40 is not negligible .",
    "+ let us now derive similar expressions for the aa and fa in order to compare them with eqs .",
    "( [ nqn1exact ] ) and ( [ nqn1exactapprox ] ) .",
    "the condition for the appearance of bose - einstein condensation can be expressed as _ q > _ q .",
    "alternatively , with constant @xmath31 and @xmath41 , using eq .",
    "( [ neaa ] ) for the aa and eq .",
    "( [ nefa ] ) for the fa , this condition can be recast in the form t < ( t_c)_q = \\ { } ^2/3 , where @xmath42 for the aa and @xmath43 for the fa .",
    "then , we can organize these expressions to give [ nqn1appr ] = ^3/2 .",
    "eq.(17 ) and ( 19 ) have corrections which are trivial ( not depending on @xmath22 ) just because we have approximated them : the actual complete results are eqs.(15 ) and ( 16 ) for the aa , while those for the fa can be found in our previous paper [ 24 ] .",
    "we managed the dependence on @xmath22 in order to obtain an upper bound for the corrections and simplify the analysis that follows .",
    "differences between eqs .",
    "( [ nqn1appr ] ) and ( [ nqn1exactapprox ] ) are worth noticing : the later depends on @xmath44 and @xmath45 in a much stronger way . however , as we shall see , for @xmath9 close to 1 these differences are not important .",
    "+ we would now like to choose physically suitable @xmath9 values .",
    "an early universe test based on the fa has shown @xcite to produce a bound @xmath46 , thus we have @xmath47 . the other @xmath9 value which we use comes from a very recent work on pion transverse - momentum correlations in pb - pb high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite . in that work",
    ", a deviation of @xmath48 from the standard statistics is found to be sufficient for eliminating the puzzling discrepancy between theoretical calculations and experimental data @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall use @xmath49 ( in fact , in @xcite , @xmath50 has been used , but since the exact result is given for @xmath51 values , we must take @xmath49 , which has the same @xmath52 deviation ) . in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath53 versus @xmath54 for two representative values of @xmath45 , and the two quoted values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , note again that in our approximated schemes , @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 is in fact independent of the particular value of @xmath55 . from fig .",
    "3 , the following conclusions can be drawn : at the order of such @xmath9 values , the aa and the fa are almost the same , and in @xmath11-order correction , any of them could be used with the same confidence ( maybe the fa would be preferable due to its remarkably simpler form ) . only in those situations of extremely high experimental precision one could distinguish between the exact and approximate results .",
    "very recently , an exact analysis of the blackbody radiation within the @xmath9-framework has been given @xcite .",
    "this exact analysis gives the generalization of the stefan - boltzmann law as [ uexact ] u_q = _ m=0^ , where z_q = _",
    "m=0^ , and _ 3 = ( ) ^3 .",
    "let us now recall the stefan - boltzmann law derived by using the aa @xcite and the fa @xcite : [ uappr ] u_q = where @xmath56 for the aa and @xmath57 for the fa .",
    "+ for the comparison of the exact and approximate stefan - boltzmann laws , we again try to choose a value of @xmath9 which is in accordance with the blackbody radiation .",
    "the possible @xmath9-correction could be at the order of @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "thus , here we shall use again the largest deviation predicted for the @xmath9-correction @xcite , namely @xmath60 , which gives @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "4 we present the behaviour of the exact [ eq .",
    "( [ uexact ] ) ] and the approximate results [ eq .",
    "( [ uappr ] ) ] for @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen from the figure that for such order of @xmath9-correction the approximate results are very close to the standard ( @xmath15 ) case without exhibiting any curvature , contrary to the exact result .",
    "we have managed to develop an analytical technique to express thermodynamical quantities for the asymptotic approach of quantum distribution functions .",
    "we have shown that , for simple boson systems , and for all @xmath9-values admitted by the existing bounds , both approximate schemes ( the aa and the fa ) are in agreement with the exact result ( see figures ) .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation is quantified in previous formulae and could be seen if there is enough experimental precision .",
    "otherwise , the simpler form that the factorization approach exhibits makes a case for its use as a standard and safe procedure for @xmath11-order corrections .",
