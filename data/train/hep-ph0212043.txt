    "recent developments in hypernuclear physics require us knowledges of the interactions among strange hadrons , such as hyperons ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,  ) and kaons .",
    "much efforts have been made to analyze experimental data to draw the consistent picture of the hyperon interactions . yet",
    "the most fundamental quantities , i.e. , the meson - baryon coupling constants , which are essential in constructing the meson exchange forces of baryons , have been treated as free parameters . there",
    "the su(3 ) invariance of the coupling constants is often employed without foundation . under these circumstances",
    ", it is highly desirable to calculate the meson - baryon coupling constants from the fundamental theory .    in this report",
    ", we present a qcd sum rule calculation of the coupling constants of the pseudoscalar mesons to the octet baryons . the qcd sum rule has been successful in determining the masses and couplings of various hadrons in terms of the qcd vacuum condensates and the other fundamental constants . in applying the sum rule technique ,",
    "several technical points are carefully considered first .",
    "the soft pion ( and other pseudoscalar mesons ) is often used in deriving the sum rule for the coupling constants .",
    "we stress that the finite meson momentum should be considered in order to obtain reliable sum rule .",
    "we need to choose the dirac structure of the correlation function carefully so that the sum rule is practically workable .",
    "it is also necessary to check dependence on the choice of the interpolating field operator for the baryon .",
    "the last point is especially important in deriving the f / d ratio for the coupling constants .    in section 2",
    ", we present the formulation for the sum rule of baryon - diagonal coupling constants and the results of the borel sum rule analyses .",
    "we derive the f / d ratio in the analysis in the su(3 ) limit . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the sum rule for the @xmath6 coupling constant as an example of the baryon - off - diagonal case , where we use the projection method to define the coupling constant unambiguously .",
    "we analyze baryon - diagonal meson - baryon couplings @xmath10 for meson @xmath11 and baryon @xmath12 .",
    "we construct qcd sum rules from the two - point correlation function with an external meson field @xmath13 |{\\cal m}(p){\\rangle } , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 is general baryon current without derivative .",

    "therefore , it is necessary to go beyond the soft - meson limit and determine the coupling constants independently of mass sum rule .    when going beyond the soft - meson limit , we have three distinct dirac structures ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) in the correlation function  @xcite as @xmath25 from each dirac structure , we obtain sum rules for the coupling constant @xmath26 as @xmath27   \\ = \\",

    ", sum rules from any dirac structure @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be used to determine the couplings . in practice , however , different prediction is derived because reliability of the sum rule varies depending on the dirac structure",
    ". therefore one must carefully choose pertinent dirac structure .",
    "first , we point out that the sum rules from @xmath35 structure is highly sensitive to the continuum threshold @xmath41 and thus is not reliable . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum rules from @xmath33 and @xmath36 structure are insensitive to @xmath41 and more appropriate than those from @xmath35 structure  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) gives a new constraint . in the su(3 ) limit ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 has a common @xmath19 dependence and thus the ratios of different couplings are @xmath19 independent .",
    "we find that the sum rules from @xmath36 structure satisfy the above constraint well , while the sum rules from @xmath33 structure do not .",
