    "[ log ]    am her type variables are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in which the magnetic field of the white dwarf controls the geometry of the material flow between the main - sequence donor and the white dwarf primary as well as synchronizes the white dwarf spin period with the binary orbital period ( see e.g. warner 1995 for a detailed review ) .",
    "the inflow of matter along the magnetic field lines ( of one or occasionally also two magnetic poles ) is decelerated above the white dwarf surface producing a shock front .",
    "this region is thought to emit hard x - rays ( usually modelled in terms of thermal bremsstrahlung of 1020 kev ) and polarized cyclotron radiation ( hence these systems are named also polars ) in the ir to uv range . in addition , a strong soft component has been frequently observed from polars which is thought to arise from the heated accretion pole ( usually modelled in terms of blackbody emission with 2050 ev temperature ) .",
    "it is this soft x - ray component which has led to the discovery of a few dozen new polars by  observations over the last 8 years , most notably the  all - sky survey ( e.g. beuermann & burwitz 1995 for a first summary ) .",
    "based on these discoveries , the strength of the soft component ( or more precisely the ratio of the blackbody and the bremsstrahlung component ) has been found to increase with the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf . since simple reprocession of the hard component can not produce the observed soft x - ray fluxes , a scenario of high-@xmath5 , blobby accretion has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the soft excess ( kujpers & pringle 1982 ) . in a different approach ,",
    "bremsstrahlung emission is gradually replaced by more efficient cyclotron cooling at high magnetic field strengths ( woelk & beuermann 1996 ) .",
    "the source described here has been discovered as a result of a systematic survey for supersoft x - ray sources in the all - sky survey data ( see greiner 1996 for details of this survey ) which revealed a large number of cvs and single white dwarfs .",
    "other polars identified from this sample include v844 her = rxj1802.1 + 1804 ( greiner , remillard and motch 1995 , 1998 ) , rs cae = rxj0453.44213 ( burwitz  1996 ) , and rxj1724.0 + 4114 ( greiner , schwarz and wenzel 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we present photometric , spectroscopic and x - ray observations ( summarized in tab .",
    "[ log ] ) which led to the discovery of another polar ,   ( henceforth referred to as 9 ) .",
    "9  was scanned during the  all - sky - survey over a period of 4 days in december 1990 for a total observing time of 430 sec .",
    "its mean count rate in the position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) was 0.13 cts / s , and the hardness ratio @xmath6 where @xmath7 is defined as ( h  s)/(h+s ) , with h ( s ) being the counts above ( below ) 0.4 kev over the full pspc range of 0.12.4 kev .",
    "[ t ]    for the timing analysis the source photons were extracted with a radius of 4 .",
    "the background was chosen at the same ecliptic longitude at @xmath81   distance , corresponding to background photons collected typically 15 sec before or after the time of the source photons .",
    "standard corrections were applied using the dedicated exsas software package ( zimmermann  1994 ) .",
    "the rass light curve folded over the best - fit period as derived in section 3 is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the x - ray flux shows 100% modulation with a peak count rate of @xmath90.4 cts / s and a pronounced long faint - phase where the x - ray flux is nearly zero ( formal count rate of @xmath10 cts / s ) .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum and strong variability immediately suggested the cataclysmic variable nature .",
    "indeed , using the best - fit x - ray coordinate derived from the all - sky survey data only one optical object brighter than 20@xmath11 was found within the error circle ( see fig . [ fc ] ) which later was identified spectroscopically as a polar ( see section 4 ) .    dedicated",
    "follow - up pointed  observations were performed in november 30  december 4 , 1993 and june 1 , 1994 with the pspc and on december 8 , 1997 with the high - resolution imager ( hri ) .",

    "observations were performed mostly with the @xmath17 filter , though a few exposures also were made with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters .",
    "exposure times ranged between 10600 sec .",
    "observational details are listed in tab .",
    "the images were processed using the profile - fitting scheme of the dophot reduction package ( mateo & schechter 1989 ) to achieve high accuracy .",
    "the optical light curve is characterized by a broad bright phase and a shallow 0.3 mag deep faint phase .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray intensity variations are much more pronounced and show a clear on / off - like behaviour .    in order to derive an orbital period we carried out a period search using the analysis - of - variance method ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) for both , the optical photometry data as well as the combined  pspc pointings and the phase - dispersion method ( stellingwerf 1978 ) for the  all - sky survey data . the resulting periodograms ( fig . [ perio ] ) show a variety of maxima which are predominantly caused by the poor sampling rather than the intrinsic variability",
    ". a more closer look at the bottom two panels ( optical and  pointing data ) suggests that common periods of 123 , 134 or 149 min are possible ( 134 min is the most reliable period from the  pointed data alone ) .",
    "inclusion of the  all - sky survey data clearly favours the 134 min period though we caution that due to the orbital motion of the satellite ( 96 min ) the signal may be affected .",
    "we note also that the actual best - fit period of the  all - sky survey data is 132.5 min , thus being slightly smaller than the period derived from the optical and pointed  data .",
    "note that for each data set ( corresponding to the three panels in fig .",
    "[ perio ] ) a slightly different best - fit period is obtained though the errors ( which we consider to correspond to the width of the peak ) overlap .",
    "overall , based on the appearance of the folded light curves ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) according to a criterion of `` greatest simplicity '' we feel that @xmath20 = 134@xmath13 min is our best estimate ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ perio ] ) .",
    "the identification spectrum of the likely counterpart was obtained on march 26 , 1995 with the eso 2.2  m telescope at la silla / chile and was exposed for 30 min .",
    "we used the efosc ii spectrograph equipped with a 1k@xmath211k thomson ccd detector with a 450  / mm grism ( corresponding to about 8.5  / pixel ) covering the optical wavelength range from 30009000  .",
    "the observation was performed under stable photometric conditions and accompanied by measurements of the standard star lt4816 .",
    "we additionally applied a correction using the @xmath17 magnitude derived from a direct image taken just prior to the spectroscopic observation to calibrate the flux with an accuracy of @xmath22% ( using standard midas procedures ) . by convolving the original spectrum with functions representing the @xmath23 bandpasses we arrive at @xmath24 , @xmath25 mag and @xmath26 with a mean error of @xmath10.2 mag for 9 .    the resulting spectrum plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ ospec ] reveals strong emission lines with of the balmer series and typical for a cv .",
    "the high - excitation line @xmath27    is quite prominent .",
    "its strength ( 2/3 of the h@xmath28-flux ) and the inverted decrement of the balmer lines clearly indicate a magnetic nature of the object .",
    "we further deconvolved the optical spectrum by fitting a power - law in the blue range between 38005000  . after subtracting this blue continuum contribution",
    "the late - type companion is revealed by the slope of the continuum in the near  ir and obvious flux depression due to the tio absorption throughs which are best seen in the @xmath29  7053 and 7667   bandheads .",
    "the faintness of the features prevents an accurate quantitative estimate of the spectral type , but the low ratio @xmath30 of the flux deficits @xmath31(6165 ) to @xmath31(7667 ) suggest that it is later than dm  3 .",
    "the expected parameters for a roche - lobe filling secondary in a 134 minute system are @xmath32m@xmath33 , @xmath34r@xmath33 and a spectral type between m  4.55.5 , for which the zams mass - radius and mass - spectral type relations of patterson ( 1984 ) and kirckpatrick & mccarthy ( 1994 ) were used .",
    "the distance of 9 can be estimated from the observed strength of the m - dwarf using the method of bailey ( 1981 ) . in the following",
    "we take the dm  4.5 star gl 83.1 ( @xmath35 ) as a template and assume that both m - stars have the same colour @xmath36 ( leggett 1992 ) . by comparing the measured flux deficits in the @xmath37-band in gl 83.1 and that of 9 ( 1800  10@xmath38 and 0.2  10@xmath38  )",
    ", we derive a @xmath39 magnitude of 165 for the secondary in 9 .",
    "if we take this value and @xmath40 from the surface brightness relationship of beuermann &  weichhold ( 1998 ) a distance of @xmath41 pc is deduced .",
    "the error includes an uncertainty of 25% for both , the flux calibration and the scaling of the tio band deficits .",
    "detailed phase - resolved spectroscopic studies of selected systems , e.g. am her ( davey & smith 1996 ) , qq vul ( schwope  1998 ) and rx j0203.8 + 2959 ( schwarz  1998 ) have demonstrated that absorption features from the illuminated side of the secondaries in magnetic cvs can be heavily suppressed due to the strong x / uv irradiation from the accretion region .",
    "we therefore caution that the distance derived from our single spectrum with unknown viewing geometry of the binary system can serve as an upper limit only .",
    "after subtraction of a suitably scaled spectrum of gl 83.1 two broad emission humps at @xmath29 5500 and 7400   clearly stand out in the red part of the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ ospec ] , lower panel ) , which we tentatively identify as cyclotron lines from the hot optically thin post - shock region .",
    "an unambiguous estimate of the magnetic field strength is difficult to achieve with only two distinct humps observed .",
    "their separation favours an interpretation as the 3rd and 4th harmonic of the cyclotron fundamental , in which case the field strength is 52@xmath42  mg slightly depending on the plasma temperature and the yet unknown field orientation .",
    "an alternative interpretation as the 4th and 5th harmonics , in which case @xmath17 is @xmath43  mg , can not not completely excluded but results in a distinct mismatch of the expected humps with the shape of the continuum between 60007000  .",
    "normalized cyclotron absorption coefficients for both cases assuming @xmath44 and @xmath45  kev shown in fig .",
    "[ ospec ] illustrate this ambiguity .",
    "the two pointed pspc observations have resulted in the detection of nearly 800 photons thus enabling spectral investigation . for the spectral analysis",
    "the source photons of the two pspc pointings were merged and then extracted with a radius of 15 .",
    "the background was chosen from concentric circles around the source region with a radius of 3 .",
    "other nearby sources were cut out , and the background area normalized to the source extraction area before the background subtraction .",
    "standard corrections were applied using the dedicated exsas software package ( zimmermann  1994 ) . as a first step ,",
    "we have considered the total spectrum as collected during each of the two observations ( after merging ) . adopting a blackbody plus a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( the temperature of the latter fixed to 20 kev ) we find that there is no need at all for the inclusion of the bremsstrahlung component , that is the spectral fit does not require any spectral component for hard emission ( fig .",
    "[ xspec ] ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit temperature of the blackbody component is 10@xmath17 ev and the absorbing column @xmath46=6.4@xmath2110@xmath47 @xmath48 , e.g. about 50% of the total galactic absorbing column in this direction ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "however , this gives an unrealistic high luminosity for a cataclysmic variable due to the very low temperature .",
    "if we fix the temperature at the canonical value of 20 ev , the best - fit absorbing column is only @xmath46=2.4@xmath2110@xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "the difference in reduced @xmath49 is only marginal for all temperatures in the 1025 ev range .    as a second step",
    "we have investigated the emission during the off - state phase intervals which has been observed for a total of 7340 sec . selecting time intervals where the 60 sec averaged",
    "x - ray intensity is less than 0.05 cts / s , we find that the residual emission is consistent with being background radiation .",
    "the mean count rate during the x - ray bright phase ( at @xmath500.05 cts / s ) is 0.38 cts / s in the pspc .",
    "considering only the x - ray bright phase , the unabsorbed fluxes of the two model components in the  band ( 0.12.4 kev ) are @xmath51 = 5.1@xmath52  ( using kt@xmath53=20 ev for comparison purposes ) and @xmath54 @xmath559.8@xmath2110@xmath56 , giving a small flux ratio of @xmath54/@xmath57 .",
    "the mean bolometric luminosity during the x - ray bright phase is ( again with kt@xmath53=20 ev ) @xmath58 = 2.4@xmath2110@xmath59 ( d / 100 pc)@xmath60 erg / s .",
    "the measured period of @xmath61 min places 9  in the 23 hr cv period gap which is thought to be due to the transition from orbital angular momentum loss by magnetic braking ( p@xmath50 3 hr ) to gravitational radiation ( p@xmath55 2 hr ) ( king 1988 ) . over the last years , more polars",
    "have been found with periods in the 23 hr range thus re - initiating the debate on the existence and significance of the period gap for magnetic systems ( wickramasinghe & wu 1994 , wheatley 1995 ) .",
    "the shape of the x - ray light curve strongly argues for a self - eclipsing polar .",
    "the length of the x - ray bright phase of @xmath30 phase units suggests ( within our limited accuracy ) an one pole accreting geometry such that the accretion region passes behind the limb of the white dwarf for half the orbital period .",
    "the lack of eclipses implies @xmath62 .",
    "the strongly modulated soft x - ray emission , the seemingly synchronous rotation , the strength and relative intensities of the balmer and emission lines as well as the cyclotron humps in the optical spectrum clearly suggest the polar nature of 9  though no polarimetric measurements have been made .",
    "more detailed optical photometry and phase - resolved spectroscopy as well as polarimetry are needed to determine the system parameters of this new polar .",
