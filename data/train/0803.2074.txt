    "given a smooth real projective variety @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 , we consider the topology of a connected component @xmath2 of the set @xmath1 of its real points .",
    "john nash proved in @xcite that any compact connected differentiable manifold @xmath2 is obtained in this way , and went over to ask whether the same would hold if one assumes @xmath5 to be geometrically rational .",
    "however , when @xmath5 is a surface of negative kodaira dimension , one is able , after the work of comessatti @xcite for geometrically rational surfaces , to deduce drastical restrictions for the topology of @xmath2 .",
    "namely , if @xmath2 is orientable , then it is diffeomorphic to a sphere or to a torus : in other words , @xmath2 can not be simultaneously oriented and of hyperbolic type . in this note",
    ", we make a step towards a complete classification of the topological types for @xmath2 when @xmath5 is a rationally connected 3-fold fibred by rational curves ( this is one of the higher dimensional analogues of comessatti s theorem ) .",
    "this study was initiated by jnos kollr , in the third paper @xcite of a ground - breaking series of articles applying the minimal model program to the study of the topology of real algebraic 3-folds .",
    "kollr s philosophy is that a very important condition in order to obtain restrictions upon the topological type of @xmath1 is that @xmath5 has terminal singularities and @xmath7 is cartier along @xmath1 .",
    "kollr proved in particular that if @xmath5 is a smooth 3-fold fibred by rational curves ( in particular , @xmath5 has negative kodaira dimension ) and such that @xmath1 is orientable , then a connected component @xmath2 of @xmath1 is essentially a seifert fibred 3-manifold or the connected sum of a finite number of lens spaces .",
    "note that in @xcite it was shown that conversely all the above manifolds @xmath2 do occur for some smooth 3-fold @xmath5 fibred by rational curves .",
    "when @xmath5 belongs to the subclass of rationally connected 3-folds fibred by rational curves , kollr proved some additional restrictions upon @xmath2 and made three further conjectures . in our first note",
    "@xcite we proved two of the optimal estimates that kollr conjectured to hold . in the present note",
    "we prove the third estimate , which is the most important one since it allows us to conclude in particular that , if @xmath2 is a seifert fibred 3-manifold , then the base orbifold can not be simultaneously oriented and of hyperbolic type .",
    "let us now introduce our results in more detail .",
    "let @xmath2 be an oriented three dimensional compact connected topological manifold without boundary . take a decomposition @xmath8 with @xmath9 maximal and observe that this decomposition is unique by a theorem of milnor @xcite .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the case where @xmath10 is seifert fibred or a connected sum of lens spaces .",
    "we consider the integers @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 defined as follows :    1 .",
    "if @xmath14 is a seifert fibration , @xmath15 denotes the number of multiple fibres of @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the respective multiplicities ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a connected sum of lens spaces , @xmath15 denotes the number of lens spaces and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the orders of the respective fundamental groups ( thus we have a decomposition @xmath20 for some @xmath21 relatively prime to @xmath22 ) .",

    "we infer that , if the underlying manifold @xmath46 is orientable , then the euler characteristic of the compact 2-dimensional orbifold @xmath4 is nonnegative ( see proposition  [ proporbi ] ) .",
    "thus , by the uniformization theorem for compact 2-dimensional orbifolds , @xmath4 admits a spherical structure or an euclidean structure .    in general , a 3-manifold @xmath2 does not possess a geometric structure , but , if it does , then the geometry involved is unique .",
    "moreover , it turns out that every seifert fibred manifold admits a geometric structure .",

    "the six above geometries are called the seifert geometries .",

    "suppose moreover that @xmath10 possesses a geometric structure . by theorem  (",
    "1.1 ) , the geometry of @xmath10 is one of the six seifert geometries .",
    "conversely , by @xcite , any orientable three dimensional manifold endowed with any seifert geometry is diffeomorphic to a real component of a real projective 3-fold fibred by rational curves .",

    "observe moreover that in @xcite all compact 3-manifolds with @xmath54 or @xmath48 geometry , and some manifolds with @xmath55 geometry , are realized as a real component of a real smooth projective rationally connected 3-fold fibred by rational curves .",
    "there remains of course the question about what happens when @xmath2 is seifert fibred over a nonorientable orbifold @xmath4 : is the orbifold still not of hyperbolic type ? in the last section we show that the answer to this question is negative . we produce indeed an example of a smooth 3-fold @xmath5 , fibred by rational curves over a du val del pezzo surface @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is orientable , and contains a connected component which is seifert fibred over a nonorientable base orbifold of hyperbolic type .",
    "the striking fact is here that @xmath3 is a real minimal surface : this contrasts with comessatti s theorem : since indeed a real minimal nonsingular geometrically rational surface can not have an component which is of hyperbolic type .",
    "[ hyperbolic ] there exists a minimal real du val del pezzo surface @xmath3 of degree @xmath56 having exactly two singular points , of type @xmath57 , and such that the real part @xmath35 has a connected component containing the two singular points and which is homeomorphic to a real projective plane .",

    "sections  [ sec : recall ] and  [ sec : sevenconfig ] are devoted to the reduction of the proof of the main theorem to the assertion of non existence of seven configurations of singular points on a real component of a du val del pezzo surface of degree  1 .",
    "two main methods used here are borrowed from @xcite : namely , the generalization of brusotti s theorem to the effect that one can independently take any smoothing of the singularities of a du val del pezzo surface , and also the use of the plane model where the family of hyperplane sections of the quadric cone @xmath62 is represented by the family of parabolae in the plane with a fixed asymptotic direction .",
    "these methods combine with a delicate argument , suggested by e. brugalle , excluding the possibility of an intersection of @xmath62 with a cubic surface yielding an irreducible curve @xmath63 with four real cusps ( see [ 4cusps ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : config ] introduces the main tools used in the proof ( the topological classification of real smooth del pezzo surfaces of degree 1 , and the choice of the appropriate partial smoothings ) , and ends with the exclusion of two configurations via complicated although elementary topological considerations .    section  [ sec : euler ] uses a classification of critical points for the projection of @xmath63 and a precise table for the local contributions to the multiplicity of the discriminant and for the local contribution to the euler number in order to exclude two more cases .",
    "section  [ sec : lasteuler ] proves theorem  [ teo : main ] by excluding the three remaining cases by combining all the previous tools with an ad hoc analysis and with two new tools , namely : the use of the comessatti characteristic , relating the total betti number of the real part with the one of the complex part , and the calculation of the contributions of the singularities to the picard and to the various euler numbers .",
    "finally , section  [ sec:3fold ] is devoted to the proof of lemma  [ lem : question2 ] and in section  [ orbi ] , after showing that the base orbifold can not be oriented and hyperbolic , we exhibit the example of a projectivized tangent bundle over a du val del pezzo surface for which a component @xmath2 is seifert fibred with base orbifold of hyperbolic type .    in the course of this complicated construction we give a quite general method to construct seifert fibrations as projectivized tangent bundles of surfaces with @xmath64- singularities .",

    "we claim that @xmath471 is a weak del pezzo surface of degree @xmath56 , i.e. , that its anticanonical divisor is nef ( it is big since it clearly satisfies @xmath472 ) .",
    "this claim follows right away from the fact that , if we take homogeneous coordinates @xmath473 on @xmath474 , the system of cubics through the eight points is the pencil spanned by the two cubics @xmath475 whose proper transforms meet only ( transversally ) in the point ` at infinity ' @xmath476 .",

    "the existence of this global deformation is guaranteed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) ; in practice , some simple calculations show that this deformation is obtained by simply moving the @xmath454 points on the four lines @xmath531 but breaking the symmetry @xmath532 .",
