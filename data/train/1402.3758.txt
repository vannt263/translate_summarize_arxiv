    "brownian motion occurs as a representation of several phenomena arising in various contexts , ranging from elementary particle physics @xcite , general relativity @xcite and condensed matter @xcite . in the last decade , there has been a lot of interest in the study of diffusive processes on manifolds motivated by problems coming from biophysics @xcite .",
    "for instance , the transport processes occurring on a biological cell are interesting and complex phenomena . in particular , the motion of an integral protein through the plasma membrane has been approached from complementary points of view .",
    "the most basic of these is grounded on the smoluchowski equation for a point particle on the membrane @xcite .",
    "further approaches consider the membrane s thermal fluctuations @xcite , as well as dynamical fluctuations coupled to the stochastic motion of the protein @xcite , and finite - size effects of the protein @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that such membrane is considered as a two - dimensional curved surface because on mesoscopic scales most of its mechanical properties are captured by geometrical degrees of freedom , with the membrane bending energy being quadratic in the extrinsic curvature @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use smoluchowski s equation to study the geometric component of the diffusion process over a curved surface . in general , we focus on the following questions : what observables are appropriate to measure the displacement of a brownian particle ? and how does the curvature affect the mean - value of these observables ?",
    "by analogy with euclidean spaces it is not difficult to realize that a free particle in curved space moves from one point to another through a geodesic distance , of length @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "however , it would be difficult to measure it in an experiment because , usually , the data extracted correspond to the diffusion on a projected plane .",
    "thus , it is convenient to introduce euclidean and projected displacements as alternative observables to the geodesic displacement .",
    "the euclidean displacement @xmath5 is the vector difference between two points on the surface , and the projected euclidean displacement @xmath6 , is the projection of the euclidean displacement onto the @xmath7 plane , where @xmath8 is the projection map .",
    "these three quantities , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 reduce to the same one for flat geometries .    on one hand , the euclidean displacement has been used in @xcite to analyze the brownian dynamics in various geometries such as spheres , cylinders , periodic nodal surfaces and the so called p , d , g minimal surfaces , where , it is noteworthy to mention , that the structure of lyotropic surfactant phases like the @xmath9 ( sponge ) phase is well understood from an experimental point of view @xcite using a periodic minimal surface model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the projected displacement has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite to be the proper quantity to compare experimental data with for the lateral diffusion on fluid vesicles .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 has also been implemented as the end - to - end distance to study how polymers wrap into a curved interface @xcite .",
    "additionally , the euclidean displacement turns out to be the same quantity as the rotational displacement of rods @xcite due to the analogy between the diffusion of a single long rod and the diffusion of a single particle on the unit sphere .    as we have mentioned in @xcite , from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the brownian motion can be used to probe the geometry of the manifold in the same spirit of kac s famous question : _ can one hear the shape of a drum ?",
    "consequently , the mean - square geodesic displacement will probe the intrinsic properties of the surface whereas the mean - square euclidean displacements will inherit the extrinsic properties of the surface . here",
    ", we use the same technique used in @xcite to compute the curvature effects on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 , but now with extensive use of the weingarten - gauss equations .",
    "in particular , we provide examples to study the diffusion on the sphere , catenoid and clifford torus from both , intrinsic and extrinsic , points of view .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that for certain conditions , the expectation values , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , can be computed exactly for the sphere and the minimal surfaces for all values of time .",
    "it is shown that the diffusion on minimal surfaces measured with the observable @xmath1 corresponds to the free usual diffusion in flat geometries in agreement with the cubic minimal surfaces already studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the smoluchowski equation and the displacement observables on curved manifolds . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the operator method used to evaluate the expectation values of observables .",
    "in particular , we review the short - time regime of @xmath11 , and we study the short - time regime of @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 . in section 4 , we find exact results for @xmath14 and @xmath3 in the cases of a sphere and minimal surfaces . in addition , in section 5 , we provide illustrative examples of diffusion on sphere , catenoid and clifford torus . finally , in section 6 , we summarize our main results and give our concluding perspectives .",
    "in this section , we introduce the simplest model to study brownian motion on curved manifolds .",
    "this is a direct generalization of the smoluchowski equation on euclidean spaces @xcite , which basically consists of replacing the euclidean laplacian by the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath15 .",
    "this operator is often used to describe how a substance diffuses over a curved manifold .",
    "also we may think of it as heat diffusing on manifolds or a polymer embedded on curved interfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be used to determine the quantum propagator of a free particle on curved spaces @xcite .    for a single particle diffusion over a manifold @xmath16 with dimension @xmath17",
    ", we are interested in the probability density @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is the probability to find a diffusing particle in the volume element @xmath20 centered in @xmath21 , at time @xmath22 , when the particle started in @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "also can be interpreted as the density probability for @xmath25 non - interacting particles diffusing on an manifold @xmath26 provided that @xmath27 . ]",
    "this probability distribution @xmath28 is governed by the smoluchowski equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the diffusion coefficient , and satisfies the initial condition at time @xmath31 , @xmath32 for most geometries an exact solution for the probability distribution is not known . however ,",
    "for short times there is a formal power series solution for @xmath33 in terms of the minakshisundaram - pleijel coefficients @xcite , which depends on both @xmath21 and @xmath23 @xcite .    in order to get some insight about brownian motion we often look at mean - values of observables ( @xmath34 ) defined on the manifold such that @xmath35 is well - defined for all points @xmath23 in the manifold and for all time values ; in particular , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the area element of the surface and @xmath38 is the mean - value of an observable on the surface .",
    "note that @xmath38 depends on the initial position @xmath39 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of functions that are @xmath40 .",
    "in general , the structure of @xmath38 depends on the symmetries of the space and the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , for a free brownian particle suspended in the bulk of an homogenous fluid the mean - displacement , @xmath41 , and the mean - square displacement , @xmath42 , are rotational and traslational invariants .",
    "now , we use the geodesic or riemann distance , @xmath0 , to measure how a brownian particle moves on a curved manifold . the expectation value of @xmath43 measures how the intrinsic geometry influences brownian motion .",
    "alternatively , the displacement of the particle can also be measured using the euclidean @xmath1 and projected displacements , @xmath2 . from this point of view @xmath1",
    "is defined by @xmath44 given by @xmath45 for all points @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a parametrization of the manifold .",
    "in addition , we define @xmath2 by the projection map @xmath48 is defined as usual by @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , for a domain of @xmath16 covered with one coordinate neighborhood we use the monge parametrization @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the height function for @xmath53 .",
    "thus , in this representation we have @xmath54 .",
    "the general problem is to find the mean values for @xmath43 , @xmath1 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for any embedded manifold . in principle , these expectation values can be evaluated through the formal series solution of the diffusion equation in terms of the minakshisundaram - pleijel coefficients mentioned above .",
    "however , here we use an operator method , introduced in @xcite , inspired by the original calculations made by perrin in his seminal paper about brownian motion on spheres @xcite .",
    "the idea consists in approximating the expectation values by a taylor polynomial in the time variable .",
    "in addition , we consider that @xmath57 and @xmath58 vanish at the boundary of the manifold . using these conditions we are allowed to write @xmath59 valid for differentiable observables @xmath34 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "in addition , assuming that @xmath60 are well defined on @xmath61 , for a given @xmath16 , we define the remainder @xmath62 by @xmath63 where the terms @xmath64 are purely geometric factors .",
    "now for a given observable the difficulty lies in evaluating the terms @xmath65 .",
    "the equation ( [ formula ] ) is very useful to access the short - time regime of the brownian motion for the general manifold case , but it can also be used to find closed formulae valid for all values of time for some specific manifolds and observables .    in what follows ,",
    "we give a third order polynomial approximation for the mean values of the observables mentioned above . to this order",
    ", the taylor polynomial is an approximation of @xmath38 with an error of @xmath66 if the time @xmath22 satisfies @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a constant defined at appendix d. this later inequality also defines the short - time regime .",
    "the mean - value of @xmath43 captures intrinsic geometrical data of the manifold and says how the geometry causes a change in the standard diffusive behavior .",
    "the geometric factors for this observable can not be written , in general , in a closed form for all values of @xmath69 . however , in @xcite we have computed these factors for the first three values , @xmath70 .",
    "the result is a third order taylor polynomial , @xmath71\\left(dt\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\\nonumber,\\\\ \\label{mean - square}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients taking values at the points of the manifold .",
    "this result shows how the mean - square gd deviates from the planar expression by terms which are invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "all these terms are built with @xmath72 invariant combinations of the riemann tensor .",
    "in particular , for regular surfaces in @xmath73 , the riemann tensor components are @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the gaussian curvature .",
    "note that for developable surfaces , @xmath76 , the mean - square geodesic displacement behaves like the usual diffusion in the short - time regime @xcite .      for the brownian motion over manifolds of dimension @xmath17 ( embedded in @xmath77 ) we are interested in the expectation values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "in what follows let us recall that @xmath80 are the components of the second fundamental form and @xmath81 is the mean curvature of the hypersurface .    in this case ,",
    "also , the geometric factors can not be evaluated in a closed form for all integers @xmath69 ; we will calculate them only for @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 . using the trace of metric tensor",
    "is @xmath84 , and the weingarten - gauss equation , ( [ weingarten - gauss ] ) , we get @xmath85 . in a similar way , by straightforward calculation , we obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see appendix c ) . hence the mean - square euclidean displacement @xmath4 is given by @xmath88\\left(dt\\right)^{3}+\\cdots .",
    "% \\nonumber \\label{resultado1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , following the same procedure used just above we find the expectation value of @xmath1 , @xmath89{\\bf n}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\left.\\left[-2\\nabla^{c}\\psi\\left(k\\right ) k_{c}^{~b}-\\psi\\left(k\\right)\\nabla_{a}k^{ab}+j^{b}\\left(k\\right)k_{cb}k^{cd}\\right.\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&-&\\left.\\left.\\delta_{g}j^{b}\\left(k\\right)\\right]{\\bf e}_{b}\\right\\}\\left(dt\\right)^{3}+\\cdots , \\label{resultado2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scalar @xmath90 and vector @xmath91 are defined as @xmath92 these results , ( [ resultado1 ] ) and ( [ resultado2 ] ) , show how the euclidean mean - values deviate from its flat counterpart .",
    "this deviation is also given by terms invariant under general coordinate transformations , but now they are built in terms of the @xmath72-invariant of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath80 , i.e. , they are referred to the ambient space where the hypersurface is embedded .    as in the geodesic displacement , in a local neighborhood , the mean - square euclidean displacement reproduces the standard einstein kinematical relation .",
    "additionally , it can be noted that for non - zero short - times , @xmath93 , we still have a contribution coming form the curvature : @xmath94 . at these short - times , the normal contribution came about because in average tangent directions cancel out each other by symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , as soon as the particle reaches the boundary of the local neighborhood , the tangent components start to contribute .      in a subspace @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the projected displacement is defined by @xmath97 , for @xmath98 . in order to compute the mean - square pd , @xmath10 ,",
    "let us write @xmath99 , therefore the geometric factors satisfy @xmath100 thus , for the geometric factors with @xmath70 we have to calculate @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for @xmath82 , we have @xmath104 .",
    "using the expression for the metric in this parametrization the latter factor can be written as @xmath105 and using the normal vector @xmath106 in this parametrization we find @xmath107 the terms @xmath102 and @xmath108 are left expressed in covariant form . by straightforward calculation",
    "we find @xmath109 note that @xmath110 is the covariant derivative compatible with the metric . as in the previous cases ,",
    "the mean - square projected displacement is written as @xmath111 .",
    "for very short - times @xmath112 , the mean - square projected displacement has the usual diffusion behavior in flat geometries , but with a new diffusion coefficient @xmath113 this means that for the brownian motion observed from the projected sub - space the diffusion is reduced , since @xmath114 is smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "this modification is just a geometrical effect due to the point of view from where the brownian motion is measured .    0.5em_remark_.",
    "the result ( [ diff ] ) has been obtained by different methods for @xmath36 in @xcite and @xcite within the context of lateral diffusion of integral proteins in biomembranes . in these works",
    "they also consider membrane thermal fluctuations .",
    "for instance in @xcite , within the helfrich - canham model @xcite for fluid membranes the effective value of the diffusion coefficient is computed , ( [ diff ] ) , when thermal fluctuations are considered . in this case , the coefficients @xmath115 will be affected by thermal fluctuations ; this will be taken into consideration elsewhere .",
    "we consider now the whole series ( [ formula ] ) for the set of observables @xmath116 .",
    "for these observables , as we shall see , we are able to give exact and closed formulae valid for all time values in the cases of spheres and minimal surfaces .",
    "let us start recalling the following result .",
    "let @xmath34 be an eigenfunction of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath15 with eigenvalue @xmath117 , then the expectation value of @xmath34 is given by @xmath118 in addition , for those functions @xmath119 such that @xmath120 for each point on @xmath16 we have @xmath121 the proof of these results is given in appendix d. the spheres ( @xmath122 ) admit a parametrization that satisfies the condition in the first of these results , ( [ resa ] ) , namely , that @xmath123 . in fact , if a @xmath124dimensional manifold ( embedded in @xmath77 ) has a parametrization @xmath47 that is an eigenfunction of @xmath15 then it has to be a piece of sphere or a piece of a minimal hypersurface ( with eigenvalue @xmath125 ) .",

    "in particular , three physical observables are considered for the brownian displacement , namely , the geodesic displacement @xmath0 , the euclidean displacement , @xmath1 , and the projected displacement , @xmath2 .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that the controversy posed in @xcite about the displacement is resolved by considering that all these displacements capture information of the brownian motion .    here",

    ", it is as if the local curvature would manifest through a normal force on the particle . for the mean - square projected displacement , @xmath215 ,",
    "formulae are found in terms of the height function of the monge gauge ; in particular , we reproduce the flat diffusion behavior with the projected diffusion coefficient @xmath216 , already obtained , using different methods , in @xcite . in addition , we found surprisingly that for the diffusion on minimal surfaces the mean - square euclidean displacement exactly matches the usual diffusion corresponding to flat geometries , although the brownian motion has strong intrinsic curvature effects .",
