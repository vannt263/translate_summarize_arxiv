    "then the data are transmitted to the vaxstation-4000/60 workstation , where events are packed in a special snd format @xcite .",
    "for packed events the partial reconstruction ( see section 7 ) is performed .",
    "the reconstructed events are processed by the software 3-rd level trigger which suppresses beam background and cosmic events , decreasing the event rate by a factor of 2 .",
    "in addition it counts @xmath22 and @xmath145 events for on - line luminosity monitoring .",
    "the total time required for partial reconstruction and 3-rd level trigger decision is @xmath146 ms / event .",
    "average daq dead time is about @xmath27 .",
    "events selected by the software trigger are written on file on the local disk .",
    "after each experimental run files are automatically saved to 4 gb tapes by the data management system art @xcite .    during the run",
    "several concurrent processes collect information about detector subsystems , daq , and collider performance .",
    "real - time access to these data is provided by information management system iman @xcite .",
    "the special process monitors this information and rises alarm if hardware or software problems are detected .",
    "stability of snd subsystems is monitored using precision generator signals to test all electronics channels .",
    "this procedure takes about 20 minutes and is performed daily .",
    "large volume of data collected during experimental runs requires quick and adaptable processing .",
    "the data processing is based on cern software such as hbook @xcite , higz @xcite , paw @xcite , minuit @xcite , as well as programs developed in binp :    1 .",
    "gist @xcite provides common environment for data processing , user interface with other codes , data storage in format compatible with hbook package for further analysis using paw ; 2 .",
    "cocha @xcite provides the data input / output and storage .",
    "the data representation is based on entity  relationship model ; 3 .   event reconstruction code ; 4 .",
    "code for events visualization based on higz graphics package ; 5 .",
    "art @xcite provides transparent access to data stored on tapes and disks .",
    "processing of experimental data consists of several steps :    1 .",
    "snd subsystems are calibrated using @xmath22 and @xmath147 events ; 2 .",
    "events are reconstructed and parameters of particles are calculated ; according to these parameters the events divided into @xmath148 different physical classes ; 3 .   for each experimental run",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath145 events are counted for the integrated luminosity determination , efficiencies of snd systems are obtained ; collected information about snd and collider performance is used in the analysis , for example , to determine the beam energy more precisely ; 4 .",
    "the selected events are used for the physical analysis .",
    "event reconstruction is performed in a following sequence .",
    "first step is a search for separated clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "then the track reconstruction in drift chambers is performed .",
    "tracks are linked to the calorimeter clusters .",
    "the clusters with energy depositions of more than 20 mev not linked to tracks in dc are considered as photons . for charged tracks no requirements on energy depositions in the calorimeter",
    "are imposed .",
    "finally parameters of reconstructed particles are calculated : angles , energies , @xmath78 losses .",
    "the computer system ( fig .  [ clus ] ) used for reconstruction and analysis of experimental data includes several desktop pentium pcs running linux 2.0 and a sun enterprise 450 server under solaris 2.6 operating system .",
    "all computers are connected via 100 mb ethernet to a local network .",
    "the server provides common software and user disk space for desktop pcs , along with batch system and network services .",
    "it also runs event reconstruction code at an average speed of about 150 events per second .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the snd is based on unimod @xcite package .",
    "snd geometrical model comprises about 10000 distinct volumes .",
    "the primary generated particles are tracked through the detector media taking into account the following effects : ionization losses , multiple scattering , bremsstrahlung of electrons and positrons , compton effect , @xmath0 pair production by photons , photo - effect , unstable particles decays , interaction of stopped particles , nuclear interaction of hadrons .",
    "after that the signals produced in each detector element are simulated . to provide the adaptable account of experimental conditions : the electronics noise , signals pile up , the actual time and amplitude resolution of electronics channels .",
    "broken channels are also taken into account during reconstruction of monte carlo events .",
    "comparison of experimental and simulated distributions are shown in figs.[ksklres ] ,  [ ks2p ] .",
    "the design and performance of the snd detector operating at vepp-2 m @xmath0 collider since 1995 is described . during this time the total integrated luminosity of @xmath149  @xmath150 in the center - of - mass energy range @xmath151 gev",
    "was accumulated .",
    "new rare radiative decays @xmath152 @xcite , @xmath153 @xcite and ozi and g - parity suppressed decay @xmath154 @xcite were observed . the @xmath155 @xcite decay existence was confirmed .",
    "many other decays and hadronic production cross sections were measured with higher accuracy .",
    "more integrated luminosity is to be accumulated in the region of @xmath156 and @xmath157 mesons providing data for studies of their rare decays .",
