    "in the two last decade the following models have been accepted for a proper description of the hysteresis loop : 1 ) jiles - atherton @xcite , @xcite and szczygowski s supplement @xcite as well as chwastek s modification @xcite , 2 ) harrison @xcite , @xcite , 3 ) takcs @xcite , @xcite , 4 ) zirka - moroz @xcite . + for an older approaches to the problem of the magnetization hysteresis we refer to books by bertotti @xcite and cullity @xcite . for more recent approaches",
    "we refer to the monograph @xcite . despite the multiplicity of hysteresis models developed to date",
    ", there is no model of which self - similarity can be expressed by homogeneous functions in general sense . while the scaling of power losses is already solved by the notion of function heaving that property @xcite .",
    "since these two problems are related by the surface of hysteresis loop , it should exist an analogical representation of scaling for the magnetization processes .",
    "goal of the presented paper is to create a mathematical model which describes hysteresis and enables to express its self - similarity by the homogeneous function in general sense .",
    "this function should enable us to reproduce all magnetization processes inside a major loop which will play a role of an envelop for these processes . + it is well known that tanh(@xmath0 ) suits for model of initial magnetization function .",
    "it describes properly the saturations for both asymptotic values of the magnetic field : @xmath1 as well as behavior of the magnetization in the neighborhood of origin .",
    "the mentioned above paper @xcite starts from tanh(@xmath0 ) and describes phenomenological model which gives complete description of the magnetic hysteresis .",
    "moreover , this mapping helps to solve problems of modeling of core losses in the present of dc bias by the projection of the magnetic field just into the initial curve @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present mathematical model of hysteresis ( mmh ) in soft magnetic materials which bases on an extension of the function tanh(@xmath0 ) .",
    "goal of this paper is to derive mathematical model which properly describes the magnetization hysteresis and it enables us to perform scaling of the hysteresis loop basing on notions of self - similar system and homogeneous function in general sense @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in section [ i ]",
    "we introduce the extend tanh(@xmath0 ) function from which we derive its basic properties . in section [ ii ]",
    "we deal with self - similarity of the considered model and scaling .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ con ] .",
    "let us start from the definition of tanh(@xmath0 ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the base of the so - called natural logarithm .",
    "so , let us generalize ( [ tynh ] ) by introducing the four bases instead @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are arbitrary positive numbers .      in the first step we will derive a model of major hysteresis loop which is an envelope ot the whole family of loops of the particular considered case .",
    "let us write down the model expression for initial magnetization curve : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where , @xmath10 is magnetization corresponding to saturation expressed in tesla : @xmath7t@xmath8 $ ] , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is magnetic field , @xmath14 is a parameter of the magnetic field dimension @xmath7a m@xmath15 $ ] to be determined .",
    "where , function @xmath16 is of the following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is modeling parameter of the order @xmath19 .",
    "let the upper section of hysteresis loop and the lower one are of the following forms : @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is a model parameter depending on @xmath23 .    .",
    "let us consider for illustration the following example : @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field possesses horizontal asymptotes for @xmath26 .",
    "this means for our modeling , that the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 have to possess the same asymptotic properties .",
    "these components get equal values for @xmath29 .",
    "in fact due to uncertainty of meassured magnitudes it is possible to accept the saturation points at @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the end points of the hysteresis loop .",
    "therefore , the modeling process has to ensure that the initial function @xmath32 matches the origin and the upper end point of the loop .",
    "this effect can be controlled by the @xmath22 parameter figure [ fig.3 ] .",
    "values of @xmath23 is determined by the following relation : @xmath33 is measure of uncertainty of @xmath34 in dimension less units : @xmath35 .",
    "we present the scaling procedure on example of the both sections of a major loop .",
    "functions which have to be scaled ( [ primary]),([d]),([g ] ) consist of exponential functions and their arguments are exponents . in such a case",
    "the scaling can be performed on the basis of these functions , while the exponents can be converted by gauge transformations .",
    "let us assume that there exist real numbers @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 the following relations hold : @xmath39 then @xmath40 and @xmath41 is set of homogenous functions in general sense .",
    "@xmath42 are scaling exponents and @xmath43 is a gauge transformation parameter .",
    "we have assumed that the gauge transformation acted directly on the argument of the magnetization function : @xmath44 . whereas scaling acts directly on each base of exponential functions , for example : @xmath45 . we will show that this action can be transformed to an operator acting directly on the linear function of @xmath46 .",
    "the derived transformation ( [ scaling1 ] ) depends on the two parameters : @xmath47 and @xmath43 .",
    "each of them generates one parameter group : multiplicative group @xmath48 and additive one @xmath49 , repectively . by the definitions how do the scaling and gauge transformations act on the model equations the group of symmetry of ( [ scaling1 ] ) is the following semidirect product @xcite : @xmath50",
    "group action in @xmath51 is defined as following .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 . then : @xmath54 the group structure of @xmath51 will play important role in derivation relations between hysteresis loops .",
    "now we are ready to prove that the symmetric model of the hysteresis loop is invariant with respect to @xmath55 . by the symmetric model we mean a case characterized by the following relations between basis of ( [ primary]),([d]),([g ] ) : @xmath56 .",
    "otherwise a model is non - symmetric . for further considerations we take into account the following formula for @xmath57 : @xmath58    _",
    "theorem _ : if basis of the model ( [ primary ] ) , ( [ d ] ) and ( [ g ] ) satisfy ( [ abcd ] ) then the model of hysteresis loop is invariant with respect to scaling and gauge transformation .",
    "+ _ proof _ : let us assume an action of a group element belonging to @xmath51 . for the symmetry condition ( [ abcd ] ) the relation ( [ scaling1 ] ) takes the following form : @xmath59 where we have to remember that according to ( [ action ] ) the order of action is relevant .",
    "first the scaling has to be done before the gauge transformation . according to the assumtions just above ( [ scaling1 ] ) we are free to asume that @xmath60 then the relations ( [ scaling2 ] ) after simple evaluations take the following form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . introducing the following new variables : @xmath64 we get ( [ 12a ] ) .",
    "+ the initial magnetization curve ( [ 12c ] ) is invariant with respect to the scaling and the gauge transformations , also .",
    "the proof goes by the same way as for ( [ 12a ] ) and ( [ 12b ] ) .",
    "@xmath65      in order to make an interpretation of the derived scaling and gauge transformation we present results of their action on the hysteresis models figure [ fig.4]-figure [ fig.6 ] .",
    "figure [ fig.4 ] presents how pure gauge transformations generate a displacement of transformed loops along the horizontal axis .",
    "figure [ fig.5 ] presents compression of a loop along the vertical axis under the scaling .",
    "finally , for large value of the scaling parameter @xmath66 the transformed loops become to the preisach classical models ( figure [ fig.6 ] @xcite ) .",
    "by physical models of the hysteresis loops we try to explain origin of the magnetic materials properties . whereas in designing the magnetic materials we need analytic formulas returning real values of physical magnitudes which are relevant in this process . just the mathematical models together with an experimental data",
    "constitute powerful tool for designers @xcite,@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have derived the simple model which is promising for the mentioned above applications .",
    "the introduced group theoretical methods in analysis of the hysteresis loops will help us to divide the hysteresis loops space into orbits in @xmath51 .",
    "this division will enable us to create a minimal set of independent loops which will constitute a base in the hysteresis loops space .",
