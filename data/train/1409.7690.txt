    "since the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite special effort has been made to determine its properties .",
    "the motivation for such an effort resides on understanding the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking . at present ,",
    "several aspects of the higgs boson are to some extent well known , in particular those related with some of its expected `` standard '' decay modes , namely : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "currently , measurements of these decay modes have shown compatibility with the standard model ( sm ) expectations , although with large associated uncertainties @xcite . indeed , it is due to these large uncertainties that there is still room for nonstandard decay properties , something that has encouraged such searches at the lhc as well .",
    "searches for invisible higgs decays have been published in @xcite , while direct searches for lepton flavor violating higgs decays ( @xmath12 ) have been recently reported by the cms collaboration in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we focus on the latter , for which the cms collaboration , using the 2012 dataset taken at @xmath13  tev with an integrated luminosity of 19.7  fb@xmath14 , has found a 2.5@xmath1 excess in the @xmath15 channel , which translates into br@xmath16%",
    ".    indirect bounds on higgs lepton flavor violating decay modes arise from low - energy data .",
    "muon and tau rare decays ( e.g. @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20)induced by higgs lepton flavor breaking couplings ",
    "place upper bounds on the higgs flavor violating modes : @xmath12 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "since muon decays have the most tight limits , it is for the @xmath23 mode for which consistency with low - energy data demands a branching fraction well below the lhc reach ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "constraints on tau rare processes , being less stringent , allow larger @xmath25 and @xmath26 branching ratios @xcite , hence stimulating these searches at the lhc  .",
    "although these bounds follow from a fairly model - independent analysis ( see @xcite and references therein ) , one may also wonder what type of frameworks are capable of producing sizeable lepton flavor violating higgs decays .",
    "efforts in such direction have been done in different contexts , with pioneer works in refs .",
    "@xcite . more recenty , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the problem in the mssm , while @xcite in the r - parity violating mssm .",
    "flavor violating decays have been considered as well in the inverse seesaw model in @xcite .",
    "possible effects due to vectorlike leptons have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "extended scalar sectors involving several higgs doublets and flavor symmetries ( yukawa textures ) have been examined too @xcite . finally ,",
    "the type - iii two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) has been considered in refs .",
    "basically , the bottom line of all these analyses is that unless one deals with extra higgs doublets , lepton flavor violating higgs decays are below the lhc reach .    in this paper",
    ", we study the viability of producing the cms excess signal in the type - iii 2hdm . for simplicity , we assume flavor violation only in the lepton sector and adopt a pure phenomenological approach , that is to say all the parameters of the model are treated as free parameters subject only to phenomenological constraints .",
    "the phenomenological restrictions we consider are the following .",
    "first of all , the new degrees of freedom are constrained by electroweak precision data .",
    "thus , in our analysis we calculate the contributions to the @xmath27 parameter ( contributions to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 parameters in the 2hdm are small @xcite ) . since the couplings that induce @xmath30 induce as well tau rare processes , we consider the restrictions arising from @xmath31 ( for which we include barr - zee diagrams contributions @xcite as done in @xcite ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we also study whether our scenario can explain the @xmath34 discrepancy .",
    "in contrast to previous studies in the 2hdm , we also verify that the higgs standard properties deviate only within the allowed measured ranges @xcite . these include the following higgs decay channels : @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we check as well for theoretical constraints , namely that the scalar potential is bounded from below and contains perturbative parameters .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2hdm - description ] we discuss basic aspects of the type - iii 2hdm and introduce the formulas employed in our numerical calculation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we describe the strategy followed in our numerical analysis and present our results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a 2hdm @xcite of type - iii .",
    "contrary to other versions of the 2hdm , the type - iii 2hdm does not include any discrete symmetry that serves to distinguish between higgs doublets .",
    "therefore , both higgs doublets are allowed to couple to all fermion species .",
    "it is common to present the 2hdm in an arbitrary basis in higgs space . instead ,",
    "following @xcite , we prefer to introduce the model in the so - called higgs basis . in this basis , only one higgs doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the scalar potential of the model ( assuming cp conservation ) is given by   @xmath35 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the higgs doublets in the higgs basis , such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are cp - even neutral higgs fields , @xmath41 is a cp - odd neutral higgs field , @xmath42 is a charged higgs field and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are goldstone bosons . since we assume cp conservation , @xmath41 is the physical pseudoscalar higgs and does not mix with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the scalar mass eigenstates @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) is @xmath48 here we have introduced @xmath49 , the physical mixing angle that relates the higgs basis and the mass basis for the cp - even scalar states .",

    "finally , we will consider a specific structure for the @xmath63 matrices inspired in the _ cheng - sher ansatz _",
    "first , we normalize @xmath61 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the physical mixing angle defined by the ratio   since one can always apply rotations in higgs space , acting also on the higgs vevs , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , a specific ( physical ) definition is required @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in tau flavor violation , we choose to define @xmath77 as the relative size of the tau yukawa coupling and @xmath78 , in analogy to the usual definition of @xmath79 in the type - ii 2hdm .",

    "however , the other @xmath82 s , and in particular , @xmath83 , are free parameters . for the quark @xmath63 matrices",
    "we assume the following type - ii values @xmath84 this parameterization of the @xmath63 matrices is not the most general one but , as we will see , it leads to results in good agreement with the experimental constraints .",
    "furthermore , this ansatz can be understood as a minimal correction beyond the type - ii 2hdm , with the only departure in the @xmath0 coupling  @xcite .",
    "finally , the higgs couplings to gauge bosons are fully dictated by the gauge symmetry .",
    "one has @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the couplings to a pair of @xmath88-bosons follow the same proportionality .",
    "we now proceed to describe our phenomenological analysis .",
    "our results are based on a random scan of the parameter space , with the following ranges for the relevant input parameters : @xmath89 \\ , \\text{gev}\\ , \\qquad    m_a \\subset \\left [ 400 , 1000 \\right ] \\ , \\text{gev}\\ ,    \\\\    m_{h^\\pm } & = m_a + \\delta m \\ , \\qquad \\text{with}\\qquad    \\delta m \\subset \\left [ -5 , 5 \\right ] \\ , \\text{gev}\\ ,",

    "\\label{eq : parameter - ranges - last}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , we assume @xmath90 gev . since we are driven by phenomenological considerations , we use as input the scalar masses ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) rather than the parameters in the scalar potential .",
    "our choice of a small mass difference between the pseudoscalar and charged higgses is motivated by the reduction of the @xmath27 parameter , see @xcite for details . ] , whereas the lower limits on @xmath95 and @xmath94 ( as induced by the lower limit on @xmath93 ) are motivated by experimental constraints : smaller values of @xmath95 would be excluded by current measurements of the higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons while lower @xmath94 would lead to certain tension with flavor physics bounds ( mainly b physics , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we emphasize that the mass ranges selected for our numerical scan are quite conservative since lower values for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are allowed by lhc data , see e.g. @xcite .    after choosing input parameters three checks",
    "are performed :    * we determine @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 by means of eqs . - and only allow those parameter points where the resulting values are below @xmath100 .",
    "the exact value of this perturbativity constraint is somehow arbitrary ( see for example the discussion in @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we show that the type - iii 2hdm is capable of reproducing such signal while at the same time satisfying boundedness from below of the scalar potential , perturbativity , electroweak precision data , measured higgs standard decay modes and low - energy lepton flavor violating constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the allowed signal strength ranges for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 standard channels shrink as soon as br@xmath6% is enforced . </S>",
