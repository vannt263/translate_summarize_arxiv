    "it is well known that programmers are the laziest persons in the world .",
    "they constantly try to write less and get more .",
    "the so - called art of programming is just the way to achieve this goal .",
    "they started from programming in computer codes , found this practice boring and invented assembler , then macro assembler , then programming languages to reduce the amount of work ( but not the salary ) .",
    "the next step was to separate algorithms and data .",
    "the new principle `` algorithm @xmath0 data structure @xmath1 program '' was a great step in the same direction .",
    "now some people could work on algorithms and express those in a more or less data structure independent manner ; others programmers implement algorithms for different target data structures using different languages .",
    "this scheme worked , and worked great , but had an important drawback : for the same algorithm one has to write a new program every time a new data type is required .",
    "not only is this a boring process , it s also consuming time and money and worse , it is error - prone .",
    "so the next step was to find how to write programs in a way independent of data structures .",
    "object oriented languages , such as c++ , java and many others ( see , e.g. , [ 47 , 62 ] ) opened precisely such a way . for c++ ,",
    "templates and stl give even more opportunities .",
    "this means that for a given algorithm one can vary a data structure while keeping the program unchanged .",
    "the principle was changed to `` algorithm @xmath0 data structure family @xmath1 program . ''    but how does this approach work ? what constitutes a `` data structure family '' ?",
    "the answer is this : operations .",
    "any algorithm manipulates data by means of a set of basic operations .",
    "for example for sorting the comparison operation is required ; for scalar products and matrix multiplications , the operations of addition and multiplication are required .",
    "so to use a new data structure with the same `` generic '' program one has to implement the required operations for this data .",
    "the hope was that some standard libraries of generic programs would cover almost all programmers needs and programming would be very much like lego constructing .",
    "well , to some extent it worked , but not as much as it was expected .",
    "for different reasons .",
    "some of them are economical",
    ". why invest time and money in solving generic needs when a fast patch exists ?",
    "indeed , who would buy the next release if the current one is perfect ?",
    "another reason : there is not a great variety of possible data structures for most popular algorithms . in linear algebra",
    "one can use floating numbers , double precision numbers , infinite precision floating numbers , rational numbers , rational numbers with fix precision , hensel codes , complex numbers , integers . not much .",
    "mathematics of semirings gives a new approach to the generic programming .",
    "it parameterized algorithms .",
    "the new principle is `` parameterized algorithm @xmath0 data structure family @xmath1 program . ''",
    "what are these parameters ? they are operations ( e.g. , addition and multiplication ) .",
    "sounds great , but does it really work ?",
    "and we will show how and why .",
    "for example , we will show how the same old algorithm of linear algebra transformed by a simple redefinition of operations , can be applied to different problems in different areas .",
    "for example , the same program for solving systems of linear equations can be applied to the shortest path problem and other optimization problems ( and interval versions of the problems ) by means of simple redefinitions of the addition and multiplication operations .",
    "the algorithm was changed ( by changing parameters , i.e. operations ) , the data structure was changed , the nature of the problem was changed , but the program was not changed !",
    "there are deep mathematical reasons ( related to mathematics of semirings , idempotent and tropical mathematics ) why this approach works .",
    "we will briefly discuss them in this paper .",
    "the concept of a generic program was introduced by many authors ; for example , in [ 36 ] such programs were called ` program schemes . ' in this paper , we discuss _ universal algorithms _ implemented in the form of generic programs and their specific features . this paper is closely related to papers [ 3840 , 42 , 43 ] , in which the concept of a universal algorithm was defined and software and hardware implementation of such algorithms was discussed in connection with problems of idempotent mathematics [ 31 , 32 , 3746 , 4853 , 55 , 71 , 72 ] . in the present paper the emphasis is placed on software and hardware implementations of universal algorithms , computation with arbitrary accuracy , universal algorithms of linear algebra over semirings , and their implementations .",
    "we also present a very brief introduction to mathematics of semirings and especially to the mathematics of _ idempotent semirings _",
    "( i.e.  semirings with idempotent addition ) .",
    "mathematics over idempotent semirings is called _",
    "idempotent mathematics_. the so - called idempotent correspondence principle and idempotent superposition principle ( see [ 3843 , 4953 ] are discussed .",
    "there exists a correspondence between interesting , useful , and important constructions and results concerning the field of real ( or complex ) numbers and similar constructions dealing with various idempotent semirings .",
    "this correspondence can be formulated in the spirit of the well - known n.  bohr s _ correspondence principle _ in quantum mechanics ; in fact , the two principles are intimately connected ( see [ 3840 ] ) . in a sense , the traditional mathematics over numerical fields can be treated as a ` quantum ' theory , whereas the idempotent mathematics can be treated as a ` classical ' shadow ( or counterpart ) of the traditional one .",
    "it is important that the idempotent correspondence principle is valid for algorithms , computer programs and hardware units .    in quantum mechanics",
    "the _ superposition principle _ means that the schrdinger equation ( which is basic for the theory ) is linear .",
    "similarly in idempotent mathematics the ( idempotent ) superposition principle ( formulated by v.  p.  maslov ) means that some important and basic problems and equations that are nonlinear in the usual sense ( e.g. , the hamilton - jacobi equation , which is basic for classical mechanics and appears in many optimization problems , or the bellman equation and its versions and generalizations ) can be treated as linear over appropriate idempotent semirings , see [ 3841 , 4851 ] .",
    "note that numerical algorithms for infinite - dimensional linear problems over idempotent semirings ( e.g. , idempotent integration , integral operators and transformations , the hamilton  jacobi and generalized bellman equations ) deal with the corresponding finite - dimensional approximations .",
    "thus idempotent linear algebra is the basis of the idempotent numerical analysis and , in particular , the _ discrete optimization theory_.    b.  a.  carr [ 10 , 11 ] ( see also [ 7 , 2325 ] ) used the idempotent linear algebra to show that different optimization problems for finite graphs can be formulated in a unified manner and reduced to solving bellman equations , i.e. , systems of linear algebraic equations over idempotent semirings .",
    "he also generalized principal algorithms of computational linear algebra to the idempotent case and showed that some of these coincide with algorithms independently developed for solution of optimization problems ; for example , bellman s method of solving the shortest path problem corresponds to a version of jacobi s method for solving a system of linear equations , whereas ford s algorithm corresponds to a version of gauss ",
    "seidel s method .",
    "we briefly discuss bellman equations and the corresponding optimization problems on graphs .",
    "we stress that these well - known results can be interpreted as a manifestation of the idempotent superposition principle .",
    "we also briefly discuss interval analysis over idempotent and positive semirings .",
    "idempotent internal analysis appears in [ 45 , 46 , 69 ] .",
    "later many authors dealt with this subject , see , e.g. [ 12 , 20 , 27 , 57 , 58 , 77 ] .",
    "it is important to observe that intervals over an idempotent semiring form a new idempotent semiring .",
    "hence universal algorithms can be applied to elements of this new semiring and generate interval versions of the initial algorithms .",
    "note finally that idempotent mathematics is remarkably simpler than its traditional analog .",
    "computational algorithms are constructed on the basis of certain primitive operations .",
    "these operations manipulate data that describe `` numbers . ''",
    "these `` numbers '' are elements of a `` numerical domain , '' i.e. , a mathematical object such as the field of real numbers , the ring of integers , or an idempotent semiring of numbers ( idempotent semirings and their role in idempotent mathematics are discussed in [ 10 , 11 , 2226 , 31 , 32 , 3743 ] and below in this paper ) .    in practice elements of the numerical domains",
    "are replaced by their computer representations , i.e. , by elements of certain finite models of these domains .",
    "examples of models that can be conveniently used for computer representation of real numbers are provided by various modifications of floating point arithmetics , approximate arithmetics of rational numbers [ 44 ] , and interval arithmetics .",
    "the difference between mathematical objects ( `` ideal '' numbers ) and their finite models ( computer representations ) results in computational ( e.g. , rounding ) errors .    an algorithm is called _ universal _ if it is independent of a particular numerical domain and/or its computer representation .",
    "a typical example of a universal algorithm is the computation of the scalar product @xmath2 of two vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 by the formula @xmath5 .",
    "this algorithm ( formula ) is independent of a particular domain and its computer implementation , since the formula is well - defined for any semiring .",
    "it is clear that one algorithm can be more universal than another .",
    "for example , the simplest newton  cotes formula , the rectangular rule , provides the most universal algorithm for numerical integration ; indeed , this formula is valid even for idempotent integration ( over any idempotent semiring , see below and [ 4 , 32 , 3843 , 4851 ] . other quadrature formulas ( e.g. , combined trapezoid rule or the simpson formula ) are independent of computer arithmetics and can be used ( e.g. , in the iterative form ) for computations with arbitrary accuracy . in contrast ,",
    "algorithms based on gauss ",
    "jacobi formulas are designed for fixed accuracy computations : they include constants ( coefficients and nodes of these formulas ) defined with fixed accuracy .",
    "certainly , algorithms of this type can be made more universal by including procedures for computing the constants ; however , this results in an unjustified complication of the algorithms .",
    "computer algebra algorithms used in such systems as mathematica , maple , reduce , and others are highly universal .",
    "most of the standard algorithms used in linear algebra can be rewritten in such a way that they will be valid over any field and complete idempotent semiring ( including semirings of intervals ; see below and [ 45 , 46 , 69 ] , where an interval version of the idempotent linear algebra and the corresponding universal algorithms are discussed ) .    as a rule , iterative algorithms ( beginning with the successive approximation method ) for solving differential equations ( e.g. , methods of euler , euler ",
    "cauchy , runge ",
    "kutta , adams , a number of important versions of the difference approximation method , and the like ) , methods for calculating elementary and some special functions based on the expansion in taylor s series and continuous fractions ( pad approximations ) and others are independent of the computer representation of numbers .",
    "calculations on computers usually are based on a floating - point arithmetic with a mantissa of a fixed length ; i.e. , computations are performed with fixed accuracy . broadly speaking , with this approach only the relative rounding error",
    "is fixed , which can lead to a drastic loss of accuracy and invalid results ( e.g. , when summing series and subtracting close numbers ) . on the other hand",
    ", this approach provides rather high speed of computations .",
    "many important numerical algorithms are designed to use floating - point arithmetic ( with fixed accuracy ) and ensure the maximum computation speed",
    ". however , these algorithms are not universal .",
    "the above mentioned gauss ",
    "jacobi quadrature formulas , computation of elementary and special functions on the basis of the best polynomial or rational approximations or pad  chebyshev approximations , and some others belong to this type .",
    "such algorithms use nontrivial constants specified with fixed accuracy .",
    "recently , problems of accuracy , reliability , and authenticity of computations ( including the effect of rounding errors ) have gained much atention ; in part , this fact is related to the ever - increasing performance of computer hardware . when errors in initial data and rounding errors strongly affect the computation results , such as in ill - posed problems , analysis of stability of solutions , etc .",
    ", it is often useful to perform computations with improved and variable accuracy . in particular , the rational arithmetic , in which the rounding error is specified by the user [ 44 ] , can be used for this purpose .",
    "this arithmetic is a useful complement to the interval analysis [ 54 ] .",
    "the corresponding computational algorithms must be universal ( in the sense that they must be independent of the computer representation of numbers ) .",
    "a broad class of universal algorithms is related to the concept of a semiring .",
    "we recall here the definition of a semiring ( see , e.g. , [ 21 , 22 ] ) .",
    "consider a semiring , i.e. , a set  @xmath6 endowed with two associative operations : _ addition _",
    "@xmath7 and _ multiplication _  @xmath8 such that addition is commutative , multiplication distributes over addition from either side , @xmath9 ( resp . , @xmath10 ) is the neutral element of addition ( resp . ,",
    "multiplication ) , @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "let the semiring  @xmath6 be partially ordered by a relation  @xmath14 such that @xmath9 is the least element and the inequality @xmath15 implies that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and  @xmath18 for all @xmath19 ; in this case the semiring  @xmath6 is called _ positive _ ( see , e.g. , [ 22 ] ) .",
    "a semiring  @xmath6 is called a _ semifield _",
    "if every nonzero element is invertible .",
    "a semiring  @xmath6 is called _ idempotent _ if @xmath20 for all @xmath12 , see , e.g. , [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 2124 , 31 , 3743 , 4853 ] . in this case",
    "the addition  @xmath7 defines a _ canonical partial order _",
    "@xmath14 on the semiring  @xmath6 by the rule : @xmath21 iff @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to prove that any idempotent semiring is positive with respect to this order .",
    "note also that @xmath23 with respect to the canonical order . in the sequel",
    ", we shall assume that all idempotent semirings are ordered by the canonical partial order relation .",
    "we shall say that a positive ( e.g. , idempotent ) semiring @xmath6 is _ complete _ if it is complete as an ordered set .",
    "this means that for every subset @xmath24 there exist elements @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the most well - known and important examples of positive semirings are `` numerical '' semirings consisting of ( a subset of ) real numbers and ordered by the usual linear order @xmath27 on  @xmath28 : the semiring  @xmath29 with the usual operations @xmath30 , @xmath31 and neutral elements @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the semiring  @xmath34 with the operations @xmath35 , @xmath36 and neutral elements @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the semiring @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 if @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and the semiring  @xmath46 } = [ a , b]$ ] , where @xmath47 , with the operations @xmath48 , @xmath49 and neutral elements @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "the semiring @xmath52 is also called the _ max - plus algebra_. the semifields @xmath52 and @xmath61 are called _ tropical algebras_. the term `` tropical '' initially appeared in [ 68 ] for a discrete version of the max - plus algebra as a suggestion of ch .",
    "choffrut , see also [ 26 , 55 , 61 , 72 ] .",
    "many mathematical constructions , notions , and results over the fields of real and complex numbers have nontrivial analogs over idempotent semirings .",
    "idempotent semirings have become recently the object of investigation of new branches of mathematics , _ idempotent mathematics _ and _ tropical geometry _ , see , e.g. [ 5 , 13 , 1519 , 3528 , 31 , 32 , 3746 , 4853 , 55 , 71 , 72 ] .",

    "see , e.g. [ 3743 , 45 , 46 , 55 , 71 , 72 ] . relations between idempotent and traditional mathematics are presented in fig 1 .",
    "relations to quantum physics are discussed in detail , e.g. , in [ 38 ] .",
    "in quantum mechanics the superposition principle means that the schrdinger equation ( which is basic for the theory ) is linear .",
    "similarly in idempotent mathematics the idempotent superposition principle means that some important and basic problems and equations ( e.g. , optimization problems , the bellman equation and its versions and generalizations , the hamilton  jacobi equation ) nonlinear in the usual sense can be treated as linear over appropriate idempotent semirings ( in a general form this superposition principle was formulated by v.  p.  maslov ) , see [ 4853 ] .",
    "linearity of the hamilton - jacobi equation over @xmath335 ( and @xmath336 ) can be deduced from the usual linearity ( over @xmath310 ) of the corresponding schrdinger equation by means of the dequantization procedure described above ( in section 4 ) . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath302 of this dequantization coincides with @xmath337 , where @xmath338 is the planck constant ; so in this case @xmath338 must take imaginary values ( because @xmath339 ; see [ 38 ] for details ) .",
    "of course , this is closely related to variational principles of mechanics .",
    "the situation is similar for the differential bellman equation ( see , e.g. , [ 32 ] ) and the discrete version of the bellman equations , see section 4 above .",
    "it is well known that linear problems and equations are especially convenient for parallelization , see , e.g. , [ 73 ] .",
    "standard methods ( including the so - called block methods ) constructed in the framework of the traditional mathematics can be extended to universal algorithms over semirings ( the correspondence principle ! ) .",
    "for example , formula ( 1 ) discussed in section 4.3 leads to a simple block method for parallelization of the closure operations . other standard methods of linear algebra [ 73 ] can be used in a similar way .",

    "note that numerical algorithms for standard infinite - dimensional linear problems over idempotent semirings ( i.e. , for problems related to idempotent integration , integral operators and transformations , the hamilton - jacobi and generalized bellman equations ) deal with the corresponding finite - dimensional ( or finite ) `` linear approximations '' . nonlinear algorithms often can be approximated by linear ones .",

    "today they are used for various fields , including audio and video processing , computer simulation , and encryption .",
    "but this list can be considerably enlarged following the correspondence principle : the basic operations would be used as parameters . using the technique described in this paper",
    "( see also our references ) , standard linear algebra algorithms can be used for solving different problems in different areas .",
    "in fact , the hardware supports all operations needed for the most important idempotent semirings : plus , times , min , max .",
    "the most popular linear algebra packages [ atlas ( automatically tuned linear algebra software ) , lapack , plasma ( parallel linear algebra for scalable multicore architectures ) ] can already use gpgpu , see [ 8183 ] .",
    "we propose to make these tools more powerful by using parameterized algorithms .",
    "linear algebra over the most important numerical semirings generates solutions for many concrete problems in different areas , see , e.g. , sections 4.4 and 4.5 above and references indicated in these sections .",
    "note that to be consistent with operations we have to redefine zero ( 0 ) and unit ( 1 ) elements ( see above ) ; comparison operations must be also redefined as it is described in section  4.1 `` basic definitions . ''",
    "once the operations are redefined , then the most of basic linear algebra algorithms , including back and forward substitution , gauss elimination method , jordan elimination method and others could be rewritten for new domains and data structures .",
    "combined with the power of the new parallel hardware this approach could change pc from entertainment devices to power full instruments .",

    "recently , this type of programming technique has been dubbed generic programming ( see , e.g. , [ 6 , 62 ] ) . to help automate the generic programming , the so - called standard template library ( stl ) was developed in the framework of @xmath350 [ 62 , 70 ] .",
    "however , high - level tools , such as stl , possess both obvious advantages and some disadvantages and must be used with caution .",
    "it seems that it is natural to obtain an implementation of the correspondence principle approach to scientific calculations in the form of a powerful software system based on a collection of universal algorithms .",
    "this approach ensures a working time reduction for programmers and users because of the software unification . the arbitrary necessary accuracy and safety of numeric calculations",

    "the system has to contain the following modules :    * domain modules : * * infinite precision integers ; * * rational numbers ; * * finite precision rational numbers ( see [ 44 ] ) ; * * finite precision complex rational numbers ; * * fixed- and floating - slash rational numbers ; * * complex rational numbers ; * * arbitrary precision floating - point real numbers ; * * arbitrary precision complex numbers ; * * @xmath178-adic numbers ; * * interval numbers ; * * ring of polynomials over different rings ; * * idempotent semirings ; * * interval idempotent semirings ; * * and others . *",
    "algorithms : * * linear algebra ; * * numerical integration ; * * roots of polynomials ; * * spline interpolations and approximations ; * * rational and polynomial interpolations and approximations ; * * special functions calculation ; * * differential equations ; * * optimization and optimal control ; * * idempotent functional analysis ; * * and others .",
    "this software system may be especially useful for designers of algorithms , software engineers , students and mathematicians .",
    "note that there are some software systems oriented to calculations with idempotent semirings like @xmath52 ; see , e.g. , [ 64 ] .",
    "however these systems do not support universal algorithms .",
    "traditional interval analysis is a nontrivial and popular mathematical area , see , e.g. , [ 3 , 20 , 34 , 54 , 56 , 59 ] .",
    "an `` idempotent '' version of interval analysis ( and moreover interval analysis over positive semirings ) appeared in [ 45 , 46 , 69 ] .",
    "later appeared rather many publications on the subject , see , e.g. , [ 12 , 20 , 27 , 57 , 58 , 77 ] .",
    "interval analysis over the positive semiring @xmath351 was discussed in [ 8 ] .",
    "let a set  @xmath6 be partially ordered by a relation @xmath14 .",
    "a _ closed interval _ in  @xmath6 is a subset of the form @xmath352 = \\{\\ , x \\in s \\mid { \\underline{{\\mathbf x}}}{\\preccurlyeq}x { \\preccurlyeq}{\\overline{{\\mathbf x}}}\\ , \\}$ ] , where the elements @xmath353 are called _ lower _ and _ upper bounds _ of the interval @xmath354 .",
    "the order  @xmath14 induces a partial ordering on the set of all closed intervals in  @xmath6 : @xmath355 iff @xmath356 and @xmath357 .    a _ weak interval extension _",
    "@xmath358 of a positive semiring  @xmath6 is the set of all closed intervals in  @xmath6 endowed with operations @xmath7 and  @xmath8 defined as @xmath359 $ ] , @xmath360 $ ] and a partial order induced by the order in @xmath6 .",
    "the closure operation in @xmath358 is defined by @xmath361 $ ] .",
    "there are some other interval extensions ( including the so - called strong interval extension [ 46 ] ) but the weak extension is more convenient .",
    "the extension @xmath358 is positive ; @xmath358 is idempotent if @xmath6 is an idempotent semiring .",
    "a universal algorithm over @xmath6 can be applied to @xmath358 and we shall get an interval version of the initial algorithm . usually both the versions have the same complexity . for the discrete stationary bellman equation and",
    "the corresponding optimization problems on graphs interval analysis was examined in [ 45 , 46 ] in details .",
    "other problems of idempotent linear algebra were examined in [ 12 , 27 , 57 , 58 , 77 ] .",
    "idempotent mathematics appears to be remarkably simpler than its traditional analog .",
    "for example , in traditional interval arithmetic , multiplication of intervals is not distributive with respect to addition of intervals , whereas in idempotent interval arithmetic this distributivity is preserved .",
    "moreover , in traditional interval analysis the set of all square interval matrices of a given order does not form even a semigroup with respect to matrix multiplication : this operation is not associative since distributivity is lost in the traditional interval arithmetic . on the contrary , in the idempotent ( and positive ) case associativity",
    "is preserved . finally , in traditional interval analysis some problems of linear algebra , such as solution of a linear system of interval equations , can be very difficult ( generally speaking , they are @xmath362-hard , see [ 14 , 20 , 33 , 34 ] and references therein ) .",
    "it was noticed in [ 45 , 46 ] that in the idempotent case solving an interval linear system requires a polynomial number of operations ( similarly to the usual gauss elimination algorithm ) .",
    "two properties that make the idempotent interval arithmetic so simple are monotonicity of arithmetic operations and positivity of all elements of an idempotent semiring .",
    "usually interval estimates in idempotent mathematics are exact . in the traditional theory",
    "such estimates tend to be overly pessimistic .",
