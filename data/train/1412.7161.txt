    "<S> we need to show that , with respect to the trace distance @xmath79 , one of the closest incoherent states @xmath71 to a @xmath65 state @xmath7 is always its diagonal part @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the trace distance between a @xmath65 state @xmath7 with @xmath80 and one of its closest incoherent states @xmath71 , which is itself a @xmath65 state of the form ( [ eq : closestincoherentstatetoabdstate ] ) according to lemma 1 , is given by @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it is immediate to see that the minimum over @xmath71 is attained by @xmath82 , i.e. , by @xmath83 as claimed . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , that the equivalence between @xmath47 and @xmath41 does not extend to general two - qubit states , as can be confirmed numerically . similarly to the single - qubit case , we can derive a larger set of necessary and sufficient freezing conditions valid specifically for the @xmath43-norm of coherence . </S>",
    "<S> every two - qubit state @xmath7 can be transformed , by local unitaries , into a standard form @xcite with bloch representation @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we have then that initial states of this form , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 arbitrary , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 with @xmath92 $ ] , manifest frozen coherence as measured by @xmath47 under local bit flip channels ; however , the same does not hold for @xmath48 in general . _ * frozen coherence : n qubits . * _ our main finding can be readily generalised to a system of @xmath0 qubits with any even @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath0-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals ( @xmath93 states ) @xcite as those with density matrix of the form @xmath94 , still specified by the triple @xmath95 as in the @xmath96 case . </S>",

    "<S> this is the most general result of the present letter @xcite , and its full proof is provided in the supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , by virtue of the formal equivalence between a system of @xmath0 qubits and a single qudit with dimension @xmath99 , our results can also be interpreted as providing universal freezing conditions for all bona fide distance - based measures of coherence in a single @xmath100-dimensional system with any even @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , one may expect larger sets of freezing conditions to exist for specific coherence monotones such as the @xmath43-norm , like in the @xmath96 case ; their characterisation is outside the scope of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> we further note that no universal freezing of coherence is instead possible for @xmath93 states with odd @xmath0 , whose dynamical properties are totally analogous to those of one - qubit states .    _ * coherence versus quantum correlations . * _ the freezing conditions established here for coherence have been in fact identified in previous literature @xcite , as various measures of so - called discord - type quantum correlations were shown to freeze under the same dynamical conditions up to a threshold time @xmath101 , defined in our notation @xcite by the largest value of @xmath46 such that @xmath102 , for @xmath93 states evolving under local bit flip channels . focusing on the two - qubit case for clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we note that for @xmath65 states with @xmath103 , and for any bona fide distance @xmath29 , the distance - based measure of coherence @xmath37 , defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cddef ] ) and evaluated in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : frozenquantumcoherence ] ) , _ coincides _ with the corresponding distance - based measure of discord - type quantum correlations @xmath104 , formalised e.g.  in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the freezing of coherence might provide a deeper insight into the peculiar phenomenon of frozen quantum correlations under local flip channels ( see also @xcite ) , as the latter just reduce to coherence for @xmath105 under the conditions we identified .    </S>",
    "<S> more generally , measures of discord - type correlations @xcite may be recast as suitable measures of coherence in bipartite systems , minimised over the reference basis , with minimisation restricted to local product bases . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the minimum @xmath43-norm of coherence @xcite yields the negativity of quantumness @xcite , the minimum relative entropy of coherence @xcite yields the relative entropy of discord @xcite , and the minimum skew information @xcite yields the local quantum uncertainty @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result suggest therefore that the computational basis is the product basis which minimises coherence ( according to suitable bona fide measures ) for particular @xmath65 states undergoing local bit flip noise @xmath106 up to @xmath105 , while coherence is afterwards minimised in the eigenbasis of @xmath107 , which is the pointer basis towards which the system eventually converges due to the local decoherence @xcite ; similar conclusions can be drawn for the other @xmath108-flip channels @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally remark that , unlike more general discord - type correlations , entanglement @xcite plays no special role in the freezing phenomenon analysed in this letter , as the latter can also happen for states that remain separable during the whole evolution , e.g.  the @xmath65 states with initial triple @xmath109 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions . * </S>",
    "<S> _ we have determined exact conditions such that any bona fide distance - based measure of quantum coherence @xcite is dynamically frozen : this occurs for an even number of qubits , initialised in a particular class of states with maximally mixed marginals , and undergoing local independent and identical nondissipative flip channels ( fig .  [ frolla ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that there is no general agreement on freezing conditions between specific coherence monotones when considering either the one - qubit case or more general @xmath0-qubit initial states . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the prominent role played by the aforementioned universal freezing conditions in ensuring a durable physical exploitation of coherence , regardless of how it is quantified , for applications such as quantum metrology @xcite and nanoscale thermodynamics @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to explore practical realisations of such dynamical conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> complex systems are inevitably subject to noise , hence it is natural and technologically crucial to question under what conditions the quantum resources that we can extract from them are not deteriorated during open evolutions @xcite . in addressing this problem by focusing on coherence , </S>",
    "<S> we have also revealed an intrinsic physical explanation for the freezing of discord - type correlations @xcite , by exposing and exploiting the intimate link between these two nonclassical signatures . </S>",
    "<S> providing unified quantitative resource - theory frameworks for coherence , entanglement , and other quantum correlations is certainly a task worthy of further investigation @xcite .    _ </S>",
