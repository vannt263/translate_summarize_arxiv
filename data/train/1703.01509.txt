    "the objective of the paper is the development of methods for the co - design of jump - rules and state - feedback controllers for linear impulsive systems , a general class of hybrid systems that encompasses switched and sampled - data systems as particular instances @xcite .",
    "the approaches are based on a so - called _ min - jumping rule _ , which is analogous to the min - switching rule considered in @xcite in the context of switched systems .",
    "the underlying idea of this switching rule is to consider multiple lyapunov functions and select the mode that minimizes the value of the corresponding lyapunov function at any time .",
    "another approach @xcite is based on the use of a common lyapunov function and the switching rule is chosen such that the derivative of the lyapunov function is minimum at any time .",
    "although slightly different , these approaches share the underlying assumption that the state / output of the system is continuously measured , which may be impractical from an implementation point of view or may lead to undesired chattering . a solution to the chattering problem that may arise in @xcite",
    "is proposed in @xcite where a refractory period for the switching signal is imposed in the form of a minimum dwell - time constraint .",
    "an alternative method where state measurements are made at certain time instants and used to update the control input accordingly is proposed here .",
    "such a scenario occurs , for instance , in networked control systems where actuation decisions are made upon reception of measurements from sensors , which may happen aperiodically due to the presence of sampling , jitter , delays and packet loss @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is twofold : it rules out the chattering phenomenon of the continuous - time methods and is realistic from an implementation viewpoint since no continuous measurement is assumed .",
    "it is assumed here that the measurements from sensors arrive at discrete time instants which are assumed to satisfy a mild range dwell - time condition @xcite .",
    "hence , both periodic and aperiodic measurements are considered and can be easily defined in a way to incorporate jitter , small delays and self / event - triggered sampling mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the proposed approach is then applied to impulsive systems and switched - impulsive systems which can be used to model networked control systems subject to delays and communication outages , systems controlled by multiple controllers or systems with limited actuation resources @xcite . to the author s knowledge , this is the first time that convex conditions for the co - design of asynchronous switching / jumping rules and a sampled - data state - feedback controller are obtained for impulsive and switched impulsive systems .",
    "sufficient stabilization conditions are first stated as discrete - time lyapunov - metzler conditions , which are then reformulated into equivalent clock - dependent conditions @xcite .",
    "these conditions have been shown to be more suitable for computational purposes and to be easily generalizable to uncertain systems and to performance characterization such the @xmath0-performance ; see e.g ; @xcite .",
    "the main drawback is that these conditions are infinite - dimensional and need to be relaxed using , for instance , methods based on sum of squares @xcite",
