    "the swimming phenomenon has been the subject of interest for many researchers in various areas of natural sciences for a long time , aimed primarily at understanding biomechanics of swimming locomotion of biological organisms , see gray @xcite(1932 ) , gray and hancock @xcite ( 1951 ) , taylor @xcite ( 1951 ) , @xcite ( 1952 ) , wu @xcite ( 1971 ) , lighthill @xcite ( 1975 ) , and others .",
    "this research resulted in the derivation of a number of mathematical models for swimming motion in the ( whole ) @xmath1- or @xmath2-spaces with the swimmer to be used as the reference frame , see , e.g. , childress @xcite ( 1981 ) and the references therein .",
    "in particular , based on the size of reynolds number , it was suggested ( for the purpose of simplification ) to divide swimming models into three groups : microswimmers ( such as flagella , spermatozoa , etc . ) with `` insignificant '' inertia ; `` regular '' swimmers ( fish , dolphins , humans , etc . ) , whose motion takes into account both viscosity of fluid and inertia ; and euler s swimmers , in which case viscosity is to be ` neglected'.    it also appears that the following two , in fact , mutually excluding approaches were distinguished to model the swimming phenomenon ( see , e.g. , childress , @xcite ( 1981 ) ) .",
    "one , which we can call the `` _ shape - transformation approach _ '' , exploits the idea that the swimmer s shape transformations during the actual swimming process can be viewed as a set - valued map in time ( see the seminal paper by shapere and wilczeck @xcite ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "the respective models describe the swimmer s position in a fluid via the aforementioned maps , see , e.g. , @xcite ( 1981 ) , @xcite ( 2008 ) , @xcite ( 2011 ) and the references therein .",
    "typically , such models consider these maps as _ a priori prescribed _ , in which case",
    "the question whether the respective maps are admissible , i.e. , compatible with the principle of self - propulsion of swimming locomotion or not , remains unanswered .",
    "in other words , one can not guarantee that the model at hand describes the respective motion as a self - propulsive , i.e. , swimming process . to ensure the positive answer to this question one needs to be able to answer the question whether the a priori prescribed body changes of swimmer s shape can indeed be a result of actions of its internal forces under unknown in advance interaction with the surrounding medium .    the other modeling approach ( we will call it the _ `` swimmer s internal forces approach '' or sif approach _ ) assumes that the available internal swimmer s forces are explicitly described in the model equations and , therefore , they determine the resulting swimming motion .",
    "in particular , these forces will define the respective swimmer s shape transformations in time as a result of an unknown - in - advance interaction of swimmer s body with the surrounding medium under the action of the aforementioned forces . for this approach",
    ", we refer to peskin @xcite ( 1975 ) , fauci and peskin @xcite ( 1988 ) , fauci @xcite ( 1993 ) , peskin and mcqueen @xcite ( 1994 ) , tytell , fauci et al @xcite ( 2010 ) , khapalov @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the original idea of peskin s approach is to view a `` narrow '' swimmer as an immaterial `` immersed boundary '' . within this approach",
    "the swimming motion is defined at each moment of time by the explicit swimmer s internal forces . following the ideas of peskin s approach , khapalov introduced the _ immersed body sif modeling approach _ in which the bodies of `` small '' flexible swimmers are assumed to be identified with the fluid within their shapes , see @xcite-@xcite ( 2005 - 2014 ) .",
    "indeed , in the framework of peskin s method the swimmer is modeled as an immaterial curve , identified with the fluid , further discretized for computational purposes on some grid as a collection of finitely many `` cells '' , which in turn can be viewed as an immerse body , see figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the idea here is to try , making use of mathematical simplifications of such approach , to focus on the issue of macro dynamics of a swimmer .",
    "the simplifications ( they seem to us to be legitimate within the framework of our interest ) include the reduction of the number of model equations and avoiding the analysis of micro level interaction between a `` solid '' swimmer s body surface and fluid .",
    "it should be noted along these lines that in typical swimming models dealing with `` solid '' swimmers , the latter are modeled as `` traveling holes '' in system s space domain , that is , the aforementioned `` micro level '' surface interaction is not in the picture as well .    in the above - cited works by khapalov @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the immerse body sif approach was applied to the nonstationary stokes equations in 2-@xmath0 and 3-@xmath0 dimensions with the goal to investigate the well - posedness of respective models and their controllability properties . in this paper",
    "our goal is to extend these results with respect to well - posedness to the case of navier - stokes equations in both the 2-@xmath0 and 3-@xmath0 incompressible fluids . to our knowledge",
    ", there were no previous publications investigating this issue within the sif approach .",
