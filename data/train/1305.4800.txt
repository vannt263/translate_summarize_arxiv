    "numerous works have recently been devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of josephson qubit circuits ( see , e.g. , reviews ref .  ) .",
    "amplitude spectroscopy @xcite obtains information about these circuits as a function of the driving amplitude and control parameters determining the distance between levels .",
    "this technique can be applied to quantum systems with crossing energy levels where transitions can be realized by changing the external parameters . in this situation",
    ", the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field can be several orders of magnitude lower than the distance between levels , thus the system driven at the field period evolves mostly adiabatically , with the exception of the relatively small time intervals when energy levels approach each other and landau - zener tunneling becomes possible between them @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain an interference pattern of populations depending on the field amplitude and the distance between levels @xcite ( see ref .   for a review ) .",

    "the dynamics of a qubit is not determined by the field produced by a pulse generator but by the acting field , which undergoes significant changes in a waveguide . in recent works ref .",
    "the control of qubit populations and signal diagnostics were carried out by mixing two large - amplitude rf - pulses with different frequencies at a fixed the phase difference . in particular ,",
    "the ability to manipulate pulse shapes can be used to control the time a qubit spends near an avoid crossing .",
    "this approach in combination with landau - zener - steckelberg interference , can control the interference , by changing the parameters of a probing signal @xcite .",
    "since rabi dynamics and qubit populations depend on the form of the driving signal , the qubit could also be used for calibrating ultrashort ( nanosecond ) pulses .",
    "for example , phase - sensitive effects , actively used in optics @xcite and plasma physics @xcite , can control system populations and calibrate ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "biharmonic drives have also been extensively studied in the context of controlling transport phenomena of either small particles or magnetic flux quanta @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to investigate how to control transitions between qubit states and the interference pattern of populations by changing the form of the applied driving field . a perturbation resonant theory @xcite ( rabi generalized approximation ) and a quasi - energy approach @xcite are used to study the controlled dynamics of qubits subject to driving .",
    "special attention is paid here to the phase dependence of the qubit response to a biharmonic field , which represents the superposition of two signals with a phase shift between them .",

    "<S> we investigate the amplitude and phase effects of qubit dynamics and excited - state population under the influence of a biharmonic control field . it is demonstrated that the biharmonic driving field can have a significant effect on the behavior of quasi - energy level crossing as well as on multi - photon transitions . also , the interference pattern for the populations of qubit excited states is sensitive to the signal parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of using these effects for manipulating qubit states and calibrating nanosecond pulses . </S>"
