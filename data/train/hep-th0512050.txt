    "rather , this paper determines what we can expect _ solely _ on the basis of the string landscape being a large , multidimensional potential . in doing",
    "so we have two aims .",
    "firstly , to the extent that the properties of the string landscape are a function solely of its dimensionality and other simple parameters , the analysis presented here elucidates its properties . secondly ,",
    "if the actual string landscape does not match the conclusions we reach here , we will learn that its properties follow from the structure of string theory itself , and not just large-@xmath0 statistics .    a program for computing the number of vacua in the string landscape",
    "has been implemented @xcite . however , in keeping with our interest in what follows from the large dimensionality of the landscape , our starting point will be an elegant argument championed by susskind @xcite , which explains why we expect a landscape to possess a huge number of extrema , and a smaller but still vast number of minima .",
    "we focus on three specific problems  the number of minima ( relative to the number of extrema ) that survive when cross - couplings between the individual fields are turned on , the average separation between extrema in a random landscape , and the inflationary trajectories that exist within the landscape .",
    "calculations with a similar flavor to those presented here can be found in arkani - hamed _",
    "_ s work on the `` friendly landscape '' @xcite , extended by distler and varadarajan to cross - coupled fields through the use of random polynomials and modular forms @xcite .",
    "the latter paper , in particular , examines a very similar problem to ours , using algebro - differential techniques to analyze the minima of the landscape .",
    "here , we focus upon the random matrices arising from the hessians which characterize the extrema of a random cross - coupled potential .",
    "we find that the cross - coupling terms must be suppressed relative to the self - interaction terms by @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the dimensionality of the landscape , or the number of minima is effectively reduced to zero .",
    "this coincides ( up to a numerical factor ) with the separation of scales needed to ensure that newton s constant is safe from radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "we also look at higher order corrections , showing that these can induce an additional @xmath2 term in this result .",
    "further , random matrix theory models of the landscape are considered by @xcite , in the context of quantum cosmology .",
    "in addition to estimating the number of vacua permitted by a random multifield potential , we also consider the very large number of inflationary trajectories associated with a random landscape .",
    "slow roll inflation will typically occur near a saddle , rather than at a minimum  and saddles are much more numerous than minima or maxima .",
    "many inflationary models have been built inside of string theory ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a number of these make explicit reference to the properties of the landscape . in particular , folded inflation @xcite and chained inflation @xcite , and rely on the presumed combinatorics of the landscape to concatenate several successive periods of inflation and we will see that a _ generic _",

    ", tegmark has looked closely at the distribution of observable parameters associated with random inflationary models @xcite .",
    "finally , the problem tackled here has obvious analogues in condensed matter system  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we review the expected number of extrema in a random landscape , and the proportion of these extrema which are actually minima . we then consider the impact of cross - couplings on the distribution of minima in two limits .",
    "when the cross - couplings are of the same order as the self - couplings , we use random matrix theory to show that the number of minima is essentially zero  or one , if we have _ a priori _ knowledge that the potential is bounded below .",
    "conversely , for small cross - couplings we show that if the typical mass - scale in the landscape , @xmath3 , satisfies @xmath4 the minima are safe . in section 3 we review the inflationary dynamics and perturbation spectra of multifield models , and their implications for the landscape .",
    "we show that if these potentials are bounded in field - space , a weak version of the @xmath5 problem appears even without reference to supersymmetry breaking , and that viable models of inflation in a landscape are likely to involve either an inflaton rolling toward a saddle ( hybrid inflation ) or several scalar fields working cooperatively to drive an inflationary epoch ( assisted inflation ) . in section 4",
    "we compute the average distance between extrema in the landscape and show that this is typically larger than @xmath6 , showing even though the landscape can contain a vast number of minima , they are typically well separated .",
    "susskind has given a simple geometrical argument that the number of minima in the string landscape is most likely very large @xcite .",
    "consider a landscape with @xmath0 scalar degrees of freedom , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the functional form @xmath9 where the @xmath10 each have at least one extremum .",
    "since there are no cross terms , any combination of @xmath7 that extremizes all the @xmath10 yields an extremum of @xmath11 . if each @xmath10 has @xmath12 extrema , the total number of extrema of @xmath11 is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the geometric mean of the @xmath12 .",
    "continuity requires that every second extremum of @xmath10 is a minimum , so the landscape has @xmath15 vacua . in the string landscape , @xmath0 is expected to be on the order of a few hundred .",
    "provided @xmath14 is not too close to unity , @xmath16 , tempting one to use anthropic arguments to `` explain '' why the cosmological constant , @xmath17 , is apparently fine - tuned to this level of precision .",
    "moreover , when @xmath16 , the possible values of @xmath17 are effectively continuous ( assuming they are not massively degenerate ) , yielding a _ discretuum _ of values for @xmath17 . does scan through some range of values , there is no guarantee that this range includes zero @xcite . ] in this case minima are so closely spaced that no conceivable measurement of @xmath17 alone could uniquely determine which vacuum corresponded to our universe , even if we were able to exhaustively catalog all the minima in the landscape .",
    "recalling elementary multivariable calculus , @xmath18 possesses an extremum if all first derivatives vanish at a point .",
    "extrema are classified via the hessian , @xmath19 if @xmath20 only has positive ( negative ) eigenvalues , we have a local minimum ( maximum ) , whereas if @xmath20 has mixed positive and negative eigenvalues , we have a saddle point .",

    "the theory of random matrices is rich and beautiful , with applications all over physics @xcite .",
    "the simplest case , where the landscape is defined by equation  ( [ landscape1 ] ) , is trivial : @xmath20 is diagonal , and the eigenvalues are the second derivatives of the @xmath10 at a given extremum . these are equally likely to be negative or positive , so we have @xmath25 equally weighted permutations of the signs of the eigenvalues .",
    "only one of these configurations corresponds to a minimum , and almost any randomly selected extremum will be a saddle .",
    "thus , of the @xmath26 extrema , @xmath27 are minima , recovering the result of the previous subsection .    from a physical perspective",
    ", however , there is no reason to expect that the cross - terms in the landscape vanish , so let us add simple cross - couplings .",
    "near an extremum , these take the form @xmath28 we can now consider the opposite , and equally unphysical limit , where all the terms in @xmath20 are of equal size , and drawn from identical , independent distributions . in this case , we need to turn to a more sophisticated analysis .",

    "consequently , the likelihood of a large fluctuation putting all the eigenvalues on the same side of zero is vastly smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "a great deal is known about the properties of fluctuations away from the semi - circle law ( e.g. @xcite ) and we can estimate the likelihood of all the eigenvalues having the same sign .",

    "the measured constant differs slightly from @xmath60 , although given the simplicity of our approximation the agreement is perhaps surprisingly good .",
    "tracy and widom have proved very general results about the expected size of the largest eigenvalue , and the likelihood of fluctuations away from the expected maximal value @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of finding that the largest eigenvalue is zero is of course equivalent to the probability that all the eigenvalues have the same sign . in principal",
    ", one could extract an exact formula for this ratio at large @xmath0 from @xcite , but since we are working with a very simple model , a more sophisticated calculation is probably not justified .",
    "the strong suppression of large fluctuations away from the semi - circle law can be understood physically .",
    "the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are physically equivalent to the distribution of charged beads along an infinite wire with a quadratic potential centered on the origin , and logarithmic interaction potentials between the beads .",
    "the overall potential causes the beads to cluster near the origin , but their mutual repulsion forces them to separate @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of a fluctuation that places all the beads on the same side of the origin is very small , and vastly less than the @xmath39 likelihood that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix will all have the same sign .",
    "the number of extrema in the landscape was calculated after assuming that the fields are uncoupled , so that the number of extrema encountered as one adjusts a single field does not depend on the value of the other fields .",
    "we are now tacitly assuming that even in a cross - coupled landscape the number of extrema depends only exponentially on @xmath0 .",
    "the precise form of this dependence does not matter , since the chance of any given extremum being a minimum ( or maximum ) now decays super - exponentially with increasing @xmath0 . in this limit , instead of having @xmath61 vacua , the potential has none  or perhaps just one , if it is bounded below . in a landscape with cross - couplings of the same order as the diagonal terms",
    ", the field point will never be prevented from rolling and will naturally flow to the global minimum ( assuming that one exists ) .",
    "while such a potential yields a universe that is now in a unique and stable vacuum , one can not use combinatorial arguments to dilute the cosmological constant problem .      in reality , it is reasonable to assume that the landscape can be decomposed into two pieces  a diagonal part corresponding to the @xmath62 which are of order unity , and much smaller cross - terms of order @xmath63 .",
    "physically , the diagonal terms are self - interactions and the cross terms come from interactions between the individual fields .",
    "if the characteristic mass - scale of the tree level @xmath64 is @xmath3 then @xmath63 has dimensions of mass - squared , and we expect @xmath65 , in the absence of special symmetries and assuming that the cross - terms are induced by gravitational interactions .",
    "if @xmath66 ( that is , the cross - couplings arise from operators of the same order as those that produce the diagonal terms ) , we have established that almost any extremum will be a saddle .",
    "we now determine how large the cross coupling terms can be without destroying the expectation that @xmath67 of the extrema are actually minima .",

    "interestingly , arkani - hamed _ et al .",
    "_ derived essentially the same relationship between the planck scale and the scale of the landscape by requiring that newton s constant be protected from radiative corrections : they find an extra numerical factor arising from the constant term in the einstein - hilbert action , which we have effectively absorbed into @xmath6 .    at this point , however , we have not examined the convergence of the series in equation  ( [ perturb1 ] ) .",

    "this result was obtained using an explicit ansatz for the eigenvalue spacing of @xmath74 . given a full understanding of this spacing , which would be possible in a detailed physical model , it would then be worth analyzing these logarithmic corrections carefully .",
    "however , given the generic potentials we are studying here we will not pursue this issue further , beyond noting that the bounds on @xmath63 can easily be tighter than @xmath92 .",
    "the third term of ( [ perturb1 ] ) is benign , since the summation resembles @xmath93 , but the extra factor of @xmath0 is deleted by the @xmath78 term in the numerator , and we do not see a logarithmic divergence .",
    "the final term is again safe , since its numerator takes on random signs and its contributions add incoherently .",
    "moreover , with this assumption we see that the above series is at least asymptotically convergent .",
    "if typical entries in @xmath71 have magnitude @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , then this series can be safely truncated . in figure",
    "[ fig : perturb ] we demonstrate these results heuristically , showing how preserving the sign of the lowest eigenvalue depends on our choice of @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that even a mild separation of scales ensures that the off - diagonal terms in the hessian matrix are small enough to preserve the intuition that a landscape indeed has multiple minima .",
    "we also see that the separation of scales needed for the protection of newton s constant @xcite picks up an additional logarithmic term via this calculation . for @xmath96",
    "this is still less than a full order of magnitude , but it is tempting to speculate about the connection between this heuristic argument and the separation between the gut scale and the planck scale .",
    "the calculation here implies an upper bound , but can not be taken to imply that this bound is saturated in practice . in particular , there are well - established examples ( e.g. shift symmetries for axions and other goldstone bosons , and locality in the case of fields associated with cycles that are well separated in the compact directions ) where the @xmath63 terms are very strongly suppressed",
    ".    the next level of sophistication , which we will not pursue here , would be to analyze a landscape where most of the fields were only weakly coupled to each other , but with each field coupled to several others at lowest order .",
    "this yields a band - diagonal hessian matrix .",
    "as the width of the band increased one would move from the @xmath39 diagonal limit to the @xmath97 limit found for the fully symmetric case .",
    "given an estimate of the width of this band one could then deploy more sophisticated random matrix techniques to derive the eigenvalue distribution for the hessian .",

    "many discussions of the landscape focus upon the number of minima , since these are the points that are associated with the discrete vacua .",
    "given a vast number of minima , we can at least assume the _ existence _ of vacua where the height of the landscape will match the observed value of cosmological constant , along with any other fundamental parameters that are effectively `` environmental . ''",
    "there is no guarantee that these special minima are attractors , but provided they have a non - zero basin of attraction in the initial conditions space , we `` explain '' the observed value of @xmath17 with a very mild amount of anthropic reasoning . from a cosmological perspective , however , we care about both the vacuum itself and how the universe arrives there .",
    "that is , what is the trajectory through the landscape that leads to this final ( meta)-stable vacuum from a presumably random initial configuration ?",
    "in particular , does this trajectory include a region where the height of the landscape changes slowly , and we see a sufficiently long period of inflation ? in this case , the combinatorial arguments advanced to `` solve '' the cosmological constant problem may also address the tunings present in most models of inflation .",
    "inflation in a landscape ( or with any set of scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms , for that matter ) can occur in two different ways :    * the field point is near a minimum with @xmath101 , and the fields do not possess sufficient kinetic energy to climb over the barrier . *",

    "the first possibility is realized today if the dark energy is generated by an actual cosmological constant , rather than some quintessence - style scenario where @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "the second possibility is the prototype for primordial inflation , since if the field point is trapped in a local minimum it can only escape by tunneling , resurrecting the bubble problem first recognized in the original model of inflation .",

    "consequently , by counting the extrema ( as opposed to just the minima ) in the landscape , we can estimate the number of distinct inflationary trajectories that can be supported within it .    in order to produce a phenomenologically acceptable period of inflation ,",
    "the second derivatives of the potential must be small , at least in the downhill directions .",
    "this is ensures that slow roll applies not just at a point in fieldspace , but over some finite range , so that the inflationary epoch is not transient .",

    "this effectively embeds inflationary models with a single scalar field and trans - planckian vev within the landscape .",
    "however , in order to see this , we must transform to a new basis in which the only downhill degree of freedom runs from one corner of the landscape to another .",
    "if we view the landscape as a purely random potential , assisted inflation does not appear natural ( the position taken in @xcite ) , since it requires a correlation between the masses of a large fraction of the fields , and this reduces the effective dimensionality of the landscape , undermining the strength of combinatorial arguments .",

    "conversely , the landscape itself is ( by assumption ) a cube with volume @xmath152 taking the ratio of these two quantities , the odds of randomly choosing two points in the landscape and finding that they are separated by a distance @xmath153 is @xmath154 .",
    "this quantity rapidly approaches zero as @xmath0 becomes large for fixed @xmath135 , thanks to the familiar result that the n - cube is vastly larger than the n - sphere .",
    "quantitatively @xmath155^{n/2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] moreover , this is actually an _ overestimate _ , since it assumes the whole @xmath0-sphere fits inside the @xmath0-cube .",
    "recalling that we have @xmath15 minima , we can therefore form @xmath156 distinct pairs of minima . in this case , the expected number of pairs of minima whose separations are less than the characteristic scale of the landscape , @xmath135 is @xmath157^{n/2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] thus we can quickly deduce : @xmath158 if the inequality in ( [ flatineq ] ) is satisfied , all the vacua in the landscape will be separated by a distance greater than @xmath135 .",
    "if we had looked for genuinely close points ( since @xmath135 is a substantial distance within the the landscape ) the constraint would have been correspondingly tighter .",
    "numerically , if @xmath159 , @xmath160 will give a dense set of minima , whereas with @xmath161 would need @xmath162 .",
    "consequently , it seems likely that we can regard all the extrema as being well separated from one another , and thus forming a very sparse set within the landscape .",
    "we can also ask about the likely separation between inflationary saddles . in general",
    ", there @xmath26 saddles in the landscape , but if we want to concatenate two periods of inflation without a significant interruption , we want to end one trajectory and find that another saddle is within a distance @xmath20 inside field space . since we have argued that the energy scale of the landscape is necessarily reduced by a factor of @xmath163 relative to the planck scale , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 . inserting these values into equation  ( [ pdelta ] )",
    "@xmath166^{n/2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] and the likelihood of connecting two inflationary saddles _ by chance",
    "_ drops super - exponentially as @xmath0 increases .",
    "even though the number of extrema grows exponentially with @xmath0 , the ratio volumes between the hypercube and hypersphere grows super - exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the separation of scales needed to protect the minima grows with @xmath0 , and since this is inversely proportional to the scale of inflation , the likelihood of finding two adjacent inflationary trajectories is further suppressed .",
    "this conclusion applies to both `` chained inflation '' @xcite and `` folded inflation '' @xcite .",
    "since we are looking at a purely random potential , it is possible that both of these models might be realized in the context of the actual string landscape . on the other hand ,",
    "multistage models of the form discussed in @xcite are safe , since the inflationary stages are well separated .",
    "however , they are not rendered natural _ simply _ by the large number of extrema that the landscape contains , but must be justified by showing that in the actual string landscape there are well - defined subspaces where the density of extrema is much higher than in the rest of the volume .",
    "this problem is particularly acute for chained inflation , as the successive tunneling events it needs will be strongly suppressed if the minima are well separated as the barrier between them is then likely to be high .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to explore what follows _ solely _ from the large dimensionality of the string landscape , rather than from its detailed mathematical properties .",
    "as was stressed earlier , the results here apply to general `` random '' potentials , but it is entirely possible that the actual distribution of minima in the string landscape is sufficiently non - random to thwart the arguments made in this paper .",
    "however , these results will let us distinguish between intrinsically stringy effects , and phenomena expected to arise in any physical model with a large number of scalar fields .",
    "even at this point , we can identify a number of ways in which string theory may yield a distribution of vacua which differs from those posited by our analysis .",
    "for instance , @xcite examines no - scale models where the potential is non - negative and the hessian matrices positive semi - definite .",
    "there are flat directions at tree - level but no tachyons , leading to a set of hessian matrices that differs sharply from those considered here .",
    "after susy breaking , the extrema seen in these models @xcite still have hessian matrices whose detailed structure ensures that the fraction of extrema which are actually minima exceeds @xmath39 . finally , we can seek out sub - regions within the landscape which contain an extra scale @xmath167 , so the separation of vacua in field space is controlled by @xmath167 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , we might well find that variants of the arguments developed here still apply _ within _ the subspaces of the landscape in which the vacua are `` over dense '' or otherwise atypical .",
    "interestingly , while the number of minima produced by the simplest model  a large set of non - interacting fields  can be estimated trivially , turning on cross - coupings quickly changes the picture .",
    "in particular , if the cross terms between the fields have the same size as the diagonal quadratic terms , we can use random matrix theory to show that almost all extrema of the landscape are saddle points , and that there will be few or even no minima . in the limit where the cross - terms between the fields are naturally suppressed relative to the self - interaction terms",
    ", we can quantify the amount of suppression required to ensure that the minima are not removed by these interactions .",
    "finally , the distances between minima in the landscape are typically substantial , even though the _ number _ of minima grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the landscape .",
    "this has immediate consequences for models such as chained inflation @xcite or folded inflation @xcite , which concatenate several separate periods of inflation .",
    "these models are not ruled out , but the necessary combinatorics can not be provided simply by an appeal to the dimensionality of the landscape .    we see several possible extensions of the approaches outlined in this paper , and feel that the appearance of random matrix theory in this context is particularly suggestive . in particular , one of the authors [ re ] and liam mcallister are currently using random matrix techniques to analyse the mass - spectrum found in models of n - flation @xcite .",
    "the extent to which the properties of the actual string landscape matches the expectations derived solely from the large - n considerations explored here remains an open question .",
    "however , we have shown the dimensionality of the landscape alone is sufficient to draw conclusions about the likely set of extrema that exist within it .",
