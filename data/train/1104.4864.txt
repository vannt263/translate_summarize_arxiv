    "the sorting ( and , so , the naming ) would have been slightly different using other bandpasses to define colors . in general , however , the smaller the ask class the redder the full spectrum , and we often use the terms red and blue referring to low and high ask numbers , respectively . the ask classification of all the galaxies with spectra in sdss / dr7 is publicly available . in this paper",

    "the distributions of hubble types given an ask class are very skewed ; they present long tails that go to the late morphological types for the red galaxies , and to the early morphological types for the blue spectroscopic classes .",
    "the scatter is not produced by problems in the classification , and it is not reduced when particular subsets are considered  low and high galaxy masses , low and high density environments , barred and non - barred galaxies , face - on galaxies , small and large galaxies , or when a volume limited sample is considered .    the upper left corner of the scatter plot is truly devoid of targets , i.e. , there is a remarkable lack of sd , sdm , i m and sm galaxies with red spectra .",
    "these morphological types are associated with low mass galaxies , and we interpret this lack as an indication that , for these particular galaxies , the time scale for the morphological changes is shorter than that for the spectral changes . when these very late type galaxies evolve , their hubble type must become earlier before they become redder . on the contrary , there are plenty of red sa  sc galaxies , suggesting that a galaxy can change spectrum while maintaining a hubble type , provided the galaxy is massive enough .",
    "we have found that 68% of the red galaxies ( ask  0 , 2 and 3 ) in the catalog used for reference @xcite are spirals rather then ellipticals .",
    "even though red spectra are not associated with ellipticals , most ellipticals do have red spectra : 97% of the ellipticals in @xcite belong to ask  0 , 2 or 3 whereas only 3% of them are blue .",
    "according to their colors , most local galaxies can be split into red galaxies ( red sequence ) and blue galaxies ( blue cloud ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the color gap is not sharp so that in between the two extremes one finds galaxies with intermediate colors on the so - called green valley .",
    "these are thought to be transition galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ask classification managed to isolate the green  valley into a single class ask  5 @xcite .",
    "we find most of ask  5 galaxies being spiral (   [ sect_nair_abra ] ) .",
    "since the galaxies in the blue cloud are spiral as well , the green valley galaxies seem to be in transit from the blue cloud to the red sequence , with the transition involving no major morphological change .",
    "the existence of red spirals mentioned above means that the red sequence is populated by both spheroids and disks .",
    "if the galaxies in the green valley were rejuvenated red galaxies with recent star - formation activity , they should present the mixture of e and sp types characteristic of the red sequence , which is not observed .",
    "the fact that the blue cloud preferentially contains late morphological types but the red sequence is not dominated by early types seems to be well established in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we explore the dependence of the scatter plot hubble type vs ask class on the environment (   [ sect_nair_abra ] ) .",
    "@xcite provide a measurement of the local density estimated from the distance to the 4th or 5th nearest neighbor , and we find almost no dependence of the relationship on whether low or high density environment galaxies are selected .",
    "of course early types are more often present in dense environments , but we do not find that the relationship with spectral class tightens or becomes more loose in dense environments ( but see the comment on s0s below ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the idea expressed by @xcite that the environment affects the probability of finding early types or late types , but once a particular galaxy is chosen , its properties depend little on the environment . in this sense ,",
    "the possibility of presenting varied spectra given the hubble type seems to be a property of the individual galaxies , rather than being stimulated or directed by nearby galaxies .",
    "on top of this overall stability of the relationship , we note a slight excess of s0s with respect to es in dense environments .",
    "this trend seems to agree with the finding that s0s become relatively more frequent towards the centers of the clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate variation with redshift of the color - shape relationship using a volume limited subsample mainly formed by luminous red galaxies (   [ sect_redshift ] ) . from redshift @xmath1 to now some galaxies redden as expected from the passive evolution of their stellar populations .",
    "one of the ask classes , number 6 , is known to gather active galactic nuclei ( agns , * ? ? ?",
    "this class seems to be formed by galaxies with a wide range of hubble types , from e to sd  see fig .",
    "[ nair1]a as well as table  [ table_ask ] , the later showing this class to have a large negative kurtosis characteristic of a spreadout distribution function . this spread of morphological types is a known property of agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "two of the red ask classes , 1 and 4 , have been found to be dominated by edge - on ( dust - reddened ) spirals . in an analysis",
    "not mentioned in the preceding sections , we reproduced the template spectrum characteristic of ask 1 and 4 with reddened spectra of bluer ask classes .",
    "one finds a good match of both line and continuum assuming a one magnitude extinction at @xmath90 distributed according to a milky way - like law @xcite .",
    "the fact that ask 1 and 4 are edge - on disks makes them suitable for a number of studies  for example , determining of the distribution of disk thicknesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or studying physical properties of the dust associated with ongoing star formation .",
    "they may also be used to calibrate weak lensing reconstructions since we know their intrinsic ( highly elongated ) shapes given the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the classification based on galsvm and described in   [ svm_sect ] is , in fact , a spectro - morphological classification .",
    "it includes colors together with other purely morphological parameters .",
    "surprisingly , the use of color does not reduce the scatter of the relationship between spectroscopic class and morphological type .",
    "the result is revealing , reflecting that the scatter of colors given a hubble type is intrinsic .",
    "the present work quantifies the relationship and scatter between hubble type and spectroscopic class existing in the local universe .",
    "it constrains the models and theories of galaxy evolution which should be able to account , not only for the global trend , but also for the scatter .",
    "in other words , the challenge lies in explaining how and why galaxies with the same morphology end up with very different spectra , and how and why galaxies with similar spectra may have different hubble types .",
    "thanks are due to j. knapen and i. garca  de  la  rosa for clarifying discussions on dust - reddened edge - on sps , and on bulges of large sps misclassified as red sps .",
