    "it is expected that space - time has a quantum structure at very short distances .",
    "however , the concrete form of this quantum structure is not known up to now . the different approaches to quantum gravity",
    "provide different concepts .",
    "for example in loop quantum gravity , the states are formed by so called spin networks , which are graphs having edges labeled by representations of @xmath0 and nodes labeled with intertwining operators that match the representations meeting at the respective node .",
    "another concept is non - commutative geometry , which tries to generalize mathematical properties of ordinary manifolds to non - commutative algebras .",
    "some time ago , it was shown that also non - commutative structures emerges from solutions of string theory based yang - mills matrix models such as the ikkt and bfss model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these structures are very similar to the structure developed in non - commutative geometry .",
    "a compact manifolds of dimension @xmath1 is replaced by a set of @xmath1 finite dimensional matrices @xmath2 , which may be seen as the quantized coordinate functions of a non - commutative manifold .    up to now , only some examples of fuzzy spaces with very high symmetry have been explicitly constructed and studied .",
    "all these spaces have in common that they are associated with a classical manifold , which is the commutative limit of a series of respective fuzzy spaces numbered by a parameter .",
    "recently , it was shown that also more general matrix algebras may be associated with a classical manifold by finding a set of generalized coherent states for the matrix algebra . in @xcite",
    "this set of coherent states was defined based on finding minimal energy states of a quadratic hamiltonian operator . in @xcite , coming from specific effective lagrangians derived from string theory , a corresponding hamiltonian similar to a dirac operator was proposed , and its zero modes were used for defining the classical manifold . in @xcite it was shown that these two approaches can be based on the same footing . in @xcite two - dimensional surfaces emerging from the hamiltonian defined in @xcite",
    "were studied in more detail .",
    "interestingly , for the more symmetric fuzzy spaces , which mainly are based on coadjoint orbits of lie groups , the set of coherent states are very similar to the coadjoint orbit ( seen as a manifold ) .",
    "this approach makes it possible to study less symmetric fuzzy spaces by investigating the set of coherent states of the fuzzy space .",
    "also fuzzy spaces without a classical limit may be studied . in this work",
    ", we will give a quite general construction scheme for matrix algebras based on three hermitian matrices , which result in surfaces of coherent states of arbitrary genus .",
    "surfaces of higher order genus were also considered in @xcite without providing an explicit representation for a genus higher than 1 .    in the following chapter 2 , we mainly review the content of @xcite , which will be used in the following chapter 3 .",
    "in general , the set of coherent states can be defined on a laplace operator @xcite or a dirac operator @xcite . in the case of the laplace operator",
    ", a coherent state may be defined as state with minimal energy , i.e. having a minimal eigenvalue for the laplace operator . in the case of the dirac operator",
    ", a coherent state may be defined based on the square of the dirac operator @xcite . in this case , a very interesting class of coherent states arise , which are the zero modes of the dirac operator , i.e. states with zero eigenvalue .    very important for the following is the observation that in the last case , it is not necessary to determine the coherent states , when one is only interested in the shape of the set of coherent states .",
    "to this end , we will define a functional , which is the determinant of the dirac operator .",
    "whenever , the dirac operator has a zero eigenvalue , this functional vanishes .",
    "since for finite - dimensional matrices the determinant is a polynomial in the matrix entries , the set of coherent states or the surface of zero modes is the manifold defined by the zero points of this polynomial .",
    "the set of zero points of a polynomial easily can be visualized with a computer program , which we mainly use to show the shapes of the surfaces of zero modes .    in chapter 3",
    "we then define a mapping from directed graphs with @xmath3 nodes to three hermitian @xmath4-matrices . for many known fuzzy spaces , such as the fuzzy sphere , fuzzy torus and the fuzzy plane",
    ", we construct the corresponding graphs .",
    "we will see that all these fuzzy spaces are based on unbranched graphs . by generalizing to branched graphs",
    ", we then realize fuzzy spaces of higher genus ( or at least with zero modes surfaces of higher genus ) .",
    "in this chapter we mainly review the approach of investigating a fuzzy space based on coherent states as put forward in @xcite .",
    "a fuzzy space is defined via a set of @xmath1 hermitian @xmath4-matrices @xmath5 @xmath6 , which may be interpreted as the quantized embedding functions @xmath7 of a classical manifold embedded in @xmath8 .",
    "there are numerous examples for such spaces , such as the fuzzy sphere or the fuzzy torus .",
    "it is also possible that the matrices are infinite dimensional , which , for example , is the case for the fuzzy plane . in general , these matrices may be seen as hermitian operators of an possibly infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the algebra generated by the matrices @xmath2 can be interpreted as the non - commutative version of the function algebra of the fuzzy space .",
    "there is a correspondence of states @xmath9 of the hilbert space the matrix algebra acts on , and the elements of the matrix algebra . for every normalized state @xmath9",
    "there is an projector @xmath10 in the matrix algebra . on the other hand for every projector @xmath11 with @xmath12 in the matrix algebra",
    ", there is a state @xmath9 with @xmath13 .",
    "coherent states may be interpreted as generalization of @xmath14functions , but we do not explore this direction further .      for every state @xmath9 we can calculate the expectation value of the matrices @xmath2 @xmath15 and based on the standard deviation @xmath16 the dispersion @xmath17 of a state may be defined @xmath18    a coherent state is now a state with minimal dispersion . according to perelomov @xcite coherent states can be defined on representations of lie groups . on more general fuzzy spaces , without the action of a group ,",
    "the notion of coherent states can be generalized .    in @xcite",
    "it is proposed to restrict to states , which have a low dispersion and are localized at a specific point @xmath19 , meaning that the expectation values @xmath20 are low in some sense .",
    "for example , both dispersion and localization may be optimized simultaneously by minimizing the function @xmath21 which may be interpreted as the energy of a string attached to the fuzzy space and extending to the point @xmath19 .",
    "this energy may be derived by defining an extended coordinate function on a background space    @xmath22    which may be interpreted as the fuzzy space ( or non - commutative brane ) together with a point probe at the point @xmath7 .",
    "the off - diagonal entries    @xmath23    on the background space may be interpreted as strings interconnecting the point probe with the fuzzy space . on the background space",
    "an extended laplace operator @xmath24 can be defined , which when applied to the `` strings '' results in @xmath25=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }   & \\delta_{x}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle \\\\",
    "\\left\\langle \\psi\\right|\\delta_{x } \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a localized laplace operator    @xmath27    the localized laplace operator has the property that @xmath28 or @xmath29 with @xmath30 as defined in ( [ eq : laplace string energy ] ) .",
    "thus , the quasi - coherent states are ground states of the localized laplace operator and in principle , the quasi - coherent states can be determined by solving an eigenvalue problem .    as an alternative , quasi - coherent spinor states",
    "may be considered @xcite . on the background space with the point probe",
    ", also a dirac operator @xmath31 can be defined , which when acting on spinorial , off - diagonal `` strings '' results in a localized dirac operator @xmath32=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }   & d_{x}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle \\\\",
    "\\left\\langle \\psi\\right|d_{x } \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] here , the @xmath33 are the @xmath34$]-dimensional generators of the clifford algebra associated with @xmath8 , @xmath35 is a spinor valued matrix on the background and @xmath9 is a spinor valued vector .",
    "the localized dirac operator is @xmath36 the quasi - coherent spinor states can then be defined as the ground states of    @xmath37    note that the string energy @xmath38 defined by the square of the localized dirac operator @xmath39 differs from the string energy @xmath30 of the localized laplace operator @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) .    when one has defined quasi - coherent states , every point @xmath19 of @xmath8 may be assigned to the minimal string energy @xmath40 of the localized laplace operator @xmath26 or the localized dirac operator @xmath41 at that point @xmath19 .",
    "we can define the minimal string energy by @xmath42 the function @xmath43 is differentiable nearly everywhere , expect at points , where minimal eigenvalues cross . at points , where the minimal string energy @xmath43 is much higher than an overall minimal string energy",
    ", we expect that the one end of the string located at @xmath7 is far away from the fuzzy space defined by the matrices @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , when the minimal string energy @xmath43 is small , we expect that we are near the fuzzy space .",
    "due to ( [ eq : laplace string energy ] ) , we see that when the string is moved away from the fuzzy space , the energy should rise at least quadratically .",
    "a computer program for determining point sets with `` small '' string energies is described in @xcite .      in @xcite",
    "the observation was made that nearly all known fuzzy spaces not only have coherent states defined by ( [ eq : laplace string energy ] ) but also - which at a first glance seems to be more restrictive - defined by the zero modes of ( [ eq : localized dirac ] ) . in particular , when the localized dirac operator @xmath41 ( [ eq : localized dirac ] ) has a zero mode , i.e. the corresponding quasi - coherent state is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath44 : @xmath45 , then @xmath46 and the ( never negative ) string energy defined by the positive definite hermitian operator @xmath47 is minimal at these points .",
    "when the matrices defining the fuzzy space are finite dimensional , the above statement is equivalent to @xmath48 as was already noted in @xcite .",
    "the left hand side of this equation defines a multivariate polynomial of the @xmath1 variables @xmath7 of order @xmath49n$ ] , where @xmath50 $ ] takes the whole number of its argument . considering the part @xmath51 inside the determinant ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) , since the @xmath33 contain an entry @xmath52 or @xmath53 in every row and an even number of minus signs , the determinant comprises @xmath54 as term of highest order .",
    "thus , as a function , the polynomial goes to @xmath55infinity for @xmath56 going to infinity .",
    "if there is at least one point at which the polynomial is smaller or bigger than @xmath44 , opposite to the sign of the highest term , then there has to be a submanifold that surrounds this point , on which the polynomial vanishes . in the following",
    ", we will call this manifold `` zero modes manifold '' or `` zero modes surface '' in the case of a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "the determinant functional ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) has similar properties as the index function defined in @xcite :    * it is invariant under unitary transformations @xmath57 * it is covariant under translations , rotations and scaling @xmath58 * if the matrices are block diagonal , i.e. the fuzzy spaces is defined by the direct sum of two smaller fuzzy spaces @xmath59 the determinant splits @xmath60 which is equivalent to @xmath61 in this case , the overall zero modes manifold is the combine of the zero modes manifolds of the fuzzy spaces defined by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the invariance with respect to unitary transformations has interesting implications .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : unitary_trafo ] ) may be seen as non - commutative symplectic coordinate transformation , since for @xmath64@xmath65 a function on the fuzzy space transforms like @xmath66 furthermore , since explicitly @xmath67 , the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath64 have the same zero modes manifold .",
    "to get used to the determinant functional ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) , we study it in low space and low matrix dimensions :    * in one matrix dimension , i.e. @xmath68 , equation ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) reduces to @xmath69 , i.e. the one - dimensional matrices @xmath2 define a point in @xmath8 .",
    "+ there is an interesting consequence , when a fuzzy space is defined by @xmath1 commuting @xmath3-dimensional matrices @xmath2 . in this case , the matrices @xmath2 are simultaneously diagonalizable , the determinant functional ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) is invariant with respect to the transformation necessary for diagonalizing the matrices , and due to the splitting property , the matrices @xmath2 define @xmath3 points in @xmath8 . * in one space dimension , @xmath70 there is only one matrix @xmath71 , the matrix can be diagonalized and the eigenvalues define @xmath3 points on the line @xmath72 .",
    "* in two space dimensions @xmath73 , with two matrices @xmath71 and @xmath74 , equation ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) reduces to @xmath75 thus with @xmath76 and @xmath77 we arrive at @xmath78 the zero modes manifold of this fuzzy space is defined by the complex eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "in the last case with @xmath73 , there is an example , the fuzzy disc @xcite , which may be described by @xmath80 , i.e. an upper triangular matrix . for every upper triangular matrix @xmath81 ,",
    "i.e. the eigenvalues are all zero .",
    "the zero modes manifold is only the origin . however , equation ( [ eq:2d - det_dirac ] ) is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "i.e. for large @xmath3 , inside the circle with radius @xmath83 it is almost zero and outside of the circle it is very large .",
    "this may justify to speak of a fuzzy disc .",
    "however , the fuzzy disc does not have a surface as zero modes manifold .",
    "what will be very important in the following is the case of three space dimensions @xmath84 , with three matrices @xmath85 @xmath74 and @xmath86 . then equation ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) becomes @xmath87 where we have set @xmath76and @xmath77 .",
    "in the following , we give a mapping between directed graphs and three matrices @xmath85 @xmath74 and @xmath86 , which , in the case of sparse matrices , will result in a fuzzy space that ( substantially ) has the same topology as the graph .",
    "we will use the determinant functional ( [ eq : det_dirac ] ) to determine the zero modes surface of specific graphs and will show , how to define graphs that are mapped to fuzzy spaces with a desired topology of the zero modes surface .",
    "the basic building block is a graph with two nodes and one edge .",
    "we label the two nodes with two points in @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the edge is labeled with two complex numbers @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this graph is mapped to the matrices    @xmath93    when the numbers @xmath91 and @xmath92 are real , we will see that a very helpful visualization is that the two points are interconnected with a closed string that emerges from the first point , blows up to an ellipse with radii @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the @xmath19- respective @xmath94-direction and shrinks to the second point .",
    "a further analogy comes from the comparison with ( [ eq : strings_pointprobe ] ) : the numbers @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the extreme case of strings interconnecting the two point - probes @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is also possible to map the hermitian matrices @xmath71 and @xmath74 to one complex matrix @xmath79 via @xmath76 . in this case , the coordinates for @xmath19 and @xmath94 may be provided with two complex numbers @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the `` string radii '' with two complex numbers @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "more general , a permutation of nodes corresponds to a permutation of a basis of the hilbert space , the matrices act on .",
    "furthermore , the graph has directed edges , which interconnect the nodes ( only at least one edge interconnects two nodes ) .",

    "in particular :    * the diagonal entries of the matrices are filled with the coordinates of the points , i.e. @xmath130 * when the graph has an edge from node @xmath126 to node @xmath127 , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath71 and @xmath74are filled according to @xmath131 * the other entries of the matrices are zero .",

    "the mapping is @xmath132 @xmath133    here , changing the direction of an edge from @xmath126 to @xmath127 corresponds to exchanging @xmath134 with @xmath135 .    for three arbitrary hermitian matrices",
    "it is also possible to provide an inverse mapping that results in a graph with a set of matrices that are equivalent to these matrices up to a unitary transformation . in particular , the three arbitrary matrices and the matrices of the graph have the same zero modes surface :    since the three arbitrary matrices are hermitian , one matrix , say @xmath86 , can be diagonalized with a unitary transformation .",
    "the other two matrices @xmath71 and @xmath74 can be transformed with this unitary transformation . from the transformed matrices @xmath71 and @xmath74 and the diagonalized matrix @xmath86 , the diagonal entries form the points of the graph . for every non - zero diagonal entry of @xmath71 and @xmath74 an edge",
    "has to be added to the graph , which labels @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be read off the corresponding diagonal entries . due to the choice of matrix , which is diagonalized , there are in principle three different graphs associated with three hermitian matrices .",
    "interestingly , after diagonalizing @xmath86 , what is left over from the symmetry of unitary transformations are permutations of the eigenvectors ( which are basis vectors for the space , on which the matrices act ) and phase transformations of the eigenvectors .",
    "the permutation of eigenvectors corresponds to a permutation of a numbering of the nodes of the graph , i.e. the mapping is well - defined for graphs with unnumbered nodes .",

    "<S> fuzzy spaces like the fuzzy sphere or the fuzzy torus have received remarkable attention , since they appeared as objects in string theory . although there are higher dimensional examples , the most known and most studied fuzzy spaces are realized as matrix algebras defined by three hermitian matrices , which may be seen as fuzzy membrane or fuzzy surface . </S>",
    "<S> we give a mapping between directed graphs and matrix algebras defined by three hermitian matrices and show that the matrix algebras of known two - dimensional fuzzy spaces are associated with unbranched graphs . by including branchings into the graphs we find matrix algebras that represent fuzzy spaces associated with surfaces having genus 2 and higher . </S>"
