    "the formation and evolution of the dark matter halo which can be treated as the self - gravitational collisionless stellar system have become a challenging issue in the study of dark matter .",
    "thanks to the improved computational power , n - body simulations of dark matter halos become more and more accurate and important with increasing resolution .",
    "n - body simulations such as the universal nfw profile@xcite and others@xcite show that the density profiles of dark matter halos behave as @xmath6 , where @xmath1 in the center and @xmath2 in the outer parts of halos .",
    "however , the numerical inner behaviors of dark matter halos are not supported by observations.@xcite some work indicates that density profiles of dark matter halos might become shallower than @xmath7 in the center@xcite , and perhaps even tend to be a core with no cusp at all.@xcite    n - body simulations not only provide us the density profiles of halos , but also give the relevant information of the velocity space of collisionless particles in the halos .",
    "velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles@xcite have been well described by simple analytical fits .",
    "two interesting phenomena from simulations indicate that velocity dispersion and the density profiles of the haloes are not independent .",
    "first , hansen and moore@xcite found that the density logarithmic slope @xmath8 is correlated to the velocity anisotropy which is parameterized by the anisotropy parameter @xmath9 and they provided the empirical formula @xmath10 .",
    "therefore @xmath3 ( isotropic velocity dispersion ) in the inner part as @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the outer part as @xmath13 .",
    "second , it has been argued@xcite that the so called pseudo phase - space density follows a power law @xmath14 with exponent @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density profile and @xmath17 is the total velocity dispersion .",
    "subsequent studies have confirmed that @xmath18 is a power law in radius , but the best fitting values of the exponent @xmath19 diverse from each other@xcite and range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . because @xmath4 has the same dimension as the phase - space density ,",
    "@xmath4 has been called pseudo phase - space density or `` poor - man s '' phase - space density@xcite .    with these results in mind ,",
    "much theoretical work has been done for the study of the relation between density profile behavior and pseudo phase - space density .",
    "some authors examine this matter by solving the jeans equation .",
    "williams et al got a critical exponents@xcite @xmath22 and dehnen and mclaughlin calculated corresponding density profiles in both isotropic and anisotropic cases@xcite . some other work solved the jeans equation to explore the relation between density profile and pseudo phase - space density @xcite .",
    "recently , r. n. henriksen@xcite considered a series expansion for a dark matter distribution function in the spherically symmetric anisotropic limit to discuss pseudo phase - space density .    in this paper , we concentrate on the center of the dark matter halo where the velocity dispersion is almost isotropic and calculate the distribution function and pseudo phase - space density where @xmath23 in the spherically symmetric case . in section 2 we review the basic knowledge about distribution function which is needed for this paper . in section 3 , the distribution function , velocity dispersion and pseudo phase - space density in the center of the dark matter halo are calculated with the given density profile .",
    "we make the discussion and conclusion in section 4 .",
    "in the center of dark matter halos , with spherically symmetric assumption , the distribution function @xmath24 can be reduced to @xmath25 as anisotropy parameter @xmath3 ( almost isotropic ) when @xmath23 .",
    "if we know the distribution function , we can calculate the density profile and total velocity dispersion profile as below:@xcite , @xmath26    @xmath27    where the binding energy @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the relative gravitational potential which can be obtained from the poisson equation : @xmath31 @xmath32 is the radial velocity and @xmath33 is the tangential velocity : @xmath34 eddington@xcite provided the inversion formula of eq .",
    "( [ rhoiso ] ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the 2nd order differentiation operator with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter@xcite mentioned in the introduction is defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the tangential and radial velocity dispersion . if @xmath40 , the velocity dispersion is tangentially anisotropic .",
    "@xmath41 correspond to the radially anisotropic cases , and @xmath42 , the isotropic case .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the distribution function and pseudo phase - space density with the given density profile in the very central region of the spherically symmetric dark matter halo where the velocity dispersion is almost isotropic .",
    "let us consider a family of density profiles with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 named as new generalized nfw profiles,@xcite @xmath45    we set the characteristic radius @xmath46 , the total mass @xmath47 and the gravitational constant @xmath48 here .",
    "then the density profiles reduce to    @xmath49    @xmath50    then the relative potential @xmath30 can be calculated from the poisson eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson]).@xcite @xmath51 \\\\ &   a_2(r)=\\ _ 2\\tilde{f}_1[2-a+\\epsilon,\\ -a,\\ 2-a,\\ -r ] \\\\ &   a_3(r)=\\ _",

    "and then , we calculate the asymptotic approximation of @xmath55 and @xmath56 as below :    @xmath57    @xmath58    from @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we can get the asymptotic approximation of @xmath59 when using eq .",

    "\\label{fe } \\end{split}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    we should note that this result of distribution function is only valid in the very center of dark matter halo where the velocity dispersion is almost isotropic . in the outer part of the halo , no matter whether the velocity dispersion is isotropic or not , this result is invalid and even unphysical .",
    "it s easy to note that , when @xmath23 , the binding energy @xmath28 approaches to its maximum value @xmath61 .",
    "following this observation , we can further reduce eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) in the parameter space @xmath62 which has covered the result of simulations . nevertheless , it s just in this parameter scope that f(e ) in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) is physically meaningful : @xmath63    by using equations ( [ sigma ] ) , ( [ rhopsi ] ) and ( [ limitfe ] ) , we can get the total velocity dispersion in the very center of the halo , @xmath64 ,   \\label{limitsigma } \\\\ & \\\\ & \\begin{array}{rcl } \\left._2f_1[\\frac{5}{2},\\ \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{2}{a-2},\\ \\frac{7}{2},\\ \\frac{\\psi}{\\psi-\\psi_0}]\\right|_{\\psi\\rightarrow \\psi_0}&=&\\frac{5(a-2)}{4(a-1)}(\\frac{\\psi}{\\psi_0-\\psi})^{-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{a-2 } } \\\\ \\\\ & & + \\frac{15\\sqrt{\\pi}\\gamma(-2-\\frac{2}{a-2})}{8\\gamma(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{2}{a-2})}(\\frac{\\psi}{\\psi_0-\\psi})^{-5/2}. \\end{array } \\end{split}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] then , it s not difficult to simplify equation ( [ limitsigma ] ) to the final result : @xmath65 and substitute equation ( [ limitpsir ] ) into equation ( [ sigma2 ] ) to transform @xmath66 into @xmath67 @xmath68    now , after we know the total velocity dispersion and the density profile in the very center of the halo , the pseudo phase - space density can be calculated directly ,    @xmath69    the power - law behaviour of the pseudo phase - space density was first found by simulation@xcite and analyzed by subsequent theoretic work@xcite , but its physical meaning is still unclear . for this consideration ,",
    "let us compare the distribution function and pseudo phase - space density in the very center of the halo .",
    "we should note that the velocity of particles , which may stably exist in the very center of the halo , approaches to @xmath70 with @xmath23 . if the velocity term of the binding energy eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) or the total velocity dispersion @xmath17 is much smaller than the second term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ limitpsir ] ) or at most has the same asymptotic behavior as the second term of rhs of eq .",
    "( [ limitpsir ] ) , this condition requires @xmath71 which can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ limitpsir ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ sigma : r2 ] ) , then @xmath72 . with this formula and eq .",
    "( [ limitfe ] ) , we can get @xmath73 from eq .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) , we see that , if @xmath74 , the distribution function and the pseudo phase - space density have the same asymptotic behavior where @xmath23 .",
    "this result indicates that the `` poor - man s '' phase - space density is not so poor but might relate to real phase - space density at least in the very center of the halo .",
    "n - body simulations show us some properties of the dark matter halo , such as density profile @xmath16 , anisotropy parameter @xmath9 , pseudo phase - space density , and so on .",
    "although the simulation s resolution is limited , these information should be considered properly in the theoretic analysis in order to make theoretic work more realistic .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the problem of the center of the halo based on the following facts : ( 1 ) the existence of universal density profiles such as nfw@xcite , moore99@xcite , and in particular the new generalized nfw profile used in our work ; ( 2 ) anisotropy parameter @xmath3 in the center of the halo ; ( 3 ) the pseudo phase space density follows a power law in radius @xmath5 ; ( 4 ) limited resolution in the central region .",
    "we should notice that in this paper all results are only valid in the very center of the halo . from a given density profile",
    ", we calculate the asymptotic approximation of the distribution function in the very center of the halo .",
    "then the total velocity dispersion and the pseudo phase - space density are obtained from the distribution function .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) shows the relation between the two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath43 .",
    "if we set @xmath75 as some simulations indicate , then @xmath43 should be 0.776 which is smaller than nfw s result .",
    "otherwise , if we set @xmath76 to adapt nfw profile and moore s profile , then @xmath77 which is larger than the simulations result .",
    "this apparent contradiction between theoretic result and simulation is not so weird since the resolution in the central region is nt high enough to describe the very central region of the dark matter halo .    comparing the distribution function ( real phase - space density ) with the pseudo phase - space density",
    ", we find that they have the same asymptotic behavior if @xmath78 .",
    "this result indicates that the distribution function and pseudo phase - space density are closely related , even though the assertion is rather premature that the distribution function might have a power - law behavior just as the pseudo phase - space density in the whole range of radius @xmath5 .",
    "this interesting suggestion may also give us more confidence in the study of pseudo phase - space density and some new clues to the construction of the distribution function . by the way",
    ", some authors@xcite also study the pseudo phase - space density in from @xmath79 .",
    "it is obvious that our conclusion in this paper is well - founded only if @xmath80 .",
    "so , from this point of view , @xmath4 may be the best choice of the pseudo phase - space density .    for the intensive study of the dark matter halo ,",
    "the full range of radius @xmath5 should be involved .",
    "we need to consider how to extend the relationship between `` real '' and `` pseudo '' phase - space density from the very central region to other regions where the velocity dispersion is anisotropic .",
    "furthermore , reasonable knowledge and new strategies should be introduced and developed for the construction of more realistic models .",
    "first , it is admitted that dark matter halos in the real world are not spherically symmetric .",
    "second , the physics in the center of the halo may be very complicated .",
    "third , the halo actually is a polycomponent system which contains the dark matter , baryonic matter and even a supermassive black hole in the center .",
    "it is not radical to say that new methods and ideas are still needed in the future research on this matter .",
