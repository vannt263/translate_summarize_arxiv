    "the probability @xmath4 to draw an event @xmath5 from a set of @xmath6 possible events is defined as the limes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the relative frequency to find the @xmath5-th event @xmath9 times in a randomly chosen sample of @xmath3 . according to the law of large numbers",
    "the relative frequencies stochastically converge to the corresponding probabilities , hence , for very large sample size @xmath10 we can practically identify both values . for smaller sample size , however , the distribution of relative frequencies may deviate significantly from the probability distribution ( e.g.  @xcite and many others ) .",
    "assume further the equidistribution @xmath0 , then for very large sample size @xmath10 one expects that all or almost all of the @xmath6 possible events are found in the sample and occur with approximately equal frequency , whereas in the opposite case @xmath11 almost all events occur only once or a few times in the sample , i.e. the latter frequency distribution will deviate significantly from the former one . from this simple argumentation",
    "one may conclude that the frequency distribution which one expects depends sensitively on the sample size @xmath3 .",
    "this type of finite size effects is of major relevance for statistical analysis of dna and other biosequences , e.g. @xcite . in this article",
    "we want to calculate the expected frequency distribution which one finds in dependence on the sample size @xmath3 .",
    "if we draw a frequency distribution of @xmath6 different events there are @xmath12 possibilities to arrange the events along the abscissa . an arrangement which leads to a decaying function for the frequencies or probabilities we call a zipf order and the corresponding distribution a zipf ordered distribution . to find a zipf ordered frequency distribution which we have to expect if @xmath3 events from an equidistribution",
    "are drawn we have to determine in dependence on @xmath3 how many events ( on average ) are not drawn , i.e.  are drawn zero times , how many are drawn once , twice etc .    in the next section",
    "we derive the expectation value for the number @xmath13 of those events which ocurr @xmath5 times in the sample .",
    "the analytic expression is then used to infer the unknown number @xmath6 of total events and to compare the theoretically expected zipf ordered frequency distribution with the measured one .",
    "the results are useful in connection with entropy estimates computed from finite samples .",
    "the result of @xmath3 subsequent drawings from a set of @xmath6 different equiprobable events can be identified with randomly placing @xmath3 indistinguishable balls in @xmath6 indistinguishable urns , each having the same probability @xmath15 . denoting the number of urns containing exactly @xmath5 balls by @xmath16 , a possible outcome can be shortly described by the vector @xmath17",
    "; this is what we call a cluster configuration . the number of empty urns is given by @xmath18 and , consequently , the number of occupied urns by @xmath19 .",
    "any admissible cluster configuration obeys the following two conditions @xmath20 we are interested in the stochastic variable @xmath14 , denoting the number of urns each filled with exactly @xmath5 balls , and its expectation value @xmath13 .",
    "introducing for each @xmath21 and each urn @xmath22 its related indicator @xmath23 by the following definition @xmath24 the random variable @xmath14 is related to the stochastic indicators by @xmath25 . due to the additivity of the expectation operator",
    "we find @xmath26 where we have used that all @xmath27 are identical .",
    "the probability to find exactly @xmath5 balls in any of the urns ( here labeled @xmath28 ) and the remaining balls distributed arbitrarily among the remaining @xmath29 urns is the binomial distribution , hence , @xmath30 the expectation value @xmath13 indicates how often events in a sample of size @xmath3 occur exactly @xmath5 times on average .",
    "we call these occupation numbers @xmath5-clusters",
    ". obviously , for small @xmath11 nearly all of the @xmath6 possible events are 0-clusters , i.e. , they do not occur in our sample . as @xmath3 increases the number of single occupations increases as well . for still growing @xmath3",
    "the number of multiple occupation becomes larger and , therefore , the number of 1-clusters decreases as more and more events occur multiple times in the sample .",
    "figure [ fig : mom ] shows the occupation of the @xmath6 possible different events as a function of the sample size @xmath3 .",
    "the lines show the theoretical result eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) and the symbols in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : mom ] show the clusters as they have been found in sets of random numbers .",
    "if we draw only once a sample of size @xmath3 from a set of @xmath6 possible events and calculate the occupation numbers ( the cluster frequencies ) the cluster distribution itself is fluctuating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : konv ] , filled dots ) .",
    "averaging the cluster distribution over a number of independent selections each of size @xmath3 the cluster distribution converges to the theoretical curve predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : konv ] shows the cluster distribution as found from a random sample of size @xmath3 out of @xmath31 allowed events together with cluster distributions averaged over 100 independent drawings .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) allows to determine the expectation value of the number of different events @xmath32 in dependence on the total number of drawn events @xmath3 , which is simply related to the expected probability to find a cluster of size zero : @xmath33 from which we compute @xmath34 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\cdot\\exp\\left[-{\\cal o } \\left(\\frac{m}{n^2}\\right)\\right ] \\label{eq : nstart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nstart ] ) we see that for all @xmath35 eq . ( [ eq : nstar ] ) can be approximated to very good accuracy by @xmath36 a result which has been found before by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the maximal _ absolute _ deviation is @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) which falls rapidly to @xmath39 as @xmath6 goes to infinity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nstar ] the analytical result ( [ eq : nstar ] ) is compared with a simulation .",
    "the impulses in the figure show the results of a single realization . if we average the numerical results over several runs the numerical curve falls together with the analytical one .    for the wide range of practical interest , @xmath40 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nstarapprox ] ) we may approximate the entropy of the distribution if we know the number of different events @xmath32 contained in a sample of size @xmath3 : @xmath41    we want to compile the results from the previous section to find the desired zipf ordered frequency distribution . equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) tells how many , in average , events do not occur in the sample ( drawn zero times ) , how many are drawn once , twice , etc .",
    "this yields directly the zipf ordered frequency distribution @xmath42 using stirling s formula to expand the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) the analytical result eq .",
    "( [ eq : hauf ] ) can be written easily in elementary functions .",
    "figure [ fig : zipf ] shows zipf ordered frequency distributions calculated from a sample of random numbers ( dashed lines ) together with the theoretical distributions due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hauf ] ) ( solid lines ) .",
    "the combinatorial theory derived in the previous section predicts the zipf ordered frequency distribution which results from an equidistribution with good accuracy .",
    "based on combinatorial considerations we calculated the expectation values to find @xmath16 events _ exactly _ @xmath5 times in a sample of size @xmath3 which have been drawn from an equidistribution .",
    "these cluster probabilities allow to estimate the total number of events @xmath6 , given the number of _ different _ events found in a sample of size @xmath3 is known .",
    "moreover , the full zipf ordered frequency distribution could be constructed . by numerical simulations",
    "it has been demonstrated that the analytically derived values coincide with `` experimental '' results , i.e. , with cluster distributions and zipf ordered frequency distributions originating from finite samples of random numbers ."
