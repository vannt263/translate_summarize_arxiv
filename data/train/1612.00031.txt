    "over the past few years , the study of metamaterials , i.e. , artificially engineered structures exhibiting electromagnetic ( em ) properties not commonly observed in nature , has seen an explosion of interest @xcite .",
    "an especially intriguing aspect of these metamaterials is their so - called left - handed ( lh ) nature , which features simultaneously negative effective permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 , i.e. , the relevant signs of these quantities are opposite to those of conventional right - handed ( rh ) media .",
    "the resulting difference between these two scenarios is that in the lh ( rh ) regime , the energy and the wave fronts of the em waves propagate in opposite ( same ) directions , giving rise to backward- ( forward- ) propagating waves .",
    "consequently , these left handed metamaterials ( lhm ) can exhibit negative refraction at microwave @xcite or optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "apart from a classical em approach involving the study of an effective medium , which can naturally be used to study such metamaterial media  @xcite , transmission line ( tl ) theory constitutes a convenient framework to analyze their evolutionary dynamics .",
    "a tl - based analysis relies on the connection of the em properties of the medium ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with the electric elements of the tl unit cell , namely , the serial and shunt impedance  @xcite .",
    "equivalent tl models have been used to describe periodic lattices of prototypical magnetic and electric metamaterial structures in the form of split ring resonators ( srrs ) and complementary split ring resonators ( csrrs )  @xcite . in this context , each of the srrs / csrrs can be analyzed in the form of a corresponding lc circuit , while the whole metamaterial is an array of such circuits , with the coupling between the elements being modeled by a mutual inductance / capacitance . the serial and shunt impedance are directly related to the actual properties of these structures .",
    "in addition to the more standard case of linear lhms , the study of nonlinear lhms has been receiving increased attention @xcite . here",
    ", the em properties  such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , the serial and shunt impedance at the tl level )  depend on the intensity of the em field ( equivalently at the tl level , e.g. , on the voltage ) . practical proposals for the experimental realization of such features involve embedding an array of wires and srrs into a nonlinear dielectric  @xcite , or the insertion of diodes ( varactors ) into resonant conductive elements , such as the srrs  @xcite .",
    "the interplay of strong dispersion exhibited by left handed transmission lines with the nonlinear voltage dependence of the group velocity results in unusual dynamical behavior . in this theme ,",
    "the extensive theoretical studies have led to numerous experimental realizations of features such as pulse propagation @xcite , envelope soliton formation @xcite and the emergence of bright @xcite or dark @xcite solitons ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite , and the more recent work @xcite for soliton generation in active metamaterials . a relevant  but earlier  review of experimental studies can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our present considerations , we study a nonlinear left handed transmission line . in part , we are motivated specifically by the recent development of strongly nonlinear and voltage symmetric barium strontium titanate ( bst ) thin film capacitors  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider a nonlinear lhm through a tl approach , which exhibits the symmetric capacitance - voltage dependence .",
    "our aim is to investigate the properties of the nonlinear waveforms that arise and are robustly sustained by this lhm . to gain theoretical insight into this ,",
    "we utilize a multiscale expansion method that reduces the model , in a self - consistent fashion ( up to cubic order in a suitable amplitude parameter ) , to a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite .",
    "we identify regimes , depending on the frequency of the carrier wave , where the nls equation is focusing or defocusing .",
    "the prototypical soliton solutions of this model , namely the bright and the dark soliton , are found to be robustly preserved by the transmission line dynamics .",
    "however , a more ambitious goal of the present study is to examine whether _ rogue wave _ ( rw ) patterns , such as the peregrine soliton ( ps ) of the focusing nls equation , can emerge in the lh transmission line .",
    "the only work that we are aware of connecting these two themes ( lhms and rws ) is that of  @xcite , which focuses on a rather qualitative comparison for very short propagation distances .",
    "here , we actually _ engineer _ initial data that , at the nls level , would lead to a ps profile . as a result of the dynamics ,",
    "we observe both similarities with and differences from what we expect at the nls level .",
    "we discuss these at some length and the impact that the intrinsic features of the lhm system have on the potential emergence and form of the peregrine - like structure .",
    "we do not restrict our considerations to solely this rogue wave pattern ; rather , we extend them to additional members of the relevant family of solutions , including the spatially periodic akhmediev breathers ( abs ) and the temporally periodic kuznetsov - ma solitons ( kms ) .    our presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model , discuss the nature of the nonlinearity and explain the reduction to the nls setting . in section iii , we present prototypical numerical results not only for the bright and dark solitons but also , more importantly , for peregrine - like solitons / rogue waves and related ( periodic in space or time ) patterns .",

    "the study of solutions of the focusing nls involving extreme events ( associated with rogue waves ) has had a long and time - honored history through the works of peregrine  @xcite , kuznetsov  @xcite , ma  @xcite , akhmediev  @xcite , as well as of dysthe and trulsen  @xcite ; see also the reviews  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been the recent experiments in a wide range of areas that has significantly propelled the amount of interest in the related wave structures . in particular ,",

    "given the nls reduction , we can utilize the peregrine soliton solution of the focusing nls model in the form : @xmath72 ( here , as before , @xmath52 is the amplitude of the background carrier wave ) to reconstruct the initial condition of a waveform to be introduced in eq .",

    "figure  ( [ pere ] ) shows a peregrine soliton example with a small amplitude ; @xmath73 is used here .",
    "the dynamical evolution illustrates that the number of peaks progressively increases ; i.e. , while there is the emergence of the fundamental peak associated presumably with the peregrine soliton , for longer times an evolution somewhat reminiscent of modulational instability and the formation of a more complex pattern consisting of multiple breathing solitary wave entities appears to emerge .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention ( also in connection with the results that will follow ) that the growth towards the formation of the peregrine soliton is not monotonic ( as is expected by the exact solution ) .",
    "rather , there is a slight interval of amplitude decay before the growth , ultimately leading to the emergence of the extreme event .",
    "figure  [ peregrine_mu0 ] corresponds to a case of substantially larger initial voltage , where we expect the small amplitude reduction to no longer be valid .",
    "this case also illustrates a number of similarities and differences with respect to the original nls model . in the nls",
    ", a monotonic growth of the `` bulge '' develops leading to the peak of the peregrine soliton ( which thus seems to `` appear out of nowhere and disappear without a trace ''  @xcite ) . here , in our lattice , the growth still occurs , yet it involves a decay stage before the growth stage leading to the peak .",
    "after the formation of the peak , a somewhat unconventional sequence arises in the time evolution of the maximum . while , that is , we expect decay anew , this decay occurs only briefly , with another growth stage and a sharp ( in fact , even sharper than the previous one ) peak emerging .",

    "[ peregrine_mu0 ] illustrating the space time evolution until @xmath74 sheds light on this feature .",
    "in particular , what happens is that the original `` wider '' waveform splits into two narrower peaks , which evolve rather independently . at the level of the amplitude ,",
    "further evolution leads to decay and then once again to growth ( the latter time developing even higher voltage amplitudes ) .",
    "once again , the contour plots of the bottom panels for considerably larger times reveal the explanation : in a similar way as the single wave eventually grows and splits into two , the two subsequently proceed to split forming an additional one .",
    "this way , the number of wave structures appears to be increasing over time .",
    "while this is not consonant with the exact solution of the peregrine soliton in nls , we should note that it is reminiscent of an evolution leading to a progressive increase in the number of peaks in the recent work  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although it is far more ordered , it carries some of the breathing characteristics of the smaller amplitude case in fig .",
    "[ pere ] .",
    "thus , summarizing our findings , there exist definite similarities between the nls reduction and the dynamics of the lhm , including the formation of extreme wave patterns . nevertheless , there are also notable differences , such as the non - monotonic growth , or the breakup of the latter initial profile into multiple waves , which  especially at large amplitudes  seems to be more complex than what may be expected on the basis of the nls reduction .      as is well - known  @xcite , the peregrine soliton can be viewed as a low wavenumber or a low frequency limit of a generalized family of solutions including on the one hand the akhmediev breathers and on the other kuznetsov - ma solitons , respectively .",

    "<S> in the present work , we explore soliton and rogue - like wave solutions in the transmission line analogue of a nonlinear left - handed metamaterial . the nonlinearity is expressed through a voltage - dependent and symmetric capacitance motivated by the recently developed ferroelectric barium strontium titanate ( bst ) thin film capacitor designs . </S>",
    "<S> we develop both the corresponding nonlinear dynamical lattice , as well as its reduction via a multiple scales expansion to a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model for the envelope of a given carrier wave . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced model can feature either a focusing or a defocusing nonlinearity depending on the frequency ( wavenumber ) of the carrier . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the robustness of different types of solitary waves of the reduced model within the original nonlinear left - handed medium . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both bright and dark solitons persist in a suitable parametric regime , where the reduction to the nls is valid . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , for suitable initial conditions , we observe a rogue wave type of behavior , that differs significantly from the classic peregrine rogue wave evolution , including most notably the breakup of a single peregrine - like pattern into solutions with multiple wave peaks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we touch upon the behavior of generalized members of the family of the peregrine solitons , namely akhmediev breathers and kuznetsov - ma solitons , and explore how these evolve in the left - handed transmission line . </S>"
