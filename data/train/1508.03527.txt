    "the study of the function of the brain is of primordial importance in neuroscience .",
    "several brain models have been studied so far that take into account higher level functions of the external stimulus and the behavioral response attributed to ensembles of neurons of cortical areas .",
    "if the brain learns by maximizing the mutual information between stimuli and response , or by updating the internal model of probabilities by using bayesian techniques , or by minimizing the free - energy , it provides little insight about the dynamical mechanisms appearing in brain networks when evolved based on such principles . in our work",
    "we propose a working hypothesis supported by numerical simulations that brain dynamical networks evolve based on the principle of the maximization of their internal information flow capacity , i.e. the upper bound for the information transferred per time unit between any two nodes .",
    "we make a strong case to verify our hypothesis by showing that the neural networks with the closest spectral graph distance to the brain networks of _ caenorhabditis elegans _ and humans are the hindmarsh - rose neural networks evolved with coupling strengths that maximize information flow capacity .",
    "we also find that synchronous behavior and capacity of information flow of the evolved neural networks reproduce well the same behaviors observed in the brain dynamical networks of _ caenorhabditis elegans _ and humans .",
    "finally , we find that global neural synchronization levels decrease during brain network evolution .",
    "a plethora of phenomena in nature can be effectively described by networks .",
    "neuroscientists have used tools for the analysis of complex networks that help realize even more deeply the functionality and structure of the brain .",
    "it was found that many aspects of brain network structures are typical of a wide range of non - neural or non - biological complex networks @xcite .",
    "one of the main findings in neuroscience is the modular organization of the brain , which in turn implies an inherent parallel nature of brain computations @xcite .",
    "modular processors have to be sufficiently isolated and dynamically differentiated to achieve independent computations , but also globally connected to be integrated in coherent functions @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed that the cortical network is a hierarchical and clustered network with a complex connectivity @xcite .",
    "a possible network description for this modular organization is that brain networks may be small - world structured @xcite with properties similar to many other complex networks @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint has been driven by the systematic finding of small - world topology in a wide range of human brain networks derived from structural @xcite , functional @xcite , and diffusion tensor mri @xcite studies .",
    "small - world topology has also been identified at the cellular - network scale in functional cortical neural circuits in mammals @xcite and also in the nervous system of the nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _ ( _ c.elegans _ ) @xcite . moreover",
    ", this topology seems to be relevant for the brain function because it is affected by diseases @xcite , normal ageing , and by pharmacological blockade of dopamine neurotransmission @xcite .",
    "synchronization is ubiquitous in nature .",
    "insightful findings regarding synchronization in complex networks were reviewed recently in ref .",
    "recently , synchronization in complex modular or clustered networks has been investigated @xcite .",
    "it appears as the interplay between the intrinsic dynamics associated to the nodes of the network and its graph topology and connecting functions . in this work",
    ", synchronization will be considered as a mean to quantify functional behaviors of the brain dynamical networks ( bdns ) studied . by bdn",
    "we mean a network that represents the connectome equipped with neural dynamics for its nodes to account for their time evolution .",
    "mathematical and computational approaches have a long tradition traced back to the early mathematical theories of perception @xcite and of current integration by a neural cell membrane @xcite .",
    "hebb s idea on assembly formation @xcite inspired simulations on the largest computers available at that time ( 1956 ) @xcite to understand the relation between neural connectivity strength and response , i.e. behavior .",
    "it is a learning rule which proposes an explanation for the adaptation of neurons during the learning process .",
    "the simultaneous activation of pairs of neurons leads to pronounced increases in their synaptic strength .",
    "there is also the possibility of many other kinds of learning @xcite . in this work",
    "we find evidence of hebbian - like and no hebbian - like learning rules characterized by the relationship between the addition of synapses and the increase or decay in the synchronization behavior of neurons in the evolved bdns .",
    "several brain models have been studied so far that do not take into account particular behaviors of isolated neurons , but higher level functions of the external stimulus and the behavioral response attributed to ensembles of neurons of cortical areas .",
    "there are two classes : those based on collective functional dynamics of local groups of neurons , such as the wilson - cowan model for the cortical and thalamic nervous tissue @xcite , and those based on the conditional probabilities ( as well as information and mutual information ( mi ) ) of stimuli and responses , prominent examples of which are the bayesian brain hypothesis @xcite and the infomax theory @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that most of the probabilistic brain models can be unified under a single free - energy principle @xcite , the one that interprets the brain as a system that tries to minimize surprises of the sensations from the world .",
    "if the brain learns by maximizing the mi between stimuli and response @xcite , or by updating the internal model of probabilities by using bayesian techniques @xcite , or by minimizing the free - energy @xcite , the surprise of the response provides little insight about the dynamical mechanisms appearing in a brain network when it evolves based on such principles .",
    "the drawback however of the probabilistic brain models is that they describe little about the underlying dynamical structure of what is really happening in the neural level and the representation of the stimuli @xcite .    for deterministic systems with correlations ,",
    "an appropriate quantity for measuring the transfer of information is the mutual information rate ( mir ) , the mi per time unit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have developed alternative methods to overcome problems that stem from the definition of probabilities from time series and derived an upper bound for the mir , @xmath0 , between two nodes of a complex dynamical network from time averages that do not rely on probabilities , but instead on the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath1 , @xmath2 of the subspace of the network formed by the two nodes ( see eq . in materials and methods ) . in our study , @xmath0 stands for the upper bound for the information transferred per time unit between any two nodes of the bdn , what represents the information flow capacity of the bdn .",
    "we discuss more on these in materials and methods , section upper bound for mir .    inspired by the infomax theory and by theoretical studies that proposes that the maximization of information transmission between subsystems can be used as a principle for understanding the development and evolution of complex brain networks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , aiming at elucidating the microscopic dynamic mechanisms associated to the evolution of brain networks , we propose a working hypothesis and , provide evidence that a brain dynamical network may evolve based on the maximization of the information flow capacity it can internally handle at each step of its evolution process , i.e. a new inter - neuron connection is established if it leads to a subsequent increase of the information flow capacity of the new brain circuitry .",
    "our hypothesis is based on the internal neural network dynamics and on a plausible model for brain structure _ per se _ without the need to resort to probabilistic models based on the external influence in the brain and its response .",
    "we have been able to show that our evolved bdns present similar synchronization and information flow capacity behaviors with those found for the simulated dynamical networks for the brain structure of the _ c.elegans _ and humans .",
    "moreover , we show that bdns evolved with coupling strengths that maximize the information flow capacity are the ones with the smallest spectral graph distance from the bdns of the _ c.elegans _ and humans , and that , during the growing process , their information flow capacity increase is related to moderately low amounts of global neural synchronization .",
    "this work provides ample evidence that brain networks may grow by maximizing the capacity of information flow they can internally handle , driven by global no hebbian - like evolution processes , according to which the addition of interconnections between clusters during the evolution process leads to a decrease in the global synchronization level of the bdn .",
    "this behavior is accompanied by a similar no hebbian - like learning process for neurons in some of the clusters and by hebbian - like processes for neurons in the remaining clusters , leading to an increase in the synchronization level between these neurons during brain network evolution .",
    "effectively , the no hebbian - like mechanism is _ akin _ to the unlearning anti - hebbian mechanism of crick and mitchison @xcite that refers to the elimination of unnecessary connections to prevent overload and to render the network more efficient . in our evolution",
    "we do not delete links . however , both mechanisms lead to a decrease of synchronization and to more efficient networks , being in our case the evolved networks able to maximize their information flow capacity .",
    "global synchronization takes into consideration the synchronous behavior of all neurons in the bdn whereas local synchronization of neurons in a cluster of the bdns .",
    "finally , our work shows that optimizing information flow capacity leads to evolved networks that are heterogeneous , in accordance with the line of research in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors report on a mathematical model for the evolution of heterogeneous modules in the brain based on the maximization of bidirectional information flow transmission .",
    "in this work we are interested in understanding the relation between synchronization and information flow capacity in bdns constructed by connecting electrically and chemically , hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) neurons ( see materials and methods , subsection hindmarsh - rose neural model for brain dynamics ) .",
    "their topologies are given by the _",
    "c.elegans _ and human brain networks , and those that are the result of an evolutionary process that maximizes @xmath0 based on interconnected small - world communities .",
    "our intention is not to strictly model the _",
    "c.elegans _ and human brain neural dynamics but merely to use the topology of their connectomes to study the corresponding dynamic brain networks and to compare between the results obtained from these cases . in the following",
    ", global synchronization measurement ( denoted by @xmath3 ) quantifies the synchronous behavior of all neurons of the network whereas local synchronization ( denoted by @xmath4 ) quantifies the amount of synchronization between ensembles of neurons forming the @xmath5-th cluster within the bdn .",

    "the distance function depends on the scaling of the axes , meaning that different scales result in different distances .",
    "therefore , it is not an invariant distance measure between two networks but only serves as a tool to underpin the visual results in a quantitative manner .    to generalize the important relation between function and structure in bdns , we plot in panels ( c ) to ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral_distances ] the results of a similar study for one realization of a double - sized model for brain network evolution based on 120 hr coupled neurons arranged in six small - world clusters . panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the parameter spaces for the global synchronization @xmath3 and information flow capacity mmir of the big bdn which reproduce well the behavior of the small version of the model for brain network evolution of fig .",

    "again , couplings that promote low global neural synchronization and high information flow capacity give rise to the biggest possible spectral similarity of the double - sized brain network evolution model with the _ c.elegans _ and human brain networks , the same conclusion drawn for the small version of the same model !",
    "we therefore verify our hypothesis that finally evolved bdns with neurons that can potentially exchange the highest levels of information are the bdns with topologies closer to the brain networks of the _ c.elegans _ and humans .",
    "in this paper we propose a working hypothesis , and provide evidence , that neural networks that evolve based on the principle of the maximization of their internal information flow capabilities produce networks whose functional behavior and topology are similar to those features observed in dynamical neural networks whose topology is provided by the _",
    "c.elegans _ and humans .",
    "our hypothesis goes along the lines of the infomax theory that proposes that the brain evolves by maximizing the mutual information between external stimuli and its response .",
    "when maximizing the internal information flow capacity , we are creating a network capable of processing information about external stimuli for which its information content is smaller than the information flow capacity of the evolved network .",
    "notably , the brain evolves by the action of input signals .",
    "our working hypothesis simplifies enormously the complexity of the involved calculations and , allow us to understand function and behavior in the brain , without the need to externally perturb non - autonomous neural networks .",
    "we have been able to show that our evolved brain networks present similar synchronization and information flow capacity behaviors with the ones found for the simulated dynamical networks for the structure of the _ c.elegans _ and human brain .",
    "moreover , we have shown that bdns evolved with coupling strengths that maximize the information flow capacity are the ones that have the smallest spectral graph distance from the bdns of the _ c.elegans _ and humans , and that , during the growing process , their mir increase is related to moderately low amounts of global neural synchronization .",
    "actually , the global neural synchronization levels decrease during brain network evolution , revealing an underlying global no hebbian - like evolution process ( where synapse strength leads to global decay of synchronization ) driven by a mix of local no hebbian - like learning rules for neurons in some clusters and by hebbian - like learning rules in neurons belonging to other clusters where synapse strength leads to cluster synchronization . in this context , the no hebbian - like mechanism is effectively similar to the unlearning anti - hebbian mechanism as both lead to more efficient networks , in the sense that in our case the evolved networks are able to maximize their information flow capacity .",
    "we note that if other models than hindmarsh - rose will be used , such as the morris - lecar , izhikevich , or spiking map - based neural models , then the parameter regions that maximize information flow capacity and minimize synchronization ( or vice versa ) will be different , however we expect that this would not change the main results and conclusions of this work in the sense that brain network evolution based on the maximization of information flow capacity will lead to similar topologies , behaviors and relations for the evolved networks . for the human subjects ,",
    "the graphs represent functionally connected brain regions .",
    "the wilson - cowan model could be appropriate to model the human brain , whereas it will not be suitable to model the _",
    "c.elegans _ brain . as we have done here , using neurons to represent nodes in the human connectome",
    "do not reproduce the real dynamics of the brain but gives us a mean to compare results with the _ c.elegans _ and the evolved networks .    in relation to our work",
    ", the maximization of the information flow capacity for low synchronization corresponds to the critical point of the dynamics in which self - critical phenomena occur when the second or larger lyapunov exponents of the bdns are marginally positive .",
    "finally , our results support further the hypothesis made in ref .",

    "<S> we propose a working hypothesis supported by numerical simulations that brain networks evolve based on the principle of the maximization of their internal information flow capacity . we find that synchronous behavior and capacity of information flow of the evolved networks reproduce well the same behaviors observed in the brain dynamical networks of _ caenorhabditis elegans _ and humans , networks of hindmarsh - rose neurons with graphs given by these brain networks . </S>",
    "<S> we make a strong case to verify our hypothesis by showing that the neural networks with the closest graph distance to the brain networks of _ caenorhabditis elegans _ and humans are the hindmarsh - rose neural networks evolved with coupling strengths that maximize information flow capacity . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that global neural synchronization levels decrease during brain evolution , reflecting on an underlying global no hebbian - like evolution process , which is driven by no hebbian - like learning behaviors for some of the clusters during evolution , and hebbian - like learning rules for clusters where neurons increase their synchronization . </S>"
