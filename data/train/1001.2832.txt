    "the development of high - order schemes has been receiving an increasing amount of attention from practitioners in the fields of fluid dynamics and , only more recently , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "this interest is driven by a variety of reasons , such as the possibility of obtaining highly accurate solutions with reduced computational effort as well as the need to narrow the gap between the smallest resolved features and the dissipative scales .",
    "although several successful strategies have been developed in the context of the euler equations of gasdynamics , only few of them have been extended to mhd . in the present context ,",
    "we focus our attention on high - order finite difference schemes for the solution of the compressible mhd equations in multiple spatial dimensions , @xmath0 & = & 0\\,,\\\\ \\noalign{\\medskip } { \\displaystyle}{\\frac{\\partial { \\mathbf{b}}}{\\partial t } } - \\nabla\\times\\left({\\mathbf{v}}\\times{\\mathbf{b}}\\right )      & = & 0\\,,\\\\ \\noalign{\\medskip } { \\displaystyle}{\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t } } + \\nabla\\cdot\\left [    \\left(e + p + \\frac{{\\mathbf{b}}^2}{2}\\right){\\mathbf{v } } -     \\left({\\mathbf{v}}\\cdot{\\mathbf{b}}\\right){\\mathbf{b}}\\right ] & = & 0\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the fluid density , velocity vector , magnetic induction , energy and gas pressure , respectively . the system of equations ( [ eq : mhd ] ) is complemented by the divergence - free constraint of the magnetic field , @xmath6 and by an equation of state relating energy and pressures . for the present work we assume an ideal gas law @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "traditional second - order schemes have been largely employed for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhd ] ) using either finite volume ( fv , e.g. , @xcite ) or finite difference ( fd , e.g. , @xcite ) methods . at the second - order level , the two approaches are essentially equivalent and popular schemes have been built on godunov - type discretizations based on the total variation diminishing ( tvd , @xcite ) property making use of slope - limited reconstructions . in spite of the excellent results produced in proximity of discontinuous waves where sharp non - oscillatory transitions can be obtained , tvd schemes still suffer from excessive unwanted numerical dissipation in regions of smooth flow .",
    "this deficiency owes to the inherent behavior of tvd methods that reduces the order of accuracy to first - order near local extrema ( clipping ) and smear linearly degenerate fields ( such as contact waves ) much more than shocks .",
    "furthermore , discretization errors are mainly responsible for the loss of accuracy .",
    "efforts to relax the tvd condition and overcome these limitations have been spent over the last decades towards the development of highly accurate schemes that retain the robustness common to second - order godunov - type methods . the original piecewise parabolic method ( ppm )",
    "method by @xcite , for example , provides fourth - order accurate interface values in smooth regions ( in 1d ) and has been extended to mhd by @xcite and , more recently by @xcite .",
    "ppm , however , still degenerates to first - order at smooth extrema and attempts to solve the problem have been recently presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on a different approach , weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno , @xcite ) schemes have improved on their eno predecessor ( originally proposed by harten et al .",
    "@xcite ) and are now considered a powerful and effective tool for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations .",
    "weno methods provide highly accurate solutions in regions of smooth flow and non - oscillatory transitions in presence of discontinuous waves by combining different interpolation stencils of order @xmath9 into a weighted average of order @xmath10 .",
    "the nonlinear weights are adjusted by the local smoothness of the solution so that essentially zero weights are given to non smooth stencils while optimal weights are prescribed in smooth regions .",
    "weno scheme have been formulated in the context of mhd using both fd @xcite and fv formulations , @xcite . third- and fifth - order weno schemes have been recently improved in terms of reduced dissipation , better resolution properties and faster convergence rates ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and will be considered here .    an alternative strategy is followed by the monotonicity preserving ( mp ) family of schemes by suresh & huynh @xcite who proposed to carry the reconstruction step by first computing an accurate and stable interface value and then by imposing monotonicity- and accuracy - preserving constraints to limit the original value .",
    "mp schemes have been successfully merged with weno methods by @xcite and employed in the context of relativistic mhd by @xcite .    finally , a reconstruction procedure that avoids the clipping phenomenon has been recently discussed by ada & torrilhon @xcite who devised a new class of nonlinear limiter functions based upon a non - polynomial reconstruction showing good shape - preserving properties .",
    "it is important to point out that , for spatial accuracy higher than two , multidimensional fv schemes become notoriously more elaborate than their fd counterparts , since point values can no longer be interchanged with volume averages . as a result",
    ", fv schemes generally require fully multidimensional reconstructions and the solution of several riemann problems at a zone face providing the necessary number of quadrature points required by the desired level of accuracy , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "however , fv algorithms do have the adventage that they are better suited to non - uniform grids and adaptive mesh hierarchies .",
    "high - order fv schemes have been recently ameliorated in the work of @xcite using either ader - weno schemes or least - squares polynomial reconstruction .",
    "conversely , multidimensional fd schemes evolve the point values of the conserved quantities and considerably ease up the coding efforts by restricting the computations of flux derivatives to one dimensional stencils . in this perspective",
    ", we present a new class of fd numerical schemes adopting a point - wise , cell - centered formulation of all of the flow quantities , including magnetic fields .",
    "the proposed schemes have order of accuracy three and five and their performance is compared through extensive testing on two and three - dimensional problems .",

    "the solenoidal constraint of the magnetic field is controlled by extending the hyperbolic / parabolic divergence cleaning technique of dedner et al .",
    "@xcite to fd schemes .",
    "this avoids the computational cost associated with an elliptic cleaning step as in @xcite , and the scrupulous treatment of staggered fields demanded by constrained transport algorithms , e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mignone & tzeferacos @xcite have shown through extensive testing , for a class of second - order accurate schemes , that the glm approach is robust and can achieve accuracy comparable to the constrained transport .",
    "the resulting class of schemes is explicit and fully conservative in mass , momentum , magnetic induction and energy .",
    "besides the ease of implementation and efficiency issues , the benefits offered by a method where all of the primary flow variables are placed at the same spatial position ease the task to add more complex physics .",
    "the comparison between the different methods of solution is conveniently handled using the pluto code for computational astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : eqns ] we describe the glm - mhd equations , while  [ sec : numscheme ] shows the finite difference formulation and the selected reconstruction methods . in  [ sec : numtest ] we test and compare the different scheme performance on problems involving the propagation of both continuous and discontinuous features .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we look at a conservative discretization of the mhd equations ( [ eq : mhd ] ) where all fluid variables retain a cell - centered collocation and enforce the divergence - free condition through the hyperbolic / parabolic divergence cleaning technique of dedner s @xcite . in this approach",
    "gauss s and faraday s laws of magnetism are modified by the introduction of a new scalar field function or generalized lagrangian multiplier ( glm henceforth ) @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting system of glm - mhd equations then reads @xmath12 with conservative state vector @xmath13 and fluxes @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 labels the different components while @xmath17 is the delta kronecker symbol .",
    "equations ( [ eq : glm_mhd ] ) are hyperbolic and fully conservative with the only exception of the unphysical scalar field @xmath11 which satisfies a non - homogeneous equation with a source term . in the glm approach ,",
    "divergence errors are propagated to the domain boundaries at finite speed @xmath18 and damped at a rate given by @xmath19 ( see  [ sec : eqns ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the mhd flux jacobians @xmath20 are all real and coincide with the ordinary mhd waves plus two additional modes @xmath21 , for a total of @xmath22 characteristic waves . restricting our attention to the @xmath23 direction ,",
    "they are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the fast magneto - sonic ( @xmath26 with the @xmath27 sign ) , slow magneto - sonic ( @xmath28 with the @xmath29 sign ) and alfvn velocities .",
    "the two additional modes @xmath21 are decoupled from the remaining ones and corresponds to linear waves carrying jumps in @xmath30 and @xmath11 .",
    "these waves are made to propagate at the maximum signal speed compatible with the time step , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the fast magneto - sonic speeds in the three directions and the maximum is taken throughout the domain .",
    "owing to the decoupling , one can treat the @xmath33 linear system given by the longitudinal component of the field @xmath34 and @xmath11 separately from the other ordinary @xmath35-wave mhd equations .",
    "as we shall see , this greatly simplifies the solution process and allows to use the standard characteristic decomposition of the mhd equations .",
    "following @xcite , we divide the solution process into an homogeneous step , where the glm - mhd ( [ eq : glm_mhd ] ) are solved with @xmath36 , and a source step , where integration is done analytically : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the minimum grid size .",
    "extensive numerical testing has shown that divergence errors are minimized when the parameter @xmath39 lies in the range @xmath40 $ ] depending on the particular problem , although in presence of smooth flows this choice seems to be less sensitive to the numerical value of @xmath39 .",
    "we consider a conservative finite difference discretization of ( [ eq : glm_mhd ] ) where point - values rather than volume averages are evolved in time .",
    "a uniform cartesian mesh is employed with cell sizes @xmath41 centered at @xmath42 , where @xmath43 label the computational zones in the three directions . for clarity of exposition",
    ", we disregard the integer subscripts when redundant but always keep the half increment index notation when referring to a cell boundary , e.g. , @xmath44 .",
    "integration in time resorts to a semi - discrete formulation where , given a high - order numerical approximation @xmath45 to the derivatives appearing on the right hand side of eq .",

    "since the time step is proportional to the mesh size , the overall accuracy of the scheme is restricted to third - order because of the time - stepping introduced in eq .",

    "alternatively , one could use a directionally split formalism to obtain the solution through a sequence of one dimensional problems separately corresponding to each term in equation ( [ eq : l ] ) .    in order to ensure robustness and to avoid the appearance of spurious oscillations ,",
