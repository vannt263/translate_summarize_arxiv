    "non - equilibrium phase transitions have been gaining interests in recent years @xcite .",
    "whereas theoretical models can be organised in well - studied universality classes , the interpretation of experimental realisations is always more challenging , due to the inherent complexity of an experimental set - up compared to the simplicity of theoretical models . in this respect ,",
    "the experimental study by pine and coworkers @xcite of a relatively simple driven suspension of non - brownian particles displaying an apparent continuous phase transition towards an absorbing state offered a very promising new path for studying experimentally non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite . in the original work",
    "@xcite , the authors studied a colloidal suspension driven out of equilibrium by shearing the system periodically with some frequency @xmath0 and a maximum shear amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "it has been found that below some critical shear amplitude @xmath2 ( which depends on the volume fraction @xmath3 ) , the system evolves into an absorbing state in which all particles move reversibly in response to the external periodic shear . in other words , when observed stroboscopically , single - particle motion appears to be frozen and thus the diffusion constant @xmath4 is zero . on the other hand above the critical shear amplitude @xmath2",
    ", the particle motion becomes irreversible and appears diffusive at long times from stroboscopic images .",
    "this qualitative transformation was suggested to correspond to an nonequilibrium phase transition from an absorbing reversible state with @xmath5 to an irreversible diffusive phase with @xmath6 , and the results were compatible with a continuous phase transition  @xcite .",
    "interestingly at high density ( not considered in this paper ) , such transitions have also been suggested to be associated with plastic yielding @xcite .",
    "crucially , these colloidal particles are suspended in a very viscous solvent such that thermal effect is negligible over the duration of the experiment .",
    "the origin of irreversibility was , in fact , attributed to collisions between the particles provoked by the shear flow  @xcite . from this interpretation ,",
    "cort _ et al .",
    "_ then constructed a simple numerical model for their experiment on sheared non - brownian suspensions , where microscopic irreversibility upon collisions in the real system is converted into a stochastic rule for binary collisions in the theoretical model  @xcite .",
    "( long range hydrodynamic interactions were shown to play little role @xcite . )",
    "however , it has also been suggested by several authors @xcite that the onset of irreversibility could be due to chaotic motion of the particles rather than a nonequilibrium phase transition . in other words ,",
    "macroscopic irreversibility could arise when the lyapunov exponent is larger than some threshold without any diverging lengthscales or timescales .",
    "therefore further experimental studies are necessary to show if there is , in fact , any diverging lengthscale in such systems .",
    "while both scenario may coexist in the original experiment , we have recently suggested a number of possible experimental measurements that should be able to determine the main source of the irreversibility transition observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the experimental suggestions we made were based on the demonstration that a simpler version of the model by cort _",
    "_ displays a large number of experimentally accessible signatures of the criticality associated to the phase transition to an absorbing state . in the present paper",
    ", we provide a very extensive numerical study of this simplified model , which differs from the original one by the fact that stochastic rules for binary collisions are made isotropic  @xcite .",
    "this small change in the definition allows us to characterise more accurately the critical properties of the system , which are not yet fully resolved .",
    "it has been initially suggested by menon and ramaswamy @xcite that such periodically driven systems may belong to the universality class of conserved directed percolation ( cdp ) .",
    "the conserved quantity , in this case , refers to the total number of particles .",
    "however up to date , there has been no accurate measurements of the critical exponents which may suggest a cdp universality class .",
    "for instance , the critical exponent for the order parameter @xmath7 is defined to be : @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "different values of @xmath7 have been reported in both experimental and numerical studies of bidimensional periodically sheared suspensions : @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite . however from these values of @xmath7 ,",
    "we are still unable to determine if the system belongs to the conserved directed percolation ( cdp ) or directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "the value of @xmath7 in dp is @xmath16 and in cdp is @xmath17 for 2d systems @xcite . is to accurately measure @xmath7 as well as other critical exponents discussed below , to more",
    "precisely characterize the universality class of the model .",
    "another frequently measured quantity is a timescale @xmath18 which diverges close to criticality with a power law : @xmath19 .",
    "the timescale @xmath18 , for instance , can be defined as the timescale for the system to reach a steady state  @xcite .",
    "this timescale has been measured in the literature giving varying values of the critical exponents : @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath23 @xcite ( all are in 2d ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce four other ways of measuring @xmath18 independently .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that the results of these measurements are consistent to each other , giving the same critical exponent @xmath24 .",
    "another important critical exponent is associated with the diverging lengthscale : @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xmath26 has not yet been measured in literature . in this paper , both static and dynamic correlation lengths @xmath27",
    "are carefully studied for the first time and characterised quantitatively . in particular",
    ", they are both shown to diverge close to criticality with the same exponent @xmath26 .",
    "a related critical exponent is the one of the susceptibility @xmath28 which quantifies the variance of the global fluctuations of the order parameter , and obyes @xmath29 .",
    "again , the exponent @xmath30 has , to our knowledge , not been measured before ,    thus both our model and the one introduced by cort _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show a true dynamical phase transition from an irreversible to a reversible phase accompanied by diverging timescales , lengthscales and global fluctuations . by simultaneously measuring all critical exponents using various methods that appear to be internally consistent ,",
    "we find these values to be consistent with both directed percolation ( dp ) and conserved directed percolation ( cdp / manna ) universality class after appropriate finite size scaling .",
    "we emphasize that both universality classes share critical exponents that are very close to one another and are hard to distinguish numerically .",
    "our results seem to favor the dp universality class , despite the presence of particle conservation , which is generally viewed as the key ingredient responsible for the emergence of the cdp universality class  @xcite .",
    "we discuss this finding more extensively in the conclusion of the article .",
    "additionally , our simplified model also shows a true hyperuniformity at criticality , consistent to the conventional shear - based cort model  @xcite , which we show by a diverging hyperuniform lengthscale approaching criticality , as determined experimentally very recently  @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that this hyperuniform lengthscale is apparently unrelated to other critical lengthscales in the model .",
    "finally , we shall also point out a similarity between the dynamic criticality displayed in periodically driven systems near an irreversibility transition and dense liquids near a glass transition @xcite .",
    "we will show that both types systems exhibit a very heterogenous dynamics in space and time ( which becomes critical at the reversible - irreversible transition ) .",
    "we find in particular that single - particle dynamics becomes intermittent and strongly non - fickian , and that collective dynamics becomes spatially correlated over diverging lengthscales .",
    "the analogy between the two types of systems suggests that particle - based measurements and observables developed for glassy materials could prove useful in driven suspensions .",
    "these tools could in particular reveal whether the ` singularity - free ' explanation based on the lyapunov instability is experimentally relevant , as no special critical feature should appear in this case .",
