    "the understanding of the energy behaviour of total cross - sections in hadron and photon scattering is still an unresolved challenge . in our opinion ,",
    "the major problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "the simplest and most successful parametrization of the total cross - section for proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering @xcite follows from the optical theorem and describes the initial fall through the exchange of regge trajectories , i.e. @xmath0 with @xmath1 and the rise as due to pomeron exchange , i.e. @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "although successful , this parametrization violates the froissart bound on total cross - sections , established long time ago @xcite , namely that @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "other parametrizations have then been proposed , which are based on purely phenomenological grounds , but as such do not really give an insight into the mechanisms of the rise of total cross - sections . in another vein , there are the eikonal models which use the impact parameter distribution of protons , often derived from the fourier trasform of the proton form factor , and a basic scattering cross - sections @xcite . among them",
    "is the eikonal mini - jet model in which the term which drives the rise is a perturbatively calculated qcd jet cross - section .",
    "our proposal is to use this eikonal mini - jet model with an impact parameter factor derived from the fourier transform of the initial transverse momentum distribution of valence quarks in the proton , calculated through soft gluon resummation .",
    "this distribution is energy dependent and produces a saturation mechanism which quenches the mini - jet rise in such a way that one restores the froissart bound . in the following",
    "we shall first describe the soft gluon transverse momentum distribution , then the eikonal mini - jet model and its application to the proton cross - sections .",
    "we shall then show how this model for total cross - sections , in the very large asymptotic regime , and with a particular anstz for the zero momentum modes of the emitted soft gluons , satisfies the froissart bound .",
    "soft gluon emission from the initial quarks and gluons introduces an acollinearity between the initial partons .",
    "such acollinearity is energy dependent , and can be responsible for reducing the fast rise of the mini - jet cross - section @xcite .",
    "we have described this effect in a number of papers , here we first discuss in detail the main characteristics of the soft gluon resummed transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the emission of an infinite number of low momentum massless quanta results in a four momentum distribution @xmath6 with @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the average number of soft quanta , gluons or photons , emitted by a color or electrically charged source . upon integrating on the energy and longitudinal momentum variable",
    ", one obtains the well known transverse momentum distribution @xmath9 with @xmath10 \\label{softterm}\\ ] ] the above transverse momentum distribution does not admit a closed form solution , unlike the energy distribution in qed , which easily integrates to a power law function .",
    "this has led to various strategies to evaluate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ d2p ] ) , none of which is however fully satisfying , for reasons which we shall try to illustrate .",
    "indeed , while the importance of this function has been known for a long time , in our opinion such importance has not been fully exploited , and in this note we shall discuss this point and present our approach to the problem .",
    "the simplest case to examine is that of the low momentum soft quanta in an abelian gauge theory with a constant but not small coupling constant .",
    "it is then possible to make some simple approximations , as in @xcite , and obtain a closed form for the transverse momentum distribution , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the modified bessel function of third kind , @xmath13 is obtained by performing the angular integration over @xmath8 , e is the maximum energy allowed to the single soft quantum emitted and a is related to @xmath14 and defined so that the distribution is normalized to 1 .",
    "the above procedure fails in the non abelian case , where the strong coupling constant is large but not constant .",
    "this was included @xcite in the qcd versions of the transverse momentum distribution , still presently used in many phenomenological applications . using the asymptotic freedom expression for @xmath15 , the relative transverse momentum distribution induced by soft gluon emission from a pair of , initially collinear ,",
    "colliding partons is obtained , at lo , as @xmath16 - \\ln ( { \\frac{e } { \\mu } } ) } \\right\\ } \\end{centering}\\ ] ] where the integration only extends down to a scale @xmath17 . because of the cut - off @xmath17 , this expression fails to reproduce the entire range of low energy transverse momentum effects and an _ ad hoc _ constant , i.e. the intrinsic transverse momentum , is introduced for phenomenological applications .",
    "the problem we observe in the above use of this distribution is its limited applicability to minimum bias physics and its lack of connection to the question of confinement .",
    "our approach instead is to extend the integral over the soft gluon momentum down to zero modes ; propose an anstz for the behaviour of @xmath15 in the infrared region , and compare its consequences on measurable quantities such as the total cross - section . in the next section",
    ", we shall present one such phenomenological application through the calculation of total cross - sections and in the last section discuss the consequences of our anstz for the infrared soft gluon limit to the limitations imposed by the froissart bound on the total cross - section .",
    "recently we have obtained predictions for the total cross - section @xcite at lhc energies using a model based on hard component of scattering responsible for the rise of the total cross - section and soft gluon emission from scattering particles which softens the rise and gives the impact parameter distribution . in this model mini - jet events coming from parton - parton high energy collisions",
    "are responsible for the rise of the total cross - section . from perturbative qcd , we have the following expression for parton - parton cross section at high energy @xmath18 which depends on the minimum transverse momentum allowed to the scattered partons in the final state , @xmath19 , @xmath20 gev .",
    "this parameter represents the energy scale which distinguishes hard processes from the soft ones .",
    "evaluating the mini - jet cross - sections using different lo parametrizations available for the partonic density functions @xmath21 @xcite , we obtain a growth of @xmath22 with energy as a ( small ) power of s. soft gluon emission changes the parton collinearity and contributes in softening the rise of the total cross section . the average number of soft gluon emissions increases with energy , with more emission leading to more acollinearity between colliding partons and less energy available for mini - jet production .",
    "these processes are best studied through an impact parameter ( b-)distribution . the overlap function which describes the b - distribution of the incident partons in our model is @xmath23 with @xmath24\\ ] ] similar to the one obtained in the first section , but for the fact that the integral extends down to zero momentum and @xmath25 needs to be retained for infrared finiteness . for @xmath15",
    "we use a phenomenological expression , which coincides with the usual qcd limit for large @xmath26 , but is singular for @xmath27 , namely @xmath28}}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 for the integral over @xmath26 to exist and @xmath30 for the correct analyticity in the momentum transfer variable .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is linked by kinematics to the maximum transverse momentum allowed to single soft gluon emission in a given hard collision , and for this purpose , we use an expression averaged over all the parton densities@xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the use of eikonal representation allows us to consider multiple scatterings . neglecting the real part of the eikonal function , the expression for the total cross section is given by @xmath34\\ ] ] with @xmath35 denoting the average number of partonic collisions during the scattering .",
    "the hard term is evaluated using the expressions ( [ sjet ] ) and ( [ overlap ] ) for @xmath22 and @xmath36 , while the soft one has a phenomenological parametrization @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a parameter necessary to reproduce the right normalization of the total cross - section , while @xmath39 respectively for @xmath40 and @xmath41 scattering , @xmath42 parametrized as in @xcite",
    ".    from @xcite shows the range of values of the total cross - section produced with this model using a set of phenomenological values for the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and varying the parton densities .",

    "at very large energies , using the eikonal representation , the total cross - section in our model @xcite reads @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "we consider the asymptotic expression for @xmath22 at high energies , which grows as a power of @xmath47 : @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is obtained through soft gluon resummation as @xmath50 where @xmath51  is given by eq .",
    "( [ softterm ] ) . if we take now the limit @xmath27 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath29 , the integral ( [ softterm ] ) gives @xmath54 .",
    "this implies @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",

    "( recall that @xmath61 ) .",
    "we have shown how soft gluon resummation acts as a saturation mechanism in the rise of the total cross - section .",
