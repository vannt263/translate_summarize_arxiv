    "one of the main goals of a future international linear collider ( ilc ) is the precise measurement of the top quark threshold .",
    "next to a precise extraction of the strong coupling an unrivaled determination of the top quark mass and its width is possible .",
    "this would open up a new chapter in the electroweak precision physics which leads to very strong checks of the standard model or possible extensions .",
    "the theoretical calculations are based on an effective theory  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) which enables the simultaneous expansion in the two small parameters present in threshold phenomena , the strong coupling @xmath0 and the velocity of the heavy quarks , @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , a resummation of correction terms like @xmath2 to all orders is possible in perturbation theory . in a first step",
    "the effective theory is constructed in a matching procedure where it is required that the green functions agree with the corresponding ones in full qcd in the limit of infinitely heavy top quark mass . in a second step",
    "the green function in the effective theory has to be evaluated leading to the desired cross section .",
    "experimental studies  @xcite have shown that an uncertainty of less than 3% is necessary for the theoretical predictions for the cross section of the reaction @xmath3 in the threshold region , i.e. for @xmath4  gev .",
    "this has not yet been achieved .",
    "as far as the strong coupling is concerned currently the analysis is complete to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )  @xcite demonstrating the urgent need for the third - order corrections .",
    "this huge enterprise has been started already some years ago and many building blocks have been evaluated starting from the determination of the third - order hamiltonian  @xcite , third - order corrections to the energy levels and wave functions  @xcite up to the evaluation of the contributions from the coulomb potential to the non - relativistic green function  @xcite .",
    "next to fixed - order corrections also the resummation of next - to - next - to leading logarithmic terms has been considered and quite some progress has been achieved  @xcite .    in order to reach a theory - uncertainty below 3% it is also necessary to worry about electroweak effects which can be parametrically as big as the third - order qcd terms .",
    "first results in this context are available  @xcite which show that indeed numerical effects in the region of a few percent are possible .    in this paper",
    "a further building block needed for the n@xmath5lo analysis is provided : the fermionic corrections to the matching coefficient of the vector current .",
    "more precisely we compute the three - loop contributions to the matching coefficient containing at least one closed loop of massless fermions which we enumerate by @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe in detail the theoretical framework and the methods used for the calculation . in particular , we classify the occurring integrals and discuss their evaluation .",
    "sections  [ sec::z2 ] and  [ sec::match ] contain a detailed discussion about the wave function and matching coefficient up to order @xmath7 , respectively . in section  [ sec::phen ]",
    "we briefly discuss the phenomenological impact of our result and section  [ sec::concl ] contains our conclusions and outlook . in the appendix a complete list of master integrals is provided  both for the `` natural '' and the @xmath8-finite basis .",
    "the matching coefficient establishing the relation between the quark current in the full and effective theory constitutes a building block for all threshold phenomena involving the coupling of a photon or @xmath9 boson to heavy quarks .",
    "we define the currents through @xmath10 and generically denote the heavy quark by @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are two - component pauli spinors for quark and anti - quark , respectively .",
    "the definition of the matching coefficient is established through @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the spacial components .",
    "@xmath16 contains the space - like components of the gauge - covariant derivative involving the gluon fields and the ellipsis stand for operators of higher mass dimension . the second term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_of_cv ] ) is already of nnlo with @xmath17 .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 may be expressed as series in @xmath0 and represent the contributions from the hard modes which have been integrated out in order to arrive at the effective theory .",
    "note that both the higher order terms in the inverse heavy quark mass and the time - like component is not of interest for the aim of this paper .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the evaluation of the fermionic correction to the non - singlet contribution of @xmath18 containing at least one closed massless quark loop .",
    "the one - loop corrections to @xmath19 contain no contribution proportional to @xmath6 .    in order to compute @xmath18",
    "it is obvious to consider the @xmath20 vertex which in the following is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "this effectively transforms eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_of_cv ] ) into @xmath22 where we have on the left- and right - hand side quantities of the full and effective theory , respectively , and the ellipses denote terms suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy quark mass . in eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_cv ] ) it is understood that the couplings and masses in @xmath21 are renormalized .    since @xmath18 takes into account the degrees of freedom which have been integrated out from the full theory it depends in our case only on @xmath0 and  for dimensional reasons  on @xmath23 . in particular , @xmath18 does not explicitly depend on the momenta of the external particles .",
    "thus , it is useful to apply the so - called threshold expansion  @xcite to eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_cv ] ) which has the consequence that @xmath21 has to be evaluated for @xmath24 since all except the hard region cancel in eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_cv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , on the right - hand side only tree contributions have to be considered .",
    "in particular we have @xmath25 .",
    "starting from two - loop order the matching procedure exhibits infra - red divergences which are compensated by ultra - violet divergences of the effective theory rendering physical quantities finite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq::def_cv ] ) the renormalization constant @xmath26 which generates the anomalous dimension of @xmath27 takes over this part .",

    "=    sample feynman diagrams contributing to the one- , two- and three - loop fermionic part of @xmath18 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::sample ] . due to the special kinematic situation with @xmath28 and on - shell",
    "heavy quark lines it is possible to perform a partial fractioning in the integrands corresponding to the various types of diagrams and map all occurring integrals to one of the following functions : @xmath29 for convenience we have also listed the two - loop functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 originally defined in ref .",

    "the various topologies are identified with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite which also adapts the notation in order to match the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq::integrals ] ) .    in a next step",
    "the reduction of the various functions to so - called master integrals has to be achieved . for this step",
    "we have chosen two approaches : the laporta method  @xcite and baikov s method  @xcite in the formulation of  @xcite .",
    "the application of these methods reduces the three - loop integrals to twelve master integrals .",
    "since some of the master integrals are only known numerically it is very useful to construct a so - called @xmath8-finite basis  @xcite .",
    "details of this procedure and the results for the master integrals are given in appendix  [ masters ] .",
    "let us in the following provide more details on our implementation of each of the two reduction methods .",
    "the laporta algorithm is based on the integration - by - parts ( ibp ) relations  @xcite where in a first step a huge system of equations is created by inserting numerical integer values into the relations . after assigning a weight specifying the complexity to each occurring integral",
    "the system of equations is solved step - by - step . in this way",
    "an arbitrary integral is expressed in terms of master integrals which can not be further reduced .",
    "to date there is only one publicly available computer code , air  @xcite , where the laporta algorithm is implemented .",
    "we have successfully applied air to the two - loop diagrams . however , the three - loop integrals of eq .",
    "( [ eq::integrals ] ) can not be treated with the help of air .",
    "for this reason we have chosen to write a new implementation of laporta s algorithm , crusher  @xcite .",
    "it is written in c++ and uses ginac  @xcite for simple manipulations like taking derivatives of polynomial quantities .",
    "in the practical implementation of the laporta algorithm one of the most time - consuming operations is the simplification of the coefficients appearing in front of the individual integrals .",
    "this task is performed with the help of fermat  @xcite where a special interface has been used ( see ref .",
    "the main features of the implementation are the automated generation of the ibp identities and a complete symmetrization of the diagrams . using crusher we solved approximately forty million equations to reduce all integrals to master integrals .",
    "baikov s method is also based on the ibp relations . here",
    ", however , one explicitly constructs the coefficient functions of the master integrals as parametric integrals over some polynomial , which encodes the topology of the initial integral .",
    "the integrations can then be performed as cauchy integrations around the origin or as contour integrations between the roots of the polynomial .",
    "the results are rational functions depending on the dimension and the kinematical invariants .    in some cases , however , it is not possible to perform the integrations in this way . in these cases one has to solve the integration - by - parts relations for the parametric integrals .",
    "they are similar to the relations for the initial integral , however , they depend on less indices and are thus in general significantly simpler . since the relations can still be quite complicated , it is convenient to again use laporta s algorithm . in the current calculation",
    "the program air was used for this task .    in order to perform the calculations , the algorithms for each integral",
    "were implemented in form  @xcite . in a first step , however , everything was implemented in mathematica .",
    "this is very convenient since it is possible to produce almost all needed mathematica code automatically .",
    "once the program is finished , it can be easily translated to form and the mathematica version can be used for debugging .    the two - loop calculation was done entirely with this method . in the three - loop case , however , it turned out that a complete solution of the recurrence relations for the coefficient functions is not possible with air .",
    "the calculation was therefore done with the laporta method described above .",
    "we used baikov s method only for the @xmath43 part and to cross - check some of the coefficient functions .",
    "according to eq .  ( [ eq::def_cv ] ) the wave function renormalization constant in the on - shell scheme",

    "similarly as for the bottom quark case also for the top quark the perturbative series is alternating and the third - order coefficient tends to stabilize the expansion .",
