    "the random motions with finite velocity represent an alternative to diffusion models defined by means of stochastic differential equations .",
    "the prototype of these models is the telegraph process ( see goldstein , 1951 and kac , 1974 ) that describes the position of a particle moving on the real line , alternatively with constant velocity @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the changes of direction are governed by an homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath15 the telegraph process is defined by @xmath16 where the initial velocity @xmath17 assumes the values @xmath18 with equal probability and @xmath19 is the poisson process on @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we consider a particle initially located on the real line at point @xmath21 .",
    "the explicit conditional density function of the process @xmath0 has been obtained by orsingher ( 1990 ) and reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the modified bessel function with imaginary argument .",
    "note that the second term in equation represents the singular component of the distribution of , of the position of the particle at time @xmath26 . indeed , if no poisson events occur in the interval @xmath20 $ ] , we have that @xmath27 .",
    "many authors analyzed over the years the telegraph process , see for example orsingher ( 1985 , 1990 ) , foong and kanno ( 1994 ) , stadje and zacks ( 2004 ) . di crescenzo and pellerey ( 2002 ) proposed the geometric telegraph process as a model to describe the dynamics of the price of risky assets @xmath28 . in the black - scholes ( 1973 ) - merton ( 1973 ) model",
    "the process @xmath28 is described by means of geometric brownian motion @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath31 .",
    "di crescenzo and pellerey ( 2002 ) assume that @xmath28 evolves in time according to the following process @xmath32 where @xmath0 is the telegraph process . given",
    "that @xmath0 has bounded variation , so is @xmath28 in equation .",
    "this seems a realistic way to model paths of assets in the financial markets .",
    "mazza and rulliere ( 2004 ) linked the process and the ruin processes in the context of risk theory . di masi _",
    "et al _ ( 1994 ) propose to model the volatility of financial markets in terms of the telegraph process .",
    "ratanov ( 2004 , 2005 ) propose to model financial markets using a telegraph process with two intensities @xmath33 and two velocities @xmath34 .",
    "while such markets may admit an arbitrage opportunity , linking opportunity velocities and interest rates , the author proves that the market becomes arbitrage - free and complete .",
    "an analogous of the black and scholes equation is established as well .",
    "the aim of this paper is the estimation of the parameter @xmath7 when @xmath35 is observed at equidistant times @xmath36 ( and also @xmath37 for discrete observations from the process ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , hence @xmath40 .",
    "the asymptotic framework is the following : @xmath40 fixed and @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "sometimes we will use @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 to simplify the writing . when the telegraph process @xmath0 is observed",
    "continuously then @xmath45 is the optimal estimator of the parameter @xmath7 as this statistical problem will be equivalent to the one of the observation of the whole poisson process on @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this situation corresponds indeed to the limiting experiment in our asymptotic framework .",
    "this asymptotic framework is usually known as the `` high frequency '' scheme in the literature on estimation from discrete time observations of processes solution to stochastic differential equations of the form @xmath47 this field has been an active research area during the last twenty years .",
    "the reader can consult sorensen ( 2004 ) for a review on estimation techniques recently appeared in the literature since the seminal papers of le breton ( 1976 ) and florens - zmirou ( 1989 ) : e.g. estimating functions , analytical and numerical approximations of the likelihood function , mcmc methods , indirect inference , etc .",
    "unfortunately such methods are not directly applicable in our case because the telegraph process is not ergodic or stationary nor markovian .",
    "the main idea in the paper is to consider the observed increments of the process @xmath48 as @xmath12 copies of the telegraph process up to time @xmath43 and treat them as if they were independent ( which is untrue ) .",
    "from this idea we build an approximated likelihood and score function from which we derive estimators .",
    "we further propose least squares estimators .",
    "equations emerging in connection with the telegraph process are always complicated to treat and closed form results are quite rare in the literature .",
    "this also happens in our work , thus in some cases we rely on numerical simulations to study the properties of the estimators .",
    "it is worth mention that , up to our knowledge , the only references about estimation problems for the telegrapher s processes are yao ( 1985 ) and iacus ( 2001 ) .",
    "the first author considers a the problem of state estimation of the telegrapher s process under white noise perturbation and studies performance of nonlinear filters .",
    "the second paper is about the estimation of the parameter @xmath49 of the non - constant rate @xmath50 from continuous observations of the process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will introduce the approximating likelihood function @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined by .",
    "we will then study the asymptotic properties of estimator @xmath53 ( which is interpreted as an approximated maximum likelihood estimator ) and the properties of the estimator obtained on the approximated score function whose properties are easier to study , i.e. the quantity @xmath54 satisfying @xmath55 we also propose a least squares estimator for @xmath7 based on the second moment of the process @xmath0 . inference problems and estimators for the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath37 of the geometric telegrapher s process are considered in section [ sec : geo ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec3 ] contains a monte carlo analysis to study empirically the behavior of the estimators in a finite sample context ( i.e. non asymptotically ) .",
    "we assume that the telegraph process @xmath35 , with @xmath56 is observed only at discrete times @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , @xmath59 hence @xmath60 .",
    "we use the following notation to simplify the formulas : @xmath61 .",
    "the asymptotic is considered as @xmath12 tends to infinity under the conditions @xmath62 and @xmath60 .",
    "the interest is in the estimation of the parameter @xmath7 whilst @xmath63 is assumed to be known .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , if one can observe the whole trajectory , @xmath7 can be estimated as @xmath45 where @xmath64 is the number of times the process switches its velocity during the interval @xmath46 $ ] which is , of course , the number of poisson events counted in @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this is certainly the best estimator of @xmath7 and it is indeed our target .",
    "the estimation of @xmath63 is always an uninteresting problem as , if there are no switchings in @xmath65 $ ] then @xmath66 , hence if @xmath44 is sufficiently small , there is high probability of observing @xmath67 then @xmath63 can be estimated ( actually calculated ) without error .",
    "the process @xmath0 itself is not markovian . on the contrary",
    ", the two dimensional process @xmath68 has the markov property but a scheme of observation in which one is able to observe both the position and the velocity of the process at discrete time instants is not admissible , so we can rely only on the observation of the @xmath0 component .",
    "hence we can not write an explicit likelihood of the process in the form of a product of transition densities as , for example , for the case of diffusion processes .",
    "another unfortunate fact about the telegraph process is that it is not even stationary ( at the second order ) as @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see orsingher ( 1990 ) ) nor it posseses an ergodic property , so we can not use the same approach as proposed , e.g. , in sorensen ( 2000 ) .",
    "we then need an approximation argument as follows .      by taking into account the distribution , we approximate the likelihood of the process with the following function @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the density @xmath52 appearing in is the probability law of a telegraph process initially located in @xmath73 , that reaches the position @xmath74 at time @xmath75 . to build our approximation of the likelihood , we consider the observed increments @xmath76 as @xmath12 copies of the process @xmath77 ( i.e. the process @xmath0 up to time @xmath43 ) and we treat them as if they were independent .",
    "this is of course untrue , but results below show that our is not a bad idea .",
    "it is clear that is equivalent to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is equal to the number of approximating telegraph processes with at least one change of direction ( see figure 1 ) .    in the expression ,",
    "the factor @xmath80 concerns the singular part of the densities @xmath52 , while the product represents the absolutely continuous components of the distributions of the telegraph processes .",
    "note that for increasing values of @xmath7 , the absolutely continuous component of has a bigger weight than the discrete component ; viceversa for small values of @xmath7 this has consequences in the performance of the estimators as shown in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows how the two components of the function @xmath81 emerge for this scheme of observation .     and @xmath82",
    "no poisson event occurred with probability @xmath83 , hence the singular part of the approximated likelihood emerges in the @xmath81 .",
    "for this example trajectory @xmath84 and @xmath85 . ]      one estimator that can be derived from @xmath81 is the following quantity @xmath86 of course , @xmath87 is not a true maximum likelihood estimator as @xmath81 is not itself a true likelihood , nevertheless such estimators can be effective like in kessler ( 2000 ) but unfortunately , our model is not ergodic or stationary and the likelihood looks quite difficult to handle",
    ". nevertheless we are able to prove uniqueness of the estimator . on the contrary , it is not clear how to prove asymptotic properties of the estimator directly on as the term @xmath88 diverges in @xmath89 on the contrary the following estimating function @xmath90 is easier to study .",
    "the estimator in this case is the value @xmath54 solution of @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 and once again , we borrow the approach from the literature on estimating functions for discretely observed diffusion processes .",
    "the function is indeed more tractable and the asymptotic properties of the estimator @xmath54 can be studied as in the next theorem .",
    "we just note that , given the uniqueness of @xmath87 ( proved in theorem [ th : unique ] below ) , @xmath54 coincides with @xmath87 hence they share the same properties and they will be treated as one in table [ tab1 ] .    [ th2 ] under the condition @xmath40 as @xmath93 we have that @xmath94    * proof .",
    "* in order to prove we recall some properties of bessel s functions ( see e.g.  5.7 , lebedev , 1972 ) @xmath95 and @xmath96 direct differentiation of gives @xmath97 in the limit as @xmath98 we have , @xmath62 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore converges to @xmath102 @xmath103 + in light of theorem [ th2 ] we can say that in the high frequency observation scheme , the estimator @xmath104 tends to the best estimator of the intensity @xmath7 of an homogeneous poisson process .",
    "the estimator @xmath87 in is unique .",
    "[ th : unique ]    * proof . * to prove the result , we show that the second partial derivative of @xmath105 is negative . in view of the following property of bessels functions",
    "@xmath106 we have that @xmath107 therefore equation can be rewritten as @xmath108 differentiating again with respect to @xmath7 and posing @xmath109 to simplify the equations is strictly positive because it refers to the @xmath79 terms for which @xmath110 . ] , we obtain @xmath111 where the generic term @xmath112 is the sum of the following terms @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 recalling that @xmath117 , equation can be rewritten as @xmath118 summation of and gives @xmath119 putting together @xmath120 and equation it remains to study the sign of @xmath121 which is positive due to the fact that @xmath122 for positive @xmath123 ( from property ) .",
    "@xmath103 +      we already mentioned that the telegrapher s process is not stationary at the second order , but we can still think to use to obtain a least squares estimator on the mean of the squared increments in the following way . if , as before , we consider the observations @xmath124 as @xmath12 copies of the process @xmath77 , then looking at for @xmath125 we have @xmath126 consider now the sample second moment ( or the mean of the square ) of the observed increments @xmath76 @xmath127 then the following estimator can be considered @xmath128 this estimator will be compared numerically to the estimator @xmath54 in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "consider the process @xmath129 of the observed log - returns @xmath130 where @xmath131 are discrete observations from the geometric telegraph process .",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be known , which is usually the case in finance where @xmath3 is related to the expected return of non risky assets like bonds , etc .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath7 are to be estimated . as in the previous sections",
    ", we can assume @xmath63 to be known as well , if not we will show in the next paragraph a simple way to obtain it .",
    "we assume @xmath132 to be @xmath12 copies of the process @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , by , we have @xmath136 and by we obtain @xmath137 a good estimator of the volatility @xmath37 can be derived from the sample mean of the log returns . indeed , @xmath138 and @xmath139 again by and for the properties of the log - returns .",
    "from we have that @xmath140 from which the following unbiased estimator of @xmath141 can be derived @xmath142 therefore , a reasonable estimator of @xmath37 is @xmath143 which not always exists because there is no guarantee that @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that in practice , given @xmath3 , @xmath37 and @xmath43 the estimator essentially depends on the last value of the telegraph process @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , we can write in terms of the telegraph process @xmath146 therefore the estimate of @xmath37 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "this is why table [ tab4 ] reports the same value of the estimates for different sample sizes .",
    "we then use @xmath147 to estimate @xmath7 making use of .",
    "let @xmath148 then the proposed estimator of @xmath7 is @xmath149      if the velocity @xmath63 is not known one can proceed as follows : set @xmath150 hence an estimator of the increments of the telegraph process is @xmath151 then @xmath152 where @xmath153 are the estimated states of the underlying telegrapher s process . from these estimates , one can proceed as in previous sections and estimate both @xmath7 and @xmath63 .",
    "to assess the properties of the estimator and for fixed @xmath154 we run extensive monte carlo analysis .",
    "given that numerically @xmath87 and @xmath54 coincides , we treat them as one in the tables .",
    "we simulate 10000 trajectories of the telegrapher s process on the interval @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath155 , for different values of @xmath7 and with @xmath156 fixed .",
    "each trajectory has then been resampled on a regular grid of @xmath157 , 100 , 500 and 1000 points and the corresponding observations have been used to estimate the unknown parameter .",
    "the results have been collected in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it emerges that , as expected , the bias tends asymptotically to zero as well as the mean square error .",
    "furthermore , bias and variance are strictly correlated to the value of the unknown parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this is expected as well because , for fixed @xmath12 , as the more @xmath7 increases the more poisson events remain hidden to the observer .",
    "for the same experiment ( and on the same sample trajectories ) , table [ tab2 ] reports the performance on the least squares estimator @xmath158 from equation .",
    "tables [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] reports estimates results on the telegrapher s process respectively for the estimation of @xmath7 and @xmath37 .",
    "the paths of the geometric telegrapher s process have been generated from the ones of the telegrapher process of tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "as it can be seen , the estimator @xmath159 in table [ tab3 ] strongly depends on the quality of the estimate @xmath147 ( reported in table [ tab4 ] ) . for low values of @xmath7 , in some cases",
    "the condition for the existence of @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath144 , has not been fulfilled hence we report the percentage of valid paths over the 10000 simulated . for @xmath160",
    ", it seems that @xmath159 performs quite similarly to @xmath158 in terms of bias .",
    "this seems consistent with the definition of the estimators and the performance of the estimator @xmath147 .",
    "tables also report the column @xmath161 .",
    "values under this column are calculated , e.g. , as follows @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the number of monte carlo simulations ( @xmath164 in our case ) and @xmath12 is the fixed sample size .",

    "in particular , a detailed description of the law of the increments of the process of the log - returns might be of interest because , numerical evidence , show that these have heavy tails but their law do not need a high number of parameters like other distributions proposed in the literature ( see e.g. eberlain and keller , 1995 ) . moreover , the parameters have a direct interpretation as in the standard geometric brownian motion .",
