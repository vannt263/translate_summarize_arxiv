    "for consistency in the thermodynamic laws , it has become customary to treat ( some of ) the physical constants as thermodynamic variables  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "if the conjugate variable associated with the physical constant @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 , the corresponding term @xmath9 , added to the first law of thermodynamics , generally lacks a direct physical meaning  @xcite .",
    "it is preferable to introduce a new thermodynamic variable and its conjugate which both have a familiar physical meaning .",
    "these variables make up the missing @xmath0-@xmath1 term in the first law of thermodynamics",
    ". such a treatment should apply to any fundamental theory with many physical constants  @xcite .",
    "such a @xmath0-@xmath1 term has arisen in all theories of gravitation where an extra negative cosmological density is taken into consideration .",
    "very recently we have associated a @xmath0-@xmath1 term with both a positive cosmological density and a quintessential one  @xcite . since",
    "a quintessential density is not constant , the associated pressure is the quintessential pressure evaluated at the horizon , and @xmath1 is its corresponding conjugate thermodynamic volume with respect to the enthalpy of the hole .",
    "we aim to generalize this to any density included in the rhs of the field equations @xmath10 ( we use geometric units @xmath11 ) . in this approach , however , to have criticality , we associate no pressure ( @xmath12 ) with a linear electromagnetic density ; that is , we treat an electric charge of a linear electromagnetic density as an intrinsic property of the black hole rather than an external force",
    ". said otherwise , we dispose of a linear electromagnetic density as an internal part of the thermodynamic system .",
    "if a nonlinear electromagnetic density is present in the rhs of the field equations , as is the case with the born - infeld theory  @xcite , this will be split into a linear part with no pressure associated with , and a pressure associated with the remainder of the density .",
    "this generalization extends to include the black holes of modified theories of general relativity , as born - infeld theory .",
    "their field equations can always be brought to the form @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the effective stress - energy tensor ( set ) and @xmath13 is the effective external density .",
    "as we shall see , the effect of the energy densities is linear , in that each added contribution to the rhs of the field equations results in a @xmath0-@xmath1 term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "we shall also show that the notions , and the final expressions , of the thermodynamic potentials and thermodynamic volume depend on how one disposes of the densities as internal or external forces .",
    "let the metric of the static spacetimes be of the form @xmath14 with signature ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "such a metric describes all types of black holes including regular cosmological black holes with a de sitter core  @xcite . throughout this work ,",
    "we dispose of the electric charge of a linear electromagnetic density as an internal , intrinsic property of the black hole ; that is , the energy density due to the electric field is not treated as an external , extra density added to the rhs of the field equations . in sec .",

    "[ secfa ] where we apply the results to born - infeld - ads , born - infeld - ds , martinez - troncoso - zanelli  @xcite , and three regular black holes one of which is determined in this work .    in sec .",
    "[ secq ] we further generalize the results to include multi - physical - constant black holes surrounded by quintessence and provide an application .",
    "finally , the question is discussed of how the @xmath0-@xmath1 term could be introduced in the early literature on black hole thermodynamics with two applications given in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "two appendixes have been added : appendix a shows the relation between the enthalpy and the mass parameter , and appendix b derives the differential equation to which the thermodynamic volume is a solution for black holes not obeying the area law for entropy .",
    "from now on , we use the new radial variable , @xmath29 the entropy of the event horizon is assumed to be proportional to the event horizon area @xmath30 where , almost throughout this paper , we will use conveniently the variable @xmath31 instead of the horizon radius @xmath17 .",

    "it is understood that the expressions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are obtained upon first taking the derivative with respect to @xmath44 then evaluating at @xmath45 . on the event horizon ,",
    "the other important thermodynamic variable is the electric potential @xmath46    if @xmath47 denotes the total energy , @xmath48 , then the field equation @xmath49 yields @xmath50 where we have set @xmath51 which is the extra added density , that is , the total density @xmath47 reduced by the linear electric energy density @xmath52 .    note that our assumptions @xmath53 and @xmath54 [ eq .  ]",
    "imply that @xmath55 . if the metric   is solution to @xmath10 , this results in @xmath56 for the on - shell values of the metric and the fields defining the set .",
    "recall that only the on - shell values are needed for the thermodynamic description of black holes .",
    "the on - shell relation @xmath57 yields the following common and familiar definition of the radial pressure @xmath0 exerted on the event horizon  @xcite .",

    "[ sece ] for comments ) ; however , it includes the pressure @xmath61 due to the mass gradient .",
    "thus , the latter pressure is considered as an external effect .",

    "[ secfa4 ] where the mass parameter is constant , we use the latter as an independent thermodynamic variable or any other parameter other than the electric charge , and in this case @xmath0 depends on @xmath69 and on the other parameter .    by a similar argument used in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to show that @xmath70 is not the appropriate function @xmath71 , for it does not satisfy the requirement  .",

    "is the discrepancy between the enthalpy and the mass parameter for the ds solutions with variable mass parameter used as regular cores  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the expression of the enthalpy given in   is not the unique solution to the system of differential equations   and  .",

    "<S> , we derive universal expressions for the enthalpy , internal energy , free energies , thermodynamic volume , equation of state , law of corresponding states , criticality , and critical exponents of static ( nonrotating ) charged black holes , with possibly a variable mass parameter , whether they are solutions to the einstein field equations or not . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the derivation to the case where the black hole is immersed in the field of a quintessence force and to the multiforce case . </S>",
    "<S> many applications and extensions are considered , including applications to regular black holes derived in previous and present work . </S>",
    "<S> no inconsistency has been noticed in their thermodynamics . </S>"
