    "the study of magnetic vortices in condensed matter physics was established by the seminal work by abrikosov on superconductivity @xcite based in the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . the magnetic field in type ii superconductors form a bidimensional periodic structure known as abrikosov s vortex because its great similarity with the onsager and feynman vortices appearing in superfluid helium ii @xcite .",
    "in the field theory context , magnetic vortex solutions were studied initially in the maxwell - higgs electrodynamics by nielsen and olesen @xcite and by schaposnik and de vega @xcite .",
    "the abelian higgs model , a relativistic generalization of the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity , provides vortex solutions endowed with quantized magnetic flux . from the 1980 s , the topological chern - simons ( cs ) term has played an important role in gauge field theories and condensed matter physics , with its effects being investigated both at the classical and quantum level .",
    "this way , the inclusion of the chern - simons term in models where the gauge field is minimally coupled to fermionic fields @xcite or to higgs fields sv , hkj allows to describe magnetic * *  * * and electrically charged vortices .",
    "further , in some cases @xcite these vortices also saturate the bogomolnyi bound @xcite .    in these previous models ,",
    "the gauge field is coupled minimally with the matter fields .",
    "the first proposal introducing a nonminimal covariant derivative in the abelian higgs model was made by paul and khare @xcite with the aim at showing the generation of the cs term via a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) mechanism .",
    "such a model yielded electrically neutral topological vortices  in contrast to the charged vortices of the chern - simons - higgs ( csh ) model @xcite .",
    "new studies in this context were developed by torres @xcite considering the maxwell - chern - simons - higgs model with the nonminimal covariant derivative , @xmath0 , containing an anomalous magnetic moment contribution .",
    "this model generates nontopological bps electrically charged vortices .",
    "subsequently , ghosh @xcite generalized this model by inserting a dielectric function @xmath1 multiplying the maxwell term and in the nonminimal covariant derivative . this generalized relativistic model and its nonrelativistic limit",
    "also provide bps electrically charged vortices for a certain class of dielectric functions .",
    "other works scrutinizing vortex solutions with this nonminimal coupling can be found in the literature lm .    since 1998 lorentz symmetry",
    "breaking investigations have been considered mainly into the framework of the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite . in this theoretical framework , the lorentz - violating ( lv )",
    "terms arise as vacuum expectation values of tensor structures due to a ssb of the lorentz - symmetry occurring at very high energy scale @xcite .",
    "analysis in the sme involve the fermionic @xcite and the gauge @xcite sectors , and interactions @xcite .",
    "lorentz - violating nonminimal couplings have been examined in an extended version of the minimal sme embracing higher order derivatives terms in the photon sector @xcite and in the fermion sector @xcite .",
    "other types of lorentz - violating nonminimal couplings , representing new interactions between photons and fermions and not contained in the nonminimal extensions of the sme , were proposed as well . a cpt - odd nonminimal coupling of this kind was first considered in the context of the dirac equation by means of the nonminimal covariant derivative , @xmath2 , with @xmath3  being the lv vector background nm1 .",
    "this model was examined in several respects , including the fermion - fermion ultrarelativistic scattering @xcite , generation of radiative corrections @xcite , and the induction of several types of topological and geometrical phases @xcite , and the dynamics of the aharonov  casher - bohm problem @xcite - and see the references therein for major completeness .",
    "lorentz - violating effects on topological defects have been under consideration since the initial investigation about their influence on solitons generated by scalar fields in refs .",
    "topological defects arising in scenarios where occurs spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking by tensor fields was reported in ref .",
    "the pioneering demonstration about existence of bps vortices in a lorentz - violating maxwell - higgs model was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically in the presence of the lv and cpt - even gauge terms of the sme .",
    "_ _ t__he existence of bps  vortex solutions possessing electric field but electrically neutral were first attained in a maxwell - higgs lv cpt - even model @xcite , with interesting properties unobserved in absence of lorentz violation .",
    "the preliminary study about vortexlike solutions in the maxwell - higgs electrodynamics with the carroll - field - jackiw cpt - odd term @xcite was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite , revealing that such model also supports bps and charged vortices .",
    "other studies about vortex configurations were performed in the maxwell - higgs cpt - even lv model @xcite , and in the context of the cpt - odd lv term @xcite .",
    "recently , new effects of lv terms on different kind of defects have been also investigated in the context of oscillons and breathers generated in systems of coupled scalar fields @xcite , traveling solitons in lorentz and cpt - odd models @xcite , and long - living , time - dependent , and spatially localized field oscillons configurations @xcite .    up the moment , no investigation about vortex configurations was performed in the context of field theories with nonminimal couplings in the presence of a preferred direction in spacetime able to violate fundamental symmetries . in this work ,",
    "we propose a maxwell - higgs model with a new nonminimal coupling between the scalar and gauge field , also involving a lorentz - violating vector background .",
    "the main goal is to investigate the existence of topological bps vortices in this maxwell - higgs ( mh ) model pointing out how this additional interaction modifies the usual mh behavior of the solutions . this way the presentation of this article is as follow : in sec .",

    "iv , we perform the numerical solution of the self - dual equations and we do a detailed analysis of the solutions by comparing the effects of the lorentz - violation on the maxwell - higgs self - dual solution . in sec .",
