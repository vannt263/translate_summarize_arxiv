    "the smbh - bulge relations over a galaxy s long evolutionary history , rapid smbh accretion in active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phases probably coincide with periods of high star formation rate in the host galaxy .",
    "indeed , rapidly accreting agns are observed to be predominantly located in the rapidly star - forming galaxies , from the local universe @xcite to higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "but the detailed physical processes behind the coupled growth of smbhs and galaxies remain mysterious .    a key difficulty for any agn / galaxy coevolution model is in efficiently funneling gas down to the smbh sphere of influence .",
    "gas - rich major mergers of galaxies are an effective means to accomplish this , simultaneously ( or near - simultaneously ) igniting both a starburst and a luminous agn @xcite .",
    "however many observations indicate that agns do not prefer merger remnant hosts @xcite , and major mergers are likely to fuel only nearby agns @xcite or the rare population of very luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "violent disk instabilities might provide another solution to the gas inflow problem @xcite .",
    "these models are supported by the observation that massive galaxies at @xmath2 frequently have most of their star formation in massive ( @xmath4-@xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7  pc ) clumps within irregular galaxies @xcite , unlike the much smoother morphologies of similar - mass star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the kinematics of these clumps indicate that they are not accreted as minor mergers , but instead form as in - situ gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "the high gas fractions observed in @xmath2 galaxies @xcite , likely accreted as cold gas along filaments of the cosmic web @xcite , would naturally result in highly turbulent star - forming clumps @xcite .",
    "violent disk instabilities might lead to clumps rapidly falling into the center of a galaxy and efficiently fueling a luminous agn @xcite .",
    "this remains a point of debate , however , as most simulations lack the resolution and detailed physics to follow the gas all the way into a galaxy s center .",
    "observations indicate that star - forming clumps at @xmath2 typically make up only a small fraction of their galaxy s stellar mass , suggesting that they may be too short - lived to migrate all the way into a galaxy center @xcite .",
    "indeed , simulations show that clumps might be destroyed by feedback @xcite or exhausted by star formation @xcite before reaching the nuclear agn . on the other hand",
    ", other simulations find that clumps are sufficiently long - lived to form central bulges and fuel agns even with feedback and mass loss @xcite , and the gas between clumps , rather than the clumps themselves , may be more important for large - scale inflows anyway ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found direct observational evidence for a higher agn fraction in a small sample ( 14 ) of @xmath8 clumpy galaxies compared to smooth ( non - clumpy ) extended disks matched in stellar mass and redshift .",

    "the image centroid and resultant spectral trace may not coincide with the brightest ( continuum or emission line ) flux of a galaxy , particularly for clumpy galaxies : we investigate centering on the brightest flux rather than image centroids in section 4.1 .",

    "the stacked luminosities are shown with the median sfr of each subset in figure [ fig : sfrxray ] .",
    "the small number of objects in each morphology subset means that none are well - detected in the hard band , and only the clumpy and smooth stacks are detected in the soft - band . due to these poor hard band detections ,",
    "the hardness ratios are unconstrained in all three stacks .",
    "the stacked x - ray luminosities ( and upper limits ) for all three samples lie only marginally above the @xmath79 line for sf galaxies , indicating a weak or sub - dominant agn contribution in the x - ray undetected galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the location of most galaxies in the star - forming region of the mex diagram ( figure [ fig : bpt ] ) , and with the lack of nuclear agn in the resolved line ratios among all galaxies ( figure [ fig : bpt_inout ] ) .",
    "we also stack the mex agns in each morphology class , but the numbers of objects are too small to make any meaningful conclusions .",
    "clumpy , smooth , and intermediate galaxies all have similar detected x - ray agn fractions ( @xmath525% ) and stacked x - ray luminosities for undetected sources ( @xmath172 ) . in agreement with the spatially resolved line ratios ,",
    "the x - ray data show essentially no differences for clumpy , smooth , and intermediate morphology galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "both spatially resolved line ratios and x - ray data ( detections and stacked non - detections ) indicate that there is little or no difference in agn fraction between clumpy galaxies and those with smoother morphologies .",
    "while integrated line ratios in the mex method suggest a slightly higher agn fraction among clumpy galaxies , the lack of a nuclear agn signature suggests that this is due to extended phenomena like dense star - forming clumps rather than black hole growth .",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 in each morphology category have similar agn fractions of @xmath52530% , depending on whether x - ray data or spatially resolved line ratios are used for agn selection .",
    "we discuss several implications of these results below .",
    "in section 3.2 we argued that the high @xmath44}}/{\\hbox{{\\rm h}$\\beta$}}$ ] ratio in the extended regions of clumpy galaxies indicates shocks or high - ionization  regions rather than agn activity ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it is instead possible that some clumpy galaxies host off - nuclear agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we test for the presence of off - nuclear agn by creating a 2d stack of clumpy galaxies classified as mex - agns , centering on the @xmath44}}$ ] emission lines rather than the continuum trace .",
    "the brightest knot of @xmath44}}$ ] emission would be most likely to correspond to any off - nuclear agn}}$ ] knot corresponds to an agn is inaccurate if there is large - scale dust asymmetrically obscuring an agn narrow - line region . ] .",
    "the `` nuclear '' region of the @xmath44}}$]-centered stack corresponds to the brightest @xmath44}}$ ] knots rather than the galaxy center , and should therefore be where off - nuclear agns are most likely to reside .",
    "figure [ fig : bpt_linectr ] compares the nuclear and extended @xmath44}}/{\\hbox{{\\rm h}$\\beta$}}$ ] ratios for the continuum - centered stack with the @xmath44}}$]-centered stack of clumpy galaxies .",
    "the right panel suggests that the brightest @xmath44}}$ ] knots are somewhat _ _",
    "l__ess likely to host agns than the galaxy centers .",
    "the lack of widespread off - nuclear agns is also supported by the x - ray data , which indicate that clumpy galaxies do not host a greater number of x - ray agns ( whether nuclear or off - nuclear ) than smoother mass - matched galaxies .",
    "we conclude that there is unlikely to be a large population of off - nuclear agns in clumpy galaxies misclassified by the spatially resolved line ratio method .      at first glance ,",
    "our @xmath3 result is in apparent contrast to the preference for agn in clumpy galaxies at @xmath8 observed by @xcite .",
    "our clumpy galaxy sample has very similar images and morphologies to theirs , as seen in a comparison of figure [ fig : images ] with figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "and although we study a much larger sample ( three times more clumpy galaxies ) , @xcite performed a comprehensive bootstrap analysis which indicates that sample size is very unlikely to lead to the difference .",
    "our studies differ greatly , however , in the comparison samples of smooth galaxies .",
    "@xcite required that both their clumpy and smooth galaxy samples be extended disks .",
    "meanwhile we impose no requirements on morphology beyond the clumpiness classification , and figure [ fig : sersic ] demonstrates that our @xmath2 clumpy and smooth galaxies are quite different in size and @xcite index .",
    "these quantities were measured using galfit @xcite and presented by @xcite .",
    "clumpy galaxies are much more likely to be extended disks , with a median semi - major axis of @xmath173 and 41/44 galaxies having disk - dominated srsic indices ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the smooth galaxies are still mostly disk - dominated , as 30/41 have @xmath174 , but they are significantly smaller ( with a median semi - major axis of @xmath175 ) and have higher srsic indices .",
    "it is interesting that so few smooth extended disks are observed in candels and 3d - hst .",
    "the data are sensitive to the @xmath2 star - forming main sequence at @xmath176 ( figure [ fig : sfrmass ] ) , and so if smooth extended disks exist they must be low - mass and/or weakly star - forming .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that ordered disks are rare in @xmath9 galaxies of any mass , suggesting that the lack of smooth extended disks at @xmath2 is a consequence of galaxy evolution rather than selection effects .",
    "regardless , the lack of smooth extended disks at @xmath2 means we can not perform the same comparison between clumpy and smooth extended disks as @xcite at @xmath8 .",
    "instead we conclude that clumpy extended galaxies have the same agn fraction as more compact and higher - sersic smooth galaxies matched in stellar mass .",
    "our results demonstrate that clumpy galaxies at @xmath2 are no more likely to host agns than are smooth galaxies of the same stellar mass and similar star formation rate .",
    "what does this indicate about agn fueling modes at @xmath2 ?",
    "@xcite argue that compact star - forming galaxies ( also called blue nuggets ) might actually be constructed by a history of violent disk instabilities .",
    "our smooth galaxies , which tend to be more compact and bulgy than the clumpy extended disks , have sizes and sersic indices consistent with this category ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the observed similarity in agn fraction between @xmath10 clumpy and smooth galaxies would then indicate that nuclear inflow onto the agn must persist until after the galaxy becomes stable and the star - forming clumps are no longer visible . in this scenario",
    "the violent disk instabilities are responsible for building a gas reservoir in the galaxy s center .",
    "since the actual nuclear inflow onto the agn persists into the smooth compact galaxy phase , it must not depend on violent instabilities in the larger disk .",
    "so while the gas reservoir is deposited by violent disk instabilities , the agn fueling within @xmath521  kpc must instead be driven by secular processes .    on the other hand",
    ", the disk - dominated nature of the smooth galaxies might imply that they are unlikely to have experienced violent mixing in the past from extreme disk instabilities ( or major mergers ) .",
    "it is also not clear that the smooth galaxies are older than the clumpy galaxies , given their similar position in the sfr - m * plane ( excepting the most massive galaxies : see figure [ fig : sfrmass ] ) .",
    "this might imply that even the large - scale fueling occurs via secular processes , perhaps due to stochastic turbulence from the high gas fractions which are common in @xmath2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite predict that this turbulence - driven stochastic fueling is the dominant mode of smbh growth for @xmath2 galaxies with @xmath177 ( or @xmath178 ) : the same mass range occupied by much of our sample .",
    "assuming that the smooth and clumpy morphologies in our sample trace different fueling modes , then our data best support the scenario of @xcite , where agn growth depends not on fueling mode , but on gas fraction .",
    "we use spatially resolved line ratios and x - ray data to demonstrate that @xmath3 clumpy galaxies are no more likely to host agns than are smoother galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "while integrated line ratios indicate a higher agn fraction in clumpy galaxies , the spatially resolved emission lines show that this is likely due to extended phenomena ( like shocks or high - ionization @xmath91 regions ) rather than nuclear ( or off - nuclear ) agns .",
    "while the smooth galaxies have the same masses and nearly the same star formation rates , they are somewhat smaller and not quite as disk - dominated as the clumpy galaxies . whatever process drives agn fueling in the smooth galaxies is just as efficient as are violent disk instabilities in clumpy galaxies at @xmath2 .",

    "<S> we use candels imaging , 3d - hst spectroscopy , and chandra x - ray data to investigate if active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are preferentially fueled by violent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we select galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number of clumps and degree of patchiness as proxies . </S>",
    "<S> the candels visual classification system is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies , along with mass - matched comparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , despite being being mass - matched and having similar star formation rates , the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulges compared to the clumpy galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of smooth extended disks is probably a general feature of the @xmath1 galaxy population , and means we can not directly compare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selected by integrated line ratios ( in the mass - excitation method ) , but the spatially resolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena rather than nuclear agns . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile the x - ray data show that clumpy , smooth , and intermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived from both individual detections and stacked non - detections . </S>",
    "<S> the data demonstrate that agn fueling modes at @xmath3 - whether violent disk instabilities or secular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpy galaxies . </S>"
