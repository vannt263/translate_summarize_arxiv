    "recently in many research lines of theoretical physics the models in which the spacetime has more dimensions than the four dimensions observable in our daily experience have been studied extensively .",
    "the most analyzed models are those related to string theory @xcite .",
    "also the scrutiny of the properties and solutions of higher dimensional general relativity has attracted a lot of attention ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in several of these research lines",
    "we need to know the classical properties of the higher dimensional spacetimes to examine different phenomena . therefore the investigation of these classical properties is an active research field .    to analyze the classical properties of a given spacetime",
    "a common method is to use a field as probe @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus in the past several scattering phenomena of classical fields were studied , in order to know how to calculate the physical parameters of the spacetime from the measured values of the physical quantities corresponding to the classical field .",
    "the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) are solutions to the equations of motion for a classical field that satisfy the radiation boundary conditions that are natural in the spacetime in which the field is propagating @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for example , in asymptotically flat black holes the boundary conditions of the qnms are that the field is purely ingoing near the event horizon and purely outgoing near infinity @xcite . for asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes we impose the boundary condition that the field vanishes at infinity and is ingoing near the event horizon .",
    "it has been shown that the qnms are a useful tool to calculate the physical parameters of a spacetime @xcite , @xcite . hence if we know the quasinormal frequencies ( qnf ) of a classical field we can infer the values of several physical quantities of the spacetime such as its mass , charge , and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been proposed that the qnms encode some information about the quantum properties of the black holes @xcite .    to compute the qnf of a classical field in a given spacetime",
    "the usual procedure is to reduce the equations of motion for the field to a radial ordinary differential equation ( assuming a given dependence on the angular variables and a harmonic time dependence ) and impose to the radial function the boundary conditions of the qnms .",
    "also notice that the reduced form of the equations of motion is useful ( and sometimes necessary ) to study many other classical or semiclassical phenomena .",
    "thus we believe that at present time the understanding of the separability properties of the equations of motion for classical fields in higher dimensional curved spacetimes must be a relevant part in the education of a physicist .    motivated by these theories that assume a number of spacetime dimensions greater than four",
    ", the separability properties of the equations of motion for several classical fields were studied in higher dimensional backgrounds .",
    "it was found that many of the well known results that are true for four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes extend to @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "for example , the reduction of the equations of motion for klein - gordon , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations to ordinary differential equations which is true in four - dimensional uncharged spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite , also is valid in @xmath0-dimensional uncharged spherically symmetric spacetimes , as showed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover for the coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations the reduction of the equations of motion to schrdinger type equations which is true in four - dimensional charged spherically symmetric backgrounds also is valid for @xmath0-dimensional charged spherically symmetric backgrounds @xcite .",
    "although the study of the classical dynamics of fields in curved spacetimes ( in four and @xmath0 dimensions ) is focused on boson fields @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite mainly on gravitational perturbations , we believe that the understanding of the classical dynamics of the fermion field in @xmath0-dimensional spacetimes is of great value , because the dirac field sometimes behaves in a different way that the boson fields . for example",
    ", it is a well known fact that in the four - dimensional kerr black hole the fermion field does not show superradiant scattering @xcite , @xcite , unlike to boson fields @xcite .    for the dirac equation ,",
    "its separability properties in @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes were previously studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in these papers",
    "is shown that the dirac equation reduces to a pair of coupled partial differential equations in two variables .",
    "owing to the past and future applications of the reduced system of partial differential equations for the dirac equation in @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes , we believe that the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite to reduce the dirac equation to a pair of coupled partial differential equations deserves a detailed exposition , because this account may be practical and useful . here",
    "we present the method in more detail than in the original references , that is , in the present work we explicitly write some mathematical steps omitted in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "notice that section [ sect 2 ] is not an exhaustive review of the previous work on the dynamics of fermion fields in spherically symmetric spacetimes . also observe that in this paper we do not consider in detail the mathematical properties of @xmath0-dimensional spinors , these can be studied in many books and papers ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we only write the essential properties of the spinors necessary to make the reduction of the dirac equation to two coupled partial differential equations that we shall expound in section [ sect 2 ] .",
    "recently the exact computation of the qnf for several higher and lower dimensional spacetimes has attracted a lot of attention , see @xcite-@xcite for some references in which an exact calculation of the qnf was carried out . as many exactly solvable models in theoretical physics",
    ", we believe that these examples are useful models and it is possible that they play a relevant role in future research .    the nariai spacetime is a vacuum solution to the einstein equations with positive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this spacetime is a simple solution to the field equations of general relativity . owing to this simplicity of the nariai solution , it is possible to calculate the values of several physical quantities in exact form .",

    "@xcite were computed exactly the values of the qnf for klein - gordon fields and tensor type gravitational perturbations .",
    "furthermore in the @xmath0-dimensional charged nariai spacetime @xcite , @xcite , the qnf for coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations were calculated exactly in ref .",

    "the result of the previous reference in the charged nariai spacetime is the only exact calculation of qnf for coupled electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in higher dimensions .    as an application for the reduced system of differential equations obtained in section [ sect 2 ] for dirac field moving in @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes",
    ", we exactly calculate the qnf of this field in @xmath0-dimensional nariai spacetime @xcite .",

    "we assume that the reader has a working knowledge of general relativity and differential geometry . furthermore , in the following sections we use einstein s sum convention and understand sum on repeated indices ( latin and greek indices ) , unless we explicitly state that in a given formula we do not understand sum on repeated indices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect 2 ] we present in detail the method of refs .",

    "the real part of the qnf ( [ eq : qn frequencies nariai ] ) show some differences with respect to real part of qnf for klein - gordon , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations ( [ eq : qnf nariai klein - gordon ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai vector ] ) , and ( [ eq : qnf nariai scalar ] ) .",
    "we think that the source of these differences is that in the present section we study the dirac field , whereas in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite the fields studied are massless boson fields .    from formula ( [ eq : qn frequencies nariai ] )",
    ", we obtain that for massless dirac field ( weyl field ) its qnf are equal to @xmath209 even in this case the real part of the qnf ( [ eq : qnf massless dirac ] ) shows a different dependence on the angular momentum number that the real part of the qnf for klein - gordon , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations .",
    "the imaginary part is equal to that of the dirac field .",
    "thus for dirac field in the @xmath0-dimensional nariai spacetime the decay times of its qnms do not depend on the mass .",
    "taking into account the results for qnf ( [ eq : qn frequencies nariai ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai klein - gordon ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai vector ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai scalar ] ) , and ( [ eq : qnf massless dirac ] ) of the @xmath0-dimensional nariai spacetime , we note that their real and imaginary parts show an explicit dependence on the dimension @xmath0 of the spacetime ( the imaginary part through the parameter @xmath210 of formula ( [ eq : sigma nariai ] ) ) .",
    "for all the fields whose qnf have been calculated and for a given mode number @xmath206 we infer that the decay time decreases as the dimension of the spacetime @xmath0 increases .",
    "the dependence of the oscillation frequency on the spacetime dimension @xmath0 is more complicated , it first decreases and then increases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "moreover for @xmath211 and for the same values of @xmath0 , @xmath208 , and @xmath206 the oscillation frequencies of the massless dirac field ( [ eq : qnf massless dirac ] ) are greater than the oscillation frequencies for klein - gordon , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations of formulae ( [ eq : qnf nariai klein - gordon ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai vector ] ) , and ( [ eq : qnf nariai scalar ] ) .    as the harmonic time dependence is of the form @xmath212 ( see formulae ( [ eq : psi 1 2 ansatz ] ) ) , in order to have stable qnms we need that @xmath213 .",
    "we notice that for qnf of formula ( [ eq : qn frequencies nariai ] ) @xmath213 , thus the qnms of the dirac field decay in time .",
    "also for klein - gordon , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations a similar result is true ( see formulae ( [ eq : qnf nariai klein - gordon ] ) , ( [ eq : qnf nariai vector ] ) , and ( [ eq : qnf nariai scalar ] ) ) .",
    "therefore we assert that the @xmath0-dimensional nariai spacetime is perturbatively stable under the propagation of these classical fields .",
    "to finish this section , we note that in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite is shown that the radial differential equations for klein - gordon fields , tensor type gravitational perturbations , and coupled electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations reduce to schrdinger type equations with a pschl - teller potential of the form @xmath214 where the value of the constant @xmath215 depends on the perturbation type ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    following the procedure of chapter 10 in ref .",
    "@xcite we transform eqs .",
    "( [ eq : radial one nariai ] ) into a pair of schrdinger type equations with potentials equal to @xmath216 we observe that these potentials are of morse type ( see table i of ref .",
    ".    for plots of the potentials ( [ eq : potential poschl - teller ] ) and ( [ eq : morse potential ] ) see figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we note that for identical values of @xmath0 , @xmath129 , and @xmath208 the shape of the potentials ( [ eq : potential poschl - teller ] ) and ( [ eq : morse potential ] ) is similar , only observe that the height of pschl - teller potential is smaller than the height of morse potentials .",
    "notice that in figure 1 is plotted the pschl - teller potential corresponding to the qnf @xmath217 , but for pschl - teller potentials ( [ eq : potential poschl - teller ] ) corresponding to the qnf @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 also is true that for identical values of @xmath0 , @xmath129 , and @xmath208 their height is smaller than the height of morse potential ( [ eq : morse potential ] ) .",

    ", we assert that in the charged @xmath0-dimensional nariai spacetime the qnf of the uncharged dirac field are determined by formulae ( [ eq : qn frequencies nariai ] ) , only we must replace in these formulae the values of the quantities @xmath210 and @xmath228 by @xmath232 and @xmath229 , respectively .    for identical values of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath129 , and @xmath206 ,",
    "morse potentials ( [ eq : morse potential ] ) and pschl - teller potentials ( [ eq : potential poschl - teller ] ) have qnf with identical imaginary parts , that is with identical decay times , even when for identical values of @xmath0 , @xmath129 , and @xmath208 the height of pschl - teller potential is smaller than the height of morse potentials ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we believe that to find the source of this coincidence is an interesting question .    also , in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown that for sufficiently late times the radial functions of pschl - teller potential ( [ eq : potential poschl - teller ] ) form a complete basis .",
    "owing to similarity of the plots for both potentials ( see again figures 1 and 2 ) , to study if a similar result is valid for morse potential ( [ eq : morse potential ] ) deserves a detailed investigation .    as we previously comment a similar reduction to that of section [ sect 2 ] works for charged dirac fields propagating in the @xmath0-dimensional charged spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we believe that a good exercise is to calculate the qnf of the charged dirac field propagating in the @xmath0-dimensional charged nariai spacetime to extend the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and the previous section .",
    "as we observe in introduction section , the results on the separability of the dirac equation in the four - dimensional kerr black hole generalize to some @xmath0-dimensional rotating black holes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we believe that the extension of the results obtained in these references to the metrics of plebanski - demianski - klemm type @xcite deserve a detailed analysis .",
