    "in the present talk i will review the progress made in the last couple of years in _ ab initio _ microscopic calculations of the @xmath0h(@xmath1)@xmath2he  @xcite and @xmath2he(@xmath3)@xmath4he  @xcite capture reactions .",
    "these reactions provide a sensitive testing ground for models of nuclear interactions and currents .",
    "the outline of the talk is as follows .",
    "i will first describe the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics method used to obtain accurate wave functions for the @xmath8=3 and 4 bound and scattering states .",
    "next , i will discuss the model for the nuclear electromagnetic current , and will review our current understanding of the radiative capture reaction @xmath0h(@xmath7,@xmath9)@xmath2he . in the third part , i will discuss the model for the nuclear weak current , and present results for the proton weak capture on @xmath2he .",
    "this process has lately received considerable attention , due to the super - kamiokande collaboration measurements of the energy spectrum of electrons recoiling from scattering with solar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of few - nucleon capture reactions constitutes a challenging problem from the standpoint of nuclear few - body theory .",
    "for example , since the @xmath8=3 and 4 bound states are approximate eigenstates of the magnetic moment operator , the corresponding transition matrix elements between these and the initial @xmath6@xmath7 ( or @xmath6@xmath10 ) and @xmath11he states , occurring in the radiative captures , vanish due to orthogonality . as a result ,",
    "these capture processes are extremely sensitive to : ( i ) small components in the wave functions , particularly the d - state admixtures generated by tensor interactions , ( ii ) many - body terms in the electro - weak current operator , and ( iii ) p - wave capture contributions .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian used in the calculations reported here has the form    @xmath12    where the two - nucleon interaction is the argonne @xmath13 ( av18 ) model  @xcite , and the three - nucleon interaction is the urbana - ix ( uix ) model  @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian predicts reasonably well the low - lying energy spectra of systems with @xmath14 nucleons in exactgreen s function monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the experimental binding energies of the trinucleons and @xmath15 particle are exactly reproduced , while those of the @xmath8=68 systems are underpredicted by a few percent .",
    "this underbinding becomes ( relatively ) more and more severe as the neutron - proton asymmetry increases .",
    "an additional failure of the av18/uix model is the underprediction of spin - orbit splittings in the excitation spectra of these light systems .",
    "these failures have in fact led to the development of new three - nucleon interaction models .",
    "these developments as well as a discussion of a number of issues regarding two - nucleon interactions , such as non - localities , unitary equivalence , etc . , can be found in friar s",
    "@xcite and pandharipande s  @xcite contributions to these proceedings .",
    "while the nuclear interaction models above are simple to write down , bound- and scattering - state solutions for light nuclei have proven to be rather difficult to obtain .",
    "intense work in this area and the continuing increase in computational capabilities have led , by now , to the development of a number of methods , each with different strengths and domains of applicability ( for a review and an assessment of them , see ref .",
    "the faddeev - yakubovsky and quantum monte carlo methods are reviewed , respectively , by glckle  @xcite and pandharipande  @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "here , i will briefly discuss the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics ( chh ) technique , as implemented by the pisa group for the @xmath8=3  @xcite and @xmath8=4  @xcite nuclei , and summarize a number of results obtained for the bound - state properties and low - energy scattering parameters .",
    "in essence , the chh method consists in expanding the wave functions on a suitable basis , and in determining the expansion coefficients variationally . as an example",
    ", the trinucleon bound - state wave function is written as    @xmath16    where the hyperradius @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the jacobi variables ) , and the known functions @xmath20 are antisymmetric under the exchange @xmath21 and account for the angle ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , spin ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , isospin ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and hyperangle ( @xmath28 ) dependence of channel @xmath15 .",
    "correlation factors , which account for the strong state - dependent correlations induced by the nucleon - nucleon interaction , are included in the functions @xmath20 .",
    "the rayleigh - ritz variational principle , @xmath29 , is used to determine the ground - state energy @xmath30 and the functions @xmath31 . carrying out the variations with respect to the @xmath32 s leads to a set of coupled second - order differential equations , which are then solved by standard numerical techniques .    the @xmath33@xmath6 cluster wave function @xmath34 ( again , as an example ) , having incoming orbital angular momentum @xmath35 and channel spin @xmath36 coupled to total @xmath37 , is expressed as    @xmath38    where the term @xmath39 vanishes in the limit of large intercluster separation , and hence describes the system in the region where the particles are close to each other and their mutual interactions are large .",
    "the term @xmath40 , instead , describes the system in the asymptotic region , and contains the dependence upon the @xmath41-matrix elements , from which phase - shifts and mixing angles are obtained .",
    "the core  wave function @xmath39 is expanded in the same basis as the bound - state wave function @xmath42 , and both the @xmath41-matrix elements and functions @xmath31 occurring in the expansion of @xmath39 are determined by making use of the kohn variational principle .",
    "results for the @xmath2he and @xmath4he binding energies , and @xmath5he scattering lengths , obtained with the chh method , are listed in table  [ tb : scl ] .",
    ".binding energies , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , of @xmath2he and @xmath4he , and @xmath5he singlet and triplet s - wave scattering lengths , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , calculated with the chh method using the av18 and av18/uix hamiltonian models .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the chief conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath47 @xmath36-factor is predicted to be @xmath48 4.5 times larger than the value adopted in the standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement , while very significant , is smaller than that first suggested in ref .",
    "even though this result is inherently model dependent , it is unlikely that the model dependence is large enough to accommodate a drastic increase in the value obtained here .",
    "indeed , calculations using hamiltonians based on the av18 two - nucleon interaction only and the older av14/uviii two- and three - nucleon interactions predict zero energy @xmath36-factor values of @xmath49 kev  b and @xmath50 kev  b , respectively .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the av18 model , in contrast to the av14/uviii , does not reproduce the experimental binding energies and low - energy scattering parameters of the three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "the av14/uviii prediction is only 6 % larger than the av18/uix zero - energy result .",
    "this 6 % variation should provide a fairly realistic estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to the model dependence .",
    "the implications of these predictions for the superkamiokande ( sk ) solar neutrino spectrum are summarized fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the sk results are presented as the ratio of the measured electron spectrum to that expected in the ssm with no neutrino oscillations . over most of the spectrum ,",
    "this ratio is constant at @xmath51 . at the highest energies , however ,",
    "an excess relative to @xmath52ssm is seen ( though it has diminished in successive data sets ) .",
    "the sk 825-day data are shown by the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ( the error bars denote the combined statistical and systematic error ) . in the figure , the ratio of the @xmath47 flux to its value in the ssm ( based on the @xmath47 s - factor prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is denoted by @xmath15 , defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the @xmath47-neutrino suppression constant . presently , @xmath55 , if @xmath47 neutrino oscillations are ignored . the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] indicate the effect of various values of @xmath15 on the ratio of the electron spectrum with both @xmath56b and @xmath47 to that with only @xmath56b ( the ssm ) . in calculating this ratio ,",
    "the @xmath56b flux in the numerator has been suppressed by 0.47 , the best - fit constant value for the observed suppression . if the @xmath47 neutrinos are suppressed by @xmath51 , then @xmath57 .",
    "two other arbitrary values of @xmath15 ( 10 and 20 ) are shown for comparison .",
    "it appears that the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite is unable to explain the distortion observed in the spectrum at the highest energies .",
    "improvements in the modeling of two- and three - nucleon interactions and nuclear electro - weak currents , and the significant progress made in the last few years in the description of bound and continuum wave functions , make it now possible to perform first - principle calculations of interesting low - energy reactions involving light nuclei .",
    "while the extension of the chh technique to treat systems with @xmath58 may prove difficult , variational and green s function monte carlo methods should be able to deal with them effectively , in particular their pre - capture continuum states .",
    "experimentally known electromagnetic and weak transitions of systems in the mass range @xmath59 will provide powerful constraints on models of nuclear currents .",
    "work along these lines is being vigorously pursued .",
