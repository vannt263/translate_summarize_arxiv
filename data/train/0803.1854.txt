    "<S> the existence of this degeneracy is independent of details such as the permittivity and radius of the rods , as long as the @xmath0 symmetry is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy is of particular interest since wang _ et .  </S>",

    "<S> the quadratic degeneracy is robust against perturbations that preserve this symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it can be lifted by parity and time - reversal symmetry breaking ( which we will henceforth simply refer to as parity breaking . ) in that case , the two bands acquire chern numbers @xcite of @xmath3 , in agreement with the numerical result of wang _ _ et .  al.__@xcite breaking the @xmath4 rotational symmetry `` unpins '' the quadratic degeneracy point , which splits apart into two distinct linear degeneracies . </S>",
    "<S> the theory applies to any two - dimensional bloch system , whether electronic or photonic , with @xmath0 symmetry and a quadratic degeneracy point . in particular </S>",

    "<S> this breaks the symmetry under @xmath29 rotations and reflections about the @xmath30 and @xmath31 axes . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we could distort the rods by stretching them along the @xmath30 or @xmath31 axes  or , alternatively , stretching the lattice vectors and rescaling @xmath32 and/or @xmath33 ; this breaks the symmetry under rotations and reflections about @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , we could break parity , which can be accomplished in a photonic crystal , e.g. , using a magneto - optic effect that adds an imaginary off - diagonal term @xmath35 to the permeability tensor of the rods@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this hamiltonian is valid in the neighborhood of @xmath43 , and we have omitted @xmath44 terms which have negligible effects on the band properties in the regime of interest . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we assume that the symmetry - breaking is weak ( e.g.  @xmath45 ) , and thus retain only symmetry - breaking terms that are zeroth - order in @xmath46 .     and permittivity @xmath47 , plotted against the @xmath2-space displacement from the corner of the brillouin zone , @xmath48 , along the line @xmath49 . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bands](b ) of the current paper .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us consider @xmath74 , keeping @xmath75 . for @xmath76 , </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic degeneracy splits into two distinct degeneracy points , at @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we will henceforth assume that @xmath78 ; the following discussion can be easily adapted to the @xmath80 case . </S>",
    "<S> let us expand the hamiltonian around @xmath81 , using the variables @xmath82 which are simply @xmath2-space displacements from @xmath81 , rotated by @xmath83 . to first order in @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 when @xmath69 and @xmath64 , this reduces to a two - dimensional dirac hamiltonian near each each degeneracy point ( or `` dirac point '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath12 plays the role of a mass term , opening a bandgap @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath88 distorts the dirac hamiltonian and its eigenvalue spectrum ; for example , the dirac cones in the @xmath67 limit become tilted in @xmath2-space , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dirac points](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> along the line @xmath89 , the splitting of the degeneracy point can be thought of as a vertical relative displacement of the two parabolic bands ( note , however , that the bands meet only at isolated points in the full @xmath46-space . ) </S>",
    "<S> the splitting is accompanied by a change in the density of states from a discontinuity to a linear `` dip '' centered at the frequency of the band degeneracy . when @xmath71 , the density of ( tm ) states is discontinuous at the band edges , dropping to zero inside the band gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is very similar for @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath91 , the degeneracy splits into two , but along the line @xmath92 ( if @xmath93 ) or @xmath94 ( if @xmath95 ) , instead of @xmath96 . when both @xmath39 and @xmath41 are nonzero , the degeneracies are located at an intermediate location , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , and expanding around each point yields a dirac - like hamiltonian analogous to ( [ dirac equation ] ) .    when @xmath71 , the bands are non - degenerate , and their chern numbers @xcite can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this calculation are given in the appendix , and the result is that the upper and lower bands possess chern numbers @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , regardless of the values of @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the existence of a single family of one - way edge modes @xcite , and agrees exactly with the numerical results of wang _ _ et .  </S>",
    "<S> al.__@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the effective hamiltonian ( [ ansatz ] ) is only valid near @xmath43 , it yields the same chern number as the actual bandstructure because only the region near the broken degeneracy point provides a non - vanishing `` berry flux '' contribution to the chern number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while our theory only describes weak symmetry - breaking , the chern number is a topological quantity and can not be altered by non - perturbative distortions ( as long as the bands remain non - degenerate @xcite ) , which is why it remains unchanged even in the strong parity - breaking regime explored by wang _ et .  </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ when @xmath39 and/or @xmath41 are non - zero , the two linear degeneracy points each contribute @xmath101 to the chern number , in accordance with previous analyses of the dirac hamiltonian @xcite . when @xmath102 , the berry connection winds twice as fast around the point @xmath43 , which provides the entire contribution of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the chern number on the sign of @xmath12 confirms that @xmath12 controls parity breaking , since the chern number can be shown to vanish identically when parity is unbroken .    </S>",
    "<S> the fully symmetric hamiltonian @xmath103 must transform under any operation @xmath104 as @xmath105 regardless of the values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 , this holds if @xmath106 falls under @xmath107 , the only two - dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath108 rotations can be represented by @xmath109 , reflections about the @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) axes by @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , and reflections about @xmath89 by @xmath114 .    by studying how @xmath115 transforms under @xmath107 </S>",
    "<S> , we can show that the quadratic degeneracy is protected by the crystal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> any zeroth - order term proportional to the identity matrix , when added to @xmath116 , simply shifts the eigenvalues without opening a gap . adding a zeroth - order term proportional to @xmath112 ( i.e. @xmath90 ) breaks @xmath0 since , under the representation @xmath107 , @xmath117 for @xmath4 rotations and reflections across @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath118 for reflections across the @xmath110 and @xmath111 axes , in agreement with our claim that @xmath90 corresponds to stretching the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , setting @xmath71 preserves the rotational symmetries but breaks the reflection symmetries ( parity ) . finally , setting @xmath74 preserves the reflection symmetry across @xmath119 but breaks the symmetry under @xmath4 rotations and reflections across @xmath94 and @xmath92 .    furthermore , the hamiltonian can not include terms that are first - order in @xmath120 if the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken or only partially broken . </S>",
    "<S> such terms have the general form @xmath121 , and we can show that @xmath122 for all @xmath123 as long as the system is symmetric under either rotations , reflections about the @xmath110 and @xmath111 axes , or reflections about @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> at least one of these symmetries is preserved by each of the three `` elementary '' distortions discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this situation may be contrasted with a triangular or honeycomb lattice , for which there is a @xmath125 symmetry around each corner of the hexagonal brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> there , one can write down an @xmath126 hamiltonian which transforms under a two - dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath125 : this is just the dirac hamiltonian @xmath127 in this case , a zeroth - order `` mass '' term proportional to @xmath128 controls parity breaking @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> we first determined @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath133 by fitting the computed bandstructures of the fully - symmetric crystal to ( [ symmetric eigenvalues ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gamma dependence ] , we obtain values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 that depend on the details of the crytal , including the rod radius and permittivity .    upon perturbing the simulated crystals by changing the lattice constant slightly along ( say ) the @xmath30 direction , @xmath134 , the degeneracy splits along the line @xmath92 in the computed bandstructures . from the location of the linear degeneracies , we can obtain @xmath39 , which turns out to be proportional to @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , setting @xmath136 induces linear degeneracies along the line @xmath137 , and @xmath41 is found to be proportional to @xmath42 . by computing the bands for off - diagonal permeability component @xmath35 in the rods , and fitting these to ( [ symmetric eigenvalues ] ) , we find that @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ alphas ] . like @xmath10 and @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the proportionality factors @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 depend on the details of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the linear degeneracies induced by @xmath74 are not determined solely by the lattice geometry stands in contrast to dirac points in previously - studied triangular and hexagonal lattices , which are pinned to the corners of the brillouin zone .    , @xmath12 , and @xmath41 for two different photonic crystals . </S>",

    "<S> [ gamma dependence ] ( which were obtained using the symmetric lattice ) ; it is plotted against the imaginary off - diagonal permeability component , @xmath35 . we obtain @xmath41 from the location of the degeneracies @xmath148 , for lattice distortion angle @xmath42.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    in conclusion , we have presented an effective theory for a pair of bands in the vicinity of a band degeneracy , within a two - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric crystal . the high degree of symmetry near the degeneracy point determines the form of the @xmath24 effective hamiltonian matrix , including the lowest - order symmetry - breaking terms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we showed that quadratic nature of the degeneracy is protected by the @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the theory accurately describes the second and third tm bands of square - lattice photonic crystals near their m - point degeneracy , including the correct chern numbers when parity is broken @xcite . on the other hand , the theory should be applicable to any electronic or photonic system possessing @xmath0 symmetry and a two - fold band degeneracy ; it is possible , for instance , to construct tight - binding electronic models that reduce to our effective hamiltonian ( [ ansatz ] ) near a degeneracy point . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the present method is that it relies only on symmetry principles , and can therefore be applied to systems , such as photonic crystals , where other methods such as tight - binding are not applicable . for lattice symmetries other than @xmath0 , effective hamiltonians can be constructed by finding an appropriate representation of the symmetry group .    </S>",
