    "thermal neutron detection with spatial resolution around or below 0.2 mm will become mandatory for modern thermal neutron crystallography or fast imaging detectors @xcite .",
    "gaseous micro - pattern detectors like gem ( gaseous electron multiplier ) or micromegas have proven to reach spatial resolutions well below 100 @xmath0 m @xcite , depending on the fineness of their segmentation . here",
    "a self calibrating tpc - like analysis for this kind of detector is presented with a gem - detector .",
    "a triple gem - detector with segmented 2d - readout of 0.4 mm pitch was used in combination with a @xmath1b converter cathode to detect thermal neutrons .",
    "thermal neutron capture in @xmath1b has a high cross section and produces a @xmath2li and a @xmath3he ion back - to - back with a combined energy of 2.8 mev .",
    "@xmath4    the heavy he or li ion create a straight line of ionized electrons in the drift - volume of a micro - pattern detector .",
    "the full track information can be reconstructed from the electron drift time measured as a function of the responding readout segments .",
    "this allows for reconstruction of the neutron interaction point in the converter cathode .",
    "the apv front - end - electronics samples the signal on every strip in steps of 25 ns . with typical rise times of 150",
    "ns the beginning of a signal , and thus the drift time of the respective electrons , can be determined with a fit to the rise of the charge distributions .        from a fit to the starting times as a function of hit strips the inclination angle of the track can be reconstructed .",
    "as conversion cathode a 2 @xmath0 m layer of @xmath1b evaporated on an aluminum supporting sheet has been used .",
    "it was mounted to a triple gem detector with two - dimensional strip readout , based on crossed strips with a pitch of 400 @xmath0 m in both directions .",
    "the readout anode was delivered by cern .",
    "x and y directions are covered by 256 strips each with a copper strip width of 80 @xmath0 m for the upper layer and 320 @xmath0 m for the lower layer .",
    "all the insulator material but the direct insulation between x and y copper strips have been etched off , such that the different copper width guarantees similar pulse - height in both planes .",
    "the readout is based on apv-25 front - end boards @xcite and the srs data acquisition system @xcite and was triggered by the signal on the lower side of the last gem - foil , which is in principle the inverted signal of the readout plane .",
    "the drift gas , ar - co@xmath5 of 93:7 vol.% at atmospheric pressure , defines in combination with the thickness of the absorber the maximum range of the @xmath3he ions to 12 mm .",
    "the width of the drift gap of 6 mm was chosen to decrease the impact of the bragg - peak in the track reconstruction and to assure that only tracks with large inclination angle stop in the active volume .",
    "the distances between gem - foils and the distance between last gem - foil and the readout anode was 2 mm each . for optimized spatial resolution",
    "the drift velocity of the electrons was chosen quite low to 11 @xmath0m / ns , by adapting the electric field in the drift region to the time resolution of the apv25 chips .",
    "( 13.4 mev ) are collimated through a system of four apertures to a slit of 250 @xmath0 m width and 65 mm height on the converter cathode of a gem - detector ]    neutrons of 4.7    are available at the garching frmii research reactor at the treff beam line .",
    "the beam was collimated by a system of four apertures , see figure [ be ] .",
    "the collimation was done by the collimators 1 , 2 and 4 and a possible beam halo was cut by collimator 3 .",
    "the beam was formed to a slit of 180 @xmath0 m width and 65 mm height , defined by the collimators on the last aperture , which lead to a maximum width of the beam spot on the converter cathode of 250 @xmath0 m with only 0.32 mrad divergence . to determine the neutron profile on the conversion layer the hit distribution has been approximated by a boxcar function .",
    "the convolution with the gaussian - distribution describing the spatial detector resolution allows then to simulate the measured distribution .",
    "this leads to a double error - function of the form :    @xmath6    @xmath7 denotes a normalization factor , @xmath8 is the half width of the slit , @xmath0 is the center of the slit and @xmath9 is the standard deviation of the gaussian , which represents the detector - resolution .        in a standard analysis",
    "the neutron position would be determined by the center of the charge distribution for every track in the readout plane .",
    "the error in position resolution is therefore limited by the inclination angle and the length of the track of the secondary ion , see figure [ fig : conv - point ] .",
    "the resolution achievable by this method is a fwhm of 3.4 @xmath10 0.1 mm .",
    "the width of the distribution is 3.4 mm ( fwhm ) ( @xmath110.4 mm ) . ]",
    "the resolution can be improved by determining the starting point of the secondary ion track and thus the point of conversion in the cathode .    with a single gem - detector spatial resolution of below 470@xmath0 m",
    "could already be achieved by determination of the last strip , which was hit in a track(@xcite ) . in a triple gem - setup",
    "the spread of the charge cloud by diffusion towards the anode is quite significant .",
    "this can be overcome by fully tracking the ions in the drift volume .",
    "the method would work best if all ions would transverse the complete drift region and if the correlation between responding readout strips and ion track would be precise .",
    "certainly , ions with large inclination angles stop within the 6 mm wide drift region .",
    "the systematic effects : electron diffusion and capacitive coupling of neighboring readout strips , lead to an overestimation of the length of the track on both ends for both traversing and stopping ions .",
    "therefore , the tpc - like reconstruction is dependent on the track length , the inclination angle , and the non - homogeneous the charge distribution in the track , the skewness .",
    "skewness and track length are dependent on the particle type as well .                in the following the dependencies of the reconstruction on the track length , and the skewness of the charge distribution in the track",
    "will be discussed .",
    "these corrections are performed by linear fits to internal detector correlations see figure [ fig : conv - point ] .",
    "figure [ pic : linefit ] shows a clear correlation between the projected track length in one readout direction of a track and the reconstructed position .",
    "the length of the track is determined from a gaussian fit to the charge distribution on all responding strips individually in x and y direction .",
    "the dependence of the centroid position on the projected track length was determined by linear fit and the position was corrected depending on the projected track length .",
    "after application of this correction the dependence of the reconstructed position on the skewness of the charge distribution is shown in figure [ pic : etafit ] .",
    "the linear fit gives the parameters for the correction in a second step and in the last step the fit to the reconstructed angle of the track as a function of reconstructed position is investigated , as shown in figure [ pic : anglefit ] .",
    "since there are dependencies of all these measurement parameters it is not advantageous to correct them iteratively in a calibration one after the other .",
    "the result of this calibration is shown in figure [ fig : x - good ] , where the projection of the strip in the x - direction is shown and the resolution is determined by a fit of equation [ fit ] . a spatial resolution of ( 235 @xmath10 25 ) @xmath0 m fwhm ( @xmath12(100 @xmath10 15 ) @xmath0 m ) is achieved .",
    "20 ) @xmath0 m fwhm ( @xmath130.4 mm ) ]",
    "using @xmath0tpc analysis the inclination angle of the track is determined , which defines the direction of the track . as origin the centroid of the tracks was determined and its dependence on the track length , inclination angle , and the skewness of the charge distribution in the track is examined .",
    "the iteration of calibration factors determined from linear fits to the reconstructed position in dependence to the mentioned track parameters were adapted to compensate for these .",
    "altogether this corrections in addition to a cut on the minimal track length of 3.5 strips in both directions led to a gaussian distribution with an improved resolution of ( 235@xmath1025 ) @xmath0 m fwhm ( @xmath12 100@xmath1015 @xmath0 m ) in comparison to a standard centroid determination with a resolution of 3.4 mm .",
    "this procedure produces implicitly correction factors that have been so far obtained in mip tracking experiments by dedicated calibration runs with known incidence angle of the particle beam .",
    "this work is based upon experiments performed at the treff instrument operated by frmii at the heinz maier - leibnitz zentrum ( mlz ) , garching , germany .",
