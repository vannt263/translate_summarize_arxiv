    "an exception is the case when the energy scale of all the processes involved is such that only transitions between two adjacent levels are possible . since the only driving force to induce transitions is a quasi - static variation of the magnetic field intensity , the azimuthal symmetry of the hamiltonian eq.([eq4 ] )",
