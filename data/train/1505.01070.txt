    "in 1986 , ziff , gulari , and barshad introduced a lattice - gas model ( known as the zgb model ) to simulate the nonequilibrium process of the oxidation of carbon monoxide on a pt catalyst @xcite .",
    "the catalyst surface is modeled as a @xmath0 square lattice , and a random site is chosen @xmath1 times in each time step ( mcss , monte carlo step per site ) .",
    "adsorption of the gas species can take place only if the chosen site is empty .",
    "co is adsorbed with probability @xmath2 , which is proportional to its partial pressure in the supplied gas .",
    "adsorption of oxygen is attempted with probability @xmath3 , but is successful only if a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor site is also empty .",
    "@xmath4 then dissociates into two adsorbed o atoms .",
    "after the adsorption , the adsorbed species checks its four nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "if the opposite species is found , the pair forms carbon dioxide ( @xmath5 ) and leaves the surface immediately .",
    "it has further been noticed in experiments that adsorbed species can desorb from the surface without reacting , and that the desorption rate of carbon monoxide is much higher than that of oxygen @xcite .",
    "therefore , the desorption rate of co ( @xmath6 ) is often added to the model as a second control parameter , in addition to the @xmath7 partial pressure ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we choose desorption with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the desorption rate can be considered as a proxy for temperature as thermal fluctuations would make the adsorbed particle break its bond with the catalyst surface more easily .",
    "if the co desorption rate ( @xmath6 ) is not very high , simulations show that the catalyst surface can be in one of three phases , depending on the value of the co partial pressure ( @xmath2 ) : 1 .",
    "co poisoned phase , which has co covering most of the surface with some scattered empty sites .",
    "it is observed when @xmath2 is large .",
    "o - poisoned phase , which has oxygen covering the whole surface when the co partial pressure ( @xmath2 ) is sufficiently low ( not observed in experiments ) .",
    "3 . mixed phase , in which the catalyst surface is covered by a mixture of o , co , and empty sites .",
    "it is observed for intermediate values of @xmath2 .",
    "the order parameter of the system is the co coverage ( @xmath8 ) , which is defined as the proportion of the lattice sites occupied by co. a first - order phase transition line separates the mixed phase and the co poisoned phase .",
    "similar to an equilibrium lattice - gas system , moving along this first - order transition line in the phase diagram eventually leads to a critical point .",
    "it has been found that this critical point belongs to the two - dimensional equilibrium ising universality class @xcite .",
    "recent studies of adding non - zero long - range interactions in an equilibrium ising ferromagnet @xcite showed that the universality class of the critical point changed abruptly from ising to mean - field .",
    "motivated by this result , we recently modified the zgb model by introducing an adjustable probability ( @xmath9 ) that an o atom and a co molecule adsorbed far apart on the surface can react to form @xmath10 and desorb @xcite .",
    "this move is attempted only if the adsorbed species can not find an opposite species within its four nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "if the two sites contain opposite species , @xmath10 will be formed and the two sites will become empty .",
    "details of the implementation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_flow_chat_long_range ] .    while our recent work @xcite has shown that the universality class of the critical point changes from the ising class to the mean - field class using fourth - order cumulants , here we look at the fluctuations of the order parameter ( co coverage ) at the critical point through two quantities , the susceptibility and the time average of the absolute difference of the co coverage from its mean value .",
    "the results further confirm the change of the universality class of the critical point from ising to mean - field upon introducing long - range reactivity .",
    "figure  [ fig_zgb_thesis_fakefluct_and_index](a ) shows a ln - ln scaling relation between the time average of the absolute difference of the co coverage from its mean ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the critical points were found in our recent work @xcite , using cumulant crossing .",
    "the negatives of the slopes of these lines represent the critical exponent ratio @xmath12 and are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgb_thesis_fakefluct_and_index](b ) . without long - range reactivity ( @xmath13 ) , we obtain @xmath14 , which is close to the exact ising value of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for the case with long - range reactivity ( @xmath17 ) , the weighted average is @xmath18 , consistent with the exact mean - field result of @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "we define a nonequilibrium analog of equilibrium magnetic susceptibility or fluid compressibility as @xmath20 for a @xmath0 system , which for simplicity we call susceptibility. it is well suited to measure the strong fluctuations of the order parameter near the nonequilibrium critical point @xcite . figure .",
    "[ fig_zgb_susceptibility_vs_l](a ) shows the natural logarithm of the susceptibility ( @xmath21 ) vs the natural logarithm of the system size ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "we get a weighted average of @xmath26 , which is close to the exact mean - field value of @xmath27 .",
    "we define the co disconnected correlation function as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is @xmath27 if site @xmath30 is occupied by co and is @xmath31 otherwise , @xmath32 is the distance between site @xmath30 and site @xmath33 , and the spatial average is taken along the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "the critical correlation length was estimated by integration as @xmath34 r dr}{\\int^{l/2}_{0 } [ \\langle c(r)\\rangle - \\langle c(l/2)\\rangle ] dr } \\ ] ] as in @xcite and @xcite . in the study of an ising model with long - range interactions of strength @xmath35 @xcite , nakada _",
    "_ suggested the scaling relation @xmath36 .",
    "they plotted @xmath37 against @xmath38 using the ising value of @xmath39 and verified that the data points all fell onto one curve @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 was not too small , the log - log plot of the graph had a slope of @xmath40 .",
    "here we tried the same procedure with our long - range reactivity @xmath9 , also using @xmath39 , and obtained fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation_scaling](a ) .",
    "although the data points do not lie perfectly on one curve , in a ln - ln plot , we also obtain a straight line with slope close to @xmath40 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation_scaling](b ) . using @xmath41 as obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig_zgb_susceptibility_vs_l ] , gives nearly exactly the same graphs , just with the slope in ( b ) changed from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "so it is justified to claim @xmath39 .    in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we also tried to obtain @xmath44 by looking at the scaling relation between the change in critical desorption rate with the change in long - range reactivity , as well as the scaling relation between change in critical co partial pressure with the change in long - range reactivity .",
    "we obtained @xmath45 and @xmath46 and expected that one of these values should be @xmath44 of the @xmath13 case , as we know that for the 2d equilibrium ising model with long - range interaction of strength @xmath35 , the change in critical temperature against the change in long - range interaction strength @xmath35 is known to behave as @xmath47 with @xmath44 obtained from the @xmath13 case , i.e. @xmath48 @xcite .    the index values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , both deviate significantly from @xmath48 .",
    "we therefore suggested in @xcite that @xmath9 might not be linearly related to @xmath35 , but rather as @xmath51 .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation_scaling](b ) suggests that the relation for the equilibrium system , @xmath36 , still holds for our model with @xmath35 replaced by @xmath9 , which means @xmath52 .",
