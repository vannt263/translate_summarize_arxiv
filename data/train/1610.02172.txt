    "frustration in spin systems refers to competing interactions that can not be satisfied simultaneously and this phenomenon has attracted significant scientific attention in last few decades due to its unusual ordering properties of the ground states @xcite .",
    "one type of frustration is geometric frustration , where the frustration is caused by the special structure of the crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "a well - known example is the antiferromagnetically coupled ising spin model with @xmath3 on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangle lattice @xcite . with two spins on the vertices aligned antiparallel to each other",
    ", the third spin can not find an preferable orientation to gain exchange energy , which results in the absence of long - range ferromagnetic order and high degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "the other type of frustration comes from the competing magnetic exchange interactions instead of the lattice itself @xcite .",
    "typical examples are 2d square lattices with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction @xmath0 and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath1 @xcite . depending on the sign of @xmath4 and the ratio of @xmath5",
    ", the ground state of the system could be a columnar antiferromagnet ( afm ) ( 2-sublattice afm ) , a nel afm ( 4-sublattice afm ) , and a disordered phase @xcite .",
    "generally , the existence of frustration would suppress the formation of long - range ordering phase and give rise to some short - range ordered phase such as spin glass and spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the skyrmion lattice , a long - range ordered vortex - like topological magnetic structure , has been recently realized in chiral magnets @xcite with dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "each skyrmion consists of spins that point in all directions wrapping a unit sphere .",
    "skyrmion can be represented by a topological charge @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the unit vector of spin and the cartesian coordinates @xmath8 lie in the film plane .",
    "then skyrmion lattice could be viewed as regularly patterned topological charges , whose stability is topologically protected . an interesting question is how topologically non - trivial structures like skyrmions respond to the frustration in a system ?",
    "a pioneering work studied the isotropic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice and found that a skyrmion lattice and multi - q states could exist at non - zero temperatures even in the absence of dm interaction @xcite .",
    "a followed work focused on the anisotropic frustrated spin model and showed that multiply periodic states even exist at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "however , yet to be known is how the frustration influences the existence and energy - preferable window ( epw ) of a skyrmion lattice stabilized by dm interaction .",
    "that is the motivation of the current work .    in this article , we focus on a frustrated square lattice with dm interaction .",
    "the frustration is introduced through the competing between nn fm interaction and nnn afm interaction .",
    "the energy - preferable window of the skyrmion phase as well as hysteresis loop of the frustrated system are studied and discussed in detail .",

    "the third term is dm interaction which results in the formation of skyrmions in the lattice and @xmath16 is the dm vector .",
    "this term is one type of lifshitz invariant that stabilizes a skyrmion state @xcite .",
    "the fourth term is zeeman energy , where the external field @xmath17 is along the thickness direction ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "@xmath23 mc steps are taken before measurements are performed . if not stated differently , the grid size @xmath24 and nn coupling is set to @xmath25 .",
    "it corresponds to exchange integral in the order of 10 mev @xcite .",
    "in sec a , we will first illustrate our simulation results including the phase diagram in @xmath26 plane , the comparison of energy between ferromagnetic ( fm ) , skyrmion ( skx ) and helical states ( h ) , and then provide both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the results . in sec b , we present the results on hysteresis loop and then discuss the results in detail .",
    "figure [ fig1]a shows the phase diagram in the @xmath27 plane . when nnn coupling is absent i.e. @xmath28 , the ground state is a helical state for @xmath29 as shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "the energy curve shows that the normal helical or multi - sublattice helical state has the lowest energy when the field is small , regardless of the magnitude of @xmath1 ( red circles , blue squares and black triangles for @xmath42 , respectively ) .",
    "the fm state is energy preferable in the large field limit . in the intermediate field regime , the skyrmion phase is energy preferable and the epw of skyrmions ( the horizontal window between two dashed lines with the same color ) increases as nnn coupling increases from 0 to 0.7 . as a short summary , both the phase diagram and energy comparison between various states explicitly show that a skyrmion lattice could exist and the energy - preferable window of skyrmions becomes even larger for @xmath43 . moreover , the energy changes are continuous while the first order derivative of energy with respect to field is not continuous at the transition fields , as shown by the dashed lines connecting the discrete symbols in fig .",

    ", it would weaken the nn coupling strength effectively . as a result",
    ", the effect of the dm interaction would be more pronounced and make the skyrmion more energetically favorable .",
    "on the other hand , the reduction of effective exchange coupling would lead to a reduction of skyrmion size @xcite , which is consistent with our observation as shown in fig . [ fig1]c .",

    "specifically , when @xmath63 , the nnn coupling is weak , hence ferromagnetic nn coupling and dm interaction dominate the other interactions in the system and the ground state is a helical state . when @xmath64 , the afm nnn coupling begins to surpass the nn coupling and compete with the dm interaction . without dm interaction ,",
    "the ground state is a 2-sublattice afm state @xcite , where spins in a row / column would align ferromagnetically with each other and the spins in a column / row align antiferromagnetically .",
