    "quadrangular b - spline surfaces are ubiquitous in geometric modeling .",
    "they are represented as tensor products of univariate b - spline functions .",
    "many of the properties of univariate b - splines extend naturally to this tensor representation .",
    "they are well suited to describe parts of shapes , with features organized along two different directions , as this is often the case for manufactured objects",
    ". however , the complete description of a shape by tensor product b - spline patches may require to intersect and trim them , resulting in a geometric model , which is inaccurate or difficult to manipulate or to deform .    to circumvent these difficulties",
    ", one can consider geometric models composed of quadrangular patches , glued together in a smooth way along their common boundary .",
    "continuity constraints on the tangent planes ( or on higher osculating spaces ) are imposed along the share edges . in this way",
    ", smooth surfaces can be generated from quadrilateral meshes by gluing several simple parametric surfaces . by specifying the topology of a quad(rilateral ) mesh @xmath0 and the geometric continuity along the shared edges via transition maps",
    ", we obtain a ( vector ) space of smooth b - spline functions on @xmath0 .",
    "our objective is to analyze this set of smooth b - spline functions on a quad mesh @xmath0 of arbitrary topology .",
    "in particular , we want to determine the dimension and a basis of the space of smooth functions composed of tensor product b - spline functions of bounded degree . by determining bases of these spaces , we can represent all the smooth parametric surfaces which satisfy the geometric continuity conditions on @xmath0",
    ". any such surface is described by its control points in this basis , which are the coefficients in the basis of the differentiable functions used in the parametrization .",
    "the construction of basis functions of a spline space has several applications . for visualization purposes , smooth deformations of these models can be obtained simply by changing their coefficients in the basis , while keeping satisfied the regularity constraints along the edges of the quad mesh .",
    "fitting problems for constructing smooth models that approximate point sets or satisfy geometric constraints can be transformed into least square problems on the coefficient vector of a parametric model and solved by standard linear algebra tools . knowing a basis of the space of smooth spline functions of bounded degree on a quad mesh can also be useful in isogeometric analysis . in this methodology , the basis functions are used to describe the geometry and to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations on the geometry .",
    "the explicit knowledge of a basis allows to apply galerkin type methods , which project the solution onto the space spanned by the basis functions .    in the last decades ,",
    "several works have been focusing on the construction of @xmath1 surfaces , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the construction applies for general quad meshes and is used to solve the interpolation problem of boundary curves . in these constructions ,",
    "symmetric geometric continuity constraints are used at the vertices of the mesh .",
    "much less work has been developed on the dimension analysis . in @xcite , a dimension formula and explicit basis constructions",
    "are given for polynomial patches of degree @xmath4 over a mesh with triangular or quadrangular cells .",
    "in @xcite , a similar result is obtained for the space of @xmath1 splines of bi - degree @xmath5 for rectangular decompositions of planar domains . the construction of basis functions for spaces of @xmath6 geometrically continuous functions restricted to two - patch domains , has been considered in @xcite . in @xcite , the approximation properties of the aforementioned spaces are explored , including constructions over multi - patch geometries motivated by applications in isogeometric analysis .    in this paper we analyze the space of @xmath1 splines on a general quad mesh @xmath0 , with 4-split macro - patch elements of bounded bi - degree .",
    "we describe explicit transition maps across shared edges , that satisfy conditions which ensure that the space of differentiable functions is ample on the quad mesh @xmath0 of arbitrary topology .",

    "we determine the dimension of this space for @xmath3 big enough and provide explicit constructions of basis functions attached respectively to vertices , edges and faces .",

    "examples of bases of @xmath1 splines of small degree for simple topological surfaces are detailed and illustrated by parametric surface constructions .",
    "the techniques developed in this paper for the study of geometrically smooth splines rely on the analysis of the syzygies of the glueing data , similarly to the approach used in @xcite for polynomial patches .",
    "however an important difference is that we consider here syzygies of spline functions with spline coefficients .",
    "the classical properties of syzygy modules over the ring of polynomials used in @xcite do not apply to spline functions .",
    "new results on syzygy modules over the ring of piecewise polynomial functions ( with one node and prescribed regularity ) are presented in sections [ sec : relation_syz ] , [ sec : syz_basis ] . in particular , proposition [ demi ] describes a family of gluing data with additional degrees of freedom , providing new possibilities to construct ample spaces of spline functions in low degree .",
    "the necessary notation and constrains from the case of polynomial patches are used in the course of the paper .",
    "but , properties of taylor maps exploited in @xcite are incoherent in our context . in our setting",
    ", the construction of the spline space requires to extend the results on these taylor maps to the context of macro - patches .",
    "sections [ sec : sepvert ] , [ sec : polybasis ] , [ sec : basis_edge ] present an alternative analysis adapted to our needs . exploiting these properties , vertex basis functions and face basis functions can then be constructed in the same way as in the polynomial case .",
