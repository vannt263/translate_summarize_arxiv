    "the competition between spin - singlet phases and antiferromagnetic order is a common feature of the phase diagrams for many strongly correlated systems , such as heavy fermion compounds , cuprates , and iron pnictides .",
    "depending on the context , the singlet order can correspond to unconventional superconductivity , charge , bond and current density waves , and static kondo singlets .",
    "the competition between singlet and triplet orders can cause an exotic quantum critical point or an intervening non - fermi liquid phase between two distinct broken symmetry states .",
    "a prototype case arises in heavy fermion metals , where non - fermi liquid properties arise in the quantum critical regime  @xcite .",
    "the latter is typically associated with a competition between the antiferromagnetic order of the local moments and the kondo - singlet or related phases , and a global phase diagram has been advanced to capture the variety of spin - singlet phases near the antiferromagnetic order  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to develop a general scheme for identifying competing singlet orders beginning from the magnetically ordered phase and vice versa .    in this paper , we will develop such a scheme for an itinerant system of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional massless dirac fermions which are strongly coupled to an o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model , by considering the interplay between fermionic degrees of freedom and the topological defects of antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "inside the antiferromagnetically ordered phase , the low energy spin wave excitations or goldstone modes are well described by an @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "however , it is tailored for capturing the smooth collective excitations , and will be impervious to the presence of competing singlet orders . for insulating systems described by generalized heisenberg models , it has been proposed that the topological excitations of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear sigma model can give rise to singlet valence bond solid order in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite . on the magnetically ordered side , competing singlet orders can reside inside the core of a topological but nonsingular skyrmion defect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the skyrmion is a finite energy excitation , the singlet orders can exist only as gapped , fluctuating quantities in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "by contrast , due to the vanishing of spin stiffness inside the paramagnetic phase , the skyrmion excitation gap disappears , causing an enormous degeneracy among topologically distinct ground states , labeled by different skyrmion numbers .",
    "therefore , inside the paramagnetic phase different types of singlet orders can be nucleated by breaking the skyrmion number conservation .     in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the skyrmion texture is well defined only inside the magnetically ordered phase , when the tunneling singularities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , namely the hedgehog and antihedgehog remain linearly confined .",
    "the skyrmion core can support several fluctuating translational symmetry breaking or intervalley orders for a single species of dirac fermion . for two or more species of dirac fermions it can also support translational symmetry preserving inter - species orders such as kondo singlets . ]",
    "the huge ground state degeneracy of the paramagnetic phase is generally lifted by the topological hedgehog singularities ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , which describe tunneling between ground states with different skyrmion numbers .",
    "the hedgehogs are generally accompanied by a dynamic berry phase term for the nonlinear sigma model  @xcite . within the coarse grained description of magnetic order , the berry phase carries important information regarding the quantized value of microscopic spin and",
    "determines the nature ( or reduced degeneracy ) of singlet order in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "based on this physical picture , an exotic continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct broken symmetry phases has been proposed  @xcite , which falls outside the paradigm of conventional landau - ginzburg theory . within the cp@xmath2 formulation of the sigma model , both magnetic ( higgs phase of gauge theory ) and paramagnetic spin peierls phases are confined states of an underlying compact u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "it has been suggested that only at the critical point the hedgehogs or monnopoles can be suppressed , leading to the deconfined or noncompact u(1 ) gauge field and spinon excitations .",
    "there are ongoing numerical studies on different microscopic models which are providing encouraging evidence for an exotic direct transition between two ordered states  @xcite .",
    "however , numerical works also find strong violations of hyperscaling and the issue of deconfined criticality is not yet settled .    how does the coupling between antiferromagnetic order parameter and itinerant fermions affect this scenario ? in the present work , we will be addressing this important question .",

    "the nonlinear sigma model field is described by the unit vector @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a coupling constant .",
    "this model will be generally augmented by a standard effective action for nonlinear sigma model .",
    "but , in this work we are mainly interested in computing the fermionic contribution to the effective action in the paramagnetic phase , when @xmath9 only displays short range correlations .",

    "we show that in the presence of an isolated hedgehog singularity @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the euclidean dirac operator @xmath23 supports two fermion zero modes of positive chirality ( valley index= @xmath24 ) with an antisymmetric locking of spin and sublattice indices ( @xmath25 ) . by contrast , two zero modes for the antihedhehog singularity possess opposite chirality ( valley index @xmath26 ) , but the same form of spin - sublattice locking .",
    "the source of opposite chirality is the spectral symmetry condition @xmath27 , and the zero modes are protected by callias index theorem  @xcite . _",
    "the fermion determinant vanishes due to these dynamic fermion zero modes , leading to an infinite action for an isolated tunneling event .",
    "consequently , the probability or fugacity of a single ( anti)hedgehog vanishes , providing a topological mechanism for suppressing tunneling events_. in the close proximity of magnetic quantum phase transition , we can model the neutral background field @xmath9 in terms of a _ dilute gas consisting of equal numbers of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs on average _ ( as their mean separation is controlled by the diverging correlation length ) , and the overlap between localized zero modes of opposite chirality determines the precise nature of singlet order . a pair of hedgehog and antihedgehog are shown in fig .

    "_ by averaging over hedgehog location and orientation within the o(3 ) group , we unambiguously show that the resulting singlet order parameter corresponds to the dynamic , complex dirac mass @xmath28 describing the translational symmetry breaking spin peierls order_. this method also provides valuable insight regarding the unconventional nature of quantum phase transition between two different broken symmetry phases .     along imaginary time direction . since hedgehog and antihedgehog are respectively the monopole and antimonopole of @xmath29 gauge field ,",
    "there will be quantized @xmath30 amount of @xmath29 flux through the @xmath31 plane , which is perpendicular to the direction of their separation .",
    "the situation is analogous to how @xmath30 berry flux passes through a plane perpendicular to the separation vector of left and right handed weyl points in a three dimensional weyl semimetal . on the paramagnetic side , but close to the magnetic quantum critical point , the separation @xmath32 varies as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the correlation length of nonlinear sigma model field . in the vicinity of quantum critical point ,",

    "_ since a hedgehog altogether leads to four zero modes , after averaging over the ensemble of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs we obtain a special form of quartic interaction within the zero mode subspace , which describes the strong competition between spin peierls order and kondo singlets ( inter species singlets)_. in particular for the above effective model , we find equally strong attractive interactions for @xmath44 type kondo singlets and @xmath45 type spin peierls bilinears .",
    "we also note that the relationship between the instantons of nonlinear sigma model and kondo singlet formation has been discussed for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models  @xcite .",

    "when massless quarks ( dirac fermions ) are coupled to a nonabelian gauge field , the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional dynamic dirac operator supports zero modes of definite chirality ( left or right handed ) in the presence of an instanton background  @xcite .",
    "this causes a vanishing fermion determinant , and the effective action for an isolated tunneling event becomes infinite .",
    "consequently , the probability of an isolated instanton vanishes .",
    "the presence of fermion zero mode of definite chirality provides a topological mechanism for breaking separate number conservation laws for right and left handed fermions , a phenomenon known as the axial anomaly .",
    "for a topologically trivial gauge field configuration , comprising of equal numbers of instantons and antiinstantons , the zero modes of opposite chirality ( respectively localized on the instantons and the antiinstantons ) can overlap .",
    "this overlap or hybridization of fermion zero modes with opposite chirality gives rise to a dynamic mass for the quarks , describing the breakdown of chiral symmetry  @xcite . depending on the number of flavors @xmath47 , the overlap of zero modes leads to @xmath48 fermion interaction vertex also known as thooft vertex . for @xmath49",
    "it corresponds to dirac mass . for @xmath50",
    "one obtains a quartic interaction very similar to the nambu - jona - lasinio model , which describes spontaneous breaking of flavor chiral symmetry .",
    "as emphasized in the previous subsections , the dynamic mass for one species of eight component dirac fermion arising due to the hybridization of two valleys also causes a breakdown of u(1 ) chiral symmetry ( separate number conservation laws for two valleys ) , which is a continuum description of discrete translational symmetry . for our @xmath50 model , the quartic interaction describes the competition between kondo singlet and spin peierls orders , which capture general forms of flavor chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "given these similarities , we will closely follow the methodology of qcd@xmath46 as described in the review works of refs .  , and also denote the hedgehog induced interaction vertex as the t hooft vertex .",
    "the instanton induced chiral symmetry breaking is quite general  @xcite , and can arise in many strongly interacting systems in different spatial dimensions .",
    "we will later discuss an example of a quantum spin hall system in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , where the instantons lead to superconducting phase on the quantum disordered side  @xcite , as well as some higher dimensional models where @xmath51-dimensional dirac fermions are coupled to a quantum disordered @xmath52 nonlinear sigma model  @xcite .",

    "this is in line with the case of a single species of eight component dirac fermions , for which we have also demonstrated that the paramagnetic phase supports spin peierls order ( out of several possible singlet orders ) , and the expectation value of this order parameter vanishes with a power law at the magnetic critical point .",
    "this suggests an unconventional critical point between two different ordered states due to suppression of tunneling and also an unified description where both antiferromagnetic and spin peierls orders should be treated on an equal footing as @xmath161.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can combine two different order parameters in terms of an o(5 ) nonlinear sigma model with an overall amplitude or coupling constant @xmath162 .",
    "interestingly , after integrating out the fermion fields , one obtains an o(5 ) nonlinear sigma model augmented by a level one topological wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term  @xcite .",
    "thus our dynamic zero mode calculations are providing some insight into the nature of unconventional critical point arising due to the wzw term .",
    "our instanton based calculations also suggest a relation between the level of wess - zumino - witten theory and the number of fermion zero modes ( two vs. four ) .",
    "additional work along this line is required for a better understanding of the critical theories .",
    "the methodology developed in this paper can be applied for computing the fermion determinant when @xmath163 nonlinear sigma model is coupled to massless dirac fermions in @xmath164 dimensional space - time .",
    "this provides a direct way to obtain a competing o(2 ) order parameter , which generally anticommutes with the vector order described by the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "therefore , we suspect this methodology to be relevant for understanding the @xmath165 nonlinear sigma model with a wess - zumino - witten term  @xcite",
    ". an application along this line will be to replace the antiferromagnetic order by a quantum spin hall order parameter in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions  @xcite , which couples to the dirac fermions as @xmath166 .",
    "for such a model , a hedgehog defect gives rise to zero modes for both valleys .",
    "by contrast , the antihedgehog leads to zero modes for conjugate spinor fields . by extending our calculation on the quantum disordered side within a dilute gas approximation",
    ", we can immediately show the emergence of a superconducting order parameter .",
    "however , we emphasize the superconducting mass term will have a frequency - momentum dependent form factor . in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions , antiferromagnetic hedgehogs are static defects and zero modes are actually zero energy eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "similarly spin peierls order parameter is also a three component vector and can support zero energy states . by performing a calculation along the lines of this paper",
    ", we can show the nucleation of competing orders and justify an o(6 ) theory with wzw term  @xcite .",
    "this method will also be useful for providing nonperturbative insight into various quenched disorder problems involving dirac fermions . particularly in the context of disordered three dimensional topological insulators , superconductors as well as",
    "dirac semimetals , three dimensional dirac fermions are coupled to different types of replica or supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models ( describing diffusons and cooperons ) . for such models ,",
    "the fermion zero modes actually represent physical zero energy states with nontrivial multifractal properties . how they provide a nonperturbative framework for obtaining topological invariant of a disordered insulating state and also their relationship to a direct quantum phase transitions between two topologically distinct insulating states  @xcite",
    "will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "another interesting direction will be to extend our work to a finite density of dirac fermions , which can stabilize a translational symmetry breaking ( fflo ) superconducting state in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we have developed a theoretical framework for studying competing singlet orders induced by topological defects of antiferromagnetic order parameter in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional itinerant system . for making progress ,",
    "we have modeled the itinerant system by dirac fermions which are strongly coupled to the quantum disordered o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model .",
    "our main goal was to compute the fermion determinant in the presence of a fluctuating or short range antiferromagnetically ordered background , which was built out of an equal number of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs .",
    "the salient points of our work are summarized below .    on the magnetically ordered side , the topological tunneling singularities ,",
    "also known as the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs are linearly confined , and the skyrmion number conservation gives rise to a continuity equation for the skyrmion current .",
    "based on the perturbative gradient expansion method , we have shown that an appropriate fermion current ( denoted as chiral current ) equals the skyrmion current with a multiplicative factor determined by the number of fermion flavors .",
    "this has allowed us to identify an induced chiral fermion number for the skyrmion excitations , which acts as the generator of the u(1 ) chiral symmetry .",
    "for the problem at hand , the chiral symmetry is a continuum description of the underlying discrete translational symmetry on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the identification of the skyrmion number as the generator of chiral symmetry helps us to classify all the relevant competing orders . if the nonlinear sigma model is used to describe the collective mode of an underlying single species of eight component dirac fermion ( due to two valleys , two sublattices and two spin indices ) , the relevant singlet orders mix two valleys and break translational symmetry .",
    "by contrast , for the kondo - heiseberg model , the coupling between the itinerant fermion and the antiferromagnetically ordered local moments can lead to translational symmetry preserving ( intravalley ) kondo singlet states as additional competing orders .",
    "we have demonstrated the topological mechanism through which the hedgehogs pick out a specific competing order . in the hedgehog background , the dynamic dirac operator possesses zero modes of definite chirality ( valley quantum number ) , leading to the anomalous violation of chiral current conservation law inside the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the emergence of fermion zero mode and its stability is shown to be a consequence of the callias index theorem .",
    "the fermion zero modes cause vanishing fugacity for isolated tunneling events and provide a topological mechanism for suppressing the tunneling events , which may lead to a deconfined quantum critical point .",
    "based on the zero mode structure , we have identified a similarity between our ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional qcd .",
    "_ for a topologically neutral background field with an equal number of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs , the overlap between localized zero modes of opposite chirality determines the precise form of the emergent singlet order_. in the close vicinity of magnetic critical point , when instantons can be treated within a dilute gas approximations , we have explicitly derived the overlap between the zero modes .",
    "_ for a single species of four component fermion , we show how the overlap between zero modes unambiguously selects the dynamic complex dirac mass or spin peierls order over the other charge and current density wave orders_. at a technical level this has been identified with the t hooft interaction vertex discussed in the context of qcd .",
    "the size of chiral symmetry breaking spin - peierls condensate is proportional to the density of states of the fermion zero modes and it follows an analog of the banks - casher formula for qcd . for the kondo - heisenberg model , there are two species of four component fermions , and the t hooft vertex describes a quartic fermion interaction , which captures the ensuing competition between the spin peierls order and kondo singlet formation .",
    "we have also discussed several other applications of our theoretical methods for interacting as well as disordered problems .    this work has been supported in part by jqi - nsf - pfc and lps - mpocmtc ( p.g . ) , and by the nsf grant dmr-1611392 and the robert a. welch foundation grant no .",

    "if there are @xmath47 flavors of dirac fermions , we have seen there are @xmath48 two component zero modes of positive chirality ( + valley index ) localized on the hedgehogs in addition to @xmath48 negative chirality ( - valley ) zero modes localized on the antihedgehogs .",
    "therefore , the hedgehog creation operator will couple to a nonlocal thooft interaction vertex with @xmath48-fermion operators .",
    "we have already seen that for @xmath49 , the hedgehog is coupled to only two fermions operators , which leads to the dirac mass ( peierls order ) . for @xmath50 we will derive the relevant four fermion vertex by following refs .  .",
