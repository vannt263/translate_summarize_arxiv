    "the recent and ongoing discovery of extrasolar giant planets has stimulated renewed interest in the theory of planet formation ( e.g. mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy , cochran , & mayor 1999 ; vogt et al .",
    "in particular the discovery of giant planets close to their central stars has led to the idea that they migrated inwards due to gravitational interaction with the gaseous disc .",
    "previous studies of the interaction between a protoplanet and a laminar but viscous disc [ papaloizou & lin ( 1984 ) ; lin & papaloizou ( 1986 , 1993 ) ; bryden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; dangelo , henning & kley ( 2002 ) ] indicate that a protoplanet in the jovian mass range will open a gap and that the torques exerted through the disc protoplanet interaction can produce inward orbital migration . however , the effect of the turbulence producing the anomalous viscosity has yet to be taken into account .",
    "the origin of this turbulence was uncertain until balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) provided an explanation for its origin through the operation of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "improved computational resources now makes it feasible to consider three dimensional simulations of turbulent discs interacting with protoplanets .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers aimed at developing and interpreting such simulations . in this first paper",
    "we focus on the turbulent disc models prior to the introduction of a perturbing protoplanet .",
    "the effect of introducing the protoplanet will be considered in a companion paper ( nelson & papaloizou ( 2002 )  hereafter paper ii ) . to ease computational requirements",
    "we adopt cylindrical disc models with no vertical stratification . for this first study",
    "we assume that the disc is adequately ionized throughout so that ideal mhd applies and consider models with zero net magnetic flux .",
    "we extend an initial study by steinacker & papaloizou ( 2002 ) ( hereafter sp ) to consider a wider range of models with varying disc size aspect ratio and resolution in the context of classical ` @xmath4 ' viscous disc theory ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this is because in addition to providing the most common and simple conceptual framework for disc modeling it still remains the main contact with observations ( balbus & papaloizou 1999 ) .",
    "we here focus on time averages of disc quantities such as the @xmath5 stress and radial inflow velocity and study the extent to which stable behaviour of these quantities relates to classical disc theory .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the basic equations and model set up in  [ s1 ] .",
    "we describe the numerical procedure in  [ s2 ] and our numerical results in  [ s3a ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ s6 ] .",
    "the governing equations for mhd written in a frame rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the unit vector in the vertical direction are : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the fluid velocity , pressure , density , magnetic field , and potential , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 contains contributions due to gravity and the centrifugal potential @xmath13 we use a locally isothermal equation of state @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the sound speed which is specified as a fixed function of @xmath16    the models investigated may be described as cylindrical discs ( e.g. hawley 2001 ) . adopting cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 the gravitational potential is taken to depend on @xmath18 alone , so that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the central mass , @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , and the second term represents the centrifugal potential where applicable .",
    "thus the cylindrical disc models do not include a full treatment of the disc vertical structure .",
    "models of this type are employed due to the high computational overhead that would be required to resolve fully the disc vertical structure of a stratified model .    in this paper",
    "we consider the time dependent evolution and turbulent state that is set up in five models that we label as a , b , c , d , and e. these are all initiated with zero net magnetic flux in both vertical and azimuthal directions which is conserved for the duration of the simulations . as in sp periodic boundary conditions",
    "were used in the vertical and azimuthal directions , and each of the models has a radial computational domain @xmath22 in which is embedded a central keplerian domain @xmath23 where the angular velocity @xmath24 and which becomes unstable due to the mri .",
    "interior and exterior to this keplerian domain , adjacent to the inner and outer rigid radial boundaries , there exist regions in which the angular velocity profile is non keplerian .",
    "these are described below .",
    "the relevant model parameters are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "dimensionless units of length and time are adopted such that @xmath25 and @xmath26    the angular velocity profile is chosen to be stable to the mri in the boundary domains ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , the inner one of which can be thought of as modeling the boundary layer between star and disc . for the models considered here , we adopted @xmath29 with constant of proportionality such that @xmath30 ( models a , b , e ) or @xmath31 ( models c , d ) , apart from in the inner boundary domain where @xmath32 in the keplerian domain the initial density was such that @xmath33 for all models . in models a , c , and d the angular velocity was initially constant in both boundary domains .",
    "in models b and e we took @xmath34 in the inner boundary domain . models a , c , and d were initiated with initial toroidal fields contained within the keplerian domain while models b and e were initiated with poloidal fields . as in sp the initial magnetic field was given by @xmath35 with the integer @xmath36 being the number of @xmath37 cycles .",
    "the index @xmath38 indicates either the vertical or the toroidal field component with the corresponding unit vector @xmath39 for toroidal fields @xmath40 is constant while for vertical fields @xmath41 the magnetic field was applied in an annulus within the keplerian domain with inner and outer bounding radii @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the normalization of @xmath40 was chosen such that the initial magnetic energy in the keplerian domain expressed in units of the volume integrated pressure there was @xmath44 for models a , c , and d , @xmath45 for model b , and @xmath46 for model e. as the calculations proceed the magnetic field is seen to diffuse throughout the keplerian domain until it is more or less fully magnetised , leading to a final turbulent state that is described in subsequent sections .",
    "model e was initiated in the inertial frame with an azimuthal domain of extent @xmath47 , and is the disc model used to study disc - planet interaction in paper ii .",
    "this was run up to time @xmath48 when it had attained a fully turbulent state . for the purpose of studying the interaction between a turbulent protostellar disc and an embedded protoplanet , the azimuthal domain for this model",
    "was then extended to @xmath37 by stacking six of the @xmath47 sectors together . a transformation to a rotating frame with @xmath49",
    "was carried out and the evolution continued .",
    "some results obtained at this stage are described below .",
    "we found no significant dependence of the evolution of the models on @xmath50 or the extent of the @xmath51 domain once the latter exceeded @xmath52    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      the numerical scheme that we employ is based on a spatially second  order accurate method that computes the advection using the monotonic transport algorithm ( van leer 1977 ) .",
    "the mhd section of the code uses the method of characteristics constrained transport ( mocct ) as outlined in hawley & stone ( 1995 ) and implemented in the zeus code .",
    "the code has been developed from a version of nirvana originally written by u. ziegler ( see sp , ziegler & rdiger ( 2000 ) , and references therein )",
    "we now present numerical results for the evolution of models a ",
    "e into a saturated turbulent state and characterize their average evolutionary behaviour . to do this we use spatial and temporal averages of the state variables as indicated below .      in order to describe average properties of the turbulent models , we use quantities that are both vertically and azimuthally averaged over the @xmath53 domain ( e.g. hawley 2000 ) and in some cases an additional time average .",
    "the vertical and horizontal average of @xmath54 is defined through @xmath55    below the average is taken over the full @xmath37 in azimuth . if a smaller domain is used @xmath37 should be replaced by the extent of this domain in what follows below in this section . in practice",
    "we have found that the results are independent of the size of the @xmath51 domain , with the smallest azimuthal domain that we have considered being @xmath52    the vertically and azimuthally averaged continuity equation ( [ cont ] ) may then be written @xmath56 where the disc surface density is given by @xmath57 ( note that in performing the averaging the basic equations are integrated over the vertical and azimuthal domains without first multiplying by the density . )",
    "the vertically and azimuthally averaged maxwell and reynolds stresses , are respectively defined as follows : @xmath58 and @xmath59 here the velocity fluctuations @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined through , @xmath62 @xmath63 the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath4 stress parameter appropriate to the total stress is defined by @xmath64 the vertically and azimuthally averaged azimuthal component of the equation of motion ( [ mot ] ) can be written in the form @xmath65 [ see balbus & papaloizou ( 1999 ) ] . here",
    "@xmath66 is the specific angular momentum . using equation ( [ cona ] ) , equation([mota ] ) may also be written as @xmath67 note too that the averages may be extended without change of formalism to incorporate a time average such that for any quantity @xmath68 where the time average is carried out over an interval @xmath69 centered on the time @xmath70 and this is incorporated into the definition of @xmath71    under quasi - steady state conditions in the mean , if the time average is carried out over a sufficiently long interval , we should be able to neglect the time variation of the mean specific angular momentum @xmath72 then , as in the normal viscous disc theory , we expect to have an expression for the mean radial velocity of the form @xmath73      the time dependent evolution of the total magnetic energy in the keplerian domain expressed in units of the volume integrated pressure , @xmath74 is plotted as a function of time for model a in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this model was run for up to @xmath75 time units .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath76 orbits at @xmath77 @xmath78 orbits at @xmath79 and @xmath80 orbits at @xmath81 the initial value of the ratio of the total magnetic energy to volume integrated pressure @xmath82 was @xmath44 for model a and all others initiated with toroidal fields .",
    "after the onset of the mri , some loss of the rather high initial magnetic energy due to reconnection occurs , and a relaxed turbulent state is attained after about ten orbits at the outer boundary of the keplerian domain .",
    "the statistical properties of this do not depend on the initial conditions for models with zero net flux ( see sp and below ) .",
    "the stress parameter @xmath4 , defined in equation ( [ alphaeqn ] ) , volume averaged over the keplerian domain is plotted as a function of time for model a in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "mean values are typically @xmath83    we now examine how the stress parameter @xmath4 varies in space and time . to do this",
    "we consider time averages .",
    "time averages of the stress parameter @xmath4 are plotted as a function of dimensionless radius for model a in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "time averaging ends at times @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . in each case the time averaging starts at @xmath89 although a snapshot of @xmath4 may reveal quite large variations ( see figure [ fig13 ] below for model c , and also sp ) after quite a short time a stable picture emerges .",
    "this is apparent after time averaging over an interval as short as @xmath90 units , which represents 2 orbits at the inner boundary and only @xmath91 orbits at the outer boundary .",
    "although from figure  [ fig3 ] there is still some erratic behaviour visible for an averaging of @xmath92 time units , for averaging periods exceeding @xmath78 units , or one orbital period at the outer boundary of the active domain , the time averaged stress parameter appears to be a reasonably smooth function of @xmath16 the variation of the time averaged @xmath4 in the active domain is between @xmath93 and @xmath94 these values are typical of those seen in local shearing box simulations starting with magnetic fields with zero net flux [ hawley , gammie & balbus ( 1996 ) ; brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; brandenburg ( 1998 ) ; fleming , stone & hawley ( 2000 ) ] .",
    "smaller values are obtained near the inner boundary .",
    "this is probably because magnetic field has not yet diffused to the inner boundary so that a long term turbulent steady state has not been reached there ( note that the initial magnetic field was applied in an annulus away from the boundary domains as described in section  [ s1 ] ) .    in general the time",
    "averaged stress parameter @xmath95 and because of the relatively small fluctuations in time of @xmath96 , also the time averaged stress itself attains a stable pattern after only a short period of time averaging .",
    "on the other hand , a stable pattern for the time averaged radial velocity takes significantly longer to attain .",
    "this is because from viscous disc theory we expect a characteristic value @xmath97 a snapshot of the @xmath98 averaged over the vertical and azimuthal domain is typically between one and two order of magnitudes higher , corresponding to large temporal fluctuations in that quantity ( see also sp ) .",
    "we present a snapshot of @xmath99 plotted as a function of radius for model a at the specific time @xmath100 in figure [ fig3a ] ( where @xmath101 is the vertical extent of the computational domain ) .",
    "the temporal fluctuations in this quantity are found to be small , and representing the density averaged over the azimuthal and vertical domains it indicates some mass accretion towards the inner regions ( see also figure  [ fig21 ] for model e below ) .",
    "a snapshot of the product of the vertically and azimuthally averaged values of @xmath98 with @xmath102 is plotted as a function of dimensionless radius for model a at time @xmath100 in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this quantity is related to the instantaneous radial mass flux .",
    "characteristic values of the averaged @xmath98 are seen to be much larger than those expected from classical viscous disc theory which are recovered only after a long period of time averaging .    to show this , we plot the product of the time averages of the vertically and azimuthally averaged values of @xmath98 with the time averaged @xmath102 as a function of dimensionless radius in figure [ fig5 ] for model a. the averages end at times @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath100 .",
    "the time averaging starts at @xmath89 even the longest two averages over @xmath103 and @xmath104 time units , although indicating magnitudes comparable to those expected from viscous disc theory , deviate significantly .",
    "the shortest average over @xmath105 time units is very different in character .",
    "from this we conclude that periods of time up to @xmath106 orbital periods at the outer boundary of the active domain are required to obtain radial velocities that can be compared with viscous disc theory , and then the comparison can be moderately successful for the times over which averages can be taken here .",
    "we illustrate this by plotting the longest time average of the vertically and azimuthally averaged values of @xmath98 with the time averaged @xmath102 as a function of dimensionless radius for model a in figure [ fig6 ] . the value of this quantity that we obtained from equation ( [ motad ] ) , using the time averaged stress @xmath107 obtained in the simulation , the keplerian value for @xmath108 , and using numerical differentiation is also plotted as the solid line .",
    "this latter quantity varies somewhat erratically because of the numerical differentiation , but nonetheless the general agreement is reasonable .",
    "it is expected that models with initially zero net flux should attain similar steady states independent of initial conditions , disc thickness and size . to investigate this we considered model b which started from a vertical field and had outer boundary of the active domain at @xmath109 the magnetic energy in the keplerian domain expressed in units of the volume integrated pressure",
    "is plotted as a function of time for model b in figure [ fig7 ] . as for model",
    "a and all others to be presented , this settles down to a turbulent state with @xmath110    the stress parameter @xmath4 , volume averaged over the keplerian domain , is plotted as a function of time for model b in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "this also takes on similar values and has similar behaviour to other models .",
    "the behaviour of the time averages of the stress parameter @xmath4 are plotted as a function of dimensionless radius for model b in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "these end at times @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the time averaging starts at @xmath115 the shortest average over only @xmath116 time units , gives erratic behaviour and even negative values .",
    "however , for those taken over more than @xmath117 units a smooth stable behaviour is obtained with typical values of @xmath118 .",
    "but note that there are also long term cyclic trends which are seen in the time averages ( see also brandenburg 1998 ) .",
    "we now describe models c and d. these models had an increased sound speed such that @xmath119 further , model d had @xmath92 percent larger resolution in azimuth than model c in order to test the effects of azimuthal resolution .",
    "the magnetic energy in the keplerian domain expressed in units of the volume integrated pressure is shown as a function of time for models c and d in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "the behaviour of these models is very similar and again we find typical values @xmath120 for this quantity .",
    "volume averages of the stress parameter @xmath4 in the keplerian domain for these models are plotted as a function of time in figure [ fig11 ] . again these models behave similarly .",
    "we plot time averages of the stress parameter @xmath4 as a function of dimensionless radius for model c in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "these are taken at times @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the time averaging starts from @xmath125 a similar plot for model d is given in figure [ fig12a ] . here",
    "the averages are taken at times @xmath126 solid line , and @xmath127 dashed line .",
    "the time averaging starts from @xmath128    the time averages of @xmath4 are more uniform in the thicker disc models c and d with stable behaviour being attained for averaging periods exceeding @xmath129 orbital periods at the outer boundary of the keplerian domain .",
    "the more uniform behaviour may occur because the shorter viscous time in these cases enables a better relaxation of the disc to a state where memory of initial conditions is lost .    to compare with the time averages a snapshot of the stress parameter @xmath4 plotted as a function of radius for model c at time @xmath124",
    "is shown in figure [ fig13 ] .    to investigate the applicability of equation ( [ motad ] ) , we plot the time average of the vertically and azimuthally averaged values of @xmath98 with the time averaged @xmath102 as a function of dimensionless radius for model d in figure [ fig51 ] .",
    "the value of this quantity that we obtained from equation ( [ motad ] ) , using the time averaged stress , the keplerian value for @xmath108 and using numerical differentiation is also plotted as the solid line . as found for model",
    "a this quantity varies somewhat erratically because of the numerical differentiation , but there is schematic agreement .",
    "the time average was taken over eight orbital periods at the outer boundary of the keplerian domain which is not enough to reduce the fluctuations in the radial velocity which can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than the mean to a very low level .",
    "this may require much longer averaging times comparable to the viscous timescale which are not feasible to consider here .",
    "this model was initiated with a poloidal magnetic field and had a value of @xmath130 throughout the keplerian domain .",
    "the inner edge of the active keplerian domain was located at @xmath131 and the outer edge at @xmath132 , with the azimuthal extent being @xmath133 , so this model has the largest radial extent that we consider in this work .",
    "this model is used in paper ii to study the interaction between a mhd turbulent disc and a giant protoplanet .",
    "the temporal evolution of the magnetic energy in units of the volume integrated pressure is shown in figure  [ fig15 ] .",
    "this quantity saturates at a value of @xmath120 in the final turbulent state , similar to the previous runs described .",
    "the volume averaged stress parameter , @xmath4 , is plotted as a function of time in figure  [ fig16 ] , and shows similar behaviour to the previous runs described , saturating at a value of @xmath134 .",
    "the radial variation of the time averaged stress parameter @xmath4 is shown in figure  [ fig17 ] , with the solid line denoting the total @xmath4 , and the dashed line denoting the magnetic contribution . the process of time averaging was initiated at a time @xmath48 and completed at @xmath135 .",
    "this time interval corresponds to 66.7 orbits at @xmath136 and 3.5 orbits at @xmath132 .    at a time of @xmath48 ,",
    "the disc model e was used to construct a model with an azimuthal extent of @xmath137 for the purpose of studying disc - planet interactions , ( whilst the original model e run was continued until @xmath138 ) .",
    "this was achieved by simply patching six identical copies of the @xmath47 model together to make a full @xmath137 disc , ensuring of course that the azimuthal periodicity condition for the @xmath47 models were properly utilised to construct the @xmath137 disc .",
    "in addition , the disc model was transformed from being in an inertial frame to a rotating frame with @xmath139 .",
    "this value of @xmath50 corresponds to the angular velocity of material in circular keplerian orbit at a radius of @xmath140 .",
    "we have checked that transforming the models from an inertial to a rotating frame , and/or increasing the azimuthal extent of a model by patching together identical copies , have no significant effect on the statistical properties of the turbulence .",
    "figures  [ fig18 ] and [ fig19 ] show the magnetic energy ( in units of the volume integrated pressure ) and the volume integrated stress parameter @xmath4 as functions of time for model e when transformed into the rotating frame ( dotted line ) and in the inertial frame ( solid line ) .",
    "small divergences in the numerical values are observed , since the code is now evolving a different _ numerical _ solution , but the statistical properties remain very similar .",
    "an almost identical situation arises when increasing the azimuthal domain from @xmath47 to @xmath137 .",
    "a greyscale plot of the density at the vertical midplane of the disc is shown in figure  [ fig20 ] corresponding to a time @xmath48 .",
    "the usual trailing waves generated by the turbulence can clearly be seen in this figure .",
    "the variation of the azimuthally averaged midplane density as a function of radius is plotted in figure  [ fig21 ] .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the density distribution at time @xmath48 , whereas the dashed line shows the initial values at @xmath141 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that some inward mass accretion has occurred .",
    "we have presented a study of cylindrical disc models in which a central domain in keplerian rotation is unstable to the mri .",
    "models of varying disc size and aspect ratio @xmath0 were considered .",
    "they were initiated with small scale magnetic fields with zero net flux .",
    "conservation of poloidal and toroidal flux ensures that this situation is maintained throughout the simulations .",
    "input of flux through the boundaries which remain magnetically inactive does not occur .",
    "the models all attain a turbulent state , with statistical properties that do not depend on the initial conditions which is expected for genuine dynamo action .",
    "as these models have been prepared for studies of disc protoplanet interaction we have focused on relating the properties of the turbulent models to classical viscous disc theory [ shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) ] .",
    "this is an important issue , because besides providing a conceptual framework for disc studies , as emphasized by balbus & papaloizou ( 1999 ) it is still the main contact between disc theory and observations .",
    "all models were found to attain a turbulent state with volume averaged stress parameter @xmath142 and mean @xmath143 we also found that the same results were obtained in a rotating frame and in agreement with hawley ( 2000 ) they were independent of the extent of the azimuthal domain when this exceeded @xmath52    the vertically and azimuthally averaged stress parameter showed large radial fluctuations .",
    "time averaging for a period exceeding @xmath2 orbital periods was found to significantly reduce them . for models with @xmath144 stable variations with radius of a factor of two",
    "were then noted whereas for models with @xmath145 less variation was seen .",
    "variations in the time averaged quantities are most probably due to some memory of initial conditions which take up to a viscous time to eradicate , this being shorter for the thicker disc models .",
    "the higher resolution thicker disc model tended to have larger values of @xmath4 than a lower resolution counterpart , which may reflect a residual dependence on resolution ( see brandenburg et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the vertically and azimuthally averaged radial velocity showed large radial and temporal fluctuations of up to two orders of magnitude larger than the inflow velocity expected from classical viscous disc theory ( see also sp ) .",
    "time averaging for a period of at least @xmath3 orbital periods at the outer boundary of the keplerian domain was required to reveal values of a magnitude comparable to the expected viscous inflow velocity .",
    "comparison with the value derived from the averaged stress using viscous disc theory yielded schematic agreement for feasible averaging times .",
    "it is likely that very long averaging times are needed to eliminate residual fluctuations in the mean radial velocity and that such an averaging operation may only be possible for a very quiet and thin disc that has relaxed to a long term statistical steady state .",
    "the behaviour described above must be borne in mind when considering laminar disc simulations with anomalous navier  stokes viscosity [ e.g. bryden et al ( 1999 ) ; kley ( 1999 ) ; lubow , seibert & artymowicz ( 1999 ) ; dangelo et al ( 2002 ) ] . there , radial inflow velocities produced by the viscosity produce phenomena like mass flow through gaps when a protoplanet is embedded in a disc , due to the viscosity acting as a constantly acting source of friction . from the above discussion",
    "we might expect different dynamical behaviour in the gap region induced by a protoplanet in a genuinely turbulent disc ( see paper ii ) , where the instantaneous velocity fluctuations are much larger than the time averaged radial velocities arising from the turbulence  induced angular momentum transport .",
    "more generally the classical viscous disc theory can not apply to a disc undergoing rapid changes due to external perturbation .",
    "it can only be used to describe the parts of the disc that are in a quasi - steady condition for long enough for appropriate averaging to be carried out .",
    "we acknowledge john hawley , steve balbus , adriane steinacker , and caroline terquem for useful discussions .",
    "the computations reported here were performed using the uk astrophysical fluids facility ( ukaff ) and the grand consortium supercomputing facility ."
