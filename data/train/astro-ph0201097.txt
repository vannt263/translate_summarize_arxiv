    "a substantial body of astrophysical evidence supports the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) in the halo of our galaxy , in particular in the form of new , yet undiscovered , weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite .",
    "one of the leading candidates is the neutralino predicted by the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "+ following early experimental works  @xcite , a superfluid  detector has recently been proposed @xcite for direct dark matter search .",
    "monte carlo simulations have shown that a high granularity detector , a matrix of superfluid  cells , would allow to reach a high rejection factor against background events , leading to a low false event rate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a full estimation of the neutralino ( @xmath0 ) event rate , within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , in order to compare with background event rate obtained by monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the complementarity with existing devices , both for direct and indirect detection , will be shown .",
    "the elementary component of mache3 is the superfluid  cell  @xcite .",
    "it is a small copper cubic box ( @xmath1 ) filled with superfluid  in the b - phase .",
    "this ultra low temperature device ( t @xmath2 ) presents a low detection threshold ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "an experimental test of such a prototype cell has been done at crtbt in june 2001 .",
    "preliminary results @xcite show that a threshold value down to @xmath4 has been achieved , and that a stability of the order of one week , at t @xmath2 , has been obtained .",
    "+ the final version of the detector will be a matrix of 1000 cells of @xmath5 each .",
    "the idea is to take advantage both on the energy loss measurement and the correlation among the cells to discriminate neutralino events from those of background ( neutrons , @xmath6-rays  and muons ) .",
    "the design of the matrix has been optimized , with a monte carlo simulation @xcite . in the preferred configuration , a @xmath7 detector ,",
    "the false event rate has been shown to be as small as @xmath8 for neutron events . ] and @xmath9 for muon events @xcite .",
    "background from @xmath6-ray  events needs to be taken into account .",
    "energy loss measurement and correlation among the cells within a @xmath7 detector allows to obtain a rejection up to 99.8% for @xmath10 @xmath6-rays @xcite .",
    "additionnal internal tag on @xmath6-rays may be obtained using a new matrix configuration in which two neigbouring cells share a common copper wall , thus greatly improving correlation factor while reducing the amount of copper used .",
    "monte carlo studies are under way @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6-ray contamination is to be estimated in the forthcoming months for a multicellular prototype matrix . + in order to compare these false event rates with the expected neutralino rate , only muons and neutrons will be taken into account in the following . we shall recall that neutrons are usually considered as the ultimate background noise for this type of search , as they interact _ a priori _ like wimps .",
    "several properties of  make this nucleus a promising candidate for a sensitive medium for direct dm search .",
    "* a ) * concerning background rejection , and as outlined in @xcite , the neutron capture process offers the possibility to discriminate neutron and @xmath0  event , when considering a @xmath11 granular detector .",
    "compton cross - section being small ( @xmath12 ) , the interactions with @xmath6-rays  will be minimized . eventually , as explained in @xcite , superfluid",
    "is produced with an extremely high purity , the only solute being  in a negligible fraction .",
    "consequently , no contamination from radioactive materials is expected in the sensitive medium .",
    "of course , natural radioactivity from external materials ( @xmath13 , ... ) has to be taken into account , by a careful selection of these materials .",
    "* b ) * concerning neutralino detection the advantage is twofold .",
    "first , the maximum recoil energy does only slightly depend on the neutralino mass , due to the fact that the target nucleus ( @xmath14 ) is much lighter than the incoming @xmath0  ( @xmath15 ) , considering latest results from collider experiments @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the recoil energy range needs to be studied only below @xmath16 , see @xcite .",
    "second ,  being a 1/2 spin nucleus , an  detector will be sensitive mainly to axial interaction , making this device complementary to existing ones , as shown below .",
    "in fact , the axial interaction is largely dominant ( up to three orders of magnitude ) in all the susy region associated with a substantial elastic cross - section @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological study has been done with the darksusy code @xcite , within the framework of the phenomenological supersymmetric model , namely with the following free parameters : @xmath17    with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) the higgsino ( gaugino ) mass parameter , @xmath20 the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath21 the cp - odd higgs boson mass , @xmath22 the common scalar mass and @xmath23 the soft trilinear coupling parameters .",
    "+ apart from @xmath23 chosen at fixed zero value , as their influence is expected to be negligible , all the parameters have been scanned on a large range , with a variable number of steps ( tab .  [",
    "tab : scan ] ) .",
    "this scan of the free parameters corresponds to a total number of supersymmetric ( susy ) models of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "+ we shall suppose all through this work the neutralino ( @xmath0 ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle , as the particle making up the bulk of galactic cold dm .",
    "each susy model is then checked not to be excluded by collider experiments  @xcite , including @xmath25 limit .",
    "the nest step , the evaluation of the relic density , is the key point of any dark matter calculations .",
    "given the number of free parameters ( 5 in our case ) , the allowed susy parameter space may be extremely large , leading to a @xmath0  relic density ranging on up to five orders of magnitude @xcite . in order to exclude susy models giving a @xmath0  relic density too far away from the estimated matter density in the universe @xcite",
    "( @xmath26 ) , only models with @xmath27 in the following range are considered : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalized hubble expansion rate  @xcite .",
    "+ the lower limit comes from the condition that the neutralino relic density has to be at least greater that the baryonic density , and the upper limit is a conservative limit so that @xmath0  do not give a density greater than the universe allows for a slightly looser selection . ] .",
    "the susy model is thus checked to really provide a good non - baryonic dark matter candidate .",
    "we follow @xcite in the choice of the `` cosmologically interesting '' range of @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noticed that this loose selection allows to exclude a large number of models in our susy scan .",
    "for further details concerning the calculation of the @xmath0  relic density , we refer the reader to @xcite .    as the detection on earth",
    "is concerned , a galactic halo model has to be considered . in the following",
    ", standard parameters have been used , in a spherical isothermal halo distribution , with a local density ( @xmath30 ) and an average velocity  ( @xmath31 ) , with the following values : @xmath32    these parameters are widely used for dark matter detection computations , see @xcite for instance .",
    "no clumpy galactic dark matter structures @xcite are considered hereafter , since the effect is expected to be small both for direct detection and neutrino telescopes , in which the signal depends on the local halo density , as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "as early recognized by goodman and witten @xcite , the interaction between neutralino and quarks may be either spin dependent or spin independent , involving different feynman diagrams @xcite . in the general wimp case ,",
    "the allowed interactions are : vectorial , axial and scalar .",
    "the neutralino being a majorana fermion , the vectorial interaction vanishes , leaving two classes of interaction  : scalar and axial , the first one being spin independent , the second spin dependent and obviously requiring a non - zero spin nucleus .",
    "being a light 1/2 spin nucleus , a medium made of such nuclei will be sensitive only to axial interaction , as shown in @xcite .",
    "+ using the darksusy code , the @xmath0-  spin dependent cross - section has been evaluated .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0-quark elastic scattering amplitude is done at the tree - level , via an exchange of squark or @xmath33 .",
    "the amplitude on nucleon ( @xmath34 ) is then evaluated by adding the contribution of each quark ( @xmath35 ) , weighted by the quark contents of the nucleon : @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the quark contents of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "+ the axial cross - section on  is then given by : @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the spin contents of the  nucleus ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the reduced mass and @xmath43 the ground state angular momentum of the  nucleus .",
    "figure  [ mac3:xs ] presents the cross - section on  as a function of the @xmath0  mass .",
    "it can be seen that , for susy models not excluded by collider experiments and giving a relic density within the range of interest , a cross - section as high as @xmath44 can be obtained for @xmath45  neutralino .",
    "+ using the cross - section , the @xmath0  event rate ( @xmath46 ) has been evaluated for a @xmath47  matrix , for comparison with the background rate previously evaluated  @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 with @xmath30 the local halo density and @xmath31 the average neutralino velocity ( eq .",
    "[ eq : theo ] ) . + a large number of models are giving a rate higher than the estimated false event rate induced by neutrons ( @xmath49 ) , or above the estimated muon background ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it could thus be concluded that a high granularity  detector would present a sensitivity to a large part of the susy region .    in the following ,",
    "the @xmath18 background level ( @xmath51 ) is considered to be the lowest reachable limit for mache3 and it is thus taken as the reference value . any model giving a rate greater than this value is considered hereafter to be _",
    "visible_. this will be used for the comparison with other dm search strategies .",
    "we present a study of the discovery potential of various detection strategies that may be correlated with mache3 .",
    "it is indeed worth understanding whether planned projects would be sensitive to different susy regions . in each case",
    ", we will take into account background estimations , or projected limits , in order to investigate the different discovery potentials .",
    "choosing conservative values will allow to study the phenomenology of various searches without bias .",
    "it should be noticed that the results are model - dependent , both susy and galactic halo ones .",
    "however , standard galactic parameters have been considered and the large susy scan allows for an exhaustive study within phenomenological mssm model .",
    "firstly , we studied the possible correlation between the two types of direct detection : axial and scalar . in the latter case , many detectors are already running , or planned to start measurements in the near future . at first sight , these two direct searches should be largely independent as they involve different processes , in particular the feynman diagrams at the tree level are different . + within the framework of the study described above , the proton scalar cross - section has been evaluated at the tree level .",
    "figure  [ fig : damamac3 ] presents the scalar cross - section on proton as a function of the @xmath0  mass , for all models of the scan not excluded by collider experiments and associated with a relic density within the range of interest ( eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that many susy models lie below the projected limits of future scalar detectors ( cdms @xcite , cresst @xcite ) , while giving an event rate above the value taken as the lowest reachable limit for mache3 .    as an illustration of this complementarity , we present on fig .",
    "[ fig : compdamamac3 ] the regions potentially covered by direct scalar search and by mache3 , in a given part of the susy parameter space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : compdamamac3 ] for details ) .",
    "the reference limits have be chosen as : the cdms projected limit @xcite in one case and the @xmath52 limit for mache3 , previously discussed .",
    "+ it can be noticed that only axial direct search may be sensitive to the @xmath53 region , in this given part of the susy parameter space , due to the fact that scalar interaction vanishes .",
    "the cancellation arises in the @xmath54 channel ( higgs exchange ) which is dominant , with u and d quark contributions of opposite sign and absolute values of the same order  @xcite .",
    "similar cancellation does arise for different value of @xmath20 , in the case of axial interaction .",
    "it can be concluded that these two detection strategies are sensitive , as expected , to different susy regions , thus highlighting their complementarity .      amongst various kind of indirect searches",
    "( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath6 , @xmath58 ) , the detection expected in neutrino telescopes is the only one likely to be correlated with direct detection , as it involves both elastic scattering and annihilation .",
    "the neutralino capture may occur either in the sun or in the earth , through successive elastic scatterings .",
    "as far as comparison with direct detection is concerned , the key point is that the composition of the sun and the earth are different . while the earth is mainly made of even - even nuclei ( o , si , mg , fe )",
    ", the sun is mainly made of h and he .",
    "so one expects the signal coming from annihilation in the centre of the earth to be only correlated with the signal expected from scalar direct detection .",
    "on the contrary , the sun being made of both even and odd nuclei , a very light correlation is expected with direct detection , both scalar and axial .",
    "+ within the framework of the study described above , we tried to find out whether the mache3 project would present a complementarity with the project of @xmath58 telescopes , such as icecube @xcite or antares @xcite .",
    "these projects aimed at building a very large detector , of size of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "the instrumentation will thus be loose , giving a rather high detection threshold .",
    "we follow @xcite in choosing a reference threshold of @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig : neutrinosvsmache3 ] shows the result of the calculation for @xmath58 telescopes and mache3 . the expected @xmath18 flux ( @xmath61 ) is shown against the rate in mache3 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the background usually taken as ultimate for @xmath58 telescopes , coming from the interaction of cosmic rays in the sun s corona @xcite , is indicated at a level of @xmath63 .",
    "we consider this value as the most favourable limit for these projects of @xmath64 detectors . in the same way",
    ", the background noise from @xmath18 in mache3 is taken as the lowest reachable level , as discussed above ( sec .",
    "[ sec : xsrate ] ) . any model above these limits",
    "are said hereafter to be _ visible _ for this type of detection .",
    "it can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinosvsmache3 ] that there is a complementarity between indirect @xmath58 detection and axial direct detection , and in particular in the case of the mache3 detector .",
    "many models may be _ visible _ in only one kind of detection strategy , high mass neutralinos being seen , for instance , only in @xmath58 telescopes .",
    "+ as for the comparison between scalar and axial detection , we present on fig .  [",
    "fig : compantaresmac3 ] the susy regions potentially observable for these two types of detection strategies . as expected ,",
    "neutrino telescopes are sensitive to higher values of @xmath65 . for this given region of the susy parameter space , it can be concluded that the combination of these two signals may close the gap between collider excluded region and cosmological bounded regions , up to high @xmath65 values .",
    "it has been shown that a @xmath66 high granularity  detector ( mache3 ) would allow to obtain , in many susy models , a @xmath0  event rate higher than the estimated ( neutrons and muons ) background .",
    "mache3 would thus potentially allow to reach a large part of the susy region , not excluded by current collider limits and for which the neutralino relic density lies within the range of interest .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that this project of new detector would be sensitive to susy regions not covered by future or ongoing dm search detectors , both for direct and indirect detection , thus highlighting the complementarity of mache3 with existing or planned devices .",
