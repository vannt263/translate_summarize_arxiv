    "<S> the homogeneity of matter distribution at large scales is a central _ assumption _ in the standard cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> the case is testable though , thus no longer needs to be a principle , and indeed there have been claims that the distribution of galaxies is homogeneous at radius scales larger than @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> we perform a test for homogeneity using the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample by counting galaxies within a specified volume with the radius scale varying up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis differs from the previous ones in that we directly confront the large - scale structure data with the definition of spatial homogeneity by comparing the _ fluctuations _ of individual number counts with allowed ranges of the _ random _ distribution with homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> the lrg sample shows much larger fluctuations of number counts than the random catalogs up to @xmath1 scale , and even the average is located far outside the range allowed in the random distribution , which implies that the cosmological principle does not hold even at such large scales . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis of mock galaxies derived from the @xmath2-body simulation , however , suggests that the lrg sample is consistent with the current paradigm of cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the cosmological principle is not in the observed sky and nor is demanded to be there by the standard cosmological world model . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals the nature of the cosmological principle adopted in the modern cosmology paradigm , and opens new field of research in theoretical cosmology .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> the modern physical cosmology is built on a simple geometrical _ assumption _ about distribution of matter in the large - scale @xcite . the cosmological principle ( cp ) of modern cosmology states that spatial distribution of matter is homogeneous and isotropic in the large - scale . </S>",
    "<S> being a statement on physical state of matter , it is testable using the observed redshift and the angular location in the sky of luminous galaxies ; the distance is not directly available and in cosmology we have to consider that different distances correspond to different temporal epochs in the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the physical state of distribution of course can not be exactly homogeneous and isotropic which is merely a mathematical idealization . in practice </S>",
    "<S> however one can _ test _ the assumption by comparing the distribution with the random one . as we know that the small scale distributions of celestial objects are apparently far from homogeneous or isotropic </S>",
    "<S> , we can anticipate that if the cp is true there might appear a homogeneity - scale ( hs ) above which the distribution is statistically indistinguishable from the random one . </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this _ </S>",
    "<S> letter _ is to find out the hs from observation .    </S>",
    "<S> such studies based on galaxy count are available in the literature and there are several claims about the hs reached at scales of @xmath3@xmath4 @xcite ( see @xcite for somewhat larger hs ) ; @xmath5 is the hubble parameter normalized to @xmath6 ; for contrary views , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , most of the methods used to reach the conclusion are not about direct test one can navely think of , i.e , comparing the fluctuations in the galaxy counts with the one in the _ random _ realization . </S>",
    "<S> our result based on such a method shows that even far beyond the claimed hs the observed distribution is _ not _ homogeneous even at @xmath1 scales ! </S>",
    "<S> this is true not only for fluctuations but also for average as well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our conclusion is that the observation we have used does _ not _ show any hs .    </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion does not necessarily imply that the current cosmological paradigm is challenged . </S>",
    "<S> although the modern cosmology is fundamentally based on the cp , it is a _ theoretical _ assumption on a _ fictitious _ background . in a realistic case the background model </S>",
    "<S> should be added by small - amplitude ( about @xmath7 dimensionless level in the early epoch ) perturbations in all scales , and the background can be achieved by spatial averaging . due to the gravitational instability the fluctuations are amplified in time especially from the small scales . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as the consequent theoretically predicted fluctuations are consistent with the observation the cosmological paradigm based on cp in the background universe ( in the early era ) is safe independently of the strong statement on the actual existence of cp in the observed sky ; without the hs the cp in that space ( even in a background ) lose its meaning .    </S>",
    "<S> although the issue on whether or not the colossal structures discovered in the large - scale , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) great wall boasting @xmath1 in linear dimension , is consistent with the cosmological simulation is currently under debate @xcite , our additional test in this work , now comparing observation with the simulation , reveals that the observed fluctuations are _ consistent _ with the simulated ones at radius scales up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may conclude that although we do not have the hs in the observed galaxy distribution , the modern cosmology theoretically based on the cp is consistent with the observed large - scale galaxy distribution .    in this _ </S>",
    "<S> letter _ , we perform a direct test for homogeneity of large - scale structure using the recent galaxy redshift survey data by counting galaxies within a specified volume with varying size scale . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the previous studies based on the _ average trend _ of galaxy counts over different scales , our analysis compares the _ fluctuations _ ( in addition to the average ) of individual number counts with the expected range allowed by the random distribution with homogeneity .    </S>",
    "<S> _ sdss luminous red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> _ we use the sdss data release 7 luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample @xcite to explore the homogeneity of our local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the lrg sample contains galaxies that are believed to be a good tracers of massive halos , and quasi - volume - limited up to redshift @xmath8 , thereafter flux - limited up to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the lrg sample provided in @xcite , which includes 105,831 galaxies over redshift range of @xmath10 with effective volume of @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : lrg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ random catalogs and mock catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> _ in order to decide whether or not the lrg are homogeneously distributed at a given scale , we compare the galaxy counts with those from homogeneous distribution . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we generate 1,000 random catalogs , each containing the poisson - distributed data points with the same number as in the lrg sample , by considering lrg redshift distribution and angular selection function as the probability functions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze these catalogs to set the criterion for the spatial homogeneity .    </S>",
    "<S> we also make the mock catalogs that mimick the lrg sample . using the all - sky lightcone halo catalogs made from @xmath2-body simulation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we generate 1,296 lrg mock data sets , with individual survey area uniformly separated but significantly overlapped on the sky . within the survey area , </S>",
    "<S> massive halos with the same number of lrg have been extracted in decreasing order of halo mass by considering the lrg redshift distribution and angular selection function ( see methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze these mock data sets to check whether or not the observation is consistent with the current paradigm of cosmology .    _ counting galaxies within a sphere . _ to test for homogeneity of large - scale structure , first we apply the count - in - sphere method in the similar way as in @xcite . as a measure of homogeneity , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the scaled count - in - sphere @xmath12 defined as the number of galaxies within a sphere of comoving radius @xmath13 centered at each galaxy divided by the number expected in the homogeneous distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is estimated from a random point distribution which contains 100 times larger number of data points than the single data set . for each @xmath12 , we assign a weight which is a fraction of the volume of a sphere within the survey relative to that of a complete sphere ( volume - incompleteness ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : count]*a**d * show the weighted average of the scaled counts for comoving radius up to @xmath1 and histograms of individual @xmath14 s for three chosen radii . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged @xmath14 goes over into unity with a flat slope at scales larger than around @xmath0 , approaching to @xmath15 within 1% at @xmath16 , which is very similar to the results shown in @xcite and used to imply the existence of claimed hs . </S>",
    "<S> however , individual scaled counts show significant fluctuations deviating from the average . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter decreases as the radius increases with standard deviations of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath21 ) for the lrg ( one random ) catalog at @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lrg sample has 5 times larger fluctuations even at @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that _ fluctuations _ are more important measure of the homogeneity than the approaching of _ average _ numbers to the homogeneous ones ; the latter is only one of the necessary conditions for homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> later we will show that even the average of the lrg ( while consistent with mock data ) show statistically significant deviation from the random one .    _ counting galaxies within redshift ranges . </S>",
    "<S> _ the count - in - sphere method needs the random point distribution to correct for the bias due to the survey incompleteness in radial ( thus time ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> here we apply a count - in - redshift - range method which avoids such a bias without the need to use the random distribution . in order to save computation time we consider a truncated cone instead of a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we select lrg within a slice of @xmath24 thickness at the central redshift @xmath25 . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> three slices are chosen with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lrg]*a * ) . </S>",
    "<S> for each galaxy within the thin slice , we place a sphere of radius @xmath13 at @xmath25 but with the galaxy s angular position , and define a truncated cone that is circumscribed about the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the upper and base sides of the truncated cone set the minimum and maximum redshifts ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) which determine the slice of @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) thickness . </S>",
    "<S> then , we count galaxies within the truncated cone and calculate a new measure of homogeneity @xmath33 defined as the number density of galaxies within a truncated cone divided by that within the whole slice . for a homogeneous distribution , we expect @xmath33 to approach unity compared with the random distribution at scales larger than hs . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath33 is assigned a weight that is the volume - incompleteness of a truncated cone . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : count]*e**h * show the weighted average of @xmath33 s versus @xmath13 for @xmath34 slice galaxies , together with histograms of individual @xmath33 s for three chosen radii .    as in the case of count - in - sphere </S>",
    "<S> , the lrg histograms from the count - in - redshift - range analysis confirm that the averaged @xmath33 seems to approach homogeneity with 1% accuracy at @xmath1 scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , individual @xmath33 s show significant fluctuations far deviating from the range allowed by the random catalogs with homogeneous distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable behaviors of fluctuations for lrg and mock data at @xmath1 scale also suggest that the homogeneity has not been reached yet at such a scale ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : count]*h * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is visually demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xi - maps ] where @xmath33 has been estimated on pixelized positions within the survey area for the lrg , one random , two mock catalogs with the maximum and minimum fluctuations in @xmath33 measurements .    _ discussion . _ in this _ letter _ , we directly confront the large - scale structure data with the definition of spatial homogeneity by considering that beyond the hs there would be no variation in the galaxy counts within the scatter expected in the poisson distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the two galaxy - counting methods we adopted have a limitation that @xmath14 ( or @xmath33 ) goes over into unity on the survey - sized scale regardless of whether or not homogeneity has been reached @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a distribution with hs smaller than the survey size the @xmath14 and @xmath33 should approach unity at all scales beyond hs within the precision allowed by the random catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses demonstrate that the lrg distribution does _ not _ show homogeneity at the claimed hs that was usually determined based on the average trend of galaxy number count with increasing scale @xcite .    to quantify the significance of the deviation from homogeneity , we compare the average @xmath35 and standard deviation @xmath36 estimated from the @xmath33-distribution for the lrg , random , and mock catalogs . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xi_mean_std ] , the lrg sample and most of mock catalogs significantly deviate from the range allowed by the random distribution with spatial homogeneity at @xmath3@xmath1 scales ( * a**b * , * e**f * ) and the behavior persists over different redshifts ( * b**d * , * f**h * ) for both fluctuations and averages . at @xmath34 and @xmath16 ( </S>",

    "<S> the mock catalogs also show larger fluctuations in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 than the random ones , which is another evidence for the fact that the @xmath2-body clustering is no longer homogeneous even at @xmath1 scales . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : xi_mean_std]*f * ) . considering the dense overlaps of survey areas of mock catalogs </S>",
    "<S> , however , we can expect that the scatters in @xmath33 statistics become larger for independent mock samples . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the lrg deviations are allowed to occur statistically . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : xi_mean_std]*b**d * shows that in the @xmath35@xmath36 plane the three independent lrg data can occur in arbitrary location of the region occupied by the mock data ; the similar locations of the lrg data for @xmath16 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xi_mean_std]*f**h * are due to severe overlapping of the lrg data in the redshift direction for such a huge radius . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the lrg distribution is consistent with the current paradigm of cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ the large - scale structure shown in the sdss lrg sample is not spatially homogeneous even at @xmath1 scale in radius , substantially deviating from the expected distribution with homogeneity , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xi_mean_std ] . for lrg data </S>",
    "<S> there is no hs found yet . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the claimed hs at @xmath0 based on similar data @xcite is disputed . to determine the value of hs ( if it exists ) </S>",
    "<S> , it is essential to analyze data with larger survey volume ; @xmath1 is near maximal radius scale available in the lrg data especially in the redshift direction . </S>",
    "<S> we defer the analysis with more recent data ( e.g. , sdss - iii boss survey @xcite ) for future work .    if the cp is not in the sky , where is it then in the universe ? </S>",
    "<S> the current concordance cosmology theoretically based on the cp in the _ early _ era is generally accepted to be quite successful in explaining most of the cosmological observations . </S>",
    "<S> our homogeneity test shows that the model prediction is also consistent with the observation . if that is the case the cp may stay in the theoretical foundation of the modern physical cosmology ( in the early era ) , but not in the sky ( i.e. , in the present epoch ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the celebrated modern cosmology paradigm does not demand the actual presence of cp in our observed sky . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion opens a new possibility in theoretical cosmology demanding careful study of light propagation in nonlinear clustering stage of the world model @xcite .    </S>",
