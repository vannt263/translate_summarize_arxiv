    "while considerable progress has been made , these models remain in the modal picture .",
    "knowledge of mode properties is required to characterize the noise , making it difficult to study complex systems in which the mode information is unknown _ a priori_. without invoking the modal picture , hofmann and hess obtained the quantum maxwell - bloch equations including spatiotemporal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "although it was useful to study spatial and temporal coherence in diode lasers , this formalism was based on the assumption that the temporal fluctuations of carrier density and photon density were statistically independent , which often broke down above the lasing threshold .",
    "a fdtd simulation of microcavity lasers including quantum fluctuations was also done recently @xcite .",
    "this simplified model added white gaussian noise as a source to the electric field . the noise amplitude depended only on the excited state s lifetime .",
    "the dephasing process , which was much faster than the excited state s population decay , should have induced more noise but was neglected .",
    "our goal is to develop a fdtd - based numerical method to simulate fluctuations in macroscopic systems caused by interactions of atoms and photons with reservoirs ( heatbaths ) .",
    "such interactions induce temporal decay of photon number , atomic polarization and excited state s population , which can be described phenomenologically by decay constants .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem demands temporal fluctuations or noise to accompany these decays .",
    "we intend to incorporate such noise in a way compatible with the fdtd method , that allows one to study the light - matter interaction in complex systems without prior knowledge of modes . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we included noise caused by the interaction of light field with external reservoir in an open system . in this paper",
    ", we develop a numerical model to simulate noise caused by the interaction of atoms with reservoirs such as lattice vibrations and atomic collisions . as an example",
    ", we apply the method to a numerical simulation of superfluorescence in a macroscopic system where the dominant noise is from the atoms rather than the light field .",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath5 can be considered independent of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "hence , they do not have a dependence on spatial location nor frequency .",
    "we also include incoherent pumping of atoms from level 1 to level 2 .",

    "starting from the quantum langevin equation within the markovian approximation , drummond and raymer derived a set of stochastic _",

    "the noise sources in these equations are from both the damping and the nonlinearity in the hamiltonian .",
    "the latter represents the nonclassical component of noise , giving rise to nonclassical statistical behavior .",
    "since our primary interests lie with classical behavior of macroscopic systems , such as superfluorescence and lasing , we neglect the nonclassical noise in this paper .",
    "the amplitude of classical noise accompanying the field decay is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thermal photon number . at room temperature",
    "the number of thermal photons at visible frequencies ( @xmath19 1 ev ) is on the order of @xmath20 .",
    "this can be interpreted in a quantum mechanical picture as that most of the time there are no thermal photons at visible frequencies in the system .",
    "thus , the noise related to field decay is neglected in this paper . at higher temperatures or longer wavelengths ,",
    "this noise becomes significant and it can be incorporated into the fdtd algorithm following the approach we developed in our previous work @xcite .    the classical noise related to the pumping and decay of the atomic density matrix can be expressed as @xmath21 these noise terms are associated with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 respectively .",

    "we forcibly keep @xmath39 constant via the relation @xmath40 and only calculate the excited state s population @xmath41 .",
    "the final stochastic equations to be solved are @xmath42 in the above equation , the steady - state value of @xmath9 in ( [ eq : blochvectordot ] ) is substituted by @xmath43 , an expression obtained by setting the time derivatives in ( [ eq : blochvectordot ] ) to zero .",
    "@xmath44 in the expression of @xmath31 in ( [ eq : gamma122122 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "the most commonly used method of solving the maxwell - bloch equations is the `` strongly coupled method . '' with @xmath46 being the time step , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are both computed at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , _ etc . _ , while @xmath51 is computed at @xmath52 , @xmath53 , _ etc .",

    "the electric field @xmath3 is computed at times @xmath49 , @xmath50 , but @xmath48 is calculated at @xmath52 , @xmath53 , thereby decoupling those discretized equations and creating a simple leap - frog type propagation system for 1d .",
    "the noise terms in ( [ eq : theory ] ) are present throughout the entirety of the simulation and thus , should be incorporated efficiently .",
    "after discretization , the @xmath55 terms are correlated according to @xmath56 , and can be generated quickly with the marsaglia and bray modification of the box - mller transformation @xcite . because the noise terms contain @xmath57 , as seen in ( [ eq : gamma122122 ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma1222 ] ) , we are not able to use the weakly coupled scheme to solve for @xmath58 and @xmath24 as precisely as possible . instead",

    "we apply the maxwell - bloch equations with noise to a fdtd simulation of superfluorescence ( sf ) and compare the results to previous data obtained experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "sf is the cooperative radiation of an initially inverted but incoherent two - level medium resulting from spontaneous buildup of a macroscopic coherent dipole .",
    "this is an interesting and suitable case to study with our method because both spatial propagation of light and noise are important .",

    "the em modes propagating non - parallel to the cylinder axis are not supported @xcite . those modes propagating along the cylinder axis",
    "do not have a strong radial dependence , nor are there significant diffraction losses .",

    "the grid resolution is @xmath78 nm and the total running time is @xmath79 ns . the courant number @xmath80 is set to 0.999999 . the magic time step , @xmath81 , was seen to cause an instability in some cases .",
    "the value @xmath82 , however , does not propagate the large sudden impulses of the noise accurately .",
    "setting @xmath83 preserves the accuracy to an acceptable degree while eliminating the instability at @xmath81 .",
    "there is some numerical dispersion and reflection from the absorbing boundary layer , but the error is of the order @xmath84 . ignoring non - radiative recombination , the atomic dipole coupling term @xmath85 c@xmath86 m .",
    "the simulation is started with the initial condition of all the atoms being excited ( @xmath87 ) . however , because the atomic population and polarization operators do not commute , the uncertainty principle demands a nonvanishing variance in the initial values of the bloch vector @xcite .",
    "this results in a tipping angle @xmath88 of the initial bloch vector away from the top of bloch sphere ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is given by a gaussian random variable centered at zero with a standard deviation @xmath90 . since there is no incoherent pumping at @xmath91 , @xmath92",

    "the number of atoms that emit cooperatively is estimated to be @xmath95 and is known as the arecchi - courtens cooperation number . since @xmath96 , the sf oscillates in time , with the maximal emission intensity at @xmath97 ps .",

    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . as @xmath5 decreases more , the pulse continues to broaden but the time delay begins to decrease . when @xmath5 reaches the critical value @xmath99 = 15.9 ps , the amount of dephasing is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of cooperative emission .",
