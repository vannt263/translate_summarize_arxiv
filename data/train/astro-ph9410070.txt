    "the quasi - steady - state cosmology ( qssc ) of hoyle , burbidge & narlikar ( 1994 , hereafter hbn ) is based on a spatially flat universe with a scale factor having an exponential growth multiplying a sinusoidal oscillation .",
    "since the observed expansion of the universe is primarily due to the oscillation , this qssc model provides 200 gyr in which to produce the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , instead of the @xmath0  gyr allowed in the steady - state cosmology .",
    "in addition , the large volume of the universe during its oscillatory maxima provides a mechanism for steeper than euclidean source counts . in this paper",
    "i show that it is still difficult , if not impossible , to produce the cmb in the qssc model proposed by hbn ; and that producing the cmb is incompatible with hbn s model for the faint blue galaxies .",
    "the large millimeter wave optical depth required to blacken the cmb makes the millimeter wave luminosity of the qso br  1202 - 0725 the highest known luminosity .",
    "i further show that steeper than euclidean source counts are always accompanied by a redshift distribution that is dominated by blueshifts .",
    "in the qssc model , the cmb is produced by dust absorbing the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , and re - emitting the energy in the millimeter region .",
    "the large millimeter opacity required is produced by iron whiskers .",
    "there is a relation between the ratio of ebl to cmb energy densities and the visible optical depth through an oscillatory minimum . in this section",
    "i will consider a simple model , with a single frequency bin for the `` optical '' light that heats the dust which makes the cmb , and a second frequency bin for the cmb .",
    "if i assume a grey opacity in the optical , then the `` optical '' energy density @xmath1 satisfies the equation d[a^4",
    "u_ebl]/dt = 4a^4 j - c a^4 u_ebl where @xmath2 is the luminosity density , @xmath3 is the optical depth per unit length , and @xmath4 is the scale factor of the universe . in the qssc model @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3",
    "are periodic functions of time with period @xmath7 .",
    "the scale factor follows a(t ) ( 1+(2t / q ) ) ( t / p ) = a(t ) ( t / p ) where hbn gives values @xmath8 , @xmath9  gyr , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "i will now assume that the luminosity density and dust density follow @xmath12 and @xmath13 with these assumptions it is easy to find periodic solutions for @xmath14 .",
    "define f(t ) = ( -_1 c a^-3(t ) dt ) and then u_ebl = a^-4 f(t ) ( c_1 f^-1(t^ ) a(t^)(4t^/p ) dt^+ c_0 ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath15 to @xmath16 can be adjusted to give a periodic solution .    the `` cmb '' energy density @xmath17 satisfies the equation d[a^4",
    "u_cmb]/dt = + c a^4 u_ebl where @xmath3 is again the visual opacity . here",
    "i assume that any cmb radiation absorbed by dust is reradiated as cmb radiation , and the net effect on the energy density cancels out .",
    "the solution to this equation is u_cmb = a^-4 ( _ 1 c a(t^)(4t^/p ) u_ebl dt^+ u_0 ) and i choose the constant of integration @xmath18 to make @xmath17 a periodic function .",
    "the ratio of the optical light now ( at @xmath11 ) to the cmb now is shown as a function of the total visible optical depth through an oscillation in figure [ ratvtau ] .",
    "even for @xmath19 the required optical power remains higher than the observed limits on the ebl .",
    "an ebl brightness of 1 @xmath20 in the visible gives @xmath21 , while the qssc requires @xmath22 even for @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the equilibrium temperature of the dust , and @xmath27 is the millimeter wave optical depth through the oscillatory cycle . but dust observed at a redshift @xmath28 has an apparent temperature of @xmath29 , which is @xmath30 .",
    "this quantity is plotted versus @xmath31 for several values of @xmath32 while letting @xmath33 in figure [ tvst ] . for larger values of @xmath32",
    "the 5% jump in @xmath34 slightly before the oscillatory minimum instead of at the minimum .",
    "this slightly reduces the millimeter optical depth required to adequately blacken the cmb .    for a grey opacity in the millimeter range , it is easy to show that the required opacity is @xmath35 between now and the first 5% temperature step .",
    "the spectrum is approximately a superposition of blackbodies : @xmath36 with weight @xmath37 and @xmath38 with weight @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting @xmath40 .",
    "but since @xmath41 according to mather _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , one needs @xmath42 , or @xmath43 to the oscillatory minimum .",
    "numerical integration of @xmath44 for a grey millimeter opacity shows that @xmath45 gives a sufficiently small @xmath46 if @xmath32 is small , but @xmath47 suffices if @xmath19 . the opacity curve given in hbn s figure 5 is far from grey , but this calculation agrees well with the hbn estimate of @xmath48 through the minimum for adequate blackening of the cmb .",
    "the observations of mcmahon _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) essentially rule out the published version of the qssc , since they have observed millimetric fluxes from quasars with @xmath49 . as discussed above",
    ", the qssc requires that the millimeter transmission between @xmath50 and the oscillatory minimum be very close to zero , and these high redshift quasars are at or beyond the oscillatory minimum .",
    "the ratio of the optical depth to @xmath51 for an observed wavelength of 1.25 mm to the 1.4  ghz optical depth through a full oscillation is 63 .",
    "this calculation is based on the opacity  @xmath52 from figure 5 of hbn . since the 1.4  ghz optical depth should be @xmath53 to give enough cmb flux at 1.4  ghz , the quasars observed by mcmahon _",
    "_ must have gone through @xmath54 .",
    "thus the qssc requires that these sources be @xmath55 times more luminous in millimeter waves than one would normally assume .",
    "this raises @xmath56 for br  1202 - 0725 to @xmath57 .",
    "if 3c273 had this @xmath56 in the v band its magnitude would be @xmath58 .",
    "i have computed source counts using the formulae given by hbn , which are the standard equations of relativistic cosmology once the non - standard quasi - periodic @xmath59 is assumed .",
    "hbn have assumed that radio sources are uniformly distributed in _ physical _ volume , rather than the usual assumption of a constant comoving density .",
    "this assumption maximizes the steepness of the source counts , which is needed to fit the observed data , but it also increases the blueshifted fraction .",
    "the relevant equations are : ( 1+z ) = a(t_)/a(t ) and the comoving radius of our past light cone is r = _ t^t _ ( 1+z ) c dt .",
    "the angular size distance is @xmath60 while the luminosity distance is @xmath61 .",
    "a source with luminosity @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the observed frequency now , has a flux f ( _ ) = .",
    "the source counts are given by n(f ) = _ -^t _ ( 4r_l^2 ( 1+z)^-1 e^f ) 4r_l^2 ( 1+z)^-1 e^ r_a^2 c dt [ count ] where @xmath64 is the source count per steradian in the flux range @xmath65 $ ] , the luminosity function @xmath66 is the number density of sources with luminosities in the range @xmath67 $ ] , and the blueshifted source counts are n_b(f ) = _ -^t _ p_b(z ) ( 4r_l^2 ( 1+z)^-1 e^f ) 4r_l^2 ( 1+z)^-1 e^ r_a^2 c dt [ blue ] where @xmath68 if @xmath69 and zero otherwise .",
    "figure [ hoylerf3 ] shows the normalized cumulative source counts @xmath70 and the blueshifted fraction @xmath71 for the luminosity function used by hbn : a one decade wide function going as @xmath72 .",
    "while hbn did not specify a radio spectral index , this figure has been computed for sources with a @xmath73 spectrum .",
    "the solid curves were computed with @xmath74 , while the dashed curves in this figure show the effect of radio absorption when the optical depth at 1.4  ghz is @xmath75 through the first oscillatory minimum .",
    "note that the blueshifted fraction jumps to more than 90% for the brightest sources that show a steeper than euclidean source count .",
    "thus the 3cr sample , which has source counts that are significantly steeper than euclidean , should be dominated by blueshifts if the qssc were correct .",
    "while it is possible to have no blueshifts in the 3cr flux range by a suitable choice of the luminosity function , one then predicts source counts that are substantially less steep than euclidean , producing a @xmath76 discrepancy in source count slopes between the model and the data ( jauncey , 1975 ) . at the peak of @xmath77 ,",
    "the blueshifted fraction predicted by the qssc is @xmath78 .",
    "the 1 jy sample of allington - smith  ( 1988 ) is at the peak of @xmath77 , has a secure redshift completeness @xmath79 ( rawlings , private communication ) , and no blueshifts .",
    "since one can not fit a @xmath78 blueshifted fraction into a @xmath80 unidentified fraction , the qssc prediction is false .    another way of looking at this problem is shown in figure [ zfnvt ] .",
    "in this plot the integrated physical volume is shown as @xmath81 , with n = _ t^t _ r_a^2 c dt . the blueshifted region is labeled @xmath82 . the flux range",
    "in which blueshifted sources occur in the first oscillatory maximum occur is shown by the lower two horizontal line segments , which carry this flux range over to `` normal '' branch in the current half - cycle . in the region labeled @xmath83 the redshifted sources have the same fluxes as the blueshifted sources .",
    "the range of redshifts during this interval is @xmath84 . but the observed physical volume in the interval @xmath83 is 6000 times smaller than the volume in the interval @xmath82 .",
    "thus for every source in the interval @xmath83 there should be 6000 blueshifted sources .",
    "the flux intervals are identical , so this multitude of blueshifted sources should definitely be present in radio surveys .",
    "the 1 jy sample has at least 1 source in the interval @xmath83 , a radio galaxy with redshift 3.4 ( lilly 1988 ) , so it should contain 6000 blueshifted sources if the qssc were correct .",
    "it is also possible that this galaxy is just past the oscillatory minimum , in the region @xmath85 . but",
    "this possibility only decreases the volume ratio to 1500 , while adding a factor of @xmath86 flux ratio .",
    "thus , if the galaxy were due to a source in @xmath85 , then one would expect 1500 blueshifted sources in a sample of sources brighter than 5 jy at 408 mhz within the 1 jy sample area of 0.11  sr .",
    "but this flux level corresponds to 9 jy at 178 mhz for @xmath87 , so all of these sources would be in the 3c catalog .",
    "but spinrad  ( 1985 ) have redshifts for 214 out of the 235 3cr sources with @xmath88 , a solid angle of @xmath89 sr , so this option requires that 50,000 of the 21 3cr sources without measured redshifts would have to be blueshifted . of course",
    ", the radio galaxy could be even more distant , in the region marked @xmath90 .",
    "but the blueshifted volume in @xmath82 is 250 times larger than the volume in @xmath90 and the flux ratio is @xmath91 , so this explanation of the radio galaxy requires 250 blueshifted sources brighter than 19 jy at 408 mhz in 0.11  sr , or 25,000 such sources over the whole high galactic latitude sky .",
    "finally , the region @xmath92 has a volume that is 135 times smaller than the blueshifted volume in @xmath82 , and a flux ratio @xmath93 .",
    "this possibility requires 13,500 blueshifted sources brighter than 34 jy over the whole sky .",
    "thus for each possibility the qssc requires that there be many times more blueshifted sources than the total number of observed sources .",
    "i note that the hewitt & burbidge qso catalog ( 1993 ) contains roughly 130 qsos with @xmath84 but no blueshifts .",
    "it is this sudden addition of the sources from the last oscillatory maximum that creates the steep source counts in the qssc model , but the brightest of these sources , and hence the easiest to see , are blueshifted .",
    "the qssc can not have both steep source counts and no blueshifts simultaneously , but the observed universe does .",
    "hence the qssc is not a successful model for the universe .",
    "the qssc is disproved by the same data that disproved the steady state : counts of bright radio sources .",
    "this failure of the qssc model , and the cmb power problem , were fully explained to both hbn and to the editor of mnras in a referee s report dated july 1993 , which included a more extensive version of figure [ hoylerf3 ] , but hbn proceeded to publish incorrect results .",
    "the saddest part of this tale is that the qssc can be compatible with the radio source counts , the qso @xmath94 test , and the cmb ; by making @xmath95 larger and @xmath96 large which eliminates the blueshifts . to get the steep source counts",
    "one adds a new factor @xmath97^n$ ] inside the integrals in equations [ count ] and [ blue ] .",
    "this introduces density evolution into the qssc , but in a periodic way . while the philosophy of the steady state model did not allow evolution of the radio source population",
    ", the qssc model certainly allows a periodic evolution of the source population .",
    "in fact , one might expect a high density of radio sources at the oscillatory minima .",
    "the only problem with this approach is that it eliminates the observational differences between the qssc and the big bang , and there is nothing left to motivate the introduction of new physics . but",
    "eliminating these differences is necessary , since the big bang can fit the data , while hbn s qssc model does not ."
