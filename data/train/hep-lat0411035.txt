    "the qcd lagrangian @xmath13 is parity invariant . on the other hand",
    "the possible spontaneous breaking of parity is experimentally ruled out to a high precision .",
    "there is a debate as to whether the absence of spontaneous breaking can be analytically proved in qcd . by studying the euclidean formulation of the theory , vafa and",
    "witten  @xcite argued that such breaking is not possible .",
    "their argument is the following : spontaneous breaking of parity occurs when there exists some parity violating operator @xmath14 whose vacuum expectation value remains nonvanishing after sending @xmath15 in the extended theory @xmath16 .",
    "however in the euclidean formulation of the theory , any parity ",
    "odd operator must pick up an imaginary @xmath17 factor ( ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath18 term contributes a phase to the euclidean partition function and hence the free energy has its minimum at @xmath1 and @xmath19 vanishes .    as pointed out by several authors",
    "@xcite the above argument is insufficient to exclude the scenario of spontaneous parity breaking .",
    "it is necessary to prove as well that the free energy and its derivatives at its minimum are continuous functions of @xmath0 .    if the parity violating probe is the topological charge density @xmath20 , then it is possible to show  @xcite that the partition function @xmath21 is finite throughout the whole complex plane of @xmath0 and arguments can be given against the appearance of dangerous lee  yang zeros  @xcite .",
    "we want to study on the lattice the question about the continuity of the derivatives of the free energy for the case of the parity  odd ( and time inversion  odd ) operator @xmath20 and give an upper bound to the order parameter @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total topological charge .",
    "we assume that the free energy @xmath24 of the pure gauge theory at its minimum ( at @xmath1 , after vafa and witten theorem ) has a discontinuous derivative .",
    "if we call d@xmath25d@xmath26 then the vacuum expectation value @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spacetime volume and @xmath29 is a positive real number which specifies the density of spontaneously generated net topological charge .",
    "the alternating sign indicates the choice of the vacuum . by inserting a complete set of intermediate states @xmath30",
    "( @xmath31 represents pure gluonic states ) between the two topological charge operators in @xmath32 we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath2 is the usual topological susceptibility defined in  @xcite . notice that if @xmath34 then the above expectation value depends linearly on the volume . in the present paper we investigate this volume dependence on the lattice for the pure @xmath3 yang  mills theory in order to set a bound on the value of the slope @xmath29 .",
    "the quenched theory was simulated by using the standard plaquette action  @xcite on the lattice at the inverse bare coupling @xmath35 on three volumes : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in all cases a heat  bath algorithm combined with overrelaxation was used for updating configurations and care was taken ( by checking the autocorrelation function ) to decorrelate successive measurements in order to render them independent .    the total topological charge was measured with the once  smeared operator  @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "the lattice equivalent of eq.([defchi ] ) is @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the dimensionless volume of the lattice , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the lattice spacing .    in figure  1 and table  1",
    "we show the result for @xmath44 for the three volumes .",
    "our investigation requires a precise determination of the topological susceptibility , hence we used huge statistics .",
    "the simulations were performed with the apemille facility in pisa .    in general the lattice topological susceptibility @xmath44",
    "is related to the physical one @xmath2 by a multiplicative and an additive renormalization  @xcite .",
    "the equation that expresses this relationship is    * table 1 * : value of @xmath44 and statistics for each lattice size .",
    "@xmath45 for convenience we call @xmath46 .",
    "we renormalize the topological charge operator @xmath47 by imposing that it takes integer eigenvalues in the continuum limit . to obtain this result",
    "we must introduce a renormalization constant  @xcite which is finite in virtue of the renormalization group invariance of @xmath48 in the quenched theory .",
    "this is the origin of the factor @xmath49 in expression  ( [ chilat ] ) .",
    "the operator expansion of the product @xmath50 contains a contact term  @xcite .",
    "part of this term must be subtracted and this is @xmath51 in expression  ( [ chilat ] ) .",
    "we fix this additive subtraction by imposing that the topological susceptibility must vanish in the absence of instantons  @xcite . by construction @xmath51",
    "is independent of the background topological sector .",
    "these definitions are valid when @xmath52 and apply equally well to the case where @xmath34 .    to extract information about the parameter @xmath29 in eq.([chilat ] ) we have to know @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "we have calculated these renormalization constants paying attention to their possible volume dependence .     versus the lattice size for @xmath35 .",
    "we determined the renormalization constants @xmath49 and @xmath51 by the nonperturbative method introduced in  @xcite .",
    "following the meaning of @xmath49 , we calculate it by computing the average topological charge within a fixed topological sector .",
    "if we choose a topological sector of charge @xmath53 ( any nonzero integer ) then @xmath54 where the division by @xmath53 entails the requirement that @xmath48 takes integer values as described above .",
    "the brackets @xmath55 mean thermalization within the topological sector of charge @xmath53 .",
    "we start our algorithm with a classical configuration with topological charge 1 ( @xmath56 ) and action @xmath57 in appropriate units .",
    "then we apply 80 heat  bath updating steps and measure @xmath47 every 4 steps .",
    "this set of 20 measurements is called `` trajectory '' . after each measurement",
    "we cool the configuration to verify that the topological sector is not changed .",
    "we repeat this procedure to obtain a number of trajectories . for each trajectory",
    "we always discard the first measurements because the configuration is not yet thermalized .",
    "averaging over the thermalized steps ( as long as the corresponding cooled configuration shows the correct background topological charge , @xmath56 within a deviation @xmath58 ) yields @xmath59 .",
    "we estimate the systematic error that stems from the choice of @xmath58 as in  @xcite .",
    "we followed the above procedure on three lattice sizes to study any possible volume dependence of @xmath49 . in table  2 the number of trajectories and volume sizes are displayed .",
    "* table 2 * : number of trajectories utilized in the calculation of @xmath49 and @xmath51 .    in figure",
    "2 we show the results for @xmath49 extrapolated to the form @xmath60 .",
    "they look very stable , mainly at the lattice sizes of our interest ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the errors were calculated including the cross correlation , @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath65 test leads to  0.02 .",
    "versus @xmath66 for the 1smeared topological charge operator @xmath47 at @xmath35 .",
    "the line is the result of the fit ( displayed in the legend ) and the grey band is its 1@xmath67 error . ]    as for the additive renormalization constant @xmath51 the procedure is quite analogous .",
    "this time we calculate @xmath68 .",
    "single trajectories consist again of 80 heat  bath steps with measurements every 4 steps and cooling tests after each measurement .",
    "thermalization ( with short distance fluctuations ) require us to discard the initial steps . in table  2",
    "the number of trajectories for each lattice size is shown .    in figure",
    "3 the results for @xmath51 extrapolated with a fit to the form @xmath69 are shown . the nontrivial dependence on @xmath66 is evident .",
    "hitherto this dependence had not been detected because the statistics ( number of trajectories ) was much lower than in the present paper .     versus @xmath66 for the 1smeared topological charge operator @xmath47 at @xmath35 .",
    "the line is the result of the fit ( displayed in the legend ) and the grey band is its 1@xmath67 error . ]    again the @xmath65 test is rather small : 0.05 .",
    "also a nonzero cross correlation is present , @xmath70 and the grey band of errors in figure  3 was calculated by making use of it .    in table  3",
    "the results extrapolated for @xmath49 and @xmath51 on the lattice sizes used for the calculation of @xmath71 in section  2 are shown .",
    "* table 3 * : extrapolated values for @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to check the results of @xmath51 by calculating it on different background topological sectors .",
    "in fact this renormalization constant can also be calculated as @xmath72 , where @xmath53 can be any integer and @xmath49 is the previously determined renormalization constant .",
    "the results for @xmath51 obtained by using different topological sectors @xmath53 agree within errors  @xcite .",
    "notice that this fact bears out the independence of @xmath51 on the topological charge sector .    in figures  2 and  3",
    "we have included the systematic error that is generated during the cooling test .",
    "this error shows up because if some new instanton had appeared during the updating process along the trajectory then this trajectory must be discarded .",
    "however in some cases the cooling relaxation eliminates this unwanted instanton and in this ( rare ( ) ) event the configuration is wrongly taken as lying in the correct topological sector .",
    "this error tends to modify the values of @xmath51 and @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath32 is calculated on the @xmath73 topological sector , any jump from the @xmath73 sector enlarges the value of @xmath51 . on the other hand in the calculation of @xmath49 on the @xmath56 sector , due to the symmetry of the topological charge distribution around @xmath73",
    ", the configuration prefers to move to the @xmath73 sector and this effect lowers the result for @xmath49 .",
    "therefore this uncertainty turns out to be asymmetric around the central value .    to estimate the influence of this error on the value of @xmath51 we measure also the plaquette .     versus the lattice size for @xmath35 .",
    "the straight line is the result of the fit described in the text and the grey band is its 1@xmath67 statistical error . ]    after several heating steps the plaquette thermalizes and a plateau in its signal appears .",
    "the difference between the value of @xmath74 at the step where this plateau sets in and the value at the last step in the trajectory is taken as an estimate of this error .",
    "an analogous procedure was followed in the calculation of @xmath49 .",
    "this error was added to the one corresponding to the choice of @xmath58 ( see above ) to form the total systematic error of our calculation .",
    "we are planning to study this systematic error more carefully by using the overlap algorithm  @xcite in place of cooling to evaluate the background topological charge @xmath48 .",
    "with the data of table  1 and  3 and eq.([chilat ] ) we obtain the values of @xmath75 that are shown in figure  4 . a fit ( with the @xmath65 estimator ) to the functional form @xmath76 yields @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; the first errors being statistical and the second ones being systematic from cooling .    by using the values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 tabulated in  @xcite and the ratio for @xmath81 from",
    "@xcite we get @xmath82 mev and @xmath83  fermi .",
    "this leads to the 1@xmath67 bound on the parity violating order parameter @xmath84    much as an explicit @xmath0 term in the lagrangian violates both parity and time reversal and allows for a nonzero value of the electric dipole moment @xmath85 of fermions , the spontaneous breaking of parity driven by the topological charge operator brings about a nonvanishing @xmath85 .",
    "this @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath29 times some volume which in the case of the neutron can be estimated as the volume occupied by this particle , roughly @xmath86 .",
    "moreover the whole effect would disappear if the lagrangian was chiral because then the extended theory @xmath87 would be equivalent to @xmath13 with @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath0 would vanish and spontaneous breaking of parity could not occur .",
    "to lowest order , this means that the result for @xmath85 must be proportional to the squared pion mass . barring large numerical factors , using the neutron mass @xmath88 as the typical scale of the problem and assuming that the bound in expression ( [ albound ] ) applies to the full theory too",
    ", we estimate the spontaneously generated electric dipole moment of the neutron as @xmath89 to be compared with the experimental limit , @xmath90  @xcite . the result ( [ dexp ] )",
    "must not be confused with the electric dipole moment calculated for the neutron in the presence of an explicit nonzero physical value of @xmath0  @xcite . in our case",
    "the physical @xmath0 is zero .",
    "we explicitely notice that our bound on the parameter @xmath29 was obtained at fixed @xmath91 ( fixed @xmath43 ) and it is not affected by the continuum limit .",
    "our method also allows to extract the topological susceptibility with great precision . from the value for @xmath92 obtained in the fit",
    "we get @xmath5 where the first error is our statistical , the second is the propagation of the error on @xmath8 and the third one is the systematic from cooling .",
    "the two first errors must be added in quadrature .",
    "this is the value of @xmath2 obtained at @xmath6 .",
    "an extrapolation @xmath93 should be made with comparable precision .",
    "usually the error derived from this extrapolation is negligible as compared with the statistical one .",
    "however our value of the topological susceptibility has been obtained after a very high statistics simulation and this causes the systematic effects to become important .",
    "the result for the topological susceptibility can be compared with @xmath94 obtained in  @xcite from a monte carlo simulation on a @xmath36 lattice .",
    "it can also be compared with the analytical prediction  @xcite @xmath95 obtained within a @xmath96 expansion .",
    "we have studied the consequences of the spontaneous breaking of parity and time inversion symmetries on the topological charge operator in pure yang  mills theory with gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "we assumed that in the infinite volume limit the free energy @xmath24 of the extended theory @xmath16 has a cusp at its minimum , @xmath1 that signals a nonzero value of the topological charge in the vacuum , d@xmath97d@xmath98 .    by calculating the value of the topological susceptibility on the lattice to high precision we have obtained a bound on @xmath29 : within 1@xmath67 error ,",
    "there is no spontaneously generated net topological charge in a volume of ( 4 fermi)@xmath99 .",
    "the bound on @xmath29 becomes an upper bound for the neutron electric dipole moment which however is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude less precise than the corresponding experimental limit .    as a byproduct of our monte carlo simulation",
    ", we have also obtained a precise result for the topological susceptibility , @xmath5 ( the errors are respectively statistical from our monte carlo simulation , statistical from the value used for @xmath8 and systematic from the cooling used during the evaluation of the renormalization constants ) .",
    "the precision in the statistics forced us to study this systematic error which otherwise can be neglected .",
    "the continuum limit should be made with comparable precision .",
    "we have done the calculation by using the so  called `` field theoretical method '' where the renormalization constants relating the lattice and the physical susceptibilities are explicitely computed .",
    "this method proves to be fast and efficient enough to allow to obtain a huge number of measurements on rather large lattices , ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the apemille facility in pisa was used for the runs .",
    "the renormalization constants in  eq.([chilat ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath51 , have been calculated with high statistics at various volumes .",
    "the value of @xmath49 looks rather stable with the volume , while the value of @xmath51 displays a clean volume dependence ( see fig .",
