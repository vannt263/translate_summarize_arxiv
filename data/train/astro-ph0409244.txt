    "neutron stars are created in the aftermath of the gravitational core collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives .",
    "after the supernova explosions , the nascent neutron stars receive the rapid rotations and large magnetic fields , which are believed to be observed as pulsars .",
    "thus , rotations and magnetic fields should be naturally taken into account in order not only to clarify the explosion mechanism , but also to explain the observed properties of neutron stars .",
    "here it is noted that the number of studies including such multidimensional aspects is increasing recently @xcite .",
    "this may reflect the fact that only the neutrino heating mechanism assuming spherical symmetry seems difficult to produce the explosions @xcite .    among the unresolved mysteries in context of core - collapse supernovae",
    ", the physical origin of the pulsar kicks has been long controversial .",
    "recent analyses of individual pulsar motions and observations of remnant associations between supernovae and pulsars indicate that supernovae explosions are asymmetric and that the neutron stars receive large kick velocities at birth ( typically @xmath1 km / s @xcite , with highest values greater than @xmath2 km / s @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of pulsar kicks are also supported by the evolutionary studies of neutron star and black hole binaries @xcite and by the detections of geodetic and orbital plane precessions in some binary pulsars @xcite .",
    "the recent x - ray observations have shown the correlation between the direction of pulsar motions and the spin axis of their supernovae in vela and crab pulsars @xcite .",
    "however it is statistically uncertain whether the spin - kick alignment is a generic feature of all pulsars .",
    "so far two major classes of mechanism for these kicks have been suggested ( see @xcite for a review ) . any models or mechanisms",
    "should explain how the explosions become asymmetric and how the generated asymmetric explosions are related to the formation of the pulsar kicks .",
    "the first class of the mechanisms relies on the asymmetric explosion as a result of the global convective instabilities @xcite caused by the pre - collapse density inhomogeneities @xcite or the local convective instabilities @xcite formed after the onset of core - collapse .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported in their two dimensional simulations that in the long duration explosions ( more than a second after bounce ) , the neutrino - driven convections behind the expanding shock can lead the global asymmetries , which accelerates the remnant neutron star to a several hundreds of km / s ( see , also @xcite for three dimensional calculations ) . in their simulations , the central protoneutron star is fixed as the inner boundary condition .",
    "fully self - consistent calculations are required to confirm whether this assumption is valid or not .",
    "here we pay attention to the second class of models in which the pulsar kicks arise from an asymmetry of neutrinos induced by the strong magnetic field ( @xmath3 g ) in the collapsed supernova core .",
    "while the dipolar magnetic fields of most radio pulsars are observed to lie in the range of @xmath4 g , several recent observations imply that the soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars have the strong magnetic fields as high as @xmath5 g @xcite .",
    "so far , much theoretical efforts have been paid to formulate the neutrino opacity in such a strong magnetic fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that little attention has been paid to investigate how the asymmetric neutrino heatings work globally in the supernova core based on the numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , most of the preceding studies relies on the asymmetry of the neutrinos only by the magnetic fields ( see , however , @xcite for the simple models of atmosphere in the supernova core ) .",
    "it is noted that rotation should also contribute to produce the asymmetry of the neutrino heating @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the degree of the neutrino heating asymmetry under the presence of the rotation and the strong magnetic fields at the same time has not been investigated so far .",
    "this situation leads us to investigate how the rotation - induced anisotropic neutrino heating @xcite are affected by the strong magnetic fields through parity - violating effects . in this study",
    ", we perform a series of two - dimensional simulations of magnetorotational core collapse . in order to see the parity - violating effects , we pay particular attention to the models , which are assumed to have the strong poloidal magnetic fields ( @xmath6 g ) prior to core - collapse .",
    "since the profiles of the angular momentum and the magnetic fields of such strongly magnetized stars are still quite uncertain ( see , however , @xcite ) , we change the strength of the rotation and the magnetic fields systematically . based on the simulations from the onset of the core - collapse through the bounce to the shock - stall , we demonstrate how large the anisotropy of neutrino heating could be globally in the supernova core .",
    "furthermore , we hope to speculate their possible effects on the pulsar kicks .",
    "we describe the numerical methods in section [ s2 ] .",
    "the main numerical results are shown in section [ s3 ] .",
    "discussion are given in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we conclude this paper in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the numerical method for magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) computations employed in this paper is based on the zeus-2d code @xcite .",
    "the zeus-2d is an eulerian code based on the finite - difference method and employs an artificial viscosity of von neumann and richtmyer to capture shocks .",
    "the time evolution of magnetic field is solved by the induction equation : @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being velocity and the magnetic field , respectively . in so doing ,",
    "the code utilizes the so - called constrained transport ( ct ) method , which ensures that the numerically evolved magnetic fields are divergence - free ( @xmath9 ) at all times .",
    "furthermore , the method of characteristics ( moc ) is implemented to propagate accurately all modes of mhd waves .",
    "the self - gravity is managed by solving the poisson equation with the incomplete cholesky decomposition conjugate gradient method . in all the computations ,",
    "spherical coordinates are used and one quadrant of the meridian section is covered with 300 ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 50 ( @xmath12 ) mesh points .",
    "we have made several major changes to the base code to incorporate the microphysics .",
    "first , we added an equation for the electron fraction to treat electron captures and neutrino transport by the so - called leakage scheme @xcite .",
    "the calculation of electron fraction is done separately from the main hydrodynamic step in an operator - splitting manner .",
    "second , we implemented a tabulated equation of state based on the relativistic mean field theory @xcite instead of the ideal gas eos assumed in the original code . for a more detailed description of the methods ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed the most up - to - date stellar evolution calculations including the effects of rotation , mixing , transport of the angular momentum , and the magnetic torques .",
    "their models show that the toroidal magnetic fields are much stronger than the poloidal ones prior to core collapse . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we considered such models as the initial conditions . however , if such initial configurations are true , no parity - violating effects of the magnetic fields on the neutrino heating can be obtained in the two - dimensional axisymmetric simulations . considering the uncertainties in heger s evolution calculations that they are one - dimensional models , which hinder the accurate treatment of the transport of the angular momentum and the generation of the magnetic fields , it should be still important to take the poloidal magnetic fields as the initial conditions .",
    "thus in this study , we choose to assume that only the poloidal magnetic fields exist prior to core - collapse , and then , prefer a parametric approach to construct the initial conditions varying the profiles of the initial poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "we assume the following two rotation laws and the four configurations of the magnetic fields .",
    "shell - type rotation : @xmath13 and shell - type magnetic fields , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an angular velocity , @xmath16 is the poloidal component of the magnetic fields , @xmath10 is radius , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are model constants ,    \\2 .",
    "cylindrical rotation : @xmath19 and cylindrical magnetic fields , @xmath20 and uniform cylindrical magnetic fields , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the poloidal magnetic fields parallel to the rotational ( @xmath23 ) axis , @xmath24 and @xmath23 denote distances from the rotational axis and the equatorial plane and @xmath25 are model constants .",
    "the other parameters have the same meanings as above .",
    "finally , we take into account the quadrupole magnetic fields following the prescription by @xcite , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the poloidal magnetic fields parallel to the equatorial plane and @xmath30 are model constants .    we have computed 11 models changing the combination of the strength of the angular momentum , the rotation law , the degree of differential rotation , and the profiles of the magnetic fields .",
    "for all the models , we fix the values of @xmath31 to be @xmath32 , where @xmath31 represents the ratio of the magnetic to the gravitational energy .",
    "the model parameters are presented in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "the models are named after this combination , with the first letter , `` s ( shell ) '' , `` c ( cylindrical ) '' , denoting the rotation profiles , the second letter , `` l ( long ) , s ( short ) '' , indicating the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the third letter `` ( u ) uniform , ( nu ) non uniform , ( q ) quadrupole '' indicating the configurations of the initial poloidal magnetic field , the fourth number -1 or -2 , representing that the initial @xmath35 is @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "note that the ratio of rotational energy to gravitational energy is designated as @xmath35 .",
    "we note that our choice of the initial value of @xmath35 is much smaller than the past magnetorotational studies in context of core - collapse supernovae @xcite to reconcile with the recent stellar evolution calculations of rotating stars @xcite .",
    "however it is still larger than the most slowest rotating models predicted by the most recent stellar calculations @xcite .",
    "as for the configurations of the initial magnetic fields , we prepared a variety of them in order to cover as wide the parametric space of the field configurations as possible .",
    "as for the initial strength of the magnetic fields , we pay particular attention to the models , which are assumed to have the strong poloidal magnetic fields ( @xmath6 g ) prior to core - collapse in order to see the parity - violating effects .",
    "astrophysically , such models are likely to associate with the formation of the so - called magnetars .",

    "we briefly summarize some dynamical aspects which will be helpful in the later discussions . for the more detailed magnetohydrodynamic computations during core - collapse , see also our accompanying paper @xcite .    in figure [ fig1 ] , the entropy distributions at the final states for some representative models",
    "are presented .",
    "the final time of all the models is about 50 ms after core bounce ( see table [ table:1 ] ) . at the final time , the shock wave produced at core bounce tends to stall in the core except for the models , which have the centrally condensed magnetic fields and rapid rotation with the strong differential rotation initially ( see figure [ fig1 ] and table [ table:1 ] for models cs(nu)-2 , ss(u)-1 , and ss(nu)-1 ) . even if the shock waves of such models manage to approach the outer boundary of the numerical simulation ( @xmath84 km ) along the rotational axis ,",
    "the explosion energy is about one order of magnitude less than the canonical one .",
    "thus , the neutrino heatings in the later phases should be necessary for the successful explosions .",
    "here it is noted that the final value of @xmath35 s and @xmath85 s for our models are well below the past mhd studies @xcite assuming rapid rotation prior to core - collapse . even in our slower rotating models",
    "than the previous simulations , it is found that the asymmetric matter motions can appear as seen from figure [ fig1 ] .    during core - collapse ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic fields exceeds the qed critical value @xmath86 ( g ) , above which the neutrino reactions are affected by the parity - violating corrections of weak interaction . just before core bounce , the poloidal magnetic fields dominate over the toroidal ones due to our assumption of the initial field configuration . after core bounce ,",
    "the strong differential rotations near the surface of the protoneutron star wraps the poloidal magnetic fields to convert into the toroidal ones , whose strength becomes as high as @xmath87 g at the final time of the simulations .",
    "the growth of the toroidal magnetic fields can be estimated by an order - of - magnitude estimation as follows , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the typical strength of the magnetic field parallel to the rotational axis just before core bounce , @xmath90 is the duration of the wrapping time , which is roughly equivalent to the time from core bounce to the final time , @xmath91 is the mean angular velocity at the surface of the protoneutron star .",
    "this estimation is roughly consistent with the numerical simulations .",
    "it is noted that the tangled toroidal magnetic fields ( @xmath92 ) are weaker than the poloidal ones ( @xmath93 ) at the final time in our models ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is an another candidate to amplify the growth of the toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "although the typical time scale @xcite corresponding to the maximum growth of mri ( @xmath94 ) at the surface of the protoneutron star is shorter than the simulation time scale ( @xmath95 ms ) , it is much longer than the growth time scale of the field wrapping ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus the amplification of the toroidal magnetic fields in our models is mainly as a result of the winding up original vertical poloidal fields .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the cumulative distribution of specific angular momentum is shown for models cs(u)-2 and cs(nu)-2 . in the magnetorotational core - collapse ,",
    "the anisotropic magnetic stress transfers the specific angular momentum of each fluid element outwards even in axisymmetry if the fluid rotates differentially .",
    "it is noted that the mass of the unshocked core is about @xmath97 in these models . from the figure",
    ", it is found that the transport of the angular momentum occurs more efficiently for the model cs(nu)-2 , whose initial magnetic fields are more centrally condensed , than the model cs(u)-2 ( compare the specific angular momentum in figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , there are regions just outside the unshocked core where the specific angular momentum decreases outwards . in such regions ,",
    "the so - called rayleigh instability condition holds , which induces the convection at the later phases near the surface of the unshocked core in the equatorial plane .",
    "these differences mentioned above stem only from the degree of the initial concentration of the magnetic fields between the pair models and are common to the other pair of the models .",
    "after the final time of our simulations , we calculate the shapes of the neutrino spheres by the prescription @xcite . although the magnetic fields become strong as @xmath5 g in the vicinity of the neutrino sphere ( @xmath98 km , density @xmath99 ) , the pressure of the magnetic fields ( @xmath100 ) are smaller than that of the matter ( @xmath101 ) in the corresponding region ( see the left panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus it is found that the magnetic fields do not affect the shape of the neutrino sphere significantly .",
    "in fact , the neutrino spheres are deformed to be oblate for the rapidly rotating models , on the other hand , to be rather spherical for the slowly rotating models ( see the right panel of figure [ fig3 ] and compare the shape of the neutrino sphere of model ss(nu)-1 ( : faster rotating model in our computation ) with that of the other models ( : slower rotating models ) ) .      based on the neutrino spheres obtained in the previous section",
    ", we will estimate the heating rates including the corrections from the parity - violating effects outside the neutrino sphere .",
    "this is admittedly a very crude estimate , since it is pointed out @xcite that the net heating , the heating minus cooling , becomes positive @xmath102 msec after the shock stagnation . in this respect",
    ", we confirmed that the cooling dominates over the heating also for our models including the corrections of the parity - violating effects . since our calculations ended before the heating dominates over the cooling , it is impossible to estimate the location of the gain radius , beyond where the heating dominates over the cooling .",
    "here it is noted that the contrast of the heating to the cooling is found to be similar in our short simulation runs .",
    "thus , the gain radius should be also deformed in the later phase .",
    "if this feature lasts in the later phase , the bare heating rate discussed in the following and the resultant neutrino asymmetry due to the parity - violating corrections , will help to understand the net neutrino asymmetry .",
    "hence , bearing this caveat in mind , we study the bare heating rate with the parity - violating effects for the final configurations ( several tens msec after the bounce ) in our simulations .",
    "first of all , we state how we estimate the neutrino heating rate in the strongly magnetized supernova core .",
    "the analysis scheme is schematically shown in figure [ neusp3dim ] .",
    "neutrinos are assumed to be emitted isotropically from each point on the neutrino sphere and stream freely later on",
    ". then the heating rate at a given point outside the neutrino sphere can be found by summing up all the rays from the neutrino sphere .",
    "the heating by electron neutrinos proceeds via the charged current interaction : @xmath103 we employ the corresponding cross section in a strongly magnetic field given by @xcite , which is expressed as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the corresponding cross section without the magnetic fields , @xmath106 , @xmath107 are the unit momentum vector for the incoming neutrinos and the unit vector along the magnetic field direction ( see figure [ neusp3dim ] ) , and @xmath108 is the asymmetry parameter given by @xmath109    here @xmath110 and @xmath111 are expressed in the leading order at the neutrino energies as @xmath112 and @xmath113\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\bigl[2~\\frac{c_{\\rm a}(c_{\\rm a } + c_{\\rm v } ) } { c_{\\rm v}^2 + 3 c_{\\rm a}^2}~\\frac{\\mu_{\\rm",

    "the configuration of the poloidal magnetic fields at the final state is presented in the top left panel of figure [ example_hikaku ] .",
    "it is seen from the panel that the poloidal magnetic fields are rather straight and parallel to the rotational axis in the regions near the rotational axis , on the other hand , bent in a complex manner , in the other central regions .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the core bounce occurs anisotropically due to rotation .",
    "this induces the convective motions .",
    "the magnetic fields are bent with the convective motions because the magnetic fields are frozen in fluid elements .",
    "this is because the ideal mhd is assumed in our simulations .",
    "the top right panel of figure [ example_hikaku ] shows the ratio of the neutrino heating rate corrected from the parity - violating effects , @xmath138 to the heating rate without the corrections , @xmath139 .",
    "note in the panel that the values of the color scale are expressed in percentage and that the central black region represents the region inside the neutrino sphere .",
    "it should be remembered that we took the two choices of @xmath35 as the initial condition . in the models with the smaller @xmath140 ,",
    "the shapes of the neutrino sphere are found to be rather spherical and the resultant neutrino heating from the neutrino sphere becomes almost isotropic ( see the models whose names end with `` -2 '' in the right panel of figure [ fig3 ] and table [ heat_hikaku ] ) . in such models",
    ", it is found that the initial rotation rate and magnetic field are not large enough to make the shapes of the neutrino sphere deviated from being spherically symmetric as in case of the pure rotation @xcite . in the top right panel , it is seen that the values of the ratio become negative in almost all the regions ( see also the bottom right panel of figure [ example_hikaku ] for clarity ) .",
    "this means that the heating rate is reduced by the magnetic fields than that without .",
    "especially , this tendency is most remarkable in the regions near the rotational axis and the surface of the neutrino sphere ( see the regions colored by blue in the top right panel of figure [ example_hikaku ] ) .",
    "these features can be understood as follows .",
    "let us remember that the first term in eq ( [ longformula ] ) represents the electron contribution arising from the ground landau level , and the other represents the contribution from the neutron and proton polarizations . by an order - of - magnitude estimation",
    ", it can be readily found that the first term dominates over the other in the central core , with typical values of @xmath141 . since the coefficient of the first term , which is proportional to the coupling constants of weak interactions ( @xmath142 , where @xmath143 ) is always negative , then the suppression or the enhancement of the heating rate through parity - violating effects is determined by the signs of the inner product of @xmath137 . as mentioned above , the magnetic fields are almost aligned and parallel to the rotational axis in the regions near the rotational axis . with the rather spherical neutrino emission , the values of the inner product becomes positive in the regions , which results in the reduction of the heating rate . on the other hand , the values of the ratio",
    "is found to become positive in some regions , where the poloidal magnetic fields are bent due to convections ( see the regions colored by red and colored by white in the top and bottom right panels of figure [ example_hikaku ] , respectively ) .",
    "in fact , the contributions of the inner product are negative in such regions . in the bottom left panel of figure [ example_hikaku ] ,",
    "the contour of the ratio in the 360 latitudinal degrees region of a star , is prepared in order to see the global asymmetry of the heating .",
    "since our simulations assume the equatorial symmetry , the above features in the northern part of the star become reverse for the southern part .",
    "these features on the global asymmetry of the neutrino heating rates are almost common to the other models . in the following , we state some important features of the global asymmetry produced by the difference of the initial rotation rate or the initial configurations of the magnetic fields",
    ".    the configurations of the poloidal magnetic fields and the ratio of @xmath144 for some representative models at the final states are shown in figure [ heat_mag ] .",
    "in the models , whose initial profile of the rotation law and the magnetic field is cylindrical with high central concentration ( the models whose name has ",
    "cs(nu )  ) , the shapes of the shock wave becomes very collimated near the rotational axis ( see the bottom left panel of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the final profile of the magnetic fields is also centrally concentrated with the strong magnetic fields ( @xmath145 g ) , which is favorable for the heating through parity - violating effects ( see the top left and right panels of figure [ heat_mag ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the regions , where the equatorial symmetry of the neutrino heating are broken , become rather wider at the north and the south poles than the other models , with the different initial profiles of the rotation and magnetic fields , while fixing the initial strength of rotation .",
    "if the initial strength of rotation is more large , the neutrino sphere is deformed to be more oblate due to the centrifugal force ( see the black region of the middle right panel of figure [ heat_mag ] ) .",
    "since the radii of the neutrino spheres tend to be smaller near the rotational axis than that in the equatorial plane ( see table [ heat_hikaku ] ) , the solid angle within which a point outside the neutrino sphere receives the rays from the neutrino sphere is enlarged for the vicinity of the rotational axis .",
    "this effect makes the neutrino heating near the rotational axis more efficient as in case of pure rotation @xcite .",
    "this rotation - induced anisotropic neutrino heating enhances the effect of the symmetry of the heating induced by the parity - violating corrections ( see the values of @xmath146 in table [ heat_hikaku ] and compare the values between the models with the same name except for the final number , for example , sl(u)-2 and sl(u)-1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the regions , which are heated asymmetrically , are enlarged for the faster rotating model than the slower rotating model ( compare the top right and the middle right panel of figure [ heat_mag ] ) .",
    "finally , we refer to the model whose initial profile of the magnetic field is quadrupole ( see the bottom panels of figure [ heat_mag ] ) . in such models , it is found that there appear the regions with the strong magnetic fields , which seem like the horns , near the rotational axis ranging from @xmath147 ( see the bottom left panel of figure [ heat_mag ] ) . as a result",
    ", the heating regions influenced by the parity - violating corrections , are found to become rather off - axis ( see the bottom right panel of figure [ heat_mag ] ) .",
    "in our computations , only electron neutrinos are treated approximately . since all the numerical simulations are limited to rather early phases ( @xmath148 50 msec )",
    ", it may not be a bad approximation . however , this is a certain limitation to the study of the later phases , which are more important to investigate the outcome of the north - south neutrino heating asymmetry discussed here .",
    "as already mentioned , if we take into the cooling , no heating region is found at these early times . as shown , for example , by @xcite , the heating region or ( the gain region ) appears more than @xmath149 msec after core bounce .",
    "hence , our estimate of anisotropic neutrino heating is admittedly a bold extrapolation to the later phases , which we have not computed yet .",
    "as stated , the multidimensional mhd simulations which solve the neutrino transport with the parity - violating reactions are required in order to compute the relation between the asymmetric neutrino heating induced by the parity - violating corrections and the pulsar - kick .",
    "although we hope that the general features obtained in this study will be taken over later on , further numerical investigations should be required in order to check the validity of our results .    as for the initial configurations of the poloidal magnetic fields , we assume that they have the same profile as the rotation .",
    "the assumption may not be unnatural because the angular momentum transfer in quasistatic stellar evolution is tightly connected to the formation of the magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , multidimensional and self - consistent calculations are required to be done for the understanding of the magnetorotational evolution of supernova progenitors .",
    "we performed a series of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supernova cores .",
    "as for the microphysics , we employ a realistic equation of state based on the relativistic mean field theory and take into account electron captures and the neutrino transport via the neutrino leakage scheme .",
    "since the profiles of the angular momentum and the magnetic fields of strongly magnetized stars are still quite uncertain , we constructed 11 initial models changing the combination of the strength of the angular momentum , the rotations law , the degree of differential rotation , and the profiles of the magnetic fields in order to cover as wide a parametric freedom as possible .",
    "based on the numerical simulations , we estimated how the rotation - induced anisotropic neutrino heating is changed by the parity - violating corrections of neutrinos under the strong magnetic fields . by so doing , we investigated the global asymmetry of the neutrino heating in a strongly magnetized supernova core . as a result , we found the following .",
    "\\1 . at the prompt - shock timescale ( @xmath95 ms after core bounce )",
    ", the toroidal magnetic fields are formed mainly by the wrapping of the initial poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "the strength of the toroidal magnetic fields is smaller than the poloidal ones at the timescale .",
    "although the growth timescale of mri corresponding to the fastest growing mode of the instability is within the prompt - shock timescale , it is much longer than the growth of the wrapping timescale .",
    "the inefficiency of the growth of mri is due to the initial slow rotation rates prior to core - collapse , which reconciles with the results of the state - of - the - art stellar evolution calculations .    \\2 .",
    "whether the parity - violating corrections in the strong magnetic fields suppress or enhance the heating rate than that without the corrections is found to be simply determined by the inner product of the unit vector of incoming neutrinos ( @xmath150 ) and the unit vector along the magnetic field direction ( @xmath107 ) . in the models except those with the quadrupole magnetic fields initially ,",
    "the poloidal magnetic fields near the rotational axis are almost aligned and parallel to the axis at the prompt - shock timescale .",
    "although the neutrino emission is almost spherical in the slowly rotating models with the initial values of @xmath140 , the values of the inner product becomes positive in the regions by the geometry of the magnetic field lines .",
    "this results in the reduction of the neutrino heating rates . in the faster rotating models with the initial values of @xmath151 ,",
    "the rotation - induced anisotropic neutrino heating is found to more enhance the asymmetric heating induced by the parity - violating correction than in case of the slower rotating models .",
    "this is because the rotation - induced neutrino heating heats the regions near the rotational axis more efficiently , where the magnetic fields are typically strongest .",
    "the ratio of the correction to the heating rate to the heating rate without the magnetic fields is found to range from @xmath152 to @xmath153 .    from the above results ,",
    "the parity - violating corrections reduces about @xmath154 of the heating rate than that without the magnetic fields in the vicinity of the north pole , on the other hand , enhances about @xmath154 in the vicinity of the south pole of a star .",
    "based on the results , we speculate that the neutron star might be kicked toward the north pole in the subsequent time , if the asymmetry of the neutrino heating in the north and the south poles develop in the later phases . this is because @xcite .",
    "recently pointed out the random velocity perturbation with an amplitude of @xmath155 % added artificially at several milliseconds after bounce can be a seed of the global asymmetry of the supernova shock and a cause of the pulsar - kick . in their models .",
    "the orientation of pulsar - kicks depends stochastically on the initial random perturbation .",
    "this is the case for the observed pulsars with the canonical magnetic fields ( @xmath156 g ) .",
    "however , the asymmetry of the neutrino heating in the strong magnetic fields ( @xmath157 g ) considered here might have influence on the alignment of spin and the space velocity of the pulsar associated with the formation of the magnetars .",
    "although no pulsar kicks with the very strong magnetic fields , have been observed so far , the alignment of spin and the space velocity of the magnetars is expected to be observed by future observations .    as stated earlier ,",
    "our simulations are crude in the treatment of microphysics compared with recent spherical models .",
    "this might be justified as long as we study the earlier phase in the prompt - explosion timescale .",
    "we are currently developing a two - dimensional neutrino transport code , which will be necessary to test the validity of implications obtained in this study ( kotake et al .",
