    "according to the _ recycling _ model ( e.g. @xcite ) millisecond - or recycled - pulsars ( msps ) are formed in binary systems where the companion star transfers mass , and hence angular momentum , onto the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "extended mass transfer from low mass companions can cause the ns to be spun up to rotational periods of at least 1.5 milliseconds .",
    "higher mass systems , transferring mass over shorter time scales and mostly via a wind @xcite , can not push the recycling process down to periods below @xmath0 20 milliseconds . at the same time , due to still unclear mechanisms , possibly linked to the accreted mass itself , the magnetic field b is decreased down to @xmath1 g.    about 75% of all known msps in the galactic field ( i.e. outside globular clusters , where exchange interactions can change the final outcome of the evolution of an msp ) are found in binary systems ( data from the atnf pulsar catalogue[multiblock footnote omitted ] ; @xcite ) , supporting the above scenario . the formation path of isolated msps ,",
    "though , is still a matter of debate : those with spin periods of few tens of ms or more could derive from double neutron star systems disrupted during the second supernova explosion ( disrupted recycled pulsars , drps ; @xcite ) while the shorter period pulsars could be the result of a binary system where the companion was so light that the interaction with the pulsar wind was able to completely destroy it @xcite",
    ". there are now a few examples of the so called _ black widow _",
    "( bw ) pulsar systems @xcite , in which the companion star is very light and in which the radio signal is eclipsed by matter ablated from the companion for significant parts of the orbit .",
    "these objects have been suggested as possible progenitors of the shorter period isolated msps , although the ablation time scales seem to be generally too long for this process @xcite .",
    "untill recently very few bw pulsars were known in the galactic field .",
    "the situation has changed in the last few years thanks to deep radio follow - ups of gamma - ray point sources detected by the lat @xcite instrument on board the _ fermi _ satellite ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , through which also binary pulsars whose radio signal was eclipsed for a large fraction of the orbit were discovered .",
    "we note that , in average black widows detected through this channel are more energetic , show longer eclipses and have lighter companions than those previously known , hence it is likely that the mass loss rate is higher and the time for complete ablation of their companions shorter .",
    "other possible explanations of the formation of isolated msps invoke different paths : one example is the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf @xcite , another is white dwarf mergers @xcite .",
    "finding intrinsic differences between the two msp populations might point to a different origin and/or evolutionary path for the isolated msps .",
    "msps are more stable clocks than the non - recycled pulsars ( psrs ) .",
    "when in binary systems , their stable rotation allows precise determination of the keplerian orbital parameters and , in some cases , also the post - keplerian parameters , making these pulsars laboratories for testing relativistic gravity in the strong field regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the rotational stability and timing precision are high enough , msps can be used in timing arrays for gravitational wave detection @xcite .    the high time resolution universe survey ( htru ; @xcite ) , whose observations started at the parkes observatory ( nsw , australia ) in 2008 , was primarily designed to discover msps missed in previous surveys .",
    "thanks to the new digital backends adopted in this experiment , the time and frequency resolutions have improved by a factor of 4 and 8 respectively .",
    "this allows the survey to sample a much larger volume of the galaxy for short period pulsars as the deleterious effects of dispersion are greatly diminished .",
    "the suitability of the chosen parameters of the survey to discover msps has been already demonstrated in @xcite where we presented the first five new objects of this class found in the intermediate latitude ( @xmath2 ) part of the survey . in this paper",
    "we present the discovery and timing parameters of five further such objects , confirming the very high potential of our acquisition system .    in section  [ sec : time ] we briefly describe the follow - up observations and report the spin , orbital and astrometric parameters resulting from the timing campaign on the five discovered msps , highlighting their potential as ` test particles ' in the timing array experiments . given the increased sample of recycled pulsars , in  [ sec : lum ] we revise the luminosity distribution of isolated versus binary msps and find them to be very different . in  [ sec : mw ] we briefly report on the search for gamma - ray counterparts to our discoveries . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : pol ] we describe the polarimetric characteristics for four of the new discoveries .",
    "of the five newly discovered msps , four were found in the data of the intermediate latitude part of the htru survey , consisting of 540s pointings covering the area enclosed by galactic coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath2 .",
    "the fifth , j2236@xmath45527 , was discovered in the high latitude part of the survey : 270s pointings covering the entire southern sky below declination @xmath5 ( except the intermediate latitude part mentioned above ) .    when a pulsar is discovered only its approximate spin period , dispersion measure ( dm",
    ", i.e. the free electron column density along the line of sight ) and position are known . to ensure that the full potential of these discoveries is exploited , a precise determination of the pulsars position is needed ( e.g. to look for counterparts at other wavelengths ; see  [ sec : mw ] ) and",
    "accurate measurements of the spin , astrometric , and if they belong to a binary system , orbital parameters are necessary . to obtain these parameters",
    "one has to start a follow - up timing campaign covering a time span of at least one year .    for the htru msps , confirmations ,",
    "gridding observations ( aimed at determining a more precise position for the pulsar with a grid of 5 adjacent pointings ; @xcite ) and the first timing observations , are done with the same instrumentation used for the survey pointings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this allows the raw data to be retained with all the time samples and the frequency channels , in such a way as to be able to recover the periodic signal even if the apparent spin period is significantly different from the discovery one because of orbital motion .",
    "the rest of the timing observations , done with an approximately monthly cadence , are performed either with the parkes 64-m telescope or , for the objects visible from the northern hemisphere , with the lovell telescope ( jodrell bank , manchester , uk ) . at both sites an atnf digital filterbank ( dfb )",
    "is used as backend and most of the observations are performed at a wavelength close to 20 cm . in particular , at the parkes telescope the data are acquired over 256 mhz of bandwidth centered at a frequency of 1369 mhz and split into 1024 frequency channels , while the lovell data cover a frequency range of 384 mhz centred at 1532 mhz and split into 1024 frequency channels , more than 1/4 of which , untill september 2012 , were removed trough a bandpass filter because of radio frequency interferences ( rfi ) . after that date",
    "the lovell data have been manuallly cleaned from rfi and a larger part of the band has been used .",
    "dfb data are folded on - line using the pulsar ephemeris obtained from the first stages of timing and refined as the follow - up observations proceed .",
    "observations of psrj1832@xmath40836 at jodrell bank were performed also using the _ roach _ pulsar backend .",
    "this backend uses a roach fpga board[multiblock footnote omitted ] to perform either baseband recording or coherent dedispersion of two 8-bit nyquist sampled orthogonal polarisations over a total bandwidth of 512mhz .",
    "after sampling and digitization , the roach board channelizes the signal into 32 sub - bands of 16mhz , each of which is coherently dedispersed and folded using an 8-core intel xeon computer running the ` dspsr ` software package @xcite .",
    "as the total usable bandwidth of the l - band receiver is 400mhz , the data from 25 subbands is combined and analyzed with the ` psrchive ` package[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite .",
    "also in this case about 1/4 of the bandwidth was removed because of rfi untill september 2012 .",
    "after about one year of timing observations the covariance in the timing parameters is broken and a precise timing solution is obtained .",
    "times of arrival are obtained using from through cross - correlation with an analytic profile template created by fitting von mises functions to profile components .",
    "table [ tab1 ] reports the main detection characteristics of the five newly discovered pulsars : for each object the timing position in galactic coordinates , the beam in which the pulsar was detected , the radial distance of the pulsar from the discovery beam centre in units of the beam radius , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the discovery observation , the mean flux density @xmath6 and the pulse widths at 50% and 10% of the peak of the mean pulse profile are listed .",
    "for the three pulsars timed at the parkes observatory , the values of the fluxes are properly calibrated on a reference source ( see  [ sec : pol ] )",
    ". for polarisation measurement purposes ( see  [ sec : pol ] ) j1832@xmath40836 , timed over more than one year with the lovell telescope , was also observed on one occasion for @xmath7 hrs with the parkes radio telescope and hence as also properly flux calibrated .",
    "the flux density value for the remaining pulsar has been obtained using the radiometer equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) scaled using the calibrated flux densities of the other four msps . for j1545@xmath44550 , for which we have a flux measurement also at 10 cm and 40 cm , we could calculate a spectral index @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 for the main peak , and a steeper , though less constrained , spectral index of @xmath11 for the second peak .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     polarisation studies are fundamental to investigate the geometry of pulsars as well as their magnetic fields and radio beam structures . in the ideal case ,",
    "the interpretation of the results of this kind of analysis could be carried out using the rotating vector model ( rvm ) by @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that the position angle of the linear polarisation ( @xmath12 ) is tied to that of the pulsar magnetic field lines . in this way ,",
    "its prediction is to observe a swing of the polarisation angle ( pa ) curve across the pulse ( that should produce a characteristic `` s - shape '' ) , due to the sweeping of the observer s line of sight through the radio beam .",
    "the fit of the model should permit the inclination between the magnetic and the rotational axes and the impact parameter between the line of sight and the magnetic axis to be obtained .",
    "this however is not always possible , for example because the polarisation signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is not high enough to allow a good determination of the pa , or the pulse is so narrow that there is not enough information to constrain the fit , or also because the predicted pa swing is not displayed ( for a thorough discussion of the difficulties and limitation of the rvm see @xcite ) .",
    "msp pas , in particular , often display jumps or discontinuities in the pa profile : this is the case of our msps , as described below , for which hence a fit using the rvm has not been possible .      the pulse profile for j1431@xmath45740 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : j1431 ] ) shows a single slightly asymmetric peak .",
    "the linear polarisation , however , displays two peaks , whereof the leading is fainter and wider in amplitude than the trailing .",
    "the minimum of the linear polarisation occurs roughly at the phase of the peak in the total intensity profile .",
    "the pas in correspondence with the leading peak show a slightly decreasing slope , while the pa curve of the trailing component is flat .",

    "it acquires statistical significance when comparing the 20-cm profile to the 40-cm one ( bottom panel of fig .",

    "the linear polarisation profile follows the total intensity one , and the percentage of @xmath13 under every component is very high , especially beneath the second peak .",
    "the pa curve of the component with higher snr shows a short , steep rise and a smooth decline toward the separation between the first and the second component . a similar smooth decline with almost the same inclination",
    "is shown by the pa curve of the third peak , while that of the second one is flatter and exhibits a jump of @xmath15 with respect to the first .",

    "are not as high s / n as the 20-cm one . at 10 cm ( top panel of figure [",
    "fig : j1546 ] ) the first peak appears @xmath16 per cent narrower than at 20 cm and the third peak is statistically undetectable .",
    "the linear and circular polarisation profiles of the main peak behave as at 20 cm , while the second peak appears to be unpolarised .",
    "the 40-cm profile ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : j1546 ] ) shows four components : besides the three clearly present at 20 cm , whose peaks are closer together at this lower frequency , a fourth component precedes in phase the main peak by 1/3 . the percentage of linear polarisation of the main peak drops by about 30 per cent with respect to the 20-cm value , while the second and third peaks appear 100 per cent linearly polarised ( even though for the latter , as for the fourth peak , the statistic is quite poor ) .",
