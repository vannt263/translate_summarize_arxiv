    "the odd fourier coefficients are zero by symmetry .",
    "however , fluctuations in the positions of the participating nucleons can lead to non - smooth density distribution , which will fluctuate on event - by - event basis .",
    "the participating nucleons then determine the symmetry plane ( @xmath4 ) , which fluctuate around the reaction plane @xcite . as a result",
    "odd harmonics , which were exactly zero for smoothed initial distribution , can be developed .",
    "it has been conjectured that third harmonic @xmath5 , which is response of the initial triangularity of the medium , is responsible for the observed structures in two particle correlation in au+au collisions @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",

    "no such increase is seen in simulations . as shown in fig.[f2 ]",
    "the event averaged elliptic and triangular flow are approximately independent of the event size .",
    "more importantly , the variances are also approximately independent of event size .",
    "the result confirms that fluctuations are systematic rather than statistical .",
    "we may mention here that the present model of fluctuating initial conditions do not induce large fluctuations in the @xmath50 transverse momentum spectra , @xmath56 spectra remain largely unaffected .",
    "the model is also consistent with the experimental observation that in central collisions , elliptic and triangular flows are of similar magnitude , but in peripheral collisions , elliptic flow dominates .    in fig.[f3",
    "] , viscosity dependence of integrated elliptic and triangular flow is shown . with initial conditions both @xmath6 and @xmath5 fluctuates .",

    "uncertainty in @xmath5 is @xmath5550% .",
    "larger fluctuations in @xmath5 is not unexpected . as shown in fig.[f1 ] , triangularity fluctuates more strongly than the eccentricity .",
    "it is then expected that the @xmath5 will fluctuate more strongly than @xmath6 .",
    "integrated triangular flow also does not show any viscosity dependence .    in fig.[f4 ] and",
    "[ f5 ] , differential elliptic and triangular flow is shown as a function of viscosity . average value of @xmath57 and @xmath58 decreases with increasing viscosity , however , both elliptic and triangular flow fluctuates strongly . in",
    "the @xmath56 range 1 - 3 gev , fluctuations in @xmath57 is @xmath5515 - 20% .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath58 is even more @xmath5570 - 80% .",
    "the fluctuations in anisotropic flow greatly reduce their efficacy as a diagnostic tool .",
    "for example , within the fluctuations , differential elliptic flow does not distinguish between ideal fluid and fluid with viscosity to entropy ratio 0.08 .",
    "triangular flow is even more insensitive .",
    "fluid viscosity varying between 0 - 0.16 is not distinguished .",
    "triangular flow depends on the definition of triangularity . in the above simulations ,",
    "we have used the definition due to teaney and yan @xcite . as noted earlier , alver and rolland @xcite used an alternate definition for triangularity ( see eq.[eq6 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath5 in the two definitions . in fig.[f6 ] , for fluid viscosity @xmath8=0.08 and 0.16 , triangular flow from the two definitions is compared .",
    "average triangular flow and its fluctuations are approximately similar in both the definitions .",
    "the result is understood .",
    "triangular flow depend explicitly on the participant plane angle @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath59 is not changed much between the two definition .",
    "for example , in the present simulation , out of 500 events , in @xmath55400 events @xmath59 in two definitions differ by less than 10% . marginal change in @xmath59 lead to similar triangular flow .",
    "can the fluctuations in @xmath5 be reduced ?",
    "as demonstrated earlier , larger event size do not reduce the fluctuations .",
    "one of the parameter of the model is the gaussian width @xmath39 of the hot spots .",
    "initial density distribution become more asymmetric if @xmath39 is reduced .",
    "we have used @xmath39=1 fm .",
    "explicit simulations indicate that if @xmath39 is reduced to 0.5 fm , in the @xmath56 range 1 - 3 gev , average of triangular flow increase by a factor of @xmath552 , the fluctuations however remains largely unaltered . in a more realistic simulation ,",
    "impact parameter would also fluctuate and fluctuations in @xmath5 will be even more . indeed , if the initial state fluctuations are the only source of the triangular flow , large fluctuations in the triangular flow is inevitable .",
    "fluctuations will reduce if , apart from initial triangularity , jet quenching , cerenkov radiation etc .",
    "also contribute to the triangular flow .",
    "indeed , hydrodynamical simulations indicate that triangularity in density distribution can be developed due to jet quenching ( see fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) , whose response would be the triangular flow .",
    "in a simple model of fluctuating initial states , we have studied fluctuations in elliptic and triangular flow in ideal and viscous fluid evolution . it is shown that fluctuations in triangular flow can be very large .",
    "large fluctuation reduces the sensitivity of flow coefficients to viscosity . for example",
    ", fluctuations of elliptic flow make it insensitive to variation of viscosity to entropy ratio in the range @xmath8=0 - 0.08 .",
    "fluctuations in triangular flow are even larger and viscosity to entropy ratio varying between 0 - 0.16 is not distinguished .",
    "we conclude that if the initial state fluctuations are the only source of triangular flow , triangular flow will be greatly insensitive to viscosity .",
