    "<S> we present high - precision non - relativistic variational calculations of bound vibrational - rotational state energies for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecular ions in each of the lowest electronic states of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are carried out including coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath6 states but without using the born - oppenheimer or any adiabatic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> convergence studies are presented which indicate that the resulting energies for low - lying levels are accurate to about @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure accounts naturally for the lambda - doubling of the @xmath4 state . </S>"
