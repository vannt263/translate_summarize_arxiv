    "electron transport through small metallic islands is strongly influenced by the charging energy associated with low capacitance of the junctions @xcite .",

    "if the conductance of the barriers is low @xmath0 they can be described within the `` orthodox theory''@xcite which treats tunneling in lowest order perturbation theory ( golden rule ) .",
    "this corresponds to the classical picture of incoherent , sequential tunneling processes . on the other hand ,",
    "there is experimental and theoretical evidence that in several regimes higher - order tunneling processes have to be taken into account .",
    "first , in the coulomb blockade regime , sequential tunneling is exponentially suppressed . the leading contribution to",

    "the transition rate of this `` inelastic cotunneling '' process was evaluated at zero temperature .",

    "this was done within an approximation which is valid far away from the resonances . in this regime ,",
    "their results have been confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "second , at resonance , even though sequential tunneling occurs , higher - order processes have a significant effect on the gate - voltage dependent linear and nonlinear conductance @xcite .",
    "the energy gap between two adjacent charge states as well as the tunneling conductance is renormalized .",
    "similar effects have been discussed for the equilibrium properties of the single - electron box @xcite . a diagrammatic real - time technique developed for metallic islands @xcite as well as for quantum dots @xcite allows a systematic description of the nonequilibrium tunneling processes .",
    "the effects of quantum fluctuations become observable either for strong tunneling @xmath2 or at low temperatures @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the charging energy ( see below ) .",
    "the theory has been evaluated in ref .   in the limit where only two adjacent charge states are included ( even virtually ) .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to introduce a bandwidth cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "the predicted broadening of the conductance peak as well as the reduction of its height has been confirmed qualitatively in recent experiments on a single - electron transistor in the strong tunneling regime by joyez _",
    ". however , a quantitative fit between theory and experiment requires introducing a renormalized value for the charging energy .    in ref .",
    ", we have used the real - time diagrammatic technique to obtain the current in second order in @xmath1 at low temperature when only two adjacent charge states are classically occupied , but _ all _ relevant virtual states are included . in this case",

    ", we generalize the analysis of ref .   in the following points : +  we allow for arbitrary temperature .",
    "our theory is , therefore , applicable both in the coulomb blockade regime at low temperature as well as the classical regime at high temperature . while the effects of cotunneling are most dramatic in the first case , signatures of the higher order contributions are visible even in the second case .",
    "+  we allow for arbitrary transport voltage , i.e. , also extreme non - equilibrium situations are included in which more than two charge states are classically occupied .",

    "this renormalization shows up in our formulas in new terms which are crucial at resonance .",
