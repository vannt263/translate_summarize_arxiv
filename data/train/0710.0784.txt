    "because of radiative cooling and the fast expansion of the exploding mantle of the progenitor massive star , photospheric - phase type ii sn spectra evolve rapidly . at shock breakout the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks in the far - uv and x - rays .",
    "subsequently the sed centers in the uv , then in the optical , and later in the infrared until the object fades from view . from a radiative transfer perspective",
    ", the cooling induces a recombination to lower ionization stages that impose a strong blanketing effect on the energy distribution .",
    "a few days after explosion , the ejecta radiate a uv - dominated sed , with heii4686  ( only observed at a few days after shock breakout ; dessart et al . 2007 ) , balmer / paschen lines of hydrogen , hei5875 , hei10830 , some multiplets of oii and nii multiplets at 4600  ( see dessart & hillier 2006a ; baron et al .",
    "2007 ) , nii5400 , and a few isolated resonance lines such as mgii2802  and aliii1859 .",
    "as the ejecta continue to cool , hydrogen eventually recombines , with a contemporaneous enhancement in line - blanketing due to the switch from feiii to feii . in dessart & hillier ( 2006 ) and",
    "dessart et al . (",
    "2007 ) , we successfully modeled these epochs for sne 1999em , 2005cs , and 2006bp , using steady - state non - lte cmfgen models and a power - law density distribution with an exponent of ten ( the immediate post - breakout phase requires higher values for this exponent ) .",
    "these spectroscopic analyses deliberately focused on the first @xmath045 days after shock breakout , since , beyond that time , we encountered severe difficulties in reproducing the hydrogen lines .",
    "specifically , at late times , synthetic line profiles were sizably narrower than observed , suggesting that line formation regions predicted by cmfgen were confined to velocities / radii that were too small . despite a continued success with reproducing the overall continuum energy distribution ,",
    "cmfgen failed to reproduce important line profiles , whenever hydrogen started recombining at and above the photosphere .",
    "the h@xmath1 problem has not been clearly emphasized in the literature , where one can see a great disparity in model atmosphere assumptions and agreement between theoretical predictions and observations , but no direct link to physical / numerical issues . in the eighties and early nineties ,",
    "the recognized importance of non - lte effects confronted the strong limitations of computer technology , so that only a few species were treated in non - lte ( i.e. , usually hydrogen and helium ) , while the metals responsible for line blanketing were treated in lte .",
    "@xcite followed this approach to model the first ten days of sn 1987a , and did not encounter obvious difficulties with hydrogen lines .",
    "@xcite , using an approximate non - lte technique , had , on the contrary , great difficulty reproducing any of the balmer lines , suggesting clumping as the culprit .",
    "@xcite reproduced the sn 1987a spectral evolution and the hydrogen lines , over many months , using a large `` turbulent '' velocity . in the more sophisticated non - lte cmfgen",
    "@xcite models presented in @xcite , we found that decreasing the turbulent velocity weakened line - blanketing effects and increased , although only modestly , the strength of hydrogen lines .",
    "however , beyond 40 days after explosion , this tuning had no longer any important influence on the hydrogen lines .",
    "the non - lte model atmosphere code phoenix predicts strong balmer lines at the hydrogen recombination epoch @xcite , but this may stem from their adoption of non - thermal ionization / excitation due to @xmath2ni at the photosphere , sometimes just a few days after explosion and in mass shells moving at @xmath310000 in sn 1987a @xcite or @xmath09000 in sn 1993w @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of core - collapse sne predict that @xmath2ni has velocities of at most @xmath04000 , the nickel fingers being strongly decelerated at the h / he interface @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this disagreement extends far beyond the uncertainties of explosion models and suggests a genuine incompatibility .",
    "interestingly , hi lines remain strong for months in all type ii sne , in objects as diverse as the `` peculiar '' sn 1987a , the `` plateau '' sn 1999em , and the `` low - luminosity '' sn 1999br .",
    "cmfgen models computed for these objects were unable to reproduce balmer lines after @xmath04 days in sn 1987a , @xmath040 days in sn 1999em , and @xmath020 days in sn 1999br , all coincident with hydrogen recombination in the ejecta .",
    "these three sne have very different inferred ejecta properties and observed light curves .",
    "sn 1999br even synthesized an order of magnitude less @xmath2ni than average @xcite for the type ii class .",
    "the only common property between these objects , which is connected to the h@xmath1 problem , is the recombination of the ejecta to a lower ionization state at the corresponding epoch .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* uc05 ) proposed that the effect of time - dependence , and the energy associated with changes in ionization / excitation , lead to a strong h@xmath1 line profile in sn 1987a during the recombination epoch .",
    "they also found that barium lines were affected , and that , with their more consistent approach , baii6142  could be fitted using the lmc metallicity value .",
    "the steady - state models of @xcite supported instead an abundance enhancement of five .    time dependence has been invoked in the past by @xcite to explain the late - time light curve of sn 1987a , and the theoretical study of @xcite showed that time dependence _ in the radiation field _ had a critical impact on the radiative transfer in type ias .",
    "@xcite , however , treat the material in lte , i.e. , do not solve the rate equations , focusing instead on the time - dependent _ diffusion _ of photons through an optically thick type ia sn ejecta . similarly , @xcite neglect explicit time dependence in the rate equations , computing the ionization and excitation state of the medium in lte .",
    "thus , although there is at present growing interest in accounting for time dependence in the radiation field , the often - used expedient of lte , to maintain low cpu costs , has forced the neglect of both non - lte and time - dependence in the level populations .",
    "one exception to these time - dependent lte approaches is the work of @xcite , who treats time - dependence in the rate equations but , to our knowledge , has not discussed the associated effects on type ii sn spectra . in the present study , we investigate thoroughly the effects of time - dependence in the rate equations and their impact on inferred ejecta properties . note that time dependence in the radiation field is accounted for by adjusting the base luminosity so that the emergent synthetic flux matches the observed flux , using the bolometric - light evolution of sn 1999em as a guide @xcite .    here , we report the salient features of several _ time - dependent _ non - lte cmfgen simulations , covering the early evolution for a range of type ii sn ejecta .",
    "we confirm the results of uc05 that time - dependence induces an over - ionization of the recombining ejecta and that it solves the h@xmath1 problem .",
    "however unlike uc05 , we self - consistently solve the radiation transfer equation  the coupling between the level populations and the radiation field is calculated and fully allowed for .",
    "our more comprehensive study of the full spectrum further predicts that all lines , not just those of hydrogen , are significantly affected .",
    "the ionization of the ejecta and its evolution are so strongly modified that we predict even hei10830  many weeks after explosion .    in the next section , we present out treatment of time - dependence in cmfgen , which focuses here on the terms appearing in the statistical and radiative equilibrium equations ( an appendix also provides further details ) . in  2.5 , we present the various model calculations performed to illustrate our discussion . in  3",
    ", we present our results , discussing the effects of time dependence on the ejecta properties as well as the associated spectroscopic signatures .",
    "we then present in  4 a comparison with a few representative observations , focusing on the well observed type ii plateau sn 1999em and the low luminosity type ii sn 1999br . in  5 , we discuss the implications of such time - dependent effects on our understanding and on our modeling of photospheric - phase type ii sn spectra , before giving our conclusions in  6 .",
    "note that the salient features and key results presented here are also available in a concise , `` letter '' , format in @xcite , to which we refer the hurried reader .",
    "where @xmath5 is the velocity , @xmath6 is the population of state @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the transition rate from state @xmath7 to state @xmath9",
    ". the forms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are standard , and can be found , for example , in mihalas ( 1978 ) .",
    "for simplicity we have not distinguished between the different processes ( collisional , bound - free , and bound - bound ) entering these rates .    in massive stars ,",
    "the winds can be approximated as stationary . in such cases",
    "we consider a eulerian formulation , and take @xmath12 to be zero .",
    "the @xmath13 term is the advection term , and is usually neglected , however it can become important in the outer regions of the wind , since the ratio of the recombination time , @xmath14 , to the flow time , @xmath15 , scales as the radius , @xmath16 ( here , @xmath1 is the recombination coefficient ) .",
    "supernovae are obviously time dependent , and in this case it makes sense to use a lagrangean formalism . using the continuity equation                    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 refer to values at consecutive time steps but with the same comoving coordinate . for a hubble flow",
    ", we can simply use the velocity as the lagrangean co - ordinate .",
    "the solution of these equations proceeds in an identical fashion to that used to solve the steady - state statistical equilibrium equations ( hillier 1987 ; hillier 1990 ; hillier & miller 1998 ) ; the only distinction is that we have a `` source '' term that comes from the populations at an earlier time step .          where @xmath25 is the internal energy / unit mass , @xmath26 the opacity , @xmath27 the emissivity , and @xmath28 the mean intensity , and we have ignored other forms of energy deposition ( such as nuclear decay ) .",
    "@xmath25 can be written in the form              in the above , @xmath32 is the total particle density ( excluding electrons ) , @xmath33 is the electron density , and @xmath34 is the total energy ( excitation and ionization ) of state @xmath7 .",
    "this equation is solved implicitly , via linearization , and is no more difficult to treat than the regular constraint of radiative equilibrium .",
    "below we examine when the time dependent terms in the statistical equilibrium equations will play an important role in determining the radiative transfer in sn envelopes . to do this",
    ", we need to compare the time it takes to replenish the population of individual levels with the flow time .",
    "as noted previously , the flow - time scale is simply @xmath15 , and for a hubble flow this is @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is the time since the explosion .",
    "we will only examine the ionization equilibrium in detail , since it is the ionization equilibrium that will be most affected by the time - dependent terms  statistical equilibrium of excited levels will generally be satisfied because the radiatives rates tend to be large ( @xmath36s@xmath37 ) , and the transitions have low ( or moderate ) optical depths .",
    "the simplest recombination timescale can be found by estimating the time it takes , at fixed electron density , for all ions to recombine .",
    "thus the recombination timescale for hydrogen , @xmath38 is simply given by          we use @xmath43 since in sn conditions every direct recombination to the ground state will generally be followed by an ionization .",
    "the recombination time scale for hei is very similar to that of hi . since the comoving density is @xmath44 , the ratio of recombination time to the flow time , at a given velocity , scales as @xmath45 . thus the ionization must eventually become frozen , and first at high velocities .",
    "the previous discussion refers to the case when we can ignore optical depth effects and the existence of metastable states . when optical depth effects are important , and/or there exist low lying metastable states , it is more difficult to ascertain the relevant recombination time scale . in such cases , it is the net flow of electrons to the ground state that will set the ionization equilibrium .                here",
    "@xmath49 is used to denote the ion population , @xmath50 is the photoionization rate , @xmath51 refers to the combined rate for processes which couple level 2 to 1 ( bound - bound , collisional , two photon decay ) , while @xmath52 refers to processes that excite an electron from level 1 to 2 .",
    "we assume that the ground state continuum is in detailed balance . for a strict two - level atom @xmath53 but",
    "for these discussions we can take @xmath54 .                                for hei 2s@xmath56",
    ", we have @xmath71two phot@xmath72s@xmath37 , @xmath73hz , @xmath74@xmath75 , and , assuming @xmath76 , and @xmath77k , we find @xmath78 thus , it is apparent that the effective recombination time scale is much longer than the classic recombination time scale , and could easily be comparable to the flow time scale .",
    "we appreciate that the true situation is more complex than that discussed above .",
    "for hei the 2s@xmath56 and 2p@xmath79 state are both metastable , and there is a collisonal coupling between the singlet and triplet terms .",
    "the 2s@xmath56 state can decay directly to the ground state , for example , by two - photon decay , by collisional de - excitation , and by collisional excitation to the 2p@xmath80p@xmath81 state followed by a radiative decay .",
    "further , the effective recombination rate will substantially exceed the classic recombination time scale only if the resonance line is optically thick . despite these caveats ,",
    "it is apparent that the time - dependent terms might be important even at the photosphere , and must be included .",
    "a simple comparison between the flow time scale and the classic recombination time scale can greatly underestimate the importance of these time - dependent terms .    in the appendix we examine , in detail , the various processes that influence the ionization of helium at a representative depth , and in a typical model , and where the flow time is significantly greater than the classic recombination time . in that appendix",
    "we show that the combination of optical depth effects , and the existence of metastable levels , leads the time - dependent terms to cause a delay in the recombination of he@xmath82 to neutral he .    for hi , the 2s state is metastable , but in atmospheric calculations ( as is done here ) it is usually assumed to be in lte with respect to the 2p state (",
    "i.e. , the 2s and 2p states have the same departure coefficients ) .",
    "thus the relevant time scale is set by radiative decay from level 2p to 1s , and , hence , by the ly@xmath1 optical depth , as was previously noted by uc05 .",
    "other processes or configurations ( e.g. , overlapping lines , continuum opacity ) can also be important since they can destroy a ly@xmath1 photon , facilitating a `` real '' recombination to the ground state .",
    "finally we stress , as apparent from the above discussion , that the time - dependent term does not directly change the ionization equilibrium ( unlike the situation at low electron densities ) .",
    "rather , it prevents the decay of electrons from the @xmath83 states ( for hi and hei ) to the ground state .",
    "the ionization of hi and hei can then be maintained by ionizations from these excited states .",
