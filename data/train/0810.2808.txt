    "dissipative solitons ( ds ) are spatially localized structures that appear in certain nonlinear dissipative media @xcite .",
    "they have been found in systems such as chemical reactions @xcite , vegetation models @xcite , gas discharge systems @xcite , fluids @xcite and optics @xcite . while in many instances",
    "these localized structures are stable , there are situations in which they develop different kinds of instabilities .",
    "some instabilities lead to the formation of an extended pattern and therefore the localized character of the ds is destroyed .",
    "more interesting are the instabilities that , while preserving its localized character , induce the ds to start moving , breathing or oscillating @xcite .",
    "since ds can be considered as an entity on their own , these instabilities may lead to dynamical regimes that appear not to be present in the dynamical behavior of the extended system . in this context",
    "it has recently been reported that ds arising in a prototype model for optical cavities filled with a nonlinear kerr media may show excitable behavior , while locally the system is not excitable @xcite .",
    "thus , excitability can be an emergent property arising from the spatial dependence , which allows for the formation of localized structures .",
    "in that situation excitability is mediated by a saddle - loop bifurcation and the whole scenario is organized by a takens - bogdanov ( tb ) codimension-2 point . in parameter space",
    "the tb point is located in the asymptotic limit in which the model becomes equivalent to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "since this excitability scenario is an emergent property of the spatial dependence of the system , it is particularly important to characterize how this scenario may change when the nature of spatial coupling is varied . in the lugiato - lefever model",

    ", we consider an extension of the model , including a mildly nonlocal term which extends the range of spatial interaction @xcite .",
    "this extension of the original kerr model is suggested by the recent availability of metamaterials , allowing to design an optical kerr cavity where layers of right- and left - materials are alternated .",
    "this provides the possibility to strongly decrease the diffraction strength in the resonator , such that higher order spatial effects ( e.g. nonlocal effects ) start to dominate the dynamical behavior of the ds . in this work",
    ", it will be shown that the additional spatial interaction term is able to shift the bifurcation lines such that now two takens - bogdanov points move from infinity to finite parameter values , acting as organizing centers of a richer dynamical behavior .",
    "we consider an optical cavity with a kerr - type nonlinearity , driven by a homogeneous , coherent optical light beam .",
    "this system was first introduced by lugiato and lefever to study pattern formation in a driven nonlinear , passive optical resonator @xcite . in this work , we will study a more general equation , which includes a bilaplacian term : @xmath1 this model equation has been obtained in ref .",
