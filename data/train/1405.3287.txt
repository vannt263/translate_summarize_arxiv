    "probing the universality of the stellar initial mass function ( imf , i.e. , the distribution of the masses of stars at their birth ) , is one of the most challenging issues in modern astrophysics .",
    "the shape of the imf and its potential dependence on the environment are crucial to almost all branches of modern astrophysics ranging from planetary science , the evolution of stellar clusters , the dynamics and chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium , and galactic evolution .",
    "one of the first attempts to determine the shape of the imf was made by salpeter ( 1955 ) who derived the mass function of nearby galactic field stars of masses @xmath2 and found that it is well described by a power law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of stars between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and with @xmath7 .",
    "miller & scalo ( 1979 ) constructed the mass function of stars in the solar neighborhood and fitted it with a log - normal function with a steeper - than salpeter slope in the high mass regime ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "they also extended the imf to the low mass regime and found the numbers of solar and sub - solar mass stars to fall below the expectations of the extrapolated salpeter mass function .",
    "scalo ( 1986 ) combined galactic field stars with ob associations and obtained a mass function which is also steeper than the salpeter mass function ( i.e , @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 m@xmath10 ( see also rana 1987 ) .",
    "a three component power - law fit of the galactic field mass function has been proposed by kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , scalo ( 1998 ) and kroupa ( 2001,2002 ) whereas chabrier ( 2003 ) suggested that the galactic field stellar mass function can be fitted by a lognormal distribution for masses @xmath11 m@xmath12 and by the salpeter mass function for @xmath13 m@xmath12 .",
    "bochanski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) constructed the mass function of 15 million low - mass stars ( @xmath14 ) and suggested it can be well represented by a log - normal function which peaks at @xmath15 m@xmath10 .",
    "hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and more recently parravano et al .",
    "( 2011 ) proposed that the galactic field mass function is well described by a single functional form across the entire range of stellar masses which is a rosin - rammler function tapered by a salpeter - like power - law .",
    "other authors have proposed other functional forms such as the product of a power law and an exponential function ( larson 1998 ) , and an order-3 logistic function ( maschberger 2013 ) .",
    "the mass function of stars that can be counted in the field of the galaxy includes stars with a wide spread in age , that have various metallicities , and that were formed in regions of potentially differing properties .",
    "in contrast , stars in clusters have roughly the same age , metallicity , and are located at the same distance .",
    "thus , one can presume that their observed present day mass functions ( pdmfs ) are a fair representation of their imfs especially in the case of young clusters in which the effects of stellar and dynamical evolution are minimal .",

    "the derivation of the shape of the pdmf in these studies relied on constructing the histogram of stellar masses ( or of their logarithmic values ) in bins of equal sizes and then fitting it with one or several functional forms .",

    "is not without problems .",
    "one major issue is the dependence of the derived slopes on the size of the bin , particularly when dealing with low number statistics ( maz apellniz & beda 2005 ) .",
    "maz apellniz & beda ( 2005 ) also showed that the use of uniform size bins in mass or the logarithm of the mass can bias the determination of the slope of the imf when using a @xmath18 minimization of the binned data .",
    "the origin of the bias lies in the correlation between the number of stars per bin and the weights assigned to each bin .",
    "they showed that these biases can be reduced by using bins of variable sizes which contain equal numbers of stars .",
    "however , a potential danger of this method is to smooth features in the imf ( e.g. , bumps of physical origin ) by forcing stars to be distributed in bins containing equal numbers of stars .",
    "another important limitation of fitting binned mass functions is the undesired effect of the subjective choice of break points ( i.e. , the points where the mass functions turns from one power law / functional form to another ) . in this work",
    ", we use a bayesian statistics approach to infer the parameters that characterize the shape of the pdmf / imf for a number of young stellar clusters when the underlying imf is assumed to be described by the tapered power law function , a lognormal function at low masses coupled to a power law function at higher masses , and a three - component power law function .",

    "this is expected since the inclusion of the imf as a prior on measured masses tends to shift the most likely masses of each star to lower masses in this mass regime whereas the effect is negligible for masses near the peak of the imf ( i.e. , see fig .  [ fig19 ] ) .",

    "their inferred ppdf of the slope of the power - law shows a greater sensitivity to the completeness correction in terms of the position of the most likely value . however , they show that as long as conservative estimates of the completeness correction function are considered ( i.e. , a step function above which the data is assumed to be @xmath217 complete and below which the data is discarded ) , the inferred ppdfs of the power - low slope peaks at the same position as the one with which the mock data was produced .",
    "our results here clearly point in the same direction as theirs .",
    "if including the completeness correction leads to an entirely complete sample , then the inferred slope of the mass function at the intermediate- to high mass regime reflects it true value .",
    "the debate over the shape of the imf , its universality or potential variation among stellar clusters , as well as the similarity between the imf in stellar clusters and the field stars imf has been ongoing ever since salpeter ( 1955 ) published his findings , and is perhaps approaching the level of myth ( melnick 2009 ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to review all star cluster formation models .",
    "it is important however to mention that from a purely theoretical point of view much of the arguments in favor / disfavor of variations of the imf originate from the inclusion / absence in the models of the necessary physical processes that can lead to a significant degree of variations .",
    "a perfect illustration of this are the contrasting conclusions made by dib et al ( 2010 ) and hennebelle ( 2012 ) .",

    "( 2010 ) showed that the accretion of gas by protostellar cores can lead to variations in the core mass function ( and hence of the imf ) when environmental conditions vary from clump - to - clump ( i.e. , for example when cores of the same mass have different lifetimes and accretion timescales in different environments ) . on the other hand , in the model of hennebelle ( 2012 )",
    ", the accretion of gas by the clump from the larger scale environment is only expected to change the thermodynamical properties of the gas out of which newer generations of stars can form in the clump . as found by hennebelle ( 2012 ) and earlier pointed out by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the characteristic mass of the imf has an extremely weak dependence on the thermodynamical conditions out of which star form .",
    "the absence of accretion by the cores leaves the slopes at the high mass end and in the low mass regime unaffected .    on the observational side ,",
    "massey ( 2011 ) pointed out that much of the cluster - to - cluster variations can be due to the absence of spectroscopic measurements , the use of different reddening corrections , and different theoretical evolutionary tracks to convert luminosities into masses .",
    "he illustrated this by discussing the case of the ob association lh 58 in the lmc .",
    "for lh 58 , garmany et al .",

    "the case of the taurus cluster is often cited as a potential example whose mass function deviates from the field - like imfs ( luhman et 2000,2004a ) .",
    "goodwin et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that the observed deficit of low mass stars and brown dwarfs in taurus is due to the ejection of low mass cores by dynamical interaction while dib et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and dib ( 2012 ) showed that a taurus - like mass function can be reproduced when protostellar cores continue to accrete over longer timescales ( i.e. , as a result of being supported by comparatively stronger magnetic fields ) , and thus depleting the population of very low mass cores and shifting the peak of the mass function towards higher masses .",

    "2006 ; espinoza et al .",
    "2009 , hu@xmath222mann et al .",
    "2012 ) have also reported that the slope of the imf at the high mass end of starburst clusters such as the arches cluster , ngc 3603 , and the quintuplet cluster might be shallower than the salpeter value , albeit in the particular case of the arches clusters , newer measurements have brought back the slope to a more agreeable degree with the salpeter value ( espinoza et al .",

    "dib et al .",
    "( 2007,2008 ) and dib ( 2007 ) proposed that shallower - than salpeter slopes can result from the efficient coalescence of closely packed protostellar cores in a dense protocluster environment .",

    "in this work , we have presented the first analysis of the universality of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) using bayesian statistics with a monte carlo markov chain method for a sample of eight young galactic stellar clusters ( ic 348 , onc , ngc 2024 , ngc 6611 , ngc 2264 , @xmath0 ophiuchi , chameleon i , and taurus ) .",
    "those eight clusters were chosen based on the availability of their measured individual stellar masses . with the exception of the onc , individual masses where derived using the same theoretical evolutionary tracks , at least in the low mass end regime .",
    "we derive the posterior probability distributions ( ppdfs ) of the parameters that describe the imf all the way from the brown dwarfs and low mass regime up to the regime of massive stars .",
    "for each of the considered clusters , we infer the ppdf of the imf parameters when the likelihood function that describes the imf is given by a tapered power law function ( de marchi et al . 2010 ; parravano et al .",
    "2012 ) , a lognormal distribution at low masses coupled to a power law at higher masses ( chabrier 2005 ) , and a multi - component power law function ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "the tapered power function has three parameters which are the slopes of the mass function at the low and intermediate- to high mass regimes ( @xmath86 and @xmath84 , respectively ) and the characteristic mass @xmath85 .",
    "the lognormal - power low function is described by four parameters which are the width of the lognormal distribution and its characteristic mass ( @xmath108 and @xmath107 , respectively ) , the slope of the power law component , @xmath106 , and the position of the break point between the lognormal and power law parts of the mass function , @xmath109 .",
    "the three - component mass function has five parameters which are the three slopes of the power law components ( @xmath223 , @xmath112 ) and the two break points that mark the transition from one power law to another .",
    "the inter - cluster comparison of the inferred 1d ppdfs as well as the 2d surface density probabilities of the parameters with the different likelihood functions ( @xmath224 ; [ @xmath225 , [ @xmath226 ) shows that these distributions do not overlap within the @xmath1 uncertainty level ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , and fig .",

    "when the likelihood function is the tapered power law mass function , the most likely values of @xmath86 span the range @xmath227 @xmath228 to @xmath229 with ngc 2024 and the onc possessing these two extreme values , respectively .",
    "the ppdfs of @xmath84 also show variations over a significant range going from @xmath230 for @xmath0 oph , ic 348 , and cha i , and up to @xmath231 for taurus and its most massive counterpart ngc 6611 .",
    "variations in the most likely value of the inferred ppdfs for @xmath85 also span a significant range from @xmath232 m@xmath10 for the onc and ic 348 and up to @xmath233 m@xmath10 for taurus and ngc 6611 .",
    "the inferred ppdf of @xmath85 which peaks at a much higher value of @xmath234 m@xmath10 should not be considered very seriously since the current census of stars for ngc 2024 and which we used in this work contains only low mass stars with a maximum mass of @xmath235 m@xmath10 .",
    "similar variations are observed when the likelihood functions that describes the imf is chosen to be the lognormal+power law function ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) or the multi - component power law function ( fig .  [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the most probable values of the imf parameters for most of these clusters deviate substantially from their values for the galactic field stars imf .    we have explored the effects of mass incompleteness on the inferred ppdfs of the imf parameters .",
    "the completeness correction whether performed using a star - to - star completeness probability ( available only for the onc ) , or by imposing a cutoff mass at the low mass end above which the mass function is assumed to be complete ( i.e. , for the remaining seven clusters ) affects essentially the inferred ppdfs of the slope of the mass function at the low mass end ( i.e. , compare the ppdfs of @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] with those in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] and fig .  [ fig18 ] ) .",
    "we have also measured the effect on the inferred ppdfs of taking into account the uncertainties on the measured masses which we model as lognormal distributions .",
    "we also chose the imf itself ( at each iteration in the mcmc chain ) as a prior on the measured masses .",
    "this is performed here only for the case of the onc for which such uncertainties are available .",
    "our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] ) show that the inclusion of the mass uncertainties shifts the ppdf of the slope at the intermediate- to high mass end @xmath84 to higher masses , leaving the ppdfs of @xmath86 and @xmath85 unaffected .",
    "this is expected due to the combined effect that uncertainties on the stellar masses are higher for higher mass stars and the fact that the mass function has a negative slope in the high mass regime .",
    "the results presented in this paper highlight the importance of using advanced and robust statistical methods for the inference of the parameters that characterize the stellar initial mass function .",
    "we find that all of the three imf functional forms are able to reproduce the observations if the parameters that define each function are allowed to vary significantly ( i.e. , beyond the @xmath1 limit ) .",
    "however , it is not clear which one of these three functions , if any , captures the physics of the star formation process . in this work ,",
    "we have inferred the parameters that strictly describe the `` shape '' of the imf .",
    "additional parameters can be included such as the mass of the cluster ( see e.g. , cervio et al .",
    "2013 ) maximum stellar mass present in the cluster in the framework of a cluster mass - maximum stellar mass relation .",
    "since we are dealing here with only eight clusters with a small range in cluster masses , the significance of including @xmath236 as a free parameter in this study is rather limited . in this work ,",
    "we have used rather simple prior functions on the parameters ( i.e. , rectangular functions ) , thus assuming implicitly that we have little knowledge on their parameters from theory and or theoretical models of star formation .",
    "at least for the eight clusters considered in this work , the posterior probability distribution functions derived for their parameters can serve as prior functions when using improved data from future surveys .",
