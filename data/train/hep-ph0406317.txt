    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the promising candidates of the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "no signature of susy has been found yet . however , the discovery of the susy particles is guaranteed for @xmath8 tev at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) for the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model . date taking is expected to start from 2007 .",
    "masses of the sparticles will also be measured at the lhc @xcite with reasonable accuracy , which is important to distinguish various susy breaking models .",
    "the lagrangian of supersymmetric theory is highly constrained .",
    "for example the sfermion - fermion - gaugino interaction is restricted to be of the form @xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath11 because @xmath12 and @xmath13 belong to the same chiral multiplet in supersymmetry . on the other hand , @xmath14 and @xmath15 mixing terms",
    "are controlled by the @xmath16 term of the superpotential of the form @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the mixing term is proportional to the yukawa coupling @xmath18 and @xmath6 parameter .",
    "studying such mixing terms determined by the supersymmetry would be an interesting target for collider physics after the discovery of the supersymmetry .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of the neutralino polarization in the decay chain @xmath19 here @xmath20 denotes the lepton from @xmath21 decay . due to the chirality structure of the squark - quark - neutralino coupling , the @xmath22",
    "is polarized .",
    "the polarization of @xmath22 then affects the angular distribution of the slepton in the @xmath23 decay .",
    "the polarization dependence of the angular distribution eventually shows up in the charge asymmetry in the @xmath24 distribution , because the polarization dependent part of the amplitude flips under the charge conjugation transformation .",
    "the effect can be seen at the @xmath25 collider lhc because the number of squarks @xmath26 produced at the lhc is larger than @xmath27 .",
