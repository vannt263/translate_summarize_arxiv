    "in 2008 , the crisis in credit markets led to a spike in correlations that resulted in large losses for several single - stock exotic trading books .",
    "as most market participants did not anticipate the crises , one is tempted to also put these equity losses under the category of unpredictable and unforeseen  bad \" events .",
    "we do not fully subscribe to this view . in this paper",
    "we argue that , at least to some extent , the losses could have been alleviated if models had incorporated non - trivial correlation information , already encoded in the index option market , properly into the pricing of multi - asset derivatives .",
    "this is because the index volatility market already implies rising correlations in downturn scenarios .",
    "most investment banks utilise a gaussian copula for the pricing of multi - asset exotic european payoffs . for more involved payoffs",
    "a multi - asset version of dupire s local volatility model has become the market standard for the pricing and hedging of those products .",
    "the model infers a local spot - dependent volatility surface from option prices for each asset and combines them via a ( constant ) correlation matrix between its wiener increments .",
    "however even when correlations are assumed time - dependent , the model does not incorporate all dependency information inherent in the derivatives market properly .",
    "in particular with downward scenarios , index options imply correlations that can be substantially higher compared to the  at - the - money \" case . as a result",
    "the cost of short cross - gamma position hedging could be priced in advance , more appropriately , by means of a better model .    in chapter 2 of this paper",
    "we take a snapshot of the options market and deduce the distribution of the dow jones euro stoxx 50 ( .stoxx50e ) and dax ( .gdaxi ) indices together with all the composite distributions . in both cases",
    "we show that only half of the volatility skew of the index is explained by the skew of the index constituents .",
    "we conclude that ( term ) correlation effectively depends on the strike of the option which substantially impacts the distribution of the index on the downside .",
    "it is important that multi - asset derivative models incorporate these effects even if a product is only sensitive to a subset of stocks in the index .",
    "this is because the picture remains fundamentally the same : stocks correlate more strongly in a bear market , when investment behaviour is driven by fear , than during bullish times . as a result portfolio managers may find themselves less diversified , even when the composition of their portfolio stays the same .",
    "as far as hedging of derivatives is concerned , an increase in correlations has the unpleasant effect of increasing the cost of managing short cross - gamma positions .",
    "this arises as a result of the non - linear behaviour of ( multi - asset ) options prices and manifests itself in the fact that the option s sensitivity to one asset increases with the value of a second decreasing . during the credit crunch for example ,",
    "the nikkei often finished down for the day creating a long delta position in eurostoxx 50 for a hedging book in london , even though the market there was closed .",
    "as a result , the trader would need to immediately sell eurostoxx 50 at the open .",
    "however eurostoxx 50 would be likely to open down as well because of the large positive correlation between the two assets .",
    "this gives rise to systematic losses during periods when the correlation exceeds expectations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a model that incorporates higher correlations in downward scenarios by  decoding \" the state - dependent correlation information of the index option market .",
    "one expects that such a model anticipates losses such as those described above at the inception of the trade and adjusts the pricing accordingly .",
    "in addition one would expect more accurate deltas in this case .    in order to make lcm a model that can be useful for practical applications",
    ", one needs to provide a robust as well as efficient implementation for the underlying algorithms .",
    "this is the strenght of dupire s local volatility model which is simple to implement , numerically sufficiently efficient and provides consistency with the volatility skew of individual option markets at the same time .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend this methodology to the multi - asset case by providing consistency with the index option market in addition to the individual option markets .",
    "note that , similar to the dupire framework , lcm provides a particular way of achieving consistency with the option markets , however this solution is by no means unique .",
    "chapter 7 provides alternative solutions to the same problem which allows one to quantify `` residual exotic correlation risk''.    work in this direction has also been pursued by others .",
    "see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "chapter 3 lays down the ground work for the  local correlation \" model ( lcm ) that is introduced in chapter 4 .",
    "a parameterisation of correlations is introduced that preserves the positive semi - definiteness and displays some notion of strictly increasing correlation matrices .",
    "chapter 5 provides simulation results of lcm and provides explicit results for the strike dependence of correlation .",
    "chapter 6 deals with some implementation details and chapter 7 discusses residual correlation risk . chapter 8 concudes our analysis .",
    "in this chapter we take a snapshot of the market as of 31 july 2009 and try to explain the observed index option prices of eurostoxx 50 and dax in terms of their constituent distributions .",
    "one finds that the skewness of the individual distributions fails to fully explain the volatility skew of the index basket itself .",
    "hence , the index volatility market encodes non - trivial dependencies between its constituents .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the value of the index at time @xmath1 .",
    "the price of a call option on the index with maturity @xmath1 and strike @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 .",
    "note that    @xmath4    where df is the discount factor to maturity and @xmath5 denotes the expectation value under the forward adjusted measure @xmath6 .",
    "thus , eq.[form : rnpricing ] relates option prices to the ( forward - adjusted ) implied density @xmath7 that is inferred by the option market with maturity t. assume that for a given maturity t all strikes are traded .",
    "in this case eq.[form : rnpricing ] can easily be inverted with the result @xmath8 let us denote by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the price of constituent @xmath11 at time @xmath1 .",
    "the index is generally defined as a weighted sum of its constituents e.g. @xmath12    examples for basket weights are given in table 1 .",
    "for the dax the weights are listed in table 2 .",
    "[ decomp ]    .decomposition of eurostoxx 50 on the 31 july 2009 .",
    "the first column displays the ( reuters ) names of the assets followed by the weight in the index . [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also computed the average correlation which comes out roughly the same in both cases . henceforth despite the fact that all individual as well as basket distributions are the same",
    ", the value of worst - of puts substantially differ between the two sets . in a sense basket options",
    "are mainly sensitive to overall shifts of the correlation matrix only and hence to the first principal component of the correlation matrix itself .",
    "this is different for worst(best)- of call and put options which show significant sensitivity to  higher \" vibrations such as chewing - gum moves representing higher principal components of the correlation matrix .",
    "this is why liquid prices for worst(best)-of options would be very useful in providing further important clues about the joint dynamics of the system . in other words ,",
    "the volatility skew for the basket can provide only little insight into the pricing of the worst - of ( best - of ) options , particularly when the number of basket members is large .",
    "this makes them ideal candidates to augment the correlation information provided by the basket .",
    "in this paper we show that the index option s market is inconsistent with the option market of the individual constituents if the dependency between the assets was to be described by a deterministic correlation matrix only or by a gaussian copula .",
    "the data strongly suggests higher correlations on the downside and gives rise to a correlation skew which is computed explicitly in this paper .",
    "roughly only half of the skew of the index can be attributed to the skew of the individual components , indicating that state - dependent correlation dynamics could play a crucial role in explaining the distribution of the index .",
    "this paper generalizes dupire s local volatility model to the multi - asset case in a numerically efficient way and provides consistency not only with the individual option s markets but also with the volatility market of the index itself by making correlations a dynamic variable .",
    "we also discuss the non - uniqueness of the solution and introduce the `` chewing - gum '' effect in this context where single stocks move against each other while leaving the distribution of the basket as well as all individual distributions unchanged .",
    "however worst - of options show price sensitivity in such moves which makes them ideal candidates to further ",
    "complete \" the market and augment our knowledge of the joint dynamics of the system .",
    "in the first step consider @xmath13 separate economies @xmath14 for @xmath15 each one consisting of a deterministic bond @xmath16 together with @xmath17 , e.g. @xmath18 . because of the specific form of eq.[lognorm ] , that is the fact that volatility depends on the spot only , each @xmath14 is complete .",
    "the existence of an equivalent martingale measure states that the dividend - adjusted processes @xmath19 are martingales under the cash numeraire @xmath20 yielding eq.[arb ] @xcite .",
    "the specific form of eq.[arb1 ] has been derived in the literature already ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however this paper ignores drift terms . in several instances eq.[arb1 ] has been published incorrectly . the second term in the numerator @xmath21 is mistakenly replaced by @xmath22 .",
    "we quickly re - derive this equation at the end of this appendix . in the second step one",
    "considers the economy @xmath23 that trades the option market specified in eq.[optionmkt ] . in order to avoid ",
    "spot \" arbitrage between the index and its components taking appropriate @xmath24 )  expectation values on both sides of eq.[basketdef ] immediately yields eq.[thm : multidupire ] .",
    "one is left to show that eq.[arb3 ] avoids dispersion arbitrage between the basket option market and the individual option markets .",
    "this is done in chapter [ chap : lcm ] .",
    "re - derivation of dupire s formula :    if one defines    @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the application of tanaka s formula yields @xmath27    stochastic integration on both sides with subsequent expectation taking yields :    @xmath28+\\frac{1}{2 } k^2 e[\\delta(s_t - k ) \\sigma_t^2]-r_t e[s_t - k)^+]\\right)}\\ ] ] differentiation on both sides with respect to t gives : @xmath29+\\frac{1}{2 } k^2 e[\\delta(s_t - k ) \\sigma_t^2]-r_t e[s_t - k)^+]\\right)\\ ] ]    note that plain vanilla options obey    @xmath30-k e[1_{s_t >",

    "similarly the expectation of the dirac delta function can be inferred from option prices according to @xmath32 = \\frac{\\partial^2 c_0(t , k)}{\\partial^2 k } $ ] .",
    "if one inserts this back into the above equation and uses the fact that @xmath33 =   e[\\delta(s_t - k ) ] e[\\sigma_t^2 \\|s_t = k]\\ ] ] this yields eq.[arb1 ] , as for a state - dependent local vol the expectation drops , e.g. @xmath34=\\sigma_t^2(s_t = k ) $ ]",
