    "their contributions to radiative corrections were studied in detail in  @xcite . according to fig .  2 from that paper it is clear that the contributions of mssm higgses ( and @xmath54 gauge bosons ) equal with very good accuracy those of the standard model with the mass of sm higgs being equal to that of the lightest neutral higgs in susy generalization .",
    "that is why the contributions from the gauge - higgs sector of the theory also can not compensate those of the light chargino - neutralino .",
