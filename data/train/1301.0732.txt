    "we extend the results of @xcite to the case of a lattice scheme , i.e. when the lattice is not a priory given but it is defined by an equation so as to be able to perform a symmetry preserving discretization of the pde .    in section 2 we prove a theorem characterizing the symmetries of linear difference schemes on four lattice points and in section 3 we apply it to find conditions under which a nonlinear difference scheme is linearizable .",
