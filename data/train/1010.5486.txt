    "but in order to do so we will need first to delve into the language of partitions of integers .",
    "luckily for us , the description of all solutions to the generalized bachet problem is surprisingly elegant and simple when phrased in terms of _ partitions of integers_. a _ partition _ of a positive integer @xmath5 is an ordered sequence of positive integers that sum to @xmath5 : @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",

    "analogous to the hand - shaking lemma in graph theory , the first lemma that everyone encounters in integer partitions is : the number of partitions of a given @xmath5 with no parts larger than @xmath19 equals the number of partitions of @xmath5 with at most @xmath19 parts . for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "this translates to @xmath58 .",

    ".    returning to bachet s problem , let s call a partition of @xmath5 a _ bachet partition _ if    \\(1 ) every integer @xmath23 can be written as @xmath59 where each @xmath60    and ( 2 ) there does not exist another partition of @xmath5 satisfying ( 1 ) with fewer parts than @xmath19 .",

    "the equivalence of conditions ( 1 ) & ( 1)@xmath67 , as essentially noted by hardy & wright in @xcite , is given by the shift of @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "note that we could just as easily have replaced @xmath23 in ( 1 ) with @xmath73 since , thinking in terms of the two scales , a negative @xmath38 would have the weights on the scales interchanged from that of the positive @xmath22 .",
    "partitions of an integer @xmath5 satisfying ( 1)@xmath67 are called _ @xmath74-complete partitions _ and were introduced by park @xcite as recently as 1998 .",
    "this shift between conditions ( 1 ) and ( 1)@xmath67 is little more than a sleight of hand but it does resolve the central difficulty in dealing with ( 1 ) , in that it avoids having to deal with both addition & subtraction operations , whereas ( 1)@xmath67 involves only addition .",

    "a simple equivalence regarding the @xmath74-complete partitions , first proved by park , will amazingly tell us all that we need to know about bachet partitions . we ll deal first with the minimality condition ( 2 ) .",

    "@xmath89 and the corollary now follows by an inductive argument .",
    "now we come to the minimality condition of bachet partitions . corollary  [ cor:3s ] implies that if @xmath71 is a bachet partition then the sum of the parts in the partition can not exceed @xmath90 .",

    "so if we could find a partition satisfying condition ( 1 ) with exactly @xmath98 parts then @xmath98 must be precisely the number of parts needed for a bachet partition of @xmath5 .",

    "* lemma 3.2 ) where bachet partitions are called _",
    "minimal 2-complete partitions_. one might wonder next : are the bachet partitions from proposition  [ pro : first ] the only bachet partitions for each positive integer @xmath5  ? in the case of @xmath47 it is now easy to show that the answer is yes . to see this",
    "let @xmath102 be a bachet partition .",
    "if any of the @xmath103 s were strictly less than @xmath104 then , from corollary  [ cor:3s ] , we would have @xmath105 which can not occur .",
    "hence , as claimed by @xcite , @xmath106 is the unique bachet partition for @xmath47 .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that a partition is a bachet partition if and only if it both has the number of parts as stated above and , amazingly , the conclusion of lemma  [ lem : suff ] is satisfied for all parts in the partition .",
    "but before doing so permit us to digress a little and say what was so enjoyable about this section : we discovered everything we needed to know about the number of parts needed for a bachet partition by starting with a very simple collection of inequalities ( lemma  [ lem : suff ] ) and then we used a very generous version of these inequalities to attain @xmath86 .",
    "when combined with proposition  [ pro : first ] we were able to solve the problem of the number of weights needed for the bachet problem .",
    "while not containing content that is anywhere near as substantial , this `` generous use '' of inequalities reminds us of one of the reasons why euler s proof that there are infinitely many primes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.1 , 4@xmath0 proof ) is many a person s favorite : euler seems to throw out everything but the kitchen sink with every relaxed inequality made but he still ends up capturing a very sharp picture . with such languid inequalities , he shows that the number of primes less than a real number @xmath95 is bounded below by @xmath107 which was the first prophecy of the prime number theorem on how primes are distributed asymptotically .",
    "we should know better but it is still surprising to attain meaningful , sharp results from languid inequalities such as those used in this section .",
    "see @xcite for a delightful , analysis - flavored account on all things being `` inequal '' !",
    "recall our example of @xmath101 as a bachet partition .",
    "in contrast to the scenario where @xmath108 is a unique bachet partition for that particular @xmath5 , there are many ( many being nine ! ) bachet partitions for @xmath6 : @xmath8 that these partitions are precisely the bachet partitions for @xmath7 follow from this remarkable result :    [ thm : necc ] the partition @xmath50 is a bachet partition if and only if @xmath109 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for every @xmath77 .",
    "due to lemma  [ lem : suff ] and theorem  [ thm : min ] all we need show is that if @xmath76 for every @xmath77 then @xmath50 is a @xmath74-complete partition .",
    "this will be carried out by induction on the number of parts in the partition .",
    "let @xmath110 be the set of all partitions with @xmath19 parts that satisfy @xmath75 and @xmath76 for every @xmath77 .",
    "we will show that @xmath110 is contained in the set of @xmath74-complete partitions .",
    "clearly this is true for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "assume it is so for all @xmath113 s where @xmath114 .",
    "we will show that @xmath110 is contained in the set of @xmath74-complete partitions .",
    "let @xmath115 be a fixed partition in @xmath110 .",
    "note that this implies that @xmath116 is in @xmath117 and so our inductive hypothesis tells us the following : every integer @xmath22 less than or equal to @xmath118 can be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath120 .",
    "so we can assume from here that we fix @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in this case there will always exist an @xmath123 such that @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "but since @xmath126 our inductive hypothesis tells us that @xmath127 can be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath120 and so @xmath22 can be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath22 be any positive integer no larger than @xmath129 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath22 can be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath22 equals @xmath100 or @xmath131 then there is nothing to show .",
    "otherwise either @xmath132 , or @xmath133 , or @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath132 then since @xmath115 is in @xmath110 we have @xmath135 which implies that @xmath136 and from our inductive hypothesis as observed above @xmath22 can then be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath120 .    if @xmath133 then @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "just as in the @xmath132 case , our inductive hypothesis guarantees that @xmath139 can then be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath120 and so @xmath22 can then be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath128 .    finally , it is assumed that @xmath140 and so if @xmath141 we then have @xmath142 and so , just as in the cases above , @xmath22 can then be written as a @xmath119-combination of @xmath128 .",
    "one striking aspect of this inequality formulation of the bachet partitions is that for each positive @xmath5 we can think of the bachet partitions as the set of lattice points ( points all of whose entries are integers ) in the polyhedron in @xmath143 defined by the inequalities of theorem  [ thm : necc ] .",
    "the nine bachet partitions of @xmath7 , written as @xmath144 , sit in the ( two - dimensional ) plane living in @xmath145 cut out by the equations @xmath146 and @xmath147 and by the six additional _ halfspaces _ defined by the six inequalities : @xmath148 for each @xmath149 and @xmath150 . by _",
    "cut out _ we really mean the region in @xmath145 given by the intersection of the two three - dimensional planes and the six halfspaces :    the first three inequalities ( along with the two - dimensional plane ) cut out the shaded triangle shown . in this case of @xmath6 , the other three inequalities that define the ordering of the parts of the partitions are not needed ",
    "they are said to be _ redundant _  as they do not contribute to the _ cutting out _ of the shaded triangle .",
    "the bachet partitions of @xmath7 , as expected from theorem  [ thm : necc ] , are precisely the integer points in the shaded region .",
    "another striking consequence of the inequality formulation is that every bachet partition has an _ hereditary property _",
    ": it can be both projected down to , and lifted up from , another bachet partition . in the next sections we ll use this hereditary property to count the number of bachet partitions for a given @xmath5 but in order to do so we must first talk about ternary partitions and generating functions .",

    "there is a formula due to rdseth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) for counting precisely the number of distinct bachet partitions for a given @xmath5 .",
    "it is a _ generating function _ formula and a quick perusal of the encyclopedic @xcite should convince the reader that generating functions are _ the _ standard way of counting in the theory of partitions of integers .",
    "however , the full derivation @xcite of rdseth s formula is difficult and technical and is beyond the scope ( and against the informal spirit ) of this present article .",
    "but we will describe rdseth s formula nonetheless and justify it for a substantial number of cases . to describe it",
    "we ll first need to talk about _ ternary partitions _ and their generating function .",
    "recall that we can formally write the geometric series @xmath151 as @xmath152 .",
    "we define the generating function @xmath153 where @xmath154 is understood as the coefficient of @xmath155 in the infinite product @xmath156 the significance of the term _ generating function _ comes from each @xmath154 counting the @xmath157 instance of some combinatorial phenomenon ; in this case , the number of partitions of @xmath158 into powers of @xmath4 ( these are called _ ternary partitions _ ) . for example , @xmath159 since there are precisely nine partitions of @xmath160 all of whose parts are powers of @xmath4 :    @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "a contribution of `` @xmath10 '' is made to the coefficient @xmath159 for each ternary partition of @xmath160 .",
    "one such contribution would be given by the term @xmath170 which represents the ternary partition @xmath171 of three @xmath10 s and four @xmath4 s . by convention , @xmath172 .",
    "the generating function @xmath173 also satisfies the functional equation @xmath174 or , @xmath175 and looking at the coefficient of @xmath176 in this equation we attain a recurrence relation @xmath177 or @xmath178 returning to our ternary partitions this recurrence should not be so surprising : it says that the ternary partitions of @xmath179 can be made from those of @xmath180 ( all of these already contain at least two @xmath10 s as parts and so adding another part equal to @xmath10 gives all possible ternary partitions of @xmath179 with some parts equal to @xmath10 ) and from those ternary partitions of @xmath158 ( by multiplying all terms of these ternary partitions of @xmath158 by @xmath4 we get ternary partions of @xmath179 with no parts equal to @xmath10 ) .",
    "the recurrence relation @xmath181 explains this manner of counting the ternary partitions of @xmath179 in a concise and unfussy manner .    in other words ,",
    "the generating function @xmath173 is not only an accounting mechanism for ternary partitions but we can also manipulate the properties of @xmath173 to recover encoded information about the ternary partitions themselves .",
    "these are some of the reasons that generating function formulae are thought of as the most useful means of counting not only specific partitions of integers but other combinatorial phenomena .",
    "a wonderfully colorful yet precise introduction to generating functions in general is @xcite and @xcite introduces them in the context of partitions of integers .",
    "returning again to our recurrence relations for the ternary partitions , we can observe that that @xmath182 since the ternary partitions of @xmath183 and @xmath184 are those given by adding one and two extra parts equal to @xmath10 respectively to those of @xmath179 .",
    "we can thus generalize the recurrence relation @xmath181 to @xmath185 . by the same recurrence we have @xmath186 and repeating we have @xmath187 with the initial condition of @xmath172 . as we would expect , this recurrence yields @xmath188 and so @xmath189 which yields @xmath190 as claimed from the generating function above .",
    "let us now explain the link between bachet partitions and ternary partitions . letting @xmath191 denote the set of bachet partitions of @xmath5 , rdseth s formula amounts to showing that @xmath192 for essentially two - thirds of all positive integers @xmath5 .",
    "for the other one - third , we will also describe what happens , in terms of counting lattice points in polyhedra .",
    "we begin with two observations .",
    "the first is that we get bachet partitions from @xmath193 by sequentially peeling off ( projecting down ) their largest parts : @xmath194 it s clear in this example that every peeling will project to a unique bachet partition and this _ hereditary property _ is true in general : if @xmath115 is a bachet partition then so is @xmath195 for every @xmath196 .",
    "the only tedious part of the proof of this claim is showing that @xmath197 .    secondly , reversing the projection we see that @xmath198 could lift to @xmath193 but could also lift to a bachet partition @xmath199 of @xmath200 . but",
    "what we can say is the following : if @xmath201 is a bachet partition of @xmath202 ( implicit in this statement is that @xmath203 ) then we can extend it to a bachet partition @xmath204 of a fixed @xmath5 if and only if    \\(i ) @xmath205 , ( ii ) @xmath5 has the property that @xmath109 + and ( iii ) @xmath206 or @xmath207 .    in the case of the bachet partitions for @xmath6 below ,",
    "the boldfaced largest terms are peeled off to leave precisely the bachet partitions for @xmath208 and @xmath209 and , by the projections of the hereditary property , no other bachet partitions can be built upon to provide bachet partitions for @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath210 in other words , @xmath211 we claim that @xmath212 holds whenever @xmath5 is sandwiched by @xmath213    let s refer to such @xmath5 s as simply being _",
    "sandwiched_. for sandwiched @xmath5 s , condition ( ii ) above is immediately taken care of .",
    "we already have @xmath214 and @xmath215 which implies that @xmath216 as needed for condition ( i ) . and in order that condition ( iii ) is met we need simply to insist that those bachet@xmath217 s that extend to bachet partitions of @xmath5 are exactly those in the range @xmath218 hence @xmath219    by the projecting and lifting of the hereditary property , each bachet partition of @xmath202 is extended to a _",
    "unique _ bachet partition of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the number of elements in the above union equals the sum of the number of elements in each @xmath220 of that union .",
    "so whenever @xmath5 is sandwiched we have @xmath221    we are now ready to tie together bachet partitions and ternary partitions .",
    "we claim that @xmath222 for all sandwiched @xmath5 s .",
    "we do so once again by induction on @xmath109 .",
    "the claim holds for @xmath223 since @xmath224 and also for all sandwiched @xmath5 s for @xmath225 , as can be seen here :    @xmath226    @xmath227    so assume that @xmath5 is sandwiched with @xmath109 .",
    "we already know that @xmath228 and we remark that every such @xmath202 in this summation is also sandwiched , but with @xmath203 .",
    "hence , by our inductive hypothesis , @xmath229 and @xmath230 but the input of the last term @xmath231 simplifies to @xmath232 and so we have @xmath233 this is exactly the recurrence relation , with the initial conditions still intact , that we had hoped to obtain .",
    "hence when @xmath5 is sandwiched , the generating function for the bachet partitions is exactly @xmath173 , the generating function for the ternary partitions .",
    "we close this section by describing what happens for those @xmath5 s that are not sandwiched . using the generating function @xmath173 we can define another @xmath234 then , adapting the convention that @xmath235 if @xmath158 is a negative integer , rdseth s formula claims that the number of bachet partitions of @xmath5 equals @xmath236 note that @xmath5 is sandwiched precisely when the input for @xmath237 is negative .",
    "an example of a non - sandwiched @xmath5 is @xmath238 and for this we have @xmath239 ( we only have to work out the first two parts",
    "@xmath240 of the infinite sum for @xmath241 ) .",
    "we can list the bachet partitions for @xmath238 , using theorem  [ thm : necc ] : @xmath242 sticking to our promise not to prove rdseth s formula we will instead present a polyhedral picture as to why the generating function @xmath243 is needed when @xmath5 is not sandwiched .",
    "in a previous section we saw a figure showing the bachet partitions for @xmath6 as lattice points in a triangle .",
    "a key observation here , and something that holds for all sandwiched @xmath5 s , is that the ordering inequalities @xmath244 were subsumed by the @xmath148 .",
    "this is a significant part of what made counting @xmath191 for sandwiched @xmath5 s relatively straightforward : we get the ordering of the parts for free from the other inequalities !",
    "not so when @xmath5 is not sandwiched and we can see this in the following figure for @xmath245 :    the @xmath246 points on the left indicate the lattice points in the polyhedron defined by @xmath247 and living in the plane defined by @xmath75 and @xmath248 .",
    "this polyhedron pays no regard to the ordering of the parts in the bachet partitions .",

    ". this would not be the usual approach in integer partitions owing to the fact that partitions can rarely be described in terms of lattice points in a polyhedron .",
    "many of the wonderful results in integer partitions depend largely on the ability to manipulate generating functions in much the same way that we attained the functional equation @xmath175 . however , it is no fluke that the generating functions above counted the lattice points and this method of counting lattice points in a polyhedron ( by generating functions ) is one of the most beautiful and effective methods for solving the general problem of counting lattice points in polyhedra .",

    "the full story of these variants can be found as follows : the description of the one - scale problem was first described by brown @xcite and extended to the @xmath275-partitions by park @xcite , who called them _ minimal @xmath253-complete partitions_. the one - scale problem was enumerated for sandwiched @xmath5 s by binary partitions in @xcite , and rdseth @xcite extended this enumeration for all minimal @xmath259-partitions .",

    "then @xmath71 is an @xmath254-partition if and only if @xmath279 holds for all @xmath271 .",
    "these problems are completely understood ( and proven ) in much the same manner as the two - scale problem where powers of @xmath4 are replaced with powers of @xmath74 . for posterity s sake ,",
    "let s briefly document the results here .",
    "we will generalize bachet s problem in a `` relaxed '' or `` error correcting '' manner .",
    "we consider the following variant of it :    here , we only need four parts and the partition @xmath280 will suffice .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that using the parts of @xmath280 we can weigh every integer between @xmath10 and @xmath281 on a two - scale pan , within an error of one .",
    "this leads us to the following definition .",
    "a partition @xmath71 with the parts in increasing order is an _",

    "in fact , the two parts of @xmath299 are sufficient for the job .",
    "if the weight @xmath22 placed on the right scale were equal to @xmath74 , @xmath300 , @xmath267 or @xmath297 then this would result in a balanced scale when @xmath74 , @xmath301 , @xmath267 or @xmath302 respectively are placed on the two - scale balance ( as before , positive coefficients are assigned to weights placed on the left scale , negative to those on the right ) .",

    "in 1886 major percy a. macmahon @xcite @xcite proposed and solved an alternative generalization to bachet s problem , which differs significantly from the generalization that we have investigated until now .",
    "it s appropriate too that we should include macmahon s contribution to bachet s problem since , as gian - carlo rota persuasively argues in his introduction to macmahon s collected papers @xcite , macmahon s substantial contributions to the foundation of modern combinatorics have not always been given their proper due .",

    "<S> bachet s problem needs no more than four weights and these ( unique ) pound weights are 1,3,9 and 27 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure @xcite displays how to weigh 20 ( steinhaus @xcite had the good sense to only lift ounce rather than pound weights onto the page ) and the table ( also from @xcite ) displays how to measure all the weights between 1 and 40 inclusive , a positive coefficient assigned to weights placed on the left scale , a negative to those on the right . </S>",
    "<S> writing the solution as an integer partition with four parts @xmath1 , bachet s problem s noble roots in _ fibonacci s liber abaci _ @xcite make it a viable candidate for the first problem of integer partitions .    until relatively recently the only known generalizations of this problem </S>",
    "<S> were that of replacing @xmath2 with integers of the form @xmath3 @xcite and the appropriate partition , as we might guess at this juncture , being powers of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this has received some practical attention in economics @xcite as it provides optimal denominations of coins and currency . however , a retort to this @xcite is that in our common decimal system not everyone can think quickly in ternary .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ generalized bachet s problem _ that we will explore here is that of finding appropriate weights when one replaces @xmath2 with any positive integer . </S>",
    "<S> the full generalization , due to park @xcite and studied further by rdseth @xcite , not only tells us the _ minimum number of parts _ needed when @xmath2 is replaced by any @xmath5 but _ all possible ways to accordingly break up _ a given @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can also _ count _ the number of distinct ways to break up such an @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when we replace @xmath2 by @xmath6 we ll still need no more than four parts but there are now nine ways to break up @xmath7 to solve bachet s problem . written as partitions with four parts , these are : @xmath8 remarkably , given the age and popularity of bachet s problem , these headways have come to light only in the last fifteen or so years and they seem to be little known at that . given its status as one of the first problems of partitions of integers , we aim to rectify this sad state of affairs and to do so in a lively and informal yet unambiguous fashion , using only our sharp wits and a willingness to induct ! </S>",
    "<S> we also hope to introduce impressionable readers to some of the wonders of partitions of integers , recurrence relations , generating functions and counting integer points in polyhedra .    </S>",
    "<S> we will also expound on similar problems like the following : _ what is the least number of pound weights that can be used on a scale pan to weigh any integral number of pounds from 1 to 15 inclusive , if the weights can be placed in only one of the scale pans  ? </S>",
    "<S> _ finally , we will close with macmahon s generalization of ( the two - scale ) bachet s problem : he noticed @xcite that @xmath9 can be used to _ </S>",
    "<S> uniquely _ weigh every integer weight between @xmath10 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the figure displays that @xmath11 and we claim , in the sense of bachet , that this is the only way to write @xmath12 using @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see what the factorization @xmath15 of @xmath16 has to do with the weight set @xmath9 for @xmath2 . </S>"
