    "the meson - photon and photon - meson transition form factors contain interesting physics concerning the qcd structure of both photons and mesons .",
    "the pion - photon transition form factor provides a very simple example for the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) analysis to exclusive processes , and was first analyzed by brodsky and lepage @xcite at large @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the applicability of pqcd can be extended to lower @xmath3 around a few @xmath5 by taking into the transverse momentum contributions in both hard scattering amplitude and pion wave function . in our recent study @xcite within light - cone quark model , it is shown that the pion - photon transition form factor is identical to the photon - pion transition form factor when taking into account only qcd and qed contributions .",
    "therefore the formalism that applies to the pion - photon transition form factor is also applicable to the photon - pion transition form factor .",
    "taking the minimal quark - antiquark fock states of both the photon and pion as their wave functions , we could calculate the photon - pion transition form factor by using the drell - yan - west assignment .",
    "this framework is applicable at low @xmath3 as a light - cone quark model approach , and it is also physically in accordance with the light - cone pqcd approach at large @xmath3 .",
    "thus we can describe the photon - pion form factors at both low @xmath3 and high @xmath3 within a same framework .",
    "the purpose if this work is to apply this framework @xcite for a systematic description of the photon - meson transition form factors of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , at both @xmath6 and @xmath7 limits , and to make predictions in a wide @xmath3 range .",
    "the photon - meson transition form factor @xmath8 can be realized in @xmath9 or @xmath4 processes .",
    "the @xmath10 transition form factors of @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 at medium to high @xmath3 have been measured at cornell  @xcite and at desy  @xcite through the @xmath12 process , while the latter process @xmath4 is convenient to provide measurement of the photon - meson transition form factors at low @xmath3 . moreover ,",
    "high precision measurements of the electromagnetic properties of these pseudoscalar mesons via primakoff effect are proposed by primex collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) @xcite , which would give the experimental value of transition form factors @xmath13 of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 at low @xmath14 , and lead to a clarification on the obvious disagreement between the former primakoff experiment and collider cases in the measurements of @xmath15 and a more precise determination of the @xmath16 mixing angle .",
    "similar measurements can be also performed by hermes collaboration at deutsche elektronen - synchrotron ( desy ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , theoretical predictions at low @xmath17 are necessary and essential for comparison with future experimental measurements .",
    "it is well known that the physical @xmath1 and @xmath2 states dominantly consist of a flavor @xmath18 octet @xmath19 and singlet @xmath20 in the @xmath18 quark model , respectively .",
    "the usual mixing scheme reads : @xmath21 using different sets of experimental data , we recalculate the value of the mixing angle @xmath22 by employing the limiting method developed by cao - signal @xcite .",
    "our results are also compatible with other approaches @xcite for the mixing angle and scheme .",
    "in general , people use the chiral perturbation theory @xcite or some other methods @xcite which deal with current quark masses in order to take the chiral symmetry and chiral anomaly into account , since the chiral symmetry predominates the @xmath23(@xmath24 , @xmath25)@xmath26 vertex at large @xmath17 @xcite , and chiral anomaly determines the @xmath23(@xmath24 , @xmath27 ) transition form factors at @xmath28 ( eqs .  ( [ pi_gamma]-[eta_gamma ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , the chiral perturbation theory is also very useful and effective in discussing the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing properties @xcite . since we are consistently using the valence quark masses in the light - cone treatment to the form factor calculation",
    ", it is not very applicable to start with current quark mass within the chiral symmetry and investigate the chiral limits in the transition form factor computation .",
    "however , our main purpose of this paper is to employ the new light - cone @xmath29 wave functions  @xcite to compute the transition form factors of the light mesons .",
    "moreover , we considered the chiral symmetry when we choose @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing scheme , and took the chiral limit approximation when we try to determine and fix the parameters",
    ". therefore our results respect the chiral symmetry and its breaking at some extent .",
    "phenomenologically , we could give the predictions of the @xmath1 and @xmath27 mixing angle within the light - cone formalism , as well as the photon - meson transition form factor which is applicable at both low and high energy scales .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the formalism for the photon - meson transition form factor using the minimal quark - antiquark fock states of the photon and pion as wave functions . in section 3",
    ", we will introduce the @xmath30 mixing scheme used in our calculation . in section 4 ,",
    "we calculate systematically the photon - meson transition form factors of @xmath31 , @xmath24 , and @xmath32 , and show that the calculated results agree with the available experimental data at medium to large @xmath17 scale .",
    "we also predict the low @xmath3 behaviors of the photon - meson transition form factors of @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , which are measurable in @xmath4 process via primakoff effect at jlab and desy . in section 5",

    "one may also state that these higher helicity components contain contribution from orbital angular moment from a relativistic viewpoint @xcite .",
    "in addition , we would like to add some more remarks on the gaussian - type wavefunction of the bhl prescription that we employ above . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the gaussian wave function is a non - relativistic solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in an instantaneous approximation in the rest frame of the meson as the space wave function .",

    "however , they also illustrated that the bhl wavefunction is better than the other four wave functions in the high @xmath65 situation ( for the @xmath69 meson ) .",

    "first of all , let us have a brief review on the chiral symmetry and its breaking which have underlying relationship with the @xmath11 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons@xcite . in the chiral symmetry limit , it is well - known that the lagrangian has the @xmath93 symmetry , but the absence of this symmetry in the ground state ( the qcd vacuum ) leads to the chiral symmetry spontaneously breaking into @xmath94 symmetry . because there are 8 spontaneously broken continuous symmetries ( there are 9 when taking into account the chiral anomaly which is associated with the the @xmath95 symmetry breaking ) , there are 8 massless goldstone bosons ( which finally are identified as meson octet ) and 1 massive particle ( which is known as @xmath20 ) according to the goldstone s theorem and chiral anomaly , respectively .",
    "the massless octet includes the meson @xmath96 and @xmath19 .",
    "together with @xmath20 , they mix into massive mesons @xmath11 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 during the explicit @xmath18 symmetry breaking after introducing the quark mass term into the lagrangian .    from the above discussion",

    "from this point of view , the introduction of @xmath20 and @xmath19 is more reasonable than @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , since it is well - known that pion , kaon , and @xmath19 belong to the same group of octet mesons in the @xmath18 symmetry limit , their parameters should be the same except the quark masses . in this sense",
    ", one may relate the decay constants of @xmath99 and @xmath2 , to pion and kaon in the @xmath100 mixing scheme .",
    "the cleo collaboration@xcite reported their pole fit results as @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "these results imply that the nonperturbative properties of @xmath104 and @xmath1 are very similar .",
    "in addition , the absolute value of @xmath22 is small and @xmath105 is the leading order in the @xmath106 mixing scheme of the @xmath1 .",
    "they are consistent with the basic physical intuition that both @xmath104 and @xmath19 are in the @xmath107 octet and are pseudo - massless goldstone particles .",
    "therefore , that is why the authors of @xcite take the parameters of @xmath19 as equal to pion , such as @xmath108 in their paper . from a strict sense ,",
