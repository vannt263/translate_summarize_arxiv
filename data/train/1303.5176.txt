    "casimir effect is a quantum effect that can not be ignored in the realm of nanotechnology .",
    "it can cause malfunctions of nano devices due to stiction @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "intensive research have been carried out to determine the exact analytic formula for the casimir effect between two nonplanar objects and its effective numerical computations ( see , for example , the references cited in @xcite ) . prior to this , one can only rely on the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) to compute an approximation for the casimir interaction , and there is no way to determine the magnitude of the error in such an approximation .    in the case of the sphere - plate setup , the most popular configuration used in casimir experiments , there is only one curvature parameter given by the radius of the sphere , @xmath1 . hence it is expected that as @xmath0 , the distance from the sphere to the plate , is much smaller than @xmath1 , the casimir interaction energy has an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath4where @xmath5 is the proximity force approximation to the casimir interaction energy .",
    "it follows that for the casimir force @xmath6 and force gradient @xmath7 , one also has expansions of the form @xmath8 a few years ago , experiments have been set up to measure @xmath2 using a micromachined torsional oscillator @xcite .",
    "this gives a more ernest reason for the theoretical computation of the next - to - leading order terms of the casimir interaction .",
    "one of the breakthroughs in casimir research brought by the achievement in explicit functional representation of the casimir interaction is that it becomes possible to compute analytically the next - to - leading terms , as has been shown in @xcite for the cylinder - plate configuration , in @xcite for the sphere - plate configuration , in @xcite for the cylinder - cylinder configuration , and in @xcite for the sphere - sphere configuration .",
    "however , except for @xcite , all the other works only deal with ideal or non - physical boundary conditions , i.e. , dirichlet , neumann , perfectly conducting , infinitely permeable or robin boundary conditions .",
    "so far no work has discussed the exact analytical computation of the next - to - leading order term in the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate when both of these objects are made of real materials , and this is the goal of the current work to deal with this problem .",
    "it should be mentioned that there has been an attempt to compute the material dependent next - to - leading order term in the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate carried out by bimonte , emig and kadar @xcite , which used the method of derivative expansion postulated in @xcite , which in turn is inspired by the work @xcite .",
    "however , it is still desirable to check the validity of the postulate in @xcite by computing the next - to - leading order terms from the exact formula for the casimir interaction",
    ". therefore , the results of our current work complement those obtained in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we recall the formula for the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate .",
    "assume that the sphere has relative permittivity @xmath9 , and the plate has relative permittivity @xmath10 . when the thicknesses of the sphere and the plate are larger than their respective skin - depths , we can model this configuration by a ball and a semi - infinite space .",
    "let @xmath0 be the distance from the sphere to the plate , and let @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the ball .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the electromagnetic casimir interaction energy of this sphere - plate configuration is given by @xmath12 where the trace tr is @xmath13 with tr being the trace over @xmath14 matrices .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath15 are given by @xmath16where @xmath17is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath18 and @xmath19is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath20here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the associated legendre functions given by @xmath23 when @xmath24 , and @xmath25 direct numerical computations of the casimir interaction energy from the formula have been performed in a few works , for example , in @xcite . in numerical computations ,",
    "the infinite matrix @xmath15 has to be truncated to a matrix of finite size .",
    "a drawback of this direct numerical computation is that when @xmath3 gets smaller , one has to use a truncated matrix of larger size for accuracy , and this is subjected to the capacity of the computer .",
    "currently , numerical computations are limited to @xmath26 . however , in experiments , we usually have @xmath27 .",
    "hence , analytical computation of the casimir interaction energy becomes desirable .",
    "in this section , we want to derive analytically the small separation asymptotic expansion of the casimir interaction energy , casimir force and the force gradient up to the next - to - leading order term",
    ".    one of the technical issues in the analytical computation of the casimir interaction energy is the appearance of the associated legendre functions @xmath22 .",
    "first notice that because of the relation and @xmath28 the matrix element @xmath29 is equal to that when @xmath30 is changed to @xmath31 .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider nonnegative @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", one can show that @xmath32differentiating with respect to @xmath33 gives@xmath34therefore , @xmath35    making a change of variables @xmath36 and expanding the logarithm in , we have @xmath37where @xmath38with @xmath39here @xmath40 = te or tm , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 . the minus signs on @xmath43 and @xmath44 in come from the two matrices @xmath45 in .",
    "let @xmath46 in the following , we make a shift of parameters @xmath47 where @xmath48when @xmath49 , the main contributions to the casimir interaction energy come from the terms with @xmath50 in the small @xmath51 expansion below , we will count the order of @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 and @xmath51 respectively . making a change of variables",

    "now we perform the small @xmath51 expansion of . writing @xmath64 as @xmath65 and using the fact that @xmath66 we have the following small @xmath51 expansion : @xmath67 in the second line",
