    "davydov@xcite formulated a model intended to explain an almost lossless energy transfer in quasi - one - dimensional biomolecular chains such as peptides , proteins and the dna .",
    "the key element in the davydov model is the coupling between excitons and phonons of the biomolecular chain .",
    "the starting point is typically the hamiltonian given by @xmath0 + \\sum_{n}^ { } \\left [ d a_n^{\\dag } a_n - j ( a_{n+1}^{\\dag } a_n + a_{n+1 } a_n^{\\dag } ) \\right ]    \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where the position of the @xmath1-th unit is @xmath2 with @xmath3 denoting the equilibrium separation and @xmath4 a displacement from equilibrium . here , @xmath5 is the associated momentum , @xmath6 the elastic modulus and @xmath7 the mass of the oscillating unit .",
    "the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 create and annihilate an exciton at site @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath10 describes the energy of a single exciton on a given site while @xmath11 refers to hopping of excitons between neighboring sites .",
    "since both constants originate from the dipolar nature of the chain s units it is obvious that they must be distance dependent .",
    "hence , denoting the relative distances between two neighboring groups as @xmath12 and @xmath13 we assume that @xmath14 and analogously that @xmath15 in most of the literature on the subject only the dependence of @xmath10 on the distance has been explicitly introduced .",
    "it is quite obvious , however , that @xmath11 should be inversely proportional to the third power of the distance ( dipole - dipole interaction ) and this for small displacements gives an approximately linear dependence of @xmath11 on the magnitude of the displacement .",
    "hence , we can postulate that : @xmath16 for a treatment of similar terms in a somewhat different spirit we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "first of all , let us note that @xmath17 is responsible for the existence of a localized solution called a davydov soliton , and this fact is irrespective of the sign of @xmath17 @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the molecular chain is locally compressed ( compressional soliton ) and for @xmath19 , the soliton is of dilatational type ( locally dilatated ) .",
    "this is not an uncommon situation in soliton bearing nonlinear lattices @xcite .",
    "it is still an open question as to the value and the sign of @xmath17 ( see for instance ref .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is clearly negative since the interaction diminishes with distance .",
    "scott@xcite had estimated for peptide chains @xmath20 from the approximate relation @xmath21 using @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24  as @xmath25 .",
    "he also gave an estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "these values will be used in subsequent numerical calculations",
    ". we will show in the sections that follow that keeping both @xmath17 and @xmath20 in the hamiltonian results in equations of motion which differ from the standard davydov system .",
    "it will be of interest to examine their solutions and find out whether solitons can be formed and what affects their properties .",
    "based on the results of the previous section we rewrite the davydov hamiltonian s exciton part as @xmath27 a_n^{\\dag } a_n \\\\ \\nonumber & - & \\sum_n^ { } a_n^{\\dag } \\left[(j_0 + \\chi_2(u_n - u_{n-1}))a_{n-1 } + ( j_0 + \\chi_2(u_{n+1}-u_n))a_{n+1 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is responsible for on - site excitations and the second for hopping .    in the next stage",
    "we find the continuum limit of both the excitonic part @xmath28 given above and the phonon contribution @xmath29 .",
    "to make the continuum limit we take : @xmath30 and define @xmath31 as a result , the phonon part of the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath32.\\ ] ] the exciton contribution to the davydov hamiltonian is found as @xmath33 \\\\ \\nonumber & - & \\int dx \\ , \\left ( j_0 + \\chi_2 d% \\left ( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right )",

    "our next task is to derive equations of motion for the coupled phonon field @xmath36 and the exciton field @xmath37 .",
    "this can be done using several approaches , e.g. through functional minimization , coherent state ansatz , etc . in the following section we derive these equations by treating phonons classically and taking a special ansatz for excitons .",
    "in order to derive equations of motion we assume the phonons to be virtually classical so that hamilton s equations can be applied to @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "the exciton part is approximated by the expectation value of @xmath28 in the trial ground state @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a complex probability amplitude of an exciton wave and @xmath41is the vacuum .",

    "( [ ode1 ] ) and ( [ ode2 ] ) reduce to the original system of davydov equations @xcite .    to proceed",
    "we note that the second term in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( [ ode1 ] ) is much smaller than the first one .",
    "this is on the account of the fact that for large solitons , @xmath62",
    ". we can then integrate eq .",
    "( [ ode1 ] ) once to yield @xmath63 this can then be substituted into eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) to give @xmath64 where , to simplify notation , we introduced the following symbols @xmath65 and @xmath66    eq . ( 4.6 ) has two free parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath55 ( the velocity of the soliton ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is fixed by the requirement that the excitonic wave function be normalized , ie .",
    "@xmath67 using the transformation @xmath68 we obtain from eq .",
    "( 4.6 ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 eq . ( [ bern - eq ] ) is a bernoulli equation which can be completely integrated and its general solution is @xmath72 where @xmath73 in our case @xmath74 and eq .",
    "( [ bern - sol ] ) yields @xmath75 this final equation can be integrated numerically in terms of periodic and localized solutions .",
    "note that for @xmath76 only singular or periodic solutions can be found .",
    "before we present a complete analysis of the various solutions we note that in the limit of @xmath77 we find the standard elliptic equation @xcite , i.e. @xmath78 since @xmath79 . here , elliptic waves can be found in a standard way , and for @xmath80 we find the davydov soliton as @xmath81",
    "in solving eq.([final - eq ] ) , we assumed the values of model parameters consistent with those used for peptide chains@xcite .",
    "these values are : @xmath82 for illustration purposes , we have chosen to investigate slow solitons ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "physical values for @xmath20 are on the order of @xmath84 pn , and we will look at values within this range .",
    "note that @xmath20 must be negative since dipole - dipole interaction decreases with separation .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is still an open question .",
    "experiments seem to indicate that @xmath85 pn .",
    "this would correspond to a compressional soliton . on the other hand , theoretical estimates range from @xmath86 pn raising the possibility of dilatational solitons ( for @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , we will investigate both positive and negative values for @xmath17 .    in the case of compressional solitons ( @xmath18 ) , qualitatively nothing special happens . including the effect of @xmath20",
    "simply enhances the stability of the soliton .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "with @xmath87 , we see from eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) that @xmath88 which immediately implies that the denominator of @xmath89 given in eq .",
    "( 4.18 ) is increased .",
    "this means that in the compressed chain , the effective @xmath90 is larger .",
    "if @xmath91 , it follows that @xmath92 . in this case , the soliton is dilated and the dipole - dipole interaction is weakened which can lead to a destabilization of the soliton itself .",
    "we have examined how the form of the localized solution ( soliton ) changes with the value of @xmath20 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where we see a gradual sharpening effect at the peak of the soliton solution starting from the standard davydov form at @xmath93 .",
    "the soliton disappears at a relatively low value of @xmath94 , well within the range of physically acceptable values .",
    "this effect has been carefully investigated through analysis of the numerator and denominator of @xmath89 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ final - eq ] ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , @xmath95 is required for solitary wave solutions to exist . of utmost importance to what follows",
    "is the location and reality of the roots of the numerator in @xmath89 .",
    "obviously a double root exists at @xmath96 , and the remaining four roots are pairwise symmetrical with respect to sign reversal .",
    "we shall label the squares of these roots simply as @xmath97 . with this in place , we note that the singularity in the denominator of @xmath89 coincides with @xmath98 at a point @xmath99 .",
    "we have determined that the value of @xmath100 at which the solitonic solutions are destroyed is given by @xmath101 substituting the parameter values from eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) into eq . ( 5.2 ) we find that for our system @xmath102 pn which is close to what is physically expected .",
    "the role of @xmath20 in changing the topology of @xmath89 is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . we show in fig .",
    "3 the region of stable solitons as deduced from the relative position of the roots of the numerator of @xmath89 and the zero of the denominator .",
    "this paper has discussed the distance dependence of exciton hopping in the davydov model .",
    "two cases needed to be discussed separately . in the case of compressional solitons ( @xmath18 ) , soliton stability was enhanced simply because in the soliton , the average distance between molecules was decreased , leading to a higher hopping probability . if this was the case in peptide chains , the conclusions reached through thermal stability studies of the standard davydov model ( ref .",
    "@xcite and others therein ) might be unduly pessimistic .",
    "the second case of @xmath19 corresponds to a dilatational soliton .",
    "here there exists a critical value of @xmath20 , beyond which davydov - like solitons cease to exist .",
    "this critical value is surprisingly close to physical values and therefore it is to be expected that thermal fluctuations at physiological temperatures would destroy the soliton .",
