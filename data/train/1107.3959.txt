    "topological insulators are materials with gapped bulk states but gapless surface states.@xcite due to the topological origin and dirac fermion nature of the topological surface states , the topological insulators are expected to have excellent performance in transport.@xcite one of intriguing transport features of topological insulators is the weak antilocalization ( wal ) , appearing as the negative magnetoconductivity with a sharp cusp in low fields.@xcite wal is intrinsic to topological insulators : ( i ) so far , most samples have low mobility and long coherence length , making the quantum interference an important correction to the diffusion transport ; ( ii ) due to the spin - momentum locking resulted from strong spin - orbit coupling , the single gapless dirac cone of the topological surface states carries a @xmath0 berry phase,@xcite which changes the interference of time - reversed scattering loops from constructive to destructive",
    ". the destructive interference will give the conductivity an enhancement , which can be destroyed by applying a magnetic field that breaks the @xmath0 berry phase , leading to the negative magnetoconductivity with the cusp .",
    "wal is always expected in systems with either strong spin - orbit scattering or coupling.@xcite due to vacancies and defects , most as - grown topological insulators have also bulk band carriers which actually dominate the transport.@xcite the bulk bands of topological insulator possess strong spin - orbit coupling , strong enough to invert the normal band structure and give rise to the topological phase transition that defines the nontrivial nature of topological insulators .",
    "one of the simplest choices when considering the conduction bands of a band insulator with spin - orbit coupling that respects time - reversal symmetry is the rashba model @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the planck constant over @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the wave vector , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the effective electron mass , and @xmath7 are pauli matrices that describe the electron spin .",
    "the rashba model describes two branches of conduction bands , each band has spin locked to momentum , just like the gapless surface states of topological insulator . as a result , the berry phase for each band of the rashba model also gives exact @xmath0.@xcite according to the @xmath0 berry phase argument , if the bulk bands of a topological insulator were described by the rashba model , they should also have the weak antilocalization in the quantum diffusion transport , just like the gapless surface states .",
    "experimentally , the weak antilocalization is studied by fitting the magnetoconductivity with the hikami - larkin - nagaoka formula,@xcite @xmath8 , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the digamma function , @xmath10 is the magnetic field , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two fitting parameters , @xmath12 is an effective phase coherence length .",
    "@xmath11 is a prefactor , each band that carries a @xmath0 berry phase should give an @xmath13 prefactor.@xcite in the weak interband coupling limit , multiple independent bands with wal should add up to give bigger negative @xmath11 , e.g. , -1 , -1.5 .",
    "the experimentally fitted @xmath11 covers a wide range between around -0.4 and -1.1 , suggesting that the observed wal can be interpreted by considering only one or two surface bands,@xcite despite of the coexistence of multiple carrier channels from bulk and surface bands at the fermi surface .",
    "even , the sharp wal cusp can be completely suppressed by doping magnetic impurities only on the top surface of a topological insulator.@xcite why the observed wal seems to be weakly tied to the bulk bands with strong spin - orbit coupling still poses a mystery to both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "various interpretations were proposed , such as electron - electron interaction@xcite and the mixture of the surface states on the top and bottom surfaces of the topological thin film.@xcite    in this work , we try to investigate the role played by the bulk states in the quantum diffusion transport of a topological insulator thin film .",
    "we find that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) modified dirac model can provide a unified description for both the surface bands and the lowest 2d bulk subbands of a topological insulator thin film .",
    "we derive the magnetoconductivity formula for the 2d modified dirac model in the weak interband scattering limit . in this unified description ,",
    "whether one has weak antilocalization or weak localization ( wl ) is governed mainly by the mass ( gap ) term in the modified dirac model . in the massless limit ,",
    "one has weak antilocalization , while a finite gap can lead to the weak localization or the unitary behavior .",
    "contrast to the gapless surface states , the bulk states of a topological insulator actually have relatively large gap .",
    "therefore , while the surface bands probably exhibit weak antilocalization , we suggest that bulk bands may reside in the weak localization or the unitary regime .",

    "weak antilocalization \" may be a collective result from both the weak antilocalization of the surface channels and weak localization ( or unitary behavior ) of the bulk channels .",
    "this may help to explain why the fitting parameters of the hikami - larkin - nagaoka formula cover a wide range in the experiments.@xcite the unitary behavior ( with small magnetoconductivity proportional to the square of the magnetic filed ) of bulk channels may help to understand why the bulk states seem  missing \" in the magnetoconductivity although they actually dominate the transport .",
