    "large surveys such as sdss are beginning to enable detailed studies to be made of the properties of the milky way .",
    "it is now possible to construct high - precision catalogues of stars with full 3d kinematics and from these analyse the structure and evolution of our galaxy . in the following proceedings",
    "i summarise our study of the disk of the milky way ( presented in full in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , highlighting two of the most important results .",
    "we use data from the 7th public data release of the sdss , concentrating on the 250 square degree stripe 82 region for which it is possible to obtain high precision photometry and proper motions @xcite .",
    "this catalogue has been exploited in a variety of works , covering white dwarfs @xcite , halo kinematics @xcite and rr lyrae in the outer halo @xcite .",
    "we take all dwarf stars with good quality spectra @xcite , estimating distances using a slightly modified version of the @xcite photometric parallax relation .",
    "our modification concerns the turn - off correction ( equation a6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we argue is not applicable to disk stars ( see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "we then calculate the three - dimensional velocities for our sample , propagating all uncertainties , and obtain final errors of around 20 to 30 @xmath0 for each component of the velocity .    as we are interested in the kinematics of the disk as a function of height from the plane , we restrict ourselves to @xmath1 .",
    "we also split the data into three ranges in metallicity ( @xmath2}\\le -0.8 , -0.8 \\le { [ { \\rm fe / h}]}\\le -0.5 $ ] and @xmath3}$ ] ) , and then for each metallicity bin we further divide the data into four ranges in z out to a maximum distance of 2 kpc . the stars are equally divided between the four distance bins , resulting in in around @xmath4 to @xmath5 stars per bin from our full sample of 7280 stars .",
    "this binning is necessary in order to avoid having to model the sdss spectroscopic selection function .",
    "once we have divided up our stars , we then proceed to fit the distribution of kinematics using maximum likelihood methods ( incorporating the uncertainties on the individual velocities ) .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fit using gaussian distributions , but since it is well known that the distribution of @xmath8 for the disk is highly skewed and non - gaussian we adopt an asymmetric functional form ( equation ( 15 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "when carrying out this analysis it is crucial to remove contamination from halo stars , particularly for the most metal - poor bins .",
    "we do this by including a non - rotating gaussian component into the velocity fits , where the level of contamination ( and hence amplitude of the gaussian ) is assumed to be twice the number of counter - rotating stars .",
    "the halo dispersions are fixed according to the values found in @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the results are presented in @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the most important properties , starting with rotation lag .",
    "we are able to trace the lag ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lag ] ) to a couple of kpc outside the plane and find that it follows the well - known asymmetric drift relation .",
    "the hotter ( metal - poor ) stars exhibit greater lag than the colder ( metal - rich ) populations , resulting in a clear correlation between lag and metallicity .",
    "the gradient of the lag with respect to @xmath9z@xmath9 varies from around 15 to 40 @xmath10 , depending on metallicity .",
    "[ fig : lag ] also shows how the lag is correlated with @xmath11 . for the solar - neighbourhood",
    "it is know that this is a linear relation @xcite , but as we can see from our figure this is no longer true once we move beyond 0.5 kpc .",
    "however , it can be seen that there is still a relatively tight correlation with @xmath11 , which is independent of metallicity .    .",
    "figure taken from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=173 ] . figure taken from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=173 ]",
    "as has been shown by many authors , most notably in the seminal work of @xcite , the vertical velocity dispersion profile can be used to constrain the gravitational potential of the disk .",
    "we show the results derived from our data in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , where we have included an additional solar - neighbourhood metal - rich data point derived from the geneva - copenhagen survey @xcite .",
    "we take a simplified two - parameter model for the potential , consisting of an infinite razor - thin sheet embedded in a constant background .",
    "our best - fit model estimates that the mass density of these two components are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , our measurement of the potential is in good agreement with existing models , especially model 1 of @xcite .",
    "this is the least halo - dominated model of @xcite , with the disk ( which has a relatively short scale - length ) dominating the circular speed at the solar neighborhood .",
    "interested readers should consult section 2.7 of @xcite for a detailed comparison of these models .",
    "note that this background mass density is close to the @xmath14 predicted using isothermal spherical halo models ( equation 4.279 of * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume our background mass represents the dark halo , it corresponds to a local dark matter density of 0.57 @xmath15 , which is noticeably larger than the canonical value of 0.30 @xmath15 typically assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis adds still more weight to the argument the local halo density may be substantially underestimated by this generally accepted value .",
    "perhaps more robust than the local mass density is the surface mass density . by integrating our mass distribution",
    "we obtain a total surface mass density of @xmath16 , which agrees well with the classical value of @xmath17 from @xcite .",
    "if we integrate beyond 1.1 kpc , we find @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "our results ( presented in full in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to address the global properties of the disk and also the heating processes that have shaped its evolution . in order to fully understand the nature of disk heating and to disentangle the contributions from various mechanisms",
    ", one needs to go beyond the work presented here .",
    "the most crucial improvement will be the ability to make direct estimates for stellar ages , rather than relying on correlations with metallicity .",
    "one aspect that will help us in this effort is by folding in measurements of alpha - element abundances that are now being determined routinely for vast numbers of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* question : * ( nicolas martin ) can you develop your model to test for the presence of a dark disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* reply : * due to the limitations of the data that we have used there are a number of uncertainties in our modelling . as a consequence of these limitations ,",
    "i think it would be difficult to include extra parameters .",
