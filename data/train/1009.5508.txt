    "the isospin violating strong decay @xmath3 allows access to light quark mass ratios . at lowest order of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the light quark mass difference @xmath6 and may be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pion decay constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at higher order of chpt",
    "it has been found that final state pion interaction contribute to the decay width@xcite@xmath11@xcite .",
    "the decay width scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the decay width @xmath15 and @xmath16 are calculated in the dashen limit@xcite .",
    "this scaling works under the pre - requisite that @xmath15 is understood reliably . to test this , theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of pion kinematical distributions",
    "may be compared in a dalitz plot , where the axes are defined as @xmath17 , @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the kinetic energies of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath25 .",
    "the standard way to parametrize the dalitz plot density is a polynomial expansion around the center point : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the dalitz plot parameters .",
    "the experimental results are dominated by kloe with a dalitz plot containing 1.34@xmath2810@xmath29 events @xcite .",
    "this result shows a significant deviation of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in comparison to the theoretical predictions based on chpt .",
    "it is therefore important to perform an independent measurement , which is one of the aims of the wasa - at - cosy experiment .",
    "in 2008 and 2009 wasa - at - cosy@xcite measured @xmath32 reaction at beam energy 1  gev , collecting @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath0 mesons respectively . the missing mass with respect to @xmath35",
    "is used to tag the @xmath0 meson ( fig .",
    "[ mm(he ) ] left ) .",
    "in addition two tracks of opposite charge are required in the mini drift chamber in the angular range @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore two photons with an invariant mass close to @xmath24 are required .",
    "the @xmath37 reaction is reduced by imposing conditions on the missing mass calculated for @xmath38 and the missing mass calculated for @xmath39 .",
    "the preliminary analysis yields 149 000 @xmath3 candidates from the 2008 data , shown in fig .  [ mm(he ) ]  right .",
    "the experimental resolution is better for the @xmath0 four - momenta from @xmath35 compared to the information derived from the @xmath0 decay products .",
    "therefore a kinematical fit for the reaction @xmath40 has been used with @xmath41 observables fixed and a cut on the 1% level of the probability density function . to estimate the @xmath0 content in each dalitz plot bin",
    ", a four - degree polynomial fit is performed over the background region and the fitted polynomial is subtracted in the signal region .",
    "the preliminary experimental results for the @xmath42,@xmath43 projections of the dalitz plot are compared in fig .",
    "[ xyprojection ] to monte carlo simulations of the @xmath3 weighted with the tree - level prediction ( equation 1 ) .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath45 reaction was conducted in 2008 and in 2010 at beam kinetic energy 1.4  gev . the collected sample of data yields about 10@xmath46 produced @xmath0 mesons .",
    "two protons were registered using plastic scintillator detectors and straw tube trackers and the charged pions were detected with plastic scintillator detectors and the mini drift chamber .",
    "two protons were used to tag the @xmath0 meson in the missing mass plot showed in fig .",
    "[ mz ]  left ( here we present data only from one run ) .",
    "[ mz ]    the two @xmath47 originating from the @xmath24 meson decay were registered in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the invariant mass of these@xmath47 is required to be close to the mass of the @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ mz ]  middle ) . requiring two @xmath47 in coincidence with the two protons",
    "gives the missing mass as shown in fig .",
    "[ mz ]  right .",
    "the work for both _ pd _ and _ pp _ data will be continued in order to obtain two independent determinations of the dalitz plot density for the @xmath3 .",
    "this includes estimating systematical errors as well as tuning monte carlo simulation .",
