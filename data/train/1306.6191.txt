    "the astrophysical sky brightness is dominated by the zodiacal light ( zl ) which comprises scattered sunlight by interplanetary dust ( ipd ) in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) , and thermal zodiacal emission ( ze ) from the same ipd in the mid - infrared ( mir ) or longer .",
    "historically , extensive zl observations in the scattered sunlight regime were conducted from ground - based observations at high altitude sites in the 1960 s and 1970 s @xcite .",
    "however , these were restricted to optical wavelengths because atmospheric thermal emission and oh airglow are much brighter than the zl at nir and mir .",
    "space based platforms get rid of contaminations and provide precise measurements of the diffuse sky brightness at nir and mir @xcite . based on measurements from the cobe / dirbe ,",
    "physical models for the ipd distribution have been constructed @xcite to estimate the zodiacal foreground for measurements of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) @xcite .",
    "three major components are known in the dirbe ipd distribution model @xcite ; ( 1 ) a smooth cloud which is dominant component of zl ( @xmath3 ) , ( 2 ) three asteroidal dust bands found by iras @xcite whose parent bodies were identified as being associated with certain asteroid families @xcite , and ( 3 ) a circumsolar ring which was formed by dusts resonantly trapped by the earth @xcite . because materials likely to be present in the ipd have distinct spectral features at nir and mir , spectroscopic measurement of zl helps to determine the composition of ipd particles . for example , silicate features were found in the zl spectrum at nir by irts @xcite and ciber @xcite , and at mir by irts @xcite , iso @xcite and akari @xcite .",

    "the zl spectrum has a local minimum in this wavelength region because the contributions from scattered component and thermal emission component from ipd are about equal at around 3.5 @xmath0 m . for this purpose",
    ", we constructed a low - resolution ( @xmath1 ) spectral catalog of diffuse sky spectrum in 1.8 - 5.3 @xmath0 m wavelength region with irc spanning wide range of ecliptic and galactic coordinates .",
    "this catalog of diffuse sky spectra is available at isas / jaxa .",
    "there are two companion papers describing the spectrum of the infrared diffuse sky ; the diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) is described in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) and ebl is described in @xcite ( hereafter paper iii ) in which the foregrounds described in paper ii and this paper ( paper i ) are subtracted .",

    "temperature of irc was stable and kept less than 7 k during the cold mission @xcite .",
    "one of akari s advantages over spitzer for observation of diffuse sky is a cold shutter .",
    "akari equips the black position in its filter wheel so it can measure the dark current for the absolute photometry of the diffuse radiation , while the cold shutter of spitzer has not been operated in the orbit @xcite .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig2.eps    dataset used in this study was obtained via akari catalogue archive server ( cas ) @xcite .",
    "first , 349 pointed data were selected on the condition that ( 1 ) it includes prism spectroscopy data , and ( 2 ) it was taken in the cold mission without any earthshine contamination ( from september 2006 to may 2007 , see @xcite for the earthshine contamination ) . some data were excluded because of stray light from very bright sources in the exposed region as shown in figure [ bads ] . the data in which some astronomical objects ( eg .",
    "orion nebula or magellanic clouds ) are on the slit were also excluded because our target is general interstellar / intergalactic region for the diffuse sky spectra . in final ,",
    "278 pointed data were obtained as shown in table [ datatable ] , figure [ data_distribution ] , and figure [ nep_distribution ] .",
    "the data points are distributed over wide range of ecliptic and galactic coordinates as shown in figure [ data_distribution ] although they are not perfectly non - biased .",
    "because of the akari s sun - synchronous polar orbit , north ecliptic pole ( nep ) region , including akari nep field @xcite and irac dark field @xcite , was frequently observed in different seasons as shown in figure [ nep_distribution ] .",
    ".data number and position in this study [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this study , we adopted special data reduction besides the public tool kit @xcite .",
    "first , we developed a new dark current estimation method specialized for the diffuse sky analysis , in which the dark current of each pixel was estimated from the averaged dark current at the masked region .",
    "this method provides a more reliable estimate of the dark current suffering from an after effect due to strong cosmic ray hits occurring in the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) region .",
    "typical value of dark current in the spectral region is 5 - 50 adu , and error due to dark current subtraction by this method is reduced to about 1 adu equivalent to 3 nwm@xmath7sr@xmath8  at 2 @xmath0 m .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig3.eps      it can be assumed that the detector behaves linearly below 5000 adu @xcite . since the signals of diffuse sky even at the galactic plane in this study is less than 2000 adu , no linearity correction is required for our analysis .      since the flat fielding procedure for slit spectroscopy provided in the public tool kit @xcite is not sufficient , we constructed a new flat field specialized for our purpose from our dataset .",
    "our dataset includes 80 pointed data at the akari nep field ( see table [ datatable ] ) where zl dominates the sky brightness .",
    "although the absolute brightness of zl varies with seasons , its spectral shape is almost the same as shown in the latter part in this paper .",
    "therefore , the new flat field was constructed by nep data .    by assuming that the diffuse sky brightness is constant along the slit length ( @xmath6-direction , 0.8 arcmin ) , relative sensitivity of pixels along the slit for",
    "all given @xmath5 columns in the spectral region of a given image can be corrected by comparing to the averaged signal , and a flat field was obtained by averaging the all 80 spectral images .",
    "figure [ flat ] compares the resultant our flat field image with the existing one in the public tool kit .",
    "a large scale distribution of sensitivity is reproduced in our new flat field with less deviation .",
    "this flat field correction reduces the errors by 5% comparing to the existing old flat field . note that relative sensitivity along the x - direction can not be corrected in our method since no light source with flat ( white ) spectrum is available .",
    "in addition , it can not correct column pull downs owing to hot pixels fixed in the detector array .      field stars falling on the slit should be masked to derive the diffuse sky spectrum .",
    "data package of each field includes several raw frames depending on astronomical observation template ( aot ; see @xcite for details of aot ) , and position of stars are slightly different among these raw frames due to the attitude instability of the satellite during pointed observations .",
    "therefore , stars should be masked on each raw frames .",
    "spectra of point sources appear as horizontal lines on the spectral images , which were recognized and masked . in this procedure , stars brighter than @xmath9 were detected on the slit and masked .",
    "it was confirmed that the brightness due to unresolved galactic stars under this detection limit is negligible by a milky way star counts model , trilegal @xcite .",

    "( 120mm,80mm)fig6.eps      after the reductions of dark current subtraction , flat field correction , and masking , signals on the spectral region were averaged along the @xmath6-direction at each @xmath5 bin with 3@xmath12 clipping to removing the remaining week hot pixels . in this procedure , the one - dimensional spectra of the diffuse sky in pixel - adu units were obtained , and the statistic error is evaluated by the dispersion along the @xmath6-direction .",

    "although signals at the masked region should be zero because dark current was subtracted , left - side masked region has non - zero signals .",
    "it is thought to be owing to scattered light from the exposed region because it is correlated weakly with the sky brightness , but an exact reason is still unknown . in this study , we modeled this excess component practically by a simple interpolation and subtracted it from the spectra as shown in figure [ baseline ] . statistical dispersion from this model is @xmath14 % of the sky brightness , which is included in the statistical uncertainty .      next , we need to convert pixel position ( @xmath5-axis ) to wavelength , and adu to physical unit in surface brightness . as described in @xcite ,",
    "the pixel position @xmath5 for a given wavelength @xmath15 [ @xmath0 m ] is expressed in a 2nd - order polynomial equation as , @xmath16 in this work , we employed the parameter set as ( @xmath17 ) = ( 4.82 , 17.33 , 221.59 ) for slit spectroscopy . for an object not on the slit ( for example , a standard star in the exposed region described in section [ cal ] ) , position can be corrected by adding a position offset between the slit position and the target object taking account of the distortion .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)fig7.eps      to obtain a response function used for converting from adu unit to physical unit in surface brightness , we used a spectrum of a standard star kf09t1 , a k0iii star with m@xmath18=8.114 mag .",
    "this star is also used for the absolute calibration of the infrared array camera ( irac ) on spitzer @xcite .",
    "figure [ calstar ] shows the images of kf09t1 .",
    "akari data include both long exposure images and short exposure images , and we used the long exposure images for diffuse sky spectra in this study . however , since short wavelength region of the kf09t1 spectrum is saturated or non - linearly accumulated with long exposure as shown in figure [ calstar ] , we also used the short exposure images to derive the spectrum of kf09t1 in adu unit .",
    "the long / short exposure ratio is known to be 38.0 in adu and this factor is used for converting the response function from short exposure to long exposure . since the spectrum of kf09t1 is provided with 3% accuracy and the solid angle equivalent to the slit width of irc is also known , the response function from adu to surface brightness unit is obtained by comparing these spectra .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig8.eps    the other factor of calibration error comes from wavelength uncertainty at given pixels owing to the sub - pixel misalignment of the star , since it is difficult to estimate the exact position of the star on the detector array within sub - pixel accuracy .",
    "therefore , this type of calibration error was estimated by wavelength shift equivalent to the sub - pixel position uncertainty of @xmath20.5 pixels . as shown in figures [ mask ] and [ baseline ] ,",
    "photons converge at the shortest wavelengths owing to wavelength dispersion of the prism , i.e. wavelength width @xmath19 at the pixels of shortest wavelengths is much greater than other pixels .",
    "therefore , small sub - pixel position uncertainty causes a large systematic calibration error at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath102.2 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "in addition , since the signal at the shortest wavelength region is strong , its psf wing contaminates neighbor pixels , which is another error source . to avoid them ,",
    "a photometric method was employed only for the shortest wavelength by using the psf profile of irc imaging data with n2 ( 1.9 - 2.8 @xmath0 m ) filter .",
    "figure [ psffit ] is the spectrum of kf09t1 with short exposure and its best fit photometry at shortest wavelengths with the n2 psf profile , and it shows that shortest - side wing of the spectrum can be fit by the n2 psf well .",
    "for deriving the absolute response of the diffuse sky , n2 psf fitting at shortest wavelengths was conducted and surface brightness of the sky at shortest wavelength was obtained by comparing the best - fit psf of kf09t1 at first .",
    "then , spectrum at other wavelengths were derived after subtracting the best - fit psf profiles .",

    "the ratio of these spectra has a step at around 3.5 @xmath0 m where the scattered and thermal emission component are comparable , and both sides of the step are flat .",
    "it can be understood with a simple explanation ; spectral shapes of the scattered components and thermal emission component do not depend on location , which make the flat ratios , but the relative brightness between those components vary with location , which makes the step at around 3.5 @xmath0 m .",

    "therefore , the color temperature of ze at ecliptic pole becomes higher than that at the ecliptic plane , because closer dusts with higher temperature contributes to ze more than that at the ecliptic plane .",
    "for example , iras observation at 12 , 25 , and 60 @xmath0 m obtained @xmath25 k at the ecliptic pole and @xmath26 k at the ecliptic planem data were also used at the ecliptic plane . ] with single temperature fitting @xcite , and iso spectroscopic observation at 5 - 16 @xmath0 m obtained @xmath27 k at the ecliptic pole , while @xmath28 k ( solar elongation = 60@xmath21 ) and @xmath29 k ( solar elongation = 120@xmath21 ) at the ecliptic plane @xcite . a similar result can be obtained also from the dirbe zl model @xcite .",

    "we tested this temperature dependence at various ecliptic latitude in our akari dataset of diffuse spectra at 3 - 5 @xmath0 m wavelength region , while the temperature in previous studies ( iras , iso , and dirbe ) were determined at longer wavelengths ( @xmath305 @xmath0 m ) of ze spectrum .",

    "these wavelengths are chosen for avoiding the contamination from scattering component at shorter wavelengths and the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah band .",
    "although the ratio between 4.0 @xmath0 m and 4.9 @xmath0 m directly correspond to the color temperature of ze , any dependence on ecliptic latitude can not be found and the color temperature of ze is 300@xmath210 k at any ecliptic latitude .",
    "similar analysis was conducted at other wavelengths but no ecliptic latitude dependence was found from this akari zl data . in conclusion , the spectral shape of ze at 3 - 5 @xmath0 m with akari irc does not show any dependance on ecliptic latitude , and its color temperature ( 300 k ) is higher than the peak temperature .",

    "<S> we present the near- and mid - infrared zodiacal light spectrum obtained with the akari infra - red camera ( irc ) . </S>",
    "<S> a catalog of 278 spectra of the diffuse sky covering a wide range of galactic and ecliptic latitudes was constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength range of this catalog is 1.8 - 5.3 @xmath0 m with wavelength resolution of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> advanced reduction methods specialized for the slit spectroscopy of diffuse sky spectra are developed for constructing the spectral catalog . </S>",
    "<S> based on the comparison analysis of the spectra collected in different seasons and ecliptic latitudes , we confirmed that the spectral shape of the scattered component and the thermal emission component of the zodiacal light in our wavelength range does not show any dependence on location and time , but relative brightness between them varies with location . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirmed that the color temperature of the zodiacal emission at 3 - 5 @xmath0 m is 300@xmath210 k at any ecliptic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> this emission is expected to be originated from sub - micron dust particles in the interplanetary space . </S>"
