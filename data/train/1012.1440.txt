    "in the setting of local quantum field theory , all information on the spectrum resides in the green functions of the theory , as they build up the scattering @xmath0-matrix .",
    "a special class of green functions are the two - point functions .",
    "we should not only consider the elementary propagators of the theory , but also the two - point functions of local composite operators , which correspond to propagating bound states , are relevant .",
    "scattering amplitudes are in general analytic functions of the lorentz invariants constructed from the external momenta characterizing a given process . in the present work we shall only be interested in two - point functions which can be considered as functions of the external momentum @xmath1 , analytically continued to the complex @xmath2-plane with a cut on the real axis starting at @xmath3 , which is identified as the threshold for multi - particle production .",
    "such a two - point correlation function can be cast in the form of a dispersion relation , that is , an integral representation written in terms of the function s discontinuities in the complex plane .",
    "for the two - point function of an arbitrary operator @xmath4 we can write the general expression @xmath5 the imaginary part in the argument of the integral stands for the discontinuity of the function @xmath6 across the cut .",
    "this ought to be a positive definite quantity proportional to the total cross - section , as demanded by the optical theorem .",
    "the representation is known as the klln - lehmann spectral representation . for a concise treatment ,",
    "let us refer to e.g.   @xcite .",
    "this klln - lehmann spectral representation can be constructed , for the case of real masses in minkowski space , through the use of the cutkosky cut rules @xcite , which state that , in order to calculate the discontinuity associated with a feynman diagram , we just need to cut propagator lines in the diagram in all possible ways , thereby replacing the corresponding propagators by @xmath7-functions localizing to the physical phase space , and then to sum over all these contributions .",
    "physically , we place the particles running in these lines on - shell .    specifying for a moment to the strong interaction , it is well - known that qcd exhibits confinement , i.e.  the color - charged elementary degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) do not propagate in the physical world .",
    "the observables are the color - neutral bound states , corresponding to the gauge invariant operators constructed from the gluon and quarks fields , being the mesons , baryons , glueballs and quark - gluon hybrids .",
    "a big contemporary challenge is to extract information on that nonperturbative spectrum using theoretical , phenomenological and/or numerical lattice tools . in the so - called sum rules approach to the qcd spectrum ,",
    "spectral representations play a pivotal role , we refer to the comprehensive tome @xcite , to @xcite for the seminal works , or to @xcite for a pedestrian s introduction .    in many approaches to qcd , including the sum rules ,",
    "an important role is played by the elementary propagators , in particular the gluon propagator , which is usually studied in the landau gauge , @xmath8 .",
    "the elementary propagators are the fundamental building blocks of more complicated green functions , including the ones corresponding to bound states @xcite .",
    "for some recent advancements on the gluon propagator , including numerical lattice results , let us refer to the non - extensive list of @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the landau gauge gluon propagator exhibits a violation of positivity @xcite , a fact which also received direct lattice confirmation @xcite .",
    "this violation of positivity means nothing more than that there can not exist a klln - lehmann representation @xcite , hence the landau gauge gluon is unphysical , and it can be interpreted as a reflection of confinement . in @xcite , it was discussed how @xmath9 can qualitatively and quantitatively describe the lattice predictions for the ( infrared ) landau gauge gluon propagator , and this up to @xmath10 .",
    "the expression can be seen as a dynamically improved version of the so - called gribov propagator , @xmath11 which attracted a lot of attention as a prototype of a confining gluon propagator , and which is related to the dealing with the issue of gauge ( gribov ) copies in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "given that works out well , it might subsequently be used in explicit computations , for example when one would like to learn something on the glueball or meson spectrum .",
    "we notice that the propagator can be decomposed into 2 yukawa propagators , with either 2 real , or 2 complex conjugate masses , depending on the relative size of the scales present .",
    "the case of 2 complex conjugate masses seems to be realized @xcite , and a ( tree level ) positivity violation is then guaranteed .",
    "the unphysical degrees of freedom corresponding to those complex conjugate masses were called @xmath12-particles @xcite .",
    "also the so - called stingl propagator @xcite , @xmath13 can exhibit a pair of complex conjugate poles , as a special case of .",
    "if we are interested in a spectral function inspired approach to e.g.  bound states in theories with propagators of the type , we of course would need to know how to compute with such a propagator .",
    "research in this direction was initiated with the work on a toy model @xcite , where the necessary spectral densities were computed by clever manipulations , which unfortunately do not have general applicability , or , more realistically , for gauge theories in @xcite by using the cutkosky cut rules and assuming that the results can be continued to euclidean space and the case of complex conjugate masses .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that the cut rules results , which we summarized in section 2 , are actually correct .",
    "we shall therefore bring to attention in section 3 the stieltjes integral transformation , as well as its inverse , as studied by widder @xcite , which allows to compute directly in euclidean space the spectral density , even in cases when there is no cut rules prescription .",
    "we shall work out an introductory example in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 , we comment on the use of subtracted spectral representations to avoid divergences .",
    "we then present in section 6 in full detail the most interesting case of 2 @xmath12-particle propagators with complex conjugate masses , wherefore a completely analytical treatment can also be given . in our concluding remarks ,",
    "section 7 , we point out that the widder result to compute the spectral function could perhaps also be used in a numerical context when more complicated propagators than e.g.   are used , which are completely inadequate for fully analytical computations .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is a generic ( composite ) operator containing 2 fields .",
    "we are then interested in the study of the following @xmath15-loop expression @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a function of the lorentz invariants constructed from the momenta flowing in the loop . for simplicity",
    ", we may assume @xmath18 to be a scalar function , thus a fortiori also @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 would carry lorentz indices , say @xmath19 , the eventual correlation function @xmath20 would be a tensor object .",
    "one can always decompose this tensor into a suitably constructed basis ( using the vector @xmath21 and trivial unit tensors ) , and by projecting on the basic tensor structures , one can construct the spectral densities associated to each structure . the latter problem can then be reduced to that of the scalar case by contractions .",
    "for example , assume that the two - point function is a rank 2 tensor , @xmath22 .",
    "each rank two tensor can be decomposed into its transversal and longitudinal part , according to @xmath23 so that knowledge of @xmath24 , resp .",
    "@xmath25 , follows from the ( scalar ) quantity @xmath26 , resp .",
    "@xmath27 . using these scalar objects",
    ", one can the construct the spectral densities corresponding to the transversal and longitudinal piece of the two - point functionb .",
    "the here described procedure can be generalized to more complicated tensorial structures .",
    "we thus wish to find the spectral representation of the integral , and we shall therefore use the cutkosky cut rules . in order to do so , we must assume that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are real , and that we are in minkowski space time .",
    "by cutting the lines comprising this @xmath15-loop diagram and , according to the rules , performing the replacement @xcite @xmath30 the spectral function is proportional to the discontinuity , @xmath31 , and it can be determined from @xmath32\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate ( [ cutk - cutrules ] ) we will work in a frame where @xmath33 .",

    "integral one must observe that the function @xmath17 comes from possible derivatives in the operator @xmath36 and that it is a lorentz scalar .",
    "it can thus only be a function of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which comes from the scalars @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "after the evaluation we can write the lorentz invariant spectral function @xmath43 by going to an arbitrary frame , whilst replacing @xmath44 .    we are ultimately interested , however , in the case where the masses involved are complex and the momenta are in euclidean space .",
    "we then consider expressions like ( [ cutk - eval ] ) as functions of real masses and minkowski momenta and will analytically continue and @xmath29 . ]",
    "it to complex mass values in euclidean momentum space .",
    "we want to draw attention here that , if we would immediately assume @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be complex , we can not apply the cut rules .",
    "we can not put an @xmath12-particle physically on - shell , or mathematically spoken , does not make much sense for @xmath45 while @xmath46 .",
    "we will now illustrate the procedure just described by computing spectral functions in different dimensionalities for the two - point function with @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to the toy model introduced in @xcite .",
    "we are thus interested in finding a spectral representation of the form @xmath48 for the following euclidean two - point function @xmath49 with conjugate masses parametrized as @xmath50 we assume that , this is immediately clear . in the context of the model of @xcite , @xmath51 itself also corresponds to the mass of another degree of freedom , as such @xmath51 is supposed to be positive . ] @xmath52 , and without loss of generality we may take @xmath53 .",

    "it is evidently out of the question to apply the standard cut rules with the foregoing propagators , since they are not even of the form @xmath234 , so the replacement rule loses its meaning .",
    "the theory of the ( stieltjes ) inversion could however be applied , albeit perhaps rather in a numerical fashion , employing stable approximations for the infinite numbers of derivatives appearing in formula .",
    "let us also mention here that in many cases , the concrete application of the cutkosky rules become intractable beyond one loop , due to the highly complicated phase space integrals .    in the particular case of bound states , like a glueball or meson , which can crucially depend on a viable input for the gluon propagator",
    ", one might imagine to use propagators of the type or to compute , in one approximation or another , suitable two - point functions , to obtain consequently an estimate for the spectral density , and then eventually use the latter as input for whatever method one likes to employ to find estimates for e.g.  bound state masses",
    ". one might think about employing laplacian sum rules as in @xcite or techniques based on pad approximants as in @xcite , to name only a few approaches to the bound state problem whereby the spectral density enters .",
    "we end by mentioning that or are quite different in the deep infrared as tends to a strictly positive constant for @xmath235 , while vanishes in the same limit .",
    "the former scenario is recovered on the lattice @xcite .",
    "one could nevertheless wonder if both solutions could reproduce more or less the same physics , as preliminary investigated in @xcite in a specific example and approximation .",
