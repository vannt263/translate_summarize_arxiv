    "the structural and electronic properties of pb on si(111 ) have been studied for almost 30 years .",
    "the initial interest was focussed on the contact between a superconductor ( pb ) and a semiconductor ( si ) . however , the rich variety of unexpected phenomena which were observed has incited research also in temperature ranges far above the superconduction transition temperature @xmath2 of pb . examples of these observations are the strong dependence of the schottky barrier on the exact atomic structure @xcite , the formation of magic height islands @xcite , anomalies in the superconductivity transition temperature @xcite , oscillations of the work function and extremely long excited state life times @xcite , and the observation of a rashba - type spin splitting @xcite .",
    "the origin of many of these phenomena lies in the peculiar electronic structure of pb on si(111 ) manifested in the high in - plane effective mass @xcite .",

    "the surface states disappear and the top of the valence band ( vb ) of si is shifted by 0.35 ev to lower binding energy from initially 2.1 ev to 1.75 ev , which is apparent from a comparison of figs .  [ edc_si7by7](a ) and ( b ) .",

    "one of the findings in this work is that also pb layers deposited on the bi interface accommodate well defined quantum well states .",
    "in a first approximation the confinement of the conduction electrons within the metal film can be treated similarly to the well - known one - dimensional particle - in - a - box model . in this model",
    "the confinement of a particle by infinite potential barriers leads to discrete energy levels with standing wave solutions having nodes exactly at the boundaries of the box .",

    "the wave function describing the particle will have a certain penetration depth into the barrier specified by a phase shift @xcite .",
    "the main difference between both approximations is that in the case of a finite barrier the penetration of the wave function will lead to a larger effective width @xmath23 of the confinement box and therefore to a lower energy of the particle since @xmath24 ( for the same quantum number ) .",
    "the description of qws as standing waves allows to apply the so - called phase accumulation model in order to calculate the energies of such electronic states @xcite .",
    "a standing wave may form when the total accumulated phase @xmath25 is an integer number @xmath7 of 2@xmath26 . here",
    "the total phase of the wave can be split into a contribution from the propagation through the overlayer @xmath27 , when the electron travels back and forth through the medium , and a phase shift upon reflection at the metal to vacuum interface @xmath28 and at the metal to substrate interface @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the intralayer spacing ( pb , @xmath32  ) and @xmath33 denotes the number of monolayers ( the thickness of the overlayer is an integral number of @xmath31 ) . in this approach the potentials at the metal to substrate and metal to vacuum interface are simply modeled as a phase shift .",
    "the exact nature of the potentials need not necessarily to be known .",

    "are lower in energy , because the effective width of the confinement box is larger . in a similar experiment",
    "@xcite the influence of the schottky barrier on the confinement of qws was investigated .",
    "qws with energies @xmath44 within the band gap of si(111 ) can not couple to any bulk states thus an electron impinging on the interface will be perfectly reflected .",

    "the other hand electronic states with energies outside the gap , commonly referred to as quantum resonances ( qr ) , give rise to broad peaks due to resonant coupling . by measuring the line width with arpes as a function of qws binding energy it is possible to determine the confinement edge @xmath37 and thus the transition from qws to qr . for the pb interface electronic states with @xmath45",

    "these findings are consistent with the determined schottky barrier , which is 0.62 ev for the pb and 0.55 ev for the in interface .",
    "to summarize , interfaces of different types of atoms have a significant influence on the phase shift of the wave function at the metal - to - substrate interface and thus on the electronic properties of qws . in this work",
    ", we will show that the interface has also an influence on structural properties of the metallic overlayer and consequently on the electronic structure .",
    "the unusual flat in - plane dispersion of pb qws on pb-@xmath15/si(111 ) is still a subject of discussion .",
    "before we present our results and discussion we will first review some previous measurements of band dispersions of pb qws on different types of interfaces .",
    "arpes is a suitable technique to investigate the in - plane dispersion @xmath47 of qws .",
    "the confinement of the states is present in the direction perpendicular to the surface whereas within the film plane the crystal can be regarded as infinite .",
    "therefore the band structure around the surface brillouin zone center ( sbzc ) @xmath48  ( @xmath49  =  0 ) is well described by a free electron gas according to @xmath50 with @xmath51 as effective mass and @xmath52 ) as the parallel momentum .",
    "it is known that the dispersion of a band can be attributed to the degree of localization of the state ; localized electronic states have less dispersion than delocalized states .",
    "the degree of localization is in simple systems related to the degree of overlap between the orbitals of which the state is composed : a small orbital overlap results in a high degree of localization and vice versa .",
    "an example of a system with almost no interaction between the substrate and the overlayer is given by pb on graphitized sic @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the qws is free electron - like with an effective mass of approximately @xmath53 ( free electron mass ) around the sbzc even for a low film thickness of 2 ml , where typically strain due to the lattice mismatch with the substrate is expected .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) slab calculations are able to reproduce the measured dispersion by assuming a free - standing pb slab . in this system",
    "the inert graphene layer decouples the influence of the substrate . on the other hand pb deposited on pb-@xmath15/si(111 )",
    "( henceforth pb / pb / si(111 ) ) is an example of a strong influence of the substrate @xcite . for coverages up to 25 ml the states around sbzc have unusually high effective masses of up to @xmath51 @xmath34 10 @xmath53 , which can not be modeled with a free - standing film assuming a bulk pb in - plane lattice constant . here",
    "we will show that the bi interface acts similarly to the graphene layer to decouple the pb overlayer from the substrate and that the dispersion increases .",
    "it will be argued that the strong in - plane localization observed in pb layers on the pb-@xmath15/si(111 ) substrate can be explained by an increased atomic spacing in the direction parallel to the surface induced by the substrate .",

    "we therefore conclude that the bi interface is stable against intermixing with pb at the low temperatures under investigation .",
    "this result is not suprising since the bonding of the bi to the si substrate lowers the surface energy by filling dangling bonds .",

    "states within the specific momentum range around @xmath77 are quantum resonances , because they are not confined within the absolute band gap of si(111 ) .",
    "the hybridization leads to a lower intensity and to a larger peak width because the reflectivity of the interface is no longer equal to one .",
    "figure [ hybridization](b ) shows edcs taken from @xmath103 @xmath78 and normalized to the maximum of intensity .",
    "red ( light grey ) edcs represent truly confined states ( qws ) with narrow line widths and blue ( dark grey ) edcs quantum resonances .",
    "also for the bi reconstructed interface a clear hybridization between the qws and the si vb is thus observed .",
    "however , the effective mass is still significantly lower compared to qws on pb-@xmath15/si(111 ) .",
    "therefore the high effective mass for pb / pb / si(111 ) can not be explained by the influence of the si vb alone .",
    "the increase of the effective mass actually occurs in the energy and momentum space which is further away from the si valence band and closer to the 6@xmath92 derived states .",
    "thus the unusual effective mass in pb / pb / si(111 ) arises from the structural and electronic properties of the pb overlayer and can be reduced by replacing the pb with a bi interface .",
    "the influence of the bi interface on the in - plane dispersion of @xmath84 derived qws has been studied with arpes and leed experiments and dft calculations .",
    "in contrast to pb / pb / si(111 ) we find : @xmath104 no effective masses larger than 4 @xmath53 and @xmath105 no significant dependence of the effective mass on the layer thickness .",
    "compared to pb / pb / si(111 ) the dispersion of @xmath84 derived states in pb / bi / si(111 ) is enhanced . with leed",
    "we could confirm that in pb / pb / si(111 ) the in - plane lattice constant of the ultra - thin film decreases with coverage in a similar manner as the effective mass .",
    "this is fully consistent with our dft calculations and the corresponding picture of orbital overlap ; the reduced overlap of the 6@xmath90 orbitals reduces the dispersion , simultaneously the band width of the 6@xmath92 derived states is reduced .",
    "together these effects alter the hybridization between the 6@xmath106 and 6@xmath92 derived bands and cause the change from electron - like to hole - like dispersion to shift to lower @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore the in - plane lattice constant of a pb film on the bi reconstructed interface is smaller compared to a film of similar coverage on the pb reconstructed interface , which is also reflected in the effective mass .",
    "these findings let us conclude that the bi interface acts as a decoupling layer between the pb and si , in the sense that the influence of the substrate on lateral atomic positions of the pb overlayer is reduced .",
    "assistance with the dft calculations by p. blaha and r. laskowski is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we thank c. hess , f. dubi , and m. klckner for technical support .",
