    "the fastest direct method available ( as order of convergence ) has been the trapezoidal trotter discrete path integral ( dpi ) method.@xcite the technique is usually derived by means of the lie - trotter product formula and an appropriate short - time high - temperature approximation . the formal asymptotic convergence of the trapezoidal trotter dpi method and of related dpi techniques was extensively studied by suzuki@xcite and was found to be @xmath16 .",
