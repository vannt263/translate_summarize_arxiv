    "motion of electrons and/or positrons across the shear surface produces the electric currents shown also in figure [ jxem ] by the arrows .",
    "relativistic jet flow is out of the page and in the @xmath146- @xmath147 case positive ( red / orange ) and negative ( blue / black ) current flows along the jet and the sheath side of the velocity shear surfaces , respectively .",
    "positive currents are stronger than the negative currents , leading to the generation of the @xmath35 magnetic field component , shown in figure [ kkhi]a - c . in the @xmath8 case , a complex current structure appears on the jet side of the velocity shear surface .",
    "the associated magnetic fields are then folded and twisted by vortical plasma motions .",
    "the vortices appear like `` islands '' in the magnetic field . in the currents it is possible to see that the transverse fluctuation scale is similar in the @xmath146- @xmath147 and @xmath8 cases , but the structures are considerably different .",
    "it seems likely that the development of transverse filamentary structure has influenced the longitudinal structure studied in section 2 . in general",
    ", we find that the kkhi grows on timescales @xmath198 , albeit growth also depends on the density ratio across the velocity shear .",
    "once particles have scattered across the velocity shear via kkhi or thermal motions , structure associated with interpenetrating relativistic plasmas can develop .",
    "for @xmath199 there is the beam space charge instability ( bludeman , watson & rosenbluth ( 1960 ) and see also eqs.(8 ) & ( 9 ) in hardee & rose ( 1978 ) ) with @xmath200 for @xmath201 there is the ordinary mode ( filamentation ) instability with @xmath202 equation ( 18 ) is formally found in the limit @xmath203 and is like eq.(11 ) in hardee & rose ( 1978 ) which assumed @xmath204 , but now with @xmath205 and allowing for @xmath206 to reveal the density dependence . we have adopted the present notation in equations ( 17 & 18 ) , and note that they were derived originally in the context of electron - positron jet and ambient plasmas .",
    "they should also apply to electron - proton plasmas where the ions are assumed infinitely massive .",
    "we see from the above that the longitudinal beam space charge instability grows on timescales @xmath198 that are comparable to the kkhi . on the other hand , filamentary structure associated with the transverse ordinary mode instability grows on timescales @xmath207 and thus can grow faster than kkhi longitudinal structure for large lorentz factors . while there is excellent agreement between observed longitudinal structure scales and theoretical prediction for the two lower lorentz factors , such is not the case for the high lorentz factor simulation . here",
    "we believe that more rapid growth of transverse structure in the high lorentz factor case has overwhelmed slower growth of the longitudinal kkhi and led to a longitudinal length scale that is less than the minimum unstable wavelength associated with the kkhi .",
    "figure [ jxbem ] shows how the @xmath145 current structure in a small @xmath192 plane square around the velocity shear surface ( see figure [ jxem ] for location ) and the magnetic field strength and position relative to the shear surfaces along 1d cuts in the @xmath52 direction change as a function of the lorentz factor for the @xmath8 cases at time @xmath208 .",
    "not presented here are the @xmath146- @xmath147 cases as they show very little change in the amplitude or the width of the amplified magnetic field region as a function of the lorentz factor .",
    "this result may indicate a difference from the theory and counter - streaming simulation results ( grismayer et al .",
    "2013a , b ; alves et al .",
    "2014 ) in which amplitude and width scaled with @xmath209 or just that our higher lorentz factor @xmath146- @xmath147 cases have not reached saturation . in the @xmath8 cases we see that the currents are located on the jet side of the shear surface for lorentz factors @xmath124 ( a ) 15 and ( b ) 5 , but are located on both sides of the shear surface for ( c ) @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum and minimum current density amplitudes are ( a ) @xmath149 , ( b ) @xmath210 , and ( c ) @xmath211 , and the maximum magnetic field strength is smaller by about an order of magnitude for the ( a ) @xmath166 case and smaller by about a factor of 3 for the ( c ) @xmath155 case compared to the ( b ) @xmath156 case .",
    "here we do find an increase in the maximum field strength from the @xmath155 case to the @xmath156 case as suggested by the theory and counter - streaming results but with a decrease in the total shear layer width instead of the expected increase in shear layer width .",
    "the @xmath166 simulation is not near saturation so can not be directly compared to the lower lorentz factor cases .",
    "however , it is clear that the increased inertia of the more relativistically moving jet plasma inhibits motion of jet electrons across the shear surface and affects the shear structure significantly compared to counter - streaming simulations in which both plasmas have the same inertia .",
    "temporal development of the total magnetic field energy shown in figure [ emevol ] shows that the still slowly growing magnetic field energy for the ( b ) @xmath156 case is comparable to the ( c ) @xmath155 case at time @xmath208 and should become greater at later times .",
    "figure [ emevol ] also shows a more rapid growth of the total magnetic field energy for the ( a ) @xmath212 case at this time .",
    "these results suggest that the differences in the current structure and the magnetic field strength and location may indicate a temporal development attributable to growth rate differences in addition to inertial differences .",
    "in fact , for the case with @xmath155 at @xmath213 the current filaments with maximum and minimum values @xmath214 are located nearer to the velocity shear than at the later time of @xmath208 shown in figure [ jxbem]c where the maximum and minimum values are @xmath215 .",
    "thus , the differences seen in figure [ jxbem ] from high to low lorentz factors may provide an indication of the temporal development of the current structure from fewer ( @xmath166 ) to more ( @xmath155 ) e - folding times .",
    "figure [ 3disos ] provides a 3d display of the currents and magnetic fields at the velocity shear surface for the @xmath8 case with @xmath124 5 at @xmath216 .",
    "the 3d display reveals current filaments with length    in the @xmath20 direction ( see figure [ jxxz]d ) much longer than the spacing in the @xmath192 plane ( see figure [ jxbem]b ) .",
    "strong positive ( red ) and negative ( blue ) current filaments wrapped by magnetic field lines seen in 3d are seen in a 2d slice shown previously in figure  [ jxbem]b ( albeit here at an earlier time ) in the @xmath20 component of the current density ( positive ( red ) and negative ( blue ) ) and magnetic field ( arrows ) in the @xmath197 plane .",
    "the positive and negative current filaments seen in 2d are now revealed to twist around each other with the longitudinal wavelength @xmath217 seen in figure [ jxxz]d and figure [ by1dz]d .",
    "the total magnetic energy isosurface shows a concentration of the magnetic field around the current filaments .",
    "figure [ figt ] provides a 3d display of the currents and magnetic fields at the velocity shear surface    for the @xmath8 cases at the same time , @xmath208 , as the 2d slices shown in figure [ jxbem ] , and also shows the current and magnetic field structure at the velocity shear surface for the @xmath146- @xmath147 case with @xmath218 . for the @xmath8 cases ,",
    "as indicated by the 2d slices , the 3d structure shows a current carrying region that thickens as the lorentz factor decreases and at low lorentz factor appears on both sides of the velocity shear surface .",
    "the 3d structure suggests a single layer of current filaments at @xmath219 that broadens to a dual layer of current filaments at @xmath218 . at @xmath220",
    "current filaments on both sides of the velocity shear layer are much less well defined . a comparison between the @xmath218 @xmath8 ( fig . [ figt]b ) and @xmath146- @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ figt]d ) cases shows the very different current and magnetic field structures at the velocity shear surface . for the @xmath146- @xmath147case ,",
    "the magnetic field is very uniform and largely confined to the velocity shear surface just below a strong positive ( red ) current sheet on the jet side . outside the velocity shear surface",
    "we see a weaker negative ( blue / green ) current sheet , and further outside a filamented weak negative ( blue / green ) current region .",
    "the structures shown in figures [ 3disos ] and [ figt ] are similar to those produced by the filamentation ( weibel - like ) instability , associated with interpenetrating plasmas ( see eq.(18 ) ) .",
    "we note that the change in structure from closely spaced current filaments of smaller diameter in a narrower region in the @xmath166 case to the merged larger - diameter and less closely spaced filaments in a broader region in the @xmath156 case shown in figures [ jxbem ] and [ figt ] is like the expected temporal development for the filamentation instability as the number of e - folding times increases . since in our simulations",
    "the @xmath221 cases have not reached saturation , one can not say with certainty that the instability will not ultimately develop the structures seen in the saturated @xmath155 case , in which the current filaments are probably fully developed by @xmath208 .",
    "however , it seems more likely that the lack of significant current structure on the outside of the velocity shear surface in the two higher lorentz factor @xmath8 cases is a direct result of the increased inertia of the relativistically moving plasma .",
    "the observed 2d and 3d structures indicate the development of longitudinal ( electrostatic two - stream ) and transverse ( weibel - like current filamentation , e.g. , nishikawa et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2009 ) plasma instabilities usually associated with interpenetrating relativistic plasmas .",
    "figure [ phasby ] shows the magnetic field components and the associated phase - space plots of electron motions in the @xmath52 direction perpendicular to the velocity shear surface .",
    "these motions produce the mixing required to trigger interpenetrating plasma instabilities .",
    "note that in @xmath146- @xmath147 cases , mixing is almost completely associated with the electrons and in @xmath8 cases both electrons and positrons participate in the mixing .",
    "the @xmath146- @xmath147 @xmath156 case at two different times illustrates the development of both the dominant @xmath35 component of the magnetic field and the plasma mixing process .",
    "the magnetic field is initially strongest at the shear surface .",
    "the magnetic field strengthens and more deeply penetrates the ambient plasma with time .",
    "slightly deeper penetration into the jet plasma also occurs with time .",
    "ambient electrons ( red dots ) with @xmath222 are moving towards and into the jet , and become more heated and penetrate deeper into the jet plasma with time .",
    "relatively cold ( note a very small thermal spread ) jet electrons ( blue dots ) with @xmath223 are moving outwards and into the ambient plasma .",
    "these jet electrons , while remaining cold , penetrate deeper into the ambient plasma with time . at the simulation times",
    "presented , the electrons are mixed in space but not yet in velocity . due to the relatively uniform dc magnetic field generated in the @xmath20 and @xmath46 directions ,",
    "the phase - space plot shows a regular structure .    in the @xmath8 @xmath156 case , the dominant @xmath35 component of the magnetic field is strongest at the shear surface and more deeply penetrates the jet plasma than the ambient plasma .",
    "note the very different location of the magnetic field in this case versus the @xmath146- @xmath147 case at the same simulation time .",
    "the electrons are less mixed spatially on the ambient side of the shear surface but with much more heating of the jet electrons than in the @xmath146- @xmath147 case . here",
    "most of the action resides on the jet side of the shear surface where the filamentation instability dominates the dynamics .",
    "both ambient and jet electrons are accelerated in the strong ac magnetic and electric fields associated with the filamentation instability .",
    "ambient electrons are more strongly heated than the jet electrons , but now there is a significant velocity mixing of the jet and ambient electrons and the ambient electrons penetrate into the jet more deeply than in the @xmath146- @xmath147 case .    just as fig .",
    "[ phasby ] shows that the particle behavior near the velocity shear for the @xmath8 and @xmath146- @xmath147 cases is significantly different , figure [ phasvx - vy ] shows that electron acceleration at the velocity shear also is significantly different in @xmath8 and @xmath146- @xmath147 cases .",
    "the @xmath224 velocity component plots show that the electrons are accelerated in parallel and perpendicular directions ( figure [ phasvx - vy]b ) in the @xmath8 case and the electrons are accelerated only in the parallel direction ( figure [ phasvx - vy]c ) in the @xmath146- @xmath147 case .",
    "similar analysis for the two other jet lorentz factors ( not shown ) shows that @xmath146- @xmath147 cases with different lorentz factor show the same parallel electron acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , there are some modest differences in the @xmath8 cases for the two other jet lorentz factors studied .",
    "these differences occur because in the @xmath155 case the ambient and jet electrons are strongly mixed across the velocity shear surface , but in the @xmath166 case , the ambient electrons are strongly mixed into the jet region , but jet electrons are only weakly mixed into the ambient plasma .",
    "this velocity and phase - space result is also revealed in figures [ jxbem ] and [ figt ] that show a development of current filament structure on both sides of the velocity shear surface for the @xmath155 case but only on one side of the velocity shear surface for the @xmath166 case . in the @xmath155 case",
    "the mixing of jet and ambient electrons on both sides of the velocity shear is accompanied by mixing in @xmath225 and acceleration in both parallel and perpendicular directions like the @xmath156 case . in the @xmath166 case ambient and jet electrons",
    "are accelerated mainly in the perpendicular direction .",
    "our simulations do not follow the kkhi significantly past the saturation phase ( see section 3.1 ) and are thus too short to allow for significant electron acceleration in the self - generated fields of the shear flow instabilities .",
    "in fact , the strongest acceleration should occur after the growth of the kkhi fully saturates and electrons can probe the long - lived turbulent electric fields in the shear region .",
    "this has been demonstrated by alves et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the electron - proton plasma , who discuss the acceleration process and estimate the maximum energy gain of an electron interacting in the electric field to be @xmath226 .",
    "acceleration to super - thermal energies is thus possible for shear flows with relativistic lorentz factors as shown by the pic simulations in alves et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in our simulations we trace the initial stages of electron acceleration .",
    "we note that the acceleration in the parallel direction observed in our @xmath146- @xmath147 simulations resemble a process of electron surfing on the electric field structures in the shear region that provides acceleration mostly in the direction of the bulk plasma flow , as indicated in alves et al .",
    "we have presented 3d pic simulations of the kinetic kelvin - helmholtz instability for both electron - positron and electron - proton plasmas .",
    "the processes studied here are of importance to the jets from agns and grbs that are expected to have velocity shears between faster and slower moving plasmas both within the jet and at the jet external medium interface . in our simulations",
    "we have studied large velocity shears with relative lorentz factors of 1.5 , 5 , and 15 .",
    "the simulations are performed in the rest frame of an ambient plasma sheath , and an appropriate lorentz transformation of the results will extend the analysis to an ambient plasma sheath of arbitrary speed .",
    "our work goes beyond the scope of earlier 2d simulations performed by liang et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ) in either the shear momentum parallel plane ( @xmath227 referred to as @xmath11 ) or the transverse plane ( @xmath192 referred to as @xmath12 ) .",
    "the full three - dimensional effects that we find here are not found in their simulations .",
    "we show that the kinetic kelvin - helmholtz instability depends on the composition of the plasma and the jet lorentz factor .",
    "the electron - proton cases generate a dc magnetic field in the shear plane , perpendicular to the relative velocity ( @xmath35 with @xmath77 ) , while on the contrary , the electron - positron cases generate ac electric and magnetic fields . in the electron - positron cases current filaments",
    "are generated similar to those found associated with the filamentation ( weibel - like ) instability . in the simulations",
    ", initial growth appears in the @xmath77 electric field component perpendicular to the velocity shear surface .",
    "this growth is followed by growth of the @xmath35 magnetic field component in the velocity shear plane transverse to the flow direction in the electron - proton cases . for the electron - positron cases ,",
    "growth is seen in both @xmath35 and @xmath38 magnetic field components as current filaments dominate the structure near the velocity shear surface . in all cases , fluctuation structure along the jet is much longer than transverse fluctuation structure . for electron - proton cases interaction and magnetic fields do not extend far from the initial velocity shear surface . for",
    "the electron - positron cases , interaction and magnetic fields extend farther from the initial velocity shear surface although they extend mostly into the jet side for higher jet lorentz factor .",
    "the velocity shear behavior of the magnetic fields should have consequences for the appearance of jets in very - high - resolution radio imaging .",
    "for a simple cylindrical geometry velocity shear case , an electron - proton jet would primarily build magnetic field in the toroidal direction at the velocity shear surface .",
    "the magnetic field would be quasi - parallel to the line of sight at the limbs of the jet for typical aspect angles @xmath228 .",
    "in contrast , a pair - plasma jet would generate sizable radial field components that are only about a factor of 2 weaker than the toroidal field .",
    "the strong electric and magnetic fields in the velocity shear zone will also be conducive to particle acceleration .",
    "our simulations are too short for definitive statements on the efficacy of the process and the resulting spectra .",
    "also , the organization of the field in compact regions will complicate the interpretation of emission spectra , and a spatially - resolved treatment of particle acceleration and transport would be mandatory for a realistic assessment , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "relativistic electrons , for example , will suffer little synchrotron energy loss outside of the thin layer of strong magnetic field .",
    "thus synchrotron emissivity will be dominated by the shear layer , and in general emissivity will depend on how efficiently electrons can flow in and out of the shear layer and be accelerated in the regions of strong magnetic field .",
    "an immediate consequence for radiation modeling is that the energy loss time of electrons can not be calculated with the same mean magnetic field that is used to compute emission spectra , because the former includes the volume filling factor of the strong - field regions .",
    "we have extended the stability analysis presented in gruzinov ( 2008 ) , alves et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and alves et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to core - sheath electron - proton plasma flows allowing for different jet core and ambient sheath electron densities @xmath229 and @xmath230 , respectively , and jet core and ambient sheath electron velocities @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively . in this analysis",
    "the protons are considered to be infinitely massive and free - streaming , whereas the electron fluid quantities and fields are linearly perturbed .",
    "not unexpectedly we find a smaller temporal growth rate for larger lorentz factors , although in the simulations the growth rate does not appear to decrease as rapidly with lorentz factor as the maximum growth rate , @xmath233 ( timescales @xmath198 ) , obtained from the longitudinal dispersion relation .",
    "it is likely that the growth of the transverse structure seen in the 3d simulations , which likely grows on timescales @xmath207 , is responsible for the difference .",
    "fluctuation wavelengths along the flow direction seen in the two lower lorentz factor simulations are of the order of the predicted fastest growing wavelengths for both electron - proton and electron - positron plasmas suggesting that the dispersion relation applies approximately even for a non - free streaming equal mass positively charged particle . on the other hand ,",
