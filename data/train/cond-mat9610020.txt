    "one question of recent interest concerns the possible breakdown of the fermi liquid in the presence of singular or even regular interactions .",
    "one example is the luttinger liquid in one spatial dimension where the quasiparticle pole is destroyed by a short - range interaction although in this case the low - energy excitation remains gapless .",
    "the existence of the luttinger liquid in higher spatial dimensions has also been proposed but is still controversial.@xcite another example is the kohn - luttinger ( kl ) effect : a fermi liquid state is unstable against one or more bcs channels in the presence of a repulsive interaction.@xcite it has been shown that a short - range repulsive interaction can induce an attractive bcs channel at large orbital angular momentum modes . in three - dimensional fermi gases ,",
    "the kohn - luttinger effect was found in the @xmath1-wave bcs channel.@xcite this notion was extended to two - dimensional fermi liquids and a weaker kl effect was also found in the @xmath1-wave channel although the effect is not visible in a second - order perturbative expansion.@xcite    however , the kl effects in isotropic fermi liquids are weak because they are found in sub - leading corrections in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense ; the resulting @xmath2 is expected to be low . for example , in three dimensions , the kl correction to the @xmath3 function is found to be @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dimensionless length scale which is taken to be a large number in the low - energy limit.@xcite but in the case of nested fermion liquids , the effect is more dramatic since the nesting gives rise to a logarithmic flow in the repulsive channel .",
    "et al._@xcite studied the kl effect in a two - dimensional hubbard model at low filling factors where the fermi surface is almost circular and found an attractive channel with @xmath6-wave symmetry , but it is also a sub - leading effect which originates from the directional property of the square lattice . in this paper",
    "we study the kl effect in two dimensions in a nested square fermi surface .",
    "the subject of this paper may be of interest in the context of the cuprate high-@xmath2 superconducting materials .",
    "the kl effect implies that an initially repulsive interaction between electrons can induce an effective attractive bcs interaction among quasiparticles lying in the thin momentum shell around the fermi surface .",
    "hence this is one possible candidate for a non - phononic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity.@xcite indeed , we find that the repulsive interaction , which naturally contains an antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange channel , favors a @xmath0-wave bcs instability .",
    "this is in accordance with expectations.@xcite    the low - energy theory of the two - dimensional hubbard model is complicated by several features of the anisotropic nested fermi surface . especially near half - filling , there are van hove singularities in addition to non - uniformity of the fermi velocities along the fermi surface . moreover , in the low - energy limit , the system is not a regular fermi liquid due to nesting .",
    "for instance , the quasiparticles are expected to have a short lifetime , @xmath7 , near the fermi surface , and the existence of a well - defined fermi surface may be questioned.@xcite to incorporate these characteristics , we introduce a low - energy theory which models the band structure of the two - dimensional hubbard model near half - filling .",
    "we make use of multidimensional bosonization@xcite to describe the low - energy properties of the model .",
    "although fermi liquid theory may break down near the fermi surface , marginal deviations from a fermi liquid are within the scope of bosonization .",
    "the rg in the bosonic basis is a suitable method to study the low - energy phases of the model since it puts all interaction channels on an equal footing .",
    "wilson s rg algorithm , which we shall make use of , consists of integrating out high - energy degrees of freedom to construct a low - energy effective theory . in a degenerate fermion system , this amounts to successively eliminating inner and outer sides of the momentum shell around the fermi surface in which the low - energy theory lies.@xcite in this paper we construct a low - energy effective theory of a nested fermion liquid by the rg procedure and then investigate the rg flow of the effective interactions in the framework of bosonization .",
    "in other words , we successively integrate out higher - energy modes of the bosonic field @xmath8 . in most cases ,",
    "this bosonized rg procedure yields results which agree with those obtained in the fermion basis .",
    "the distinct advantage of the rg treatment based on bosonization is that the existence of well - defined quasiparticles is not _ a priori _ assumed .",
    "furthermore , those interaction channels which preserve the infinite-@xmath9 symmetry@xcite on the fermi surface are exactly diagonalized at the outset.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model low - energy theory of a two - dimensional nested fermion liquid .",

    "the @xmath0-wave channel is the most important one , and we argue that below half - filling competition arises between the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",

    "the hubbard model is a convenient description of strongly correlated fermion systems . for a reliable investigation into the rg of this model , it is essential to accommodate a properly realistic band structure near the fermi surface . here",
    "we present a model low - energy theory which simulates the nested fermion system .",

    "singularities in the density of states occur at four corners of the fermi surface , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , where the fermi velocity vanishes .    turning on the on - site interaction , the rg",
    "may be used to integrate out the high - energy degrees of freedom.@xcite the resulting low - energy effective theory is expressed in terms of quasiparticles living in a narrow shell around the fermi surface of energy cutoff @xmath24 .",
    "quasiparticles may then be related to the bare fermion operators by @xmath25 where the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath26 rescales the discontinuity in the quasiparticle occupancy at the fermi surface back to 1 .",
    "the final quasiparticle weight @xmath27 can be obtained by further integrating out the remaining low - energy degrees of freedom , @xmath28 . in non - fermi liquids",
    ", @xmath27 is zero .",
    "here we stop the rg process at the energy scale @xmath29 and investigate the low - energy theory thus obtained .",
    "assuming that the weak nearest - neighbor interaction term does not alter the shape of the fermi surface or the band structure in eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) , we may linearize the spectrum of the quasiparticles : @xmath30 |~q_{\\parallel}({\\bf k})~ , \\label{renspec}\\ ] ] which is similar to eq .",

    "the difficulty with bosonizing this fermi surface is that at the four corners of the fermi surface the fermi velocities are zero and the fermi surface normal vectors are not well - defined in the vicinity of the van hove points . below half - filling , however , the van hove singularity is not encountered .",

    "this agrees with previous expectations by others who obtained the inverse lifetime of quasiparticles , @xmath7 , as a function of the temperature.@xcite since the quasiparticle weight of a marginal fermi liquid vanishes at the fermi surface as the inverse of a logarithm , the fermi liquid fixed point breaks down but the breakdown of the fermi surface is smooth enough for the bosonization and the subsequent rg procedure to be applicable.@xcite therefore we can confidently apply the rg method to analyze large - momentum channels which do not preserve infinite @xmath9-symmetry",

    "for example , we have not incorporated in the model the strong van hove singularity which is present in the cuprate materials.@xcite furthermore , the @xmath104-doped @xmath105 ( ncco ) material exhibits @xmath106 resistivity even though photoemission studies show a nested fermi surface.@xcite this suggests that nesting with the zs alone is not sufficient to account for the behavior of the resistivity in the normal states of cuprate superconductors .    in the following sections , we study large - momentum scattering channels by the perturbative rg method .",
    "we do not explicitly include the zs channel at the outset but we assume that it contributes sub - leading corrections to rg equations .",
    "for example , though bosons in different patches are correlated via the zs channel , the correlation between fermions in different patches is negligible : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the system size.@xcite also the self - energy corrections are of order @xmath109 times smaller than the leading order .",

    "there is no rotational invariance in the bcs vertex function , and so @xmath117 must be expanded in a double fourier series.@xcite consequently the fourier coefficients are coupled in the resulting rg equations , unlike in the case of a circular fermi surface .",
    "first we discuss the possible symmetry of the order parameter in a square lattice .",
    "the bcs vertex function has @xmath118 symmetry and there are five sets of basis functions which generate the two - dimensional function space to which the vertex function belongs .",

    "the sdw instability leads to an af spin - density ordering with period @xmath181 and @xmath182 since the on - site repulsive interaction induces an af exchange interaction with the nearest neighbors .",

    "in the course of this rg procedure , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are renormalized as well as the bcs channel , and so the resulting flow equation will be a complicated set of coupled differential equations .",

    "the first term in eq . ( [ crtn2 ] ) gives rg flow to all bcs symmetry channels since it has a strong wave - vector dependence .",
    "more succinctly , the rg equation of the bcs channel is given by @xmath195 if @xmath50 and @xmath103 are in the same quadrant on the fermi surface .",

    "their rate of change is evaluated as follows : @xmath201 where @xmath202 initially .",
    "these are evaluated when @xmath203 . here",
    "we find that the inequality @xmath204 holds for a sufficiently small @xmath205 . from the landau theorem",
    "we can infer that there can be a bcs instability in either the @xmath121 ( @xmath0-wave ) or @xmath120 ( eight - lobed @xmath5-wave ) channel as long as the sdw instability does not set in .",
    "furthermore , we can infer from the inequality @xmath204 that for a small enough @xmath205 , @xmath0-wave superconductivity is preferred .",
    "the reason the inequality holds is that the @xmath0-wave basis function @xmath206 has a larger overlap than @xmath207 does with the density of states at the fermi surface which peaks at the van hove points .    of course ,",
    "@xmath0-wave superconductivity is not the only possible ground state near half - filling . there is competition between the sdw and bcs instabilities since both are favored in the presence of a bare on - site repulsive interaction . slightly below half - filling ,",
    "the nesting is not perfect but nevertheless effective as long as the effective theory around the fermi surface covers a significant part of the nested fermi surface . as the energy cutoff around the fermi surface",
    "is reduced via the rg towards @xmath208 , where @xmath208 is the energy deviation of the actual fermi surface from the nested one , the sdw and af exchange channels stop flowing whereas the bcs channel continues to be renormalized logarithmically as its flow is independent of nesting.@xcite if initially the sdw coupling is small enough or if @xmath208 is large enough so that it does not develop an instability until @xmath209 , or @xmath210 , there never occurs a sdw instability .",
    "although it is difficult to compute the critical energy , the bcs instability eventually sets in at a sufficiently low - energy scale . from the argument above",
    ", the superconducting order parameter presumably has @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "this result is consistent with the expectation that af exchange channel is conducive to @xmath0-wave superconductivity and qualitatively in good agreement with the parquet solution obtained for a flat fermi surface.@xcite",
    "in this paper we investigated the bcs instability in a nested fermion liquid with a bare repulsive interaction .",
    "when the zs channel was incorporated we found that the low - energy fixed point was of a marginal fermi liquid type .",
    "although the fermi liquid state broke down , multidimensional bosonization was still applicable .",
    "large - momentum scattering channels were then included via the perturbative rg procedure in the boson basis . among the logarithmically renormalized channels , the sdw channel showed the quickest flow due to the nesting , but it had negligible overlap with the bcs channel .",
    "the other repulsive or af channels gave rise to a renormalization of the bcs couplings .",
    "we found that the @xmath0-wave channel was rendered the most attractive .",
    "close to but less than half - filling , when no instabilities develop in the sdw channel ( @xmath210 ) , a @xmath0-wave bcs instability sets in at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectations of monthoux , balatsky , and pines,@xcite and the result obtained by zhelenyak , yakovenko , and dzyaloshinskii.@xcite    the procedure presented in this paper is useful for extracting information about the low - energy fixed points of lattice systems .",
    "once a realistic band structure of the system near the fermi surface is given as the input , one can analyze the phase structure and the order parameter symmetry at low temperatures .",
    "as regards the cuprate superconductors , it would be interesting to study the rg of a three - band hubbard model . for a detailed examination of the low - temperature phase structure of the materials , numerical works on the rg equation",
    "are needed . in this manner",
