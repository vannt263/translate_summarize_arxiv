    "the nuclear collective motion is one of the central problems of nuclear structure physics . in the nuclear shell model",
    ", a medium - heavy nucleus has many valence particles and these particles move collectively in a large single - particle space .",
    "because such a collective motion is dominated by quadrupole correlations , the corresponding states are referred to as the quadrupole collective states .",
    "it is of great interest how such quadrupole collective states are formed as one sails to more exotic regimes on the nuclear chart . to explore this , a plausible approach is to adopt a hamiltonian confirmed for its validity in and near stable regimes and apply it to unknown regimes .",
    "as such an attempt , in this paper , we shall discuss the structure of exotic te isotopes with the neutron number ( @xmath4 ) exceeding 82 .",
    "because the proton number ( @xmath5 ) is 52 in te isotopes and there are two valence protons with respect to the @xmath5=50 closed core , there should be certain proton - neutron correlations in such te isotopes .",
    "a recent quantitative assessment of their structure , however , shows rather peculiar tendencies as will be presented .",

    "certain basic properties of the quadrupole collective states can be well described empirically by simple phenomenological models .",
    "for example , the systematic relation between the excitation energy of the first @xmath6 state , @xmath7 , and the e2 transition strength from the ground @xmath8 state to the first @xmath6 state , i.e. , @xmath9 , has been studied well @xcite .",
    "one of such useful formulas for this relation is the modified grodzins rule @xcite , which is written as : @xmath10 where @xmath7[kev ] , @xmath5 , and @xmath11 denote the excitation energy of @xmath12 state , the atomic number , and the mass number , respectively .",
    "it has been confirmed @xcite that a family of the grodzins rule is extremely successful .",
    "another approach of the phenomenological relation can be found in the systematic relation between the above @xmath13 value and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the numbers of valence protons and neutrons , respectively @xcite .",
    "particularly , it has been stressed in @xcite that this @xmath13 value can be given quite well as a function of the quantity @xmath17 . since this @xmath17 rule is quite robust in nuclei on and near the @xmath18-stability line",
    ", it is of great interest whether or not this @xmath13 value still follows this rule , also in exotic nuclei far from the @xmath18-stability line .",
    "while such empirical rules are successful to a good extent , an exception has emerged in an experiment which extended the experimental feasibility .",

    "equation ( [ eq : wftezero ] ) implies that the @xmath45 state is accounted for by the state @xmath75 up to 83 % in probability .",
    "moving to the first @xmath6 state , eq.([eq : wftefirsttwo ] ) indicates that the probability of the component @xmath76 is larger by a factor of about four than that of @xmath77 .",
    "this asymmetry is rather unusual for the first @xmath6 state of nuclei with open shells for protons and neutrons ; strong proton - neutron couplings mix protons and neutrons more equally in other usual ( maybe stable ) nuclei , giving rise to a more symmetric superposition .",
    "figure  [ fig : sntelevels ] ( b ) shows that the excitation energy of the @xmath58 state measured from @xmath78 is 0.76 mev , which is about 0.45 kev lower than the excitation energy ( 1.21 mev ) of the @xmath59 relative to the @xmath79 state . the origin of the above asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wftefirsttwo ] ) is nothing but this difference in the excitation energies of @xmath59 and @xmath58 . if the proton - neutron correlation is strong enough , such a difference",
    "is overcome , and protons and neutrons move in coherent manners as is the case , for instance , with heavier ba isotopes with the same hamiltonian @xcite . however , because of fewer valence nucleons , this is not the case in @xmath1te , and the difference between proton and neutron remains crucial , yielding the asymmetry in the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wftefirsttwo ] ) .",
    "the small excitation energy of the @xmath58 state is clearly due to the weaker monopole pairing between neutrons ( @xmath80 mev ) than the pairing between protons ( @xmath81 mev ) .",
    "although the quadrupole pairing interaction follows the same trend and the difference in the monopole pairing is partly canceled by the quadrupole pairing , the @xmath58 state is still lower than the @xmath59 state .",
    "this asymmetry in eq.([eq : wftefirsttwo ] ) decreases the proton - neutron coherence in the e2 transition from the ground to the @xmath12 state , resulting in a weaker e2 transition .",
    "in addition , the dominant weight of the @xmath76 state makes the @xmath13 value further smaller because of the small effective charge ( 0.6@xmath82 ) for neutrons .",
    "thus , @xmath19 value becomes @xmath83 [ e@xmath21b@xmath21 ] for @xmath1te .",
    "this value is larger than the @xmath24te value only by a rather modest factor , about 1.5 , consistently with the experimental observation .",

    "the difference of wave function contents between the 6@xmath3 and 8@xmath3 states should be the origin of the almost vanishing @xmath91 transition between them .",
    "the structure of the @xmath71 state is quite interesting . equation ( [ eq : wftesecondtwo ] ) shows that this state contains considerable amount of the @xmath77 state as well as @xmath76 with the opposite signs .",
    "the state @xmath92 is clearly anti - symmetric with respect to interchanges between proton pairs and neutron pairs , and is called a mixed - symmetry state @xcite . although the mixed - symmetry states are defined with the ibm-2 , the bosons and the collective pairs can be mapped onto each other @xcite , and the concept of the mixed - symmetry states will be used in this context . the @xmath71 state ( @xmath93 in eq . ( [ eq : wftesecondtwo ] ) ) is dominated by this mixed - symmetry state up to 65 % .",
    "its excitation energy is about 1.5 mev , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : teall ] ( c ) decreases from @xmath24te to @xmath1te .",
    "this happens because the @xmath12 wave function is dominated by @xmath134 , whereas only @xmath135 can be excited by the proton quadrupole transition from @xmath136 . in this picture",
    ", the proton matrix element can be about a half of that of @xmath1te , because of the small amplitude of @xmath135 component in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wftefirsttwo ] ) .",
    "the decrease is , however , only by about 20 % , owing to re - arrangements of other minor components of the @xmath45 and @xmath12 wave functions so as to enhance quadrupole collectivity .",
    "the proton contribution increases only modestly as a function of @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig : teall ] ( c ) . the @xmath13 value of te isotopes increases mainly due to the increase of the neutron matrix element as the `` spherical @xmath16 effect '' mentioned above .",
    "thus , the evolution of the collectivity / deformation in te isotopes is mainly due to neutron part of the wave function .",
    "the proton part seems to be saturated already at @xmath1te .",
    "the evolution driven only by neutrons seems to be rather slow .",
    "in fact , one can compare the growth of the @xmath13 value of te isotopes to that of ba isotopes shown in fig .",
    "[ be2all ] .",
    "the @xmath13 of ba isotopes grows so rapidly that it overscales fig .",
    "[ fig : teall ] ( b ) .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that both proton and neutron wave functions undergo the phase transition from the spherical to deformed intrinsic structures in ba isotopes , and _ both _ proton and neutron matrix elements become larger as the neutron number approaches 90 . on the other side ,",
    "both proton and neutron wave functions remain basically spherical in te isotopes and the evolution reflects only the `` spherical @xmath16 effect '' .",
    "figure [ fig : teall](d ) shows g - factors of the @xmath12 state of sn and te isotopes",
    ". the g - factor of te isotopes shows a weak tendency to the collective value , @xmath137 @xcite , or ibm-2 value , @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "the structure of an exotic nucleus @xmath1te and its vicinity has been studied by the shell model , using the mcsm technique .",
    "the unusually small value of @xmath1te @xmath100 has been explained without any adjustment .",
    "based on weak proton - neutron coupling in @xmath1te , mixed - symmetry properties are discussed , proposing this nucleus as an excellent play ground for this subject . we also provide with predictions of te isotopes beyond @xmath1te .",
    "the evolution of the collective motion as a function of the neutron number may be rather different from that in more stable nuclei , and a slow growth of the collectivity is predicted , which deviates from empirical predictions .",
    "the calculations for heavier te isotopes are already huge , and have been carried out by the mcsm .",
