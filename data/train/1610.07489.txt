    "we are interested in rg flows in two - dimensional euclidean quantum field theories .",
    "we will look at flows that originate in a uv fixed point described by a 2d @xmath0 and arrive at an ir fixed point described by a @xmath1 which may be trivial if a mass gap develops along the flow .",
    "the flows are triggered by perturbations of @xmath0 by relevant operators @xmath2 .",
    "in general it is a hard non - perturbative problem to determine the infrared properties of the perturbed theory , in particular to identify @xmath1 when it is non - trivial .",
    "a technique that allows one to investigate the perturbed theories numerically in the infrared including the flows to non - trivial fixed points is the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) invented in @xcite .",
    "the basic setup of tcsa is as follows .    in order not to worry about perturbative infrared divergences we put the perturbed theory on a cylinder with spacial periodic coordinate @xmath3 and euclidean time @xmath4 directed along the axis of the cylinder . in the hamiltonian formalism",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are scaling dimensions of @xmath0 shifted by @xmath10 .",
    "since the state space @xmath11 of the unperturbed theory on a cylinder is discrete @xmath12 can be represented by an infinite matrix acting in this space . to regulate the uv divergences we can truncate @xmath12 to a finite matrix by restricting it to a finite dimensional subspace in @xmath11 .",
    "this gives rise to a variety of truncated hamiltonian techniques in which one numerically calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the truncated hamiltonian matrix for various values of the scale set by the circle length @xmath13 . in tcsa",
    "the truncated subspace is specified by imposing an upper bound on the scaling dimensions of the allowed states .",
    "this upper bound is called the truncation level .",
    "the uv divergences show up in the dependence of numerics on the truncation level .",
    "this dependence and various improvement techniques have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "tcsa has been applied to situations in which a perturbed theory arrives to a non - trivial fixed point ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in this case the dimensionless energy eigenvalues @xmath14 at large @xmath13 asymptote to constant values that give scaling dimensions in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover the asymptotic eigenvectors that correspond to scaling states @xmath15 in @xmath1 are obtained as vectors in the truncated subspace of @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding components of @xmath16 give us pairings [ tcsa_pairing ] i | v_j between scaling states in both cft s .",

    "a conformal interface @xmath17 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be described ( via the folding trick @xcite ) as a conformal boundary condition in the tensor product @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are scaling fields in the two theories then we can define a pairing [ conf_pairing ] _ uvi |j_ir = _ i^uv _ j^ir _ i as a disc one - point function with boundary condition @xmath17 .",
    "such pairings are canonically normalised by means of cardy constraint @xcite .    in tcsa",

    "this has many manifestations such as haag s theorem , orthogonality catastrophe , inequivalent representations of canonical commutation relations , etc ( see @xcite for a nice exposition and discussion ) .",
    "typically however the problem is with the norm of the perturbed states in interaction representation which is formally infinite , while the component ratios such as ( [ gen_rat ] ) are well defined .    to show that the pairing ( [ tcsa_pairing ] ) and ratios ( [ gen_rat ] ) associated with an rg flow arise from a particular local conformal interface we discuss states in lagrangian formalism using wave functionals .",

    "the functionals describing excited states can be obtained by inserting local operators at positions with @xmath27 inside the above functional integral .",

    "we can extend this pairing to excited states of the deformed theory by inserting into the functional integral ( [ perturbed_psi ] ) additional local operators .",
    "this gives a pairing between the states in the two theories .",
    "in particular if we follow the perturbed theory to the ir fixed point we obtain a pairing of the type ( [ tcsa_pairing ] ) .",

    "the case of large positive @xmath4 can be understood in terms of boundary rg flows ( see the discussion in section [ massive_summary ] ) .",
    "this regime corresponds to starting with a large @xmath88 and adding to it a small imaginary magnetic field perturbation .",
    "thus with a good approximation we start with a vacuum described by the conformal boundary condition @xmath60 and the perturbation is just the identity field between the two boundary conditions multiplied by an imaginary coupling .",
    "the only effect of this is a relative phase factor which keeps rotating as we change the scale but does not change any physical quantities .",
    "we have also checked numerically the region @xmath259 .",
    "as long as the vacuum complex pair does not experience collisions with upper level eigenvalues the picture is qualitatively the same as presented on the above plots .",
    "such collisions are sensitive to the truncation level so strictly speaking we do not have a proof that the above picture remains in the extreme @xmath252 asymptotics at infinite truncation level .",

    "for @xmath73 numerical studies @xcite show that the vacuum energy remains real until a large positive value if @xmath149 . the latter value at which the vacuum eigenvalue collides with the first excited eigenvalue and forms a conjugate pair is numerically the larger the larger @xmath144 is and presumably such collision is a numerical artefact .",
    "we found that tffsa method works much better than tcsa in this regime .",
    "in particular the lowest eigenvalue stays real for much larger value of @xmath149 when using the tffsa method .",
    "we start discussing the numerical results for this region by taking a large negative @xmath4 where the vacuum energy stays real for large @xmath149 s and where we can use the boundary rg picture discussed in section [ massive_summary ] .",

    "the vacuum component of @xmath273 vanishes linearly at @xmath274 that is @xmath275 .",

    "since we do not know how the effective boundary @xmath270 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath149 we can not match the two curves for @xmath262 ( they are parameterised differently ) .",
    "however we can still match quantitatively the two special values : @xmath278 - the minimal value and @xmath279 - the value at the point at which @xmath264 blow up .",
    "the numerical tffsa values : @xmath280 , @xmath281 are approximately 1.573 and 2.044 respectively .",
    "these values are within few percent from those predicted by the boundary magnetic field model .",
    "the match gets better for larger values of @xmath282 and larger @xmath144 .    in the numerics for @xmath260",
    "the data continues past the blow up point @xmath283 with @xmath262 continuing to grow . in the boundary magnetic field model going past the first special point @xmath284",
    "the ratio @xmath262 blows up at @xmath285 . in the numerics we do not quite get to that second point as the vacuum and the first excited energy levels collide and form a complex pair .",
    "the collision point is sensitive to the truncation level @xmath144 and is moved towards larger values of @xmath149 as @xmath144 is increased .",
    "so presumably in the untruncated theory the vacuum remains real at all scales .",
    "as explained at the beginning of section [ complex_vac_sec ] as long as the vacuum energy remains real and @xmath179 does not vanish ( and thus remains imaginary ) we can not approach a local conformal boundary condition .",
    "so , what happens",
    "? given a good match at the onset of the flow with the imaginary boundary magnetic field model we are going to rely on it in describing what happens as we continue increasing the scale .",
    "as we can clearly see from ( [ b_state_chat ] ) the model keeps going through a sequence of special points at which @xmath286 is a ( positive ) integer or half integer . at half",
    "integer points @xmath287 all boundary state components with level less than @xmath288 in the ns sector vanish and in the higher weight components only those including @xmath289 oscillators survive . for @xmath79 large the low energy components in the r - sector approach those of the @xmath175 ishibashi state . at integer points @xmath290 similarly the low energy components in the r - sector are wiped out while those in the ns - sector approach those of the @xmath291 ishibashi states combination .",

    "thus as @xmath292 goes to infinity we will see a never ending rotation of the two combinations of ishibashi states .",
    "this cyclic behaviour is of course in violation of @xmath293-theorem which however is possible here because we are in a non - unitary situation .      at any real value of @xmath54",
    "the ising field theory flows to a trivial fixed point . for pure imaginary @xmath54 with a certain value of the scaling parameter @xmath67 the theory flows to the yang - lee fixed point which is a non - unitary minimal model @xmath68 with central charge @xmath294 .",
    "it has two primary fields : the identity and a field @xmath295 with scaling dimension @xmath296 and correspondingly two conformal boundary conditions with cardy states @xmath297 .",

    "since a magnetic perturbation is present on the ising to yang - lee trajectory we expect a non - vanishing @xmath106-component in the vacuum .",
    "this means that there are essentially two types of candidates for the ising - yang - lee rg interface - the factorised defects @xmath315 and the non - factorisable defects corresponding to @xmath316 .",
    "note that the pair @xmath316 forms a doublet under @xmath317 spin reversal symmetry so that there is essentially one non - factorizable candidate interface . to determine the index @xmath149 one would need to know other ratios of one - point functions e.g. the ratio = i ( ) ^3/4 , = -i ( ) ^1/4 which is independent of @xmath313 .",
    "however this requires knowing how the ising eigenvector @xmath318 is realised in the yang - lee state space that is inaccessible by tcsa method which only gives the infrared theory eigenvectors in the uv theory space . in the next section",
    "we will argue that the rg interface for the ising to yang - lee flow does not asymptote to any single conformal interface .    as a final remark about the conformal interfaces considered in this section we note that using the cardy constraint we can also find the spectrum of interface fields .",
    "we found that all interfaces contain relevant fields ( and are thus unstable ) except for the factorizable ones : @xmath319 .",
    "the approach to a non - trivial fixed point at @xmath67 is marked by the appearance of a `` nose '' on the plot of dimensionless energies @xmath320 depicted below : the vacuum and the first excited level energies get asymptoticaly close without collision .",
    "the relative energies @xmath321 level to constant values equal to the conformal dimension difference @xmath322 .",
    "we find numerically ( see the second graph below ) that at truncation level @xmath199 the difference @xmath323 levels at the value @xmath324 while @xmath325 approaches @xmath326 .",
    "these values approximate the dimension gaps for the yang - lee operators @xmath45 and @xmath327 respectively ( the lowest dimension state is @xmath295 with dimension -0.4 ) .",
    "[ nose ]    , @xmath199 . ]    , @xmath199 . ]    for the truncation level @xmath180 we find numerically that the lowest two levels merge into a complex pair at @xmath328 .",
    "looking at the behaviour at different values of @xmath159 we find that the merging point moves to higher @xmath149 as we increase @xmath144 .",
    "so as in the case @xmath66 such a merger seems to be merely a finite precision artefact which however limits the domain of @xmath149 we can investigate numerically .    in the previous section we found explicitly the component ratios @xmath264 , @xmath329 for all conformal interfaces between the critical ising and yang - lee models ( see formulai ( [ interfaceg1 ] ) , ( [ interfaceg2 ] ) ) .",
    "crucially all possible values are real while , as discussed in section [ complex_vac_sec ] , for as long as an eigenvalue ( vacuum or excited ) stays real the corresponding ratio @xmath249 is real and @xmath248 is imaginary .",
    "this leaves us with two possibilities : _ either the limiting conformal interface does not exist as in the case of massive flows discussed before , or the rg interface approaches a conformal interface with _ @xmath330 ( i.e. an interface symmetric under spin reversal ) .",
    "the numerical data for the component ratios of the vacuum and the first two excited states is shown on the graphs below .     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]     at @xmath67 , @xmath199 . ]",
    "we see that the ratios for the vacuum and the first excited level each behave qualitatively very similar to the vacuum ratios for the massive flows discussed in section [ im_massive ] .",
    "the ratios @xmath264 blow up near @xmath331 while @xmath329 blow up near @xmath332 . in each case",
    "the ratios @xmath261 , @xmath333 remain finite and increasing functions past the blow up points .",
    "the ratios @xmath334 while remaining finite do not show any tendency to level at a constant value . while we can not say with certainty that the oscillations between the blow up points will continue everything points towards the non - convergent oscillatory scenario .",
    "in addition to this numerical indications we would like to remark that the alternative scenario in which we approach a conformal interface symmetric under spin reversal would be very hard to envisage from a general point of view .",
    "clearly at large distances the magnetic field perturbation dominates and it breaks this symmetry .",
    "in this paper we showed how pairings between states arising in rg interfaces of @xcite can be calculated numerically using truncated hamiltonian techniques . as illustrated by the exactly solvable case of the ising model with zero magnetic case in order to read off the numerical values of the pairings ( or rather their ratios ) one needs to go to very large values of dimensionless couplings . at these values",
    "one can not a priory trust any results .",
    "perturbative corrections are organised in ratios of couplings to the truncation energy and are very large in this region .",
    "some aberrations in the low - lying spectrum that one can easily spot are the non - linearity of the vacuum energy dependence on scale and non - constance of the mass gap : @xmath335 . these can be easily spotted in the tcsa sample of data presented on the plots below .",
    "the tffsa vacuum energy behaves much better even at very large scales @xmath181 .",
    "the vacuum energy remains linear with a very good accuracy ( regression variance is about 0.01 ) .",
    "the mass gap calculated using tffsa deviates from constant at big enough @xmath149 but the deviation is significantly smaller than in the tcsa data .",
    "this means that in general we can not trust the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors for such large values of scale , and yet our numerical results ( both tcsa and tffsa ) indicate that ratios of low lying components of the vacuum eigenvector are well behaved at large scales and the non - perturbative errors for them remain well bounded .",
    "this suggests that although we need to go to very large scales to read off the asymptotic values , these quantities are more robust against truncation errors than the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors as a whole .",
    "at the moment we have no conceptual understanding of this fact which is crucial for the tcsa scheme to work for calculating the ir asymptotics of component ratios .",
    "perturbative corrections also need to be understood as well with a suitable quantitative method for their incorporation needs to be worked out .",
    "another important issue that needs further understanding is renormalisation of wave functionals . as discussed in the introduction in some cases additional boundary counter terms",
    "may be needed to renormalise wave functionals in the interaction picture .",
    "this may occur when vector fields are present in the ope of the perturbing operators . in the bulk perturbation such terms",
    "do not need any counter terms due to rotational symmetry but from the point of view of the boundary they are scalars and may lead to additional divergences for collisions at the boundary ( where rotational symmetry is broken ) .",
    "such counter terms are local along the boundary but what is their manifestation in the hamiltonian formalism ( and tcsa ) is not clear .",
    "there is a good chance , in our opinion , that for superrenormalisable perturbations the above conceptual issues do not impede using the raw tcsa data for identifying rg interfaces and rg boundaries .",
    "it would be interesting to explore systematically other examples such as the tricritical ising model or potts model .",
    "for the tricritical ising model there are 4 relevant operators and 6 elementary conformal boundary conditions",
    ". it would be interesting to find out how the three - dimensional space of massive flows breaks up into regions according to their rg boundaries .",
    "also a conformal interface for the rg flow from the tricritical ising to the critical ising was put forward in @xcite .",
