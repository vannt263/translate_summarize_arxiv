    "the investigation of magnetic nanomaterials is important part of nanoscience and exerts influence on progress in different sectors of technology ( such as medicine devices for therapy and diagnostics , @xcite magnetic data storage systems,@xcite etc ) . in the presence of intrinsic magnetic moment scientists",
    "can change a physical properties of nanomaterials by applying external magnetic field .",
    "the technological applications of magnetic nanomaterials should base on an accurate control of the coupling between individual spins .",
    "recently , hirjibehedin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported the fabrication of mn nanoparticles in the form of linear chains that display truly collective quantum behaviour . using local spin - excitation spectroscopy technique , based on inelastic scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) ,",
    "they were able to show how the quantum properties of this system depend on the number of atoms involved .",
    "they demonstrated an innovative method to measure and control these magnetic interactions .",
    "the experimental spectrum was analyzed using the simplest form of heisenberg model with exchange interaction only between nearest neighbors",
    ". however , there are a number of experimental results which can not be explained by authors of ref . using the heisenberg model : ( i ) zero - field splitting which grows in energy with increasing chain length , ( ii ) the different zero - field energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 excited states and ( iii ) asymmetry of the spectra with respect to voltage polarity .",
    "jones and lin @xcite have applied gga+u approach to describe the electronic and magnetic structures of single and pair of mn atoms on the cun(100 ) surface .",
    "the performed spin - density analysis shows that mn atoms on such surface preserve their atomic spins @xmath2 .",
    "this result agrees with stm measurement.@xcite electron - density change and surface relaxation due to mn atoms are also analyzed in ref ..    the combination of experimental stm approach and theoretical _ ab - initio _ methods",
    "@xcite has been used in order to describe the large magnetic anisotropy of individual mn and fe atoms on the cun surface .",
    "the authors of the paper @xcite have provided the detailed phenomenological picture of magnetic anisotropy and concluded that in case of manganese system the easy axis is oriented out - of - plane .    in this paper",
    "we show that the local distortion of the system results in a superexchange interaction between mn atoms through n atoms .",
    "isotropic exchange interactions are calculated using green functions approach and total energies difference method .",
    "using full diagonalization of heisenberg hamiltonian with calculated isotropic exchange integrals we estimate the energies of first magnetic excitations .",
    "the results are in good agreement with experimental data .    in the previous theoretical investigations a non - collinear magnetic ground state for nanostructures on non - magnetic surfaces",
    "@xcite and magnetic @xcite were proposed .",
    "for instance , the results for the non - collinear triangular compact trimer of cr on the au(111 ) @xcite predict that the angle between each pair of moments equals to 120@xmath3 and the total spin moment is zero .",
    "therefore , the non - collinearity is result of frustration of magnetic interactions .    in the paper",
    "@xcite authors have investigated different geometries of fe , mn and cr atoms on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the fe clusters were found to be ferromagnetically ordered . whereas for the mn and cr clusters an antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between nearest neighbours have been found .",
    "the antiferromagnetic couplings produce either collinear or non - collinear magnetic structures due to frustration of cluster geometry .",
    "an interesting results for the trimer and tetramer configurations of mn and cr atoms on the magnetic ni(111 ) surface were obtained in the paper .",
    "@xcite one should stressed that there are two types of a magnetic frustration : ( i ) frustration within adcluster and ( ii ) frustration arising from competing magnetic interactions between the adclusters and the surface atoms .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the only known source for spin non - collinearity of magnetic clusters on nonmagnetic 3d surface is geometrical frustration which results in magnetic frustration . in this paper",
    "we propose a new source of spin non - collinearity for nanosystems on a surface . according to our calculations a local distortion between mn atoms in the nanochain results in the strong dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "an important role plays the displacement of n atom from the surface . based on first - principle calculations of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions between magnetic moments we point out that the mn nanochains on the cun demonstrate a weak ferromagnetism phenomenon .",
    "we have estimated the value of a net magnetic moment and direction of spin canting .",
    "these results are also confirmed by direct lda+u+so calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the methods of the investigation . in section iii a and iii b we present the results of lsda and lda+u calculations , respectively .",
    "the analysis and comparison of obtained exchange interactions with experimental data are presented in section iii c. section iv is devoted to the analysis of zero - field energy splitting observed in stm experiment and in section v we briefly summarize our results .",
    "we have used two complementary approaches for investigations of an electronic and magnetic properties of mn nanochains on the cun surface .",
    "\\(i ) first - principles total - energy and force calculations were carried out using the projected augmented - wave ( paw ) method @xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) .",
    "@xcite exchange and correlation effects have been taken into account using lsda and lda+u @xcite approaches . in all cases under investigation we used an energy cutoff of 400 ev in the plane - wave basis construction and the energy convergence criteria of @xmath4 ev .",
    "the atomic positions of considered systems were relaxed with residual forces less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "for the brillouin zone integration , a ( 4x4x1 ) monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite and gaussian - smearing approach with @xmath5 ev were used .    to simulate structure of the unit cell",
    "we have used a supercell approach .",
    "structure of the supercell has consisted of two - layer ( 2 @xmath6 ( n+1 ) ) cu(100 ) surface , n atoms embedded into upper cu - layer , @xmath7-chains placed on the top of the cun - surface and vacuum region of 10  .",
    "lattice constant for cu was chosen to be 3.63  , which gives a minimal value of the total energy in calculation of the bulk fcc cu .",
    "lower layer of cu has been fixed under relaxation .",
    "\\(ii ) we have also used the tight binding linear - mufin - tin - orbital atomic sphere approximation ( lmto ) method @xcite in terms of the conventional local density approximation taking into account the on - site coulomb interaction lda+u and spin - orbit coupling lda+u+so .",
    "@xcite in this type of calculations we have used the relaxed structures obtained by paw approach .",
    "the radii of atomic spheres were r(mn)=1.137  , r(cu)=1.322   and r(n)=0.793  . in order to fill the empty space of the unit cell required number of empty spheres were added .",
    "the main aim of our investigation is first - principle determination of parameters of the following spin hamiltonian : @xmath8 where heisenberg @xcite energy term is @xmath9 and dzyaloshinskii - moriya @xcite energy term is @xmath10 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to calculate the isotropic exchange interactions j@xmath11 , in eq.(2 ) between magnetic moments of mn atoms we have used two different approaches .",
    "( i ) the total energy difference method on the basis of paw results .",
    "the main idea of this method is that the isotropic exchange interaction defines through the energy differences between different magnetic configurations .",
    "for instance , in case of mn - dimer , spin hamiltonian of the system can be written in the following form : @xmath12 the corresponding total energies of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations of two classical spins are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 therefore , the exchange interaction @xmath15 is expressed in the following form : @xmath16 ( ii ) from the other hand , based on lmto results one can calculate the isotropic exchange integrals and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions between magnetic moments of mn atoms ( s=@xmath17 ) using the local force theorem and green functions formalism @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) is magnetic quantum number and the on - site potential @xmath23 .",
    "the green function is calculated in the following way : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is a component of the _ n_-th eigenstate , e@xmath26 is the corresponding eigenvalue and @xmath27 is quasimomentum in the first brillouin zone .    in turn",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , eq.(3 ) can be calculated through the account of spin - orbit coupling in the second variation of total energy of the system over the small deviations of magnetic moments from the collinear ground state : @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is spin - orbit coupling constant for site @xmath31 . here",
    "we present only @xmath32 component of dzyaloshinskii - moriya vector . @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "components can be obtained from the @xmath32 ones by rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "we have performed lsda calculation of antiferromagnetic mn - dimer supported on the cun surface .",
    "fig.[dimer_lsda ] shows the relaxed structure of the mn - dimer obtained within lsda method using paw approach .",
    "the information about structure of relaxed system is presented in table i. one can see that mn - n - mn bond angle of 171@xmath3 is close to 180@xmath3 and corresponds to the maximum of superexchange interaction between 3d atoms .",
    "the calculated total and partial densities of states obtained using paw approach are presented in fig .",
    "[ dos_lsda ] .",
    "the valence band contains low and high energy parts which are separated by 6 ev .",
    "the low energy states located around -15 ev are mainly n ones . in the region from -7 ev to 5 ev all states are highly mixed .",
    "the calculated values of magnetic moments of mn atoms within lmto and paw approaches are 3.70 @xmath35 and 3.35 @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than experimentally observed spin @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the calculated exchange parameter @xmath37 within green functions approach , eq.(8 ) is 20.4 mev , whereas total energies difference method value , eq.(7 ) is 24.8 mev .",
    "these values at least three times larger than that experimentally observed .",
    "thus , one can see that the main electronic and magnetic properties of the investigated nanosystem can not be correctly reproduced within the lsda approach .",

    "green arrows correspond to direction of atomic magnetic moments of manganese.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=33.0% ]    the results of the previous section have demonstrated drawbacks of the lsda approach to describe the magnetic properties of the mn dimer on the cun surface .",
    "it is well known problem of local density approximation in respect to transition metal compounds . to overcome this problem",
    "we have used the lda+u approach with on - site coulomb and on - site hunds interaction parameters of @xmath38=6.0 ev and @xmath39=0.9 ev , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with recent first - principle estimations performed in the work .",
    "@xcite    the relaxed structures of the mn - chains of different lengths ( n=1 @xmath40 4 ) obtained within paw calculations are shown in fig.[structures ] .",
    "the structural information is presented in table [ struct ] .",
    "the obtained structures have some interesting geometrical features .",
    "let us analyze the difference between the clean cun - substrate and the substrate with mn adatoms on the top .",
    "presence of mn atoms causes some rearrangement of upper layer atoms of cun - substrate .",
    "generally , this rearrangement concerns the n atoms .",
    "in contrast to clean - cun surface , the n atoms of the system with mn nanochains are significantly shifted from the first layer plane .",
    "this fact agrees with results of recent gga calculations .",
    "@xcite the calculated angle of mn - n - mn bond within lda+u approximation equals to @xmath41 .",
    "the n atoms at the edges of chains also have some displacement from the plane in z - direction , but to a smaller extent than n atoms situated inside the chain .        from a geometrical point of view",
    "the important difference between results of lsda and lda+u approaches is the angle of mn - n - mn bond .",
    "let us analyze this fact on the level of hopping integral . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is the only strong hopping between orbitals of two 3d atoms .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is angle of metal - ligand - metal bond .",
    "therefore , within lda+u approach the hopping integral is strongly suppressed due to local coulomb correlations . in turn",
    "the isotropic exchange interaction between mn atoms in the atomic limit of hubbard model can be expressed as @xmath45 , here @xmath38 is on - site coulomb integral .",
    "it is clear that on - site coulomb interaction is another source of suppression of the isotropic exchange interaction in lda+u in comparison with lsda approach .",
    "the total and partial densities of states of the dimer and trimer systems obtained using lda+u approximation are presented in fig.[dos_ldapu2 ] and [ dos_ldapu3 ] , respectively .",
    "the calculated value of magnetic moment are listed in table [ values ] .",
    "one can see that the values of magnetic moments of mn atoms within the chains varies from 4.34 @xmath36 ( middle atoms ) to 4.47 @xmath36 ( edge atoms ) and now is much closer to experimental values of @xmath2 . in the case of lmto results",
    "this difference is much smaller .",
    ".structural information about alignment mn and n atoms on the cu(100 ) surface as result of relaxation in cases of lsda and lda+u approaches .",
    "the values are distance ( in  ) between mn atoms , @xmath32-coordinates of mn atoms and n atoms at the center and edge of chain , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 is angle of mn - n - mn bond .",
    "zero level of z coordinate corresponds to the lower layer of cu atoms .",
    "all values are given in  . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to experiment the zero - field energies of excited states are @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 mev for @xmath1 and @xmath48 , respectively , and correspond to @xmath49 mev .",
    "one can see that the theoretically estimated values of @xmath50 ( table [ en_diff ] ) give the correct order of magnitude for experimental zero - field energy splitting .",
    "we plan to investigate the effect of single - ion magnetic anisotropy energy on this splitting .",
    "we have performed first - principle investigations of electronic and magnetic structures of the mn nanochains supported on the cun surface .",
    "relaxation effects have taken into consideration .",
    "the calculated isotropic exchange integrals are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "we have also calculated the anisotropic exchange interactions in the system and predicted the antiferromagnetic ground state with weak ferromagnetism .",
    "we stress that the main source of this phenomenon is local distortion which breaks the inversion symmetry between mn atoms .",
    "it follows that the relaxation effects are important for the system under consideration .",
    "the calculated values of canting angles are larger than those for classical antiferromagnetics with weak ferromagnetism , fe@xmath51o@xmath52 and la@xmath51cuo@xmath53 . using calculated anisotropic exchange interactions",
    "we have explained the experimentally observed different zero - field energies of @xmath1 and @xmath54 states .    based on our results",
