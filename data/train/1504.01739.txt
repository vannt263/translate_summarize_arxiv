    "globular clusters ( gcs ) host mono - metallic , almost coeval stellar populations that have been studied extensively , both photometrically and spectroscopically . in spite of their multiple populations ( see ) ,",
    "these systems offer well constrained tests for stellar evolution theory .",
    "their colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd , hence photometry ) provide two clear evolutionary diagnostics for the stellar models  the main - sequence turn - off ( msto )",
    "magnitude and the magnitude of the bump in the red giant branch ( rgb ) luminosity function ( lf bump or bump hereinafter ) .",
    "the msto magnitude serves as the classic indicator for cluster age , and by fitting this region of the cmd , modellers can take solace in the fact their codes provide a reasonable approximation to the stellar physics during the early phases of evolution .",
    "the bump magnitude , on the other hand , reveals information about the depth of first dredge - up ( fdu ) and stellar mixing  it is a probe of internal processes that are significant in later stages of evolution .",
    "spectroscopy complements ( and vice - versa ) these photometric studies by providing further quantitative details of the internal mixing processes .",
    "it is our interest in stellar abundances and mixing processes , particularly during the rgb ascent , that motivate this study .",
    "mixing in rgb stars is characterised by two distinct events ; the well - understood fdu and an additional mixing episode that operates over a longer timescale during a more advanced phase of rgb evolution (  extra mixing \" hereinafter ) . only mixing during fdu",
    "is predicted by standard stellar theory @xcite . in low - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) , deep convective motions develop once the star becomes a giant and these can penetrate into regions that have previously experienced partial hydrogen burning .",
    "material enriched in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is mixed through the convection zone increasing the prevalence of these nuclei at the stellar surface .",
    "conversely , @xmath5 and @xmath6 abundances decrease as they are diluted into the extending envelope . in solar - metallicity stars the @xmath6/@xmath4 ratio falls from the solar value of @xmath7 to @xmath8 after the fdu , whilst @xmath5",
    "is depleted by a factor of @xmath9 . up to this point",
    "the theoretically predicted changes are in good agreement with observations .",
    "it is clear from observations that after fdu the surface composition is further altered during rgb evolution .",
    "this second mixing event sees the cycling of hydrogen burning products into the convective envelope . from a post - fdu value of approximately 30",
    ", the @xmath6/@xmath4 ratio reduces to @xmath10 in solar - metallicity stars and to the equilibrium value of @xmath11 in metal - poor stars .",
    "lithium is essentially destroyed at all metallicities .",
    "these changes are not predicted by standard stellar theory .",
    "the onset of extra mixing seemingly coincides with the bump in the luminosity function of gcs .",
    "the mixing is therefore associated with the advance of the hydrogen - burning shell into the composition discontinuity left behind by the deepest extent of fdu .",
    "the internal process(es ) responsible for the surface changes are thought not to manifest themselves until after the bump because the composition discontinuity , and hence discontinuity in the mean molecular weight ( @xmath12 ) gradient , acts as a barrier to any extra mixing process .    in this study",
    "we are concerned with how well stellar models reproduce the key properties ( magnitude / luminosity onset , abundance changes ) of several evolutionary features experienced during the late main - sequence and rgb phase of evolution .",
    "these include :    * the msto magnitude , * the lf bump magnitude , * the difference between the msto and bump magnitude , * the fdu magnitude , * the abundance changes associated with fdu , * the abundance changes associated with extra mixing .",
    "observations of lithium in gc stars are used to constrain fdu and the extra mixing event . matching the magnitude of the lf bump has , in the past ,",
    "been used as a measure of the adequacy of stellar models ( e.g. , ) . here",
    "we draw upon some of the methodology of these studies and compare to recently available large data sets .",
    "we first turn our attention to spectroscopic surveys of lithium abundances in gcs and focus , in particular , on two clusters that are separated in metallicity by factor of ten .",
    "these systems provide a detailed examination of fdu and extra mixing . in order to better sample the metallicity distribution , we utilise hubble space telescope ( hst ) photometry to determine how well stellar models reproduce the msto magnitude , bump magnitude and the difference between the two ( which is independent of distance and reddening ) in a large number of systems .",
    "these three comparisons allow us to investigate the uncertainties introduced from the metallicity scale , distance modulus and bolometric corrections .",
    "we determine how changes to the input physics impact upon the level of agreement between observations and models .",
    "we conclude with a spectroscopic analysis of extra mixing and the ability of the thermohaline mechanism to simultaneously account for the depletion of carbon and lithium as a function of luminosity .",
    "such a demand is a stringent test of any extra mixing process .",
    "the stellar models in this work are calculated with monstar ( the monash version of the mt .",
    "stromlo evolution code ; see ) .",
    "opacities are provided at the high temperature end by the opal rosseland mean opacity tables @xcite .",
    "our standard procedure is to employ tables that are variable in c and o content ( opal type-2 ) based on the solar heavy element mixture specified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the code also utilises additional ( opal type-1 ) tables with a fixed metal distribution when required . for this work",

    "their work yielded the msto magnitudes for 55 clusters to which we compare our models in panels [ fig : nataf_1]a and [ fig : nataf_1]c .",
    "these 55 clusters are a subset of the 72 systems shown in [ fig : nataf_1]b for which they determined the lf bump magnitudes .",

    "fig : nataf_1]a we run into the familiar result ( see also figure 2 of cassisi et al .",
    "2011 ) that 15 gyr isochrones are required to match the msto in many gcs .",
    "it is expected that given the age constraints of big bang cosmology and the cosmic microwave background that the 12 gyr isochrone should provide an upper age limit to the clusters .",
    "the data demonstrates a clear spread in age at each metalliciy with a collection of clusters centred around [ m / h ] @xmath26 dex well modelled by the 8 gyr isochrone .",
    "the stellar models also tend to predict lf bump magnitudes that are too bright compared to the observational data .",
    "there is some agreement at the metal rich end of the spectrum above a metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath27 . at the lowest metallicites the models differ significantly  by up to 0.8 magnitudes for some clusters ( see panel [ fig : nataf_1]d ) .",
    "the fact that our models fail to reproduce the slope of the observational data suggests that we need to give careful consideration to the internal stellar processes and how they operate across different metallicities .",
    "similarly , we find some agreement for the distance - independent @xmath28 parameter at the highest metallicities .",
    "the level of discrepancy outlined in panel [ fig : nataf_1]e is consistent with a roughly constant offset of @xmath29 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the value of @xmath30 found by but their models better reflect gc abundances ( see below for discussions on @xmath2 and @xmath13-elements ) .",
    "it is essential to point out the ` better ' agreement implied by the 8 gyr isochrone .",
    "this track significantly overestimates the msto luminosity and predicts an incorrect age in the low - metallicity clusters but in doing so , better matches the @xmath0 value .",
    "a and [ fig : nataf_1]b except assuming 3% increase to the distance modulus for each cluster .",
    "note the additional results for age@xmath31 gyr and y@xmath32 . ]",
    "our results , irrespective of how the comparison is carried out , imply that the stellar models do not correctly reproduce the stellar structure at low metallicity .",
    "the msto and lf bump magnitudes are underestimated ( too bright ) in our models and we do not match the magnitude difference between these two evolutionary indicators . naively , if we are unable to match the earlier evolutionary events then we have no right to expect to match the later events , but it is possible to shift the magnitude of the lf bump ( essentially ) independently of the msto .",
    "the lf bump is of course dependent on the depth of fdu : if fdu is deeper , then the hydrogen - burning shell will encounter the composition discontinuity at a lower luminosity .",
    "improvements to stellar models can therefore be attained through either refinement of the microphysics or changes in the treatment of mixing .    before we investigate the role of the physics included in the stellar models , we first determine whether uncertainties in the observational data can help reduce the disagreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "one of our key questions pertains to the usefulness of direct comparisons and the uncertainty surrounding the distance modulus .",
    "a range of methods are used to determine the distance to gcs .",
    "the distance moduli listed in the @xcite catalogue ( 2010 edition ) are predominately determined from calibrating the mean v magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "@xcite cites an uncertainty in determining this mean magnitude of at least @xmath33 .",
    "there are also unquantified difficulties in the magnitude - metallicity relation used for calibration @xcite . in the case of ngc 6397 ,",
    "the blue horizontal branch introduces much uncertainty for this method .",
    "its distance modulus was derived by fitting isochrones to the msto @xcite .",
    "in fact most of these techniques used to determine the distance modulus require some form of calibration from isochrones .",
    "figure [ fig : dmtest ] demonstrates how a systematic offset in the distance modulus determination would help to reconcile models with the observational data .",
    "we have reproduced panels [ fig : nataf_1]a and [ fig : nataf_1]b but multiplied the distance modulus for each cluster by an _ ad hoc _ factor of 1.03 .",
    "the 12 gyr msto models now matches the upper extent of the msto magnitudes across all metallicities . directly matching the lf bump with our isochrones requires that some metal - rich clusters possess a @xmath2 content of up to y=0.4 , however , this isochrone is unable to simultaneously provide a lower limit to the msto magnitude in these systems .",
    "further changes to the input physics are seemingly necessary to account for the systems with the brightest lf bumps . in fact , 4 gyr is probably not a realistic age estimate for a gc given their metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , it is somewhat pleasing that parameters within known observational limits can reproduce _ most _ of the data ; a more reasonable state of affairs than requiring stars with ages greater than the hubble time .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by the absence of boutique modelling ( where all known cluster parameters are considered ) and self - consistent determination of the distance modulus ( where fitting is done with the code generating the models ) may contribute to the need for this factor 1.03 .",
    "the chosen metallicity scale is also a source of uncertainty and has been discussed in previous studies .",
    "@xcite , in particular , find that by adopting two different sets of independently determined metallicites for their gc sample , their conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "the models still underestimate the bump magnitude .",
    "we note that a systematic offset of about 0.5 dex in [ m / h ] would help reduce _ some _ of the inconsistency between theory and observation but there is currently no evidence for advocating this .",
    "changes to the distance modulus and metallicity scale are equivalent to applying luminosity translations in the hr diagram .",
    "so whilst ` corrections ' to the observational data may assist with the direct comparison methods they do not help with the distance independent comparisons .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is set by the stellar physics and essentially a constant offset at low metallicity .",
    "the choice of stellar physics has some role to play in reconciling the differences between theoretical and observational determinations of the msto and lf bump magnitudes and , in particular , reducing the luminosity difference between these events . in the following sections we quantify how choices in the modelling affect the bump magnitude and the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "where possible , we generate new isochrones to illustrate the effect of the stellar physics on our parameters of interest , but in some cases we compare individual stellar tracks because it makes the analysis simpler .",
    "we note that because of the short lifetimes of the sgb and rgb , single evolution tracks coincide almost exactly with isochrones .",
    "our models that turn off the main sequence at an age of 12 gyr will serve as an appropriate proxy for the isochrone and once the effects of the microphysics are quantified , they can later be incorporated in the grids of models that generate the isochrones .",
    "the existence of multiple populations in gcs is well documented ( see and references therein ) .",
    "the constituent stars divide into chemically distinct groups that are best explained by explicit stellar generations .",
    "the most commonly proposed scenario is that a fraction of first generation stars pollute the environment from which the subsequent generation(s ) form ( which we herein refer to as second generation ) .",
    "more - massive stars in the first generation , having experienced the advanced phases of stellar nucleosynthesis , burn hydrogen via the cno cycles .",
    "the degree of mixing between first - generation ejecta and pristine cluster gas determines whether the second generations are ` extreme ' population stars ( sometimes formed from pure ejecta ) or belong to the ` intermediate ' population that give rise to the observed anticorrelations ( mixed ejecta and cluster gas , see for discussions on [ p]rimordial , [ i]ntermidiate and [ e]xtreme populations [ pie ] ) .",
    "the extreme population is not evident in every gc , however , it is predicted that all second generation stars are necessarily enhanced in helium compared to their primordial counterparts .",
    "a spread in @xmath2 abundance also straightforwardly explains the horizontal branch morphology in many clusters @xcite and is consistent with observed split main sequences @xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 on the stellar models is well documented in the literature  originally in a series of papers by iben @xcite and more recently by @xcite . @xcite and place an upper limit of @xmath34 on the width of the main sequence for those clusters that do not display split evolutionary tracks .",
    "this in turn decreases the to age by no more than @xmath35 gyr . in clusters such as @xmath36 cen ,",
    "a spread in metallicity and split main - sequences imply a wider span in age , however , these complex systems are in the minority . in most cases ,",
    "gcs are dominated by second generation stars with an inferred separation in age of at most a few hundred myr .",
    "stellar models representative of these stars only further exacerbate the discrepancies demonstrated in figure [ fig : nataf_1 ] . in figure [ fig : masshe4 ] we plot the hr - diagram ( top panel ) and penetration of the convective envelope ( bottom panel ) for three stellar models representative of the pie populations at a metallicity of z=0.00011 .",
    "each model , with its combination of initial mass and @xmath2 content leaves the main sequence with an age close to 12 gyr .",
    "our models are by design the same age and metallicity so there are minor differences in their msto luminosity but they differ in temperature . in the bottom panel",
    "the luminosity of the bump for each model is marked by the dotted vertical lines .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath13-elements has a two - fold effect .",
    "first , it increases the amount of available cno material which impacts upon the nuclear burning .",
    "second , with a larger reservoir of metals , there is a contribution to the opacity that is predominantly manifested as a reduction of the effective temperature . as a function of [ m / h ] , the inclusion of @xmath13-element enhancement results in only minor changes to the msto luminosity .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : opacal ]",

    "we employ @xmath13-enhanced opacity tables but do not change the composition of the models .",

    "@xmath42 is calibrated to the sun , a star halfway through its main - sequence lifetime which possesses a shallow convective envelope ( in mass ) .",
    "this value is then applied across the stellar mass and metallicity distribution and through all phases of evolution .",
    "work by suggests that this should in fact vary with evolutionary status but the solar calibrated mixing length parameter does allow a majority of the model libraries e.g. , basti @xcite , padova @xcite and victoria @xcite to match the effective temperature of rgb stars in gcs ( see also the work by @xcite ) . the value of @xmath42 adopted will significantly shift the model s position in the hr diagram because the convective efficiency will change the surface temperature .",
    "the effect is greatest on the rgb where the stars possess deep convective envelopes . although not illustrated here , we find that the depth of fdu is not altered significantly by this parameter ( see also ) and we find variation of approximately 0.05 mag between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "the depth of fdu for each combination is plotted in the adjacent panel .",
    "the fitting formula , which is the default choice in monstar , provides the shallowest penetration of the convective envelope of all five eos combinations .",
    "this choice of eos therefore yields the greatest discrepancy with the empirically determined lf bump magnitude .",
    "the deepest penetration of the convective envelope is achieved by using the opal eos and leads to approximately 0.1 magnitude better agreement with the empirical data .",
    "once it had been identified that stellar models overestimate the bump luminosity , suggested that overshooting by @xmath48 pressure scale heights ( @xmath49 ) at the base of the convective envelope would provide the required shift in magnitude to reconcile theory with observations . using the formalism outlined in  [ modov ] we find that values of @xmath50 significantly improve the agreement with the observations  both with the direct comparison of the bump magnitude and with the @xmath51 parameter . in figure",
    "[ fig : os ] we plot the 12 gyr isochrone with no overshoot ( blue curve ) , @xmath52 ( lavender curve ) and @xmath53 ( vermilion curve ) .",

    "the isochrones reproduce the gradient of the @xmath51 parameter , but do not match the bump magnitudes .",
    "the isochrones still do not provide an upper limit to the some of the most metal - poor clusters but do satisfactorily explain intermediate - metallicity and metal - rich clusters .",
    "this may hint that at the need for an overshoot formalism that is a function of metallicity such that :    * for [ m / h ] @xmath54 no overshoot is required ; * between @xmath55 [ m / h ] @xmath56 overshoot increases to @xmath57 ; * between @xmath58 [ m / h ] @xmath59 overshoot increases to @xmath60 ; * for [ m / h ] @xmath61 overshoot @xmath62 is required .",
    "it is interesting to note that our models with overshoot can not simultaneously provide a lower limit to the absolute magnitude of the bump and the @xmath51 parameter . in the left panel of figure [ fig : os ]",
    "the most efficient form of overshoot we have modelled predicts a bump location that is approximately 0.3 magnitudes too bright in the most metal - poor clusters .",
    "if we include more efficient overshoot such that our curve encompasses the bump magnitude of these systems , it will necessary reduce the separation between the msto and lf bump .",
    "this is in spite of the fact the vermilion curve ( @xmath53 ) currently forms a satisfactory lower envelope .",
    "the discrepancy between the two panels implies that the models predict a msto magnitude that is too bright for a 12 gyr isochrone  an outcome of different input physics .",
    "such a result reflects the fact 15 gyr isochrones are required to account for the msto luminosities in figure [ fig : nataf_1]a .",
    "determinations of the key hydrogen burning reaction rates have changed little since @xcite save for the significant revision of the @xmath3(p , @xmath21)@xmath22 rate which we have discussed in  [ modov ] and use in the current calculations .",
    "one possible source of improvement lies with the recent measurement of the iron opacity at temperatures pertaining to solar interiors .",

    "demonstrate the significant role that the high temperature opacities have on the luminosity of the msto .",
    "an increase in fe opacity will help reduce the msto luminosity . only a small improvement is likely because the change is wavelength dependent and fe is just one of many elements that contribute to the opacity .",
    "the inclusion of additional physical processes is an obvious avenue of pursuit with the role of atomic diffusion especially a contentious issue ( see and references therein ) .",
    "if the process is not inhibited then atomic diffusion will reduce the ms lifetime and hence the turn - off luminosity @xcite .",

    "we expect that the models are representative of both clusters despite the small difference in metallicity .",
    "ngc 5466 was one of the three metal - poor gcs studied by @xcite in their investigation of thermohaline mixing .",
    "of the three , this was the only system in which thermohaline mixing appeared to reproduce the depletion of [ c / fe ] along the rgb .",
    "ngc 6397 seems to display the same ambiguity as its more massive counterparts : it is difficult to identify the onset of extra mixing from the [ c / fe ] data and one could argue that it begins well before the expected bump .",
    "[ c / fe ] in ngc 5466 , having been homogeneously analysed from a cluster of comparable size to ngc 6397 , serves as the best analogue to the li data .",
    "we find that a mixing efficiency of @xmath70 depletes li much too fast ( top panel figure [ fig:10a ] ) but is able to account for the depletion of [ c / fe ] in both clusters ( bottom panel figure [ fig:10a ] ) . in figure [ fig:10b ]",
    "we investigate lithium depletion the clusters listed in table [ tab : clusters ] with the exception of ngc 2808 where the data does not include stars experiencing extra mixing . in most cases",
    "our models provide a lower limit to the post - fdu li abundances ( on account that we have not tuned the initial abundances for each cluster ) . to guide the eye , we have artificially translated the @xmath70 models to a higher post - fdu abundance ( dotted vermilion curves ) to indicate how depletion would proceed with boutique abundance choices of each system . in nearly all gcs the models with @xmath68 and @xmath69 provide preferable fit to the li data .",
    "the result is not entirely clear cut , especially in in the case of ngc 1904 .",
    "however , we note that it is only the stars that have severely depleted li that introduce some doubt .",
    "those stars that are experiencing extra mixing ( just after the bump ) are better reproduced by the lower @xmath67 values thus these are our preferred values for reproducing the depletion of li in gcs . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig:10a ]",
    "it is clear that with values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 not enough carbon is processed to match the trend of [ c / fe ] .",
    "we are unable to simultaneously account for [ c / fe ] and a(li ) with the same free parameter .",
    "matching both these abundances poses a challenge for any postulated mixing mechanism .",
    "the fragility of li and robustness of c must be reproduced .",
    "it may be that thermohaline mixing is not responsible for the surface composition changes of rgb stars .",
    "objections to the mechanism are based on theoretical grounds and 3d hydrodynamical simulations @xcite that suggest the mixing is inefficient in the rgb regime .",
    "but we have described how the mechanism at work here can be considered a physically based phenomenological model . rather than mixing to a constant temperature or mass location from the hydrogen burning shell ,",
    "material is transported to where @xmath18 burning creates an inversion in the @xmath12 profile .",
    "@xcite show how this location depends on the shell - burning conditions that change with rgb luminosity . in this extra mixing formalism",
    "we have varied the free parameter that controls the mixing rate .",
    "we note that @xcite have advocated that a deeper ( than the @xmath12 inversion ) but slower mixing may be required .",
    "it is not clear yet if this scenario could explain the abundance trends here .",
    "we have modelled thermohaline mixing as a diffusive process .",
    "our evolution code employs a one - dimensional diffusion algorithm to model a process that is inherently three dimensional and advective .",
    "convection is characterised by streams ( or plumes ) of upward and downward travelling material .",
    "the majority of the nuclear processing in the extra mixing region occurs where material turns over near the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "a diffusive treatment of mixing assumes that the composition difference between convective elements at the same mass coordinate is negligible .",
    "if the mixing speed in the extra mixing region is much slower than convection ( as it generally is believed to be ) , then the turnover time is closer to the reaction timescale .",
    "we therefore expect a difference between the compositions of material approaching and returning from the envelope at the same mass coordinate .",
    "it may in fact be necessary to develop a more realistic treatment of convection to better model the extra mixing process .",
    "codes that calculate mixing via advective streams may prove to be enlightening .",
    "we have utilised photometric and spectroscopic measurements of gcs to investigate the current state of red giant branch modelling .",
    "observations at key evolutionary epochs , namely the msto , fdu and lf bump , provide a series of constraints for our stellar models .",
    "li determinations in seven gcs covering a factor of ten in metallicity have served as the key spectroscopic diagnostic .",
    "the surveys of ngc 6397 , the most metal - poor cluster in our sample , and m4 , the most metal - rich , are of particular interest as they cover a luminosity range that extends from the subgiant branch to beyond the lf bump .",
    "homogeneous li data , spanning the key evolutionary indicators has allowed us to confirm the long - suspected ambiguity associated with inferring the onset of rgb mixing from [ c / fe ] .",
    "the many uncertainties in determining the [ c / fe ] combine to give the appearance that mixing begins prior to the lf bump . in the seven clusters analysed here",
    "the onset of lithium depletion coincides with the photometric bump magnitude .",
    "we determined that the abundance changes predicted by fdu in the models are consistent with spectroscopic measurements , but we also found evidence that the luminosity at which mixing begins in the low - metallicity clusters is slightly overestimated .",
    "data from a larger sample of clusters and predictions from other stellar evolution codes will help confirm this behaviour .",
    "the luminosity that coincides with onset of extra mixing was significantly overestimated by our models , especially in the low - metallicity regime . by considering models of these two rgb mixing events we found that stellar codes better reproduce the structure of high metallicity stars . to further examine this hypothesis we turned to photometric data of the msto and lf bump in a large sample of gcs .",
    "we directly compared the predicted msto and bump magnitudes as well as the parameter @xmath28 to the corresponding values measured from photometry .",
    "we reproduced two well known results : i ) that 15 gyr isochrones are required to match the msto in some clusters and ii ) that the models match the bump luminosity at the highest metallicities , but significantly overestimate it at low - metallicity .",
    "there is currently no reason to doubt the bolometric corrections at low - metallicity and there is no evidence to suggest that uncertainties in the metallicity scale are significant enough as to be responsible for the discrepancy . a systematic underestimation of",
    "the distance modulus by a factor of 1.03 would see 12 gyr isochrones provide an upper limit to the ages of the gcs but would shift the models out of agreement with metal - rich clusters . a systematic error in the distance modulus",
    "would not explain the fact that the models do not reproduce the observationally determined @xmath28 which is independent of distance and reddening .",
    "changes to the stellar physics are the only means by which the theoretical value of @xmath28 can be made consistent with observations .",
    "our tests demonstrated that reasonable variations to the stellar microphysics do not significantly alter the stellar structure .",
    "our investigations covered composition and @xmath13-element enhancement , opacity , convective efficiency and the eos choice on rgb evolution . of these , updating monstar to the most recent opal eos yielded the greatest improvement ( @xmath37 0.1 mag compared to the @xmath76 mag required ) . the inclusion of diffusive overshoot in the models is sufficient to reproduce the bump magnitude and @xmath28 at intermediate and high metallicity . in order to directly match the bump magnitude at low - metallicity the efficiency of overshoot",
    "needs to be increased , so much so that agreement with @xmath28 is lost .",
    "the fact that our models with overshoot can not simultaneously provide a limit ( as a function of [ m / h ] ) to the absolute magnitude of the bump and @xmath28 is most likely due to predicted msto magnitudes that are too bright for 12 gyr isochrones .    the final test of the models focussed on their ability to reproduce the abundance changes associated with extra mixing .",
    "we determined that the thermohaline mechanism could not simultaneously account for the reduction of [ c / fe ] and a(li ) as a function of rgb luminosity .",
    "as it stands , current observations imply that at low metallicity li and carbon begin mixing a different luminosities .",
    "this result is independent of models and seemingly impossible . in the six gcs examined ,",
    "a free parameter between @xmath75 provided a bounds to the li data .",
    "this is in contrast to a value of @xmath70 cited throughout the literature to match the carbon abundances in various stellar environments . whilst this discrepancy is a challenge for thermohaline mixing",
    ", the constraints may prove difficult for other mechanisms also , as li is likely to be destroyed very efficiently under the conditions required to deplete c. finally we suggest that the diffusive mixing algorithm used in stellar modelling may not be adequate to follow elements such as li that are very sensitive to the local thermodynamic history . in order to quantitatively",
    "match observations numerical codes may require a more realistic treatment of mixing .",

    "<S> we conduct a series of comparisons between spectroscopic and photometric observations of globular clusters and stellar models to examine their predictive power . </S>",
    "<S> data from medium - to - high resolution spectroscopic surveys of lithium allow us to investigate first dredge - up and extra mixing in two clusters well separated in metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> abundances at first dredge - up are satisfactorily reproduced but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that the models overestimate the luminosity at which the surface composition first changes in the lowest - metallicity system . </S>",
    "<S> our models also begin extra mixing at luminosities that are too high , demonstrating a significant discrepancy with observations at low metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we model the abundance changes during extra mixing as a thermohaline process and determine that the usual diffusive form of this mechanism can not simultaneously reproduce both the carbon and lithium observations . </S>",
    "<S> hubble space telescope photometry provides turnoff and bump magnitudes in a large number of globular clusters and offers the opportunity to better test stellar modelling as function of metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we directly compare the predicted main - sequence turn - off and bump magnitudes as well as the distance - independent parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we require 15 gyr isochrones to match the main - sequence turn - off magnitude in some clusters and can not match the bump in low - metallicity systems . </S>",
    "<S> changes to the distance modulus , metallicity scale and bolometric corrections may impact on the direct comparisons but @xmath0 , which is also underestimated from the models , can only be improved through changes to the input physics . overshooting at the base of the convective envelope with an efficiency that is metallicity dependent is required to reproduce the empirically determined value of @xmath0 .    </S>",
