    "@xmath2    imagine we are given an @xmath0-simplex @xmath3 , viewed as a  @xmath1-complex in a  standard way : the vertices are indexed with numbers @xmath4 , and the order of the vertices in each boundary simplex is induced by that global order .",
    "there is , in a certain sense , unique way to identify the boundary simplices with each other , if we want to identify as many simplices as possible , while at the same time preserving the property that the quotient has the induced @xmath1-complex structure .",
    "this is achieved by taking any two boundary simplices of the same dimension and gluing them by the unique linear isomorphism which preserves the order of the vertices .",
    "when @xmath5 , we obtain a  circle .",
    "when @xmath6 , we obtain the so - called _ dunce hat _ , which is a  classical example of a  contractible space , that is not collapsible .",
    "graphically , we think about this boundary simplex identification as _ scrambling_. viewed as a  @xmath1-complex , this _ maximally scrambled _",
    "@xmath0-simplex will have a  single simplex in each dimension .",
    "this paper grew out of the attempts by the author to better understand and to generalize this well - known construction by relaxing the _ scrambling condition_. our suggestion is that , guided by a  certain combinatorial principle , we identify only some of the boundary simplices of the same dimension , instead of gluing together all of them .    specifically , we start by putting labels on the vertices of the original @xmath0-simplex .",
    "we think about these labels as _ letters _ , so listing the labels of vertices @xmath4 , in that order , gives a   _ word _",
    "given a  boundary simplex , we can list the labels of its vertices in the standard order , obtaining a  _ subword _ of @xmath7 . using the same linear isomorphism as above",
    ", we now identify any two boundary simplices , which yield the same subword .",
    "these simplices are necessarily of the same dimension , as this is just the length of the subword minus @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to see that the obtained space has the induced structure of a  @xmath1-complex , which we denote  @xmath9 .",
    "the maximally scrambled case above corresponds to putting the same label on all the vertices of @xmath3 , or , in other words , the word @xmath7 consists of a  single letter repeated @xmath10 times . at another extreme ,",
    "if all the labels are different , then no identifications take place at all , and our space is just the original @xmath0-simplex itself .",
    "the whole family @xmath11 can then be seen as approximating between simplices and higher - dimensional dunce hats .",
    "there is a rich and well - developed theory of combinatorially defined simplicial complexes , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of similar work in the category of @xmath1-complexes . accordingly",

    "somewhat surprisingly , all these spaces are either contractible or homotopy equivalent to odd - dimensional spheres .",
    "the combinatorial rule which reads off from the word @xmath7 the homotopy type of the corresponding space  @xmath9 is as follows . if @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are ( not necessarily disctinct ) letters , and @xmath14 are ( possibly empty ) words , such that @xmath15 does not occur in @xmath16 , for all @xmath17 , then @xmath9 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath18 , else @xmath9 is contractible .    as the added benefit , we are able to emulate the dunce hat phenomenon , and to obtain a  large family of simplicial complexes , which are contractible , but not collapsible .",
