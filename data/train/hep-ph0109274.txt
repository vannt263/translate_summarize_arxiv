    "one of the most fundamental problems in nuclear physics is to understand how low - energy nucleon - nucleon interactions arise from the underlying quark - gluon interactions .",
    "unfortunately , for some time to come qcd is likely to remain computationally intractable in this regime in the sense that one will not be able to directly predict the values of low energy nuclear physics observables by calculations based solely on the qcd lagrangian . nevertheless one might hope to be able to deduce some qualitative ( or perhaps semi - quantitative ) features of nucleon - nucleon interactions from our knowledge of qcd .",
    "the known simplifications of certain aspects of qcd in the large @xmath0 limit could provide such a tool @xcite .",
    "indeed , several years ago it was proposed that the spin - flavor structure of the dominant terms in the nucleon - nucleon potential can be understood in terms of large @xmath0 qcd @xcite . as we shall argue here",
    "large @xmath0 qcd can provide additional insights into the nature of the nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "in particular large @xmath0 qcd helps us to understand both the nature of the meson - exchange picture of nucleon - nucleon interactions and the limitations of such a picture .",
    "the large @xmath0 perspective also sheds light on the role of the @xmath2 resonance in nucleon - nucleon interactions . at a practical level , knowledge of the special role played by @xmath2 in canceling certain large contributions",
    "may prove to be useful in constructing nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the first treatment of nucleon - nucleon interactions in large @xmath0 qcd was done by witten in his seminal paper on baryons in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "he argued that the dominant interaction between two baryons is generically of order @xmath0 .",
    "his argument was based on consideration of diagrams such as the one in fig .",
    "it is clear that such a diagram is order @xmath0a factor @xmath3 from combinatorics and a factor of @xmath4 from the coupling constants .",
    "it is straightforward to see that all quark - line - connected graphs beginning and ending with two flavor singlet combinations of @xmath0 quarks will be @xmath5 or less .",
    "however , this interaction strength of order @xmath0 can not represent the strength of the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude . in the first place",
    ", unitarity implies that the scattering amplitude does not grow without a bound as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "secondly , one can consider graphs like fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which although disconnected at the quark level , contribute at the nucleon - nucleon level to the full interaction .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is order @xmath6 so that the interaction can not simply go as @xmath0 .",
    "one natural way to interpret the physics contained in the diagrams typified by figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] is to argue that they get translated at the hadronic level to contributions from nucleon - meson diagrams as in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "in such a hadron - based picture the @xmath7 contribution then appears as the iteration of an underlying @xmath5 interaction .",
    "one key issue addressed in this paper concerns the nature of the translation from the quark - gluon based diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] to the hadronic based ones of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "witten @xcite noted an additional difficulty of having nucleon - nucleon interaction scaling as @xmath0 , there is no description of the scattering process which possesses a smooth large @xmath0 limit if the momenta are of order unity .",
    "the basic difficulty in this case is that the kinetic energy of the nucleons is generically much smaller than the potential energy and the interplay of kinetic and potential energy which is at the crux of scattering can not be independent of @xmath0 .",
    "witten noted that if one works in a kinematic regime with momenta of order @xmath0 ( @xmath8 an approach to the large @xmath0 limit with the nucleon velocities rather than momenta fixed ) , then the kinetic and potential terms are of the same order so that a smooth limit is possible .",
    "for this kinematic regime witten suggested that the scattering process can be described using the time - dependent hartree ( tdh ) approximation .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the tdh equations with fixed initial velocity have solutions which are independent of @xmath0 . in practice ,",
    "such tdh calculations have not been done in qcd and would be very difficult for systems with light quarks .    here",
    "we wish to focus on a different limit than witten s , _",
    "i.e. _ on low momentum nuclear reactions .",
    "accordingly we do not wish to let the nucleon momenta scale with @xmath0 ; rather we will restrict our attention to the kinematic regime of nucleon momenta of order @xmath1 . as noted by witten ,",
    "in such a regime there is no smooth expression for the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , as argued by kaplan and savage @xcite and kaplan and manohar @xcite in this regime one may identify the nucleon - nucleon interaction from the quark line connected pieces as a nonrelativistic potential which has a dominant contribution of order @xmath0 .",
    "such a description can be interpreted on the hadronic level as a meson exchange .",
    "the one - meson exchange potential ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) can be as large as @xmath9 since a generic baryon - meson coupling is of order @xmath10 @xcite and hence the large @xmath0 scaling at the hadronic level is consistent with the quark - gluon level .",
    "the key insight of refs .",
    "@xcite is that large @xmath0 qcd implies an approximate contracted @xmath11 spin - isospin symmetry on the baryons and that this symmetry imposes constraints on the dominant parts of the potential .",
    "thus , the dominant part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction are constrained to be contracted @xmath11 symmetric and terms which break this symmetry are suppressed by two powers of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the dominant @xmath12 contribution to the tensor force is proportional to @xmath13 , while the isospin independent part only contributes at order @xmath14 .",
    "this paper will address a number of issues connected with the nucleon - nucleon interaction in large @xmath0 qcd .",
    "one central issue is the identification of the connected diagrams , such as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , as a nonrelativistic potential ( of order @xmath0 ) , as was done in refs .",
    "the argument for doing this is clearly heuristic and is based on the notion that large interactions must be iterated to all orders .",
    "of course , a potential used in a schrdinger equation is iterated to all orders .",
    "this interpretation seems to resolve in a simple manner the order @xmath6 contributions of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; it is just one iteration of the potential ( among an infinite number of possible iterations ) .",
    "unfortunately , this heuristic argument is not unique : an alternative argument would be to identify such an interaction with a kernel of a bethe - salpeter equation ( with a strength of order @xmath0 ) which again is to be iterated to all orders .",
    "moreover , it is by no means clear that these are equivalent  a bethe - salpeter kernel of order @xmath0 does not necessarily imply that the potential in a nonrelativistic reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation is order @xmath0 . thus , at the fundamental level it has to be established whether large @xmath0 qcd is consistent with a nonrelativistic nucleon - nucleon potential of order @xmath0 or with a bethe - salpeter kernel of order @xmath0 .",
    "a second fundamental issue in this paper is the extent to which large @xmath0 qcd justifies a meson exchange picture of nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "a meson exchange is a natural way to understand nucleon - nucleon interactions as arising from qcd : qcd leads to the existence of colorless hadronic states  baryons and mesons  and the interactions between baryons arise from the exchange of virtual mesons .",
    "indeed , some phenomenologically successful nucleon - nucleon potentials are based directly on a meson exchange picture @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the argument for meson exchange dominating the nucleon - nucleon interaction is not compelling and many equally successful nucleon - nucleon potentials include only one - pion exchange treating all shorter distance effects purely phenomenologically @xcite . at first sight it might seem that large @xmath0 arguments do not support the meson - exchange picture of nucleon - nucleon interactions . in the first place , as noted by witten @xcite baryons in the large @xmath0 behave as solitons , and when two solitons are brought close enough to interact each one distorts in the presence of the other yielding effects which can not be easily described in terms of meson exchange . indeed witten s prescription for scattering for momenta of order @xmath0 , tdh , necessarily builds in these non - meson - exchange type effects ; the clusters of @xmath0 quarks which interact in tdh are _ not _ simply the hartree wave - functions for two nucleons .",
    "there is a second reason why one might suspect that large @xmath0 qcd does not justify a meson exchange point of view for nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the meson - exchange picture does not imply only single meson exchanges but two or more meson exchanges as well .",
    "consider , the large @xmath0 scaling of a generic two - meson exchange process .",
    "some typical diagrams contributing to the potential are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , in which two exchange mesons are coupled to one of the nucleons at a single vertex .",
    "such diagrams are generically of order @xmath0 since the coupling of the meson current to a nucleon is of order @xmath1 @xcite ; the additional power of @xmath0 comes from two nucleon - meson vertices ( each of which contributes @xmath15 .",
    "thus , these diagrams are consistent with the previously deduced large @xmath0 scaling behavior of the potential . however , if one considers a generic crossed - box diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one encounters an inconsistency . since , the nucleon - meson coupling is generically of order @xmath10 , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is of order @xmath16 .",
    "this scaling , however , violates the proposed large @xmath0 scaling of the nucleon - nucleon potential ( which is supposed to go as @xmath0 ) .",
    "clearly , three and more meson exchange diagrams will yield ever - larger inconsistencies .",
    "this paper will also address another central issue in nucleon - nucleon physics ; namely , the role of the @xmath2 resonance in intermediate states .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath2 resonance has a low excitation energy for large @xmath0 ( with @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of virtual @xmath2 s is known to be essential to ensure the consistency of large @xmath0 predictions for hadronic processes and its inclusion is necessary for the contracted @xmath11 spin - flavor structure of baryons to be manifest .",
    "thus , one might expect that virtual @xmath2 s will also play a key role in nucleon - nucleon reactions in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in this paper we will show the following picture is consistent with large @xmath0 qcd : + i ) the nucleon - nucleon interaction can be described by a potential of order @xmath0 but _ not _ by a bethe - salpeter kernel of order @xmath0 .",
    "+ ii ) the meson - exchange picture can be used consistently to describe nucleon - nucleon interactions for momenta of order @xmath1 .",
    "+ iii ) the meson - exchange picture of the nucleon - nucleon potential ( of order @xmath0 ) breaks down for momenta of order @xmath0 .",
    "+ iv ) the leading order nucleon - nucleon potential is symmetric under contracted @xmath11 with corrections down by two powers in @xmath0 yielding the spin - flavor structure of ref .",
    "+ v ) the contracted @xmath11 structure implies a central role for intermediate states containing @xmath2 s .",
    "the basic strategy of this paper is to assume that the picture outlined above is correct and then to show that it does not lead to any inconsistencies up to and including two - meson exchange potentials .",
    "the key difficulty which must be addressed is the problem of the crossed - box graphs mentioned above : if point ii ) is correct then they must be included ; however , they generically contribute to the potential at order @xmath6 which exceeds the potential s supposed order @xmath0 scale from point i ) .",
    "more generally they lead to contributions that are inconsistent with the spin - flavor structure of refs .",
    "however , as we will show , all contributions from the crossed - box graphs which are inconsistent with the spin - flavor structure of refs .",
    "@xcite are canceled by contributions coming from the retardation effects in the box graphs .",
    "while it has long been known that such a cancelation occurs for scalar isoscalar mesons between retardation effects in the box graph and the crossed - box graph @xcite , it has not been previously shown that such cancelations are far more general and protect the large @xmath0 structure of the nucleon - nucleon potential including the hierarchy of large and small contributions in terms of spin and isospin .",
    "it will also be shown that such a cancelation does not occur if @xmath2 intermediate states are excluded or if the momenta of the nucleons is of order @xmath0 .",

    "since meson masses are of order @xmath163 an increasing number of mesons are produced .",
    "it is hardly surprising that the potential picture breaks down in this situation .",
    "a fourth point raised in the introduction was that relative sizes of the various spin - isospin structures in the nucleon - nucleon potential are consistent at the two - meson - exchange level with those deduced from the contracted @xmath11 structure of ksm .",
    "moreover , if one looks carefully at all of the cancelations , one finds that corrections to the leading behavior were all @xmath64 suppressed .",
    "this is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite where it is found that subleading spin - isospin structures are down by factors @xmath64 .",
    "overall this strongly supports the view that the expansion is in fact in @xmath64 rather than in @xmath27 .    the final point stressed was that the @xmath2 plays an essential role .",
    "as is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ a1a1 ] ) and the appendix , the cancelations between the box and crossed - box graphs do not occur if intermediate states are restricted entirely to nucleons ; @xmath2 resonances are required as intermediate states .",
    "more generally one expects that as the contracted @xmath11 structure is used to obtain cancelations the entire @xmath21 tower of baryon states can contribute .",
    "up to two - meson exchange with nucleon as initial and final states , however , only nucleons and @xmath2 s can contribute .",
    "the formal consistency of the large @xmath0 treatment and the meson exchange picture is quite satisfying .",
    "however , considerable caution should be exercised in trying to draw conclusions about the real world of @xmath164 .",
    "we have used @xmath27 as a counting parameter to distinguish large from small contributions .",
    "this is clearly legitimate if all the coefficients multiplying these factors are natural , _",
    "i.e. _ of order unity",
    ". however , all coefficients are not natural .",
    "one key difficulty is that the meson - exchange picture is being used here to connect hadronic phenomena with nuclear phenomena .",
    "however , the scales in nuclear physics are generally much smaller than those in hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "it is not clear directly from qcd why these nuclear scales are so small and it is generally thought to be `` accidental '' .",
    "the interplay between small nuclear scales ( that may be large in a @xmath27 sense ) with much larger hadronic scales ( that may be small formally in a @xmath27 sense ) can potentially spoil the results of a straightforward @xmath27 approach . to show how extreme this problem may be we can consider the deuteron binding energy ,",
    "_ b _ ( which is formally of order @xmath0 ) and the delta - nucleon mass difference , @xmath165 ( which is order @xmath27 ) . if all coefficients were natural , one would expect @xmath166 to be an order of magnitude larger than @xmath165 , whereas , in fact , it is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "it would not be surprising that difficulties might arise when calculating @xmath166 if one neglects @xmath165 as being `` small '' .",
    "the large @xmath0 structure of the nucleon - nucleon potential has been so far used phenomenologically in two contexts .",
    "the first is as an attempt to justify the observed approximate wigner @xmath11 symmetry @xcite in light nuclei as arising from the underlying contracted @xmath11 structure in the large @xmath0 potential @xcite .",
    "the second is an attempt to justify the qualitative sizes of the spin - flavor structures in phenomenological potentials as being explained by contracted @xmath11 structure in the large @xmath0 potential @xcite .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that these two explanations are legitimate in light of qualitatively distinct nuclear scales that are not associated with the @xmath27 expansion .",
    "clearly , this issue needs further investigation .",
    "however , it is also not immediately clear how to formulate a systematic expansion which both incorporates the @xmath27 scaling rules while allowing nuclear scales to be much smaller than hadronic scales .",
    "the comparison of the qualitative sizes of the spin - flavor structures in phenomenological potentials with what is expected from large @xmath0 raises another issue .",
    "the potentials predicted in large @xmath0 are not nucleon - nucleon potentials ; rather , they are coupled channel potentials for the full tower of @xmath20 baryon states including an explicit @xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenological potentials to which they are compared have the explicit @xmath2 s integrated out .",
    "it is by no means clear that the act of integrating out @xmath2 s does not alter the spin - flavor structure .",
    "again , this requires further study .",
    "given these possible difficulties in drawing phenomenological conclusions from large @xmath0 potentials , one might ask about the relevance for the real world of our demonstration that large @xmath0 counting rules are consistent with the meson - exchange picture of potentials at the two - meson - exchange level .",
    "of course , it remains possible that after a careful study one may find that the particular phenomenological predictions to date  the wigner @xmath11 symmetry and the characteristic relative sizes of the various terms in phenomenological potentials  are robust and remain valid even after the smallness of the typical nuclear scales are included .",
    "whether or not this turns out to be the case , however , we may still be able to learn qualitatively interesting things .",
    "for example , the cancelations seen in the two - pion exchange graphs require that @xmath2 intermediate states be included .",
    "for @xmath164 , one does not expect such cancelations to be perfect , but the general tendency to cancel should survive .",
    "this suggests that @xmath2 box and crossed - box contributions should be comparable in size to the ones with nucleon intermediate states .",
    "this issue may be relevant for potential models motivated by chiral symmetry where two - pion exchange contributions with nuclear intermediate states are included at next - to - leading order but explicit @xmath2 contributions are not included@xcite . at a more qualitative level ,",
    "the fact that at large @xmath0 a meson - exchange motivated picture of the potential is consistent gives at least some support for the view that more generally nucleon - nucleon interactions can be described in terms of meson exchanges .",
