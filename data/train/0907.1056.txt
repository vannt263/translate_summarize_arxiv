    "[ section - introduction ]    the structure of genetic regulatory networks can be abstracted by directed graphs , where the nodes represent genes and the arrows ( oriented edges ) stand for their interactions through transcription / translation products .",
    "these interactions may be either activations or inhibitions . given the large number of components in most networks of biological interest , connected by positive and negative feedback loops , the comprehension of the dynamics of a system is often difficult if not impossible . in this context , _ mathematical modeling _ eventually supported by _ computer tools _ can contribute to the analysis of a regulatory network by allowing the biologist to focus on a restricted number of plausible hypotheses , or to easily read some observed features of the system .",
    "we refer to   and references therein for an account of the huge and still growing literature on this topic .",
    "it has been evidenced that the existence of network  _ motifs _ , a set of recurring patterns inside large biological regulatory networks , shall give new insight on the understanding of the performances of the global network.we refer to the review  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) for a clear and complete description of such a point of view and references therein for recent work in different specific biological contexts . since most of the time these _ modules _",
    "@xcite also have input and output interactions relating to the rest of the network , they may be considered as open dynamical systems , meaning distinguished parts of larger closed systems , the remaining of the network being an environment.    in the classical literature of dynamical systems , `` open '' or `` forced '' dynamical systems are defined as those for which the dynamics depends on internal rules as well as on inputs from the environement , then producing some outputs back to the environement .",
    "the notion of open systems is also the groundwork of system theory and many results concerning the possibility to control linear and nonlinear systems have been obtained in the last decades  @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in a description of the dynamics of these systems in all the parameter space and subjected to any external signal .",
    "when comparing these modules with the standard corresponding regulatory networks we are faced to new questions to understand their dynamical behavior and , therefore , their possible new functionalities .",
    "here we study some of these questions by searching first for general properties of such systems and by trying to identify the fundamental mechanisms at work in the open systems we deal with .",
    "although our definition of module is not the most general possible , as it will appear next , it seems that it contains all the cases treated in the literature and , remarkably , it allows simpler proofs in many cases .",
    "these general properties must be complemented in each particular case with further analysis to derive additional specific properties of a given module and we perform this task for some examples .    what we found in the general case may be summarized as follows : each elementary input selects a particular subset of the phase space and a particular dynamical rule among a ( finite ) set of possibilities allowed by the module ; therefore any ( finite or infinite ) sequence of inputs drives the dynamics of the module along a pre  determined maze of possible paths .",
    "simple sequences of inputs give rise to simple dynamics of the module and therefore to simple responses ( outputs ) , but , since they fix the system in a  corner \" of its phase space , the system may acquire new functionalities as we shall see in some examples . moreover , because such constraints in phase space may depend of the values of the parameters of the system and not only of its structure ( the pattern of interactions ) it turns out that the structure can not determine the functionality in all cases  @xcite .",
    "it will also be clear from what follows that , on the contrary , in some cases it can happen that the type of response is not essentially affected by a change of parameters , and only particular aspects do , _",
    "e.  g. _ speeding or slowing of the response .",
    "interestingly , when a module can perform more than one function , each one is generally robustly provided .",
    "this fact does not exclude the possibility of a fine tuning of the interaction between the input and the internal dynamics that may end in an interesting interplay between both .    despite the fact that the proofs of our results is done for a special type of model of regulatory networks , i. e. discrete time dynamical systems",
    ", we believe that these results have a more general thrust , for the underlying mechanisms are common to other types of dynamical systems , as odes for instance .",
    "besides , discrete  time models provide a simple framework where the consequences of interaction delays are already included and they largely benefit from tools and techniques in the dynamical systems theory .",
    "we study two different types of modules .",
    "the first one , called regulatory cascades ( rc ) , is defined as any open network without ( internal ) circuits .",
    "the second type , called forced circuits ( fc ) , is any open circuit .",
    "the general case can be build as a combination of such elementary pieces and at the end we sketch the analysis of one such mixed rc - fc module on the bases of our previous results .    for the rc modules we give a complete description of the dynamics .",
    "we specify , in particular , the output as a function of the input knowing the structure and the internal set of parameters of the module .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of such rc works as a special kind of cellular automata and , due to a celebrated result in @xcite , they can emulate a universal turing machine !    for the fc modules , we give a complete description of the dynamics for the cases of one and two units in the fundamental case of constant inputs and for all the parameter values of the circuits . using the exponential contracting rate of the system ,",
    "the behavior for more general input signals follows . here",
    "the input level fixes the dynamics of the module in a subset of the phase space allowing dynamical regimes that do not correspond to the typical autonomous version .",
    "the relation between the transducer like point of view used in the rc analysis and the constrained phase space used for the fc is done by symbolic dynamics .",
    "it is worth to notice that , as we shall see , modules that we show to perform different dynamical behaviors may be functionals in different situations  , therefore allowing to perform different functions either for given values of parameters through different inputs , or vice  versa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 recalls the basic properties of the models , section 3 describes the dynamics of the regulatory cascades ( rc ) , section 4 describes the dynamics of the forced circuits ( fc ) and section 5 shows how , in simple cases , it is possible to treat a mixed type module .",
    "section 6 is concerned with final comments and outlooks .",
    "[ section - defintions ]         we consider a special class of models , i. e. discrete  time regulatory networks .",
    "these are discrete  time dynamical systems on a network ( see  ) . by a network we mean a digraph , with vertices in a given finite set @xmath0 and with arrows ( oriented links ) taken from another given finite set @xmath1 , together with a set of additional characteristics we introduce next .",
    "vertices account for interacting units carrying a certain activity level ( a scalar in @xmath2 $ ] associated to each unit @xmath3 ) , depicting the product of a gene , and the arrows account for the interactions between them .    although the results presented below hold for more general interactions ( as for instance multiplicative interactions ) we restrict ourselves to additive inhibitory  activating interactions for the sake of simplicity ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the model is defined as follows : to each arrow @xmath4 we associate an interaction threshold @xmath5 $ ] , a sign @xmath6 indicating whether the action of @xmath7 over @xmath8 is an activation @xmath9 or is an inhibition @xmath10 , and a coupling strength @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the activity level of the network at time @xmath12 is specified by the collection of the @xmath13 $ ] , expressing the activity of each unit @xmath3 at time @xmath14 .    denoting @xmath15 the set of vertices acting over a vertex @xmath3 , the activation at time @xmath16 of the unit @xmath3 is given by @xmath17 the constant @xmath18 appearing in the equation plays the role of a degradation rate . in absence of interaction",
    ", the activity level of a unit @xmath8 decreases exponentially fast to zero , @xmath19 . in the interaction terms",
    ", @xmath20 represents the heaviside ( step ) function , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "hence each interaction term is a piecewise constant function whose value changes whenever one of the coordinates @xmath25 crosses its own threshold @xmath26 .    without loss of generality",
    "the coupling strengths are normalized by @xmath27 for each @xmath3 .    in  @xcite we described the dynamics of some of this networks in great details .",
    "we shall come back to these results when comparing with their open versions .",
    "[ open_networks ] as mentioned above an open network is defined as part of a larger regulatory network together with the corresponding incoming and outgoing arrows , respectively from and to the rest of the network .",
    "_ motifs _ are such open networks that appear more often than the expected frequency in some null statistical graph model  . in the present paper",
    "we study open subnetworks without any reference to their possible abundance inside a larger regulatory network and we rather call  module  any ( simple ) open subnetwork .    any collection of @xmath28 vertices @xmath29 of a network @xmath0 defines an open network ( as long as not all the arrows with head in @xmath30 have tail in @xmath30 )",

    "the same is then true for every basic attractor of the open system .",
    "the generic case , in measure sense in parameter space , is such that each of the basic attractors is uniformly bounded away from the discontinuities ( the internal thresholds ) . in this case ,",
    "any orbit with constant forcing will approach the attractor exponentially fast , with rate @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , for a general forcing the corresponding orbit will wander around the basic attractors and will closely approach one if the forcing input stays constant during a sufficiently long duration , and the dynamical behavior of the system is clear in this case .",

    "they oscillate at a low level and in case of @xmath122 as input at a high level .",
    "this situation occurs after some transient time if the initial condition of @xmath290 happen to be outside the corresponding invariant interval .",
    "second , _ the fixed induced regime _ which is different from the autonous case : if @xmath412 and for @xmath383 as input , any trajectory will be attracted by the unique fixed point of @xmath405 .",
    "this fixed point is @xmath413 .",
    "the reason is that , after a finite time we get @xmath414 and from then the signal @xmath415 sent to node @xmath7 is always @xmath122 ( since this interaction is an inhibition ) . as consequences , @xmath416 and",
    "the signal @xmath42 sent to node @xmath8 is then always @xmath122 ( since now this interaction is an activation ) .",
    "therefore , also @xmath417 .",
    "finally , in this case , for a @xmath383 as input , the circuit ends up in @xmath418 , @xmath419 . the case @xmath420 and @xmath122 as input is solved in the same way , and the circuit ends up in @xmath421 , @xmath422 .",
    "notice that in the fixed induced case , contrarily to the autonomous circuit , it is not the initial conditions that determines the final destination of the system but the external input .",
    "now , by a convenient choice of the external versus internal intensity it is possible to set @xmath423 or @xmath424 .",
    "therefore there are four possible open negative 2circuits : ( 1 ) the bi  oscillating circuit that oscillates at small amplitude for a low level input and at a high amplitude for a high level input ; ( 2 ) the oscillating ",
    "fixed circuit that oscillates at low amplitude for low level input and converges to @xmath421 , @xmath422 for high level input ; ( 3 ) the fixed  oscillating circuit converging to @xmath418 , @xmath419 for low level input and oscillating for high level input and ( 4 ) the bistable circuit that converges to @xmath418 , @xmath419 or to @xmath421 , @xmath422 according to a low or high input level .",
    "finally , for a more general ( time variable ) input this open circuit may work in different manners and , by appropriately tuning the forcing it is possible to switch the circuit from one regime to another .    by the same arguments ,",
    "the open negative 2circuit with reversed sign of interactions works in the same manner .",
    "the same type of argument shows that for a positive 2circuit and a constant external forcing , in one case it is bistable as is the autonomous system @xcite , but becomes monostable in the opposite case .",
    "therefore , it is also possible to build bistable  bistable , bistable ",
    "monostable , monostable  bistable and monostable ",
    "monostable circuits working in the pointed regimes for low  high input levels .",
    "again it is clear in this case that an open positive circuit may operate in a regime different from the autonomous counterpart .",
    "in particular , an oscillatory input may drive the positive circuit in oscillations .",
    "notice that in  @xcite the same discrete  time piecewise  affine model have been numerically studied to account for the dynamics of a p53mdm2 genetic regulatory network made of an open positive and an open negative 2circuit in interaction , with one inward regulation acting on each of the two circuits . in our notation , node @xmath7 stands for p53 and node @xmath8 for mdm2 .",
    "the analysis above extend to the case of open n - circuits , in the same way as for the corresponding autonomous circuits @xcite .",
    "in the more general case when a module owns one or more circuits inside a regulatory cascade it is in principle possible to combine our results and describe all its possible dynamical behaviors . for large networks",
    "this method will soon end up in the study of the network as a all and therefore it is of any help .",
    "however for simple networks the splitting of the all network in elementary rc and fc modules may help the study of their dynamics . as an example",
    "let us consider the incoherent type 1 feeforward loop ( i1ffl )  @xcite , depicted in figure [ figalon ] .",
    "we first determine the possible dynamical regimes for the open self ",
    "inhibitor present at the level of gals .",

    "this information immediately fixes @xmath429 where @xmath430 is the delay due to the interaction @xmath431 as described in  [ the general regulatory cascade ] .",
    "notice also that @xmath432 is just equal to the input signal @xmath433 after the delay @xmath434 due to the node @xmath435 .",
    "of course the delays @xmath434 and @xmath436 are only important during a transient time after one of the external signals eventually changed ( as it is the case for a pulse input ) . if not , time translation invariance of the inputs simplify the analysis .",
    "it is then sufficient to incorporate this information in the description of the dynamics of the rc made in  [ the general regulatory cascade ] . as a consequence this module can end up with , either an oscillatory regime for the final gene operon @xmath437 corresponding to an input corresponding to an `` oscillation '' entry of the table , or in a `` steady state '' ( low or high level ) for an input with this entry .",
    "we emphasize that this module may operate in very different regimes either by a change of parameters ( due for instance to a mutation ) or by some modulation of the input signals , or both .",
    "[ section - final ] in this work we made an attempt to understand how a small regulatory network is operating under external stimulus .",
    "this stimulus can be , either the output of a larger network where the module is inserted or simply an external signal acting as a trigger mechanism for the action of the module .    for regulatory cascades ( rc ) we have shown that there are two ( non exclusive ) conditions under which the rc acts as a finite time delayed transducer ( or translator ) exactly as a cellular automata .",
    "it takes a finite input `` message '' in another finite output `` message '' .",
    "this two conditions are , either an internal property of the module ( readable in its parameter values ) or an external characteristic of the input signal . in a sense we can say that under one ( or both ) of this conditions the module works in a safety operating regime since it can transmit an unambiguous command with only some delay .    in the opposite case ,",
    "the situation is different since then , in principle , the module needs a variable , eventually infinite , time to `` understand '' the input message and then to be able to produce an unambiguous output .",
    "moreover this time delay may depend of the particular input signal ( see final part of remark  [ long - remark ] ) .",
    "no doubt that in this case the module is not of a great help for the system , even if this behavior is fascinating from the point of view of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "but maybe nature has found already somewhere a situation where this fuzzy  like operating regime has some selective advantage !    from a mathematical point of view our strategy was first to prove these properties on the simplest possible module ( the elementary transducer et ) and then extend them step by step up to the general case ( rc ) .    for the forced circuits ( fc ) we use a slightly different strategy .",
    "in each case we work out the subsets of the phase space involved in the dynamics under each external input . here",
    "the case of stationary inputs enable a simple classification of the different `` extreme '' dynamical responses of the module .",
    "then thanks to the contracting ( or diffusive ) properties of the dynamics ( a consequence of degradation ) we may predict the dynamics under more general inputs .",
    "this also opens the possibility to build small modules with different desired functionalities . from a mathematical point of view",
    "our strategy was simply to restrict the dynamics in each fc to the part of the phase space that became invariant and attractive under each specific input .",
    "these small open circuits show how their functioning may depend on the parameters as well as on the different type of inputs . in this context , the notion of modularity for the accomplishment of a function can not be reduced to a simple decomposition of the network into subsets of nodes and interactions .",
    "an example where such ambiguity may be interesting for a biological function is the case where for a while a cell population needs two types of differentiated cells ( corresponding to low and medium expression level of genes for instance , see figure  [ supplementary_cuer_6 ] ( b ) , up to a moment when , under an appropriate signal ( generated by a stress for instance ) , the two states switch to the same effective differentiated state ( high expression level of genes for instance ) , see figure  [ supplementary_cuer_6 ] ( c ) .",
    "now we may wonder why we need one point of view ( transducer ) when dealing with rc and another ( constrained phase space ) to study fc .",
    "the two points of view are in fact equivalent .",
    "the bridge between them is symbolic dynamics .",
    "the starting point of symbolic dynamics is to encode the atoms of a suitable partition of the phase space by a set of symbols and to transfer the description of the dynamics in the phase space in terms of rules on the corresponding symbolic representation . in our case",
    "the partition of phase space is naturally determined by the set of thresholds and the corresponding symbols by the values of the heaviside function @xmath438 . with this dictionary in mind",
    "it is clear that the transducer in the rc case uses the phase space made available by the input signal to encode the message and , _ vice ",
    "versa _ , in the fc each node send to the others a code defined by its position in the available phase space .",
    "these are just two faces of the same coin .",
    "our conclusion is that the existence of open designed dynamical modules leads to an extremely reach set of different dynamical behaviors making such units capable of carrying through various performances in response to different external stimuli .",
    "but , on the other hand we have seen that in many cases the same functionality may be performed by different modules .",
    "the possible criteria for the selection of a particular module among other displaying the same function open to very interesting questions  @xcite .",
    "the fine tune of the dynamics of a module by a complex input is a current subject of our efforts .",
    "as for further research in a connected direction , we mention the interesting problem of reverse engineering , control and bifurcations for such modules that we have just touched in example  [ example3 ] .",
    "we are still far from a complete understanding of the way how module s architecture , parameters and inputs are related to functionalities in all cases , and _ vice - versa_. nevertheless we are convinced that our results give an insight in the fascinating interplay between modularity and dynamics .",
