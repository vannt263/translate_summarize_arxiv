    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) detected by the _ iras _ all - sky survey radiate large , quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath0 a few @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath4 ) as infrared dust emission @xcite ; therefore they must consist of extremely powerful energy sources that are obscured by dust .",
    "ulirgs have also been found at large distances ( @xmath9 0.3 ) , where they have been used to trace the dust - obscured star formation rate , dust content , and metallicity of the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether ulirgs are powered by dust - obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or starbursts .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the energetically dominant components in the majority of ulirgs are compact ( @xmath10a few 100 pc ) , highly dust - obscured nuclear energy sources , rather than extended ( @xmath5kpc ) , weakly obscured starburst activity @xcite .",
    "it is essential to determine whether these compact energy sources consist of agns and/or compact starbursts .",
    "approximately 30% of ulirgs classified optically as seyferts are known to possess energetically important agns surrounded by dust with the geometry of a _ torus _ @xcite .",
    "however , the agns expected to reside in the majority of non - seyfert ulirgs may be deeply buried in dust along all lines of sight .",
    "it is necessary to determine the energetic importance of such _ buried _ agns in order to understand the true nature of ulirgs .    to estimate the relative energetic contributions of an agn and a starburst , it is necessary to utilize signatures that are produced by only one of these processes .",
    "one such signature is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission found in the infrared 315 @xmath11 m wavelength range @xcite .",
    "pah emission is usually observed in a normal starburst , but not detected in a pure agn @xcite .",
    "thus , pah emission can be used to detect starburst emission , by disentangling from agn emission , in an agn / starburst composite , such as a ulirg , and pah luminosity traces the starbutst s absolute magnitude @xcite .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath11 m pah emission feature and dust absorption features found in infrared 34 @xmath11 m spectra have been used to detect candidates for non - seyfert ulirgs possessing energetically important buried agns @xcite .",
    "one example of this type of object is ugc 5101 ( z = 0.040 ) .",
    "it has an infrared ( 81000 @xmath11 m ) luminosity of l@xmath12 @xmath53 @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath4 , a cool far - infrared color ( _ iras _ 25@xmath11m - to-60@xmath11 m flux ratio of @xmath100.2 ) , and is optically classified as a liner , based on a systematic spectral classification of galaxies @xcite .",
    "imanishi et al . ( 2001 ) found the observed infrared 34 @xmath11 m spectrum of ugc 5101 to be best explained by the presence of a powerful buried agn .",
    "@xcite argued that the nuclear energy source in ugc 5101 is more centrally concentrated than nuclear gas and dust , as is expected for a buried agn , rather than a normal starburst , which shows a mixed dust geometry @xcite .",
    "radio vlbi observations @xcite and a near - infrared high spatial resolution image obtained with _ hst _",
    "@xcite also detected compact , high surface - brightness emission , which was interpreted as an agn by these authors .",
    "therefore , there is mounting evidence for the presence of a buried agn in this galaxy .",
    "the detection of strong , absorbed 210 kev x - ray emission can provide compelling evidence for a powerful buried agn , because an agn is a much stronger 210 kev x - ray emitter than a starburst .",
    "previous x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ failed to find clear evidence for x - ray emission from the putative agn @xcite . here , we report analysis of high quality x - ray data of ugc 5101 obtained with _",
    "xmm _ and _ chandra_. the high spectral sensitivity of _ xmm _ at 210 kev was fully utilized to detect absorbed hard x - ray emission from the putative buried agn .",
    "_ chandra _ data are used to investigate the x - ray morphology , benefiting from its high image quality , as well as to check the overall spectral consistency with the _ xmm _ spectrum . throughout this letter",
    ", we use a cosmology of h@xmath13 @xmath14 75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath15 = 0.3 , and @xmath16 = 0.7 .",
    "an _ xmm _ observation of ugc 5101 was performed with the epic cameras ( pn , mos1 , and mos2 ) in full - frame mode on 2001 november 12 .",
    "we used standard data analysis procedures with the xmm science analysis software ( sas version 5.4 ) , together with standard software packages ( ftools 5.2 and xspec 11.2 ) .",
    "time intervals with high background count rates were removed from the events files , and we included only events corresponding to patterns 04 for pn and 012 for mos , as suggested in the sas handbook .",
    "the resulting exposure times , after screening for time intervals with high background , were 25.1 and 33.1 ksec for pn and mos , respectively .",
    "we used the most recent calibration files retrieved from the xmm web page and response matrices created with sas for our data analysis .",
    "we extracted a source spectrum using a 22.5 arcsec radius circular region .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from a nearby source - free circular region with a radius of 60 arcsec .",
    "we binned the spectra so that each energy channel contained a minimum of 20 counts .",
    "an absorbed hard x - ray component was clearly detected only in the pn spectrum , which contains the most counts .",
    "therefore , we used the pn spectrum to obtain rough measurements of important parameters . however , to improve the statistics , final spectral fitting was performed using the combined pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra .",
    "we allowed the relative normalizations of the cameras to vary in our spectral fits as there is some uncertainty in the relative flux calibration of the three cameras .",
    "a _ chandra _ observation was performed on 2001 may 28 with the acis - s3 back - illuminated ccd chip .",
    "the data were reprocessed using ciao 2.2.1 and caldb 2.17 .",
    "an effective exposure time of 47.8 ksec was obtained after discarding high background intervals .    a _",
    "chandra _ spectrum of the nucleus was extracted from a circular region with a radius of 8 arcsec .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from an annular region around the nucleus and subtracted from the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was binned to facilitate the detection of emission - line features .",
    "the @xmath17-statistic was used to fit the spectrum since the number of events in each bin is small .",

    "the source is extended beyond the psf of _ chandra _",
    "( @xmath51 arcsec diameter for @xmath085% encircled energy ) .    figure  [ fig2]a shows the _ xmm _ epic spectrum of ugc 5101 .",
    "in addition to the soft emission dominating the 0.52 kev x - ray range , an absorbed hard component at @xmath03 kev and emission line at @xmath56.5 kev were clearly seen .",
    "the hard component is likely to originate in the putative buried agn , and so we fitted this component with a power - law model .",
    "the emission line at @xmath56.5 kev is likely to be the neutral fe k@xmath6 line at 6.4 kev , and was fitted with a narrow gaussian profile . for the soft component , a 0.51 kev thermal emission model ( mekal model in xspec ) from a starburst",
    "was first attempted to fit the soft x - ray spectrum , particularly the apparent spectral peak at 0.71 kev . however , significant residuals were present in this model fit .",
    "therefore , we added ( a ) higher temperature thermal emission ( 510 kev ) from hot gas and x - ray binaries in a starburst , or ( b ) a second power - law component , which could be due to thomson scattering of the power - law emission from the agn .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the best - fit parameters for these models . to estimate the power of the putative buried agn ,",
    "the most important measurement is the absorption - corrected 210 kev x - ray luminosity of the hard component , l@xmath1(210 kev ) .",
    "both models result in a similar l@xmath1(210 kev ) of @xmath55 @xmath2 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 and have a 6.4 kev fe k@xmath6 line of modest equivalent width ( ew@xmath18 @xmath5 400 ev ) .",
    "we varied some of the model parameters within reasonable ranges ( e.g. , a power - law photon index of @xmath19 = 1.02.0 , a temperature between 59 kev for the high - temperature thermal emission , and abundances of 0.10.4 solar for the thermal emission ) ; however , these changes result in values of l@xmath1(2 - 10 kev ) , which are consistent within a factor of @xmath102",
    ".    figure  [ fig2]b shows the _ chandra _ acis spectrum .",
    "the solid line overplotted for comparison is based on model a ( in table 1 ) from the _ xmm _ epic spectrum , with normalization of the continuum and of the gaussian component representing the fe k@xmath6 line as free parameters and were determined from the _ chandra _ acis spectrum .",
    "the overall spectral shape is very similar to the _ xmm _ spectrum . in the soft energy band ,",
    "several emission lines are seen : strong he - like si ( @xmath51.9 kev ) and he - like s ( @xmath52.5 kev ) .",
    "we detected the absorbed hard component , but the amount of absorption of this component is not well constrained from the _ chandra _ spectrum alone , because of the paucity of photons at the highest energies ( @xmath07 kev ) .",
    "the fe k@xmath6 emission feature at 6.4 kev is also detected in the _ chandra _ spectrum . to estimate its equivalent width",
    ", we fitted the _",
    "spectrum in the 47.5 kev band to minimize uncertainties in the modeling of the continuum .",
    "model a ( in table 1 ) was applied to the continuum .",
    "the equivalent width was estimated to be ew@xmath18 = @xmath20 ev ( @xmath21 = 2.7 ) .",
    "this value is similar to the estimate based on the _ xmm _ epic spectrum ( table 1 ) .",
    "the extremely large equivalent width ( 5.9@xmath22 kev , @xmath23 = 4.605 ) reported by @xcite was not confirmed with our analysis .",
    "ugc 5101 shows starburst activity with spatial extension of a few kpc ( @xmath54 arcsec ) in the east - west direction @xcite , with dust obscuration at a level similar to that of the nearby prototypical starburst galaxy m82 in both mixed - dust and foreground - screen dust models @xcite .",
    "the extended morphology seen in the _ chandra _ 0.52 kev image ( @xmath54 arcsec in the east - west direction ; fig.1 ) and the detection of emission lines in our spectra ( fig.2 ) suggest that thermal emission from the extended starburst contributes significantly to the soft x - ray emission below 2 kev . assuming that all of the soft x - ray emission is of thermal origin ( model a in table 1 ) ,",
    "the absorption - corrected 0.52 kev soft x - ray luminosity is l@xmath24(0.52 kev ) @xmath5 1.2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 , which results in l@xmath25(0.52 kev)/l@xmath12 @xmath5 4 @xmath2 10@xmath26 .    in a starburst galaxy ,",
    "the 0.52 kev x - ray to far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath11 m ) luminosity ratio is typically l@xmath24(0.52 kev)/l@xmath27 @xmath5 2 @xmath2 10@xmath28 @xcite . as the far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath11 m ) and infrared ( 81000 @xmath11 m ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) luminosities do not differ very much in an ordinary starburst ,",
    "the l@xmath24(0.52 kev)/l@xmath12 ratio in ugc 5101 is a factor of @xmath55 lower than the value expected for a normal starburst .",
    "if some fraction of the soft x - ray emission originates in scattering of the power - law agn component , this discrepancy is even larger . in ugc 5101 ,",
    "the ratio of starburst - tracing 6.2 @xmath11 m pah luminosity ( measured using large - aperture spectroscopy with _ iso _ ; spoon et al . 2002 ) to infrared luminosity , is also lower by a factor of @xmath54 than that of a normal starburst @xcite .",
    "as the properties of the extended starburst in ugc 5101 are not expected to differ significantly from a normal starburst , these results both suggest that the modestly obscured extended starburst is unlikely to be the dominant energy source in ugc 5101 .",
    "as the hard x - ray component is strongly absorbed , it can not originate in x - ray binaries from the modestly obscured extended starburst @xcite .",
    "the most plausible origin is an agn deeply buried in gas and dust at the core .",
    "the modest equivalent width of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath6 line suggests that direct x - ray emission from the agn is detected , because in physically plausible agn geometries , a scattered x - ray component is expected to show a very large ( @xmath01 kev ) equivalent width @xcite .",
    "if the absorbed hard component is direct emission , we find an absorption - corrected 2 - 10 kev luminosity for the buried agn of l@xmath24(210 kev ) @xmath5 5 @xmath2 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 ( @xmath29 3 ) . in principle",
    ", the modest ew@xmath18 of the detected hard component could be produced in a scattering situation , _ if _ it is thomson scattered by highly ionized gas .",
    "if this is the case , the intrinsic l@xmath24(210 kev ) is even higher than our estimate above .",
    "the l@xmath24(210 kev)/l@xmath12 ratio for ugc 5101 is @xmath52 @xmath2 10@xmath30 .",
    "l@xmath24(210 kev ) values have been measured for some seyfert-2 infrared luminous galaxies ( l@xmath12 @xmath0 a few @xmath3110@xmath8 ergs s@xmath4 ) where the detected 210 kev emission is interpreted as a direct component , because of the modest equivalent widths of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath6 emission ( @xmath101 kev ) .",
    "examples include iras 20460 + 1925 @xcite , iras 23060 + 0505 @xcite , pks 1345 + 12 @xcite , and mrk 463 @xcite .",
    "all are thought to be powered by agns , with no detectable starburst activity in the infrared @xcite",
    ". the l@xmath24(210 kev)/l@xmath12 ratios of these known agn - powered , seyfert-2 , infrared luminous galaxies are between 0.002 and 0.02 , with mrk 463 having the lowest value ( l@xmath24(210 kev ) @xmath5 4 @xmath2 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 ; ueno et al . 1996 ,",
    "l@xmath12 @xmath5 2 @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath4 ) . a smaller value of l@xmath24(210 kev)/l@xmath12 is expected for a buried agn than for a seyfert-2 agn surrounded with dust in a toroid geometry , because in the former case , a larger fraction of the photons emitted from the agn are absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the infrared .",
    "thus , the buried agn in ugc 5101 is likely to be as powerful as that in mrk 463 , in terms of both absolute 210 kev x - ray luminosity and ratio to infrared luminosity .",
    "regardless of whether the primary energy source of ugc 5101 is a buried agn or a starburst , the large infrared luminosity is produced by uv emission .",
    "the contribution from the detected x - ray - emitting buried agn to the total energy output in the infrared depends highly on the intrinsic uv to 210 kev x - ray luminosity ratio ; this is poorly understood and could vary substantially among the population of agns .",
    "the buried agn could account for the bulk of the infrared luminosity in ugc 5101 if its intrinsic uv to 210 kev ratio is similar to the agn in mrk 463 .    by applying a template of infrared spectral energy distribution of",
    "a _ classical _ , moderately infrared luminous agn and a _ normal _ starburst to ugc 5101 , @xcite argued that infrared dust emission flux from ugc 5101 at @xmath32 @xmath10 10 @xmath11 m is dominated by an agn , while that at @xmath32 @xmath14 101000 @xmath11 m is dominated by a starburst .",
    "this conclusion comes primarily from the known fact that a classical agn generally shows a warmer infrared color than a normal starburst @xcite .",
    "however , ulirgs are known to have a larger column density of obscuring dust than classical , less infrared luminous agns @xcite , and thus infrared emission from the buried agns in ulirgs should be cooler than that from classical agns . furthermore , a significant fraction of dust grains in ugc 5101 was found to be ice - covered @xcite , which also causes the infrared color to be cooler than bare dust grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , a much larger fraction of the infrared dust emission from ugc 5101 at @xmath010 @xmath11 m can be produced by the buried agn than that estimated by farrah et al .. indeed , if an observed excess in the 60 @xmath11 m luminosity function at the highest luminosity end , over the extrapolation from lower luminosity , is caused by agn contribution @xcite , then it is suggested that agn - powered dust emission can contribute significantly to the luminosities of ulirgs at as long as 60 @xmath11 m .",
    "these factors should be taken into account to correctly understand the origin of strong dust emission from ugc 5101 at @xmath32 @xmath0 10 @xmath11 m .",
