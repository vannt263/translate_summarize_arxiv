    "what is irreversibility of a process ?",
    "this question , in this form , does not make much sense .",
    "we first have to specify `` irreversibility with respect to what '' .",
    "it means we first need to decide a set of rules ",
    "e. a set of allowed transformations together with some free resource  to which one has to conform when trying to revert the process .",
    "we can then say that irreversibility basically measures the deterioration of some resource that does not come for free , within the rules we specified .",
    "when studying quantum error correction , one usually considers an extremely strict scenario , where legitimate corrections only amount to a fixed quantum channel applied after the action of the noise .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the task of trying to restore the entanglement initially shared by the input system ( undergoing the noise ) with an inaccessible reference , only by using local actions on the output system , being any kind of communication between the two systems impossible .",
    "being quantum error correction a basic task in quantum information theory , the literature on the subject grew rapidly in the last 15 years  @xcite .",
    "it is however possible to devise two main sectors of research : the first one is devoted to the design of good quantum error correcting codes , and directly stems from an algebraic approach to _ perfect _ quantum error correction ; the second one tries to understand conditions under which _ approximate _ quantum error correction is possible . usually , while the former is more practically oriented , the latter is able to give information theoretical bounds on the performance of the optimum correction strategy , even when perfect correction is not possible , while leaving unspecified the optimum correction scheme itself .",
    "our contribution follows the second approach : we will derive some bounds relating the loss of entanglement due to the local action of a noisy channel on a bipartite state with the possibility of undoing such a noise . the original point in our analysis",
    "is that we will consider many inequivalent ways to measure entanglement in bipartite mixed states , hence obtaining many inequivalent measures of irreversibility . after reviewing the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will show how we can relate such entropic quantities with different norm - induced measures of irreversibility , like those exploiting the cb - norm distance  @xcite or the channel fidelity  @xcite , therefore providing measures of the overall  i .",
    "e. state independent  irreversibility of a quantum channel .",
    "in the following , quantum systems will be often identified with the ( finite dimensional ) hilbert spaces supporting them , that is , the roman letter @xmath0 [ resp .",
    "@xmath1 , rigorously denoting the system only , will also serve as a shorthand notation instead of the more explicit @xmath2 [ resp . @xmath3 .",

    "( we will see in the following how to get rid of the explicit dependence on the input state and obtain a quantity measuring the overall invertibility of a given channel , as a function the channel only . )    before continuing the discussion , we should clarify what we mean with the term `` coherence '' .",

    "then , the coherence of the evolution  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) can be understood as the amount of residual entanglement survived in the bipartite output ( generally mixed ) state @xmath21 after the noise locally acted on @xmath0 only .",
    "however , any naive attempt to formalise such an intuitive idea is soon frustrated by the fact that there exist many different and generally inequivalent ways to measure the entanglement of a mixed bipartite system  @xcite .",
    "this well - known phenomenon turns out in the existence of many different and generally inequivalent , but all in principle valid , ways to measure the coherence of an evolution .",
    "one possibility to overcome such a problem was considered already in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", schumacher introduced the quantity called _ entanglement fidelity _ of a channel @xmath22 with respect to an input state @xmath11 , defined as @xmath23 such a quantity ( which does not depend on the particular purification @xmath18 considered ) accurately describes how close the channel @xmath15 is to the noiseless channel @xmath24 on the support of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however , it was noticed that , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ent_fid ] ) , @xmath25 is _ not _ related to the coherence of the evolution @xmath26 , in that it is easy to see that a unitary channel ",
    "e. completely coherent  can result in a null entanglement fidelity .",
    "we then have to consider a more general situation , like the one depicted in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    ", here , after the noise @xmath15 , we apply a subsequent correction via a local restoring channel @xmath27 .",

    "however , for sake of clarity of notation , we will leave such dependence understood , and make it explicit again , by writing @xmath32 , only when needed .",
    "we now compute the _ corrected _ entanglement fidelity @xmath33 and take the supremum over all possible corrections @xmath34 this is now a good measure of the coherence of the noisy evolution @xmath26 : by construction it is directly related to the degree of invertibility of the noise @xmath15 on the support of @xmath11 .",
    "the maximisation over all possible correcting channels in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr_ent_fid ] ) can be extremely hard to compute . moreover , we are still interested in understanding how the coherence of a transformation is related to the theory of bipartite entanglement .",
    "the idea is that of finding some quantity ( typically an entropic - like function ) which is able to capture at one time both the amount of coherence preserved by the channel as well as the invertibility of the channel itself , possibly bypassing the explicit evaluation of @xmath35 , for which accurate upper and lower bounds would suffice .",
    "a key - concept in the theory of approximate quantum error correction is that of _ coherent information _",
    "@xcite , which , for a bipartite state @xmath36 , is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath39 .",
    "notice that , in the definition of coherent information , system @xmath0 and system @xmath40 play apparently different roles : such asymmetry acknowledges that the flow of quantum information is considered as being from @xmath0 to @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly , _ channel coherent information _ is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 stand for reference , input , and output system , respectively . in our picture , the input state @xmath18 is pure , so that @xmath43 .",
    "we then compute the coherent information loss due to the action of the noise @xmath15 on subsystem @xmath0 as @xmath44 where the non - negativity follows from the data - processing inequality  @xcite .    the following theorem (",

    "@xcite and second part in ref .",

    "( [ eq : corr_ent_fid ] ) .",
    "the above theorem can be summarised by stating that the loss of coherent information of an input pure state @xmath18 due to a channel @xmath15 acting on @xmath0 is small ( that means @xmath45 close to zero ) if and only if the channel @xmath15 can be approximately corrected on the support of @xmath11 ( that means @xmath35 close to one ) .",

    "coherent information loss is now an extremely handy quantity to deal with , easy to compute and providing sufficiently tight bounds on the invertibility of the noise .",

    "a relation between noise invertibility and various entanglement measures will be the aim of the next section .",
    "in the following we will focus on a widely studied family of possible entanglement measures , namely those which stem from von neumann entropy and analogous quantities . among these measures , that often gain an operational interpretation as the optimum asymptotic rate at which a particular entanglement transformation can be done , we find , e.  g. the _ distillable entanglement _ @xmath58 , the _ distillable key _",

    "summarising this section , the important thing is that there always exist a threshold ( which is strictly positive for finite dimensional systems ) below which all entanglement losses become equivalent , in the sense that they can be reciprocally bounded ( it is noteworthy that , in the case of squashed entanglement loss and coherent information loss , we can have dimension - independent bounds , which is a desirable property when dealing with quantum channels alone , see section  5 below ) .      it is interesting now to forget for a moment about the channel @xmath15 itself , and see what eqs .",
