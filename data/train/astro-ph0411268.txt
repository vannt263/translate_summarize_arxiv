    "the few particles forming here are very small which is , however , sufficient to make @xmath10 , which causes these atmospheric layers to become dust - poor . the gas phase is strongly depleted in condensible elements .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    nucleation takes placemainly in the upper parts of the cloud layer , where the temperatures are sufficiently low and the elemental replenishment by mixing is sufficiently effective .",
    "although the gas is strongly depleted in heavy elements in these layers , it is nevertheless highly supersaturated ( @xmath11 ) such that homogeneous nucleation can take place efficiently .",
    "the dust grains remain small @xmath12 m . the mean drift velocities are even smaller than in region  0 because of the higher gas densities .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    with the inward increasing temperature , the supersaturation ratio @xmath13 decreases exponentially which leads to a drastic decrease of the nucleation rate @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , nucleation becomes unimportant at some point , . here , the condensible elements mixed up by convective overshoot are mainly consumed by the growth of already existing particles , which have formed in region",
    "i and have drifted into region  ii .",
    "the gas is still strongly supersaturated @xmath15 , indicating that the growth process remains incomplete , the condensible elements provided by the mixing are not exhaustively consumed by growth .",

    "at the same time the drift velocities increase .",

    ".    this metal deficiency decreases with decreasing height and its observational relevance will depend on where the @xmath24level is reached .",
    "the model atmosphere adopted here would appear strongly metal deficient .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the gas phase has approximately solar abundances since it is strongly mixed with gas from the deep interior and the depletion by the growth of the few large particles drifting through is has only little influence .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the size dependent evaporation of the inward drifting dust grains causes a height dependent element enrichment of the inner , hot and dense atmospheric regions .",
    "it might , however , lay below the @xmath24level and may therefore be only visible for rather warm substellar objects .",
    "if the inertia of the atmospheric gas is larger than its friction , large reynolds number , turbulence will develop if a driving mechanism is present .",
    "substellar atmospheres seem to provide both : high reynolds numbers and convection as driving mechanism .",
    "consequently , simulations of brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres have to deal with the multi - scale problem as it is characteristic for turbulent systems . in classic static model",
    "atmospheres the mixing length theory is used to describe the multi - scale problem of turbulent convection . only one  the most energy containing scale of the system @xmath25  is used to model the whole scale spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in simulations of dynamic model atmospheres more advanced methods have been used , like the artificial viscosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which damps fluctuations such that no energy is contained in the smallest but still resolvable scale ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the large eddy simulation tries to use information from the edge of the resolvable regime to model the residual , unresolved scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "obviously , knowledge needs to be accumulated about this small - scale regime . a hierarchical investigation from small to large scale",
    "has been started by @xcite as sketched by in fig .",
    "the basic idea is that convective elements do collide and thereby create a whole spectrum of disturbances , turbulent fluctuations .",
    "+    fluctuations carry expansion waves which can initiate dust formation by a local drop of the temperature below the nucleation threshold .",
    "if thermal stability is assured , these seed particles grow to macroscopic sizes and start to radiate thermally .",
    "the result is a reinforced cooling of the gas / dust mixture in the small scale regime .",
    "a feedback loop sets in which assures more dust to form until all condensible material is consumed from the gas phase .",
    "the dust complex has then reached a steady state ( compare fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "relying on these results , @xcite have adopted the concept of driven turbulence where a whole spectrum of superimposed waves constantly enters and thereby disturbs an initially dust free gas inside a test volume .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates the principle findings : the dust formation process is initiated on the smallest length scales resulting in a very inhomogeneous distribution of dust .",
    "similar results were obtained based on asymptotic analysis of the nucleation rate in fig .  2 in @xcite . the smallest observable dust structure in the present fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top ) is @xmath27 m after @xmath28s with the smallest resolved scale being @xmath29 m . these small scale heterogeneity lasts not very long .",
    "ongoing hydrodynamic disturbances cause the dust structures to gather in larger and larger cloud - like structures causing a ( mesoscopic ) large - scale heterogeneity . lanes and curls appear and disappear during these dynamic process of gathering .",
    "structures of the size of @xmath30 m have developed in the presented simulation after @xmath31s ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , bottom ) .",
    "note that the appearance of curls indicates the development of vorticity which is typical for turbulent systems . during the time of active dust formation",
    ", sites with high vorticity appear and the question may be raised if the formation of dust can cause turbulence .",
    "the answer seems to be positive since the appearance of dust in a system has a strong feedback onto the system s temperature and the velocity field , the thermal and the dynamic structure of the atmosphere .",
    "this idea is supported by the results of 1d simulations of which one example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where means with standard deviations are depicted .",
    "the apparent standard deviation is largest in the period of most active dust formation , between 0.05s and 3s , independent of the initial reference temperature .",
    "almost no variations are present in the dust quantities if the dust complex has reached its steady state which is much in contrast with the hydrodynamic quantities ( top four panels in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) which are continuously perturbed by the turbulence driving mechanism .",
    "[ [ optical - depth ] ] optical depth : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    adopting rosseland mean gas opacity typical for the hot , inner layers of a brown dwarf atmosphere and the rosseland mean dust opacity for astronomical silicates , the variability of the total opacity and the space mean optical depth for the size of our test volume ( 500 m ) has been investigated . for the simulation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the dust and the gas opacities differ by about 1.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the dust opacities vary by about 0.5 magnitudes , whereas the gas opacity by only about 0.2 order of magnitudes .",
    "this is independent of the characteristic time scale of the system , the large - scale mach number of the initial configuration .",
    "the optical depth increases by a factor of 10 when the dust forms , in accordance with the opacity increase .",
    "there is , however , a delay between the onset of dust formation and the time when the maximum optical depth is reached because the dust formation sets in earlier than a cloud becomes optically thick .",
    "this delay is sensitive to the characteristic time scale of the system .",
    "the gas / dust mixture will only be optically thick for the case of non - transparent dust particles depending also on the wavelength considered .",
    "glassy grains efficiently absorb in the far ir ( @xmath32 m ) and one might , depending on the observed wavelength , detect typical dust features and possibly even the rapid formation events which , however , may need to evolve on macroscopic scales to be observable .",
    "turbulent fluctuations do not seem to produce considerable variations in view of the space mean of the optical depth in the long term ( here @xmath33s ) if astronomical silicates are assumed as typical dust opacity carriers , though turbulent fluctuations are essential for the initiation of dust formation and eventually for the origin of large scale structures .",
    "[ [ dependence - on - mach - number ] ] dependence on mach number : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the use of dimensionless equations allows to describe the character of the model equations and their solution by a set of characteristic numbers .",
    "for instance , the mach number = 1 suggest a sound - like flow while mach number @xmath34 implies a quasi - static fluid field .",
    "this concerns only the mean behaviour of the reactive fluid",
    ". deviations from this can occur and a local rather than a global mach number may occasionally be considered .",
    "the mach number of the local turbulent fluctuations is always sub - sonic due to the underlying model of driven turbulence ( see @xcite ) in our simulations , m@xmath35 .",
    "the global mach number describes the turbulent energy input on the largest resolvable scale and has an indirect influence on m@xmath36 .",
    "however , the dust formation is a local process , and its onset is delayed in case of low global mach number .",
    "the overall pattern formation remains very much alike but needs longer times to evolve for smaller mach numbers .",
    "presently , two schools exist for modelling the large - scale structures of substellar atmospheres",
    ". both aim on the understanding of the physiochemical processes being responsible for the detected spectral appearance and the photometric variability .",
    "\\a ) the classic static model atmosphere includes  beside the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ",
    "an elaborate frequency - dependent ( static ) radiative transfer treatment assuring flux conservation also with regard to the convective flux treated in the mixing length approximation .",
    "the solution of the chemical equilibrium for hundreds of gaseous - and if needed also for solid - species closes the system of model equations .",
    "\\b ) multi - dimensional modelling originating from solar and engineering research .",
    "the complete time - dependent hydrodynamic equations are solved including energy conservation .",
    "the time - dependence and multi - dimensionality is payed by either a simplified radiative transfer treatment ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the treatment of the gas phase chemistry is very limited .",
    "only @xcite did include a time - dependent model for dust formation ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : lsr ] ) .",
    "it seems tempting to combine the advantage of the one ( e.g. frequency - dependent radiative transfer for spectrum interpretation ) with the advantage of the other ( e.g. hydrodynamic cloud formation ) .    what do we need to achieve such a goal ?    [ [ section-8 ] ]    a complete hydrodynamic modelling of a substellar atmosphere will need to solve the multi - scale problem inherent to any turbulent media .",
    "hence , we need a model able to describe the large scale hydrodynamic structures commonly ascribed to convection",
    ". the model must simultaneously describe the small - scale turbulent fluid field .",
    "one way to do so is to apply the method of the large eddy simulation ( les ) where the spatial and the associated time scale are resolved down to a cut - off length .",
    "the scales smaller than that must be represented by some appropriate subgrid model .",
    "a further challenge is the simulation of the physical system close to a quasi - static situation .",
    "numeric truncation errors may cause unwanted spurious effects which can accumulate in the course of the simulation .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    brown dwarfs are shown to be fast rotators ( see scholz & eislffel this conference ) and we know from jupiter that rotation shapes its initially intermittent atmosphere .",
    "rotation will introduce a day / night behaviour and tides on the scale of the entire globe .",
    "it is , hence , a large - scale process and a globe - sized simulation will be needed .",
    "so far , only rotation free simulations are available for brown dwarfs .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    for spectrum interpretation and for a correct atmospheric temperature - density structure , the photon - matter interaction has to be modelled .",
    "huge data bases with millions of lines for the various molecules of interest ( h@xmath4o , tio , tic , tih , co , sio , vo , ch@xmath37 , cah , crh , feh , h@xmath38o , nh@xmath38 , ph@xmath38 , cia h@xmath4 ) and others , which influence the thermal structure but not show up in spectral features , are available and under construction . obeying observational evidence , atomic data are needed as well as good models for line profiles ( k  i , na  i , ca  ii ; rb  i , cs  i ) .",
    "multi - dimensional and time - dependent simulations are not able to handle such amounts of data which makes the 1d models the best and only tool for detailed spectrum interpretation also in the far future . however , the radiative transfer in spatially inhomogeneous media may need further attention also in substellar objects since it can support structure formation in dusty media where e.g. shadow casting is a major effects ( see question by steinacker ) .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    so far , time - dependent models were presented which include only a very simple model for the chemical gas phase composition of the dust forming gas .",
    "our work in progress allows to calculate the chemical equilibrium among 33 molecules and the conservation in space and time of 10 elements which is sufficient for the study of heterogeneous dust formation .",
    "it may be necessary to study chemical non - equilibrium effects influencing the composition of the gas phase .",
    "such effects may be important if the chemical reaction time is considerably smaller than the time on which the local temperature and density changes , which require that convection is much faster than chemistry .",
    "chemical equilibrium , in contrast , holds if the chemical reactions are much faster than the hydrodynamic changes .",
    "since photochemical processes are irrelevant in inner substellar atmospheric regions , the above ideas are concerned with the local thermo- and hydrodynamic condition , or in other words , it can be considered in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "hence , observation of co and ch@xmath37 for instance in gl  229b do not necessarily mean that the convective time scale is smaller than the chemical reaction time for these molecules .",
    "it may very well be that a convective cell of hot gas with its respective chemical equilibrium composition travels upward and is detected in a considerable cooler surrounding . however , the local conditions inside this cell are appropriate for the presence of co and the other gas compounds in chemical equilibrium since they are not influence by the surrounding nor by photo - processes yet . hence , there are at least two reasons not to expect chemical non - equilibrium : 1 ) the atmospheres are almost entirely convective thereby providing a efficient mixing mechanism , and 2 ) substellar atmospheres are very dense , hence , the chemical time scales are very small due to high collision rates .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    first steps for understanding dust formation and for providing a consistent description for substellar atmospheres are made ( see sect .  [ sec : lsr ] ) .",
    "so far , the extended model equation for dust formation which include the drift effect have not be solved consistently inside a model atmosphere .",
    "note that the formation process of dust is a non - equilibrium process since it takes place far away from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the gas needs to be substantially over - saturated , only then the phase transition is kinetically possible .    the next crucial step may be the consideration of coagulation processes .",
    "coagulation is likely to play a role in the inner , drift dominated atmospheric layers . here the drift may cause grain - grain collision and thereby an non - continuous , jump - like dust growth process leading to much larger dust grains than we presently do predict .",
    "we have presented work on two entirely different scale regimes of substellar atmospheres , one dealing with the observational large - scale regime and the other dealing with the small - scale regime where structure formations can be initiated .",
    "this allows us to cautiously draw a picture which sketches processes and interactions most relevant to rain and cloud formation in substellar atmospheres .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] summarises the expected large scale structure as well as the small scale structure formation due to turbulence seen as a zoom in into the large scale structures of the atmosphere .",
    "first , the turbulent character of a substellar atmosphere does allow the formation of grains in else - wise dust - hostile regions , i.e. further inside the atmosphere .",
    "the constantly occurring wave input from e.g. colliding convection cells causes the dust to form and later to gather into larger and larger structure ( clouds ) which can block radiation and cause backwarming due to the high opacity of dirty dust grains .",
    "second , the dust formation does very likely occur inside elemental rich , upstreaming gaseous material .",
    "once first seed particles have formed , they immediately start to sink into deeper , much denser atmospheric layer . during this travel",
    "the particle grow to @xmath39 m sized grains and speed up their fall as they get larger .",
    "the region of seed formation is characterised by very small grains and a high metal deficiency .",
    "the dust particles each their maximum size in deep layers , just at the borderline of thermal stability .",
    "what we know from earth rain we find also for brown dwarfs , the rain drops simply path through some atmospheric regions before they hit the ground or evaporate as it is in the case of brown dwarfs and giant gas planets .",
    "hence , there is a distinct upper and lower boundary where the dust clouds are to be expected .",
    "the upper borderline is related to th condition that enough condensable elements must be mixed upwards , the lower borderline is given by the condition of thermal stability .",
    "it is clear from thermodynamic arguments , that the cloud layer sinks deeper into the atmosphere as cooler the object is and visa versa .",
    "it is , hence , not surprising that cooler substellar objects do appear more metal deficient .",
