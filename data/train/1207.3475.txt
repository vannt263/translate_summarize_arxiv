    "in the last few decades , polymer physics has attracted considerable attention within the scientific community , with various polymer networks proposed to describe the structures of macromolecules  @xcite . among numerous polymer networks , cayley trees and vicsek fractals",
    "are two important ones , both of which have a treelike structure for modeling dendrimers and regular hyperbranched macromolecules , respectively .",
    "the treelike dendrimers consist of repeating units arranged in a hierarchical , self - similar way around a central core  @xcite .",
    "these special properties make them promising candidates for a large number of applications , e.g. , light harvesting antennae  @xcite . because of their practical significance",
    ", much attention has been devoted to the investigation of dendrimers  @xcite .    despite that dendrimers are of theoretical and practical interest , from the view point of chemistry , they are not simple to prepare  @xcite .",
    "thus , another class of polymers without this deficiency is desirable , which are hyperbranched polymers that are much easier to synthesize  @xcite",
    ". some hyperbranched polymers may be regular fractals , a particular example of which is the classic vicsek fractals , which were first introduced in  @xcite and were extended in  @xcite . as one of the most important regular fractals , vicsek fractals have attracted extensive interest  @xcite and continue to be an active object of research in various areas  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , a fundamental topic in polymer physics is to reveal how the underlying topologies of polymeric materials influence their dynamic behavior  @xcite . among plethora dynamical processes",
    ", trapping is a paradigmatic one , which is a kind of random walk with a deep trap fixed at a given position , absorbing all walkers that visit it .",
    "many dynamical processes in macromolecular systems can be described as a trapping process , e.g. , lighting harvesting  @xcite .",
    "a basic quantity relevant to the trapping problem is the trapping time ( tt ) , commonly called the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , for general random walks  @xcite .",
    "the tt for a node @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath1 , is the expected time for a walker starting from @xmath0 to reach the trap for the first time . the average trapping time ( att ) , @xmath2 , is defined as the average of @xmath1 over all source nodes in the system other than the trap , which provides a useful indicator for the efficiency of trapping . thus far , trapping problem has been extensively studied for various complex systems , such as regular lattices  @xcite , the sierpinski gasket  @xcite , the @xmath3fractal  @xcite , as well as various scale - free graphs  @xcite .",
    "however , trapping problem for cayley trees and vicsek fractals is still not well understood , in spite of that they well describe these two important classes of polymers .    in this paper , we study analytically the trapping issue in cayley trees and vicsek fractals , which are typical polymer networks .",
    "their special structures make them promising candidates as artificial antennae , with their centers being the fluorescent traps .",
    "we thus focus on a special case of the trapping problem with the trap placed at the central node .",
    "we will determine closed - form formulae of att for both polymer networks , by taking the advantage of the specific constructions of the polymer systems .",
    "the obtained explicit expressions indicate that for very large systems the dominating scalings of att for the two systems display distinct behaviors with respect to the system sizes .",
    "our work sheds some lights on the concerned trapping problem , providing some relevant relation information between trapping efficiency and underlying geometry of the system .",
    "here , we introduce the constructions and some properties of cayley trees and vicsek fractals as two representative models of polymer networks . both networks are defined in an iterative way .",
    "their particular constructions allow for precisely analyzing their properties and obtaining explicit closed - form solutions for various dynamical processes on large but finite structures .",

    "the random - walk model considered here is a simple one . at each discrete time step ,",

    "our work unveils that the geometry of macromolecules has a substantial influence on the trapping efficiency in polymer networks .",
    "actually , in addition to the trapping problem , other dynamics for cayley trees and vicsek fractals also display quite different behaviors , e.g. , relaxation  @xcite and energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the dynamics is , in all three cases , determined by the topological structures of the polymer networks .",
    "although the physical situations and measurements of these three dynamics are distinct , they are related to one another , since they all are encoded in eigenvalues of matrices ( transition matrix for trapping problems  @xcite , laplacian matrix for the other two dynamics  @xcite ) of the polymer networks , which reflect the global topological properties of the underlying structures .",
