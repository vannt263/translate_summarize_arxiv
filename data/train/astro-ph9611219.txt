    "in a companion paper ( paper i : jones et al . 1996 ) , we report the discovery with the ryle telescope ( rt ) of a cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) decrement towards the @xmath9 quasar pair pc1643 + 4631  a  &  b. we argue there that the decrement is most likely to be due to the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect caused by a system with mass @xmath0 but lying beyond the range of x - ray telescopes .    to further constrain the nature and distance of the system causing the cmb decrement ,",
    "we have carried out @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-band imaging of the field with the optical 4.2-m wht ( william herschel telescope , la palma , canary islands ) and the 3.8-m ukirt ( uk infrared telescope , hawaii ) .",
    "in addition , we have used the wht to obtain spectrophotometry of quasars a & b at higher sensitivity and resolution than previously reported because , as it proceeded , our investigation increasingly pointed to the possibility that quasars a & b are physically related .",
    "all observations were carried out in the period 1995 june to august , all in photometric conditions and with a maximum airmass of 1.3 . the imaging is described first and then the spectrophotometry .",
    "we take @xmath12kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath4- and @xmath5-band images were obtained with the ukirt ircam3 camera , on a scale of 029  pixel@xmath13 . for @xmath3-band imaging we used the tek  1024 ccd mounted on the auxilliary port of the wht , giving 022  pixel@xmath13 after binning . in each case",
    "the useful field size was @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in order to cover as big a region around the decrement as practicable , we observed in each band the seven fields whose centres are given in table 1 .",
    "individual @xmath4 and @xmath5 frames of each field were dithered in a @xmath17 grid with 12  steps to avoid repeating bad pixels .",
    "consecutive grids were offset by 2 .",
    "for each of fields  06 , the total integration time was 27  min in @xmath4 and 45  min in @xmath5 .",
    "the infrared seeing was 115 fwhm , but telescope judder elongated the images to 2  fwhm . in @xmath3 , a 5-min integration time was used for each of fields 16 and 10 min for field 0 ; seeing was 15 fwhm .",
    "images of photometric standard stars were taken throughout .",
    "the optical and infrared images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and flux - calibrated using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the limiting magnitudes for point sources ( 3-@xmath18 within 15 radius ) are as follows : for field  0 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; for fields  16 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "optical spectrophotometry was carried out at the wht using the red and blue arms of the isis spectrograph simultaneously . with gratings of 158 line  mm@xmath13 and tek ccds , we obtained continuous coverage from 3500   to 8500 and a spectral resolution of 12-  fwhm .",
    "a 2-wide slit was used with typical seeing 0912 fwhm .",
    "exposures of spectrophotometric standards were taken routinely . in this way ,",
    "spectra were obtained for quasars a and b , each with an integration time of 25 min , and also for objects close to the decrement centre , typically with 1015  min exposures .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding and flux calibration were done using iraf .",
    "to search for a candidate cluster , we classified objects in the field by colour .",
    "we measured magnitudes ( integrated over a 3-radius aperture ) for all objects detected in @xmath5 in the seven fields , except for stars and bright galaxies which were obviously nearby .",
    "[ mosaic ] shows the composite @xmath5 image .",
    "all objects with @xmath23 ( the 3-@xmath18 photometry limit is @xmath24 ) are marked with a colour - dependent symbol , except for very bright objects and objects at the extreme periphery of the composite .",
    "the form of the symbol is governed by the redness ( @xmath25 ) of the object .",
    "a cross is added if @xmath26 , perhaps indicative of a high - redshift elliptical ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "the immediate result is that in these deep images no cluster capable of causing the decrement is evident .",
    "we do see red galaxies with @xmath26 both around quasar  a and in the southern part of the composite , including the red galaxies found by hu & ridgway ( 1994 ) . if these galaxies with @xmath27 lie at @xmath28 , as their colours suggest , they would be as luminous as the brightest galaxies in low - redshift clusters ( aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ) , i.e. have luminosities greater than a few @xmath29 .",
    "a band of objects can also be seen across the field , mostly with @xmath30 .",
    "we obtained spectra for some of these : the four objects marked `` s '' on fig .",
    "[ mosaic ] turned out to be stars ; object 1 ( @xmath31 ) is an emission - line galaxy with strong [ oii]@xmath323727 and h-@xmath33 at @xmath34 ; objects 2 and 3 are companion galaxies with [ oii ]  emission at @xmath35 ( object 2 is not detected in @xmath4 or @xmath5 but has @xmath36 ; object 3 has @xmath37 ) .",
    "we reiterate that these observations do _ not _ reveal evidence of a cluster near the decrement position , implying the cluster is distant .",
    "> from our knowledge of the cluster luminosity function at @xmath38 ( e.g. aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ) , a cluster at , for example , @xmath39 should have a brightest member of @xmath40 and several tens of members present brighter than @xmath41 .",
    "this is clearly not observed  recall our 3-@xmath18 photometry limit over a 3-radius aperture is @xmath24 . following this argument",
    ", our images imply that any `` normal '' , s - z - producing cluster must lie at about @xmath42 or beyond .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray result of paper i. the existence of a significant population of such clusters is not favoured by current `` bottom - up '' models of structure formation ( e.g. cold dark matter , see e.g. peebles 1993 ) .    of course",
    ", one can speculate that the cluster is , compared with known clusters , underluminous in x - rays because the electron density , @xmath43 , is low , and underluminous in the optical / infrared because because its galaxies have burned out ( see silk 1986 ) or little star formation has occured in it .",
    "however , to produce an s - z signal , the line - of - sight pressure integral @xmath44 must be maintained , so a system with mass @xmath0 is _ still _ required .",
    "given that a massive system must lie in the direction of the decrement , gravitational lensing will occur .",
    "moreover , if the system lies at @xmath45 it will affect the apparent ( `` object '' ) positions of quasars a & b. to investigate the unlensed ( `` source '' ) positions of a & b , we have carried out simple modelling subject to the additional constraint that the lens gas causes an s - z effect of the observed magnitude ( see paper i ) .",
    "we employed the lensing formulation of blandford & narayan ( 1992 ) and a standard spherically - symmetric `` @xmath33-model '' to describe the s - z - producing gas . in this model",
    "the density is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the core - radius ( see e.g. cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) .",
    "we have assumed @xmath48 and a temperature of @xmath49  k , both typical of known x - ray clusters . as a first approximation",
    ", we placed the lensing mass at @xmath42 , adopted a ratio of total mass to gas mass of 10:1 , and made the lens and s - z centres coincident .    by adjusting the values of @xmath47 and @xmath50",
    ", we determined the source positions as a function of cluster gas distribution .",
    "intriguingly , a distribution with @xmath51 ( 300kpc ) and @xmath52 m@xmath53 both produces the s - z decrement observed with the rt and makes the source positions of quasars a & b _ almost coincident _",
    "( within 10 ) .",
    "the einstein - ring radius is @xmath54 and the total mass , including dark matter , within a 1-mpc radius of the centre is @xmath55 .",
    "it is remarkable that these values of core radius and mass are completely typical of known luminous clusters .",
    "the values are not particularly sensitive to @xmath33 or @xmath56 , nor to the redshift of the lens ( the mass required changes by less than fifty percent for @xmath57 ) . in other words , @xmath58 is fixed by the s - z decrement , and if one takes gas parameters similar to those of known clusters , the gravitational - lensing effects are such that the source positions of a & b must be close together .",
    "of course , minor adjustments to the assumed lens potential could make the quasar source positions coincide exactly .",
    "then quasars a & b would be double images of the same object .",
    "this would be by far the largest - separation multiple - image known .",
    "at least one other image would be expected but it could easily be fainter than our current magnitude limits .",
    "the possibility that quasars a & b are the same object compelled us to compare their spectra as closely as possible .",
    "the wht spectra we obtained for quasars a & b ( see fig . [ qsospectra ] ) have higher spectral resolution and sensitivity and extend further into the blue than those published by schneider et al .",
    "we confirm their broad - line redshifts and damped ly-@xmath59 absorption at @xmath60 in the spectrum of quasar a. the continuum shapes , line strengths and widths are similar in both quasars and two additional features in common are particularly striking .",
    "first , narrow absorption is clearly present in both objects , in both ly@xmath59@xmath321216 and civ@xmath32@xmath321549,1551 , shifted in both spectra @xmath61  kms@xmath13 to the blue of the line peaks .",
    "second , abrupt lyman - limit absorption is seen in the light from both quasars at the same redshifts as the narrow absorption features .",
    "associated lyman - limit systems are seen in about 20% of quasars with @xmath62 selected for absorption - line studies ( lanzetta 1991 ; storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1994 ) , although the probability of detecting two systems with similar relative velocities is much smaller . for intervening systems , a comoving number density of 0.06 lyman - limit absorbers per line of sight",
    "is expected within a redshift interval of 0.02 at @xmath63 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "we note that associated lyman - limit systems will follow a different redshift distribution if they are affected directly by the quasar environment , which is likely .",
    "however , despite the qualitative similarity of spectral features and gaseous environments , the redshift difference between quasars a & b remains significant .",
    "we find the redshifts of the broad emission lines in quasars a & b to differ by @xmath64  kms@xmath13 , with a similar difference for the lyman - continuum and narrow civ absorption , and find a difference in narrow ly@xmath59  absorption of @xmath65  kms@xmath13 .",
    "for quasars a & b to be two gravitationally - lensed images of one source , their one - percent redshift difference has to be explained by intrinsic spectral changes occuring over the likely delay between the two lightpaths , @xmath66 years .",
    "we note that velocity shifts , comparable with those observed between quasars a & b , have been observed between high- and low- ionisation emission lines in numerous quasar spectra and interpreted as evidence for radial velocities within the broad - line region ( blr ) ( see gaskell 1982 ; wilkes 1986 ) .",
    "such a radial , or bulk , velocity that changes over @xmath66 years would provide an explanation for the velocity differences of quasars a & b ; it is reassuring that the bulk - velocity changes of 3000  kms@xmath13 are less than the random spread ( ly@xmath59  and civ  have fwzi of @xmath67 and @xmath68  kms@xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "a model involving a disk ( perhaps warped and twisting due to an interaction ) and outflow together with the effects of shielding can explain the velocity differences _ provided _ the shifts of the narrow absorption features are tied to the shifts of the broad emission lines .",
    "this amounts to a requirement that the absorbing gas lies in or immediately adjacent to the blr , rather than at kpc - scale distances in the narrow emission - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "we next argue that this is plausible .",
    "the large optical depth ( @xmath69 ) in the lyman - limit absorption trough suggests that both quasars are viewed through a neutral hydrogen column of at least @xmath70  m@xmath71 ( e.g. sargent 1988 ) .",
    "furthermore , the measured equivalent width  emission .",
    "] of the strongest absorption feature in the ly@xmath59  emission line , @xmath72@xmath73  in quasar  a ( @xmath74  in quasar  b ) , corresponds to a range of column densities @xmath75  m@xmath71 using a curve - of - growth analysis ( e.g.  spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "taking a representative blr density of @xmath76  m@xmath53 ( e.g.  osterbrock 1993 ) , assuming the neutral hydrogen has the same temperature as the blr and is in pressure balance with it and has a filling factor of @xmath77 , these column densities correspond to line - of - sight distances of @xmath78@xmath79  m , i.e. much less than a parsec . taking a spherical geometry ,",
    "the corresponding upper limit for the hi mass is @xmath80 .",
    "these parameters suggest the amount of material needed to absorb ly@xmath59  in the quasar is easily containable within the blr .    a critical test of the notion that the spectra of a & b are of",
    "the same quasar seen at different times would be to see if narrow lines such as [ oiii]@xmath325007 ( in the infrared ) lie at the same redshift in both spectra ; such lines from the large nlr will not vary over @xmath66 years .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5- imaging of the field around pc1643@xmath814631  a  &  b has not revealed a cluster in the direction of the cmb decrement .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath79-@xmath82 cluster producing the decrement is similar to known massive clusters , it must lie at about @xmath6 or beyond .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray - based argument of paper i.    \\(2 ) if the system causing the decrement lies significantly nearer than @xmath6 , it must contain far fewer luminous galaxies than the nearer clusters known to cause s - z effects .",
    "it must also be larger , hotter and more rarefied than known clusters in order to give a lower @xmath83 ( and hence lower x - ray luminosity ) and yet give the observed s - z decrement .",
    "\\(3 ) if the massive 1643@xmath814631 system is a member of a significant population , then neither the higher-@xmath7 picture in ( 1 ) nor the lower-@xmath7 picture in ( 2 ) appears consistent with current cold - dark - matter theories of cluster formation .",
    "\\(4 ) whether ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) applies , the @xmath84 required to produce the decrement must gravitationally lens background objects . assuming the mass lies in front of the quasars , simple modelling , producing simultaneously the s - z effect and lensing , shows that the source positions lie within 10  of each other .",
    "\\(5 ) a slight adjustment to the assumed lens potential would make the quasar source positions coincide . if a & b are two images of one quasar , then the one - percent difference in broad - emission and narrow - absorption velocities , in otherwise very similar spectra , has to be explained .",
    "we have argued that this is possible given ( a ) the expected @xmath66 year difference in light travel time along the two paths , and ( b ) a system with a changing systematic velocity component in which narrow - line absorption takes place in the same region as the broad - line emission ; we have shown that the mass and size of the required absorption region are small enough that this is plausible .",
