    "entanglement is at the heart of many paradoxes of quantum mechanics and is also a useful ressource in quantum information processing . in particular ,",
    "entangled states play a key role in quantum error correction and in quantum computational speedup .",
    "the characterization of entanglement of a general multipartite state remains a mathematical challenge and there exist several inequivalent measures .",
    "a comprehensive account of the most important mathematical concepts used for quantifying and manipulating entangled states may be found in @xcite .",
    "some properties of entangled states may also be approached from differential geometry ( two- and three - qubit hilbert space geometry corresponds to hopf fibrations , that are entanglement sensitive @xcite ) , from topological spaces ( for instance the @xmath15-qubit ghz state corresponds to a borromean ring @xcite ) , from finite geometries ( by using the hyperplanes of the relevant generalized quadrangles @xcite or in the black - hole analogy @xcite .",
    "besides , group theoretical concepts have been repetitively put forward for describing classical @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite . in this paper , we exploit the unnoticed but organic link between real entangling gates of quantum computation and the group of automorphisms of some highly symmetric even euclidean lattices .",
    "let us define an @xmath11-dimensional euclidean lattice @xmath8 as a discrete additive subgroup of the real vector space @xmath0 , endowed with the standard euclidean product , and spanned by a generator matrix @xmath16 with rows in @xmath0 .",
    "the automorphism group @xmath7 is the set of orthogonal matrices @xmath9 such that under the conjugation action by the generating matrix @xmath16 , one gets a unimodular matrix @xmath17 , that is ( i ) @xmath18 and ( ii ) @xmath19 is an integer matrix ( see @xcite , p. 90 ) .",
    "when the degree @xmath11 is equal to the number of basis elements of @xmath8 , then @xmath12 also acts on basis vectors and is generated with matrices @xmath9 such that the sum of squared entries in a row is one , i.e. @xmath9 may be seen as a quantum gate .    it will be shown that for a suitable choice of even euclidean lattices @xmath8 such as @xmath20 lattices , the root lattices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the barnes - wall lattice @xmath21 , the lattice @xmath4 and the leech lattice @xmath5 , one observes that the orthogonal group @xmath7 is a group of entangling _",
    "quantum gates_. it can be considered as acting on a two- , three- , four- , a two - qubit / qutrit and a three - qubit / qutrit system , respectively .",
    "in retrospect , such lattices bear out our recent work relating @xmath1 and @xmath2 weyl groups to entangled states arising from the joint basis of specific mutually commuting set of generalized pauli observables @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our topic , let us start with the @xmath20 lattice whose lattice points are the integers and whose basis @xmath16 is the identity matrix .",
    "the elementary cell is the @xmath11-dimensional hypercube and the automorphism group is a wreath product @xcite @xmath22 of order @xmath23 , where the symbol @xmath24 denotes the semidirect product and the wreath product @xmath25 corresponds to a permutation action of the symmetric group @xmath26 on the @xmath11 copies of the two - letter group @xmath27 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the automorphism group @xmath28 of the four - dimensional lattice contains the gate cnot=@xmath29 , that is well known to create two - qubit entanglement .",
    "more precisely , taking the input qubit states as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the action cnot@xmath32 ends up into the non - separable bell state @xmath33 .",
    "as it is well known , the cnot gate is a primitive of universal quantum computing .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the entanglement arising from the two - qubit pauli group is encapsulated in the following mermin s square @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the ordinary pauli spin matrices .",
    "every row and every colum in the above square consists of mutually commuting operators sharing a basis of entangled states .",
    "the mermin s square may be used for a proof of the kochen - specker theorem in a four - dimensional space by observing that the algebraic relations for the eigenvalues @xmath10 of the observables contradicts the one for the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "let us denote @xmath38 and @xmath39 the first row and the r.h.s .",
    "column in ( [ msquare ] ) , the only ones that possess real entries .",
    "one may use the common eigenstate basis @xmath40 of the set @xmath41 for generating a lattice isometric to @xmath42 . the natural action of the automorphism group on the basis @xmath43 reads . ) ; l:=latticewithbasis(mr ) ; aut:=automorphismgroup(l : naturalaction ) ; l , aut ; \" ] @xmath44 it is noticeable that the rows of the generators @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath7 encode the eigenstates of the triples of observables @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ( a partial list of the eigenstates , associated to the maximal sets of mutually commuting operators in the two - qubit pauli group , may be found in @xcite ) .    then",
    ", following a similar reasoning , we construct the @xmath49 lattice by means of a generating basis built from the eigenstates of the following triple of three - qubit observables @xmath50 that follows from @xmath47 by applying the left tensor product @xmath37 .",
    "the basis we select is the matrix @xmath51 first introduced in @xcite ( eq . ( 9 ) ] . as for the two - qubit case above",
    ", the natural action of the automorphism group on the basis is obtained as    @xmath52 the matrix @xmath53 is not made explicit but it has a similar form and properties as @xmath54 .",
    "let us now investigate the type of entanglement contained in the @xmath15-qubit generators / gates @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "we single out the state encoded by the fourth row of @xmath54 @xmath55 a quantitative measure of tripartite entanglement is the @xmath15-tangle @xcite @xmath56 which contains the four determinants + @xmath57 , @xmath58 , + @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    to quantify bipartite entanglement the strategy is as follows @xcite .",
    "take the density matrix @xmath61 of the @xmath15-qubit system and trace out over the bipartite subsystems to obtain a reduced density matrix @xmath62 .",
    "a measure of two - qubit entanglement is the tangle @xmath63 , with the concurrence @xmath64 , where the @xmath65 are non - negative eigenvalues of the product @xmath66 arranged in decreasing order , @xmath67 is the spin - flipped density matrix and @xmath68 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "two important families are the ghz family with @xmath69 and all @xmath70-tangles @xmath71 vanishing , and the @xmath72 family with @xmath73 and all @xmath70-tangles equal to 1 .",
    "both families are unequivalent under slocc transformations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-tangle of the state ( [ state ] ) is @xmath74 and the reduced density matrices for subsystems @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the set of eigenvalues of @xmath66 associated to subsystems @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath81 leading to the tangles @xmath82 and the set of eigenvalues of @xmath66 associated to the subsystem @xmath77 is @xmath83 leading to a vanishing tangle @xmath84 .",
    "all states encoded by rows of @xmath54 and @xmath53 behaves as state ( [ state ] ) .",
    "we call a tripartite entanglement characterized by the tangles @xmath85 and @xmath86 an _ incomplete balanced entanglement_. fully balanced tripartite entanglement is found in @xcite and in the next section below devoted to the @xmath2 lattice and other dense lattices .",
    "the family of barnes - wall lattices @xmath87 , of even dimension @xmath88 , is related to self - dual codes and the real clifford group .",
    "the first four members of the family , for @xmath89 to @xmath90 , are isomorphic to the densest known lattices of the corresponding dimension , i.e. the root lattices @xmath91 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the barnes - wall lattice @xmath3 .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath87 ( in dimension @xmath88 , @xmath92 ) corresponds to the real clifford group @xmath93 ( defined as the normalizer in the general orthogonal group @xmath94 of the generalized pauli group on @xmath11 real qubits : the notation comes from @xcite ) . for @xmath95 qubits , @xmath96 is @xmath2 and @xmath97 is the second largest maximal subgroup of @xmath98 , the derived subgroup of the weyl group @xmath6 . in the sequel , we concentrate on the entanglement arising from the lattices embodying two , three and four qubits , respectively .      among the several representations of the lattice @xmath1 , we select the one with basis @xmath99 , that has the automorphism group @xmath100 going back to ( [ autd4 ] ) , it is clear that the rows of the two generators of @xmath101 encode the ( entangled ) eigenstates of the triple @xmath47 ( as was the case for the generator @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , two - qubit maximal entanglement is at the heart of the symmetries of this representation on the lattice @xmath1 . the group @xmath101 , of order @xmath102 , is ( up to isomorphism ) the same object than the two - qubit real clifford group @xmath103 and the weyl group @xmath104 of the @xmath105-cell .      among the several representations of the lattice @xmath1",
    ", we select the one with basis    @xmath106 ,    @xmath107    that has the automorphism group    @xmath108 the group @xmath109 is of order @xmath110 .",
    "let us consider the state encoded by the first row of @xmath53 @xmath111 the tangles attached to the state ( [ stateb ] ) are calculated , as we did for the state ( [ state ] ) of the previous section .",
    "they are such that @xmath112 corresponding to fully _ balanced tripartite entanglement_. the same results holds for all states encoded by the rows of @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can conclude that this type of entanglement , first featured in @xcite , is a specific property of the lattice @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the @xmath15-qubit real clifford group @xmath97 of order @xmath113 is a maximal subgroup of @xmath114 ( the second largest one ) ; the largest maximal subgroup is the automorphism group @xmath115 of the lattice @xmath116 .    as a second representation of the lattice @xmath117 , we select the one obtained from the construction a \" on the extended hamming code @xmath118 $ ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath119 here we get two types of generators . in the generator @xmath54 ,",
    "the rows @xmath90 and @xmath120 encode non entangled states while the other rows encode a state such as @xmath121 with @xmath69 and vanishing @xmath70-tangles .",
    "such a state is of the ghz type . the second generator @xmath53 encodes states of the type ( [ state ] ) corresponding to incomplete balanced entanglement .",
    "for four real qubits , the clifford group is @xmath122 , of order @xmath123 , associated to the barnes - wall lattice @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we use construction b \" associated to the @xmath124 $ ] reed - muller code ( see @xcite , p. 141 ) .",
    "one gets two @xmath125 gates generating @xmath126 with rows encoding entangled states such as the factorizable state @xmath127 it is easy to quantify the residual tripartite entanglement of state ( [ state3 ] ) . using ( [ three ] )",
    ", one gets true tripartite entanglement @xmath69 corresponding to the ghz family .",
    "all states encoded by the rows in the generators of @xmath126 display vanishing @xmath90-tangle ( the four - tangle is calculated from the expressions given in @xcite ) . presumably , all residual three - tangles equal unity as for ghz - type states ) .",
    "the unique indecomposable @xmath128-dimensional unimodular lattice is @xmath4 .",
    "it can be generated from the construction a \" applied to the @xmath129 $ ] extended golay code over @xmath130 .",
    "the automorphism group is of order @xmath131 . as for the previous cases , the rows of the generators encode entangled states . if we look at the system as a bipartite @xmath132 system , the schmidt rank with entries in an euclidean ring ( a field @xmath133 , the ring @xmath134 of integers , the ring @xmath135 $ ] of polynomials with coefficients over a field @xmath133 ... ) . given an @xmath136 matrix @xmath137 over an euclidean ring @xmath138 , one can find invertible square matrices @xmath139 and @xmath140 such that @xmath141 , where @xmath45 is a diagonal matrix : the smith normal form of @xmath137 .",
    "this is equivalent to the singular value decomposition @xmath142 .",
    "the non - zero diagonal entries of the smith form of @xmath137 are unique up to multiplication by a unit of @xmath138 and are also called elementary divisors . thus , the schmidt rank of @xmath137 equals the rank of @xmath45 .",
    "] of the generators is found to be three .",
    "there are several types of states .",

    "if the partial transpose matrix @xmath153 has negative eigenvalues , then the bipartite system @xmath75 is entangled .",

    "the sets of eigenvalues of matrices @xmath155 are @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively .",

    "one can see the states encoded by the rows of the two generators as coming grom a @xmath163 quantum system and for them one finds that the schmidt rank is four .",
