    "`` correlated electron systems '' ( such as transition metal oxides ) are materials in which strong electron - electron or electron - lattice interactions produces behavior incompatible with the standard `` density functional plus migdal - eliashberg '' theory which describes most compounds . the past decade has seen tremendous progress in the physics and materials science of correlated - electron systems .",
    "significant improvements in crystal and film growth , in measurement techniques and in theory have led to a much improved understanding of the bulk properties of these materials .",
    "an important finding is that correlated electron systems exhibit a multiplicity of interesting phases ( superconducting , magnetic , charge and orbitally ordered ) along with associated novel excitations . for recent reviews ,",
    "see ref .  , or the articles in ref .",
    "the recent success in treating bulk properties suggests that the time is ripe for a systematic study of the surface and interface properties of correlated electron systems .",
    "in addition to its basic importance as a fundamental question in materials science , correlated electron surface / interface science should provide the necessary scientific background for study of potential devices exploiting correlated electron properties , because essentially any device must be coupled to the rest of the world via motion of electrons through an interface , and for study of correlated electron nanostructures , because essentially the defining property of a nanostructure is a high surface to volume ratio .",
    "the fundamental interest of bulk correlated electron materials lies in the novel phases they exhibit , and we therefore suggest that the fundamental issue for the nascent field of `` correlated electron surface science '' is `` how does the electronic phase at the surface differ from that in the bulk '' ; in other words , `` what is the electronic surface reconstruction . ''",
    "this question has begun to attract experimental attention .",
    "hesper and co - workers have shown that the [ 111 ] surface of k@xmath0c@xmath4 differs from bulk because of charge transfer caused by a polar surface.@xcite matzdorf and collaborators have demonstrated that in the correlated electron system ca@xmath5sr@xmath6ruo@xmath0 ( which exhibits mott metal - insulator transition ) , the surface layers remain metallic down to a lower temperature than does the bulk system.@xcite izumi and co - workers have fabricated `` digital heterostructures '' composed of different transition metal oxides and have demonstrated changes in electronic phase and other properties depending on the thicknesses of different layers.@xcite in an experimental tour - de - force , ohtomo , muller , grazul , and hwang have demonstrated the fabrication of atomically precise digital heterostructures involving a controllable number @xmath7 of planes of latio@xmath0 ( a correlated - electron mott - insulating material ) separated by a controllable number @xmath8 of planes of srtio@xmath0 ( a more conventional band - insulating material ) and have measured both the variation of electron density transverse to the planes and the dc transport properties of the heterostructure.@xcite their work opens the door to controlled studies both of correlated electron physics in confined dimensions and of the behavior of the interface between a correlated system and a uncorrelated one .",
    "many physics and material science issues arise in considering the behavior of correlated electrons near surfaces and interfaces .",
    "atomic reconstruction may occur , and may change the underlying electronic structure .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .   argue that a change in tilt angle of the surface ruo@xmath9 octahedra increases the electronic hopping , thereby allowing the metallic phase to persist to lower @xmath10 . also , as noted e.g. by hesper and collaborators , a change in structure will lead to changes in madelung potentials , and to the screening which helps define the values of many - body interaction parameters.@xcite `` leakage '' of charge across an interface may change densities away from the commensurate values required for insulating behavior . substrate",
    "induced strain is well known to change the behavior of films.@xcite    sorting out the different contributions and assessing their effect on the many - body physics is a formidable task , which will require a sustained experimental and theoretical effort . the experiment of ohtomo _ et al . _ offers an attractive starting point . in this system , the near lattice match ( 1.5  % difference in lattice parameter ) and chemical similarity of the two components ( latio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 ) suggests that atomic reconstructions , strain , and renormalizations of many - body parameters are of lesser importance , so the physical effects of electronic reconstruction can be isolated and studied .",
    "further , the near fermi surface states are derived mainly from the ti @xmath1-orbitals,@xcite and correspond to narrow bands well described by tight - binding theory .",
    "however , the orbital degeneracy characteristic of ti provides an interesting set of possible ordered phases .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a theoretical analysis of the correlated electron behavior to be expected in lattice - matched digital heterostructures of the type created by ohtomo _",
    "et al_.@xcite we focus on electrons in the ti - derived bands , and include the effects of the long - ranged electric fields arising both from the la atoms and the electronic charge distribution .",
    "we treat the extra on - site interactions via a hartree - fock interaction .",
    "we calculate the electronic phase diagram as a function of on - site interaction parameter and number of la layers and for the relevant phases determine the spatial variation of charge , spin and orbital densities .",
    "we obtain a complex set of behaviors depending on interaction strength and number of la layers . generally , we find a crossover length of approximately three unit cells , so that units of six or more latio@xmath0 layers have a central region which exhibits bulk - like behavior .",
    "the outmost @xmath11 layers on each side are however metallic ( in contrast to the insulating behavior of bulk latio@xmath0 ) . for very thin superlattices the ordering patterns differ from bulk .",
    "we calculate optical conductivity spectra and show that this is a revealing probe of the electronic structure .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii defines the model , parameter values , and method of study .",
    "section iii presents our results for the @xmath12 phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and number of latio@xmath0 layers .",
    "section iv presents our results for the spatial dependence of the charge density in the small @xmath13 regime where neither spin nor orbital ordering occur and provides , for this simpler case , an overview of the general features of the electronic structure .",
    "section v studies the onset of spin and orbital order as the interaction and layer thickness are increased .",
    "section vi discusses in more detail the special case 1 layer .",
    "section vii study the interrelation between the metallic behavior and the subband structure , and a stability under parameter variation .",
    "section viii presents representative results for the optical conductivity , and shows how these may be used to elucidate the electronic structure .",
    "finally , section ix presents a summary of our findings and important future directions , and implications for the general questions of correlated electron surface and interface science , and is designed to be useful to readers uninterested in the details presented in sections ii - viii .",
    "both latio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 crystallize in the simple abo@xmath0 perovskite structure @xcite ( more precisely , very small distortions occur which we neglect here ) and as noted by ref .",
    "the lattice constants of the two materials are almost identical ; @xmath14   , minimizing structural discontinuities at the interface and presumably aiding in the growth of high quality digital heterostructures .    in this paper",
    "we consider an infinite crystal of srtio@xmath0 , into which @xmath7 adjacent [ 001 ] planes of latio@xmath0 have been inserted perpendicular to one of the ti - ti bond directions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "we choose the @xmath15 direction to be perpendicular to the latio@xmath0 planes , so the system has a ( discrete ) translation symmetry in the @xmath16 direction .",

    "the derived bands@xcite are to a good approximation given by a nearest neighbor tight binding model with hopping parameter of magnitude @xmath20  ev and spatial structure given by the slater - koster formula,@xcite so the @xmath21 states disperse only in the @xmath16 plane _",

    "we take the form of the on - site interactions determined by mizokawa _",

    "thus @xmath26   \\label{eq : htot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and similarly for @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 here the @xmath32 are the positions of the ti@xmath33 sites in the abo@xmath0 lattice and @xmath34 label the actual positions of the la ions , which reside on the a sites .",
    "we denote the dielectric function of the host lattice by @xmath35 .",
    "an interesting issue arises here : srtio@xmath0 is a nearly ferroelectric material.@xcite the static dielectric constant becomes very large at long wavelength and low temperatures , but @xmath35 is much smaller at high frequencies , room temperature , or short length scales . also the polarization @xmath36 will increase more slowly at higher fields , and relevant quantity is @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "we have chosen @xmath38 as a compromise between these effects .",
    "we discuss the consequences of different choices of @xmath39 in the conclusion .",
    "we emphasize that incorporating the ferroelectric tendencies of srtio@xmath0 ( including the associated lattice distortions ) in a more realistic manner is a important question for future research .    finally , the onsite @xmath40 is @xmath41 the critical issue is the strength of the on - site repulsion . for definiteness",
    "we follow other studies which employ the ratios @xmath42 and @xmath43 which are very close to those determined by mizokawa.mizokawa95 many workers have used the value @xmath44  ev  @xmath45 estimated from high energy spectroscopies.@xcite however , optical conductivity studies of latio@xmath0 and related compounds such as ytio@xmath0 find rather small gaps , in the range 0.2 - 1  ev , okimoto95 suggesting @xmath46  ev  @xmath47 . in view of this uncertainty",
    "we investigate a range @xmath13 from @xmath48-@xmath49 .    to study the properties of @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : htot ] ) , we employ the hartree - fock approximation replacing terms such as @xmath51 by @xmath52 ; orbitally off - diagonal expectation values @xmath53 of the type considered by mizokawa and mochizuki are stable only in the presence of a gdfeo@xmath0 type distortion which we do not consider . while not exact , the approximation reveals the correct trends and in particular reveals insulating , ordered states in the parameter regimes where these exist . to implement the hartree - fock approximation",
    "we assume an initial distribution of site , spin and orbital occupancies , obtain the one electron potential by factorizing the interaction terms as described below , compute the band structure , obtain new densities , and iterate until convergence is obtained for some @xmath13-values .",
    "many iterations ( @xmath54 ) are required to obtain well - converged solutions , essentially because of the delicate balance of particle distributions needed to screen the long range part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "there are two types of solutions to the one - electron equations : bound states , which decay as @xmath55 , and continuum states , which do not . as usual in heterostructure problems",
    "the bound states give rise to sub - bands , some of which are partially occupied .",
    "the ground state is obtained by filling the lowest sub - bands up to the appropriate chemical potential ( determined by charge neutrality ) ; the interaction - related terms in @xmath56 and @xmath57 are then recomputed and the procedure is repeated until self - consistency is obtained .",
    "charge neutrality requires that the total density of electrons in the bound - state sub - bands equals the total density of la ions .",
    "however , the interplay between electron - la attraction and electron - electron repulsion leads ( in almost all of the cases we have studied ) to a very weak binding of the highest - lying electron states ; indeed for large @xmath13 the fermi level of the partially filled sub - bands is only infinitesimally below the bottom of the continuum bands .",
    "also in some regions of the phase diagram , there are several locally stable solutions and it is necessary to compare energies , to determine the ground state . between 200 and 3000 iterations were required , with the larger number needed either when the fermi level adjoins the continuum states or when several different states are very close in energy .",
    "we now mention some specific details of our solution to the hartree - fock equations .",
    "we seek solutions which are bound in the @xmath15 directions ; i.e. functions @xmath58 which decay as layer index @xmath59 , and which depend on the transverse @xmath60 coordinates as discussed below .    for each orbital @xmath61 ,",

    "the term @xmath70 contains the dispersion in the plane of the layers , as well as terms arising from the long - ranges coulomb interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcoul ] ) ] and terms arising from the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "these terms depend on the on - site interactions and on the charge , spin and orbital density in layer @xmath71",
    ". a general mean - field state would break translation invariance in the @xmath16 plane , in a manner whose amplitude would depend on layer index @xmath71 , thereby mixing the motion in @xmath72 and @xmath15 directions , leading to a very numerically involved three dimensional self - consistency problem . in order to keep the computations within reasonable bounds and explore wide ranges of parameters , we have in most calculations restricted attention to state which preserve translational invariance in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "for these states the @xmath16 and @xmath15 motions decouple , and physical quantities may be computed from the solution of a 1@xmath1 problem combined with an integral over a two - dimensional momentum .",
    "we also performed some investigations of states with a two - sublattice @xmath16 plane structure . in this case , after fourier transformation on the in - plane coordinate the in - plane hamiltonian may be written @xmath73 with @xmath74 the part of the potential which is independent of sublattice , @xmath75 the part which alternates between sublattices and @xmath76 the in - plane dispersion in the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "the variation of the mixing term @xmath77 with layer requires a separate treatment , lengthening the numerical analysis considerably .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the calculated phase diagram .",
    "the geometry of the heterostructure distinguishes between the @xmath16 orbital and the @xmath78 orbitals .",
    "as noted above , we assume translation invariance in the @xmath16 plane . the symmetries which may be broken are therefore spin rotation and orbital rotation ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) and inversion along with translation invariance in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "also , although it does not have precise meaning except in the @xmath81 limit , it is physically sensible to interpret results in terms of @xmath15-direction translation symmetry breaking when the spin or orbital density oscillates with respect to the total charge density .",
    "our calculated phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . for reasons of computational convenience in scanning a wide range of parameters",
    ", we considered mainly phases with translation invariance in the @xmath16 plane , however for @xmath82 and @xmath83 we considered also an @xmath16-plane two sublattice symmetry breaking .",
    "we found in agreement with previous calculations @xcite that the fully staggered phase is favored at @xmath84 , but @xmath16-plane symmetry broken states could not stabilized in the one layer case .",
    "we have not yet studied more general symmetry breakings for intermediate layer numbers , but physical arguments presented below strongly suggests that these phases only occur for larger numbers of layers ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "four phases are found : a small @xmath13 phase with no broken symmetry , and intermediate @xmath13 phase with in - plane translation - invariance spin order , but no orbital order , and a large @xmath13 phase with both spin and orbital order .",
    "the lower @xmath13 transition line varies smoothly with layer number , while the larger @xmath13 transition is essentially independent of layer number for @xmath86 .",
    "further , the @xmath83 intermediate @xmath13 phase is ferromagnetic whereas for @xmath86 the intermediate @xmath13 phase is antiferromagnetic . as will be shown in sections below this behavior can be related to the sub - band structure but the essential reason is that for small @xmath7 the charge density is spread in the @xmath15 direction , so no layer has a density near 1 .",
    "= 0.8    = 0.8    for all @xmath7 , the lower-@xmath13 transition is found to be second order .",
    "as @xmath13 is increased above this value , the magnetization increases rapidly and the upper transition is strongly first order .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows an example of the procedure used to determine the location of the phase boundary and the order of the transition .",
    "the upper panel of figure  fig : energy displays the energies of several different phases .",
    "we identify @xmath87 as the point where the different energies converge ( this is most easily done from a plot , not shown , of the energy differences on a expanded scale ) and @xmath88 from the lowest crossing point of the energy curves .",
    "that the energies of two qualitatively different states cross at @xmath88 identifies this as a first order phase transition , that the energies merge at @xmath89 suggests a second order transition .",
    "further evidence is provided by panel ( b ) , which shows , on an expanded scale , the magnetization as a function of @xmath90 , and suggests a continuous decrease to zero .",
    "the comparison to the @xmath84 limit is subtle . in bulk",
    "latio@xmath0 exhibits a ( @xmath91 ) type antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "theoretical calculations ( apparently confirmed by very recent nmr experiment , and x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments)@xcite suggest a four sublattice structure which is very close to a ( @xmath92)-type orbital orderingmochizuki03 differing slightly from the ( @xmath92 ) ordering studied here . stabilizing the observed state",
    "apparently requires a lattice distortion not included in the model studied here . as @xmath13",
    "is increased from zero the @xmath93 limit of the model considered here has a phase transition which we believe to be of second order to an incommensurate antiferromagnetic state with a wave vector which is an extremal spanning vector of the fermi surfaces of the bands arising from two of the orbitals ( say @xmath94 ) and which turns out to be very close to ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "( in fact , for reasons of numerical simplicity we studied ( @xmath92 ) ordering and found a very weakly first order transition . ) this transition is followed by a strongly first order transition to one of a degenerate manifold of states characterized by ferromagnetic spin order and ( @xmath91 ) orbital order . to maintain continuity with the heterostructure calculations",
    "we have also suppressed the ( @xmath91 ) ordering and located the phase boundary to the ( metastable ) ( @xmath92)-orbital spin - ferromagnetic state .",
    "we believe the ( @xmath91)-orbital spin - ferro state we have found is a reasonable surrogate for the actual mochizuki - imada state found in experiment .",
    "although this state is favored at @xmath81 , the physical origin , explained below in more detail , of our inability to stabilize states with broken in - plane translation invariance at @xmath83 suggests that the ( @xmath95 ) phases only occur for rather thick superlattices .",
    "the essential point is that , for @xmath96 , the solution in the large @xmath13 limit consists of several partially filled sub - bands , which have effectively minimized their interaction energy but which gain considerable kinetic energy from motion in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "breaking of @xmath16 translation symmetry would reduce this kinetic energy gain without much decreasing the already saturated interaction energy while @xmath15-direction kinetic energy is quenched by the confining potential .",
    "the estimate of @xmath97 derived from optical measurements on bulk , and from the recent work on the nature of the ordered phase suggests an interesting series of phase transitions may occur as layer thickness is varied .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the results obtained for @xmath98 where no symmetry breaking is observed . although the system geometry implies @xmath16 and @xmath99 orbitals are inequivalent , the occupancies of those orbitals are found to be almost the same ; the ratio at the center cite is given by @xmath100 and 0.049 for @xmath101 and 3 , respectively , at @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we mainly focus on the spatial distribution of the total electron density below .",
    "= 0.8    numerical results for the electron density for several choices of la layer @xmath103 and @xmath104 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_tot ] .",
    "here we set the origin of @xmath15 axis at the center of @xmath7 la layers .",
    "electron density is symmetrically distributed around @xmath105 .",
    "the density at the center site rapidly increases with increasing @xmath7 , and exceeds 0.9 at @xmath106 .",
    "however , for this and larger @xmath107 values , the charge density never exceeds unity , even at the center sites .",
    "[ fig : n_tot ] shows clearly that for thick layers the length scale over which density vary is about three unit cells , and this number is almost independent of @xmath7 , and depends somewhat on @xmath35 and weakly on @xmath13.@xcite thus , at least 6 layers seem to be required before bulk behavior is recovered in the central region .",
    "as is well known , srtio@xmath0 is close to ferroelectric , and the long wave - length , and linear response dielectric constant becomes about 20000 at the lowest temperature.sakudo71 the present results involve @xmath35 at short scales , and are clearly outside the linear response regime .",
    "however , temperature dependent changes in the density profile should occur and are worth experimental study .",
    "another interesting feature to note is that for all @xmath39 and @xmath13 studied the electron and hole distributions at large @xmath7 are almost symmetric at the edge @xmath108 ; @xmath109 and @xmath110 fall on almost the same line ( not shown )",
    ".    it might be interesting to compare the present numerical results ( @xmath101 ) with the experimentally observed ti@xmath2 spatial distributions.ohtomo02 the observed ti@xmath2 decay length of ti@xmath2 is about 2  nm ( 5 unit cells ) in both @xmath83 and 2 , which is longer than the present theoretical results ( about 3 unit cells ) .",
    "the reported la - ion distribution suggests that the spatial resolution of the eels measurement is about 0.4  nm ( 1 unit cell ) .",
    "inclusion of such effect makes the density distribution profiles closer to the experimental ones , but the experimental distributions are still broader than the present theoretical ones .",
    "one possibility is la / sr interdiffusion ( not considered here ) .",
    "an alternate origin could be a chemical shift of the ti @xmath17 level .",

    "( although no site is fully polarized ) in contrast for @xmath83 and @xmath114 , the magnetic state is different : the spins align ferromagnetically .",
    "the behavior at @xmath83 can be attributed to the lower charge density at each site implying low occupancy of each sub - band , so a small shift between the up and down electron sub - bands can stabilize the fully polarized state . on the contrary ,",
    "ferrimagnetic spin ordering at @xmath115 comes from a delicate balance between the confinement potential and on - site coulomb repulsion .",

    "a tiny amount ( less than 1 % ) of down spin electrons exist only in the @xmath16 orbitals .",

    "the symmetry in @xmath16 is expected to be conserved because this symmetry is favorable to gain the kinetic energy by two dimensional electron motion .",

    "we have not found any stable states which break @xmath117 plane translational invariance .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : n_tot ] that at essentially all @xmath13 the occupancy of any particular orbital state is low . for @xmath118",
    "the orbital ordering in the @xmath15 direction ( say @xmath16 occupancy to the left of the la layer and @xmath80 occupancy to the right ) , along with the ferromagnetism effectively eliminates the on - site interaction contribution to the hartree - fock energy , while the fact that the one electron is shared between the two bands means that at each sub - band there is a large kinetic energy gain of order @xmath119 per sub - band .",
    "we believe this physics explains why we at @xmath83 have been unable to to stabilize a state with two - sublattice in - plane symmetry breaking . in bulk at large @xmath13 ,",
    "the kinetic energy is quenched and the ( @xmath91 ) state is stabilized relative to the ( @xmath92 ) state by a superexchange of approximately @xmath120 but in the @xmath83 superlattice the band energy gain is approximately @xmath119 .",
    "indeed this argument suggests that until the band filling becomes close to 1 ( which only happens for @xmath85 ) the kinetic energy gain in @xmath16-invariant states is larger than the superexchage energy gained by ordering so that for a range of small @xmath7 ( perhaps @xmath121 ) staggered in - plane ordering may be neglected .",
    "we do expect the @xmath16-translation invariant states we have found to be unstable to some form of weak incommensurate density wave ordering , because the resulting sub - band structure has a one - dimensional character from the @xmath122 and @xmath80 sub - bands .",
    "however , this ordering is expected to be weak because the residual interactions , not already included in our hartree - fock solution , are not strong .",
    "for example , in the @xmath123 regime , the on - site interactions are fully quenched by the ferromagnetic ordering so incommensurate charge density wave is driven only by the @xmath124 component of the long ranged coulomb interaction , which we estimate from the sub - band charge distribution with half width @xmath125 to be @xmath126 with @xmath127/\\sqrt{% 1+u^2 } \\approx 0.3 \\mbox{-}0.4 $ ] .",
    "for the parameters used here @xmath128 with @xmath129 , so the instability occurs at a very low @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig : nunoccu ] shows the changes in the density profile and in the occupancy of partially filled bands occurring if the on - site energy is changed for sites near @xmath139 sites . here",
    ", we have chosen the site energy of those @xmath137 sites which sit between two @xmath140 planes to be zero , the energy of a @xmath137 site between two @xmath139 planes to be @xmath141 and the energy of a @xmath137 site between a @xmath139 plane and a @xmath140 plane to be @xmath142 .",
    "for @xmath143 several partially filled bands exist , leading to a high density of metallic electrons .",
    "as @xmath144 is decreased , the electronic structure rapidly rearranges so that most bands become fully filled .",
    "however , even for the largest @xmath144 the geometry ensures that one electron always remains to be shared between two nearly degenerate bands , one on either side of the heterostructure , so the metallic behavior remains robust .",
    "= 0.7    = 0.7    we may similarly consider changes occurring as the dielectric constant is varied .",
    "[ fig : n6e_dep ] shows the paramagnetic phase density profile occurring as the dielectric constant is varied over a wide range .",
    "the main effect is to decrease the tailing of charge density far into the @xmath138 layer .",
    "however , there again remains one electron to be shared between the two edge subbands , the basic phenomenon of partly filled bands at the edge is unaffected .",
    "summarizing , for reasonable parameters we find that there are always partially filled bands , corresponding to metallic behavior at the heterostructure edges .",
    "the possibility of metallic behavior at the edge of a mott insulator system appears to be confirmed by the experimental results of ohtomo _",
    "et al_.@xcite would be interesting study further both experimentally and by more sophisticated theoretical methods .",
    "there are two classes of solutions to the hartree - fock equations : bound states , which have wave functions which decay as @xmath132 is increased away from the la layers , and continuum states , extended in all three directions . although the existence of sharply defined single - particle states at all energies is an artifact of the hartree - fock approximation , we expect this qualitative structure to survive in a more sophisticated treatment .",
    "therefore , in this section we use the hartree - fock approximation to show how optical conductivity can provide information on the nature and filling of the bound states .",
    "we also present a qualitative discussion of the effect of interactions beyond hartree - fock .",
    "we consider electric field directed perpendicular to the la - planes ( parallel to @xmath15 ) and use the peierls - phase approximation to determine the current operator @xmath145.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then evaluate the usual kubo formula using the hartree - fock eigenstates .",
    "note that in the nearest neighbor tight binding approximation the @xmath21 states do not couple to @xmath15-electric field , so we will not discuss them in this section .    figure .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n1 ] shows the calculated @xmath12 conductivity for the case of one la layer , and two values of @xmath13 : @xmath104 ( light curve ) , for which the system is in the spin and orbital disordered phase , and @xmath146 ( heavy curve ) , for which the system is in the ferromagnetic , orbitally disordered state .",
    "= 0.8    for @xmath104 the @xmath94 part of the spectrum ( shown in the lower left panel ) consists of one four - fold degenerate bound - state sub - band , containing approximately 1/6 electron per spin per orbital , as well as empty continuum bands .",
    "the optical spectrum therefore consists of one feature , corresponding to a bound - continuum state transition .",
    "the absorption is peaked at the bound state energy , the width reflects the degree of overlap between continuum and bound state energies .",
    "the oscillator strength is related to the kinetic energy in the @xmath15 direction , and is approximately @xmath147@xmath148/la .",
    "we expect this spectrum to be very little affected by correlation effects beyond hartree - fock , because the basic bound state energetics are fixed by charge neutrality and coulomb interaction , and the final states are continuum states , which are delocalized in space .    also shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n1 ] is the spectrum corresponding to @xmath83 and @xmath146 . for these parameters",
    "the electronic structure has changed ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n1 ] ) ; there are now two sub - bands ; one more strongly bound than in the @xmath104 case and holding more electrons ( but still only approximately 1/3 filled ) and one only very slightly filled band .",
    "the calculated @xmath149 correspondingly exhibits three features , a weak low energy ( @xmath150 ) feature arising from transitions from the very slightly filled bound to the continuum , a sharp higher energy ( @xmath151 ) feature arising from the intersubband transition ( allowed because the lower sub - band is even under @xmath152 and the upper is odd ) and a very broad feature from lower bound - continuum transitions .",
    "the intersubband transition contains about 2/3 of the total oscillator strength ; the remainder is mainly in the bound - state to continuum peak .",
    "we note that as expected on general grounds , the presence of a bound - state to bound - state transition sharply reduces the weight in the continuum ( compare @xmath153 ) , essentially because of the requirement that the continuum states be orthogonal to both bound states .    within the model we have used",
    "the intersubband transition is a delta function , because lifetime effects have been neglected and the @xmath72 and @xmath15 direction dispersions decouple , so the 2 sub - bands disperse in the same way as @xmath154 or @xmath155 is varied .",
    "the dispersions decouple because we have adopted a nearest neighbor tight binding model , however this is believed to be reasonably accurate in practice .",
    "a potentially more significant source of broadening is the `` hubbard @xmath13 '' interaction .",
    "experience from simpler models suggests that for these @xmath13-values ( of order of the critical value for the bulk system mott transition ) and electron concentration ( less than 0.4 electrons per layer , far from the mott value @xmath83 ) these effects are not too severe : essentially because the probability of 2 particle collisions scales as @xmath156 , only a small fraction of the spectral weight will be shifted to an `` upper hubbard band '' feature at an energy @xmath157 , and lifetime broadening will be rather less than the fermi energy , so roughly we expect the peak to remain unchanged .",
    "these arguments apply also to the other cases we consider below .",
    "we now discuss the @xmath113 case . in the small @xmath13 paramagnetic , orbital disordered case ,",
    "the electronic spectrum exhibits two bound - state sub - bands ; arising from a more strongly bound even parity state and a weakly bound odd parity state .",
    "the band structure is very similar to that shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n1 ]  ( b ) , but without spin polarization .",
    "the optical conductivity ( not shown ) is essentially the same as the @xmath146 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n1 ] .",
    "increasing @xmath13 to @xmath112 leads to a spin ordered ( here ferrimagnetic ) orbitally disordered state , with four sub - bands [ three below @xmath158 and partially occupied ] and correspondingly two bound - state to bound - state transitions ( one for each spin ) and three bound - state to continuum transitions ( the middle one of which is evidently extremely weak ) .    as a final example",
    ", we show the optical spectrum and energetics for the spin - ferro orbital - antiferro @xmath146 state .",
    "five bound states now occur , and correspondingly three sharp peaks ( recall the optical selection rule allows coupling only from even to odd parity states ) .",
    "four bound - state - continuum transition should be visible ( the highest - lying @xmath79 even parity state is essentially unoccupied ) but again all are weak and the lowest - lying ( arising from the odd @xmath159 band ) is especially weak because the low - lying even - parity continuum states must be orthogonal to the even - parity bound state , which absorbs all the oscillator strength .",
    "= 0.9    to summarize : the electronic spectrum consists of a number of different sub - bands ( with the detailed structure depending on number of la layers and on the nature of the ordering , if any ) .",
    "the optical spectrum for @xmath15-polarized light is predicted to consist of relatively sharp peaks , which may be assigned to the different optically allowed intersubband transitions , along with broad features ( often rather weak ) associated with transitions from sub - bands to the continuum .",
    "in this paper we studied theoretically the phase diagram and electronic properties of a `` correlated heterostructure '' model involving @xmath7 layers of a material which in bulk is a mott insulator , embedded in an infinite band insulator .",
    "the specific features of the model we study were chosen to reproduce the latio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 superlattice system studied by ohtomo _",
    "et al . _ , but we hope that our results will shed light also on the more general question of the physics of the interface between a strongly correlated and weakly correlated systems .    a crucial feature of the experimental latio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 system studied by ohtomo _",
    "is the almost perfect lattice match between the two systems .",
    "these authors argued that this implies that the only difference between the mott insulating and band insulating regions arises from the different charge of the la(3 + ) and sr(2 + ) ; in particular the crystal structure and atomic positions are expected to remain relatively constant throughout the heterostructure .",
    "of course , the asymmetry present at the latio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface must induce some changes in atomic positions : a tio@xmath160 octahedron is negatively charged , and so if it sits between a sr plane and a la plane it will be attracted to the latter , and also distorted , because the positively charged ti will tend to move in the opposite direction .",
    "the experimentally determined ti - ti distances shown in fig .  1 of ref .  , along with the distortion in that paper , suggests that the changes in ti - ti distance are negligible . in this circumstance ,",
    "changes in o position along the ti - o - ti bond change hoppings only in second order .",
    "we therefore neglected these effects and assumed that the electronic hoppings and interaction parameters remain invariant across the heterostructure .",
    "however , we emphasize that properly accounting for the effect of atomic rearrangements inevitably present at surface and interface is crucial .",
    "we further note that lattice distortions appear to be important in stabilizing the observed bulk state , but may be pinned in a heterostructure .",
    "extending our results to include these effects is an important open problem .    in the calculation",
    "reported here the heterostructure is defined only by the difference ( + 3 vs + 2 ) of the la and sr charge .",
    "the calculated electronic charge density is found to be controlled mainly by electrostatic effects ( ionic potentials screened by the electronic charge distribution ) .",
    "results , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_tot ] for @xmath104 , are representative of results obtained for a wide range of on - site interaction @xmath13 .",
    "we find generally that significant leakage of charge into the band insulator region occurs .",
    "the width of the transition region must depend on the relative strength of the @xmath15-direction hoppings and the confining potential .",
    "for the parameters studied here , the transition region is about 3 layers ( so one needs about 7 la layers to obtain a central region with bulk behavior ) , and that the @xmath83 case is special because the la counter - ions sit between the ti planes .",
    "we note , however , that the moderate to large @xmath13-values which we study do ensure that even for thick superlattices the charge density on the central layers never becomes greater than unity .",
    "the calculated width is found to be somewhat less than that found by ohtomo _",
    ", broadening our distribution by the experimental uncertainty ( obtained from the la positions ) leads to calculated width about 2/3 of measured ones . whether the difference arises because we have overestimated the confining potential or for some other reason such as la / sr interdiffusion remains to be determined .",
    "we now turn to our calculated phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "it is expected on general grounds that decreasing the number of la layers will raise the interaction values required for obtaining ordered states .",
    "further , the specific structure of the system of present interest implies an odd - even alternation . both of these features",
    "are indeed observed in our calculation .",
    "our calculation , in combination with the @xmath13-values inferred from optics , suggests that the la / srtio@xmath0 system may be in the interesting ( @xmath161 ) parameter regime in which one or more phase boundaries may be crossed by varying la layer number .",
    "a further point , perhaps especially relevant to systems such as titanates which allow for orbital ordering and orbitally dependent hopping , is that the structural anisotropy intrinsic to the heterostructure may favor different ordering patterns than those found in bulk .",
    "thus we find for the thinnest heterostructures different phases with more translational invariance than found in bulk .",
    "we note , however , that in the ti case the `` edge states '' have a quasi one - dimensional character with an incommensurate filling , perhaps favoring incommensurate charge , spin or orbital ordering at the edge .",
    "the issue of the transport properties of the heterostructure is an important open question , especially in light of the interesting transport data of ref .  .",
    "a crucial experimental finding is that metallic conduction is always observed , consistent with our prediction of conducting edge states .",
    "however , we do not have a qualitative understanding of the hall data , because within the hartee - fock approximation the hall resistivity is obtained by adding up the contributions of the different sub - bands .",
    "the contributions to @xmath162 arising from the quasi one - dimensional @xmath94 sub - bands are controlled by weak deviations from the nearest neighbor hopping approximations , which control the mixing between the two bands and the reconstruction of the fermi surface of the crossing point .",
    "it is difficult to make general statements without more detailed band structure information , but some degree of compensation is expected .",
    "other important issues for future research include study of correlation effects beyond the hartree - fock approximation , inclusion of the coupling between atomic rearrangements , orbital ordering and electronic hopping parameters , and more sophisticated treatment of the dielectric properties of srtio@xmath0 .",
