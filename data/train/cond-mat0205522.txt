    "the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has been a powerful tool for the study of strongly correlated electronic systems .",

    "there are many current attempts to extend the scope of the dmft approach in several directions : to include momentum dependence in the self - energy @xcite , to account for the effects of finite range interactions @xcite , and to combine dmft with realistic band structure @xcite .",
    "+ the current paper is devoted to the investigation of the extended dynamical mean field theory ( e - dmft ) , an extension of the original dmft in order to take into account the spatially non - local interactions beyond the hartree level .",
    "the idea of e - dmft was developed independently in the studies of spin glass @xcite , systems with non - local coulomb interaction @xcite , and the heavy fermion system @xcite . the derivation of e - dmft based on baym - kadanoff functional has been achieved in ref.[@xcite ] . + we present here several methodological developments which build on the e - dmft approach with a view to obtain a more realistic description of solids .",
    "our goals are to describe * a ) * the frequency dependence of the effective interaction and its effects on the single particle spectra , * b ) * the effects of short range correlations , and * c ) * a momentum dependent polarization .",
    "these three effects certainly present in realistic models of solids @xcite .",
    "we discuss them in this paper in the framework of model hamiltonians in sections [ sec-04 ] , [ sec-07 ] , and [ sec-08 ] .",
    "it should be pointed out that the problem is not touched in this paper as how to obtain the parameters of the model hamiltonian from the first principle calculations .",
    "+ in addition we present several technical advances for the analysis of e - dmft equations . in sections [ sec-02 ] and [ sec-03 ] , we present a simplified derivation of these equations in a broken symmetry phase . a method for handling arbitrary interactions within e - dmft - qmc by an interaction shift @xcite",
    "is also discussed in the section .",
    "we show the formalism combining e - dmft with cellular dmft ( c - dmft ) in  [ sec-05 ] and with gw approximation @xcite in  [ sec-06 ] .",
    "+ to illustrate the ideas and the working of the methods we apply them to two problems .",
    "the transitions between a mott insulator ( mi ) , a band insulator ( bi ) , and a fermi liquid ( fl ) in a 3d u - v model is discussed in  [ sec-04 ] .",
    "the model describes an electron system with an on - site repulsion u and a nearest neighbor interaction v. it was treated in simple dmft at half @xcite and quarter @xcite fillings and is relevant to the materials with charge ordered phase @xcite .",
    "the problem of the transition between mi and bi phases in a 1d u - v model with alternating chemical potential was discussed in the context of mixed stack organic compounds @xcite and ferroelectric perovskites @xcite .",
    "we exhibit in  [ sec-07 ] the implementation of e - dmft - gw method on the 1d model . ",
    "[ sec-09 ] is the conclusion .",
    "we start with the following hamiltonian :    @xmath0 @xmath1    the operators @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the pauli matrices for @xmath4  and @xmath5 , the identity .",
    "so the zero - th component of @xmath6 is the charge density and the rest the spin operators .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 represents the chemical potential and the other three , with @xmath4 , the external magnetic field .",
    "+ in eq.([eq-01 ] ) the on - site part of the interaction is isolated in @xmath8 and the off - site parts are described by @xmath9 , hence @xmath10 .",
    "we have allowed all the possible forms of the instantaneous direct and exchange interactions , but excluded some others , like the pair hoppings . unless otherwise specified , the form of the interaction @xmath9 will be generic with only the simple requirements that the interaction be translational invariant , @xmath11 , and symmetric , @xmath12 . due to the possible ionic screening and the super - exchange mechanisms",
    ", we have the freedom to certain extent in choosing @xmath8 and the components of @xmath13 independently at the level of the model hamiltonian .",
    "while it is reasonable to take @xmath14 , in the off - site interaction matrix @xmath13 all possibilities are allowed if some effective forms of the interactions are under consideration . in other words ,",
    "the matrix @xmath13 is not necessarily positive- or negative- definite .",
    "+ in this paper we keep for simplicity @xmath15 and set @xmath16 .",
    "this choice is more general than it appears since we can always choose the direction of the effective magnetic field to be the z - direction by appropriately rotating the system .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the spin symmetry breaking , if it may happen , is also along the z - direction .",
    "this assumption is very natural if @xmath9 is symmetric under the permutation among the three directions .",
    "however , it is actually more restrictive since it requires that if @xmath17 produces any easy - axis , the direction of the easy - axis should be also in the z - direction .",
    "we can then define a spin - dependent chemical potential :    @xmath18    before deriving the e - dmft formalism , we need first to separate out the hartree contributions from the interactions . it is known from the baym - kadanoff functional analysis of e - dmft @xcite that in the phases with broken symmetry , hartree terms contribute to the e - dmft by shifting the chemical potential @xcite . in the current case , due to the spin exchanges , this shift is spin - dependent .",
    "it is also known that in the circumstance of c - dmft @xcite , one needs to handle separately the hartree contributions from the non - local interaction across the cluster boundary . with all these motivations ,",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian as follows :    @xmath19 @xmath20    where the normal ordering of the operators is defined by @xmath21 with the average over the ground state .",
    "the effective chemical potential is defined to be    @xmath22    we work with the functional integral representation of the partition function at finite temperature @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we want to perform a hubbard - stratonovich transform and decouple the @xmath13-interactions @xcite .",
    "since ultimately we will map the many - body system to an impurity model and solve the self - consistent impurity problem via numerical techniques like qmc , it is desired that the hubbard - stratonovich transform be real @xcite . to this end , we need first to add the identity matrices @xmath24 to the off - site interaction to ensure that , for given @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the matrix    @xmath27_{ij}\\stackrel{\\rm def}{= }    \\lambda_{\\alpha\\beta } { \\rm i}_{ij}-[v_{\\alpha\\beta}]_{ij}\\ ] ]    is positive - definite .",
    "the minus sign in front of the bare interaction in the above equation is needed for a real hubbard - stratonovich transform .",
    "practically we can take any value of @xmath28 as long as it is greater than the biggest eigen value of the matrix @xmath29 $ ] whose elements are defined by @xmath29_{ij}\\stackrel{\\rm def}{=}v_{i\\alpha , j\\beta}$ ] . to keep the symmetry",

    "the electron - phonon vertex defined in eq.([eq-06 ] ) is local . in an insulator with a long range coulomb interaction",
    ", one needs a different choice of the vertex , as will be discussed later in  [ sec-08 ] .",
    "+ several remarks are in place . first , since our strategy is to separate out all the hartree contributions from the interactions , we certainly need to treat the auxiliary field in the same way . however , due to the identity    @xmath38_{ij }    \\langle : s_{j\\beta } : \\rangle = 0,\\ ] ]    we need not bother to normal order the @xmath39 fields here .",
    "the current formalism of e - dmft can be extended directly to a general bose field @xcite which can develop non - zero expectation values , if we replace @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "second , there is an arbitrariness in choosing the sign of the electron - phonon vertex which is reflected in the `` @xmath42 '' signs appeared in eq.([eq-06 ] ) .",
    "it comes from the freedom in the ising ( @xmath43 ) symmetry of the order parameters .",
    "for definiteness , we take ` @xmath44 ' from now on .",
    "finally , one can also try to decouple the on - site interaction by using yet another continuous auxiliary field . because this interaction does not get any renormalization as we derive the e - dmft , and because for the local density - density interaction there is the more efficient hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite which uses the discrete ising auxiliary field",
    ", we will not implement this here @xcite .",
    "+ for future reference , we first define the following matsubara green s function :    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    notice that the auxiliary field green s function @xmath48 depends on the value of @xmath35 introduced to make the effective interaction matrix @xmath49 positive definite while the green s functions for the electrons do not .",
    "the auxiliary phonon green s functions are related to the electronic two - particle response functions by the following identity , which can be derived by integrating out the auxiliary degrees of freedom in the phonon green s function ,    @xmath50    with the self - energy given by the dyson equation for the phonons :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 for integer @xmath53 .",
    "the above two equations are in the matrix form in the charge - spin space labeled by @xmath54 .",

    "the equation is in the @xmath59 matrix form labeled by the spin @xmath60 .",
    "+ with the above preparation , we now derive e - dmft .",
    "we will consider two situations . in the next section",
    "we describe the first case , the e - dmft for a homogeneous system in which all the lattice sites are equivalent to each other . in this case",
    "e - dmft approximation amounts to integrating out all but one lattice site to get an effective single site action which is equivalent to a self - consistent impurity model .",
    "all the sites that are integrated out contribute to self - consistent baths of free fermions and bosons for the impurity model . here",
    "we should have a homogeneous chemical potential @xmath61 . in the second case ( see  [ sec-05 ] ) we explore the e - dmft for systems with two mutually penetrating sublattices .",
    "we present a formalism combining e - dmft and c - dmft with a cluster of two neighboring sites .",
    "while it is natural to apply this formalism to a system with two non - equivalent sublattices , it can also be applied to the homogeneous situation . in the latter case ,",
    "the purpose is to treat more accurately the spatial correlations than the single site e - dmft .",
    "this combination of e - dmft and c - dmft can be formulated for clusters of arbitrary size .",
    "we first explore the single site e - dmft applicable to a homogeneous system . by keeping one lattice site",
    "while integrating out the rest using the cavity construction @xcite , we obtain the e - dmft effective action @xcite    @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64    this is an impurity model with both electron and ( auxiliary ) phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the impurity model green s functions are identified with the local green s functions of the lattice model , namely [ see eqs.([eq-07])-([eq-09 ] ) ] ,    @xmath65    the e - dmft self - consistent loop is formed as follows .",
    "one starts with the effective action eq.([eq-13 ] ) and measures the local electron and phonon green s functions as define through eq.([eq-14 ] ) .",
    "then one calculates the self - energies using the local version of the dyson equations :    @xmath66^{-1}(ip_n),\\ ] ]    @xmath67^{-1}(i\\omega_n)\\ ] ]    one of the basic assumptions of dmft is the locality of the self - energy @xcite .",
    "notice that from eq.([eq-10 ] ) the phonon self - energy is different from , although related to , the response functions and the locality of the former does not imply the locality of the latter . under this assumption ,",
    "the same local quantities can be calculated , by using eqs .",

    "this completes the self - consistent loop .",
    "+ it is interesting to notice , however , that one has another choice to form the self - consistent loop through the electronic two particle green s function @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 , as used in refs.[@xcite ] .",
    "it is important that the two different procedures are compatible with each other . by combining eqs.([eq-18 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq-19 ] ) , one can find the following relation in the matrix form :    @xmath75^{-1}(i\\omega_n)=    -{\\cal d}(i\\omega_n)+\\pi^{-1}(i\\omega_n)\\ ] ]    where the local phonon dyson equation ( [ eq-16 ] ) has been used .",
    "this is nothing but the identity one can derive directly from the effective action eq.([eq-13 ] ) and is the local version of the electron - phonon identity , eq.([eq-10 ] ) . hence the two routines , which correspond to making the dmft approximation at the different stages of the formulation , one directly from the non - local electron interaction and the other after the hubbard - stratonovich decomposition , are indeed equivalent , as long as the same interaction vertex defined in eq.([eq-04 ] ) is used .",
    "+ there is , though , still one point left out , that is the arbitrariness of the value of the constants @xmath28 in eq.([eq-04 ] ) .",
    "they were introduced in our formalism for the purpose of ensuring the applicability of the real hubbard - stratonovich transform and are thus unphysical .",
    "while it is obvious that the artificial effects from the @xmath35 dependences cancel out exactly in the original action , eq.([eq-06 ] ) , it is not clear if the same thing happens after the e - dmft approximation . on the other hand , the earlier versions of e - dmft @xcite use only the bare interactions and",
    "have no such a problem .",
    "+ we will show in the following that , even after the e - dmft approximation , the effects from these @xmath35 terms still cancel exactly in _ all _ measurable quantities and only the physical interactions determine the physics .",
    "in doing so , we also establish the equivalence of our e - dmft with the existing ones .",
    "the physical reason behind this perfect cancellation is that the static quartic interactions , including the @xmath35 terms we introduced , do not get any renormalization in dmft , even in the presence of those non - local interactions .",
    "+ to proceed , we need to check the effects on the phonon dynamical weiss functions of the arbitrary @xmath35 dependence we added in eq.([eq-04 ] ) for ensuring the positive - definiteness .",
    "these are easily seen by checking the high frequency behavior of the phonon weiss functions . in this limit",
    ", the phonon self - energy goes to zero at the rate of the inverse frequency square , since it is approximately proportional to the local two particle green s function as shown in eq.([eq-20 ] ) ( remember @xmath72 approaches a finite constant in the same limit ) .",
    "so from eq.([eq-19 ] ) we have :    @xmath76    and thus    @xmath77    we can make a shift of the dynamical phonon weiss functions by defining ( in the matrix form )    @xmath78    the weiss function defined above approaches zero in the high frequency limit .",
    "we then integrate out the auxiliary fields in the effection action eq.([eq-13 ] ) . after rearranging the variables and introducing a new set of the auxiliary field @xmath79 ,",
    "the effective action becomes :    @xmath80 @xmath81    it can be shown that , while the electronic green s functions remain the same , the new local phonon green s function @xmath82 is related to the old one by    @xmath83\\chi^{\\rm loc}(i\\omega_n )     [ \\lambda+{\\cal d}(i\\omega_n ) ]    -{\\cal d}(i\\omega_n)\\chi^{\\rm loc}(i\\omega_n){\\cal d}(i\\omega_n)\\ ] ]    one can also find the relation between the phonon self - energies :    @xmath84    the self - consistent conditions , eqs.([eq-18 ] ) and ( [ eq-19 ] ) , are transformed to    @xmath85^{-1},\\ ] ]    @xmath86^{-1}.\\ ] ]    the self - consistent loop can be formed in the same way as before .",
    "+ so we have shown that the arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath35 does not affect the physical quantities .",
    "this point is best seen through eq.([eq-27 ] ) where a simultaneous shift of @xmath87 and @xmath88 cancels out exactly .",
    "the quantities related to the auxiliary fields , including those described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq-23 ] ) , ( [ eq-25 ] ) , ( [ eq-26 ] ) , and ( [ eq-28 ] ) , do depend on @xmath35 .",
    "but as we pointed out , they are not quantities experimentally measurable . + the formalism shown above , eqs.([eq-24])-([eq-28 ] ) , is equivalent to , although more generic than , those discussed in the existing literatures , due to ( i ) the more general form of the interaction we have taken , ( ii ) the consideration paid to possible broken symmetry , and ( iii ) the introduction of the @xmath35 terms ensuring the positive - definiteness of the interaction matrix .",
    "the method allows us to study the models with general interactions , like the antiferromagnetic spin exchange .",
    "+ before we leave this part , it should be pointed out that the formalism we just developed can readily be applied to the general case containing electron - phonon and long range coulomb interactions .",
    "there is basically only one change needed . due to the dynamics of the real phonons from themselves",
    ", we have an additional term @xmath89 in those related equations , including ( [ eq-10 ] ) , ( [ eq-11 ] ) , ( [ eq-18 ] ) , ( [ eq-19 ] ) , and ( [ eq-28 ] ) .",
    "the electron - phonon identities still hold in the new formalism . without any further change",
    ", the continuous auxiliary boson fields can be used to describe the real phonon fields within the same formalism .",
    "as an example of the practical implementation , in the following we apply the e - dmft formalism based on the continuous auxiliary field approach to a 3d hubbard model with a nearest neighbor density - density repulsion ( the u - v model ) . we will be interested in the case at half - filling .",
    "this is a much simplified version of the model we have investigated in the last section .",
    "especially , there is only one local shift , @xmath90 , needed to make the interaction matrix positive - definite . our purpose is to demonstrate the implementation of e - dmft and investigate the behavior of the density response function in approaching the cdw phase transition . under the given condition ,",
    "this model hamiltonian allows three different phases : the mott insulating phase when @xmath8 is dominant ; the band insulating phase with cdw when @xmath13 prevails ; the metallic fermi liquid phase when the kinetic energy overcomes the interactions . in the mi",
    "phase the system can develop an antiferromagnetic long order if the magnetic frustration is weak enough . for simplicity , in the following we will consider the system at a high enough temperature such that the mi phase is paramagnetic due to the strong thermal fluctuations .",
    "a finite temperature phase diagram at @xmath91 is presented in fig.[fig-01 ] . in the temperature region where our study is performed",
    ", the mott transition is actually a crossover @xcite so the phase diagram in fig.[fig-01 ] should be viewed as a qualitative representation of the actual phase diagram at @xmath92 .",
    "+ the 3d u - v model allows us to illustrate the novel aspects of our methodology , including the implementation of e - dmft with an auxiliary field , carrying out qmc simulation with repulsive interactions , cancellation of the @xmath35 dependence , and investigation of the density - density response .",
    "physically , we have in mind the following questions : ( 1 ) how is the mi - fl transition affected by the non - local interaction @xmath13 ? ( 2 ) how does the charge density instability develop in the e - dmft equations ? ( 3 ) how does a frequency dependent effective interaction affect the quasiparticle properties ?",
    "these questions can not be addressed in the simple dmft studies where the @xmath13 interaction is handled at the hartree level .",
    "+ the following is the 3d model hamiltonian we are going to study :    @xmath93 @xmath94    where @xmath95 represents a pair of nearest - neighboring sites . in this special case ,",

    "the statistical weight from the part of the continuous bosonic fields is obtained directly by computing the corresponding boltzmann factor .",

    "the bandwidth is set to be the energy unit .",
    "we consider paramagnetic solutions at a finite temperature .",
    "since the system is exactly at half - filling , we use in qmc the particle - hole symmetry accompanied by the reversal of the phonon displacement to increase the efficiency of the simulation . in qmc , we take @xmath91 and @xmath97 .",
    "correspondingly the inverse temperature range @xmath98 $ ] is devided into @xmath99 slices",
    ". the typical number of sweeps for qmc measurement is @xmath100 by which all the quantities converge within the statistical errors",
    ". we actually experience critical slowing down in both qmc simulation and the dmft self - consistent iterations as we approach the critical point around @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see fig.[fig-01 ] ) . in this region the typical number of iterations needed for convergence increases from ten to twenty and we use in qmc measurement @xmath103 sweeps .",
    "+ before we present the results , we want to show that at the numerical level , the @xmath35 depending term does not affect the physical results .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that in the formulation of e - dmft the @xmath35 dependence does not show up in physical quantities .",
    "however it can happen that if the formalism is so sensitive to the dependence such that in a practical calculation like qmc there is always only partial cancellation and a significant @xmath35 dependence remains in the physical measurables .",
    "it is also possible that a negligible @xmath35 dependence in the results of the impurity model , which is always there unless one can solve the problem exactly , may get magnified during the e - dmft iterations . in the following",
    "we present the results calculated at @xmath101 and @xmath102 which show no @xmath35 dependence . from the phase diagram fig.[fig-01 ] one can see that this is the point we have reached closest in the parameter space to the finite temperature critical point ( cp ) .",
    "if the suggested scenarios of the @xmath35 dependence in the physical results may happen , they most likely happen around the cp where the system becomes very sensitive to the extra change from @xmath35 . in fig.[fig-02 ] we plot the imaginary part of the electron green s functions calculated at four different @xmath35 s .",
    "the result shows no @xmath35 dependence within the accuracy of the calculation @xcite .",
    "similar for the electron density green s functions as shown in fig.[fig-03 ] .",
    "so in both the formulation and the practical calculation , the @xmath35 term does not play any physical role and we can use it safely .",
    "in all the following calculation , we set @xmath104 in the qmc simulation .",
    "+      we first present the result showing the crossover between the mi and fl phases . in fig.[fig-04",
    "] we show the data of @xmath105 v.s .",
    "@xmath8 at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the reason we choose to plot this function is that it is known @xcite that the asymptotic behavior at the low frequency limit of the imaginary part of the electron green s function reflects the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi surface . for the metallic phase",
    "the dos is finite at the fermi surface and hence @xmath108 . for the insulating phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding dos is zero and @xmath109 .",
    "so from the plotting of @xmath110 at the first fermionic matsubara frequency we can study the transition or crossover behavior between the two phases . since we solve the problem at a temperature ( @xmath91 ) higher than the critical temperature ( @xmath111 , see ref.[@xcite ] ) of the mott transition , what we see in fig.[fig-04 ] is that for fixed @xmath13 , @xmath112 decreases smoothly as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "this behavior represents the crossover between the two phase .",
    "there is a small but finite shift in between the two curves calculated at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is a result of the competition between @xmath8 and @xmath13 . in the case of @xmath113",
    "the system enters the bi phase for @xmath114 which one can see approximately from fig.[fig-01 ] .",
    "this region is out of the scope of the current approach applicable only to a homogeneous system . in the range @xmath115 , which is , roughly speaking , the crossover region , the value of @xmath105 at the same @xmath8 is always bigger for @xmath113 than that for @xmath106 .",
    "this means that the existence of the finite @xmath13 makes the system more metallic and so the effective @xmath8 is smaller , as one anticipates from qualitative considerations . if @xmath8 is increased further so that @xmath116 , both the systems enter the paramagnetic insulating phase with literally no difference .",
    "+ we then investigate the behavior of the various green s functions as the transition towards the band insulating phase is approached by changing @xmath13 at fixed @xmath8 .",
    "we first show the results at @xmath101 .",
    "we solve the problem for seven different values of the interaction : @xmath117 , @xmath107 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . in all the results presented below the data from the last case",
    "are not shown because we already encounter the instability at which the convergence of the self - consistent interaction is lost .",
    "so we can view @xmath123 as an upper boundary of the metallic phase for @xmath101 . in fig.[fig-05 ] we show the imaginary part of the electron green s function and in fig.[fig-06 ] the imaginary part of the electron self - energy .",
    "it can be seen clearly that , while the trends of the change of the plotted quantities are in the direction towards a more metallic phase as @xmath13 is increased ( that is , bigger @xmath124 and smaller self - energy at the first several matsubara frequencies ) , the magnitudes of the changes are very limited , especially in comparison with the phonon green s functions @xcite shown in fig.[fig-07 ] .",
    "the local phonon green s function , which is related to the density susceptibility as we have shown in the last section , increases significantly as we approach the phase transition point .",
    "we can analyze the behavior from the self - consistent equation ( [ eq-19 ] ) , which can be rewritten as    @xmath125    as a result of screening the phonon self - energy is negative .",
    "moreover , @xmath126 is a monotonically decreasing function of the frequency , since the screening becomes less effective as the frequency increases .",
    "hence the instability , if it may happen , will first show up at the wave vector @xmath127 and the frequency @xmath128 , where the product @xmath129 has the biggest positive value .",
    "in fig.[fig-08 ] we show the plotting of @xmath130 v.s .",
    "@xmath13 at the given @xmath8 .",
    "the trend is obvious for the product to approach `` @xmath131 '' where the corresponding denominator in eq.([eq-31 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this establishes the picture that as the transition point is approached , the denominator disappears first at @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which corresponds to an instability against the homogeneous ground state with a static cdw at wave vector @xmath134 .",
    "this is a typical phenomenon in the green s function description of phase transitions @xcite , although the quantities involved here are non - perturbative .",
    "the instability is signaled by a frequency of phonon becoming negative @xcite . at this point",
    "an ordered mean field state would be the correct solution .",
    "it should be noted that , even when the instability happens , one may still continue the paramagnetic solution of e - dmft by taking the principle part in eq.([eq-31 ] ) .",
    "but in 3d the convergence near transition is impossible because the derivative of the phonon green s function with respect to the control parameter @xmath13 becomes infinite .",
    "+      another interesting property to investigate is the effective on - site density - density interaction , which is defined at @xmath135    @xmath136    and is frequency dependent . from fig.[fig-09 ] we can see clearly that as the transition is approached , there is a tendency of the softening of the effective interaction at the zero frequency . in our model",
    "the frequency dependence of the local @xmath137 is due to screening of the bare interaction by the _ intersite _",
    "coulomb interaction @xmath13 .",
    "notice however that a frequency dependent @xmath8 occurs more generally in realistic models of correlated electron due to _ intrasite _ screening by other local orbitals as a recent local gw calculation @xcite shows .",
    "this is the first e - dmft study of a model where the interaction @xmath8 is frequency dependent .",
    "we should stress that this behavior of the single particle green s function can not be described by an ordinary dmft with fixed @xmath8 . in fig.[fig-10 ] we show how the frequency depending effective @xmath8 changes the single electron behavior .",
    "we plot in fig.[fig-10 ] the imaginary part of the electron self - energy as a function of the matsubara frequency . at high frequencies , the self - energy from e - dmft coincides with that calculated using the bare @xmath8 alone .",
    "this tells that the screening effect is not effective in the high frequency limit , same as we can see from the effective @xmath8 plotted in fig.[fig-09 ] . in the low frequencies ,",
    "the self - energy deviates to that of a smaller effective @xmath8 . in fig.[fig-10 ] we plotted the self - energies calculated at @xmath138 and @xmath139 evaluated at the lowest and the next lowest matsubara frequencies .",
    "we can see that at the first matsubara frequency the e - dmft self - energy is closest to that given by @xmath140 and @xmath138 .",
    "we can understand the situation by thinking that there are two different @xmath8 s controlling low and high frequency regions separately .",
    "some effective and screened @xmath8 is in charge of the low frequency behavior while the bare @xmath8 works in the high frequency region . in between",
    "there is a kind of the crossover connecting the two .",
    "the results shown here suggests that a frequency independent effective @xmath8 is not enough to capture the physics in the entire frequency range .",
    "+ the set of diagrams presented above are plotted very close to the line of the mott crossover ( see fig.[fig-01 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we show two other sets of data which are plotted in the metallic and the mott insulator phases , respectively .",
    "+      first , we show the results at @xmath141 and increasing @xmath13 in figs.[fig-11]-[fig-13 ] . as can be seen from fig.[fig-01 ] , at this set of parameters the system is in the correlated metallic phase .",
    "to be concise , we show here three representative plottings , that is the electron and phonon green s functions and the electron self - energy .",
    "one can see that in this phase the change of the single electron green s function is very limited as the transition is approached at @xmath142",
    ". meanwhile , the single electron self - energy changes quite a lot in the low frequency region , showing the stronger cancellation between the effects from @xmath8 and @xmath13 and thus the more significant reduction of the self - energy as @xmath13 is increased .",
    "the change of the phonon green s function is again much bigger than those of the electrons .",
    "+      the second case with @xmath143 is shown in figs.[fig-14]-[fig-16 ] .",
    "here we work in the mott insulating phase .",
    "one can see from the asymptotic behavior of the green s functions in the low frequency limit that in entire the range , especially near the transition at @xmath144 , the system is still in the mott insulating phase . meanwhile",
    ", the corresponding phonon green s functions plotted in fig.[fig-16 ] change a lot .",
    "+      finally , by literally sweeping across the u - v space , we are able to establish the finite temperature phase diagram presented in fig.[fig-01 ] .",
    "the phase transition from the metallic and the mi phases to the bi phase is determined unambiguously from the breaking down of the convergence of the e - dmft iterations .",
    "we locate the crossover line between the fl and mi phases by search the points of ( u , v ) at which @xmath145 . while its specific value is arguable , this criterion works well practically in the sense that right around the cp it suggests , @xmath146 , we experienced the strongest critical slowing down . +",
    "two remarks are in place concerning the qualitative features contained in this finite temperature phase diagram .",
    "first , the slopes of the boundaries of the fl phase are positive on both sides .",
    "this actually reflects the competition between @xmath8 and @xmath13 : the existence of a finite and small @xmath13 requires a bigger @xmath8 in order to make the mott transition or crossover .",
    "similarly a finite and small @xmath8 makes it harder to develop the cdw .",
    "second , the effects of a finite @xmath13 is much stronger than that of @xmath8 , because of the coordination number , which is six in the current case .",
    "the above features will retain in the phase diagram at @xmath92 .",
    "next we consider e - dmft on systems with two interpenetrating sublattices .",
    "the current study is useful in the situation when the two sublattices are not equivalent in the sense that , while it is homogeneous within each of them , the order parameter is different in the two sublattices .",
    "one then needs in e - dmft a cluster containing at least two neighboring sites .",
    "it is interesting , though , to notice that the formalism we are going to develop also applies to the homogeneous systems . in this case",
    "the cluster plays the role to improve the description of the spatial correlations .",
    "the formalism described in this section can be easily extended to problems where clusters of bigger sizes are needed .",
    "e - dmft was combined with dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) in ref.[@xcite ] .",
    "+ under the given conditions , the nearest neighbor hoppings and interactions alway connect the two different sublattices , the next nearest neighbor ones are within the same sublattice , _",
    "etc_. we rely on the external magnetic fields introduced at the beginning , eq.([eq-01 ] ) , to lift any possible degeneracy in the ground state . to illustrate the basic idea while avoid any unnecessary repetition ( as it will turn out , the e - dmft with two sublattices shares many properties with that for the homogeneous system ) , we work on a model with only nearest neighbor hoppings and density - density interactions , besides the on - site energy ( the chemical potential ) and the hubbard interaction .",

    "especially , the phonon green s function plays the role as the screened coulomb interaction which in the original gw is obtained by using rpa .",

    "the phase factors @xmath225 come from the fact that each site ( a , i ) [ ( b , i ) ] has two neighbors , one within the same unit cell , ( b , i ) [ ( a , i ) ] and the other comes from the cell to the left ( right ) , ( b , i-1 ) [ ( a , i+1 ) ] . hence the later contributes a momentum dependent phase factor .",
    "remember when we use the above two equations for self - consistency in e - dmft , the off - diagonal self - energies for both electrons and phonons should be set to zero due the assumption of locality :    @xmath226    because of the dimensionality , the momentum summations needed in calculating the local green s functions can be carried out exactly , which give :    @xmath227    with    @xmath228    and    @xmath229 @xmath230}\\ ] ]    in the above , we used again the notation that @xmath231b if x@xmath232a and vice versa . as we have noted , the solution of the impurity model in the current case consists of two independent parts , one for each representative lattice site , and each of them are exactly the same as that for a homogeneous system .",
    "the only difference comes in at the self - consistent conditions which are given by the above pair of equations .",

    "to illustrate the idea and see qualitatively how the gw self - energy can improve the results , we consider here the simplest and the most important gw contributions , those from the nearest neighbors .",
    "they contribute directly to the off - diagonal self - energies , while for the diagonal ones , we use those from the e - dmft calculation .",
    "all the other contributions are neglected because the green s functions decay exponentially as the spatial separation increases in the band insulating phase .",

    "\\end{array }    \\right]\\ ] ]    the momentum dependences of the off - diagonal terms in the above two equations come in for the same reason as those in the free electron and phonon propagators . in the current situation both the gw terms we discussed in the previous section contribute as given by eqs.([eq-48 ] ) and ( [ eq-49 ] ) . to make life easier",
    ", we make a further approximation which replaces the full interaction vertices by their bare values :    @xmath235    @xmath236    then eqs.([eq-48 ] ) and ( [ eq-49 ] ) are greatly simplified and give :    @xmath237    @xmath238    in reaching the numerical results we are going to present , we use @xmath104 for the positive - definiteness of the effective interaction matrix . in every iteration , the impurity model is solved via qmc by @xmath100 sweeps . to reach the e - dmft convergence ,",
    "ten iterations are usually needed .",

    "the exact result and the hartree mean field ( mf ) result are also plotted as references . from the results",
    ", one can see that the two terms in the gw correction are of the same order .",
    "+ in fig.[fig-21 ] we show the results of the imaginary part of the local electron green s function from gw calculation after e - dmft convergence and those using gw within the e - dmft iteration loop .",
    "one can see that the difference is very small .",
    "the corresponding real part is plotted in fig.[fig-22 ] . in fig.[fig-23 ] we show the plotting of the green s function between a pair of neighboring sites .",
    "we can also compare the result on the average energy per site @xmath244 .",
    "the result of gw after e - dmft gives @xmath245 and that for gw within e - dmft @xmath246 .",
    "the dmrg finds the exact average ground state energy per site to be @xmath247 .",
    "the difference between the two gw+dmft procedures is again very minor . from the given results and those performed at the other parameter points which are not shown here , we conclude that the two procedures , one with gw after e - dmft and the other with gw in e - dmft iteration , give very close results , although it seems",
    "the former is a little better .",
    "+ the physical information contained in figs.[fig-20]-[fig-23 ] can be understood as follows .",
    "( i ) in one dimension , all the allowed modes of the low energy excitations are those bosonic particle hole pairs carrying momentum @xmath248 and @xmath249 ( @xmath250 at half - filling ) with respect to the hartree ground state .",
    "this explains why a c - dmft calculation with a cluster of only two sites gives quite good results @xcite while the e - dmft we employed here does not work very well at low frequencies .",
    "the difference is basically that a model of a single site can only capture those modes @xmath248 ; but a cluster of two sites is already good enough for those at @xmath251 . (",
    "ii ) since the classical hartree energy gap , which is given by @xmath252 is quite small in this case and both the interactions in eq.([eq-51 ] ) are ( marginally ) relevant with respect to the metallic gaussian fixed point , as we go to lower energy scales and thus longer wave lengths , the energy gap gets renormalized significantly .",
    "this explains why the exact dmrg result is so different from the mf result at low frequencies . the high frequency behavior , on the other hand , can be captured fairly well even by the hartree approximation , which is evident from figs.[fig-20]-[fig-23 ] .",
    "this is the region where all the different approaches converge to give the same result .",
    "( iii ) from the figures of the local electron green s function one can see that at not too low frequencies ( basically , those beyond the first two matsubara frequencies ) , the e - dmft result is much better than the mf result and closer to the exact ones .",
    "this is consistent with the scaling picture since the contributions to the results at those frequencies higher than the gap energy , which is of the order of  @xmath131 \" in the current case , can only be from the local behavior and are described fairly well by the e - dmft . on the other hand",
    ", this same reason explains the big deviation of the e - dmft result at the first two matsubara frequencies : they are affected more strongly by those quantum / thermal fluctuations with longer wave length , which are mostly neglected by the e - dmft approximation .",
    "( iv ) the gw works in the way we have anticipated .",
    "it incorporates more spatial correlations into the self - energy so that the low frequency behavior benefits a lot from the correction . as we can see from figs.[fig-21 ] and",
    "[ fig-22 ] the gw contributes to both the real and imaginary parts of the local green s functions corrections of more than @xmath253 .",
    "( v ) the gw method used here has little effect on the nearest neighbor green s functions because it is designed to improve the local green s functions .",
    "+ what we have shown above is that the gw method can be used to improve the e - dmft results . due to the dimensionality ,",
    "the single - site e - dmft results deviates from the exact ones at the lowest frequencies . by incorporating the spatial correlations",
    ", the gw perturbation contributes a desired correction .",
    "of course in this very case in 1d it is known that the spatial correlation is so important that a leading order perturbation is not enough to recover the exact results .",
    "what is important is that the above example shows the gw method works in the way as we anticipated .",
    "our major objective is to apply gw - dmft to strongly correlated electronic systems in higher dimensions .",
    "we know e - dmft works much better as is evident from the scaling behavior with respect to the dimension .",
    "we also know that the leading order perturbation in terms of the interaction vertex , the gw , works better .",
    "we thus have a method which is much easier to handle technically than c - dmft and is able to achieve the same goal to certain extent .",
    "e - dmft allows to describe the interactions in a more flexible way than we have presented so far .",
    "the need for such a freedom is evident in the realistic calculation of materials , where , instead of the nearest neighbor repulsion considered in this paper we have to treat the coulomb interaction and its multipole expansion .",
    "for such a system , the dielectric function is given by , in the linear response theory @xcite :    @xmath254    where @xmath255 is the coulomb interaction given by , in 3d    @xmath256    and @xmath257 is the density - density green s function defined through eq.([eq-08 ] ) .",
    "one can make use of the electron - phonon identity , eq.([eq-10 ] ) ( set @xmath135 ) and get :    @xmath258    here the phonon self - energy @xmath259 can be understood as the collection of all the electron polarization diagrams . if one proceeds with the formalism we presented in the previous sections , the phonon self - energy @xmath259 within e - dmft approximation is assumed to be momentum independent .",
    "however , eq.([eq-65 ] ) is not the correct functional form for an insulator in which the polarization should be given by @xmath260 with @xmath261 weakly @xmath132 dependent .",
    "+ to handle this situation in e - dmft we have to tailor the formalism to be compatible with the functional form of the response function .",
    "this leads us to the following generalization of the action discussed in sections [ sec-02 ] and [ sec-03 ] :    @xmath262\\ ] ]    where we have defined a generalized electron density :    @xmath263    with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the spin labels .",
    "the indices @xmath264 and @xmath265 are used to label the local degrees of freedom other than the spin , like the components of the multipole moments .",
    "@xmath266 is the free action plus the local interaction .",
    "the key part here is the electron - phonon vertex @xmath267 which is momentum dependent . a wise choice of this vertex allows to preserve the physical momentum dependence in the response function after the e - dmft approximation .",
    "+ we can define the following green s function in the matrix form :    @xmath268_{ab}=-\\langle { \\rm t}_{\\tau }    \\phi_a ( q,\\tau ) \\phi_b ( -q,0 ) \\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath269_{ab}= -\\langle { \\rm t}_{\\tau }     \\rho_a(q,\\tau)\\rho_b(-q,0)\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath270    with    @xmath271    same as before , we can derive an electron - phonon identity :    @xmath272^{-1}=-d_0(q )    + \\pi^{-1}(q , i\\omega_n),\\ ] ]    so far the results are exact .",
    "the e - dmft approximation amounts to mapping the general model ( [ eq-66 ] ) to an impurity problem by integrating out all but one lattices site ( we consider the homogeneous phase here ) .",
    "the only new feature is that the general electron - phonon interaction vertex is not necessarily local as we had before .",
    "the resulting phonon self - energy is a function of frequency only .",
    "the general density - density green s function @xmath273 , a physical quantity , now contains a non - trivial momentum dependence which is evident from eqs.([eq-68 ] ) and ( [ eq-69 ] ) . since the electron - phonon vertex @xmath274",
    "can alway be adjusted by redefining the auxiliary phonons , we are able to obtain the desired momentum dependence from the physical considerations . + to see how it works , we go back to the example of the insulator .",
    "we need the following form of the electron - phonon coupling in order to describe the dipole - dipole interaction :    @xmath275    with @xmath276 .",
    "meanwhile the free phonon propagator is of the form    @xmath277    in order that the coulomb interaction be recovered when the auxiliary phonons are integrated out . under this interaction vertex",
    ", the auxiliary phonon represents an electric field mediating the dipole - dipole interaction . since only the longitudinal field",
    "is coupled to the dipole moment , we can keep the corresponding phonon mode and discard the transversal ones . for the e - dmft approximation",
    ", it is desired to work in the coordinate space where the cavity construction is possible . to this end",
    "one needs to convert the electron - phonon coupling to real space which can be done by using the wannier functions .",
    "+ after solving the e - dmft problem , the electron density green s function is given by    @xmath278    and the dielectric function becomes    @xmath279    which has the correct form for an insulator .",
    "+ to conclude , we have introduced in this section a way to tailor the e - dmft formalism so that the desired momentum dependence can be preserved from physical considerations .",
    "in the paper we suggested a simple procedure of deriving e - dmft formalism , that is first separating out the hartree contributions and then making the e - dmft approximation with regard to the fluctuations around the hartree ground state .",
    "this procedure is essential in the phase with broken symmetry .",
    "it also helps to formulate the c - dmft .",
    "+ we developed an e - dmft formulation by using a real hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "we introduced a local shift to the general non - local interaction to ensure the positive - definiteness of the effective interaction matrix .",
    "our investigation showed that in all the physical quantities the effects from the arbitrary shift canceled out exactly .",
    "we also proved the equivalence of forming the e - dmft self - consistency by using the auxiliary phonon green s function and the two - electron green s function . based on these ideas , we derived an e - dmft of a single impurity site for a homogeneous system with generic two particle interactions .",
    "we also presented a formalism of e - dmft combined with c - dmft for a cluster of two lattice sites , which is generalizable to clusters containing any number of sites .",
    "+ we suggested a generalized gw approach to incorporate the spatial correlations into the e - dmft approximation . while the on - site self - energies are obtained non - perturbatively through e - dmft , those relatively weaker off - site contributions can be calculated in a perturbative way .",
    "we identified the most important contributions to the non - local self - energies .",
    "+ we showed how e - dmft could be tailored to handle the response functions with non - trivial momentum dependence in an insulator . through the example of the dielectric function we exhibited that an appropriately defined electron - phonon vertex was able to keep the correct functional form of the response function .",
    "+ we implemented a qmc algorithm with shifts in e - dmft to handle the non - positive - definite interactions .",
    "this algorithm can be used for a large variety of problems , including the anderson lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "two examples of the implementations were presented .",
    "+ the first example was the application of the single site e - dmft to the 3d u - v model .",
    "we studied the behavior of the electron green s function and the response function as the density instability was approached .",
    "we studied the crossover between the metallic and the mott insulating phases .",
    "we investigated the frequency dependence of the effective on - site interaction and showed its impact on the single electron behavior .",
    "we showed a finite temperature phase diagram of the 3d u - v model .",
    "+ in the second example , we applied a single site e - dmft combined with gw method to a 1d u - v model with an alternating chemical potential .",
    "it was found that the gw approach improved the e - dmft results at low frequencies in the desired direction .",
    "we also found that in the case under investigation , it made little difference whether or not the gw perturbation was performed within the e - dmft iteration .",
    "+ the success of the e - dmft implementation opens the door to tackle many complicated physical problems which could not be handled by simple dmft or other methods . the combination with gw and/or c - dmft points out a systematic way to improve the ( e- ) dmft method .",
