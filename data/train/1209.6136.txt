    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures ( @xmath1 ) and/or chemical potentials ( @xmath0 ) , strongly interacting matter goes through a phase transition from colour insulating hadron gas ( hg ) phase to colour conducting quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase  @xcite .",
    "this is known as the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "polyakov loop which is related to the free energy of quark is known as the order parameter of this deconfining phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the other important property of qcd is spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this feature of chiral symmetry gives rise to a second type of phase transition known as chiral symmetry restoration phase transition at high temperature and/or density  @xcite .",
    "chiral condensate is a suitable order parameter to determine this kind of phase transition occur in qcd matter .",
    "heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to study this qcd phase transition from hg to qgp  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable outcome of these experiments is the observation of a hot , strongly interacting matter which behaves much like a nearly perfect relativistic fluid  @xcite .",
    "our endeavour in such studies is the search of a suitable equation of state ( eos ) for the description of both phases of strongly interacting matter .",
    "significant success has been gained in lattice calculations using qcd thermodynamics to provide a valid eos for qcd matter at zero baryon chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "however , the lattice methods still lack a reliability to describe the properties of matter possessing a finite density of baryons .",
    "therefore , finding an eos for qcd matter valid at zero as well as non - zero chemical potential is still a challenging problem .",
    "consequently , in the absence of a proper and realistic eos for qcd matter , precise mapping of the entire qcd phase boundary and finding the location of a hypothesized qcd critical point ( cp ) appears as a tough challenge before the experimentalists and theorists  @xcite .",
    "recently , we constructed a hybrid model for hg and qgp phases where we made use of a new excluded volume model for hg and a thermodynamically consistent quasiparticle model for the qgp phase  @xcite .",
    "we have compared various thermodynamical and transport properties at @xmath2 as obtained in our hybrid model description with the recent lattice results and found an excellent agreement between them  @xcite .",
    "we have also constructed a deconfining first order phase boundary between hg and qgp and found an end point where the boundary terminates  @xcite .",
    "further , we have shown that at this end point , the nature of phase transition changes as @xmath3 and @xmath4 become zero where @xmath5 is the entropy density and @xmath6 is the square of speed of sound  @xcite .",
    "we have also found a cusp like behaviour in the variation of @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the shear viscosity ) with respect to temperature at the end point obtained in our hybrid model  @xcite which was , therefore , suggested as a hint for the existence of qcd cp by some authors  @xcite earlier .",
    "all these results suggest that this end point could be taken as a cp of deconfinement phase transition from hg to qgp .",
    "the physical mechanism involved in this calculation is intuitively analogous to the percolation model where a first order phase transition results due to jamming of baryons which thus restricts the mobility of baryons  @xcite .",
    "however , in the percolation model we do not have any comparison to what we should get in the qgp picture . here",
    "we use a similar picture and we explicitly and separately consider both the phases , i.e. , hg as well as qgp and hence it gives a clear understanding how a first - order deconfining phase transition can be constructed in nature and finally we reach to an interesting finding that the baryonic size is crucially responsible for the existence of cp on the phase boundary in such a construction . at low baryon density , overlapping mesons fuse into each other and form a large bag or cluster , whereas at high baryon density , hard - core repulsion among baryons , restricts the mobility of baryons .",
    "consequently we consider two distinct limiting regimes of hg , one beyond cp is a meson - dominant regime and the other is a baryon dominant region .    in this paper , we want to explore further the suitability of the hybrid model in predicting the properties of qcd matter having a finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "as we have pointed out that a hot , strongly coupled and nearly perfect fluid was observed at rhic where the viscosity is small enough , @xmath9  @xcite , thus ideal fluid description can indeed be appropriate to explain the expansion history of the matter created during the heavy ion collisions  @xcite at least at rhic and lhc .",
    "ideal relativistic hydrodynamics is entropy conserving i.e. , the ratio of the entropy and the particle number is expected to remain constant during expansion of the medium in heavy ion collision .",
    "the eos of strongly interacting matter should indicate such hydrodynamic description of the medium .",
    "very recently wuppartel - budapest ( wb ) collaboration gave the isentropic trajectories on the @xmath10 plane and calculated various thermodynamical as well as transport properties along these trajectories  @xcite .",
    "this lattice calculation involves taylor s expansion method to circumvent the fermion sign problem which always exists at finite @xmath0 . in the same paper  @xcite",
    ", authors have also shown the results for various thermodynamic quantities at @xmath11 mev ( where @xmath12 while strangeness chemical potential @xmath13 has been calculated by imposing the net strangeness neutrality condition i.e. @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be worthwhile to compare the results obtained by the collaboration with the corresponding results of our hybrid model and thus its suitability for the description of qcd matter can be tested .",
    "we must emphasize the new results obtained by us in order to demonstrate the importance of the present paper .",
    "the utility of our hybrid model essentially at finite @xmath0 can be well tested with the recent lattice results  @xcite so that the model is regarded to provide the most valid description for the eos of qgp in the entire @xmath10 region .",
    "we first draw the isentropic trajectories at some fixed @xmath15 ( which is equivalent to fixed @xmath16 trajectories of ref  @xcite since in our model we include the condition of net strangeness neutrality ) on @xmath10 plane .",
    "we plot the isentropic trajectories having @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 correspond to typical ratios at rhic , sps and ags , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we also show the the location of cp on first order deconfining phase boundary as obtained earlier in our hybrid model  @xcite together with the chemical freezeout curve as obtained in our model of hg  @xcite on this @xmath10 plane to demonstrate its proximity to cp .",
    "we then calculate various thermodynamic as well as transport quantities like normalized pressure density ( @xmath20 ) , normalized energy density ( @xmath21 ) , normalized entropy density ( @xmath22 ) , trace anomaly ( @xmath23 ) and square of the speed of sound ( @xmath6 ) and plot their variations with temperature along isentropic trajectory having @xmath24 which corresponds to the highest rhic energy i.e. , @xmath25 gev .",
    "we compare our model results with the corresponding results obtained in recent lattice calculation  @xcite .",
    "we also calculate @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for strongly interacting matter at @xmath26 mev and show their variations with respect to temperature in the present hybrid model description which is again compared with lattice data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec . 2 and 3",
    ", we will provide a brief description of our hg model and thermodynamically consistent quasiparticle model of qgp , respectively .",
    "detailed description of these models can be found in our previous work  @xcite . sec .",
    "4 will demonstrate all the results obtained by us in our hybrid model and their comparison with the lattice results .",
    "in the excluded volume models , repulsive interaction between two baryons has been included by giving the baryons a hard - core geometrical size and consequently reduces the hadronic degrees of freedom at large @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the hadronic pressure is reduced and one can get a deconfinement phase transition from hg to qgp by using gibbs construction . we incorporate excluded - volume correction arising due to baryonic size only in our excluded volume model .",
    "we assume that mesons can overlap and fuse into one another and hence do not possess any hard - core repulsion . the grand canonical partition function for the baryons in hg , with full quantum statistics and after incorporating excluded volume correction can be explicitly written as  @xcite : @xmath27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the degeneracy factor of ith species of baryons , @xmath29 is the energy of the particle ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 is the eigenvolume of one baryon of ith species and @xmath32 is the total occupied volume by the baryons and @xmath33 represents total number of baryons of jth species .",

( 9 ) , the first term on the right hand side represents the pressure due to all types of baryons and the second term gives the total pressure from all mesons in hg .",
    "we use ideal gas description to calculate the mesonic pressure  @xcite . in this calculation",
    ", we have taken an equal volume @xmath53 for each baryon with a hard - core radius @xmath54 fm .",
    "the reason to choose this hard - core radius has been discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have taken all baryons and mesons and their resonances having masses upto @xmath55 in our calculation of hg pressure .",
    "we have also used the condition of strangeness neutrality by putting @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the strangeness quantum number of the ith hadron , and @xmath58 is the strange ( anti - strange ) hadron density of ith species , respectively .",

    "now , by using the thermodynamic relation @xmath75 , pressure of system at @xmath76 can be obtained as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the pressure at a reference temperature @xmath79 .",

    "the end point of this phase boundary is shown by solid diamond symbol .",
    "we have shown earlier that the phase transition changes its nature from first order to higher order  @xcite at this end point and thus it represents a cp of deconfinement phase transition between hg and qgp phases .",

    "we also observe that in our hybrid model result , there is no sign of any discontinuity at the joining point of hg and qgp phases in the variations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to temperatures .",
    "it is due to the passing of this constant @xmath15 trajectory from hg to qgp phase in crossover region as shown in fig .",

    "trace anomaly slowly decreases with the increase in temperature , however , it remains significant even upto @xmath104 mev .",

    "we observe a shallow minimum in @xmath6 around @xmath105 mev which corresponds to a smooth crossover from hg to qgp phase or vice - versa as suggested in refs .",
    "all the results at constant @xmath100 suggest that the medium goes through a smooth crossover from hg to qgp at the highest rhic energy i.e. , @xmath101 gev around @xmath106 mev and the strength of the interaction is still quite significant .",
    "now , we want to calculate some thermodynamical quantities at a large value of @xmath0 ( @xmath107 mev ) and make comparisons with the corresponding results obtained in lattice calculation  @xcite .",
    "however , before making this exercise it is very important to note that for a large value of @xmath0 , we need other lattice calculations separately in order to support the trends given here as the notorious sign problem creeping into lattice calculation and make it difficult at net baryon density ( or baryon chemical potential ) .",
    "moreover , the lattice eos used here is primarily based on using taylor expansion , and by construction it can not reveal either a critical endpoint or first order phase transition . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , we have presented the variations of the normalized pressure density with respect to temperature at @xmath26 mev .",

    "we find a good agreement at higher temperatures in contradiction to the normalized pressure density case ( see fig .  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "also one noticeable thing is that we found a discontinuity at the joining point of hg and qgp phase in variation of @xmath21 .",

    "we find that at low as well as high temperatures our model results agree well with the lattice results .",
    "however , at intermediate temperature range i.e. , from 160 mev to 300 mev , we find that our model results exceed over lattice results .",
    "we have also observed a discontinuity in our hybrid model results which clearly shows a first order phase transition at @xmath108 mev for @xmath26 mev in contradiction to lattice results which still shows a crossover type of behaviour at @xmath26 mev .    in conclusion ,",
