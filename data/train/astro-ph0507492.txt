    "the resolution had to be increased to approximately 50 grid zones per hill radius before a numerically converged solution for the migration rate was attained .",
    "lower resolutions yielded artificially rapid migration .",
    "@xcite conclude from this that although torques from the near - planet region are significant , they do not appear to dramatically increase the migration rate .",

    "stochastic migration might deplete low mass planetary embryos that would be relatively immune to ordinary type  i migration , while simultaneously promoting radial mixing and collision of planetesimals . for giant planet formation , a significant random component to core migration would have the effect of creating large fluctuations in the planetesimal accretion rate , while also potentially acting to diffuse the planetesimal surface density .",
