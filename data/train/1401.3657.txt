    "for a long time , discussion of the role of black holes in globular clusters has been dominated by the theme of intermediate - mass black holes . while no - one would doubt that stellar - mass black holes once existed in these objects , one reason for their neglect is a long - standing theoretical prediction @xcite that there should be virtually none at the present day .",
    "as we shall see , this view is in need of revision , but in the meantime interest in the population of stellar - mass black holes in globular clusters was sustained by two ideas .",
    "the first is the realisation that they may be a prolific source of black - hole binaries and thus of sources of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the second is the role that stellar - mass black holes play in the evolution of cluster cores @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the black hole population itself , and , in particular , how many are to be expected at the present day in one particular old globular cluster .",
    "thanks to software advances over many years , it is now quite straightforward to perform simulations of star clusters and to study the evolution of the black hole population directly . what is still hard , however , is to do this with models which resemble globular star clusters .",
    "the most sophisticated direct @xmath0-body techniques have been applied to this problem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and several previous references by other authors ) , but the restriction to systems which initially possessed only of order @xmath1 stars vitiates their direct application to all except the least populous globular clusters .",
    "there are two solutions , one being to _ scale _ the results of @xmath0-body models , provided that this can be done in a way which preserves the time - scales of the main evolutionary processes at work ; the paper by @xcite is an example , very relevant to the scientific aims of the present paper , and we return to it in our discussion ( sec.[sec : bh - and - evolution ] ) .",
    "the second solution is the use of monte carlo codes , which are not restricted to small values of @xmath0 , though they are less free of assumptions and approximations , and require cross - validation with @xmath0-body results in the range of @xmath0 where the two techniques overlap @xcite .",
    "a monte carlo code is the main tool adopted in the present paper , but an independent code has also been applied to a similar problem by @xcite .",
    "even with a monte carlo code , however , different sets of initial conditions will give different answers for the number of stellar - mass black holes expected to survive to the present day .",
    "in previous papers @xcite monte carlo evolutionary models for three clusters are described : m4 , ngc6397 and 47 tuc .",
    "the number of black holes throughout the evolution , which was not discussed much in these papers , is plotted in fig.[fig : nbh ] . in our model of m4 ,",
    "no natal kicks were applied to black holes , but the population had decreased from about 1000 to one by an age of about 9gyr ( see ( * ? ? ? * fig.15 ) ) , and the last black hole escaped before 12gyr .",
    "the last black holes were expelled from our model of ngc6397 even earlier .",
    "the contrast with our model of 47 tuc is striking .",
    "though natal kicks ( with a 1-dimensional dispersion of 190km / s ) were applied , and the number of retained black holes decreased abruptly to 34 ( near the left margin of fig.[fig : nbh ] ) , more than half were still present at 12gyr .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide similar theoretically - based expectations for the globular cluster m22 ( ngc6656 ) , motivated by the recent discovery in that cluster of two stellar - mass black holes @xcite , which may even represent only a sample of a considerably larger population . from what has been",
    "said , our first step will be to construct a monte carlo evolutionary model which , like those of the other three clusters we have studied , resembles the star cluster at the present day .",
    "this we do in the following section by iterating on the initial conditions so that , after 12 gyr of evolution , the model provides an approximate fit to the observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of the cluster , and to its local stellar mass function ( or , strictly , luminosity function ) .",
    "we repeat the exercise for different assumptions about the natal kicks of stellar - mass black holes , in each case reporting the number which survive to 12 gyr ( sec.[sec : bhpop ] ) .",
    "our final section summarises our conclusions , and discusses them in the context of other recent research .",
    "our source for the surface brightness profile of m22 is the compilation of @xcite . as will be seen in fig.[fig : sbp ] , the data are quite scattered ( by about half a magnitude ) within the core , and ( surprisingly ) a little fainter inside the core than at the edge of the core .    for the velocity dispersion profile",
    "we have adopted results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig.3 ) .",
    "the cluster rotates , with a maximum projected rotation velocity of about 3km / s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.2 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this has been removed from their velocity dispersion profile . in any event",
    "the rotation is one dynamical property of the cluster which can not be modelled with the existing monte carlo technique ; this is confined to non - rotating and spherically symmetric systems .",
    "the stellar luminosity function we have used is the @xmath2 luminosity function at a projected radius of about 4.5 arcmin given by @xcite .",
    "this paper gives the data for each magnitude bin as the number of stars per ` hst area ' ; since the luminosity functions have been obtained from a single wfpc2 chip , we take this to be an area of 1.78 arcmin@xmath3 .",
    "most other data on m22 ( distance , metallicity , extinction ) have been taken from the on - line revision of december 2010 of the harris catalogue @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the binary abundance , where we have adopted a value of around 0.05 from the detailed results of @xcite .",
    "those results cover the region within the half - mass radius , and the fraction inside the core .",
    "in fact changing the binary fraction within reasonable limits makes no difference to the overall evolution .",
    "the initial conditions we have adopted are similar ( except of course for several numerical values , given in secs.[sec : ics ] ) to those used in our previous papers ( see especially ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ) .",
    "briefly these are king models , with no initial mass segregation .",
    "the single stars have a two - part power law initial mass function in the range from 0.1 to 100@xmath4 , while the initial properties of the binaries are taken from @xcite .",
    "the galactic tide is implemented as described in @xcite , but in any implementation it has to be treated as static in the monte carlo model .",
    "note that @xcite give for m22 an orbit with apo- and peri - galactic distances of about @xmath5 and @xmath6kpc , respectively , corresponding to an eccentricity ( defined as @xmath7 ) of @xmath8 .",
    "there is , however , substantial evidence from @xmath0-body simulations that a cluster on such an orbit retains a remarkably steady profile throughout each orbit @xcite , and loses mass at a rate like a cluster on a circular orbit at a fixed intermediate radius @xcite . for the age of the cluster",
    "we have adopted 12gyr , though it could be even older @xcite ; and for the metallicity we have taken @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the procedure now is to choose parameters specifying the initial conditions ( see table [ tab : models ] ) so as to optimise the fit of an evolved monte carlo model ( sec.[sec : model ] ) to the observational data ( sec.[sec : observations ] ) . in our previous papers ,",
    "this has been a prolonged and laborious search , a process of trial and error guided by intuition . since then it has been substantially automated .",
    "our procedure now is to use the results of scaled models , i.e. monte carlo models with a number of stars @xmath10 much smaller than the number of stars in the star cluster , but adjusted so that the relaxation time of the scaled model is the same as that of the actual cluster ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.4 ) ) . then a measure of goodness of fit is constructed along @xmath11 lines ; for each kind of data ( surface brightness , velocity dispersion and luminosity function ) we adopt a single measure of the dispersion of the error , one for each kind of data , and based on information in the sources quoted in sec.[sec : observations ] .",
    "these are normalised by the number of data points in each kind of data , and simply summed , giving a measure @xmath12 of goodness of fit .",
    "( the monte carlo data are also subject to sampling error , but this has been ignored in the construction of @xmath12 . ) given values of the seven adjustable parameters in table [ tab : models ] ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , we run the monte carlo code and compute @xmath12 .",
    "to optimise over the parameter space we employ the downhill simplex algorithm , coded as _ amoeba _ in @xcite . for purposes of brevity in this paper",
    "we refer to this procedure as _",
    "icfind_.    it is remarkable that the method is successful , as the algorithm is designed for optimisation of a smooth function , whereas the results of the monte carlo code are stochastic",
    ". nevertheless it appears to converge , from a wide variety of starting points , after computation of order 50 - 100 models . for @xmath14",
    "this takes a few days . by `` convergence '' here",
    "we mean that the code finds a best model which can not be improved on in the number of iterations stated ; from other starting points , the best model may well be different .",
    "unfortunately , even with this automatic method , we do not have any quantitative way of deciding the range of acceptable models , which would require improvement of our procedure for defining and calculating @xmath12 , and much greater computational effort .",
    "furthermore , while computing the last 50 or so models , our experience is that the code evolves models with very similar initial conditions and chooses the best ; it is , in effect , sampling the distribution of models which all result from these initial conditions by different choices of random numbers .",
    "results for 100% expulsion of black holes by natal kicks , and for 100% retention , are given in columns 2 and 3 of table [ tab : ics ] , referred to as models a and c , respectively . from what has been said ,",
    "it is not known whether the differences between these initial conditions are significant .",
    "nevertheless it can be argued that the cluster will expand less with 100% expulsion @xcite , and therefore the larger value for the initial half - mass radius @xmath15 in this case is what would be expected .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] and [ fig : convergence - of - z ] give an impression of the convergence of the run with 100% retention .",
    "we defer to the following subsection a discussion of how well the models agree with the observational data , as the full - sized models discussed in the next section are the focus of subsequent examination of the black hole population and its evolution .     and @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is the number of objects ( single stars and binary stars ) and @xmath15 is the half - mass radius , for the determination of initial conditions in the case of 100% retention of black holes .",

    "default large values of @xmath12 may occur if the model failed to reach the required age of 12gyr .",
    "large values may also occur close to the best - fitting value of @xmath0 ( about @xmath16 ) if other parameters are far from optimal .",
    ", width=340 ]    .initial conditions for m22 , and the resulting black hole population [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is useful to try to draw some general lessons about the surviving black hole populations in old globular clusters from the modelling of m22 described in this paper , and from similar models of a few other objects , summarised here in fig.[fig : nbh ] .",
    "some , like m4 and ngc6397 , lose all , or almost all , of their black holes well before the present day , while others ( 47 tuc and m22 ) retain a fraction ( assuming that natal kicks are moderated in some way ) .",
    "these facts are related to the evolution of the core .",
    "as we have seen ( fig.[fig : radii ] ) the core of m22 shows no sign of collapsing yet . even the very concentrated cluster 47",
    "tuc is no more than half - way to core collapse @xcite .",
    "of the four clusters which are under discussion , these are also the two with residual populations of black holes ( provided that kicks do not eject almost all new black holes ) .    the link between black hole populations and the evolution of the core has been noticed before @xcite , and is underpinned by a recent theoretical treatment by @xcite .",
    "these results show that expansion of the core ( and indeed of the half - mass radius ) can be driven by dynamical interactions among the black holes , which inevitably lead to their escape .",
    "eventually the population of black holes is insufficient to sustain the flow of energy by relaxation in the outer parts of the cluster , and then the core begins to .",
    "this phase of core ends at what @xcite call `` second core collapse '' ( the first being the original collapse of the black hole subsystem ) , when some other mechanism of generating energy ( e.g. primordial binaries ) becomes efficient enough .",
    "stellar evolution also contributes to the early expansion of the half - mass radius , @xcite showed that primordial binaries make little difference at the early stages .",
    "the upshot of th    is that populations of stellar - mass black holes are only to be expected in clusters which have not yet passed ( second ) core collapse .",
    "other things being equal , this means clusters which have a sufficiently long evolutionary time scale , and we note that the half - mass relaxation times of ngc6397 and m4 are under 1gyr ( @xmath17 , respectively , according to @xcite ) , while those of m22 and 47 tuc exceed 1gyr ( @xmath18 , respectively ) .",
    "these considerations allow us to synthesise not only our modelling of the four globular clusters that we have discussed , but also two other recent studies .    1 .",
    "@xcite also used a monte carlo code to study the problem , though the model was not specifically geared to m22 .",
    "the retention factor was high , about 86% , and more than half of the retained black holes still survived in the cluster at 12gyr .",
    "we estimate the half - mass relaxation time at 12gyr to be about @xmath19yr , though this is based on the half - mass radius , whereas the estimates above are based on the half - light radii . estimating these radii from model b ( fig.[fig : radii ] ) , we find that the comparable value of the half - mass relaxation time is about @xmath20yr , a little larger than the value for m22 .",
    "2 .   the other model which we mention here is a direct @xmath0-body model @xcite with @xmath21 initially , and a similar binary fraction to our monte carlo models .",
    "though smaller than m22 in mass , the larger initial radius of the @xmath0-body model gives it a value for the relaxation time at 12gyr of about 2.1gyr .",
    "the initial retention fraction was 10% , but even so 16 remained at 12gyr .",
    "naively , this would scale to about 50 for an initial model comparable in size to our suggested initial conditions for m22 .     despite this tidy picture ,",
    "mention must be made of m62 , which has a recently announced black hole candidate @xcite , despite an uncomfortably low relaxation time : @xmath22 .",
    "now we consider some aspects of the models which could have a bearing on these conclusions . in the first place we can make no claim for the uniqueness of the initial conditions we have derived . in particular ,",
    "if more compact initial conditions exist ( i.e. with a smaller half - mass radius ) , then the central escape velocity would be higher than in the existing models ( for example , about 57km / s at the start of model b ) , and the retention fraction of black holes would be greater , under any reasonable hypothesis on the magnitude .",
    "more problematic are aspects of the evolutionary history of globular clusters which are not modelled at present in the monte carlo code .",
    "it has recently been suggested @xcite that accretion of interstellar gas ( slow ejecta from stellar evolution ) will act as a resistive force on the motions of black holes .",
    "this takes us to perhaps the most popular scenario for the formation of second generations in galactic globular clusters ( see , for example , @xcite ) , in which the ejected gas sinks to the centre of the original cluster of first - generation stars , and forms a second generation , while much of the first generation escapes . no evolutionary simulation yet includes these complex processes , and one can only argue qualitatively about how this may affect our conclusions .    in this scenario it is often argued that the first generation may be more massive than the second . therefore the cluster in which the first generation of stellar - mass black holes formed would have had a much higher escape velocity than we have envisaged , making retention of a large fraction of these black holes much more likely",
    "they would be centrally concentrated ( by mass segregation ) , and would not be expected to escape , unlike much of the rest of the first generation .",
    "equally , it is hard to see how the survival of black holes in the second generation would be adversely affected by being immersed in the potential well of the remaining first generation .",
