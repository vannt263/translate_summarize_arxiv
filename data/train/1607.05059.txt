    ", there is a strong disc blackbody component in the x - ray spectrum , peaking at @xmath8 kev , followed by a pronounced high - energy tail , measured up to @xmath910 mev ( m02 ) .",
    "@xcite , hereafter mzc13 , detected high - energy @xmath2-ray emission from cyg x-1 based on observations by the large area detector ( lat ) on board of _ fermi_. the detection was at a @xmath10 significance , which corresponds to the chance probability of the detection of @xmath11 if the noise distribution is gaussian .",
    "moreover , that emission was present only in the hard spectral state , while only upper limits were found in the soft state .",
    "this ruled out the observed source being an artefact of the background subtraction , thus providing a strong argument for the emission actually coming from cyg x-1 .",
    "after the release of the new and much improved lat calibration in the summer of 2015 , pass 8 , and given the significantly increased on - source time with respect to the data analyzed in mzc13 , we have embarked on a new analysis , which results we present here . during our work , the work by @xcite ( hereafter z16 ) appeared .",
    "independently of our results , they have obtained the detection of @xmath2-ray emission from cyg x-1 , only in the hard state , at a @xmath1 level .",
    "they also found some evidence for orbital modulation of the flux , expected if the emission originates , at least partly , from compton scattering of stellar blackbody photons @xcite , which process we hereafter abbreviate as bbc . here , we provide results of our analysis of the emission and we extend the analysis of z16 by investigating in more detail the emission at the softest measured energies , studying in detail the orbital modulation , and developing theoretical models of the @xmath2-ray emission and its modulation .",
    "furthermore , we also present 15 ghz monitoring data from the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) , covering almost the entire duration of the lat observations analyzed here .    in our theoretical modelling , we adopt the parameters of cyg x-1 similar to those in mzc13 .",

[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ new ]    we then divide the available lat observations into the hard / intermediate and soft state . the inclusion of the intermediate state in the former category is motivated by the finding that the radio flux from cyg x-1 , which is seen to originate from the jet @xcite , is correlated with the x - ray flux in both the hard and intermediate states and it achieves its overall maximum in the latter .",
    "the decline of the radio emission takes place only in the soft state @xcite .",
    "the high - energy @xmath2-ray emission studied by us most likely also originates from the jet .",
    "we perform the division based on light curves from the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ; @xcite ) , maxi @xcite , and ami .",

    "the new correlator has the centre frequency of 15 ghz and a useful bandwidth of about 4 ghz ( compared to 15 ghz and 0.35 ghz , respectively , for the ryle ) .    from fig .  3 in @xcite",

    "thus , we use here the criterion of @xmath2712kev@xmath30 , @xmath2910kev@xmath31 to identify our hard / intermediate state .",

    "however , we have also detected cyg x-1 in the soft state with a very soft spectrum at lowest measured energies , 4080  mev , which is a new result . at higher energies , we have obtained upper limits , more restrictive than those in mzc13 , see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .    at energies",
    "@xmath060  mev , our results are almost identical to those of z16 .",
    "the duplicated points in the 0.040.1 energy range correspond to the two considered background models and show the expected level of systematic uncertainties at these energies .",
    "note that despite the high formal detection significance of cyg x-1 at 0.040.1  gev energies in both soft and hard states , the _",
    "fermi_/lat irf is poorly known at these energies , where the psf can be as broad as @xmath37 . together with the overall crowdedness of cyg x-1 region , this can lead to the source confusion problem , in which case the lowest energy _",
    "fermi_/lat spectral points rather show the overall level of the emission in cyg x-1 region and can , in principle , be also interpreted as upper limits . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft - state fluxes at @xmath38 mev are significantly higher than those in the hard state , in a pattern opposite to that at higher energies .",
    "this variability correlated with the spectral states of cyg x-1 would not be expected if it originated from background / source confusion effects , and it argues for the origin of the measured fluxes from cyg x-1 .",
    "we have then looked into a dependence of the hard - state emission on the orbital phase .",
    "such a dependence is expected if a substantial part of the emission is due to the bbc process @xcite .",
    "we have used the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "given the limited photon statistics available , we have divided the orbital phase , @xmath39 , into two parts only .",
    "we have found the energy fluxes in the orbital phases of @xmath40 ( around the superior conjunction ) and @xmath41 ( around the inferior conjunction ) of @xmath42 and @xmath43 erg @xmath35 s@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "thus , a modulation appears to be present , but still at a relatively low statistical significance .",
    "we have also looked at a possible offset of the maximum of the flux with respect to the zero orbital phase .",
    "such an offset would appear if the @xmath2-rays are emitted by the jet inclined with respect to the normal of the orbital plane .",
    "such a misalignment will appear if the jet is aligned with the black - hole rotation axis , which may be not be exactly perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "a similar offset , with the maximum of the folded light curve at a @xmath44 , was observed in cyg x-3 @xcite .",
    "we thus have moved the middle point of each orbital bin by @xmath45 .",
    "we have found that moving the bins to negative values has almost no effect on the observed modulation , for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , but a shift toward positive values causes the modulation to become much weaker , especially for the offset of @xmath48 .",
    "we show our results for @xmath49 , @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ orbital ] .",
    "this results suggest an offset of the peak modulation towards a negative value and asymmetric shape , similar to the case of cyg x-3 . given the limited statistics available , we are unable to determine this shape in detail .",
    "we have also searched for a possible dependence of the strength of the orbital modulation on energy , comparing , in particular , the modulation in the 0.11 gev and @xmath511 gev ranges .",
    "however , we have found no statistically significant differences .",
    "an orbital modulation was also found by z16 .",
    "they presented their results as maps of the cyg x-1 region in the hard state at the phase intervals of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the former map showed cyg x-1 much more clearly .",
    "they gave the ts values for the two images as 31 and 10 , respectively , which , at the phase value , would suggest a much stronger signal around the superior conjunction .",
    "however , those ts values are given only for the bin at the nominal position of cyg x-1 , while there is an offset of the signal , probably due to the limited pointing accuracy .",
    "when they take into account the entire cyg x-1 flux , the flux at @xmath52 mev for the @xmath53 bin is given by them as @xmath54 erg @xmath35 s@xmath18 , almost identical to the average hard - state flux in the same energy range given by them as @xmath55 erg @xmath35 s@xmath18 .",
    "this implies the orbital modulation much weaker than that we find .",
    "they report a larger ratio for the normalization of the fitted power - law spectra , but do not specify whether they kept the same spectral index for the two cases ( in which case only the integrated fluxes are proportional to the normalization ) .",
    "mzc13 presented a study of the implications of the lat upper limits and detections for models of accretion flows . here , we reconsider their analysis using our current measurements .",
    "we consider here only leptonic models , and refer to mzc13 for a critical discussion of the hadronic ones .",

    "we see that although both fits were obtained without any knowledge of the spectra at higher energies , they do fit the 40200 mev data well .",
    "we consider this coincidence as a strong argument for the reality of the detection of cyg x-1 at @xmath59 gev . in the hard state",

    "the maximum lorentz factor of the injected electrons is @xmath61 .",
    "the spectra are modified by absorption in photon - photon collisions of @xmath2-rays mainly with blackbody photons emitted by the disc , and producing e@xmath3 pairs .",
    "the degree of absorption is controlled by the compactness parameter , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the source luminosity and @xmath64 is the characteristic size . in the hard and soft states ,",
    "the size of the plasma assumed by m02 and @xcite is @xmath65 and @xmath66 cm , which corresponds to @xmath676 and @xmath68 , respectively , where @xmath69 is the gravitational radius .",
    "the observed cutoffs are caused by the pair absorption .",
    ".,width=264 ]    jet models were studied by mzc13 in the case of a fixed electron distribution , following @xcite and @xcite . given the strong radiative cooling present , in particular due to compton scattering on stellar blackbody photons , this is an unrealistic assumptions .",
    "self - consistent models with electron cooling for cyg x-1 were considered by @xcite , hereafter z14 , using the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "those models assume the profiles of the electron acceleration and magnetic field strength based on physical arguments and calculate the steady - state electron distribution through the jet and the jet emission from the synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , bbc and compton scattering of photons produced by the accretion flow . finally , the spectra are attenuated by e@xmath3 pair absorption , calculated along the jet taking into account the finite size of the donor star .",
    "we note here one major change required with respect to the models of z14 .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission of all those models was dominated by compton scattering of stellar blackbody photons ( bbc ) , while other contributions , in particular the ssc , made only minor contributions .",
    "thus , these models predict strong orbital modulation of the dominant blackbody - scattering component , by a factor of several , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "11 of z14 .",
    "this is incompatible with the observed relatively weak orbital modulation , see fig .",
    "[ orbital ] .",
    "we note here that a similarly weak orbital modulation is seen during active periods of cyg x-3 , see fig .  3 of @xcite , in which the peak of the @xmath2-ray folded light curve was at a level of only @xmath671.3 of the minimum . in that case , most of the emission at the minimum level was attributed to a diffuse and/or source persistent and not orbitally modulated flux .",
    "this allowed @xcite to model that emission entirely in terms of compton scattering of blackbody photons . in principle , a similar situation may take place in cyg x-1 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] that the upper limits in the soft state are at relatively similar levels to the hard - state detections .",
    "thus , there could be a persistent component of a different nature at a level just below the minimum of the orbital modulation , which would imply the actual orbital modulation in the hard state to be much stronger .",
    "however , given that this issue can not be resolved with the available data , we have searched for jet models giving low orbital modulation .",
    "apart from the bbc component , there are also components due to scattering of accretion photons and ssc .",
    "the former depends on the accretion flux , which is relatively well constrained by x - ray observations , so there is not much freedom to increase that component . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio between the bbc and ssc fluxes depends on the ratio of the densities of the blackbody and synchrotron photons .",
    "( in order to minimize this ratio , we have assumed the minimum stellar luminosity compatible with observations , see section [ intro ] . )",
    "we have searched over a large grid of models yielding the radio and @xmath2-ray fluxes as observed in cyg x-1 , but have found that all of them have the bbc component dominating over ssc .",
    "however , an effect that increases the relative importance of ssc vs.  external compton is clumping @xcite .",
    "we consider physical conditions in which the accelerated electrons within the jet form @xmath70 clouds filling a fraction @xmath71 of the volume .",
    "simple calculations show that this changes the ssc flux ( while leaving the synchrotron and external compton fluxes unchanged ) by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we need a small number of high - density clumps filling a small fraction of the jet volume for this effect to substantially increase the ssc flux .",
    "we have found that we need @xmath73 , i.e. , a strongly clumped jet , for the ssc flux to be comparable to the blackbody compton one .    given the relatively weak observational constraints ,",
    "we have found a number of models yielding similar radio and @xmath2-ray spectra , see also discussion in z14 .",
    "we show our best model in fig .",
    "[ jet_model ] .",
    "the model parameters are as follows .",
    "the relativistic electrons are accelerated above the lorentz factor of @xmath74 with the index of @xmath75 .",
    "the acceleration begins at the distance of about @xmath76 from the black hole , and the magnetic field strength at that point is @xmath77 g. see z14 and @xcite for a full description of the model .",
    "the ssc component at high - energy @xmath2-rays is slightly stronger than the bbc one , and scattering of disc photons is negligible .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ jet_model ] the average broad - band spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "we note that the hard x - ray / soft @xmath2-ray spectrum of @xcite is much harder than those of m02 , @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "@xcite neither notice nor discuss that discrepancy . given that ambiguity ,",
    "we have chosen to show here the spectra of m02 and @xcite .",
    "we also show the accretion model of m02 , the same as in fig .",
    "[ accretion_model ] . as shown on both figs .",
    "[ accretion_model ] and [ jet_model ] , it predicts well the lowest - energy point from the lat .",
    "the orbital modulation predicted by the jet model is shown in fig .",
    "[ orbital_model ] .",
    "it is slightly stronger than that of the best fit , but compatible the observed one within errors .",
    "we note that the adopted model treats the stellar blackbody emission as a point source ( as in @xcite ) , while the stellar radius is as large as @xmath671/2 of the binary separation .",
    "taking this effect into account significantly reduces the predicted modulation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the jet may precess , though the presence and magnitude of this effect has not yet been constrained @xcite .",
    "precession will change the phases of the maximum and minimum fluxes , which will further reduce the average orbital modulation .",
    "also , variability of the emission will reduce the averaged orbital modulation , due to the dependence of the profile of the @xmath2-ray emission on the mass flow rate through the jet @xcite .",

    "we have detected a steady emission in the 0.0460 gev energy band in the hard and intermediate spectral state .",

    "the used models were obtained based on data at @xmath80 mev only , but they predict well the current measurements . this agreement appears to support the reality of the lat detection at the lowest energies .",
