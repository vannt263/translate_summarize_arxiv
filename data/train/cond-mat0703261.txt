    "the principal roadblock impeding progress in disentangling the physics of the cuprate superconductors is arguably our inability to access quantum ground states of two - dimensional itinerant electrons which are qualitatively distinct from a landau fermi liquid . overcoming this obstruction is of paramount importance , indispensable in explaining the strange metal behavior observed near optimal doping and a likely requisite to account for the emergent pseudo - gap at lower energies .",
    "a putative underlying paramagnetic mott insulator provides the scaffolding for a popular class of theories , which view the pseudo - gap as a lightly doped spin liquid .",
    "@xcite significant progress has been made in developing the groundwork and there now exists a well established theoretical framework to describe a myriad of distinct spin liquids . for the cuprates",
    "the most promising spin liquids are described in terms of fermionic spinons minimally coupled to a compact @xmath1 gauge field and moving in various background fluxes . upon doping formidable challenges",
    "bosonic holons carrying the electron charge become mobile carriers and lead to electrical conduction . but at low temperatures bose condensation appears inevitable and this leads to fermi liquid behavior , either a metal with conventional landau quasiparticles or a bcs superconductor if the spinons are paired . accessing a pseudo - gap or a strange metal which conduct electricity despite the absence of long - lived landau quasiparticles requires doped holons that form an uncondensed quantum bose fluid rather than a condensed superfluid . but is this possible , even in principle ?",
    "if possible , what properties would such a putative `` bose metal '' exhibit?@xcite and what theoretical framework is appropriate ?",
    "the slave - particle gauge theory approach has been stymied by this stumbling block for over 15 years . in this paper",

    "specifically we have in mind hard core bosons moving on a 2d square lattice , but seek to construct states which do not require particular commensurate densities . while our construction can be implemented for bosons moving in the 2d continuum euclidean plane , the states will only possess the reduced point group symmetry of the square lattice . despite our interest in time reversal invariant quantum ground states ,",
    "our technical approach will be strongly informed by theories of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) . in some regards ,",
    "the quantum phases that we construct are time reversal invariant analogs of the laughlin state for bosons in a half - filled landau level .",

    "this choice is constrained by symmetry : all the physical symmetries of the boson model , even if not respected by the mean field ansatz , must be present in the full gauge theory once gauge transformations are allowed .",

    "the symmetries of the euclidean plane together with time reversal invariance are more restrictive and we can only offer two psg mean field ansatze in this case .",

    "example , each fermi surface is invariant under the rotation but not under the mirrors , which instead are realized by interchanging the two fermions .    each of the four presented ansatze can be loosely called a d - wave bose liquid as far as the nodal pictures like that in fig .",

    "but in practice the gauge theory approach allows incorporation of slowly varying gauge fluxes and is different in this respect from the wavefunction .",
    "provided the gauge theory is not in a confined state and no physical symmetries are broken , an exact description of the putative dbl phase is thereby obtained .",
    "herein , we introduce a large @xmath35 generalization of the gauge theory which allows a controlled and systematic treatment of the gauge fluctuations order by order in powers of @xmath36 .",
    "we can then perturbatively extract physical properties of the dbl phase . whether the dbl phase survives down to @xmath37 is not something that we can reliably address .",
    "in describing the d@xmath31 liquid phase for lattice bosons there is considerable freedom when choosing the precise form of the slave fermion hopping in the mean field hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest choice is near neighbor hopping with different amplitudes in the @xmath14 and @xmath21 directions .",
    "but even with this restriction , there are two different possible fermi surface topologies , closed or open , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : introfs ] .",

    "this is a distinct quantum phase which we refer to as a d - wave local bose liquid ( dlbl ) .",
    "the dlbl is intrinsically very stable against gauge fluctuations and we are fairly confident that when present it will be a stable quantum phase .",

    "as the direction of @xmath41 is rotated in real space , the wave vectors @xmath40 and @xmath43 trace out closed momentum space curves , and for the dbl in the continuum these curves will have the topology of a circle .",
    "if one measures the boson green s function and finds it to be of the above form , it is natural to refer to the @xmath43 as `` bose surfaces . '' within the gauge theory description the origin of these singular surfaces can be traced to the fermi surfaces of the constituent fermions .",
    "specifically , @xmath40 are locations on the two fermi surfaces where the surface normals are along the observation direction @xmath41 , and the momentum space areas enclosed by each of these surfaces will equal @xmath44 . note that the @xmath40 surfaces can be uniquely reconstructed from the measured bose surfaces @xmath43 . in this sense ,",
    "the bose surfaces in the dbl contain information analogous to luttinger s fermi surface volume theorem in the fermi liquid .",
    "the bose surface can also be extracted directly from the dbl wavefunction by using variational monte carlo to compute the equal time boson green s function , and can also be indirectly inferred by using the shape of the two fermi surfaces input into the @xmath18 and @xmath19 factors .",
    "it is both reassuring and quite remarkable that these two coincide .",
    "the spatially local green s function , @xmath45 , in the dbl falls off in time as a power law which is at least as slow as @xmath46 corresponding to the local boson tunneling density of states @xmath47 ; these are mean field results obtained by combining two fermions each with a finite density of states , but we suspect the time decay may actually be slower upon including gauge fluctuations .",

    "paradoxically , this seems to imply that a pair of bosons injected into the dlbl on opposite corners of a square box can move more readily than a single injected boson .",
    "but in a strongly interacting quantum state such a single - particle interpretation can be misleading  the dynamics of an injected boson is not that of a weakly interacting quasiparticle .    in both",

    "measurement of such correlation can be used to extract @xmath40 in the dlbl , which are not accessible from the boson green s function here . upon rotating the unit vector @xmath41 in real space ,",
    "@xmath40 will again trace out the fermi surfaces of the underlying fermions which for the dlbl will be open . both the dbl and the dlbl are conductors with a resistance varying with temperature as @xmath56 .",
    "this is particularly striking for the dlbl where the boson green s function is short - ranged .",
    "evidently , it is not possible to understand the metallic transport in terms of the motion of weakly interacting bosons . in a sense it is the fermionic constituents which transport the charge , but even this is not quite right since the @xmath57 fermions do not exist as well defined quasiparticle excitations , being strongly scattered by the gauge fluctuations .",
    "the lattice gauge theory formulation can be used to motivate a lattice boson hamiltonian which might plausibly have the dbl / dlbl as a ground state .",
    "the simplest such model consists of a near neighbor boson hopping term supplemented by a four - site  ring \" exchange term : @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this model is fully specified by two dimensionless numbers , the ratio @xmath60 and the boson filling @xmath61 .",

    "the effects of interactions between the two injected fermions appear at order @xmath36 , entering as vertex corrections .",
    "since the two fermion species have opposite gauge charge , one expects that they will attract one another . as we shall see , though",

    "for example , a pair of particles with the same charge ( @xmath419 ) experience a suppressed vertex interaction , @xmath420 , when their group velocities are antiparallel .",
    "the absence of singular vertex corrections when the two patch fermions have parallel group velocities , @xmath421 , is , we believe , not just a peculiarity of this lowest order contribution , but will be valid generally for the exact vertices at arbitrary @xmath35 .",

    "( [ psi_jastrow ] ) , and use the pseudopotential @xmath628 with two variational parameters @xmath206 and @xmath92 . allowing more parameters such as an independent nearest - neighbor pseudopotential does not visibly change the optimized energies .",
    "interestingly , as deduced from the energetics , the superfluid - dbl phase boundary roughly coincides with the limit of vanishing d - eccentricity @xmath629 .",
    "the resulting @xmath211 wavefunction is positive , and , as we discussed at length in sec .",
    "[ sec : wavefnc_props ] , this state has off - diagonal long range order .",
    "of course , it does not have the same long - wavelength correlations as the superfluid ( e.g. , it has unusual @xmath169 density correlations ) , but it appears to have reasonable short - range correlations .    finally , we also remark that in the present @xmath577 study , the optimal dbl phase when it wins over the superfluid is in fact the dlbl phase with open fermi surfaces discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : openfs ] and is in the regime where the boson green s function decays exponentially in all directions . as we discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : mft ] and [ sec : wavefnc_props ] , despite such `` locality '' in the boson correlator , this unusual phase is still critical with many low energy excitations .",
    "summarizing , the dbl wavefunction is able to interpolate between the ebl and the superfluid regimes in the frustrated @xmath577 model .",
    "this is the main argument supporting our proposal that the ground state of the ring hamiltonian in the intermediate regime is in the dlbl phase .",
    "our main results were summarized in the introduction , so here we only highlight the most interesting points and discuss possible future directions . we are searching for examples of uncondensed quantum boson liquids that respect time reversal and occur at generic continuously varying densities . in this paper , we proposed several wavefunctions that produce such liquids and studied in detail the specific states dubbed dbl and dlbl .",
    "while the initial wavefunction construction appears somewhat ad - hoc , we argued that it is no more so than the slave particle construction of spin liquid states in frustrated antiferromagnets , which has been developed to maturity over the last two decades .",
    "we introduced a particular slave fermion treatment of hard core bosons on a square lattice that corresponds to the proposed dbl wavefunctions .",
    "this approach allows to go beyond the trial ground state wavefunction , suggesting natural excitations , and eventually leads to a gauge theory description of the low - energy properties of the putative boson liquid phase . using techniques previously developed for the so - called uniform rvb spin liquid with a fermi sea of spinons , we argued for the possible stability of the new dbl phases to gauge fluctuations and found the dlbl regime to be particularly stable . within the gauge theory formulation",
    ", we also analyzed boson and boson density correlators at long distances , which reveal special singular surfaces in the momentum space .",
    "the singular surfaces were confirmed by measuring the properties of the proposed dbl / dlbl wavefunctions directly ; in the same numerics , no potential orders were observed , indicating stability of the states .",
    "we remark here that the gutzwiller wavefunctions and the gauge theory should not be viewed as identical descriptions , and , in particular , the detailed long - distance properties may be different .",
    "the gutzwiller wavefunctions can be used for crude energetics and qualitative characterization , but in our opinion the gauge theory is more complete as far as the actual quantum phase is concerned .",
    "indeed , the wavefunctions as constructed do not incorporate any dynamics of the gauge fluxes , which are clearly additional low - energy `` variational '' degrees of freedoms that the quantum system is going to explore and utilize .",
    "from the singular momentum surfaces in the boson properties , one can in principle recover the underlying fermi surfaces of the slave particle construction ; the latter have correct volumes for the boson density , offering a tantalizing possibility of some `` luttinger theorem '' for uncondensed liquids of interacting bosons .",
    "some striking thermodynamic properties of the proposed boson liquids follow from their fermion - gauge character.@xcite in both the dbl and dlbl phases , because of the gapless fermi surfaces and the gauge interactions , the specific heat at low temperatures is expected to behave as @xmath630 , while the resistivity is expected to vanish as @xmath631 .",
    "the last result in the dbl phase with closed fermi surfaces is simply a quote from earlier studies of such fermi sea - gauge systems,@xcite while the case with open fermi surfaces requires slightly more care .",
    "our argument is based on the application of the ioffe - larkin rule@xcite which gives the boson resistivity as @xmath632 . for the fermi surfaces as in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : introfs ] , and the conductivity measured , say , in the @xmath108 direction , the small - angle scattering by the gauge field can effectively degrade the @xmath24 fermion current , therefore the standard result @xmath633 . on the other hand",
    ", such scattering can not completely degrade the @xmath23 fermion current , so @xmath634 , and @xmath631 follows .",
    "( parenthetically , the @xmath23 current can be degraded by quartic or more particle interactions , but such contributions vanish as @xmath635 or faster . )    intriguingly , in the dlbl phase , the boson correlators are expected to be short - ranged despite such manifest thermodynamic signatures of gaplessness and criticality . on the other hand ,",
    "the boson box correlator in the dlbl decays as a power law and is negative , @xmath396 , offering perhaps a more physical glimpse of the fermionic partons in this phase .",
    "indeed , consider inserting bosons at @xmath636 and @xmath637 and removing at @xmath638 and @xmath639 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the box correlator comes from the @xmath23 fermions propagating @xmath640 and @xmath641 , while the @xmath24 paths are @xmath642 and @xmath643 , which is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : partons ] . the minus sign of the box correlator is then due to one fermionic exchange needed so that the two pairs of injected fermions are removed with the same pairing .",
    "the proposed dbl / dlbl wavefunctions do not satisfy marshall signs , and their interesting sign structure is brought out by the nodal pictures in the continuum such as fig .  [",
    "fig : nodes ] , which give some caricature of the wavefunction signs also on the lattice even though the nodes are not sharply defined in this case .",
    "clearly , these wavefunctions can not be ground states of boson models without frustration . to address the question of what hamiltonians may stabilize such phases , we considered a particular frustrated hard core boson model with competing hopping and four - site ring exchange terms , and our energetics study suggests that the dlbl state is a good candidate in this model near half - filling .",
    "unfortunately , the frustrated nature of the boson motion makes this model not suitable for large system quantum monte carlo studies . we still suggest it as an interesting model for numerical studies such as exact diagonalization of small systems or dmrg",
    "; the gapless nature of the boson liquid may make results hard to interpret , but the short - range character of the correlations and particularly the quasi - local nature of the dlbl phase can perhaps facilitate dmrg to access larger systems .    looking ahead",
    ", we now describe one of the main drives behind the study of uncondensed boson liquids , despite its own intrinsic interest .",
    "we are searching for electronic conducting non - fermi liquids , and the ideas of the present work suggest some avenues in this direction . as a specific example , consider the slave boson approach that is popular in the context of the @xmath644 model of high-@xmath288 superconductors .",
    "the electron operator is written as @xmath645 , leading to a theory of spinons and slave bosons strongly coupled via an emergent fluctuating gauge field .",
    "phenomenologically , a fermi sea of spinons is very appealing in the strange metal , but what about the slave bosons ?",
    "if they condense , we would recover the conventional fermi liquid .",
    "it has been argued that the fluctuating gauge field frustrates the motion of the bosons and suppresses the tendency to condense.@xcite if this suppression could persist to zero temperature , we would obtain a conducting non - fermi liquid state .",
    "such a possibility is precisely what we are trying to establish in the present work , and our approach would be to write the slave boson in terms of new ( second generation ) slave fermions , @xmath98 .    on the level of wavefunctions",
    ", we would then write an electronic state of the form : @xmath646 ( \\up , \\dn ) \\,\\ , \\det(\\up ) \\ , \\det(\\dn ) ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where schematically @xmath647 or @xmath648 denotes locations of all electrons with spin - up or spin - down respectively .",
    "each determinant in the slave boson wavefunction @xmath649 evaluates appropriate @xmath16-particle orbitals at the locations of all electrons irrespective of their spin , which assures the no - double occupancy constraint .",
    "there is significant freedom in specifying these orbitals , and whether such wavefunctions are useful for any electronic system requires detailed energetics studies of specific hamiltonians .",
    "one can nevertheless develop a low - energy theory of such a @xmath650 phase in the spirit of the present paper , thereby obtaining an itinerant non - fermi liquid conducting phase .",
    "if the dbl or dlbl bosonic states studied in this work appear as useful caricatures of the behavior of the electronic charge , we may even call the resulting phase a `` d - wave metal '' ! such all - fermion description of electrons on the square lattice with no double occupancy has some phenomenological appeal , but detailed explorations are left for future work .",
