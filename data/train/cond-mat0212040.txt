    "the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in periodic potentials is a central paradigm of physics , finding applications from condensed matter physics to optics , and from nonlinear dynamics to atomic and to plasma physics . in recent years",
    ", the experimental and theoretical study of quantum - degenerate atomic systems in periodic potentials has opened up new avenues of investigation . in particular ,",
    "bose - einstein condensates are a macroscopic quantum system that is amenable to exquisite experimental control . as a result",
    ", many phenomena studied in solid state systems can be re - examined in a more direct and dramatic fashion .",
    "even more importantly perhaps , it is now possible to realize experimentally model systems that had previously been the object of considerable theoretical studies , but were all but impossible to test experimentally .",
    "one particularly beautiful example is the experimental realization of the hubbard model leading to the demonstration of the superfluid to mott insulator transition in a bose condensate of @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite .",
    "the first experiments involving the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in periodic potentials were carried out by anderson and kasevich , who used this approach to demonstrate a mode - locked atom laser @xcite and observe atomic josephson oscillations @xcite .",
    "the list of phenomena that were subsequently experimentally demonstrated and/or theoretically investigated includes the generation of atomic number squeezing @xcite , the observation of the superfluid - mott insulator phase transition , the generation of discrete @xcite or gap solitons @xcite , the prediction of modulational instabilities @xcite and superfluid flow @xcite , the observation of bloch oscillations @xcite , the analysis and observation of coherent acceleration @xcite , studies of magnetism @xcite , etc .",
    "it is well known that a particle confined to an infinite periodic potential and acted upon by an external force behaves as if possessing an effective mass that can be substantially different from its true mass , and may even take negative values . in particular , it is this property that is at the core of proposals to generate bright matter - wave solitons in becs with repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend these studies by analyzing the temporal evolution of a condensate in the periodic potential provided by an optical lattice .",
    "the initial state of the condensate is chosen to be a ( approximate ) bloch state modulated by a slow - varying gaussian envelope , and we compare two situations where the bloch state is either associated with a positive or a negative effective mass . we show that in situations where the dynamics of the condensate is well approximated by a negative effective mass , the periodic potential can lead to the stabilization of an otherwise unstable condensate .",
    "we also demonstrate theoretically the levitation of condensates of negative effective masses .",
    "these studies further allow us to determine the impact of self - interactions and of finite condensate widths on the general usefulness of the effective mass concept .",

    "we proceed by expanding the condensate wave function @xmath39 on the complete set of bloch functions @xmath40 that are the stationary solutions of the associated linear schrdinger equation @xmath41 \\phi_{n{\\bf k}}({\\bf r } ) = e_{n{\\bf k}}\\ , \\phi_{n{\\bf k}}({\\bf r } ) .",

    "our use of the resulting expansion , @xmath46 is motivated by the the fact that the bloch functions can capture the rapid oscillations of the condensate wave function , while the slowly varying envelope functions @xmath47 will describe the slow center - of - mass motion of the condensate .",
    "the equations of motion for the amplitudes @xmath47 are found by inserting the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) into the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "the resulting equations are however of little use if a very large number of @xmath47 is required to accurately describe the dynamics of the condensate . here",
    ", we consider a more specialized situation where the matter - wave field is characterized by a central wave vector @xmath48 corresponding to the mean velocity of the condensate ( this would correspond to the carrier wave in conventional optics ) .",

    "here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are cartesian components of @xmath54 and we use an implicit summation over repeated indices . the velocity @xmath55 is the drift velocity of the @xmath42-th band contribution to the condensate envelope .",

    "we note that @xmath57 vanishes at the extreme points of the band , in particular at the band edges .",

    "( [ gpe * ] ) ,    @xmath63    [ fstar ]    this equation shows that as compared to the case of a positive effective mass , the condensate density envelope profile @xmath64 evolves now under the influence of an inverted external potential @xmath65 and an inverted nonlinearity @xmath66 .",
    "as expected , though , the three - body recombination rate does not change sign and still represents a loss term .",
    "the change in sign of @xmath58 and @xmath67 leads to a number of consequences .",
    "in particular , past work has shown how this property can be exploited to launch bright matter - wave solitons in condensates with positive scattering length @xcite and induce modulational instability @xcite . the following section explores further consequences of this property .",
    "we first investigate the effect of an inverted nonlinearity .",
    "as is well known , this will change the two - body interaction from being repulsive to attractive , and vice versa .",
    "since condensates with attractive interactions are normally unstable against collapse , the sign change of @xmath28 is clearly expected to have a significant effect .    to reduce the scale of the computation , we restrict ourselves to a two - dimensional system consisting of a pancake - shaped condensate whose axial motion is frozen to the trap ground state .",
    "( we note that condensates with reduced dimensions have already been realized in the laboratory @xcite . ) furthermore , to focus on the effects of the nonlinearity , we assume that except for the lattice potential @xmath68 , \\ ] ] there is no additional external potential in the transverse dimensions .",
    "the evolution of the transverse component @xmath69 of the condensate wave function is then given by the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath70 \\psi_\\bot,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 for the initial state of the condensate , we assume a gaussian transverse wave function of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 $ ] is a slowly varying gaussian envelope function of width @xmath74 , @xmath75 is a bloch wave function of the linear hamiltonian , and the constant @xmath76 normalizes @xmath69 to unity .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] illustrate the dynamics of the condensate for two cases , one corresponding to a negative effective mass and the other to a positive one .",
    "we choose the bloch wave function @xmath75 associated with a negative effective mass @xmath28 as @xmath77 this corresponds approximately to the bloch state at the top of the first energy band , whose full expression is given by @xmath78 of eq .",
    "( [ neg ] ) . the approximate form ( [ neg1 ] ) retains only the dominant term in the fourier series ( [ neg ] ) .",
    "its overlap with @xmath78 is larger than 99% for the parameters of our simulations .",
    "similarly , for the state of positive effective mass @xmath28 we use @xmath79 which corresponds roughly to the bloch state @xmath80 at the bottom of the second band , see eq .",
    "( [ pos ] ) .",
    "both states ( [ neg1 ] ) and ( [ pos1 ] ) are located at the edge of the first brillouin zone , with corresponding drift velocities @xmath81 .",
    "hence the center of the condensate stays at @xmath82 during the course of its time evolution .",
    "the dimensionless time is @xmath83=0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 from the top to bottom . in the plots ,",
    "the ranges for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are from @xmath86 to 30 .",
    "the condensate parameters are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the width of the initial envelope function @xmath92 . the units for time , length and energy are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively , where @xmath96 is the trap frequency in the axial direction.,width=264,height=430 ]    the two columns in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show snapshots of the density distribution of the condensate for positive ( left column ) and negative ( right column ) effective masses @xmath28 . in both cases the nonlinear interaction strength @xmath37 is negative , hence in the absence of the lattice the condensate would be unstable and subject to collapse .",
    "this however can be changed if the effective mass of the bec becomes negative , as demonstrated in the right column . in that case",
    ", the condensate behaves as if experiencing a repulsive two - body interaction , its width increasing in time .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation for a positive effective mass , in which case the condensate width quickly implodes @xcite .",
    "this implosion is characterized by a complex dynamical behavior , such as the formation of atomic `` bursts , '' observed at later times .",
    "( we remark that while an attractive condensate can expand if it possesses a sufficiently large kinetic energy , this is not the case of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the two initial states have nearly identical kinetic energies . )",
    "the collapse dynamics depicted here is rather similar to that of an attractive condensate in a harmonic potential , a system which has gained much interest recently as a result of the capability of tuning the scattering length from positive to negative via feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "we note however that the use of the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation becomes questionable in the regime of extreme collapse .",
    "this point though it is important , is not central to our results .",
    "same parameters as in fig .",
    ", width=264 ]    we conclude this section by observing that the number of condensate atoms decreases in time , due to the presence of three - body loss .",
    "this is particularly evident for the state with positive effective mass , as shown in fig .",
    "this is as expected , since the atomic density is higher in that case .",
    "finally , we note that as a result of the tensorial character of the effective mass , it can readily be positive along some dimensions and negative along others .",
    "for example , in two dimensions a condensate wave function of the form @xmath97 has an effective mass that is negative along @xmath84 and positive along @xmath85-direction .",
    "this leads to a situation where the condensate will expand along @xmath84 and contract along @xmath85 , as has been numerically confirmed .",
    "we mentioned that if a condensate of negative effective mass is subject to an external potential @xmath35 that varies slowly over the lattice period , then this potential will appear inverted to the condensate .",
    "for example , under the effect of gravity , the center of mass of the condensate will climb up , rather than fall down . to demonstrate this effect , we solve the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath98 represents the gravitational potential , @xmath99 being a constant .",
    "we neglect the three - body loss term , which is not essential in the present discussion .",
    "again , we assume that the initial condensate wave function is a broad gaussian envelope function centered at @xmath100 , modulated by a sinusoidal function .",
    "taking that modulation of the form @xmath101 yields a state of negative effective mass @xmath28 , while @xmath102 gives a state of positive effective mass .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) illustrates the evolution of the center of mass of the condensate for these two cases . as expected from the previous discussion",
    ", we see that it initially climbs up for negative @xmath28 and falls down for positive @xmath28 .     when the center of mass of the condensate reaches maximum height .",
    "the dashed line shows the initial gaussian envelope function for reference .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath103 , @xmath92 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , in the same dimensionless units as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is used .",
    ", width=264 ]    as the center of mass of the condensate of negative effective mass climbs up against the gravitational field , its gravitational potential energy increases .",
    "this increase must be offset by a decrease in kinetic energy ( assuming for the sake of argument that the nonlinear interaction energy is negligible ) .",
    "since the initial condensate possesses a finite kinetic energy , roughly given by @xmath107 , conservation of energy therefore sets an upper limit on how high its center of mass can climb .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . a good estimate for the maximum height can be obtained from @xmath108 where the left hand side is about half of the initial kinetic energy and the right hand side is the maximum gain in gravitational energy . for lithium atoms in an optical lattice formed by laser light of wavelength of 0.5 @xmath109 m",
    ", one finds that @xmath110 is about 0.4 mm , a rather significant distance in the context of integrated atom optics @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4](b ) compares the condensate density distribution at the maximum height to its initial envelope profile .    that a maximum height should exist demonstrates the limit of the effective mass formalism , since a literal interpretation of the effective mass equation ( [ gpe * ] )",
    "would incorrectly lead one to conclude that in the case of negative effective mass , the condensate should move against the gravitational field without bound .",
    "the incorrectness of this reasoning lies in the fact that eq .",
    "( [ gpe * ] ) neglects all terms coupling different bloch modes ( see derivation in appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "what happens in reality is that as the condensate moves under the combined influence of the external potential and of its intrinsic nonlinear potential , other bloch modes with different quasi - momenta than those initially excited inevitably become populated .",
    "this in turn changes the effective mass of the system , or even makes this band - specific concept meaningless . in the present example",
    ", the effective mass changes its sign to positive at the maximum height as successive energy bands become excited . in the mean time , the oscillations in the density profile have a contrast less than one [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] which shows that the phase of the wave function at maximum height becomes spatially continuous ( otherwise , the density would vanish at each phase singularities ) while the initial wave function possesses a series of @xmath11-phase jumps .",
    "we conclude this section with some general comments on the generation and robustness of condensate states of negative effective mass .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ neg1 ] ) , the condensate wave function suffers a @xmath11-phase jump every lattice period .",
    "this immediately suggests that these states can be prepared by the phase - imprinting method that has been previously successfully implemented to generate dark solitons as in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , due to edge effects and inaccuracy in controlling the intensity of the phase imprinting pulse , this method may not be fully adequate to generate a series of accurate @xmath11-jumps as required by eq .",
    "( [ neg1 ] ) .",
    "a better choice may therefore consist in first preparing a condensate with uniform phase in a specific electronic state .",
    "taking advantage of the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms , one can then drive the condensate into another internal state with an optical field of appropriate topological spatial geometry .",
    "the resulting center - of - mass wave function of the condensate having then the correct phase structure .",
    "this method has been successfully used in the past to create a series of accurate @xmath11-phase jumps in condensates @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion of the robustness of condensate states of negative effective mass .",
    "as we have mentioned , the state ( [ neg1 ] ) is only an approximation to the true bloch state ( [ neg ] ) .",
    "the overlap between these two states decreases as @xmath111 increases .",
    "furthermore , @xmath112 decreases with increasing @xmath111 , as the system approaches the tight - binding regime . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath111 can not be made too small , since the size of the gap between the first and second energy band is itself proportional to @xmath111 , and a small gap will result in inter - band transitions to a state of positive effective mass .",
    "the optimal value od @xmath111 also depends on other system parameters , and as a result we found that @xmath113 turned out to be optimal for our purpose .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamics of an atomic condensate in a periodic optical lattice using an effective mass method .",
    "we have obtained an effective equation of motion governing the time evolution of the envelope of the condensate wave function in which the periodic external potential appears in the form of an effective mass , which can be either positive or negative , and a global drift .",
    "numerical calculation confirmed that this envelope function approach provides us with useful qualitative insight into the condensate dynamics .",
    "our study focused on negative effective masses , in which case the condensate behaves as if it subject to an inverted nonlinearity and an inverted external potential .",
    "we emphasize that caution must be used when applying the effective mass concept , which neglects the potentially important coupling between different bloch modes .",
    "this is particularly so for a system with negative effective mass moving in an external potential , as illustrated in sec .",
    "[ gravity ] .",
    "an ordinary particle inside an external potential will move towards the potential minimum , in the mean time gaining kinetic energy .",
    "a particle with negative effective mass , however , will move towards the potential maximum and in doing so , it looses kinetic energy .",
    "this process can not go on forever since there is only a finite amount of kinetic energy for the system to loose . in the process , the effective mass will eventually change from negative to positive .",
    "our study also demonstrates that , as an alternative to the established feshbach resonance method , changing the effective mass of a bose - einstein condensate provides us with an additional way to control the nonlinear atom - atom interaction in a condensate .",
    "this approach should be particularly useful for systems with no feshbach resonances at convenient magnetic field strengths , or when the presence of external magnetic fields is undesirable .",
    "controlling atom - atom interactions via their effective mass also provides the possibility to induce anisotropic nonlinear interactions , due to the tensorial character of the effective mass in higher dimensions .",
    "our study here focused on the dynamics of the system . in the future",
    ", it will also be interesting to study its static properties . for doing so",
    ", one needs to provide an additional confining potential .",
    "we must keep in mind that a confining potential for a negative effective mass state is an _ anti - trap _ , instead of a trap .",
    "this suggests the possibility of trapping strong - field - seeking states using the magnetic traps implemented in current bec experiments .",
