    "displacement , or detachment of ions , atoms or molecules from a bulk alkali halide crystal is generally an energetically costly process .",
    "for instance , the energy required to remove a nacl molecule from bulk nacl is @xmath01.8  ev per molecule  @xcite . nonetheless ,",
    "following addition or removal of an electron to the crystal , individual neutral atoms may be extracted from an alkali halide surface with greater ease . on account of the absence of coulomb binding , and of the resulting low stability of the surface neutralized atom , such a process will be energetically less expensive .    for the extraction of a neutral halogen atom",
    "there is the initial cost of the preliminary neutralization process , requiring roughly the exciton energy of nacl of order 8  ev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . once primed with this ( surface ) exciton the alkali halide solid is known to emit a halogen atom with creation of a surface f - center  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with stm tips on nacl(100 ) atomically thin films  @xcite showed in addition that it is feasible to extract halogen atoms under a tip without prior excitation but in conditions of applied voltage .    for the extraction of neutral na atoms",
    "the preliminary neutralization process is on the contrary exoenergetic , since an electron initially at the energy of vacuum zero can lower its energy by falling in the affinity level of the alkali halide surface , or of a defect , as will be discussed below .",
    "here we examine theoretically the emission of both neutral cl and na atoms upon subtraction or donation respectively of electrons to nacl cubic nanoclusters .",
    "experimentally , neutral nacl nanoclusters may acquire negative charge through electron attachment , or positive charge via electron photoemission  @xcite .",
    "early empirical estimates suggested the possible thermal emission of neutral na atoms from nacl nanoclusters with an activation energy as small as 0.4  ev . an even smaller energy of about 0.04  ev was estimated for the detachment of neutral cl atoms  @xcite .",
    "such low detachment energies are likeliest for the weakly bound atoms at the cluster corners .",
    "interestingly , since as mentioned above electron attachment to the nacl affinity level will itself liberate energy , this suggests the possibility to generate cheaply reactive alkali atoms whose availability might be of considerable importance for principle as well as for practical applications .    in this paper",
    "we use first principles density functional theory ( dft ) methods to calculate the energy necessary to detach a neutral corner alkali ( halogen ) atom after donation ( subtraction ) of an electron to an alkali halide crystalline nanocube .",
    "the calculated neutral na extraction energy is 0.60.7  ev , somewhat larger than , but of similar magnitude of , the semi - empirical estimates .",
    "the extraction energy obtained for neutral cl is about 0.8  ev , much larger than the empirical estimates . in the process",
    ", we independently clarify several aspects of nacl(100 ) surface electronic structure .",
    "carrying initially out our calculations for an infinite flat , fully relaxed nacl(100 ) surface , we first of all identify the surface electronic states , focusing on those that lie energetically inside the bulk energy gap .",
    "to a zero order approximation , these states foreshadow the wavefunctions which an added hole or an extra electron would occupy in a hypothetical fully delocalized , plane - wave like state when added to the infinite , perfect nacl(100 ) surface .",
    "thus these filled and empty surface qualitatively describe respectively the ideal ionization and affinity levels of the infinite nacl solid , when bounded by nacl(100 ) surfaces .",
    "actually however , a hole / electron initially created in such a surface state may not generally remain stable in such a plane - wave like , delocalized state . even in the absence of defects and of extrinsic traps ,",
    "electron - phonon coupling alone can lead to a spontaneous local deformation of the surface lattice structure , whereby the surface electron or hole may become localized , or `` self - trapped '' .",
    "a self - trapped hole near a cl@xmath1 surface ion , or a self - trapped electron near a na@xmath2 surface ion can lead to ion neutralization , canceling the electrostatic attraction which originally tied that ion to surface lattice .",
    "the surface atom thus neutralized will in that case remain bound to the surface only through weak induced - dipole and dispersion forces , now relatively easy to break .",
    "we will not actually pursue the existence of such ideal surface self - trapped states here .",
    "the reason for this is that in presence of such omnipresent surface defects as steps , kinks , or corners , the actual trapping of electrons and holes will take place right there , with great preference over possible self - trapping in the flat surface regions .    as a preliminary step",
    ", the physics and the energetics of electron / hole capture will be addressed in this paper by direct electronic structure calculations of initially neutral , then charged , nacl(100 ) nanocubes .",
    "the cubes are chosen with `` magic structures ''  @xcite of increasing size , namely ( nacl)@xmath3 ( nc4 ) and ( nacl)@xmath4 ( nc32 ) . following the charging of the nanocube , yielding nc4@xmath5 and nc32@xmath5 ,",
    "one corner atom , cl in the positive case , na in the negative case , is gradually and adiabatically forced to detach , by moving along a ( 111 ) direction away from the cube corner .",
    "the detaching cl and na atoms have captured the added hole or electron and are spontaneously neutral , while the cluster left behind has an ion vacancy and is charged .",
    "the increase of total energy upon detachment defines the energy barrier for neutral atom escape .",
    "we find that the results for the two cluster sizes , nc4 and nc32 essentially coincide , suggesting that size effects are negligible , so that the resulting calculated detachment energies can be trusted as a good approximation the cost of neutral corner atom extraction for arbitrary sizes , and probably even from corners of more general geometries .",
    "these results now permit a quantitative discussion of the overall energy balance of the neutral atom emission process and in particular the probability of direct thermal emission .",
    "in addition , we obtain as a byproduct a description of the atomic and electronic structure of the nacl(100 ) surface , and of the nanocube corner vacancies with their ionization and affinity levels , all of potential spectroscopic interest .",
    "we did not attempt to simulate the process of electron attachment or electron removal , since they are not relevant to our problem .",
    "actually , calculations of electron attachment to a nacl nanocluster already exist in the literature based on quantum path - integral molecular dynamics methods , using classical interatomic potentials , and by treating the quantum nature of the extra electron in an effective way  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : computational ] we will describe the computational method and the geometrical aspects of the systems that are the subject of our calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we will present and discuss the electronic structure for the neutral and charged nacl(100 ) surface , and subsequently that of the neutral and charged nanoclusters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we present the energetics of neutral atom emission processes , with an estimation of thermal emission rates .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] will present our conclusions .",
    "we carried out ab initio electronic structure and total energy calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "we adopted the plane wave pseudopotential approach  @xcite , using norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite and a plane wave cutoff of 40  ry .",
    "the na pseudopotential was generated from the ionized configuration ( @xmath6 ) and non - linear core corrections  @xcite were included .",
    "charged systems were simulated by adding one electron to the cluster lumo ( conduction band in the infinite surface case ) or subtracting one electron from the cluster homo ( valence band in the infinite surface case ) in presence of a uniform neutralizing background .",
    "surfaces and isolated nanocubes were simulated by periodically repeated slabs and nanocubes , all replicas well separated by a sufficient amount of vacuum .",
    "all calculations were spin polarized , and made use of the gradient - corrected pw91 exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "we started by computing the electronic structure , the equilibrium lattice spacing ( 5.62   ) and the bulk modulus ( 22  gpa ) of bulk _ fcc _ nacl , in good agreement with experimental values ( 5.54  and 28.6  gpa  @xcite ) and with previous calculations .",
    "the calculated dft energy gap is 5.42  ev , substantially smaller than the experimental gap 8.97  ev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we should point out that this defect , which is standard in dft calculations , does not cause errors or problems with the accuracy of the total energy , so long as the energetic ordering of levels is correct .",
    "thus for example the total energy calculation would develop problems if , say , the kohn sham @xmath7 electronic energy level of the neutral na atom were to fall accidentally outside the nacl cluster energy gap , for that would wrongly make the neutral atomic state unstable .",
    "we find no such occurrence in our calculations , which can therefore be relied upon to a state of the art dft accuracy .",
    "as the next step , we calculated the electronic structure , total energy and equilibrium atomic positions of neutral infinite nacl(100 ) surface .",
    "for that we used a slab consisting of 10 atomic layers , periodically repeated and separated by 8    of vacuum .",
    "sampling of two dimensional @xmath8-points was done by means of a monkhorst - pack mesh of 4@xmath94 in the 2d brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "surface electronic states were identified based on their energy location inside the surface projected bulk energy gap , and on their exponential decay from the surface towards the slab center .",
    "the zero of kohn - sham electronic eigenvalues is taken to be the vacuum level , initially extracted from the average value of the hartree potential in the geometric center of the vacuum region between the slabs , after a careful extrapolation to the infinite distance limit .",
    "cubic nacl nanocluster geometries were subsequently created by cutting out cubelets from a perfect nacl crystal , with an initial interatomic na  cl distance of 2.81   .",
    "we studied neutral nanocubes of two sizes , a small one na@xmath3cl@xmath3 made up of 8 atoms or 4 molecules ( nc4 ) , and a larger one na@xmath4cl@xmath4 of 64 atoms or 32 molecules ( nc32 ) .",
    "calculations were carried in a cubic supercell of 10    lateral side for the smaller cube and 20    for the larger one .",
    "we sampled the supercell bz at the @xmath10 point only .",
    "for the neutral nanocubes , we verified that the residual interaction between periodic replicas is negligible .",
    "however , for the charged cubes , the residual interaction is not negligible and was removed by the technique described in ref .",
    "we will begin this section by describing the electronic states of the infinite ideal neutral nacl(100 ) surface , followed by results for charged nacl(100 ) , where the extra electron and the extra hole are fully delocalized .",
    "subsequently we will present results for the neutral and charged nanocubes , and the calculated extraction energy curves .",
    "modeling the infinite flat nacl(100 ) surface with a 10-layer slab , its geometric structure was fully relaxed so as to minimize the calculated dft total energy .",
    "the largest relaxation occurred for the outer surface atoms , the na@xmath2 surface ions relaxing inwards , the cl@xmath1 surface ions outwards . as a result",
    "the electron charge distribution ( carried almost entirely by cl@xmath1 ions ) spills out further into the vacuum .",
    "overall , the zero temperature equilibrium neutral nacl(100 ) geometry is thus predicted to be slightly buckled , with a difference in height between cl@xmath1 surface ions and na@xmath2 surface ions of 0.095   .",
    "the computed surface energy is 13.17  mev / @xmath11 ( 211  erg / cm@xmath11 ) , in line with experimental estimates and in striking agreement with born - mayer - huggins - fumi - tosi classical potential calculations , which yield about 200  erg / cm@xmath11 at @xmath130 . ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the electronic states of the slab were plotted in the 2d surface bz , in superposition with the surface projected bulk bands .",
    "possible nacl(100 ) surface electronic states were then identified by their energetic location inside the surface projected bulk energy gap .",
    "our calculated surface electronic structure of the fully relaxed , neutral nacl(100 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfbands ] .",
    "the edge of the conduction band lies 1.02  ev below the vacuum level . below that",
    ", we find a pair of empty surface states , 1.35  ev and 1.46  ev below vacuum respectively .",
    "the wavefunction of these states mainly consists of surface na @xmath7 and @xmath14 orbitals spilling out into vacuum  strikingly unlike the conduction states of bulk nacl , which have instead a sizable cl @xmath14 character .",
    "qualitatively , these neutral surface states suggests electron affinity levels of nacl(100 ) of a very similar nature , namely surface na @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "their significance however is obvously not quantitative , because these states are not occupied by an actual electron .",
    "the experimentally reported electron affinities of nacl in fact range from 0.5  ev ( refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) to 1  ev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , roughly 35% to 70% of the calculated empty surface state energy value below vacuum zero .    by charging the slab with an extra electron",
    ", we attempted to compute the electron affinity as the total energy difference between the slab with an extra electron and the neutral slab @xmath15 .",
    "this should work in principle so long as the sequence of the electronic levels is preserved .",
    "however we found that within dft - pw91 , the extra electron level rises above the conduction band edge .",
    "as a results , the scf procedure does not converge .",
    "this we believe is an effect of the incomplete cancellation of self - interaction in dft , and thus an artifact , reflecting the well known difficulty that approximate xc functionals have in binding extra electrons  @xcite .",
    "due to that we do not have a reliable calculation of the surface electron affinity levels of nacl(100 ) , and all we can state is that they should lie between the empty surface state levels at 1.35  ev and 1.46  ev below vacuum , and vacuum zero .",
    "coming to the filled states , the surface projected valence band edge lies @xmath06.4  ev below vacuum .",
    "due to the dft underestimation of the energy gap , the true valence band edge actually lies @xmath09@xmath1610  ev below the vacuum level , as suggested by the experimental work function  @xcite . just above the calculated valence band edge",

    "<S> detachment of neutral cations / anions from solid alkali halides can in principle be provoked by donating / subtracting electrons to the surface of alkali halide crystals , but generally constitutes a very endothermic process . however , the amount of energy required for emission is smaller for atoms located in less favorable positions , such as surface steps and kinks . for a corner ion in an alkali halide cube </S>",
    "<S> the binding is the weakest , so it should be easier to remove that atom , once it is neutralized . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out first principles density functional calculations and simulations of neutral and charged nacl nanocubes , to establish the energetics of extraction of neutralized corner ions . </S>",
    "<S> following hole donation ( electron removal ) we find that detachment of neutral cl corner atoms will require a limited energy of about 0.8  ev . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , following the donation of an excess electron to the cube , a neutral na atom is extractable from the corner at the lower cost of about 0.6  ev . since the cube electron affinity level ( close to that a nacl(100 ) surface state , which we also determine ) is estimated to lie about 1.8  ev below vacuum , the overall energy balance upon donation to the nanocube of a zero energy electron from vacuum will be exothermic . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic and electronic structure of the nacl(100 ) surface , and of the nanocube na and cl corner vacancies are obtained and analyzed as a byproduct . </S>"
