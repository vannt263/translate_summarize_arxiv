    "the models involved , however , lack a geometric structure and hence can not describe the spatial evolution of real colloidal glass formers . about a decade ago latz @xcite attempted to extend the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the ideal glass transition @xcite to describe the irreversible relaxation , including aging processes , of a suddenly quenched glass forming system .",

    "[ fig3].a we can compare the non - equilibrium arrested structure factor @xmath201 with the equilibrium structure @xmath194 that would have been attained if no dynamic arrest condition had appeared along the equilibration process of @xmath163 .    in the same figure",
    "we also illustrate the evolution of @xmath163 towards its asymptotic limit @xmath201 with a series of snapshots corresponding to a set of increasing waiting times .",
    "the most interesting feature revealed by these snapshots is the existence of an early evolution regime , in which @xmath163 evolves rather quickly towards the close neighborhood of @xmath201 .",
    "as illustrated by these snapshots , this occurs within a finite waiting time @xmath202 .",
    "this early regime is followed by an asymptotic long-@xmath164 regime , in which the evolution of @xmath163 to actually reach the exact asymptotic value @xmath201 becomes extremely slow and completely imperceptible in the scale of the figure .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , where we plot the evolution of the position @xmath196 of the low-@xmath167 peak of @xmath163 for various waiting times between the last two snapshots of the main figure ( i.e. , @xmath203 ) .",
    "we notice that in this regime the last few data for @xmath196 may be fitted approximately by a power law @xmath204 .",
    "in fact , the crossover waiting time @xmath205 can be estimated more accurately by the condition @xmath206 , with @xmath207 being the asymptotic value of @xmath196 corresponding to @xmath201 .",
    "this yields @xmath208 .",
    "the slow evolution regime @xmath209 , corresponding to asymptotically long times , can not be observed , by definition , in the structural evolution illustrated in fig .",
    "it can , however , be observed in the evolution of the dynamic properties , as we discuss below .",
    "let us emphasize the difference between the two quench processes just discussed ( i.e. , those involving the final state @xmath153 or @xmath154 ) .",
    "for this , fig .",
    "[ fig3].b plots the evolution of @xmath176 for the latter process in the same manner as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] does for the former .",
    "let us point out that the quench simulated by foffi et al .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the conditions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , i.e. , to the process ending in the state @xmath154 just below the dynamic arrest line .",
    "we recall that in the process illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] nothing prevents the evolution of @xmath176 from reaching the final structure factor @xmath194 , and this leads to the upturn of the peak illustrated in the inset of that figure .",
    "in contrast , as observed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3].b , the main difference is that now the main peak of @xmath176 decreases but seems to stop evolving when @xmath210 reaches @xmath211 , and this happens to occur before the upturn of the peak towards @xmath197 has a chance to develop .",
    "this is in agreement with what is observed in the simulated quench of foffi et al .",
    ", in which the main peak only decreases without exhibiting any upturn . on the other hand , our results in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3].b also predict that the peak shifts slightly to the right , but in the simulation results such a shift is not appreciable .    similarly , in the report of the simulated quench of foffi et al .",
    "@xcite no reference is made to the low-@xmath167 peak predicted by our theory according to the illustrative results in fig [ fig3].a .",
    "thus , at this stage we can not make a definitive statement on the level of a fine quantitative comparison between our theoretical predictions and the simulation results for the evolution of @xmath176 , partially because of the differences in the model and in the conditions ( volume fraction , for example ) in which the quench was performed . while it is clearly desirable to carry out a systematic comparison on identical conditions , the agreement with important features observed in the simulation experiments is encouraging .     on correlation time @xmath19 for the quench to the final state @xmath154 corresponding to the waiting times @xmath212 and @xmath188 ( @xmath213 ) . in inset (",
    "a ) and in the main figure the correlation time is scaled , respectively , by @xmath214 and by the relaxation time @xmath215 of the stretched exponential fit of the final relaxation of @xmath216 .",
    "inset ( b ) plots @xmath215 as a function of waiting time , with the line being the fit @xmath217 ( both times in units of @xmath214 ) . ]",
    "let us conclude this exercise by showing the irreversible evolution of the @xmath19-dependence of the intermediate scattering function @xmath218 for the quenching process @xmath219 .",
    "this is presented in inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the correlator @xmath220 is plotted as a function of the correlation time @xmath19 at representative waiting times corresponding to the snapshots of @xmath176 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , namely , @xmath212 and @xmath188 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "these results illustrate the fact that the decay of the temporal correlation of the fluctuations slows down notoriously as the system ages , developing a two - step relaxation : the initial @xmath221-relaxation to an increasingly better defined plateau , followed by the @xmath222-relaxation from this plateau .",
    "this is a typical behavior observed in the simulation and experimental studies of aging @xcite .",
    "another feature associated with aging is the superposition of the alpha relaxation at different waiting times on a single master curve , well - fitted by a stretched exponential function @xmath223 $ ] .",
    "our theoretical results also exhibit this scaling property , as demonstrated in the main panel of fig .",
    "the exponent @xmath221 is independent of @xmath164 ( although it may depend on @xmath167 ) . for the case illustrated in the figure we find @xmath224 .",
    "the @xmath222-relaxation time @xmath215 does depend on @xmath167 and on @xmath164 , and the values of @xmath215 corresponding to each waiting time @xmath164 are plotted in the inset ( b ) of the same figure . at short times , these values are well fitted by a power law @xmath225 characterized by the exponent @xmath226 . in the simulation experiment of foffi et al .",
    "@xcite this scaling of the correlator is not fully apparent , although  in a crude tentative of data scaling \" , the authors report an exponent @xmath227 . at this point we should mention that , beyond detailed quantitative issues , the general predicted scenario illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is completely similar to that reported in the simulated experiment of foffi et al .",
    "@xcite , which , in its turn , was found to be similar to that observed experimentally by pham et al",
    ". @xcite .    regarding the low-@xmath167 peak predicted by our theory ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) , let us notice that , although the final temperature of the quench is still above the spinodal temperature for this isochore , the asymptotic approach of @xmath176 to the non - equilibrium structure @xmath201 is strongly suggestive of some form of _ arrested _ spinodal decomposition .",
    "in fact , preliminary calculations using our theory indicate that the scenario described in the main panel and the inset of our fig . [ fig3].a above , regarding this low-@xmath167 peak and the phenomenon of arrested spinodal decomposition ,",
    "is also predicted to occur at lower concentrations , in qualitative agreement with experimental observations ( see fig . 4.b and 4.c of lu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . further comparisons and analysis lie , however , outside the scope of this illustrative presentation of the possible applications of the non - equilibrium scgle theory to the description of dynamic arrest phenomena , including aging , in instantaneously quenched uniform systems .",
    "in this manner , in section [ seciii ] we have illustrated with a number of quantitative predictions for a specific model system ( involving hard sphere plus short - ranged attractive interactions ) the predictive nature of a generic theory of the non - equilibrium irreversible evolution of the state of a homogeneous system subjected to a homogeneous and instantaneous quenching process .",

    "the specific process discussed corresponds to the sudden isochoric quench from an initial fluid state @xmath157 to a final state near the  attractive glass \" transition .",
    "we observed that if the final state is also ergodic , the structure relaxes to its value equilibrium value @xmath166 , whereas if the final state is in the dynamically arrested state , the structure saturates asymptotically to a non - equilibrium value @xmath229 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath163 develops a non - equilibrium low-@xmath167 peak that indicates the appearance of spatial heterogeneities of average size @xmath230 , with @xmath184 being the position of this emerging low-@xmath167 maximum .",
    "the emergence of this peak is associated with the vicinity of the gas - liquid spinodal region . regarding the evolution of the dynamics with aging time",
    ", the theory predicts that the intermediate scattering function @xmath231 develops a two - step relaxations as the system ages .",
    "the theory also predicts the superposition of the alpha relaxation at different waiting times on a single master curve , well - fitted by a stretched exponential function , as observed in the simulation and experimental studies of aging .",

    "@xcite , and summarized in sec .",
