    "is seen to be equivalent to setting the vacuum expectation value of @xmath23 to @xmath24 due to the presence of commutator term in the action ( [ loweff ] ) , vacuum expectation value of @xmath23 will give rise to a non - standard kinetic term .",

    "the field @xmath27 acquires a non - trivial boundary condition as it goes around the circle .",
    "@xmath32    now we can understand the spectrum and the vacuum structure in the matter sector .",
    "let us expand the matter hypermultiplet into components of @xmath9 adjoint representations @xmath33 in terms of these components , the boundary condition reads @xmath34 @xmath35 that is , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are periodic and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are antiperiodic .",

    ", the vacuum expectation value of @xmath23 becomes @xmath42 turning on the vacuum expectation value of @xmath37 then corresponds to separating a pair of singly wound d - string .",
    "the gauge group @xmath9 is broken to @xmath43 subgroup which corresponds to gauge fields living on each of the branes .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of these @xmath44 gauge field can be read off from the diagonal of ( [ hol ] ) .",
    "these vacuum expectation values specifies a unique superposition of fundamental winding states bound to the d - branes as was described in @xcite .",
    "this also provides a concrete physical picture for the higgsing of the fractional states .",
    "the fractional states corresponds to strings stretched between the two wound d - strings with the above @xmath44 expectation values .",
    "they become light when the two d - strings coincide . the fact that these states are fractional can be most easily seen by t - dualizing along the @xmath8 direction . under t - duality , the period of the cycle is inverted and a d - string becomes a zero brane .",
    "since @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dual period , this configuration corresponds to that of a two zero branes separated by half a period @xcite ( see figure [ figb ] ) .",
    "this was anticipated in @xcite but here we derived it directly using the low energy effective description of the d - brane .",
    "the open string stretching from one zero brane to the other must then wrap around the cycle by half integral multiple of the period .",
    "t - dualizing back to a d - string picture , we find that the momentum of these states are half integrally moded , which is precisely what we expect for the fractional strings .",

    "this is precisely the expected world sheet description of string states which stretches between two 0-branes separated by distance @xmath61 .",
    "now let us examine the stringy dynamics of these fractional winding states . to this end",
    "we must construct vertex operators for these states and compute their correlation function .",
    "an essential ingredient in such a vertex operator is the piece which encodes the fact that the string is stretched between separated d - branes .",

    "now the basic construction of the vertex operator for the fractional string state is clear .",
    "world sheet supersymmetry constrains the form of the vertex operator to take the conventional form @xmath82 but the boundary condition shifts the winding number @xmath83 to take on half - integral values .",
    "so we see how fractional string spectrum arises from the world sheet considerations .",
    "these vertex operators can be used to compute amplitudes involving fractional strings .",
    "perhaps the simplest such amplitude is a process where a macroscopic string @xcite in a ground state of winding number @xmath84 with momentum @xmath85 is absorbed by one of the zero branes , creating a pair of fractionally wound open string states with winding numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "( see figure [ figc ] . )",
    "the amplitude takes the general form @xmath88 where @xmath89 for fractional strings and @xmath90 for the macroscopic string with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is precisely of the form of the amplitude computed in @xcite so we simply quote the result @xmath93 where @xmath94 with the requirement that @xmath86 and @xmath87 take on half - integer values .",
    "of course , by t - duality , this amplitude is exactly equivalent to the amplitude for a process where a graviton of momentum @xmath81 is absorbed by a doubly wound d - string creating a pair of fractional momentum open strings with momentum @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "until this point we have focused on fractional excitations of d - string wound exactly twice . the basic structure underlying",

    "this structure has a natural generalization to configurations with higher winding numbers .",
    "the low - energy effective theory for the @xmath4-tuply wound d - string configuration is a @xmath100 gauge theory with the holonomy @xmath101 twisting of the boundary is induced by the phase factor given by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath102.\\ ] ] it turns out that for all @xmath4 , the spectrum of eigenvalues is precisely the @xmath4-fold degenerate spectrum of @xmath103 which implies a combined spectrum quantized in units of @xmath104 .    to see that the spectrum of @xmath105 is indeed of the form ( [ spectrum ] ) , simply note that adjoint representation of @xmath100 is a tensor product @xmath106 .",
    "natural basis for the fundamental representation of @xmath100 in this context the eigenvectors @xmath107 of the holonomy matrix @xmath108 with eigenvalues @xmath109 .",
    "an adjoint element @xmath110 transforms under @xmath108 like @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 takes integer values between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "now , @xmath116 is an @xmath4-fold degenerate set of integers ranging from 0 to @xmath115 .",
    "perhaps an example would suffice to make this point . for @xmath117",
    ", @xmath118 takes on values @xmath119 as is expected .",
    "we can generalize these ideas further to fractional states in the dirichlet - neumann ( dn ) sector .",
    "dn strings appear when branes of different dimensionality , say a 1-brane and a 5-brane , are simultaneously present .",
    "the 1-brane 5-brane system compactified on @xmath120 is by now familiar as a model of extremal black hole with a regular horizon @xcite .",
    "when the 5-brane wraps around @xmath120 , it is possible in principle to turn on non - trivial holonomies for all cycles . here , we will restrict our attention to the simple case where the only non - trivial holonomy is along the direction parallel to the 1-brane .",
    "this is essentially the case considered in @xcite .",
    "now consider a 1-brane wrapped @xmath0 times and a 5-brane wrapped @xmath1 times around the cycle in @xmath8 direction .",
    "this corresponds to turning on a holonomy matrix @xmath121 of @xmath122 and @xmath123 of @xmath124 of the type ( [ genhol ] ) .",
    "the dn - strings carries a chan - patton factor @xmath125 which transforms as @xmath126 and computing the extent of twist in the boundary condition reduces to computing the eigenvalue of @xmath127.\\ ] ] just as in the previous case , it is convenient to construct the basis @xmath125 using the tensor product of @xmath107 and @xmath128 where @xmath107 is an eigenvector of @xmath121 with eigenvalues @xmath129 and @xmath130 is an eigenvector of @xmath123 with eigenvalues @xmath131 .",
    "then @xmath132 just as in the previous case , let us make a table of @xmath133 for @xmath0 = 2 and @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 we see that @xmath136 takes on integer values between 0 and @xmath137 with no degeneracy",
    ". this will be true in general for @xmath0 and @xmath1 relatively prime , implying that the spectrum of these states will be quantized in units of @xmath138 which is precisely what was anticipated in @xcite .",
    "( in general , the spectrum will be quantized in units of @xmath139 with degeneracy @xmath20 where @xmath20 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . )",
    "perturbative dynamics of fractional dn - strings can then be computed along the lines of @xcite .",
    "in this article we considered the excitations on d - branes wrapped multiple times by turning on a background with a non - trivial gauge holonomy . we find a spectrum of states quantized in fractional units of momentum along the compactified direction .",
    "these are the so - called `` fractional strings '' whose existence have been postulated previously on the grounds of entropy counting and s - duality .",
    "we have provided an explicit check on this postulate by constructing these states in the d - brane formulation .    in the low - energy effective theory ,",
    "gauge holonomies have the effect of twisting the boundary condition .",
    "fractional states arises naturally as a result of twisted boundary conditions .",
    "same basic conclusion can be drawn by considering the full open - string theory in the world sheet formulation . here , it was convenient to consider the t - dual of multiply wound d - string which corresponded to @xmath4 d0-branes equally spaced along the circle of compactification .",
    "the fractional momentum states have a natural interpretation in the t - dual picture as strings stretching between these d0-branes which winds around the period of compactification in fractional units .",
    "vertex operators for these twisted strings were constructed with which we computed the hawking emission / absorption amplitude .    finally , we described how the same idea can be used to explain the fractional spectrum of dn - strings .",
    "for example , it is possible to show that the momentum of dn - strings in a 1-brane 5-brane system with winding numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 are quantized in units of @xmath138 .",
    "this has been anticipated in @xcite but it is pleasant to find an explicit d - brane construction .    recent exciting work on string dualities has predicted the existence of exactly one threshold bound state @xcite in the quantum mechanics of these d - branes @xcite . by construction , our discussion of fractional strings is perturbative , and at leading order captures only the semi - classical aspects of d - brane dynamics .",
    "presumably , the full quantum dynamics of d - branes such as the existence of these bound states is encoded in the full re - summation of scattering amplitudes , but it is not clear how this is done in detail . perhaps something can be learned by examining the large order growth @xcite of the perturbative expansion .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand how perturbation theory and d - brane quantum mechanics fit together in the full treatment of non - perturbative string dynamics .",
    "in particular , we have shown in this article that the semi - classical configuration of a d - string wound @xmath4 times on period @xmath5 is t - dual to d0-branes equally spaced along the dual period @xmath46 .",
    "recently , it was argued on the grounds of s - duality that the threshold bound state approximates this semi - classical configuration in the limit where period @xmath46 is small @xcite .",
    "something interesting appears to be happening when @xmath46 is taken small enough to squeeze the 0-brane bound state wave function to a size smaller than its natural scale .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand this phenomenon in detail by studying the dynamics of d0-branes along the lines of @xcite but on a compactified space .",
