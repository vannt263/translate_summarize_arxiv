    "hohenberg - kohn - sham(hks ) density functional theory(dft ) @xcite has been most widely used to investigate the electronic structures of many - electron systems .",
    "it is a theory for dealing with the ground states and their properties @xcite .",
    "applications of the hohenberg - kohn theorem and the kohn - sham construction is limited to the ground - state because it is the ground - state density of an electronic system that determines the hamiltonian , and consequently other physical observables of the electronic system .",
    "this suggests both the ground as well as excited - state properties can be determined from the ground - state density through the hamiltonian operator since it characterizes all the states of a system . on the other hand , to develop an excited - state dft akin to it s ground - state counterpart , it is important to describe an excited - state of a system in terms of the density of that state . almost for the last two and",
    "half decade researchers have investigated @xcite the possibility of giving a formal foundation to the time - independent excited - state dft like the hks dft does for the ground - states , but it is yet to come to its full fruition .",
    "+ to make the excited - state calculations feasible within the density functional formalism there are two open questions to be answered : ( i ) does there exist a mapping between the excited - state density and the external potential like the ground - states ?",
    "( ii ) secondly , for the determination of the excited- state energies , is it possible to construct reasonably accurate exchange - correlation energy functionals ?",
    "we note that although the exact form of the exchange - correlation functional is unknown for the ground - states , there are several accurate and approximate functionals @xcitein traditional dft .",
    "the issue is to find such approximate functionals for the excited - states . the second question is partly answered through an attempt made by the present authors@xcite in the recent past by developing an exchange energy functional within the local - density approximation(lda ) for a particular class of excited - states",
    "this suggests that a correlation functional can also be developed in a similar fashion .",
    "+ we now address the first question which is the main focus of the present study .",
    "over the past few years , a lot of attention has been paid to the question of mapping @xcite from an excited - state density @xmath0 to the external potential @xmath1 , because the entire structure of time - independent excited - state dft depends on that .",
    "a brief account of this is as follows : + the first step in establishing a mapping from an excited - state density to a many electron wavefunction is taken by looking for @xmath2-stationary states @xcite .",
    "these are states @xmath3 that reproduce a given density @xmath4(density of the @xmath5- excited - state ) and simultaneously make the expectation value latexmath:[$\\left<\\psi|\\hat t + \\hat v_{ee }    @xmath2-stationary states and thus establishing a mapping requires an additional input .",
    "levy and nagy @xcite provide this by requiring that @xmath3 be orthogonal to @xmath7 , which are to be determined by the ground - state density @xmath8 for the system under study .",
    "thus the knowledge of the ground - state density is essential to define a map @xmath9 .",
    "this is reasonable because it is the ground - state density that really fixes the hamiltonian of a system uniquely .",
    "levy and nagy then go on to construct a kohn - sham system of non - interacting electrons whose @xmath10 excited - state produces the given excited - state density .",
    "further they put forth a criterion that the ground - state density of the kohn - sham system is closest to the true ground state density of the system in the least square sense .",
    "+ we have been studying the mapping from an excited - state density to the potential and have been investigating the levy - nagy criterion for constructing the kohn - sham system for excited - states .",
    "our work in this direction forms the content of this paper .",
    "we show : +",
    "( i ) an explicit construction of the external potential from an excited - state density using grling s approach @xcite , + ( ii ) that the levy - nagy criterion @xcite of constructing the kohn - sham system is not perfect .",
    "we give reasons for it , + ( iii ) that for a given state the kohn - sham system should be constructed by comparison of the kinetic energies of the true and the non - interacting systems .",
    "we start with grling s formulation @xcite of the excited - state problem .",
    "the formulation is based on the constrained - search approach @xcite and provides a map from an excited - state density to a many - body wavefunction . for a given excited - state density @xmath0 a @xmath11stationary state @xmath12",
    "is given by making the expectation value @xmath13 stationary with the constraint that the many - particle wavefunction @xmath12 giving the same density @xmath0 .",
    "corresponding to each @xmath11stationary state @xmath12 there is an external potential @xmath1 .",
    "this has been shown by grling .",
    "we give a different proof of it here , with the external potential @xmath1 arising as the lagrange multiplier to ensure the constraint of producing the density @xmath0 .",
    "a @xmath11stationary wavefunction @xmath3 gives , by the stationarity principle @xmath14 with the constraint that @xmath15 writting eq .  1 in expanded form",
    ", we get @xmath16 because of condition ( eq .  2 ) above this will be satisfied if @xmath17    thus in general @xmath11stationarity of @xmath3 implies that it satisfies @xmath18    however , since @xmath19 are symmetric operators and @xmath20 is antisymmetric , it s necessary @xmath21 must also be symmetric .",
    "thus all @xmath22 s must be the same function @xmath23 . identifying this function as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , we get @xmath3 satisfying @xmath26 we note that for different @xmath11stationary states @xmath1 will be different .",
    "thus by applying the constrained search method we get many @xmath11stationary states and the corresponding external potentials .",
    "the question is which one of these corresponds to a given system .",
    "levy and nagy identify @xcite this system as the one where @xmath3 is orthogonal to @xmath27 for a given ground - state density @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the levy - nagy theory @xcite , the wavefunction @xmath28 $ ] is a bi - functional of @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "one subtle point about the levy - nagy theory is that if the search for @xmath3 is restricted to the space orthogonal to @xmath27 , the variational principle becomes a minimum principle .",
    "the prescription above also makes the functional @xmath29 \\ ; = \\ ; \\raisebox{-1.6ex}{$\\stackrel{\\displaystyle{\\text{min } } } { \\scriptstyle{\\psi \\rightarrow \\boldsymbol{\\rho}({\\bf r } ) } } $ } \\langle \\psi | \\hat{t } \\;+\\ ; \\hat{v}_{ee } |\\psi \\rangle $ ] a bi - functional of the excited - state density @xmath0 as well as the ground - state density @xmath30 .",
    "+     state of @xmath31 generated for the original and one alternative configuration.,width=480,height=316 ]    next we discuss how a kohn - sham(ks ) system can be realized for an excited - state density . to get a ks system , the mapping from a given excited - state density to a non - interacting wavefunction",
    "is established by making the expectation value @xmath32 stationary with respect to variations in @xmath33 with @xmath33 giving the excited - state density .",
    "how this is done is described later .",
    "as is the case for the interacting systems , there may be several @xmath33 s and the corresponding ks potentials @xmath34 that give rise to an excited - state density and make @xmath32 stationary .",
    "two such potentials for the density of @xmath35 of @xmath31 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the excited - state density used is obtained by solving the excited - state ks equation with the harbola - sahni(hs ) @xcite exchange - only potential .",
    "the question that arises again is how do we choose one particular ks system to represent a system in its excited - state .",
    "an intuitive way would be by comparing the ground - state densities , as was done for the interacting systems .",
    "however , the ground - state density of a non - interacting system that reproduces an excited - state density may not be the same as that of the true system ( it will be the same only if the electron - electron interaction were absent ) .",
    "thus levy and nagy propose @xcite that of the many fermionic non - interacting systems that give the same excited - state density , the one whose ground - state density resembles the exact one in the least square sense be identified as the kohn - sham system .",
    "the criterion is obviously exact @xcite for systems with no electron - electron interaction , as stated above . for interacting - electron systems ,",
    "the criterion appears to give @xcite the true kohn - sham system , consistent with the orbitals to which the electrons have been excited , as we discuss below .",
    "we have been investigating the levy - nagy criterion for many different excited - states of atomic systems .",
    "we find that whereas the criterion is satisfied for a large number of excited - states , there are exceptions also .",
    "we present and discuss these results below .",
    "the results are obtained as follows .",
    "working within the central field approximation , we perform the excited - state calculations using the exchange - only hs method and obtain the excited - state density ( kli - opm @xcite gives similar results ) .",
    "we then use the zhao - morrison - parr(zmp ) method @xcite to generate the same density with different configurations and test the levy - nagy criterion for these configurations . in the zmp method the kohn - sham system for a given density @xmath0 and a configuration of choice @xcite is obtained by solving the equation @xmath36}{|\\vec r - \\vec r\\prime| } d\\vec r\\prime \\right\\ } \\phi_i(\\vec r )   = \\varepsilon_i\\phi_i(\\vec r)\\ ] ] in the limit of @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 are the occupation numbers of the orbitals according to the configuration chosen .",
    "we choose @xmath39 large enough so that not only do the densities match to a high degree of accuracy , the highest occupied eigenvalues @xmath40 of",
    "the above equation also matches with the original @xmath40 to within @xmath41 ; in fact it is better than within @xmath42 in many of the cases .",
    "for example , for the @xmath43 excited - state of @xmath31 , we have generated the same density with three other configurations : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath40 and the expectation values @xmath46 and @xmath47 for different configurations are compared in table  i. to judge the numerical accuracy of our zmp program , we also generate the excited - state density with the original configuration and compare numbers obtained with the original numbers .",
    "we see that with the original configuration , the @xmath40 comes to within @xmath42 of the original value with @xmath48 whereas the various expectation values are essentially exact . for the three alternative configurations , the accuracy of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is about the same but the @xmath40 values differ slightly more depending on the configuration .",
    "the worst case is the @xmath45 for which @xmath49 for @xmath50 . to make sure that the eigenvalue will eventually converge to @xmath51 , we performed calculations for different values of @xmath39 for this configuration and found that @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , thereby shifting towards the true eigenvalue albeit very slowly .",
    "we also mention that for the configuration @xmath56 , the uppermost orbital is @xmath57 and not @xmath58 . the local potential in which the electrons are move is then given as : @xmath59 of this potential by occupying the lowest energy orbitals with the given number of electrons .",
    "we calculate its mean square distance from the true ground - state density @xmath30 as @xcite @xmath60 =   \\int_\\infty\\left\\{{\\rho_0(\\bf r ) } - \\tilde{\\rho}_0{(\\bf r)}\\right\\}^2 { \\rm d}^3 r \\;.\\ ] ] by the true ground - state density here , we mean the ground - state density obtained with the harbola - sahni exchange potential .",
    "the results for @xmath61 for a number of atoms and their excited - states are shown in tables  ii @xmath62 iii .",
    "the original configuration of the excited - sates is shown in the second column .",
    "the third column shows the alternative configurations using which we obtain the same density and the fourth column the corresponding @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "it is seen from the results that for most of the cases @xmath61 is the smallest for the original configuration but there are cases where @xmath61 is smallest for a different configuration . for example",
    ", there is the excited - state @xmath43 of @xmath31 for which the configuration @xmath45 gives the smallest @xmath61 .",
    "similarly for the state @xmath64 of @xmath65 , @xmath66 of @xmath67 and @xmath43 of @xmath68 , @xmath43 of @xmath69 @xmath61 is the smallest for a configuration other than the original configuration of the system .",
    "thus we find that the levy - nagy criterion , as quantified by eq .",
    "8 above , is not satisfactory in that it leads to a ks system where an excited - state configuration is not consistent with the original system .",
    "having found that the levy - nagy criterion is not fully satisfactory to identify a ks system , we have looked for other ways of doing so , remaining within the levy - nagy proposal of comparing the ground - state densities .",
    "thus instead of comparing densities directly , we compare them energetically as follows . after obtaining many different non - interacting systems for an excited - state density ,",
    "we take their ground - states and calculate the expectation value of the true ground - state kohn - sham hamiltonian(constructed using the hs exchange potential ) with respect to these ground - states .",
    "thus the calculation proceeds as follows : we solve the hs equation for the ground - state of a system and obtain the ground - state kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath70 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath71 with respect to the true ground - state orbitals is designated as @xmath72 ; it is the sum of the eigenvalues of the ground - state orbitals .",
    "next we take the different non - interacting systems giving an excited - state density , consider their ground - states and calculate the expectation value @xmath73 with respect to these states . because of the variational principle @xmath73 should always be above @xmath72 .",
    "we then identify the true ks system as that for which @xmath73 is closest to @xmath72 .",
    "this comparison is made in tables  iv @xmath62 v for the same systems as in tables  ii and iii with hs density .",
    "as is clear from the table the alternate criterion is better in that the correspondence between the original system and the kohn - sham system is restored for @xmath65,@xmath67 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , new inconsistencies arise in @xmath74,@xmath75 and @xmath76 although in these cases the difference in the numbers for the original and the alternative configuration is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "the inconsistency in @xmath31 and @xmath68 remains .",
    "we note that this criterion is very sensitive to the exchange potential .",
    "if calculations are done with kli - opm exchange potential , the inconsistency remains only in @xmath31 and @xmath68 systems .",
    "it is clear from the discussion in the two sections above that a criterion based on comparison of ground - state densities of excited - state kohn - sham systems can not be satisfactory .",
    "given the background above , we now present a consistent theory of excited - states within the rubric of density - functional approach .",
    "the principal tenets of the theory are :    ( * i * ) there is a straightforward way of mapping an excited - state density @xmath0 to the corresponding many - electron wavefunction @xmath12 or the external potential @xmath1 using the @xmath2-stationary wavefunctions .",
    "the wavefunction depends upon the ground - state density @xmath8 implicitly .",
    "( * ii * ) the kohn - sham system is defined through a comparison of the kinetic energy for the excited - states .",
    "this avoids any comparison of the ground - state densities which , as seen above , does nt give a satisfactory way of defining a ks system .",
    "we now discuss these two points one by one .    to describe the mapping from an excited - state density @xmath77 to a many - body wavefunction , we take recourse to the constrained - search approach .",
    "this gives , as discussed earlier , many different wavefunctions @xmath78 and the corresponding external potential @xmath79 .",
    "if in addition to the excited - state density we also know the ground - state density @xmath8 then @xmath1 is uniquely determined by the hohenberg - kohn @xcite theorem .",
    "thus with the knowledge of @xmath8 it is quite straightforward to select a particular @xmath3 that belongs to a @xmath80 $ ] combination by comparing @xmath79 with @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , we can think of it as finding @xmath3 variationally for a @xmath81 $ ] combination because the knowledge of @xmath8 and @xmath82 is equivalent . through the constrained search above a functional @xmath83 \\ ; = \\ ; \\langle \\psi[\\rho;\\rho_{0 } ] | \\hat{t } \\;+\\ ; \\hat{v}_{ee } | \\psi[\\rho;\\rho_{0}]\\rangle   \\label{constrained_search}\\ ] ] is also defined .",
    "the prescription above is similar to that of levy and nagy @xcite but avoids the orthogonality condition imposed by them .",
    "+ the densities for different excited state for a given ground - state density @xmath8 or external potential @xmath82 can thus be found as follows : take a density and search for @xmath3 that makes @xmath84 stationary ; check whether the corresponding @xmath82 matches with the given @xmath8(or @xmath82 ) ; if not , take another density and repeat the procedure until the correct @xmath2 is found . also because of the proof given in section ii above , the euler equation for the excited - state density is @xmath85}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r ) } + v_{ext}(\\vec r ) = \\mu\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the lagrange multiplier to ensure that @xmath77 integrates to the proper number of electrons .",
    "the prescription above for the excited - states in terms of their densities is quite straightforward , particularly because it s development is parallel to that for the ground - states . on the other hand , to construct a kohn - sham @xcite system for a given density is non - trivial ; and to carry out accurate calculations for excited- states it is of prime importance to construct a ks system .",
    "further , a ks system will be meaningful if the orbitals involved in an excitation match with the corresponding excitations in the true system .",
    "we have shown above that the kohn - sham system constructed using the levy - nagy criterion fails in this regard .    in principle , obtaining a kohn - sham system is quite easy .",
    "define the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath87 $ ] and use it to further define the exchange - correlation functional as @xmath88 = f\\left[\\rho,\\rho_0\\right ] - \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec r)\\rho(\\vec r\\prime)}{|\\vec r - \\vec r\\prime| } d\\vec r d\\vec r\\prime   - t_s\\left[\\rho,\\rho_0\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] then the euler equation for the excited - state densities will read @xmath89}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r ) } + \\int\\frac{\\rho(\\vec r\\prime)}{|\\vec r - \\vec r\\prime| } d\\vec r\\prime + \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}\\left[\\rho,\\rho_0\\right]}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r ) } + v_{ext } = \\mu\\;.\\ ] ] which is equivalent to solving @xmath90 with @xmath91}{\\delta\\rho(\\vec r)}\\;.\\ ] ] however , it is defining @xmath87 $ ] that is not easy in the excited - state problem .",
    "for the ground - states , @xmath92 $ ] is easily defined as the minimum kinetic energy for a given density obtained by occupying the lowest energy orbitals for a non - interacting system . on the other hand , for the excited - states it is not clear which orbitals to occupy for a given density , particularly because a density can be generated by many different non - interacting systems .",
    "levy - nagy select one of these systems by comparing the ground - state density of the excited - state non - interacting system with the true ground - state density . however , this criterion is not satisfactory as discussed earlier .",
    "therefore some other criterion has to be evolved to construct the excited - state kohn - sham system .",
    "+ before searching for other ways of constructing a kohn - sham system , we look for reasons that may be responsible for the levy - nagy criterion not being fully satisfactory .",
    "we argue that we are not being consistent while comparing the ground - state density of an excited - state ks system with the true ground - state density .",
    "this is because the ground - state density of the excited - state ks system is not the self - consistent ground - state density of the @xmath1 obtained for the excited - state density but of a potential different from @xmath1 . in comparing the ground - state densities",
    ", we are thus not comparing the @xmath1 of the excited - state ks system with the true @xmath1 , and this at times leads to inconsistent results . +",
    "in light of the above remarks , it is important that in constructing the kohn - sham system only the self - consistently determined quantities corresponding to a given excited - state density be compared .",
    "thus we propose that the ks system be so chosen that it is energetically very close to the original system . to ensure this",
    ", we define the ks system as that system for which the non - interacting kinetic energy , obtained through constrained search over the non - interacting wavefunctions , is closest to @xmath93 $ ] , already obtained through the full constrained search .",
    "this then gives the functional @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath94 $ ] is defined as the kinetic energy that is closest to the true kinetic energy @xmath93 $ ] obtained for a given excited - state density @xmath2 . defining @xmath87",
    "$ ] in this manner also keeps the dft exchange - correlation energy close to the conventional quantum mechanical exchange - correlation energy .",
    "an added advantage of keeping the difference between the two kinetic energies @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] smallest is that the structure of the kohn - sham potential is simple ; it is known that contribution of @xmath95 gives more structure to the ks potential .",
    "+ all the statements in this paragraph are justified on the basis of the differential virial theorem @xcite . using this theorem the exchange - correlation potential for a given density and the corresponding many body wavefunction @xmath3",
    "can be written as @xmath96 ) -   \\vec z(\\vec r;\\left[{\\gamma_1}\\right ] ) + \\int\\left [ \\nabla u(\\vec r,\\vec r\\prime)\\right ]   \\left [ \\rho(\\vec r)\\rho(\\vec r\\prime ) - 2\\gamma_2(\\vec r,\\vec r\\prime)\\right]d\\vec r\\prime \\right\\}}{\\rho(\\vec r)}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the first(second ) order density matrix and the vector fields @xmath98 are related to the true and kohn - sham kinetic energy density tensors respectively . for a given @xmath99 $ ] , @xmath100 are fixed and different configurations chosen give different @xmath101 .",
    "these different configurations can be thought of as arising from a different external potential ( as is shown below ) or from a different exchange - correlation potential @xcite . in any case kinetic energy difference between the true and kohn - sham system",

    "we now demonstrate the ideas presented above with examples .",
    "since we do not know how to perform the general constrained search @xmath103 , we take an indirect path for the purpose of demonstration . in the following we work with atomic excited - state densities generated by hs exchange - only potential and",
    "take these as the excited - state density .",
    "the densities and the energies obtained by the hs formalism are essentially the same as those of hartree - fock(hf)@xcite theory for both the ground as well as the excited - states . similarly the hs exchange potential is very close to the true local exchange potential of the optimized potential method(opm ) .",
    "thus the formalism is well suited to test the ideas presented above .",
    "thus we start with this given @xmath104 $ ] combination .",
    "+     state of @xmath31 corresponding to the original and one alternative configuration.,width=480,height=316 ]    we first demonstrate that an excited - state density is generated by different external potentials depending on the configurations chosen to generate the density .",

    "the potentials are compared with the true external potential @xmath111 .",

    "this , as pointed out earlier , sometimes leads to non - satisfaction of the levy - nagy criterion . shown in fig .",
    "3 are the @xmath112 corresponding to the ground - state densities of different configurations for the excited - state density of @xmath35 state of @xmath31 .",
    "these potential are also obtained by subtracting from the kohn - sham potential @xmath34 the coulomb and the harbola - sahni exchange potential calculated by occupying the corresponding ks orbitals in the ground - state configuration .",
    "we see that whereas the true external potential is @xmath113 , the external potentials corresponding to the ground - states are different .",
    "it is this difference that leads to the ground - state densities different from the true one , and also sometimes to inconsistencies between the ks and the true systems .",
    "+ finally we show that a comparison of the kinetic - energies(ke ) leads to the appropriate kohn - sham system .",
    "we demonstrate this with the densities generated using the hs exchange potential and with one example with correlated density .",
    "the numbers for the noninteracting kinetic energy for different configurations corresponding to the same excited - state densities as considered earlier are shown in tables  vi and vii and are compared with their original kinetic energy . since the hs potential is a local potential itself , the correct configuration gives @xmath114 ( slight difference arising due to numerical calculations ) and wrong ones a larger value , as is evident from the numbers in the tables .",
    "we see that unlike the levy - nagy criterion , a comparison of excited - state ke leads to a proper ks system in @xmath115 the cases .",
    "of course when we use the correlated densities , the difference @xmath116 is not going to be @xmath117 for the proper configuration but should be the smallest .",
    "this is clearly seen in the example of @xmath118 state of he atom where the true @xmath119 $ ] is @xmath120 .",
    "we have used the zmp procedure to obtain the ks potentials in this case also and see that ke for the @xmath121 and the @xmath122 configurations is @xmath123and @xmath124 , respectively . in the latter case it is closer to the true kinetic energy of the system .",
    "thus the configuration @xmath125 represents the ks system for the @xmath126 density .",
    "building on the work of grling and levy and nagy , we have presented in this paper a consistent theory of excited states within the density - functional formalism .",
    "the theory is based on constrained - search and defines a bi - density functional @xmath127 $ ] without the orthogonality constraint of levy - nagy .",
    "further the theory gives a clear definition of the excited - state kohn - sham systems as that whose kinetic and exchange - correlation energy components are closest to those of the true system .",
    "this avoids the problem of comparing the non - self - consistent ground - state densities , as proposed in the ln theory , so no inconsistency arises in identifying an excited - state kohn - sham system .",
    "+ to conclude , we have analyzed the theoretical foundations of excited - state time - independent density - functional theory and have put kohn - sham calculations for excited - states on a firm footing .",
    "it is clear from our present work that an excited - state configuration of the ks system corresponds to a similar excited - state of the true system ( with the major component of the excited - state wavefunction involving the same orbitals as the ks system ) .",
    "the work should also help in providing guidance in construction of the excited - state exchange - correlation energy functionals to facilitate self - consistent determination of the excited - state energies .",

    "<S> based on the work of grling and that of levy and nagy , density - functional formalism for many fermionic excited - states is explored through a careful and rigorous analysis of the excited - state density to external potential mapping . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the knowledge of the ground - state density is a must to fix the mapping from an excited - state density to the external potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is the excited - state counterpart of the hohenberg - kohn theorem , where instead of the ground - state density the density of the excited - state gives the true many - body wavefunctions of the system . </S>",
    "<S> further , the excited - state kohn - sham system is defined by comparing it s non - interacting kinetic energy with the true kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is demonstrated by studying a large number of atomic systems . </S>"
