    "the timing observations of radio - pulsars provide a unique tool to study the properties of superdense matter in compact stars . while pulsars are known to be prefect clocks over long periods of time , the timing observations of past few decades revealed several types of timing `` irregularities '' in a subclass of isolated compact objects .",
    "glitches ( or macrojumps ) - sudden increases in the pulsar rotation frequency and its derivative - are the most spectacular examples of timing anomalies .",
    "the slow relaxation of their spin and its derivative following a glitch has been interpreted as an evidence for superfluidity of compact star interiors  @xcite . at temperatures prevailing in an evolved compact star the dense hadronic matter is expected to be in the superfluid state due to the attractive component of the nuclear force which binds neutrons into cooper pairs either in the relative @xmath0 state ( at low densities ) or @xmath1 state ( at high densities ) @xcite .",
    "other members of the spin-1/2 octet of baryons ( protons and strangeness @xmath2 particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) are expected to pair in the @xmath5-wave channel due to their low concentration .",
    "if the central densities of compact stars exceed the density of deconfinement phase transition to a quark matter phase , the deconfined quark matter will be in one of the many possible color superconducting states @xcite . since the glitches are related to the axisymmetric perturbations from the state of uniform rotation",
    "there is a twofold degeneracy in the interpretation of the data on both the jumps and the post - jump relaxations ; the time - scales of these processes can be associated either with the weak or strong coupling between the superfluid and normal fluid in the star s interiors , and it is impossible to distinguish between these regimes on the basis of glitch observations alone . during the recent years it became increasingly clear that another type of timing anomaly - the long term periodic variations superimposed on the spin - down of the star - can provide an additional and independent information on the dynamical coupling between the superfluid and the normal fluid in compact stars . if these irregularities are interpreted in terms of the precession of the star ( a motion which involves non - axisymmetric perturbations from the rotational state ) the degeneracy inherent to the interpretation of glitches is lifted .",
    "it turns out that the free precession is possible only in the weak coupling limit and it is damped in the strong coupling case .",
    "interpretations of the timing anomalies in pulsars in terms of the friction between the superfluid and the normal fluid require a model of the friction between the superfluid and normal components of the star on mesoscopic scales characteristic for the vorticity .",
    "this paper discusses two new mechanism of mutual friction in the core of a neutron star in the case where protons form a type - i superconductor .",
    "the remainder of the introduction sets the stage by briefly reviewing the relevant physics .",
    "section [ 1 + 1 ] studies the dynamics of a type - i superconducting model where there is a single normal domain per rotational vortex . in section [ 1+n ]",
    "we discuss the dissipation in an alternative picture where there is a large number of rotational vortices associated with a single normal domain .",
    "section [ conclude ] is devoted to the implications of the dissipative dynamics of type - i superconductors for the free precession of compact stars and contains a brief summary of the results .      to see how the superfluidity of neutron stars changes their eulerian precession ( which would be intact if the neutron stars were non - superfluid ) let us begin with the equation of motion of approximately massless neutron vortex [ eq:1 ] _ s ( v_s - v_l)n -u-(nu ) = 0 , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the velocities of the superfluid , the normal fluid and the vortex ; @xmath10 is the effective neutron density",
    ", @xmath11 is the quantum of circulation , @xmath12 , and the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the measure of the friction between the neutron vortex and the ambient normal fluid .",
    "here we work within the two - fluid superfluid hydrodynamics , where it is assumed that the hydrodynamic forces are linear functions of the velocities , which guarantees that the energy variation is always a quadratic form .",
    "shaham first observed that the long - term , eulerian precession is impossible if the neutron vortices are strongly pinned @xcite . in terms of the mesoscopic parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , his observation is equivalent to the statement that precession is absent in the limit @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the drag - to - lift ratios . since in the frictionless limit a star",
    "must precess at the classical frequency @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the eccentricity and @xmath21 is the rotation frequency , it is clear that there exists a crossover from the damped to the free precession as @xmath22 is decreased .",
    "the crossover is determined by the dimensionless parameters ( @xmath23 and ( @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the moment of inertia of the superfluid and @xmath26 is the moment of inertia of the crust plus any component coupled to it on time - scales much shorter than the precession timescale and @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 .",
    "the precession frequency is  @xcite ( hereafter swc ) [ precession ] _",
    "p = _ s , where @xmath29 is the spin frequency and @xmath20 is the eccentricity .",
    "the result of swc can be cast in a no - go theorem that states that the eulerian precession in a superfluid neutron star is impossible if ( @xmath30 ( assuming as before @xmath16 ) .",
    "there is a subtlety to this result : the precession is impossible because the precession mode , apart from being damped , is renormalized by the non - dissipative component of superfluid - normal fluid interaction ( @xmath31 . in effect the value of the precession eigen - frequency drops below the damping frequency for any @xmath22 larger than the crossover value .",
    "note that this counter - intuitive result can not be obtained from the arguments based solely on dissipation : in fact , according to eq .",
    "( [ precession ] ) the damping time - scale for precession increases linearly with @xmath22 and in the limit @xmath15 one would predict ( wrongly ) undamped precession .",
    "if a neutron star contains multiple layers of superfluids the picture is more complex , but the generic features of the crossover are the same @xcite .",
    "long term variabilities were observed in a number of pulsars and have been attributed phenomenologically to precession of the neutron star ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a strong case for long - term variability ( again attributed to precession ) was made recently by stairs et al @xcite . while it is common to study perturbations from the state of uniform rotation ,",
    "wasserman @xcite demonstrated that the precessional state may correspond to the local energy minimum of an inclined rotator if there is a large enough magnetic stress on the star s core .",
    "this type of precession is likely to be damped away by the superfluid - normal friction .",
    "link @xcite argued that the long - term variations , which can be fitted by assuming eulerian precession of the pulsar , are incompatible with type - ii superconductivity of neutron stars .",
    "type - i superconductivity was proposed to resolve the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "jones @xcite argued that the friction of vortices in the crusts against the nuclear lattice will give rise to a dissipation which will damp the free precession ; thus , the free precession ( even in absence of pinning ) would be incompatible with the known properties of matter at subnuclear densities .",
    "as is well known , type - i superconductivity arises when the ginzburg - landau parameter satisfies the condition @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the magnetic field penetration depth and @xmath34 is the coherence length",
    ". type - i superconductivity can arise locally within the current models based on the bcs theory @xcite , with domain structures analogous to those observed in laboratory experiments . in ref .",
    "@xcite the theory of these structures was constructed along the lines of the theories developed for laboratory superconductors , where the magnetic fields are generated by normal currents driven around a cylindrical cavity by temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "however , global type - i superconductivity would require a suppression of the proton pairing gap @xmath35 ( due to the scaling @xmath36 ) by polarization or related effects .",
    "buckley et al @xcite studied the effect the interactions between the neutron and proton cooper pairs would have on the type of the proton superconductivity .",
    "their results suggest that type - i superconductivity can be enforced within the entire core without the suppression of the pairing gap if the strength of the yet unknown interaction between cooper pairs will turn out to be significant .",
    "the equilibrium structure of the alternating superconducting and normal domains in a type - i superconductor is a complicated problem and depends , among other things , on the nucleation history of the superfluid phase .",
    "the equilibrium dimension of a layer is of the order of magnitude @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the size of the core ; ( for typical parameter values @xmath39 cm and @xmath40 fm , @xmath41 cm ) . by flux conservation ,",
    "the ratio of the sizes of the superfluid and normal domains is given by the relation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 g is the average value of the magnetic induction , @xmath44 g is the thermodynamic magnetic field .",
    "the dimensional analysis above suggests that there is roughly a single normal domain per neutron vortex .",
    "we shall consider below the dynamics of two distinct models where ( i ) a neutron vortex features a single coaxial normal domain of a smaller size according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter @xmath45 model ) and ( ii ) a large fraction of neutron vortices is accommodated by a single normal domain , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath46 model ) .",
    "the difference between these models is not simply the number of the neutron vortices accommodated by a single non - superconducting domain ; in the 1 + 1 model the magnetic fields are generated dynamically ( this is explained in more detail below ) and hence the normal domains are tied to the neutron vortices on dynamical times scales . in effect the motion of a neutron vortex requires the motion of the normal domain attached to it on the dynamical timescale .",
    "therefore the dissipation is due to the interaction between the combined structure ( a vortex plus a normal domain ) with the background electron liquid .",
    "while it is conceivable that the normal domains are tied up to the macroscopic neutron vortex lattice on certain timescales in the @xmath46 model , we shall assume that the neutron vortex lattice sweeps through the non - superconducting domains and the dissipation arises from the scattering of the normal protons off the cores of rotational vortices @xcite .",
    "in two component superfluids the supercurrent of any given component transports mass of both components ; this is the essence of the entrainment effect first studied in the context of charge neutral and non - rotating superfluid mixtures of @xmath47he-@xmath48he @xcite .",
    "if one of the components is charged - a case first studied in refs .",
    "@xcite - the neutral superfluid which rotates by forming a lattice of charge - neutral vortices generates magnetic fields because neutral supercurrent carries along a finite mass of the charged component . the mass currents of neutrons and protons @xmath49 ( here and below indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 refer to the protons and neutrons ) , are related to their velocities @xmath52 and @xmath53 by a density matrix in the isospin space @xcite (    c p_p + p_n +    ) = (    cc _ pp&_pn + _ np&_nn +    ) (    c v_p + v_n +    ) , where in the mean - field approximation the elements of the density matrix can be expressed through the effective masses of neutrons and protons .",
    "mendell obtained previously the general form of mutual friction damping from vortices , which incorporated the entrainment effect , in the case of type - ii superconductivity @xcite .",
    "if the proton superconductor is type - i , non - superconducting domains coaxial with the neutron vortices nucleate in response to the entrainment current set - up by the    vortex circulation  @xcite .",
    "consider a cylindrical domain of radius @xmath54 coaxial with a vortex ( see fig . 1 for an illustration ) .",
    "in the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) with the symmetry axis at the center of the vortex the magnetic field induction is [ ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 20 ) ] [ eq:2 ] b_z(r ) = ( ) , b_x = b_y = 0 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the flux quantum , @xmath33 is the magnetic field penetration depth , @xmath60 is the vortex ( outer ) radius and [ eq:3 ] n(r ) = i_0()k_0 ( ) -k_0()i_0 ( ) , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the modified bessel functions . in the mean - field approximation",
    "the magnitude of the ( non - quantized ) flux @xmath63 is determined by the effective mass of a proton quasiparticle @xmath64 .",
    "now we can write down the proton supercurrent @xmath65 by substituting the @xmath66-field from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "we need , however , the velocity of superfluid protons , which is the difference between the net supercurrent and the supercurrent moving with the neutron superfluid velocity ; we find [ eq:4 ] v_p = .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) keeps the leading order term of the expansion of the bessel functions with respect to large arguments @xmath67 , where @xmath55 is a mesoscopic scale @xmath68 .",
    "consider now a vortex which moves at a constant velocity @xmath9 , and carries a coaxial normal domain of protonic fluid with respect to the background electron liquid ( see fig .",
    "the equation of motion of the superfluid protons , written in the reference frame where the vortex is at rest , acquires an additional term @xmath69 .",
    "the continuity of the electro - chemical potentials of the superfluid and normal phases across the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases gives @xmath70 , where _ s = -m_p^ * v_l v_p(r ) , _",
    "n = -e , here @xmath71 is the proton chemical potential in equilibrium , @xmath56 is the scalar electric potential and we use 2d cartesian coordinates with vortex circulation along @xmath57-axis and vortex velocity along the @xmath72-axis , see fig .",
    "1 ; small terms @xmath73 ) are neglected .",
    "thus , the motion of the vortex generates a constant transverse electric field across the normal domain [ eq:6 ] e_y = -_y = - , e_x = e_z=0 .",
    "the power dissipated per unit length of a vortex is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the electrical conductivity and the factor @xmath76 is the fractional 2d volume occupied of the domain . upon substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) in this relation , we obtain an alternative form of dissipation @xmath77 , which identifies the friction coefficient [ eq:7 ] = ( ) ^2 ^2 . equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) is our central result , which defines the friction coefficient for a vortex featuring a single coaxial domain of a type - i proton superconductor in terms of the electrical conductivity of the electron fermi - liquid in normal proton matter .",
    "since the mean - free path of electrons is much smaller than the size of a single normal domain , we can neglect the finite - size effects and use the result for the bulk normal matter @xcite .",
    "the zero - field conductivity of ultra - relativistic electrons is @xmath78 , where the relaxation time for the coulomb scattering of electrons off the protons in the normal domains is @xcite [ eq:8 ] _ c = ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the electron fermi - energy and fermi - wavenumber , and @xmath81^{1/2 } $ ] is the thomas - fermi wave - length .",
    "since the larmor radius of an electron moving in a normal domain carrying a field @xmath82 g is much smaller than the linear size of the domain , the conductivity becomes @xmath83 where @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "table i lists some of the relevant parameters of the problem , including transport quantities and the drag - to - lift ratio at the temperature @xmath86 k. the kinetic coefficients can be rescaled to other temperatures by using the scalings @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the drag - to - lift ratio satisfies the condition @xmath90 at all temperatures ( the largest values correspond to temperatures just below the critical temperature @xmath91 k ) .",
    "we shall return to the implications of these results for the neutron star precession in the closing section .",
    ".listed are the protons density ( column 1 ) , the fermi - wave number ( 2 ) , the effective mass of protons ( 3 ) , the magnetic field penetration depth ( 4 ) , the critical thermodynamic field ( 5 ) , the electron relaxation time ( 6 ) , the electrical conductivity ( 7 ) , and the drag - to - lift ratio ( 8) .",
    "the short - hand notions @xmath92 , etc . , are used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the result for the friction coefficient @xmath13 and the corresponding drag - to - lift ratio for several densities are listed in table ii for the case where the proton fluid is non - superconducting . for a given model of the type - i superconducting structure",
    ", the friction coefficient @xmath13 must be rescaled by a factor @xmath93 .",
    "the swc no - go theorem requires the condition @xmath94 to be fulfilled for precession to occur ; otherwise the precession is damped .",
    "the magnitude of the ratio @xmath95 depends on the superfluid - normal fluid friction within all superfluid regions of a neutron star and is difficult to access .",
    "glitches and post - glitch relaxation provide a model independent lower bound on @xmath96 .",
    "an upper bound is difficult to place , since the deep interiors of neutrons stars , if superfluid , could be decoupled from the observable parts of the star on evolutionary timescales without any effect on short time - scale physics @xcite ( but one needs @xmath97 , rather than @xmath98 , to prevent the damping of the precession ) .",
    "however , it is rather unlikely that this ratio exceeds unity by many orders of magnitude . for the first dissipation channel",
    "studied @xmath99 ( table i ) and this clearly suggests an undamped precession .",
    "the second chanel is more effective , @xmath100 ( table ii ) , but these numbers must be reduce by a factor @xmath101 . on account of the lower bound on the ratio of the moments of inertia",
    ", one can conclude that the precession is undamped for both dissipation mechanism .",
    "we have provided a first discussion of the dynamics of the type - i superconducting domains in neutron star interiors . although the details of the coupling of the superconducting and normal components of the star depend on the form of the superconducting - normal structures that nucleate and , in particular , whether the non - superconducting domains are dynamically coupled to the rotational vortices or not , in all cases we find friction coefficients that imply undamped precession .",
    "the results above by no means suggest that type - i superconductivity is the only resolution to the precession puzzle and alternatives should be searched for .",
    "an alternative to free , eulerian precession is the forced precession due to time - dependent periodic torques @xcite .",
    "other periodic motions , for example , tkachenko oscillations of the vortex lattice could generate the observed timing features @xcite . while the eigen - frequencies of the tkachenko modes are of correct order of magnitude and could explain long - term periodicities it remains to be studied whether these modes will be undamped by the mutual friction between the superfluid and the normal fluid .",
    "the fact that statistically insignificant number of pulsars show long - term variabilities , indicates that a subtle tuning is needed for the underlying mechanisms to work .",
    "on the other hand , the eulerian precession , if undamped , should be a common place in the pulsar population , since neutron stars frequently undergo non - axisymmetric perturbations such as glitches and quakes .",
