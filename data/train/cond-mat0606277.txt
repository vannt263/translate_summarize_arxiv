    "an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a simple nonequilibrium stochastic lattice model of transport process .",
    "asep is defined on a one - dimensional lattice , and particles hop to the neighbouring site when the site is empty .",
    "the transportation of particles is induced by the asymmetric hopping of the particles .",
    "recently much attention is paid to asep @xcite , not only because there exists the exact solution under the open boundary condition @xcite , but also it is applicable to various transportation phenomena . in particular ,",
    "the uni - directional asep which is called totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) has been studied extensively , because ( i ) tasep is the simplest asep and ( ii ) tasep keeps the essence of nonequilibrium transport processes such as the exclusion interaction between particles and the drift of particles .",
    "in fact , tasep may be regarded as a simplified model of traffic flow @xcite .",
    "we can also apply asep to biological problems .",
    "tasep is first introduced as a model to explain the process of creation of the messenger rna @xcite . the model with detachment and attachment on each site in tasep with open boundary conditions",
    "is known as pff model @xcite , named after the authors names : parmeggiani , franosch and frey .",
    "an extended model of the pff model is used to describe an intra - cellular transport of the single - headed kinesin ( kif1a ) motor @xcite .    in the open boundary asep",
    ", we can draw the phase diagram by the incoming rate and outgoing rate at the boundaries . on the boundary between the low density phase and high density phase",
    ", it is known that the kink between a sparse region and a jammed region obeys brownian motion . this kink motion in one - lane asep is also studied in terms of the domain wall theory @xcite and the second class particle @xcite . the kink motion in a two - lane tasep is studied in ref.@xcite , and the kink motion in the pff model is studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is notable that the kink is trapped by a harmonic potential in the pff model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the kink motion of tasep with detachment and attachment .",
    "our method can be used for any number of sites of detachment and the attachment .",
    "the effect of detachment of particles at the middle site of the system was studied in ref.@xcite by dividing the system into two systems of tasep , though the kink motion was not discussed there .",
    "we demonstrate that one site of detachment and attachment attracts the kink where attractive potential is a linear function of distance from the site of detachment and attachment .",
    "even when we generalize the model with many sites of detachment and attachment , the kink feels the linear combination of the linear potentials for one - site of detachment and attachment . though the analysis of linear combination of linear potential we derive the harmonic potential in pff model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the model with detachment and attachment at one site and briefly review previous studies on the kink motion in tasep without detachment and attachment in section 2 .",
    "we present a theory of a kink motion in tasep with detachment and attachment at one site , and extend our analysis to the kink motion in tasep with detachment and attachment at many sites including the pff model . in section 3 , we compare our analysis with the monte - carlo simulation and confirm the quantitative agreement between the theory and the simulation . finally , we give concluding remarks .",
    "let us explain tasep model with detachment and attachment of particles at one site under the open boundary conditions .",
    "tasep is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 sites .",
    "each particle hops forward when the site in front is empty .",
    "here we choose right as the drift direction of particles .",
    "the open boundary condition is specified by a particle attachment rate @xmath1 at the left end of the system and a particle detachment rate @xmath2 at the right end . here",
    ", the particle is also detached by the rate @xmath3 and attached by the rate @xmath4 at the site @xmath5 .",
    "tasep with detachment at one site has first been introduced in the ref.@xcite .",
    "they divide the system into two systems of tasep by the site of the detachment , and introduce the effective hopping rate to connect the two systems at the site @xmath5 which is fixed to the middle of the system to include the effect of detachment .",
    "however , we can not explain the kink localization near @xmath5 by introducing the effective hopping rate between two systems because the kink moves under the reflective boundary condition of a virtual boundary in one subsystem where the kink can not cross through the virtual boundary .",
    "thus we need another method to explain the effect of detachment and attachment to the kink motion .",
    "the brownian motion of the kink is characterized by two parameters , the drift velocity @xmath6 and the diffusion constant @xmath7 . in the case of tasep , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are written as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density in the left of the kink and @xmath10 is the density in the right of the kink which satisfy @xmath11 .",
    "thus once @xmath9 and @xmath10 are known , the motion of the kink can be determined .",
    "it is known that the brownian motion in a potential @xmath12 is written by the langevin equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the random force satisfies @xmath15 where @xmath16 is dirac s delta function .",
    "the corresponding fokker - plank equation to eq.([langevin ] ) is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the probability distribution of the brownian particle at position @xmath19 at time @xmath20 .",
    "equation ( [ fokk ] ) has the steady solution @xmath21 @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the normalization constant .",
    "we expect that this well - known result can be used to describe the steady distribution of the kink in our model",
    ".    for tasep without detachment and attachment , @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy @xmath24 for @xmath25 . from eq.([vandd ] ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively given by @xmath26    if there is a site with detachment and attachment , the phase diagram may be modified from that of the original tasep .",
    "however the difference is expected to be small for small rate of the detachment and attachment ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus the kink picture may be still valid for @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider the kink motion in tasep with detachment and attachment at one site .",
    "if there is no detachment and attachment of particles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given by eq.([fden ] ) .",
    "however , as a result of detachment and attachment the density is deviated from eq.([fden ] ) .",
    "let us consider the deviation of the density for two cases : ( a ) the site of the detachment and attachment is in the low density region of the kink and when ( b ) the site of detachment and attachment is in the high density region of the kink .",
    "let us think of the case ( a ) .",
    "the density in the left of the kink position @xmath5 is not affected by detachment and attachment at @xmath5 but the density in the right of @xmath5 becomes higher as in the fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "this situation takes place because attachment process is likely for low - density region in the one - way motion of the particles .",
    "we introduce @xmath29 as the density in the right of @xmath5 when @xmath5 is in the low density region of the kink .",
    "thus @xmath9 should be @xmath30 while @xmath10 is unaffected as @xmath31 when @xmath5 is in the low density region of the kink .    when @xmath5 is in the high density region of the kink as in the case ( b ) ,",
    "the density is affected as in the fig.[fig1](b ) . in this case ,",
    "density in the right of @xmath5 is not affected by detachment and attachment but the density in the left of @xmath5 is changed by detachment and attachment .",
    "the high density of the particles induce the excess of the detachment current to the attachment current for @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be replaced by @xmath33 and @xmath34 when @xmath5 is in the high density region of the kink .",
    "is in the low density region of the kink , and the figure ( b ) shows the case when @xmath5 is in the high density region of the kink . the line shows the density profile . ]    now , let us determine the value of @xmath35 and @xmath29 .",
    "since the exact solution in the steady state of this model is not known , we adopt the decouple approximation in which the mean currents @xmath36 in the low density region of the kink and @xmath37 in the high density region of the kink are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . to estimate @xmath29 and @xmath35 , we use the current conservation at the position @xmath5 . for the case when @xmath5 is in the low density region of the kink ,",
    "the current from the left of @xmath5 is @xmath40 and the current to the right of @xmath5 is @xmath41 .",
    "the detach current from @xmath5 is @xmath42 and the attach current at @xmath5 is @xmath43 .",
    "thus the equation of the current balance at @xmath5 is given by @xmath44 the solution of ( [ consm ] ) is simply given by @xmath45 here we use the condition that @xmath29 should be reduced to ( [ fden ] ) for @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the current balance equation of @xmath35 is written as @xmath47 and its solution is given by @xmath48    from eq.([vandd ] ) with the consideration around fig.1 , the drift velocities @xmath49 are given by , @xmath50 similarly the diffusion constants @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 here the quantities with the suffix @xmath53 represent those in the right / left of @xmath5 .",
    "using @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 , the steady solution of the fokker - planck equation can be written as , @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a normalization constant , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 otherwise .",
    "for @xmath63 , the relations @xmath64 are satisfied . thus the solution ( [ stsol ] )",
    "becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . from the comparison of eq.([eqsolb ] ) with eq.([mome ] ) , the potential energy @xmath12 is given by @xmath68 this is one of the main results in this paper .",
    "the validity of our theory will be confirmed by monte - carlo simulation in section 3 .",
    "here we generalize the model in the previous subsection to a model with many sites of detachment and attachment . to ensure the domain wall picture",
    ", we assume that @xmath69 are small and the relations eq.([kome ] ) are satisfied . substituting the expansion @xmath29 by @xmath70 that @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 in this linear regime",
    ", we can obtain the probability function of the kink in many sites of detachment and attachment .",
    "let us consider the system with @xmath73 sites of detachment and attachment .",
    "thus the system is divided by @xmath74 segments in which each segment is bounded by the sites of detachment and attachment or the boundaries .",
    "when the kink is located in the @xmath75th segment , the number of sites of detachment and attachment in the left of the kink is @xmath76 .",
    "for each site of detachment and attachment , the current should be conserved .",
    "the density increases by @xmath70 in the low density region as in the eq.([lin ] ) in each segment .",
    "thus the density @xmath9 in the @xmath75-th segment becomes @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of sites of detachment and attachment in the right of the kink is @xmath78 .",
    "thus the density @xmath10 in the @xmath75-th segment is @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the drift velocity @xmath80 and the diffusion constant @xmath81 in the segment @xmath75 are respectively given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 let us omit @xmath75-dependence in the eq.([diff ] ) by neglecting the term proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "thus the diffusion coefficient is reduced to @xmath85 which is independent of @xmath75 . from eq.([eqsolb ] ) , the kink probability distribution @xmath86 in the segment @xmath75 is given by @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is a constant determined from the normalization and the compatibility relation @xmath89 thus we obtain the formula applicable to any number of sites of detachment and attachment .",
    "it should be noted that the denominator in the exponential function in eq.([distri ] ) contain @xmath90 .",
    "this is because we simply put @xmath91 in eq.([diff2 ] ) into eq.([eqsolb ] )",
    ". it may be controversial to contain @xmath90 in the denominator as the systematic approximation , but the expression gives us the accurate result as will be shown later .",
    "this method is also applicable to the pff model@xcite , where the number of detachment and attachment sites @xmath73 is @xmath92 , the segment length is @xmath93 , and the position of the site of detachment and attachment @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "thus the distribution ( [ distri ] ) is reduced to @xmath96 .",
    "we write @xmath97 for the simplification .",
    "the compatibility relation ( [ conn ] ) becomes @xmath98,\\ ] ] and this recursion relation gives @xmath99.\\ ] ] thus the distribution is given by @xmath100.\\ ] ]    this result can be also derived by the superposition of the potential .",
    "the harmonic potential is realized by the superposition of the potential ( [ poten ] ) as @xmath101 thus the distribution of the kink position is given by @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is given by eq.([diff2 ] ) , and the probability distribution function of the kink position ( [ pfff ] ) is identical to eq.([dbae ] ) .",
    "now let us check the quantitative accuracy of our theoretical argument .",
    "we compare our analysis with the results of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the simulation is carried out by the random update scheme @xcite , which is realized by choosing the bond between two neighbouring site randomly and move the particle in the chosen sites stochastically .",
    "we use the motion of the second class particle which is a tracer particle of the kink position to detect the kink position @xcite .",
    "if we write @xmath103 for a hole ( empty site ) , @xmath93 for a particle and @xmath104 for the second class particle , the second class particle moves as @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the hole is moved to the left of the second class particle , and the particle is moved to the right of the second class particle . thus the second class particle is positioned between the low density region of particles and the high density region of particles . thus the second class particle can detect the kink position .",
    "we compare the probability function of the kink position obtained by the simulation with the distribution function ( [ stsol ] ) .    ) and the solution of the fokker - plank equation ( solid line).the horizontal axis is the kink position and the vertical axis is the distribution function of the kink position in the steady state plotted in the semi - log scale .",
