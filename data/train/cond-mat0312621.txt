    "nanoscale islands consisting of @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 atoms have captured great interest over recent years for a variety of reasons . from a practical standpoint",
    ", they provide a precursor to the formation of quantum dots , which , if assembled in a controlled way , can serve as the basic ingredients of nano - scale electronic and mechanical devices . many crystallites or nanomounds",
    "are best viewed as  wedding - cake \"- like stacks of such islands .",
    "@xcite they are the intermediary between a flat surface and a small three - dimensional structure .",
    "in contrast to steps , which require vicinal surfaces@xcite that often must be well characterized over mesoscopic regions , islands can be studied in smaller - scale regions that are flat only locally .    of particular interest to us",
    "are the shape and the fluctuations of the perimeter of these islands .",
    "the shape provides information about the line tension or step free energy per length , from which one can compute the step stiffness that describes the  inertial \" properties of steps .",
    "the  dipole \" mode of these fluctuations are known to underlie the diffusion of such islands , a concept now used routinely in simulations.@xcite however , shorter - wavelength modes are also of great interest , since they can be correlated with similar fluctuations of steps and provide a way to assess , again , the stiffness of the step and also the kinetic or atomistic diffusion coefficient associated with the mechanism that dominates the atomistic processes underlying the fluctuations . until recently",
    ", attention was limited to structures for which crystal anisotropy could seemingly be ignored .    here",
    "we pay particular attention to the role of the inevitable anisotropy of crystal surfaces , which around room temperature or even above it is typically sufficiently strong that it should apparently be taken into account in order to correctly characterize the morphology of the various ( near ) equilibrium structures appearing on surfaces and their dynamics . in this paper",
    "we focus on the line tension and stiffness and their orientation dependence ; we give an analytic method to calculating these physical parameters from the fluctuation of nanoscale islands .",
    "the little experimental data on such systems involve runs of worrisome duration or use probes that provide scanned rather than instantaneous images .",
    "to generate fully - characterized data , we turned to kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations to mimic the equilibrium fluctuations of islands .",
    "these simulations are the input of our analytic theory which , starting from the excess free energy corresponding to the capillary wave fluctuations of the island edge , provides the _ eigenmodes _ of these fluctuations . since the 2d wulff plot relating the equilibrium island shape and the line tension in the azimuthal directions on the surface provides only _ relative _ line tensions for various orientations , a key problem is always the determination of the chemical potential @xmath2 of the island edge , which then produces an _",
    "absolute _ relation .",
    "this potential can be determined with surprisingly good ( @xmath3% ) accuracy from the spectrum of the modes of the system .",
    "we compare these eigenmodes and the simple fourier modes of the fluctuations and reach the ( perhaps ) surprising conclusion that the anisotropy only affects the longer wavelength modes .",
    "another aim of the paper is to examine the correlation of the fluctuations of the fourier modes and thereby to find the rate - limiting process driving the fluctuations in a fairly realistic model . for our kmc simulations we sought a system for which one could compute hop rates with good accuracy and for which there was quantitative experimental data with which to compare .",
    "accordingly , we have chosen pb(111 ) so as to be able to compare with intriguing recent experiments by thrmer _",
    "et al._@xcite this analysis gives the scaling of the correlation time with the wavelength , that is the dynamic exponent @xmath4 , and provides us with characteristic times measured not only in mc steps , but in _ real _ time .",
    "thus , we can compare directly with experiments and extrapolate to different structures from the simple one considered here .    utilizing direct surface imaging techniques , especially scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) ,",
    "several attempts have been made to measure and calculate step energies . from a theoretical viewpoint",
    "the various methods that used the experimental data for calculations can be broken down into two main groups .",
    "the first is based on a lattice model which relates the island shape ( radius and curvature ) to the temperature dependence of the free energy and stiffness of the ising model in the low - temperature expansion , usually in high symmetry directions . by fitting the functional shape of the free energy with varying temperature on the experimental data determined by the equilibrium island shape",
    "@xcite gives the ising kink energy , which in turn provides the step energies and stiffnesses .",
    "however , limitations of the ising model to describe surface structure have recently been noted.@xcite    the other method is based on a step continuum model which makes use of stochastic differential equations to describe the fluctuations of straight steps @xcite or island edges@xcite viewed as nearly circular closed - loop steps .",
    "thus , the initial calculations for island fluctuations assumed isotropy:@xcite the power spectrum of the fourier modes of the step fluctuations were calculated and adapted with appropriate modifications to nearly circular island shapes.@xcite if the anisotropy turns out to be strong , it can not be handled as a perturbation ; a complete anisotropic calculation without any such assumptions becomes necessary .",
    "( color online ) geometry of the mc simulation .",
    "the approximate mean radius @xmath5 of the island and the radius @xmath6 of the container are illustrated . ]",
    "this challenge was recently taken up by khare _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite who give an approximate form for the free energy functional and calculate the chemical potential integrating all the fourier modes in the system by using the generalized equipartition theorem where the modes are buried in a sum . however , these modes are coupled , so any one mode missing ( e.g.  due to lack of experimental resolution ) in the sum can contribute to a deviation from the precise value of the chemical potential by itself and through its coupling to the other modes as well .",
    "in contrast , our approach of analyzing individual modes gives more insight into the extent to which this coupling should be taken into account , and provides the chemical potential in a ( mathematically ) controlled way .",
    "the autocorrelation function of fluctuations of step edges and correlation times have been analyzed theoretically in fourier space based on langevin formalism,@xcite and experimentally in the context of straight - step fluctuations on si(111)@xcite and si(001)@xcite surfaces for relatively long wavelengths .",
    "the rate - limiting kinetics driving these fluctuations are determined by the dynamic exponent , which also sets the universality class to which the system belongs.@xcite ( the roughness exponent is believed to be @xmath7 in our cases . ) the correlation times are theoretically identical to the relaxation times ( or , in some cases , decay times ) of surface features,@xcite such as decay and near - equilibrium build - up of bulges ( of either sign ) along the step edge that also have ( wave)length @xmath8 .",
    "three - dimensional features like mesoscopic ( or smaller ) wires on surfaces as well as the surface corrugations in earlier studies by mullins,@xcite are typically described by 1 + 1 dimensional models but may involve different , more complicated mechanisms driving their fluctuation or decay .",
    "we will compare and discuss these various relaxation times in the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give an analytic solution to the decoupling of the fourier modes of the system into the actual eigenmodes and recalculate the free energy functional of the edge fluctuations .",
    "the results and conclusions can be understood without the reader s going through this algebra ; only the result expressed in eq .",

    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "the relationship between the equilibrium crystal shape and the surface tension or , in our 2d case , between the equilibrium island shape and the line tension of its edge can be established by the minimization of the free energy functional of the island edge .",
    "the orientation - dependent line tension @xmath9 is defined as the work per unit length necessary to create the @xmath10 line element with normal @xmath11 to the perimeter .",
    "the free energy is the integral of this work along the whole perimeter .",
    "the equilibrium island shape at a constant temperature @xmath12 , number of particles @xmath13 , and area @xmath14 , is determined by the minimization of the free energy functional with respect to the shape with the constraint that the island area is constant , typically using the method of lagrange multipliers : @xcite @xmath15&&=\\oint\\limits_{l_{eq}}\\beta ( { \\rm\\bf n})ds-\\lambda \\int \\limits_{\\sigma } d\\sigma = \\nonumber \\\\ = & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_0^{2\\pi}\\!\\!\\beta ( \\psi ( \\theta ) ) \\left(r^{2}+\\dot{r}^{2}\\right)^{1/2}\\!\\!d\\theta -\\lambda\\!\\!\\int\\limits_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{r^{2}}{2}d\\theta .",

    "@xmath86 must be a constant in @xmath87 , the modes , as the temperature and the chemical potential , @xmath2 , are fixed macroscopic parameters of the island . from this equation",
    "one can determine the same @xmath2 , in principle , from any mode .",

    "this @xmath2 was the missing parameter to determine _ absolute _ line tensions , and plugging it back into eq .",
    "( [ eq : betapsi ] ) , we get the line tension in all azimuthal directions .",
    "the scarcity of extensive experimental data leads us to use monte carlo methods to simulate the behavior of the system .",
    "however , use of numerical rather than experimental data for testing of formal ideas has many advantages in any case .",
    "most obviously , in numerical experiments one can obtain far greater control , with no worries about anomalous behavior due to unsuspected stray contaminants .",
    "typically one can generate much more data . in the present experiment , we do not need to worry about the scan rate of the probe ; our lattice configurations are instantaneous snapshots",
    ". another advantage of computer simulations will also become clear in the next section : it allows us to analyze correlation times .    since our original motivation was to simulate the relaxation of a pb crystallite with a ( 111 ) facet , we place a nanoscale island on a triangular lattice .",
    "we surround it by a non - permeable circular container of radius @xmath6 to let the system reach its thermodynamic equilibrium , in order to measure its equilibrium fluctuations.@xcite thus , this geometry corresponds to an island placed on top of a facet of a crystallite ( with an infinite ehrlich - schwoebel barrier ) .",
    "note that by adjusting the permeability one can tune the overall decay rate of the island , which in this paper we fix at zero .",
    ".tabulation of some of the energy barriers used in kmc simulations of pb(111 ) .",
    "the energies in columns 2 and 3 were computed by m. haftel using seam@xcite with glue potentials.@xcite in the last column are the energies used in the simulations .",
    "( the edge - diffusion energy barrier in the break - three scheme is closer to the corner rounding barrier of seam than to the actual straight - edge diffusion barrier of seam ( see text ) ; the latter has a much lower barrier : 108 mev ; unfortunately , the bond - counting method does not distinguish between these two . )",
    "[ tb : enpb ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the temperature of the systems of interest is low compared to the energy barriers of adatomic hopping , we have chosen to use the bortz - kalos - lebovitz ( bkl ) continuous - time mc algorithm@xcite as it is best suited to low temperature systems and as its rejection - free method allows us to greatly improve the efficiency of the simulations compared to traditional metropolis algorithms .",
    "the typical temperatures are around @xmath88 or less for the two - dimensional lattice gas of adatoms on the surface . using the @xmath87-fold way method to keep track of the available mc moves",
    ", we could improve the efficiency even further . because of the small number of energy barriers , the @xmath87-fold way approach ( 5-fold ) is superior to the binary tree implementation of the bkl algorithm@xcite in this case .",
    "since we are not interested in all the details of this surface in the simulations , but only try to capture the main mechanisms , we do not take into account the abc stacking structure of the fcc lattice of pb(111 ) .",
    "hence , the top layer constitutes a triangular lattice with perfect six - fold symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we assume that adatoms can only hop to nearest neighbor sites , and that the energy barrier the adatom has to overcome is determined by the occupation of the 8 sites surrounding , as nearest neighbors , the 2 sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "the energy barriers for hopping rates are mainly based on the semiempirical embedded atom method ( seam)@xcite using ercolessi s glue potentials@xcite for the pb(111 ) surface to derive the bond - counting energy barriers@xcite actually used in the simulations ( see table [ tb : enpb ] ) .",
    "we use variants of simple bond - counting . in what we term the break - three scheme ,",
    "we count only bonds that have been broken with the three sites `` behind '' the move .",
    "if we also include bond - breaking with the 2 sites to the left and the right of the move ( denoted side sites ) , we have a break - five scheme .",
    "the 3 sites in front of the move do not affect the energy barrier in our simulations .",
    "the break - three and break - five schemes both satisfy detailed balance in a straightforward fashion",
    ". they both should give the same results for static parameters , since they are both nearest - neighbor schemes .",
    "comparison runs using this feature provided one test ( among many ) of our program .",
    "however , the kinetics obviously differ because the energy barriers tend to be higher for the break - five scheme , slowing the kinetics significantly . since the energy barriers in the break - three case are closer to the calculated barriers , we choose to use this scheme in our simulations .",
    "in table [ tb : enpb ] we list a few energy barriers calculated by the above - mentioned seam and the corresponding break - three - scheme barriers .",
    "surface diffusion is when an adatom has no other adatoms in the surrounding 8 sites in seam calculations ; in the break - three scheme this barrier also applies to all cases in which any of the side sites or the sites in front are occupied .",
    "this is the reason why the attachment barrier is the same as the surface diffusion barrier .",
    "edge diffusion is the case in which a side site is occupied , as is its nearest neighbor `` behind '' .",
    "the energy barrier associated with this process is 237 mev whereas if there is a nearest in the front as well so that the adatom rolls along three others on one side the third in the front seems to assist the hop a great deal ( at least according to the seam data ) as the barrier is 108mev .",
    "the break - three scheme has the same barrier for these two processes and also for any other in which only one bond is broken .",
    "the break - two - bonds barrier corresponds to a hop with 2 occupied sites in the back , break-3-bonds is when all 3 sites are occupied in the back .",
    "the very high `` out '' energy barrier assures that adatoms can not escape the container ; i.e. , the permeability is zero .",
    "the basic parameters of the surface investigated and the kmc simulations are the following : the nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath89 on the pb(111 ) surface is 3.50 .",
    "the typical island diameter @xmath90 is 40@xmath89 to 80@xmath89 , while the container diameter @xmath6 ranges from 12.5% to 300% larger than the island .",
    "we examined temperatures 250k , 300k , 350k , and 400k . in each mc snapshot of the island",
    ", we measure the island radius from the instantaneous center of mass in @xmath13  equiangular \" directions where @xmath91 if not indicated otherwise .",
    "we start the simulations from a nearly circular shaped configuration and let it relax to equilibrium , starting the mc measurement of the fluctuation and shape after the longest wavelength mode has passed its correlation time . especially at the lower temperatures ,",
    "the typical equilibration times are very long , consistent with other reports.@xcite ensemble averages are taken from 100 to 3000 different runs starting from the same initial configuration , but with different random - number seeds . in each run , after equilibration , we get statistically independent fluctuations at time intervals again determined by the relaxation time of the longest wavelength mode .",
    "we take such independent `` snapshots '' of the islands 5 to 200 times in each run , so that we typically have 10,000 to 70,000 islands over which to average .",
    "as described in detail in sec .",
    "ii , the energetic parameters of the island edge are determined by the island shape and its edge fluctuation . the wulff construction provides the relationship between the relative line tension in the azimuthal directions on the crystal surface and the equilibrium island shape , and the information from the fluctuations @xmath92 of each mode in eq .",

    "iii .    at higher temperatures",
    "the fourier modes deviate less from the eigenmodes for longer wavelengths , as expected since the equilibrium shape is more nearly circular and less affected by the underlying anisotropy .    in earlier work@xcite in which experimental data were used as an input of similar calculations ,",
    "there is a sum over the modes , but because those modes are buried in a sum in the generalized equipartition theorem , one can not see whether they are the modes which satisfy , at least to a certain extent , the equipartition theorem . in those experimental data",
    "the correlation times of the modes are not known and the effect of the finite temporal resolution of the experiment may also interfere with the fluctuations which should in principle be determined from `` snapshots '' , i.e. fast scanned images ",
    "fast at least compared to the correlation times of the modes used in such calculations .",

    "the comparison of these two plots from mc simulations might help analyzing experimental data with limited spatial resolution as well , as it shows how the fourier modes behave in case of undersampling ( @xmath13=90 ) and oversampling ( @xmath13=180 ) .",

    "we have to mention here that we did two sets of kmc simulations .",
    "the simulations described in this paper satisfy detailed balance and sample the canonical distribution , while in the other set we choose the energy barriers to be those calculated by seam , which explicitely violate detailed balance and energy conservation .",

    "for example , in the experiment by thrmer _",
    "et al._,@xcite a small pb crystallite , whose top facet has a perimeter slightly larger than 1200 nm , relaxes at 383k to its equilibrium ( or at least metastable ) shape in 1 - 2 days after being quenched from a higher temperature .",
    "since the crystallite is 30 times larger than the longest wavelengths in our kmc simulations , the relaxation time @xmath126 of the longest wavelength mode of the perimeter of the topmost island on the crystallite is @xmath127 times longer if the rate - limiting kinetics is step - edge diffusion ( though , of course , attachment - detachment and terrace diffusion could be present but not rate - limiting ) .",
    "specifically , the value of @xmath126 is 24.3  sec based on our kmc data at @xmath12=400k . from these data it seems that the island fluctuation is much faster than the decay of the 3d structure ; thus there is no direct relationship between the fluctuation and the decay .     vs. wave number @xmath87 on a log - log scale .",
    "the mc data ( black circles ) show @xmath128 which corresponds to step - edge diffusion .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath4=4 , 3 , and 2 ( from top to bottom ) dynamic exponents .",
    "@xmath107400k , @xmath5=20@xmath89 , @xmath6=40@xmath89 . ]",
    "the above arguments lead to a general view of the evolution of surface structures .",
    "for pb in the temperature range 350 k400 k , one observes the slow development and relaxation of fluctuations at the @xmath129 m scale in experiments . assuming that the rate - limiting kinetics retain the same @xmath1254 range for even longer wavelengths , structures of 10 @xmath129 m size  step edges , islands , etc .   take days to years to change due to the large dynamic exponent , @xmath4 , so in effect they look frozen under laboratory conditions .",
    "this is the reason why these monolayer structures do not show any large - scale changes while on a shorter scale they can be very active .",
    "the structural changes in the 3d crystallites are even slower , they are even more stable .",
    "lowering the temperature makes the length scales  at which evolution or relaxation can be observed  exponentially shorter , which is readily understandable if one looks at the converse of the above arguments .",
    "the length scales with time like @xmath130 ( for @xmath128 ) whereas @xmath131 scales like @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : active ] ) .",
    "thus , the length scales with temperature like @xmath133}$ ] .",
    "this basically means that given the temperature and the time scale of observation , one can calculate an effective length scale , @xmath134 on which the structures on a surface are in equilibrium with their surroundings and actively changing on the time scale of e.g.  stm measurements .",
    "having @xmath134 and the energy barrier @xmath135 at a certain temperature , one can also make at least rough estimates of the effective lengths at other temperatures using this scaling argument .",
    "this picture is certainly a result of simplification , since there is a whole set of energy barriers in such a complex physical system as a crystal surface , and the various atomistic mechanisms governed by different barriers freeze out or get activated at different temperatures , depending on their corresponding energy barriers.@xcite    comparison or extrapolation to other materials is possible if the energy - barrier set is similar to that of pb(111 ) .",
    "then the debye frequency sets the time scale while the energy barriers set the temperature scale , as one can readily deduce it from eq .",
    "( [ eq : active ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy - barrier set is completely different , as for example for si , @xcite it gives rise to a different rate - limiting mechanism namely attachment - detachment for a wide range of temperatures , and such extrapolation is not possible , but a whole set of simulations should be done for the group of materials with this sort of barriers .",
    "in this paper we deduce energetic and kinetic parameters of a particular metal surface below its roughening temperature .",
    "we use kinetic monte carlo simulations to mimic the fluctuations of large nanoscale islands on these smooth surfaces in order to determine equilibrium island shapes , anisotropic line tensions in the azimuthal directions of the surface , and the correlation times of the fourier modes of the fluctuations .",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the chemical potential of the island edge from the equilibrium island shape and the associated capillary wave fluctuations around it .",
    "this chemical potential sets the scale for the anisotropic line tension , [ the azimuthal dependence of ] which is usually known only up to a multiplicative constant . to account for the anisotropy of the line tension",
    ", this procedure contains a transformation from the fourier modes of the island edge fluctuations to the true eigenmodes .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the fourier and eigen modes of the fluctuations reveals that the difference in their spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t400r80r20eigenfouriermodes ] ) is unexpectedly small .",
    "the obtained line tensions  one of the most important physical parameters of steps on surfaces  are in the correct range compared to known experimental results , even in this simplistic model , with its rather small set of hopping - energy barriers in the kmc simulation .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of spatial sampling , which shows that the long wavelength modes are hardly affected by the undersampling ( oversampling)too low ( too high ) resolution of imaging , which means that there are fewer ( more ) sample points on the step edge in the image than actual atoms in the experiment whereas moderately short and short modes change significantly .",
    "the analyses of the correlation times of the fourier modes show that nanoscale objects fluctuate on the msec to @xmath129sec time range at moderately high temperatures ( 400k ) on pb surfaces .",
    "since the atomic processes are activated , this time scale changes dramatically with temperature .    in closing , we comment on the equilibration time of step structures in monte carlo simulations .",
    "the full equilibration of these structures is signalled by the correlation time of the longest wavelength mode , which can be very large ( in cpu time ) for the system sizes and temperatures studied in this paper . to do correct mc measurements _ in equilibrium _",
    ", one has to pass this time ; otherwise , results for `` equilibrium quantities '' can be very misleading , as is well known from non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "if one does not look at correlation times of fourier modes , very careful analysis is required to avoid such equilibration problems.@xcite recently , several papers have appeared concerning correlation functions , persistence , etc .",
    ", of steps much longer than ours,@xcite and sometimes even several of them ( in studies of the interaction between them ) . they might well suffer from these problems since this equilibration time scales with system size as the fourth power , meaning that a system that is twice as big needs an order of magnitude longer cpu time to be equilibrated .",
    "we also point out that the measurement of these fluctuations experimentally might be difficult because of the above - mentioned time scale of the fluctuations .",
    "one either has to use techniques with which snapshots of the surface can be taken,@xcite or , in direct visualization methods ( like stm measurements ) , the scan rate of the equipment must be faster than the fluctuations of a given wavelength of interest .",
    "otherwise one measures the two ends of a wavelength at such a time separation that they are uncorrelated , leading to difficulties of interpretation .",
    "the `` speed '' of the fluctuations can be tuned by changing the temperature , but one also has to take into account that lowering the temperature decreases the size of the fluctuations , rendering the measurement harder .",
    "finally , the extrapolation of our results for nano - objects to mesoscale features makes possible comparisons of correlation times of modes of certain wavelengths , as well as of decay or of relaxation of larger structures to their equilibrium forms .",
    "this comparison reveals that the relaxation of 3d structures of the same lengths are slower than that of the simple step or monatomic high islands , due to additional mechanisms and phenomena like a possible ehrlich - schwoebel barrier , very low detachment rate and perhaps elasticity that affect the 3d structure .",
