    "in reactions induced by weakly bound nuclei , the influence on the fusion process of couplings both to collective degrees of freedom and to breakup / transfer channels is a key point for the understanding of n - body systems in quantum dynamics . due to",
    "the very weak binding energies of halo nuclei , such as @xmath3he or @xmath4be @xcite , a diffuse cloud of neutrons would lead to enhance fusion probabilities below the coulomb barrier , where the neutron tail which extends well beyond the compact nuclear core provides a conduit by which the matter distributions of the target and projectile may overlap at longer range than for the core . in vicinity of the coulomb barrier and below",
    ", the enhanced fusion with @xmath4be was predicted  @xcite . on the other , the main enhancement effect for fusion with @xmath3he compared to its @xmath5he core may be due to the neutron rearrangement giving a gain in energy  @xcite as confirmed experimentally with @xmath6pb and @xmath7au targets  @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental studies involving @xmath3he radioactive ion beams ( rib ) @xcite indicate that the halo of the @xmath3he nucleus does not enhance the fusion probability , illustrating the preponderant role of one- and two - neutron transfers ( tr ) in @xmath3he induced fusion reactions .",
    "hence , the question of a real new effect with rib s and with stable beams such as weakly bound @xmath3li , @xmath8li and @xmath9be nuclei , namely the occurence of non - conventional transfer / stripping processes with large cross sections most likely originating from the small binding energy of the projectile , remains open  @xcite .",
    "r[0cm]8 cm     since the coupling between channels is known to enhance the fusion cross section at sub - barrier energies  @xcite , coupled - channel ( cc ) effects have to be taken into account in the theoretical description of the fusion process .",
    "a large number of experimental results have been interpreted adequately well within the framework of cc calculations . however , in the case of loosely bound ( and/or halo ) systems the situation is more complicated since the breakup channel couples strongly to an infinite number of unbound states into the continuum  @xcite .",
    "a possible treatment of the problem is to reduce it to a finite number of channels .",
    "the traditional approach to discuss the sub - barrier fusion reaction induced by weakly bound nuclei is to solve the cc equations by discretizing in energy the particle continuum states in the projectile nucleus  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called method of continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) that has been initially proposed by rawitscher @xcite , and later developed for light heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "experimental results  @xcite have well confirmed the calculations that fusion cross sections are significantly enhanced due to the couplings to the continuum states at energies below the barrier , while they are hindered above  @xcite . with the recent advent of new rib facilities @xcite",
    ", it should be now possible to constrain more the parameters of the cdcc formalism  @xcite .",
    "several studies have been initiated in this direction @xcite to investigate reactions induced by the neutron halo of the borromean @xmath3he nucleus , which is known to have a strong dipole excitation mode .    in",
    "the recent past a cdcc calculation  @xcite failed to reproduce the large yields of @xmath10-particles reported in the @xmath3he+@xmath11bi reaction  @xcite . in this work",
    "we propose full cdcc calculations describing simultaneously elastic scattering ( see fig .  1 ) , total fusion , and breakup of weakly bound light nuclei both stable ( @xmath3li and @xmath8li ) and radioactive ( @xmath3he ) with a medium - mass target ( @xmath1co ) .",
    "preliminary brief reports have been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "cdcc , a fully quantum - mechanical method developed originally to study the effect of deuteron breakup on the process of elastic scattering  @xcite , has been widely applied by the kyushu group  @xcite to study heavy - ion collisions induced by light weakly bound nuclei .",
    "cdcc calculations have been successful in the past in describing the scattering of deuterons and @xmath0li  @xcite on different targets .",
    "the cdcc method has been then applied to reactions with halo nuclei and , as a consequence , diaz - torres and thompson @xcite have been able to perform a full calculation of the theoretical fusion cross section of halo nuclei using a novel method still based on the cdcc formalism .",
    "a more recent study of the @xmath3he+@xmath11bi reaction by means of a three - body cdcc model  @xcite has shown much larger absorption cross sections than experimental fusion cross sections  @xcite . in the present work",
    "similar cdcc calculations are applied for the interaction of @xmath0li and @xmath3he ( with the simultaneous description of elastic scattering , fusion and breakup ) with a medium - mass target such as @xmath1co , and comparisons with the corresponding experimental data are presented .",
    "details of the calculations concerning the breakup space ( number of partial waves , resonances energies and widths , maximum continuum energy cutoff , potentials , ... ) have been given elsewhere  @xcite , in particular in tables i , ii and iii of ref .",
    "the cdcc scheme is available in the general coupled channels ( cc ) computer code fresco  @xcite .",
    "all calculations were carried out using the version frxx.09 g of fresco @xcite .",
    "our choice was mainly influenced by the fact that we have already carried out extended cdcc calculations for both the @xmath3li+@xmath1co and @xmath8li+@xmath1co total fusion reactions  @xcite which data were previously published  @xcite . before investigating that the proposed cdcc formalism can be also applied to halo nuclei such as @xmath3he , we present the full description of the @xmath3li @xmath12 @xmath10+@xmath13 and @xmath8li @xmath12 @xmath10+@xmath14 clusters as two - body objects , respectively , including elastic scattering angular distributions , total fusion cross sections , and breakup cross sections .",
    "we would like to stress that in the chosen fusion calculations the imaginary components of the off - diagonal couplings in the transition potentials have been neglected , while the diagonal couplings include imaginary parts @xcite .",
    "otherwise full continuum couplings have been taken into account so as to reproduce elastic scattering data when available .",
    "we have used short - range imaginary fusion potentials for each fragment separately ( @xmath10 and @xmath13+target potentials and @xmath10 and @xmath14+target potentials for @xmath3li and @xmath8li , respectively ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the use of incoming wave boundary conditions as performed in ccfull calculations  @xcite , for instance .",
    "results of the comparison of the cdcc calculations for the elastic scattering with the data  @xcite are shown in fig .  1 and fig .  2 for @xmath8li+@xmath1co and @xmath3li+@xmath1co , respectively .",
    "the two different curves are the results of calculations performed with ( solid lines ) and without ( dashed lines ) @xmath0li @xmath12 @xmath10 + @xmath15 breakup couplings to the continuum ( i.e. continuum couplings ) .",
    "the agreement is very good when full continuum couplings are taken into account .",
    "this was also found for the elastic scattering of both @xmath8li+@xmath16cu and @xmath3li+@xmath16cu reactions  @xcite .",
    "the effect of breakup on elastic scattering , stronger for @xmath3li as expected , is illustrated by the difference between the one - channel calculations ( equivalent to the optical - model om calculations  @xcite ) and the full cdcc results .",
    "the cdcc calculations using similar potentials that fit the measured elastic scattering angular distributions  @xcite of fig",
    ".  2 are able to reproduce the breakup cross sections measured for @xmath3li+@xmath1co  @xcite . for @xmath3li",
    "the total calculated breakup cross sections , obtained by integrating contributions from the states in the continuum up to 8 mev , are small as compared with total fusion cdcc  @xcite or experimental  @xcite ( data points in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 ) cross sections .",
    "r[0cm]8 cm     the dynamic polarization potentials ( dpp ) generated by the coupling to breakup channels are determined by the cdcc method .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dpp are obtained at the three bombarding energies for @xmath3li+@xmath1co and @xmath8li+@xmath1co ; their energy dependences appear to show the threshold anomaly only for the latter reaction .",
    "this preliminary conclusion will need to be confirmed by subsequent measurements at several other near - barrier energies .      in the following we present similar calculations applied for the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath3he .",
    "the present case is much more complicated since @xmath3he breaks into three fragments ( @xmath10+n+n ) instead of two ( @xmath10+d ) , and the cdcc method has not yet been developed for two - nucleon halo nuclei .",
    "hence a di - neutron model is adopted for the @xmath3he+@xmath1co reaction : i.e. we assume a two - body cluster structure of @xmath3he = @xmath5he+@xmath17n with an @xmath10-particle core coupled to a single particle , a di - neutron ( @xmath17n ) .",
    "couplings to resonant ( 2@xmath18 , e@xmath19 = 0.826 mev ) and non - resonant continuum states ( up to f - waves ) are included .",
    "it is important to notice that the fact that the di - neutron is not an object with both fixed size and fixed energy ( heisenberg principle ) might be a critical point in the present model .",
    "the maximum energy of the continuum states is still equal to 8 mev .",
    "similarly to our previous work  @xcite , the potentials between the fragments and the @xmath1co target are those obtained with the global broglia - winther woods - saxon parametrization  @xcite .",
    "( the numerical values are : v@xmath20 = -16.89 mev , r@xmath20 = 1.09 fm and a = 0.63 fm ) . for the @xmath10 - 2n binding potential ( 0@xmath18 , g.s . )",
    "we have used the following woods - saxon potential : v@xmath20 = -40.796 mev , r@xmath20 = 1.896 fm and a = 0.3 fm .",
    "binding potential of the @xmath10 particle and the di - neutron provides a 2s bound state of about -0.975 mev .",
    "the binding potential of the 2@xmath18 resonant state has also a woods - saxon form with the following parameters : v@xmath20 = -35.137 mev , r@xmath20 = 1.896 fm , a = 0.3 fm . with this potential",
    "the energy of the 2@xmath18 resonant state is 0.826 mev and its width is 0.075 mev .",
    "to obtain converged ( within a 5@xmath21 level ) total fusion cross section we have included : ( i ) partial waves for @xmath10 - 2n relative motion up to f - waves ( @xmath22 = 3 ) , ( ii ) the @xmath3he fragment - target potential multipoles up to the octupole term , and ( iii ) the maximum of the continuum energy is 8 mev . all resonant and non - resonant continuum couplings including continuum - continuum couplings were included in the calculation .",
    "results of the cdcc calculations for the fusion of @xmath3he+@xmath1co are compared to the @xmath5he+@xmath1co and @xmath3li+@xmath1co systems in fig .  3 and discussed below .",
    "total fusion excitation functions for @xmath5he+@xmath1co ( data points @xcite and solid black line for cc predictions on left panel ) for @xmath3li+@xmath1co ( data points  @xcite on right panel ) , and for @xmath3he+@xmath1co .",
    "the curves correspond to cdcc calculations  @xcite for @xmath3he+@xmath1co with ( dashed line ) or without ( thin line ) couplings to the continuum as discussed in the text ( see sec.2.2).,height=377 ]",
    "the proposed three - body cdcc model is adequate for @xmath8li as well as for @xmath4be , as long as core excitation is ignored ; and , probably better than that for @xmath3li .",
    "however the elastic scattering data @xcite as plotted in figs .  1  and  2 are very well reproduced for both @xmath8li and @xmath3li .",
    "it is interesting to note that the om analysis @xcite of their respective angular distributions was found to be ambiguous for the two lowest energies when using the parameter - free so paulo om potential  @xcite .",
    "the extracted total reaction cross sections @xcite confirm the observed small enhancement ( @xmath23 factor 2 ) of total fusion cross section for the more weakly bound @xmath3li nucleus at sub - barrier energies  @xcite , with similar yields for both reactions at and above the coulomb barrier in concordance with cdcc calculations  @xcite .",
    "this moderate enhancement effect observed below the barrier can be explained by the fact that both experimental  @xcite and theoretical breakup cross sections  @xcite are rather small ( 10 - 50 mb ) .    without available data for @xmath3he+@xmath1co",
    "we have cautiously decided not to present cdcc calculations for the elastic scattering as the coulomb dipole excitation is known to be too strong in the di - neutron approximation  @xcite , and then difficult to be predicted .",
    "the dipole coulomb excitation of @xmath3he projectiles in the field of a highly charged target has already been discussed @xcite .",
    "the di - neutron cdcc model works much better when the dipole coupling strengh is reduced by 50 @xmath21 .",
    "this reduction is important for heavy targets , but probably not as much for a medium - mass target such as @xmath1co .",
    "nevertheless , such reduction is also reducing total absorption cross section in the cdcc calculations .",
    "if we consider this cross section as the total fusion cross section , we may overestimate the fusion of @xmath3he+@xmath1co slightly .",
    "obviously , the search for similar effects is of high interest for this medium - mass region  @xcite , and elastic measurements with higher precision will have to be undertaken .",
    "there is some confusion about the definition of fusion  @xcite .",
    "theorists usually define complete fusion ( cf ) as the capture of all projectile fragments , and incomplete fusion ( icf ) the capture of only some fragments  @xcite . among other cc calculations ,",
    "cdcc has the disadvantage of being unable to distinguish between cf and icf  @xcite . in experiments a similar complication arises from the lack of a clear separation of cf and icf cross sections  @xcite : therefore cf is defined experimentally as the capture of all the charge of the projectile by the target @xcite .",
    "it is believed that there is a significant contribution of breakup followed by cf to the total fusion cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of breakup and tr in the cc ( cdcc ) approach has not been fully studied so far in the context of sub - barrier fusion .",
    "cdcc calculations using the set of parameters given for the @xmath3he+@xmath1co reaction in the previous section are displayed in fig .",
    "the present calculations do not include neither target excitations nor tr channnels .",
    "however with crude estimations as those performed for the @xmath3li+@xmath1co reaction  @xcite the effect is found to be very small . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the total fusion excitation functions of the two @xmath3he+@xmath1co ( cdcc calculations ) and @xmath3li+@xmath1co ( experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite ) reactions . for the @xmath3he reaction ,",
    "the incident energy is also normalized with the coulomb barrier v@xmath24 of the bare potential .",
    "the first calculation ( solid line ) only include the reorientation couplings in fusion without breakup .",
    "all contiunum and reorientation couplings are included in fusion with breakup ( dashed curve ) . in agreement with heavier targets data  @xcite",
    ", we can observe that both calculated curves ( with and without breakup ) give much larger total fusion cross section for @xmath3he as compared to @xmath3li .",
    "we can also observe that the inclusion of the couplings to the breakup channels notably increases the total fusion cross section for the whole energy range .",
    "similar conclusions are reached when @xmath3he+@xmath1co ( cdcc calculations ) is compared to @xmath5he+@xmath1co ( here the cdcc calculations are fitting the data of ref .",
    "@xcite remarkably well ) in fig .  3 .",
    "halo and cluster nuclei , with well - defined breakup and fusion modes , are good test - benches for theories of fusion and breakup .",
    "a more complete theoretical model of few - body dynamics that is able to distinguish cf from icf will need to follow correlations after breakup , so we need either three - body ( and most preferably four - body  @xcite ) state - of - art cdcc @xcite calculations of the type we have presented here as a starting point or , for instance , the use of a time - dependent wave - packet model  @xcite .",
    "the cdcc formalism , with continuum - continuum couplings taken into account , is most probably one of the most accurate method nowadays .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of @xmath2he induced fusion reactions with the cdcc method is being undertaken .",
    "however up to now only very scarce studies with @xmath3he projectiles are available @xcite : data from spiral and louvain - la - neuve have recently been published for @xmath3he+@xmath25cu  @xcite and for @xmath3he+@xmath26zn @xcite .",
    "the present extensive cdcc calculations show that for @xmath3he+@xmath1co considerable enhancement of the sub - barrier fusion cross sections is predicted as compared to measured fusion yields for both the @xmath3li+@xmath1co  @xcite and @xmath5he+@xmath1co  @xcite systems .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with dubna data for heavier targets  @xcite .",
    "we should note that contradictory theoretical results have been obtained for @xmath27be+@xmath11bi collisions with a different approach based on the time - dependent wave - packet formalism  @xcite .",
    "the cdcc method  @xcite , which is shown here to be quite succesfull for fusion with stable nuclei , will be used to provide the complete theoretical description of all competing processes ( total fusion , elastic scattering , and breakup ) in a consistent way .",
    "one really needs to investigate such processes in the dynamics of the interaction at the coulomb barrier with loosely bound halo nuclei .",
    "the undertanding of the reaction dynamics involving couplings to the breakup channels requires the explicit measurement of precise elastic scattering data as well as yields leading to the tr ( although tr can not be described within cdcc ) and breakup ( and/or icf ) channels .",
    "the complexity of such reactions , whereby many processes compete on an equal footing , necessitates kinematically and spectroscopically complete measurements , i.e. , ones in which all processes from elastic scattering to cf are measured simultaneously , providing a technical challenge in the design of broad range detection systems .",
    "a new experimental programme with spiral beams and medium - mass targets is underway at ganil within the forthcoming years  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath3he is best described as a three - body @xmath10-@xmath28-@xmath28 object , at present the cdcc method has not yet been completely implemented for four - body breakup  @xcite , its two - body @xmath10-@xmath17n model appears to be rather satisfactory .",
    "the application of four - body cdcc models under current development  @xcite will then be highly desirable .",
    "in the longer term , four - body cdcc models might also be required for @xmath3li , due to the possible sequential breakup of the deuteron .",
    "the questions in the theory of a halo system such as the borromean @xmath3he nucleus , its breakup ( and in the breakup of many - body projectiles generally ) , and its cf and icf processes will need the knowledge not just of those integrated cross sections , but the phase space distributions of the surviving fragment(s ) . therefore , future very exclusive experiments performed at sub - barrier energies will have to determine very precisely the angular correlations of the individual neutrons .",
    "preliminary attempts of measurements  @xcite of @xmath10-particles in coincidence with neutrons are promising to disentangle the effect of halo structures on the reaction mechanisms .",
