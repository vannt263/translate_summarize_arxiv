    "the rashba spin - orbit ( so ) interaction@xcite that occurs in materials without inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for topological insulating or superconducting states and for creating majorana fermions as elementary excitation in a wide variety of systems.@xcite two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-wave topological superconductivity ( tsc ) with rashba so coupling and zeeman field has been proposed to be realised in an ultracold fermi gas , where @xmath0-wave superfluidity and so coupling can be generated , respectively , via the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance and spatially varying laser fields.@xcite 2d @xmath0-wave tsc has also been proposed to be achievable in a solid device made of more conventional materials,@xcite such as a semiconductor with so coupling sandwiched between a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator,@xcite or a semiconductor with rashba and dresselhaus coupling in proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor only.@xcite furthermore , recently developed , one - atom - layer tl - pb compounds on si(111 ) with giant rashba effects@xcite and ionic - liquid based double - layer transistors@xcite are promising candidate systems for realising 2d @xmath0-wave tsc.@xcite in the latter system , for example , the layered structure can consist of an @xmath0-wave superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator , while the electric field controls the charge - carrier density as well as the rashba so interaction.@xcite    in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor , vortices host majorana fermions as zero - energy bound states@xcite and hence obey non - abelian exchange statistics . therefore , creating 2d @xmath0-wave tsc in a condensed matter system , where one has control over key parameters such as the filling factor and the strength of rashba so coupling and/or zeeman field , potentially leads to realisation of fault - tolerant topological quantum computation.@xcite for setups where superconductivity is induced by the proximity effect , in general there have been several arguments@xcite that coupling to the superconductor can renormalise the original parameters , e.g. , on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator and can even be detrimental to the other ingredients necessary for tsc ; although a self - consistent study of the proximity effect@xcite has contradicted some results in this regard in ref .  . it is ideal to have an intrinsic pairing interaction in the system that drives @xmath0-wave superconductivity or superfluidity , as in @xmath0-wave superfluids of fermionic atoms@xcite , one - atom - layer superconducting compounds,@xcite or electric - field double - layer transistors.@xcite    despite the rapid advancement in device fabrication techniques and the 2d @xmath0-wave tsc model@xcite being one of the most promising models for platforms for topological quantum computation , self - consistent studies of this model are severely lacking .",
    "few studies made so far , in which the superconducting order parameter is solved self - consistently , are a momentum - space study of average impurity effects@xcite and studies of a single vortex@xcite and the vortex lattice@xcite in terms of the tight - binding model;@xcite and a study of the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity in an @xmath0-wave superfluid@xcite using the continuum model.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , there has been no work where the hartree potential is solved self - consistently as well .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to perform self - consistent studies of 2d @xmath0-wave tsc by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations@xcite on the tight - binding model of sato , takahashi , and fujimoto@xcite directly and numerically . as a tight - binding model ,",
    "it is versatile in that band structure and the filling factor can easily be adjusted to model real systems in terms of hopping amplitudes and the chemical potential . moreover , unlike the continuum model,@xcite in addition to non - abelian phase this model can host abelian phase where topological order can be realised not only in superconducting states , but also in density wave states.@xcite in this work , we examine the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity and illustrate how the properties of the midgap bound state vary with the material parameters  in stark contrast to the claim made by hu _",
    "et al_.@xcite on `` universal '' midgap bound states . in particular , we find that the midgap excitation bound to a nonmagnetic impurity is spin - polarised@xcite and its spin can flip as the impurity potential is varied .",
    "most notably , we find that a nonmagnetic impurity in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor can act exactly like a magnetic impurity ( classical spin ) in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor , resulting in phase transitions of the ground state .",
    "we also demonstrate that the spin - dependent hartree potential effectively reduces the zeeman field .",
    "furthermore , by solving for the hartree potential as well as the superconducting order parameter self - consistently , we show the existence of topological charge density waves ( tcdw ) as the ground state that is degenerate with tsc at half filling , just as in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "sau and demler@xcite have studied the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity in a semiconductor nanowire with rashba so coupling and zeeman field in proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor,@xcite where one - dimensional ( 1d ) tsc as in kitaev s model can be realised.@xcite by searching for poles in the green function , they found no midgap excitation bound to a nonmagnetic impurity when either one of the rashba so interaction and the zeeman field  the two ingredients required for tsc  was missing .",
    "in tsc states , when the zeeman field is larger than the assumed uniform order parameter , they have found midgap bound states whose energy can cross zero as the strength of the impurity potential is increased .",
    "our self - consistent results for zero - energy crossing of the midgap excitation in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor are similar to their findings ; except that in the 1d system , the impurity cuts the wire in half and creates majorana edge modes in the limit of infinitely strong potential .",
    "we employ the chebyshev polynomial expansion method@xcite for solving the bdg equations self - consistently for the mean fields as well as calculating the local density of states ( ldos ) after self - consistency has been achieved .",
    "this method allows one to obtain self - consistent mean fields without diagonalization of the bdg hamiltonian matrix and it can also gain significant speed - up from parallel computation .",
    "it is thus much more efficient than the traditional way of solving the bdg equations by direct diagonalization , especially when the bdg matrix is spin - dependent and required to be solved for relatively large system size .",
    "we also circumvent the high numerical demand of diagonalizing the bdg matrix by utilising the efficient algorithm of sakurai and sugiura ( ss ) @xcite to obtain the quasiparticle spectrum within a selected energy window .",
    "this numerical technique also benefits greatly from parallelism and if desired , the entire spectrum can be obtained readily by dividing the energy range into smaller subranges and applying the ss method to each subrange .",

    "in summary , by solving for the superconducting order parameter self - consistently , we have found that the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor can vary significantly depending on the material parameters . in particular , the weaker the rashba so coupling , or the stronger the zeeman field , the more @xmath107-wave - like the system reacts to a nonmagnetic impurity .",
    "the midgap excitation bound to the impurity always carries down spin at the impurity site , i.e. , spin antiparallel to the direction of the zeeman field . for relatively strong zeeman field , however , the spin of the midgap excitation can flip as the impurity potential is varied .",
    "we have found two such cases : in one case , the midgap excitation disappears into the gap edge and reappears with opposite spin , and in the other the system undergoes a phase transition of the ground state , whereby the spin - down quasiparticle is bound to the impurity in the ground state and thus the midgap excitation becomes spin up . in this case , a nonmagnetic impurity in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor acts exactly like a magnetic impurity ( classical spin ) in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the spin flip of the quasiparticle excitation can be understood partially in terms of the tknn number that corresponds to the shifted chemical potential at the impurity site having the opposite sign to that of the bulk tknn number .",
    "we have also shown by solving for each spin component of the hartree potential as well as the order parameter self - consistently that the hartree potential effectively reduces the zeeman field .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated in terms of our self - consistent solutions the coexistence of tcdw and tsc in the abelian phase at half filling .",
    "this is analogous to the cdw and uniform superconducting states being the degenerate ground states at half filling in the tight - binding model for conventional @xmath0-wave superconductivity : the presence of a nonmagnetic impurity , however , lifts this degeneracy in favour of cdw.@xcite    in this work , we did not solve for the hartree potential self - consistently when studying the impurity effects .",
    "when the hartree potential is included , the tsc states presented in sec .  [ sec : impurity ] will require weaker pairing interaction and/or so coupling .",

    "<S> most notably , a nonmagnetic impurity in a 2d @xmath0-wave topological superconductor can act like a magnetic impurity in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor , leading to phase transitions of the ground state as the impurity potential is varied . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by solving for the spin - dependent hartree potential self - consistently along with the superconducting order parameter , we demonstrate that topological charge density waves can coexist with tsc at half filling just as in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor . </S>"
