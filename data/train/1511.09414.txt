    "the cosmological principle ( cp ) consists on a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology in which the universe presents neither special directions , nor special positions , is a , ( see , e.g.  @xcite for discussions about this subject ) . in this sense , the success of flrw - based models , such as the @xmath0cdm scenario , in explaining the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations  @xcite , the evolution of large - scale structure of the universe ( lss )  @xcite , as well as the cosmological distances and ages  @xcite , has solidified the cp not as a simplified mathematical hypothesis but as a valid physical assumption .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to test the cp with observational data not only for the sake of probing one of the underpinning assumptions of cosmology , but also for correctly interpreting the mechanism behind cosmic acceleration and structure formation .    however , there are claims of possible statistical isotropy violation in large scales , where many of them are ascribed to the features in cmb temperature fluctuations data such as low multipole alignments , hemispherical power asymmetries , lack of angular correlations at large scales , and the presence of a non - gaussian cold spot  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of very large velocity flows when compared reference value of velocity of our relative motion toward the cmb obtained by  @xcite , that is , @xmath1 , were suggested ( to some controversy ) by kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect analyses using galaxy clusters  @xcite , or by anomalously large number count dipoles found in high-@xmath2 radio sources maps  @xcite , thus posing potential challenges for the isotropy assumption as well .",
    "the possibility of anisotropy in the cosmological expansion were also investigated with type ia supernovae luminosity distance  @xcite , yet no significant result supporting this possibility has been detected so far .    in the light of these puzzles , the validity of the cp must be put under scrutiny with the latest observational data , since any other detected violation of its underlying hypotheses would reinforce the demand of a complete reformulation of the standard cosmological scenario . a direct method to test isotropy consists on searching for a dipole asymmetry , or directional anomalous features in the angular distribution of cosmic objects , once they are projected on the celestial sphere .",
    "the second release of planck sunyaev - zeldovich ( psz2 ) catalogue  @xcite provides an ideal sample for this purpose since it comprises over 1600 galaxy clusters ( gcs ) in a wide sky coverage ( @xmath3 ) , besides a deep redshift range ( @xmath4 ) , hence the most complete all - sky gcs set by the current moment .",
    "as these objects are good representatives of the matter distribution of the universe , they should not exhibit directional dependence of their projected distribution in the sky .",
    "so , any anomalous signal of this nature , such as regions presenting excess of correlations ( clustering ) or anti - correlations ( voids ) in the gcs angular distribution , are suggestive of violation of the cosmological isotropy assumption ( and hence a violation of the cp ) , unless explained by limited sky coverage , and systematics , of the observational sample .    therefore , we analyse the statistical isotropy of the psz2 sources by carrying out a hemispherical comparison , based on the 2-point angular correlation function , through the celestial sphere",
    ". the statistical significance of this analysis is estimated with synthetic monte carlo realisations that account for the cut - sky gcs maps around the galactic plane , besides the sky exposure of planck s observational strategy , as they could explain the existence of over - dense and under - dense source distribution in some patches of the sky .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section 2 is dedicated to the preparation of the data set we adopt throughout this work , section 3 discusses the methodology developed to carry out the statistical isotropy analysis of the gcs angular distribution , and finally our results and final remarks are presented in section 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "our analyses are performed with the psz2 catalogue named union ( henceforth _ psz2-union _ ) , which has been downloaded from the irsa website .",
    "this set encompasses gcs compiled from three combined detection methods based on neural network algorithms .",
    "the main systematics of this data set consists on spurious infra - red contamination , besides the limitation of neural algorithm failure in the gcs detection .",
    "hence , we apply the following queries on the psz2-union original catalogue :    * @xmath5 , * @xmath6 , * @xmath7 .",
    "the first two queries eliminate 180 of 1654 objects , already providing a sample purity of 85% , whereas the last one reduces the sample to 1066 gcs .",
    "while redshift is not the main source of uncertainty , we note that the exclusion of the gcs with no redshift determination contributes to increase the overall signal - to - noise ( @xmath8 ) of their detection , hence comprising the most reliable sources of the catalogue ) in @xmath9 ) , that has been constructed by the planck team to constrain cosmological parameters such as @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "we do not focus on this sample as our goal is to test the isotropy assumption with the largest set possible in terms of data points , besides sky coverage , yet it gives similar results to the larger psz2-union set . ] . the final sample we use throughout this paper",
    "is exhibited as black dots in the left panel of figure  [ fig : map_mask ] , and whose corresponding foreground mask appears in the right panel .",
    "as previously mentioned , the available celestial area for our analysis , in order to avoid spurious contamination due to dust thermal emission , is @xmath3",
    "here we describe the angular - distribution estimator which leads to quantify deviations from statistical isotropy in a given set of cosmic events with known positions on the celestial sphere  @xcite .",
    "our primary purpose is to illustrate the procedure for defining the discrete function @xmath12 on the celestial sphere in order to generate its associated map , called @xmath13map or sigma - map .",
    "then , one compares the sigma - map obtained from the data catalogue with a large set of sigma - maps generated from statistically isotropic simulated ensembles in order to assess a measure of ( possible ) deviation from statistical isotropy in the dataset in analysis .",
    "let @xmath14 be a spherical cap region on the celestial sphere , of @xmath15 degrees of radius , centered at the @xmath16-th pixel , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the angular coordinates of the center of the @xmath16-th pixel .",
    "both , the number of spherical caps @xmath19 and the coordinates of their center @xmath18 are defined using the healpix pixelization scheme  @xcite .",
    "the spherical caps are such that their union completely covers the celestial sphere @xmath20 .",
    "we assume galactic coordinates throughout our analyses .",
    "let @xmath21 be the catalogue of cosmic objects located in the @xmath16-th spherical cap @xmath22 .",
    "the 2-point angular correlation function ( 2pacf ) of these objects  @xcite , denoted as @xmath23 , is the difference between the normalised frequency distribution and that expected from the number of pairs - of - objects with angular distances in the interval @xmath24,\\ , i=1,\\ldots , n_{\\mbox{\\tiny bins}}$ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the bin width .",
    "the expected distribution is the average of normalized frequency distributions obtained from a large number of simulated realisations of isotropically distributed objects in @xmath20 , containing the same number of objects as in the dataset in analysis .",
    "this 2pacf estimator is nothing else than the well known @xmath27 , termed _ natural _ estimator in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath28 indicates that objects with these angular separations are correlated ( anti - correlated ) , while zero indicates no correlation .",
    "let us define now the scalar function @xmath29 , for @xmath17 , which assigns to the @xmath16-cap , centered at @xmath18 , a real positive number @xmath30 .",
    "we define a measure @xmath12 of the angular correlations in the @xmath16-cap as    @xmath31    to obtain a quantitative measure of the angular correlation signatures of the gc s sky map , we choose @xmath32 and cover the celestial sphere with @xmath33 hemispheres , then calculate the set of values @xmath34 using eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "patching together the set @xmath35 in the celestial sphere according to a coloured scale ( where , for instance , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) we obtain a sigma - map .",
    "we quantify the angular correlation signatures of a given sigma - map from a data set by calculating its angular power spectrum .",
    "similar power spectra are calculated , for comparison , with isotropically distributed samples of cosmic objects .",
    "since the sigma - map assigns a real number value to each pixel in the celestial sphere , that is , @xmath38 , it is possible expand it in spherical harmonics : @xmath39 where the set of values @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 , is the angular power spectrum of the sigma - map .",
    "because we are interested in the large - scale angular correlations , we shall concentrate on @xmath42 , i.e. , scales larger than @xmath43 in the sky .",
    "the statistical significance of our sigma - map analyses is evaluated with monte carlo ( mcs ) realisations .",
    "we shall compare the gcs angular distribution from the psz2 catalogue with a set of 500 purely isotropic data set with the same available area as the real data , termed _",
    "mcs iso_. the first step to produce this set of simulated data , the _ mcs iso _",
    ", is to know how many points one has to generate in the whole celestial sphere .",
    "the number of gcs of the psz2 catalogue in the masked sky is @xmath44 , which implies that the number of gcs to be observed in any full - sky simulation should be 17% larger because @xmath3 .",
    "this results in that @xmath45 data points should be simulated in any full - sky mc realisation .",
    "the second step consists on generating , for each mc map , 1284 pairs of angular coordinates @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , \\phi \\in [ 0 , 2\\pi]$ ] , with @xmath48 , l \\in [ 0 , 2\\pi]$ ] , where ( 0,0 ) is the galactic centre . ] .",
    "let @xmath49 , \\ , n=1,\\cdots 1284 $ ] , be a uniformly distributed random real number , then an ensemble of pairs of random numbers @xmath50 produce an ensemble of pairs of angular coordinates corresponding to isotropically distributed gcs : @xmath51 .",
    "for details of how to produce maps with isotropically distributed points and how to test the statistical isotropy there see  @xcite ( regarding the theoretical expected function of the estimator @xmath27 see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the last step of this procedure is to apply the cut - sky mask to all of these simulated maps .",
    "after that we have to produce a second set of mcs , that is , an ensemble of 500 mcs which takes the non - uniform sky exposure ( nuse ) function of the planck satellite , as featured in figure  [ fig : nuse ] , into account .",
    "this is performed by weighting the number of data points according to the right panel of this figure , as the experiment had visited some regions of the sky more often than others , so that there is a higher probability that a larger amount of gcs have been detected toward these bright celestial regions than the others , which could potentially bias our assessment of gcs isotropy due to this effect , which could bias the final map . ] .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite showed that the nuse function can explain small departures from isotropy observed in the batse short gamma - ray bursts angular distribution , which disagrees with previous results that did not consider such effect , and found a remarkable anisotropy in such distribution .",
    "these synthetic realisations are henceforth referred as _ mcs aniso _",
    ", so that we compare the psz2-union sigma - map with both mc ensembles in order to estimate its directional variance given the limitations , i.e. , the nuse and foreground mask , that are intrinsic to the data , and could lead to a false anisotropic signal when unaccounted .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : sigmamap ] depicts , for illustrative reasons , the 2pacf @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ) obtained in two hemispheres along the angular distance @xmath53 from the hemisphere centre .",
    "the hemispheres @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as indicated in this panel as the blue and red curves , respectively , correspond to those where the maximal and minimal sigma - map values ( where the sigma - map denotes the sum of the square of this @xmath56 over all these @xmath53 ) have been attained , respectively .",
    "it is noticeable that the angular correlations fluctuates much more in the former case , hence indicating larger angular correlations ( and anti - correlations ) in the gcs distribution comprised in this region .",
    "when approximating the sigma - map results obtained through the whole celestial sphere as a dipole , we obtain a direction whose maximal value is located towards the north - western patch of the sky , and thereby the minimal points towards the south - east . even though this direction resembles the maximal cmb power asymmetry localisation , we are unable to ascribe this signal to any of these features in a statistically significant manner .",
    "thus , we report no signature of a preferred direction in the psz2-union map that could be associated with the aforementioned cmb feature , as well as the dipole associated to the hubble flow .",
    "moreover , the results of the sigma - map analyses in the form of the angular power spectrum , @xmath57 , are displayed as black crosses in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sigmamap ] .",
    "the red curve denotes the sigma - map results of 500 _ mcs aniso _ and , on the other hand , the blue curve represents the mean spectra obtained from idealistic isotropic maps that accounts only for the mask . in each case , the central values are given by their arithmetic average , while their spreads correspond the mean absolute deviation ( mad ) of these simulated data sets .",
    "the use of mad , instead of the standard deviation ( std ) , is due to the fact that the @xmath57 s of these 500 mcs are very skewed to the right , i.e. , they present a long - tailed distribution , therefore , the mad gives a more robust estimation of their uncertainty around their mean value than the std .",
    "we note that the psz2-union sigma - map behavior is much closer to the average of 500 _ mcs aniso _ than the purely isotropic realisations , yet the multipole moments @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , corresponding to the angular scales @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively , are slightly in tension with them . such mild discrepancies could be ascribed to some unnacounted features in the data besides the anisotropic exposure function , and the incompleteness of the sky coverage , such as possible impurities and contamination that have not been detected in our quality tests , or even planck team s .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that these _ mcs aniso _ give the upper limit of the possible amount of anisotropy in each angular scale because of these selection effects , and since the apparent gcs distribution anisotropy matches this predicition in most of the angular scales probed , we conclude that no anisotropy other than those coming from selection effects has been revealed , and hence these data are in good agreement with the statistical isotropy hypothesis underlying the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the variety and robustness of current cosmological data provide the possibility of testing some fundamental hypotheses of the standard cosmological model .",
    "one of these hypotheses is the validity of the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy on very large scales . in this work",
    ", the cosmological isotropy of the large - scale structure of the universe has been tested with the largest all - sky catalogue of gcs present in the literature , psz2-union , released by the planck collaboration  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we mapped the angular distribution of gcs through the celestial sphere using a geometrical and statistical test , named sigma - map analysis , which only depends on the coordinates where the cosmic objects are located ( in other words , this means that it does not depend on any cosmological model assumption ) in the sky if the assumption of large - scale isotropy is actually valid .",
    "accordingly , any departure from statistical isotropy of the data would be revealed by departures of the sigma - map power spectrum when compared with the mean simulated spectra .",
    "since we have probed large angular scales , @xmath63 , such discrepancy would suggest a possible failure of the cp as a valid assumption to describe the cosmic web .",
    "the sigma - map analysis show that there is no statistically significance indication for anomalous clustering in the psz2-union catalogue , and hence we report no suggestion for violation of statistical isotropy that might be , for instance , possible linked with the cmb features , or large - scale velocity flows , that we previously discussed . as a matter of fact , the sigma - map multipole decomposition , via @xmath64 s , shows that there is good agreement between the real data and the mc realisations in large angular scales ( @xmath65 ) once its hemispherical variance can be explained only in terms of the incomplete sky coverage , and the sky exposure , of the data .    finally , our main conclusion is that the large - scale structure is in a good agreement with the fundamental assumption of cosmic isotropy in large angular scales",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that it is crucial to repeat and provide new tests of such fundamental hypothesis with current data , and specially with future catalogues .",
    "for instance , erosita  @xcite is expected to provide an all - sky sample of @xmath66 , thus , it may enormously enhance the precision of the test carried out in this work .",
    "furthermore , the prospect of much larger data sets of different cosmic objects , e.g. , galaxies , radio sources , or supernovae , that future missions such as euclid  @xcite , lsst  @xcite and ska  @xcite are expected to deliver , would enable us to test not only the isotropy , but the homogeneity assumption as well , with unprecedented precision .",
