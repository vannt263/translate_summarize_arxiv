    "<S> the time integral from the pulse over one period of oscillation must be negative to obtain deceleration and positive to obtain hyperacceleration . </S>",

    "<S> the displacement of the moving wall is ignored , the modulus function is used to avoid errors due to successive collisions which may occur in the original model . in other words , if after a collision with the wall the particle continues to have a negative velocity ( a successive collision will occur in the original model ) , the particle moves beyond the wall . </S>",

    "<S> these regular islands prevent the particle velocity to increase very fast . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to mention that all initial conditions start inside the chaotic region at low velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate of @xmath22 depends on the number of regular islands inside the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this is an expected results since this case is similar to the simplified model studied by lichtenberg and lieberman  @xcite , where the harmonic force was considered . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting behavior appears when the deformed sawtooth is introduced . for a very small asymmetry @xmath36 ( case @xmath15 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the phase space is totally filled and no regular islands are observed [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocity](c ) ] . the corresponding @xmath22 increases </S>",
    "<S> very fast until @xmath37 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocity](d ) ] , showing that the accelerated mode is enhanced ( hyperaccelerated ) when compared to the case @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> another kind of motion occurs when @xmath38 ( case @xmath13 ) where many regular islands appear in phase space [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocity](e ) ] which again prevent the acceleration to increase without bounds , as in case @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath22 remains almost constant for this example [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocity](f ) ] . a relevant property of case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is that : if the initial condition for the velocity is very high , the particle is decelerated . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the hyperaccelerated particles from case @xmath13 start to decelerate up to the time they reach the regular islands from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocity](e ) , but now from above . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a regular island barrier which prevents particles to decelerated until zero for short times . </S>",
    "<S> for very long times , however , particles may pass between the regular islands and decelerate to zero velocities . </S>",
    "<S> such motion close to regular islands may lead to `` sticky '' or trapped  @xcite trajectories which affect the velocity and the convergency of the finite time lyapunov exponents  @xcite .    in order to explain the effect of the deformed sawtooth pulse , we rewrite maps ( [ map_1 ] ) and ( [ map_2 ] ) in the very high velocity regime ( @xmath39 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution for the phase can be neglected and we have    @xmath40    from this expression for the velocity , we clearly see that when @xmath12 the velocity is reduced by each iteration and the decelerated mode is obtained . when @xmath10 the velocity is constant and when @xmath14 the velocity increases without bounds and we get the hyperaccelerated case .    </S>",
    "<S> the above illustration shows the importance of a small deformation in the sawtooth wall motion on the dynamics in phase space and on the corresponding acceleration . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath13 , the @xmath43 is almost constant , increasing very slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the time behavior of the mean le in case @xmath13 is similar to the mean le from the @xmath11 case in the following sense : the trajectory is trapped in the specific chaotic region in the phase space , below the islands of regularity [ please compare figs .  </S>",

    "<S> figure [ control ] shows the time evolution of the particle velocity using a combination of cases @xmath50 discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> while for the case @xmath15 the hyperaccelerated mode is obtained , the case @xmath13 is able to decelerated the particle velocity . </S>",
    "<S> when the desirable velocity is reached , the wall oscillation can be turned off ( case @xmath49 ) . by appropriately switching the ratchetlike pulse between @xmath50 modes </S>",
    "<S> , the velocity can be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that the control is only possible due to the following particular property of the decelerated mode : the deceleration only occurs after the particle is hyperaccelerated , it does not occur for small velocities [ see fig .  [ velocity](e ) ] ) .    to conclude , for a long time the fermi acceleration has been studied in different models and applications @xcite </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these works ( but one @xcite ) considered the possibility to control the particles in order to achieve a desirable velocity . here </S>",
    "<S> we show the effect of a _ deformed _ sawtooth ( ratchetlike ) pulse to control the particle velocity in the fermi - ulam model . changing the asymmetry parameter from the ratchetlike pulse we are able to get fermi hyperacceleration and deceleration . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the time integral of the pulse ( the wall position ) over one period of oscillation must be different from zero in order to get the control . when the mentioned integral is positive ( negative ) , the fermi hyperacceleration ( deceleration ) occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to , by switching the pulse between hyperacceleration and deceleration modes , to control the particles velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the decelerated and normal accelerated cases are chaotic , while for the hyperaccelerated case the les converge to zero . </S>",
    "<S> additionally we give numerical evidences which indicate that the hyperaccelerated case is ergodic in velocity space . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to observe the deformed sawtooth pulse to control the particle velocity in the presence of dissipation @xcite . </S>"
