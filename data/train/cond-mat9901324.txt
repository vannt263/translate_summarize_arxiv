    "the spin excitation spectra im@xmath7 of high-@xmath8 superconductors is extensively studied by inelastic neutron scattering(ins ) and a consistent picture has emerged in yba@xmath2cu@xmath5o@xmath9(ybco ) .",
    "a remarkable feature in both underdoped and highly doped ybco is that a sharp neutron resonance peak was observed in the superconducting state(sc ) at a 2d wave vector * q*=@xmath10[1 - 4 ] .",
    "also , in the sc state , im@xmath7 is restricted to a small energy range limited by a doping dependent energy gap(spin gap ) in low frequencies and has sinusoidal dependence on @xmath11 , the wave vector perpendicular to the cuo@xmath2 planes  @xcite .",
    "both the resonance peak and the spin gap disappear in the normal state , and the resonance energy e@xmath12 is found to increases monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8  @xcite , therefore they appear to be correlated to the superconductivity .",
    "a number of theories has been proposed to account for this magnetic resonance . beyond different modifications",
    ", one may basically divide the explanations into two classes .",
    "first , it may result from the spin - flip quasiparticle scatterings across the sc gap , causing an enhancement of the electronic spin susceptibility at a specific energy which compensates for the loss of spectral weight below the gap .",
    "second , it may be a consequence of a collective mode in the particle - particle channel which couples to neutron scattering through the particle - hole(@xmath13 ) mixing in the d - wave sc state  @xcite .",
    "more particularly , the first class includes i ) a bcs gap function wth strong coulomb correlations  @xcite and a non - bcs gap function resulting from the interlayer pair tunneling theory of high-@xmath8 superconductivity  @xcite , in the framework of a d - wave pairing model .",
    "ii ) a s - wave order parameter with opposite signs in bounding and antibounding bands formed within the cuo@xmath2 bilayer  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it was shown that the superconducting properties are modified by nonmagnetic impurities , especially @xmath8 is rapidly suppressed by the substitution of the copper ions by zinc ions  @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of these results is made in term of a @xmath0 order parameter affected by nonmagnetic scattering , assuming that zn acts as a strong resonant scatterer  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "nonmagnetic impurities have a strong pair breaking effect  @xcite and will modify the spin excitation spectra observed in sc state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the modifications of the resonance peak and the spin gap upon the introduction of nonmagnetic impurites in a bcs @xmath0 superconductor .",
    "we treat the impurities in the dilute limit using the self - consistent @xmath1-matrix approximation  @xcite .",
    "both the impurity self - energy effects and the impurity vertex corrections are considered in our calculations . in the pure system ,",
    "a sharp magnetic peak is observed and the spectrum is limited by the spin gap in low frequencies . when the impurity self - energy corrections are considered , we find that the peak is broadened and its position is shifted to lower energies",
    ". meanwhile , the magnitude of the spin gap decreases but only a negligible contribution to the spin excitation spectrum is found in the gap due to the impurity self - energy corrections . on the other hand , the vertex corrections alone induce a broad spectral weight in the spin gap at the impurity concentration where no clear reasonance peak is observed , and have only slight effect on both the peak and the magnitude of the spin gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we discuss the model and study the self - energy corrections .",
    "sec.iii contains the effect of the vertex corrections .",
    "we present the conclusion in sec.iv",
    "to consider the modulation of the spin susceptibility along the @xmath14 axis , we investigate a bilayer system with a interlayer hopping @xmath15 and the same @xmath0 order parameter in two layers .",
    "the effects of antiferromagnetic correlations within and between the layers are considered in the random - phase approximation(rpa ) form of the susceptibility .",
    "the nambu green s function of single particles for the pure system in the sc state is given by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pauli matrices , @xmath18 or @xmath19 expresses the antibonding or bonding band .",
    "for the quasiparticle dispersion , we use @xmath20 \\pm t_{\\perp } -\\mu$ ] , with @xmath21 corresponding to a fit to the angle - resolved photoemission data on the optimal doping ybco as used before  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is chosen as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the sc transition temperature .",
    "the nonmagnetic impurities are modeled by a zero - range potential @xmath25 and its scattering is treated in the self - consistent @xmath1-matrix approximation  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "two parameters are introduced to describe the scattering process : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the density of states at the fermi level and the impurity concentration .",
    "the impurity - average nambu green s function @xmath30 for single particles can be written formally as  @xcite , @xmath31 the tilde symbol represents inclusion of the impurity self - energy corrections , @xmath32 where we have used the fact that the off - diagonal self - energy @xmath33 vanishes for a @xmath0 symmetry of the gap function . in the single - site approximation ,",
    "the self - energy is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the impurity - scattering @xmath1-matrix @xmath35 can be calculated from  @xcite , @xmath36^{2 } } , \\",

    "the following calculations are carried out in the unitary limit , @xmath38 , so only the @xmath39 contribution remains .",
    "the order parameter @xmath40 and the sc transition temperature @xmath8 in the presence of impurities are determined from the gap equation . in the weak - coupling limit",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath41 and @xmath42 draw almost the same curve as a function of @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the temperature - dependence of @xmath45 is taken to be , @xmath46 where @xmath8 is given by the abrikosov - gorkov formula  @xcite , @xmath47 with @xmath48 the digamma function .    the spin susceptibility for matsubara frequencies",
    "is calculated from , @xmath49 .\\ ] ] its analytic continuation to the real frequency , giving @xmath50 , is performed using pad@xmath51 approximants  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath52 is replaced by @xmath53 , eq.(7 ) gives the result for the pure system .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations in the plane @xmath54 and between the planes @xmath55 would renormalize @xmath56 .",
    "this effect is considered in rpa approximation  @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the susceptibility described above comes from the @xmath13 excitations of quasiparticles within and between the bonding and antibonding bands . however , the susceptibility @xmath60 observed in the neutron scattering is related to the excitations of quasiparticles within and between the layers  @xcite .",
    "the relation between them can be obtained using the transformation matrix between the states in the layer and band representations .",
    "it gives , @xmath61 , \\",

    "then we have , @xmath65 eq.(10 ) implies that the experimentally observed @xmath66 modulation of the ins comes from the transitions of quasiparticles between the respective bands .    in following evaluations ,",
    "the summation over @xmath67 and @xmath68 are performed by dividing the brillouin zone into 1024@xmath691024 lattices and by summing from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in matsubara frequency @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the number of input points in pad@xmath51 approximant is chosen to be 100 and @xmath73 to be 0.85 in unit of @xmath1(we will use this unit in the following ) .",
    "in addition , we take @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "results for im@xmath76 versus @xmath77 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the continuous line corresponds to the pure system which reproduces the observed ins features in the sc state .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) lines are results with the impurity self - energy corrections . to understand the impurity effect ,",
    "let us first address the origin of the peak for the pure system within the @xmath62-wave bcs framework , which has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a qualitative statement , let @xmath78 , and set the coherence factor to unity , then one has im@xmath79 .",
    "the energy @xmath80 which is the function of the 2d wave vector @xmath67 has a minimum at @xmath81 , corresponding to both @xmath82 and @xmath83 near the crossings of the fermi surface and the magnetic brillouin zone . at the minimum im@xmath84",
    "has a step and correspondingly re@xmath84 has a logarithmic singularity . in the realistic calculations ,",
    "this divergence exhibits a maximum as shown in fig.2 and causes a resonant peak due to the rpa renormalization eq.(8 ) .",
    "meanwhile , there is a saddle point at @xmath85 in the quasiparticle dispersion , and it leads to a logarithmic divergence in im@xmath84 .",
    "it arises from the transitions between the occupied states located at @xmath85 and empty states above the sc gap , thus the peak position locates at @xmath86 . for the dispersion of quasiparticles considered here , the van hove singularity of the antibonding band at @xmath85 lies at an energy @xmath87 relative to the fermi level and that of the bonding band is @xmath88 due to splitting of the two bands .",
    "it gives @xmath89 , which is close to the energy where re@xmath90 is divergent , therefore enhances the peak .",
    "in fact , these two effects are indistinguishable in the calculations and exhibits only one peak in im@xmath84 as can be seen in fig.2 .",
    "now , we turn to the impurity effects on the spin excitation spectra . in a @xmath62-wave superconductor with resonant nonmagnetic impurity scattering , the sc gap @xmath91 is suppressed  @xcite and causes the shift of the peak , which is basically equal to @xmath92 as discussed above , to low frequencies . meanwhile",
    ", the impurity scattering causes the decays of quasiparticle states and leads to the damping of spin excitaitons associated with im@xmath84 .",
    "it gives rise to the broadening of the peak .",
    "exactly this bahavior is observed in fig.1 .",
    "also one can see from fig.2 that the peak in im@xmath84 disappears gradually upon the introduction of impurities .",
    "it is because the impurity scattering will wash out the van hove singularity .",
    "consequently , no clear reasonance peak is observed at large impurity concentrations ( e.g.@xmath93 ) due to this effect and the damping of spin excitations .",
    "another feature in fig.1 is that no significant excitation spectrum weight has been found in the spin gap .",
    "the origin of the spin gap in the sc state arises from a lack of thermally exciting @xmath13 pairs across the sc gap with transition wavevector @xmath94 when the exciting energy is lower than the threshold @xmath95 .",
    "so , though the impurity self - energy produces an increase in the quasiparticle scattering rate , it may be not strong enough to cause an observeable enhancement to the @xmath13 excitations across the sc gap .",
    "we note that the impurity vertex corrections entering im@xmath84 consist of the @xmath13 ladder diagrams connected by the impurity scatteing lines , which may allow a strong scatterings and lead to singificant modification of the spin gap .",
    "in the above calculations , the self - energy from the impurity scattering is considered to include the multiple scattering of quasiparticles from the same impurity in the noncrossing manner  @xcite . because the dynamical susceptibility measured in magnetic neutron scattering is believed here to come from the @xmath13 pair excitations , the multiple scattering of particles and holes from the same impurity should be examined .",
    "that is , we must include the vertex corrections due to the impurity scattering , which is displayed diagrammatically in fig.3 .",
    "the single and double arrowed solid lines in fig.3 stand for the normal and pairing green s functions of particles and holes renormalized by the impurity self - energy .",
    "the dashed line is the impurity interaction and the impurity is represented by a cross @xmath96 .",
    "the multiple scatterings in the form of ladder diagrams and the multiple scatterings of quasiparticles from the same impurity can be explicitly seen from fig.3 ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the vertex - corrected spin susceptibility can be written as a @xmath97 matrix equation  @xcite , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the dressed vertex and the impurity - scattering lines are given by , @xmath100^{2 } } t^{(i)}_{0}(i\\omega_{m}+i\\omega_{n})t^{(j)}_{0}(i\\omega_{n } ) .\\ ] ] the spin - triplet particle - particle channel into the @xmath13 bubbles by transfroming e.g. a spin - down particle into a spin - up hole and vice versa via the mixing with the sc condensate is not included here , because its contributions to rpa normalized spin susceptibility is zero when one considers the af correlations in the form of that in @xmath101 model  @xcite .",
    "thus , the components of @xmath102 are , @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the normal and paring green s functions of quasiparticles which has been renormalized by the impurity self - energy .",
    "the equations ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are calculated by using the same method described in sec.ii .",
    "results for im@xmath76 are shown in fig.4 for the same impurity concentrations as those in fig.1 .",
    "in contrast to the effect of self - energy corrections , an apparent contribution to spin excitation spectra is observed in the spin gap at large impurity concentrations where no clear reasonance peak is observed . in order to separate the contribution of vertex corrections from self - energy corrections ,",
    "we have carried out the similar calculations in which the green s functions of the impurity - free system in @xmath107 are used .",
    "the result shows that the signal in the spin gap is solely due to the vertex corrections , meanwhile the magnitude of the spin gap as well as the position and the width of the peak remain unchanged , except for a slight enhancement of the peak height in the presence of only vertex corrections . the broad contribution in the spin gap",
    "may be understood as the strong scattering involved in the impurity vertex which allows for the multiple scatterings due to ladder diagrams . to address the reason why this strong scattering takes effect mainly in low frequencies , we show in fig.5 the decay rates of the quasiparticles due to the impurity self - energy implied by @xmath108 .",
    "the similar result has been obtained by quinland and scalapino  @xcite .",
    "we can see that the decay rates increase as the frequency decreases and reache its maximum at @xmath109 . because the impurity - scattering lines in the vertex corrections is directly related to @xmath110 as expressed in eq.(12 ) , this enhancement is amplified by the multiple scatterings in the form of ladder diagrams .",
    "we note that , in the absence of the vertex corrections , this enhancement is not strong enough to lead to an apparent spectral weight in the gap as discussed in sec.ii . from fig.4 , we can also see that the gaplike region in low frequencies still retains in the impurity - doping system .",
    "we may ascribe it to the fact that the off - diagonal impurity self - energy @xmath111 vanishes identically for a @xmath0 order parameter and therefore the angular ( e.g.nodal ) structure of the sc gap is not changed . according to these features , we find that the overall modifications of the spin excitation spectra upon the doping of nonmagnetic impurity are in qualitatively consistent with the ins measurement on yba@xmath2(cu@xmath112zn@xmath113)@xmath5o@xmath6  @xcite . however , the spectral weight in the spin gap is still not large enough to account for quantitatively the experimental result  @xcite .",
    "we note that a nonmagnetic impurity such as zn in the cuo@xmath2 planes is believed to induce a local magnetic moment and lead to additional spin - flip scattering  @xcite . from the above discussion",
    ", we think that this scattering may lead to more significant spectral weight in the spin gap than that given here .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed investigation of this effect is required and will be carried out in future .",
    "we have calculated the spin excitation spectra below @xmath8 for a model @xmath0-wave superconductor with resonant impurity scattering .",
    "the impurity self - energy corrections shift the position of the resonance peak to low frequencies and broaden the peak . as the impurity concentration increases",
    ", the resonance peak disappears gradually .",
    "when no clear reasonance peak is observed , the impurity vertex corrections cause a broad contribution to the excitation spectra in the spin gap , but the memory of the spin gap still retains . thus , impurity - scatterings , together with the vertex corrections , account for qualitatively the experimental measurement on zn - doping yba@xmath2cu@xmath5o@xmath9 .",
