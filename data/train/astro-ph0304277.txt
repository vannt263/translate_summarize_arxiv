    "the search for an explanation for the observed acceleration of the universe  @xcite is one of the most important challenges in contemporary cosmology .",
    "one usually assumes the existence of a dark energy component which breaks the strong energy condition , and the simplest model that one can build is that of introducing a cosmological constant . yet , in order to obtain its domination today it has to be precisely set to an extremely small and so far unexplained value , one manifestation of the cosmological constant problem  @xcite . more generally , the fact that the dark energy overtakes dark matter at a recent epoch ( @xmath0 ) when we cosmologists are able to observe it is known as the coincidence problem .",
    "allowing the dark energy to be dynamical may help to solve this issue . in this respect , a light scalar field , known as quintessence  @xcite , has been proposed .",
    "the field is meant to slow - roll down its potential , with its potential energy acting analogously to that of early universe inflation . a wide class of tracker models  @xcite feature an attractor solution which roughly mimics the behaviour of the dominant component of the universe , rendering the evolution of the field fairly independent of its initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately , in order to obtain quintessence domination today , the parameters of the potentials so far discussed also need a fine - tuning , and so as yet those models have not led to a compelling resolution of the coincidence problem .",
    "more recently , models based on scalar fields with non - canonical kinetic energy  @xcite , dubbed as k - essence  @xcite , have emerged .",
    "a subclass of models  @xcite feature a tracker behaviour during radiation domination , and a cosmological - constant - like behaviour shortly after the transition to matter domination .",
    "as long as this transition seems to occur generically for purely dynamical reasons , these models are claimed to solve the coincidence problem without fine - tuning .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze the models given in the literature so far  @xcite .",
    "we will study the size of the basin of attraction of their tracker solutions and comment on the fine - tuning of the parameters .",
    "we will also look at the behaviour of a general k - essence field close to singularities corresponding to a diverging sound speed .    throughout this article a prime",
    "denotes a derivative with respect to the argument of the function to which it is applied , and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to proper time .",
    "we assume @xmath1 .",
    "in general k - essence is defined as a scalar field with non - canonical kinetic energy , but usually the models are restricted to the lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the definition includes quintessence models ( in this paper meaning scalar fields with canonical kinetic term ) . using the perfect fluid analogy ,",
    "the pressure and the energy density are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we set @xmath7 , define a new variable @xmath8 and re - express @xmath9 as @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the pressure and the energy density become @xmath11 we assume @xmath12 , hence @xmath13 .",
    "the equation of state parameter and the effective sound speed are given by @xmath14 we also assume @xmath15 and @xmath16 which implies @xmath17 . as a result",
    ", @xmath18 must be a convex and decreasing function of @xmath19 .",
    "from now on , we consider a flat robertson  walker universe defined by the metric @xmath20 in this case , the euler  lagrange equation for the k - essence field is @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "then , if the universe is filled with another fluid with energy density @xmath23 and equation of state parameter @xmath24 constant one can find the following system of equations in terms of the independent variables @xmath19 and @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 here , we have assumed that @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the dynamics is completely described by trajectories in the @xmath19@xmath25 plane . as long as @xmath33 the system is well defined .",
    "as we can see , @xmath34 is a stationary point if @xmath35 and @xmath36 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this is a stable point  and therefore corresponds to a perfect tracking ( @xmath37 ) of the dominant fluid  if @xmath38 .",
    "as we will see , for the particular class of models we will analyze , we have @xmath39 for some @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath41 and that the sound speed diverges at @xmath40 . in that case , from eq .",
    "( [ dybydn ] ) we see that at @xmath42 there is a unique possible value @xmath43 given by the constraint equation @xmath44 this means that the phase space @xmath19@xmath25 is cut into ( at least ) two parts separated by the line @xmath42 which is not allowed by the model except at @xmath45 . to study the dynamics close to this line we use the expansion @xmath46 with @xmath47 , compute eq .",
    "( [ dybydn ] ) to @xmath48 and find the equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 if @xmath51 , eq .  ( [ perturbation ] ) allows us to study the behaviour of the field close to the line @xmath42 , and unless @xmath52 the first term dominates . for the particular class of models we will analyze we have @xmath53 , and therefore if @xmath54 , hence @xmath55 , the solution moves away from the line , whereas if @xmath56 the solution ceases to exist ( in that it hits the singularity @xmath40 ) within a finite time @xmath57 as it approaches the line ( this has been checked numerically ) .",
    "we define @xmath58 as the segment of the singularity from which some trajectories spontaneously emerge and @xmath59 as the segment of the singularity on which some trajectories abruptly end .",
    "we can also use eq .",
    "( [ perturbation ] ) to determine the nature of the perturbation @xmath60 at the regular point @xmath61 . in that case",
    "the equation simplifies to give @xmath62 depending on the value of @xmath63 this solution either grows or decreases exponentially fast . in the cases we will study here",
    ", we have @xmath64 and therefore @xmath60 decreases .",
    "the existence of this singular behaviour means that a diverging sound speed leads to serious problems . in some situations it may well be possible to argue that the theory is valid up to a certain cut - off which excludes the singularity , but as we will show this is not the case for the cosmologically - realistic models proposed so far  @xcite",
    ". instead ,",
    "in these situations we must deal with the singular regions as we meet them .",
    "k - essence models can possess many different attractor solutions  @xcite , especially trackers which perfectly mimic the dominant component of the universe and attractors with negative equation of state leading to domination of the field . by choosing an appropriate function @xmath18 , it is possible to build a model with a certain number of attractor solutions which can feature some interesting dynamical properties .",
    "for instance , a stable tracker solution during radiation domination ( @xmath65 ) could render the late - time evolution of the field fairly independent of its initial conditions .",
    "then , the lack of such a solution during matter domination would force the field to reach another pseudo - attractor with @xmath66 leading to the k - essence domination attractor ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this possibility was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in that sense it is possible to find a model which could solve the coincidence problem : we cosmologists would observe the acceleration of the universe today because we happen to appear soon after the onset of matter domination which leads to the formation of structures  and human beings . in this section we analyze the models proposed so far which are built in order to fulfill this principle  @xcite .",
    "we study their sensitivity to initial conditions and comment on the fine - tuning involved . throughout the discussion we will refer to and make use of the parameters first introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite .      following the classification scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , this first model is of type @xmath68 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath69 as we will see , it appears to contain a number of problematic issues which on the face of it contradict what is stated in ref .",
    "for example for some ranges of @xmath70 we see that it is possible to have @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover we find that @xmath74 and @xmath75 diverge at @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "these properties are summarized in table  [ prop ] , where we have also introduced @xmath78 as the value of @xmath70 for which the sound speed vanishes . from eqs .",
    "( [ wk ] ) and ( [ csk ] ) , this also corresponds to the value where the equation of state parameter @xmath79 .",
    ".this table shows the sign of some variables as a function of @xmath70 for the two models analyzed in section  [ analysis ] . for each model",
    "the values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are given in the text .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath83 '' stands for a diverging value . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in what follows we only analyze the dynamics for @xmath84 , which corresponds to @xmath85 , since in this case @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and also the solution which `` solves '' the coincidence problem is in this region of the phase diagram .    since our concern over the dependency on initial conditions really only relates to the period of radiation domination , we assume that the universe is filled with radiation ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we have run simulations in order to determine the size of the basin of attraction of the tracker @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ basin_1 ] we have plotted the phase diagram for the k - essence field during radiation domination .",
    "the solid and long - dashed lines are the limiting solutions which separate the different types of trajectories .",
    "the vertical dashed line is the singularity @xmath42 . as explained in section  [ formalism ] , it can be divided in two parts : @xmath90 ( below @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 ( above @xmath91 ) .",
    "all the trajectories contained within the long - dashed line originate from the same point @xmath93 and the rest originate from segment @xmath90 .",
    "the solid lines separate the trajectories ending on @xmath92 , the ones reaching the tracker solution @xmath65 and the ones reaching the k - essence domination attractor @xmath67 .",
    "( having a look at the trajectories plotted in fig .",
    "[ basin_2 ] can be useful for understanding the dynamics , although this figure describes the model we study next . ) as we can see , the basin of attraction of @xmath65 ( shaded region ) is very small and most of the solutions reach @xmath67 .",
    "however as this is still during radiation domination , they reach the k - essence domination attractor too early ( typically after about @xmath94 e - foldings , i.e. after an increase of the scale factor @xmath95 by about a factor @xmath96 ) to be associated with the onset of matter  radiation equality and to be a candidate for dark energy .",
    "we also note that in a small region of the phase diagram the solutions cease to exist after a finite time as they reach @xmath92 , the part of singularity @xmath42 above @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , when analyzed in detail , this first model exhibits a rather different phase diagram structure from that sketched in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite to generically describe models of class @xmath68 .",
    "unfortunately a complete comparison is not possible as the precise equations used to generate that figure are not disclosed , so that we do not know to which k - essence model the figure corresponds ( nor whether the model has an explicit lagrangian description or is only of a more phenomenological nature ) .",
    "this second model is defined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 as in the previous example , this model is not always well defined .",
    "for @xmath99 we have @xmath100 and therefore @xmath9 becomes ill - defined . moreover , for @xmath101 , this model has the same problems as those of the model we have analyzed above . as before ,",
    "its properties are summarized in table  [ prop ] , where this time @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    as in the first example , this is a model of type @xmath68 and for @xmath105 its phase space has a similar structure to that shown in fig .",
    "[ basin_1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ basin_2 ] we have plotted the basin of attraction of the tracker solution @xmath65 during radiation domination for this second model . in order to help in understanding the dynamics a few trajectories have been added .",
    "again , we see that for most of the initial conditions the field does not reach the tracker , but instead it reaches either an early k - essence domination solution @xmath67 or the singularity on @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , this second model suffers the same fine - tuning as that of the first example .",
    "as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , the idea of k - essence seems appealing .",
    "current models of quintessence suffer in general because of the fine - tuning of the potential parameters to account for the fact that the field has only recently started dominating .",
    "k - essence was introduced as an extension of quintessence models by taking into account non - canonical kinetic terms . in a subclass of these models",
    "@xcite a tracker behaviour occurs during radiation domination , and a cosmological - constant - like behaviour shortly after the transition to matter domination .",
    "since the k - essence field seems to change its behaviour generically for purely dynamical reasons , these models could be claimed to solve the coincidence problem without fine - tuning of the initial conditions . in that sense",
    "they are more natural than quintessence models which rely on a different , non - obvious , scale for the transition to occur .    in this short paper , we have addressed in a bit more detail the question over the nature of this attractor solution during radiation domination which is meant to avoid a fine - tuning of the initial conditions .",
    "we have numerically solved the evolution equations for the k - essence fields and written the results in terms of the physically motivated parameters @xmath19 and @xmath25 , following refs .",
    "the key result we have found is that the basin of attraction for the tracker solution appears to be very small compared to the basin of attraction for the k - essence domination solution and therefore it can not be seen as equivalent to that of quintessence models .",
    "in other words , for almost all initial conditions , the system would evolve rapidly into k - essence domination .",
    "it would have done so way before matter  radiation equality and in that sense , the required behaviour of k - essence can only hold for a specific subset of initial conditions .",
    "if these turn out to be an important set of conditions then k - essence can be thought of as providing an elegant way of obtaining the acceleration we see today .",
    "however , if there is no particular reason for choosing such initial conditions , then we believe that k - essence suffers from the same fine - tuning issues that plague quintessence models .    with regard to this issue , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors argue that the basin of attraction of the radiation attractor of the two models studied in this paper are compatible with equipartition",
    ". this particular initial condition may be the case should the k - essence or quintessence field be associated with one of the many fields produced at the end of a period of inflation .",
    "however , it need not be the case , and if it was not , equipartition would not help in choosing initial conditions . indeed , equipartition is generally applied to systems where particle production occurs after the decay of the inflaton , whereas in the case of vacuum energy the initial condition may well have been set by early universe physics ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in any case",
    ", both basins of attraction are so small that their main parts do not overlap and therefore there remains a fine - tuning issue even when assuming equipartition .",
    "we have also shown that the models proposed so far feature a singularity associated with a diverging sound speed .",
    "this leads to problems like the sudden disappearance of some field trajectories .",
    "the presence of this singularity could be avoided by adding an extra term to the functions given by eqs .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model2 ] ) , but our attempts to do so have led to the creation of a second radiation attractor which goes against the goal of having a model for which the late - time behaviour is independent of the initial conditions . another way of solving this problem would be to argue that the theory is valid up to a certain cut - off which excludes the singularity , but as long as the radiation tracker is very close to the singularity this argument can not be applied .    in this paper",
    "we have dealt with the specific lagrangians given in refs .",
    "@xcite at face value .",
    "those lagrangians have a complicated form which is not appealing , and it is disappointing that so far it has not proved possible to produce much simpler models , as one would expect to be able to if the desired triggering behaviour really is generic to k - essence .",
    "the particular nature of the models makes it hard to assess how difficult it is to build a working example , for instance quite how much fine - tuning is required to establish the time needed between matter ",
    "radiation equality and k - essence domination , and how easily one can avoid the presence of many different attractors during radiation domination . unfortunately , we are not aware of any particular particle physics motivated models which would deliver the lagrangians of the two models , and , as with quintessence , we believe that a realistic model of k - essence remains a challenge which has to be met .",
