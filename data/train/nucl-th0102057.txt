    "the central unknown quantity required for reliable calculations of weak decay amplitudes are the hadronic matrix elements . in this respect ,",
    "the semileptonic @xmath0 decay is an interesting process : pseudoscalar mesons are well - understood as goldstone bosons , only the vector part of the weak interaction is involved , and there are experimental data available which allows one to judge various theoretical ( model ) calculations .",
    "these calculations generally fall into two different classes : effective theories using meson degrees of freedom , e.g. chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , and models employing quark and gluon degrees of freedom , e.g. constituent quark models  @xcite and the dyson  schwinger approach  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the light - front approach has been a popular framework for a hamiltonian approach to analyze exclusive hadronic processes  @xcite , and the pseudoscalar - to - pseudoscalar weak transition form factors have been studied within a light - front constituent quark model in ref .",
    "one complication of the light - front formalism is that in the analysis of timelike exclusive processes one needs to take into account light - front nonvalence contributions , which are absent in a manifestly poincar invariant approach .",
    "recently , an effective treatment has been presented  @xcite to incorporate such contributions , and a systematic program has been laid out  @xcite to take into account the nonvalence contributions",
    ". however , the systematic program explicitly requires all higher fock - state components while there has been relatively little progress in computing the basic wave - functions of hadrons from first principles .",
    "furthermore , the ( nonperturbative ) dressing of the quark - w vertex and the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking are yet underdeveloped aspects in this approach .",
    "in particular the latter aspect needs to be seriously considered for processes involving pions and kaons , which are the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .    in this work we use the set of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations [ dses ] to calculate the @xmath0 transition form factors .",
    "the dses provide us with a manifestly covariant approach which is consistent with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , electromagnetic current conservation  @xcite , and quark and gluon confinement  @xcite . for recent reviews on the dse and its application to hadron physics ,",
    "see refs .",
    "our calculation of the @xmath0 transition form factors is analogous to recent calculations of the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors in impulse approximation  @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate that in the same framework , with a consistent dressing of the quark - w vertex , we can also describe the semileptonic decay of both the neutral and charged kaons , without any readjustment of the model parameters . in sec .",
    "ii we review the formulation that underlies a description of the meson form factors within a modeling of qcd through the dses , and discuss the details of the model . in sec .",

    "mesons can be studied by solving the homogeneous bethe ",
    "salpeter equation [ bse ] for @xmath31 bound states , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 flavor indices , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the outgoing and incoming quark momenta respectively , and similarly for @xmath37 .",

    "this equation has solutions at discrete values of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the meson mass .",
    "together with the canonical normalization condition for @xmath39 bound states , it completely determines @xmath42 , the bound state bsa .",
    "the different types of mesons , such as ( pseudo-)scalar , ( axial-)vector , and tensor mesons , are characterized by different dirac structures .",

    "however , so long as poincar invariance is respected , the resulting physical observables are independent of this parameter  @xcite .    in order to describe weak ( and electromagnetic ) form factors one also needs the dressed @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 ) vertices .",
    "these vertices satisfy an inhomogeneous bse : e.g. the @xmath53 vertex satisfies @xmath54      to solve the bse , we use a ladder truncation , with an effective quark - antiquark interaction that reduces to the perturbative running coupling at large momenta  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the free gluon propagator in landau gauge .",

    ", the quark propagator reduces to the perturbative propagator in the ultraviolet region .",
    "however , in the infrared region both the wave function renormalization @xmath62 and the dynamical mass function @xmath63 deviate significantly from the perturbative behavior , due to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is interesting to note that the typical results obtained using the rainbow dse , a significant enhancement of @xmath64 below @xmath65 and also an enhancement of @xmath66 , have recently been confirmed by lattice simulations  @xcite ; with the present ladder dse model , the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are in semiquantitative agreement with the forms obtained in lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "the vector meson masses and electroweak decay constants one obtains in this model are in good agreement with experiments  @xcite . without any readjustment of the parameters ,",
    "one gets remarkable agreement with the most recent jlab data for @xmath69  @xcite , and also for other electromagnetic charge radii and form factors  @xcite .",
    "the strong decays of the vector mesons into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons are also well - described within this model  @xcite . here",
    "we apply the same approach to the kaon semileptonic decay .",
    "to calculate the form factors @xmath70 , we start by solving the quark dse in rainbow approximation , and subsequently use its solution to solve the homogeneous bse , eq .",

    "our results compare quite well with chiral perturbation theory , not only for the slope parameters , but also for the curvature of the form factors .",
    "a prediction from current algebra is the value of @xmath13 at the callan ",

    "the reason we get @xmath94 instead of @xmath95 is related to our value of @xmath96 : we obtain @xmath97 in our model  @xcite , compared to the experimental value @xmath98 . because our approach satisfies constraints coming from current conservation and the axial - vector ward ",
    "takahashi identity , it is not surprising that we indeed agree with these predictions from chiral perturbation theory .    outside the physical region , @xmath78 and @xmath13 are clearly not linear , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the region we considered",
    ", our result for @xmath86 is very well approximated by a monopole , with monopole mass @xmath99 .",
    "the reason for this monopole behavior is easy to understand : the vertex function @xmath20 has a resonance peak in its transverse vector components at the @xmath100 mass , because the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ verbse ] ) has a solution at @xmath101 , corresponding to the @xmath100 vector meson .",
    "the longitudinal part of the quark - w vertex has a resonance peak at the location of the @xmath102 scalar bound state .",
    "we tentatively identify this with the @xmath103 meson ; however , in contrast to vector states , the use of ladder approximation is expected to be inadequate for scalars  @xcite . near these bound states",
    ", the vertex behaves like @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the bound state bsas , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 the residues of the vertex at these poles  @xcite . in our model",
    "we have actual poles in the quark - w vertex , rather than resonance peaks , because we have not included meson loop corrections in our kernel , and therefore we do not generate a width for the @xmath100 nor the @xmath109 . in the spacelike region and at small timelike @xmath110",
    "we expect these corrections to be small .",
    "however , they will modify our results significantly close to the resonance peak .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ impulse ] ) , these poles in @xmath20 lead a similar behavior of @xmath111 near these poles . from eq .",
    "( [ fzerodef ] ) it is clear that the vector meson pole leads to a pole in @xmath86 , but not in @xmath13 , whereas the scalar meson induces a pole in @xmath13 but not in @xmath86 @xmath112 note that @xmath85 will in general be sensitive to both the scalar and the vector meson bound state .",
    "the present model has a vector bound state at @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "the experimental mass @xmath114 )  @xcite .",
    "thus the monopole behavior of the form factor @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] simply reflects the existence of this pole .",
    "a similar behavior was found in the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "the physical @xmath86 can be expected to rise more slowly with @xmath74 than our present calculations due to meson loop corrections , and will develop a nonzero imaginary part above the threshold for intermediate @xmath115 states .    the scalar form factor @xmath13 does also exhibit the expected pole behavior , and we are able to identify the scalar and the vector poles separately , see fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the lowest @xmath102 scalar bound state in this model has a mass of @xmath116 , which is rather low compared to the @xmath117 with a mass @xmath118 ; on the other hand , it could be an indication that there exists a light scalar resonance @xmath119 , as has been speculated  @xcite .",
    "something similar happens in in the @xmath120 quark sector : in rainbow - ladder truncation , one typically finds a scalar @xmath120 bound state around @xmath121 to @xmath122  @xcite , just below the @xmath123 mass .",
    "this bound state could either correspond to a broad @xmath124 , or to the @xmath79 and/or @xmath125 , in which case the calculated mass is about 30 to 40% too low .",
    "it is known that the leading perturbative corrections to the ladder kernel cancel to a large extent in both the pseudoscalar and vector channel , but not in the scalar channel ; we therefore expect in the scalar channel significant repulsive corrections to the ladder kernel which could increase the mass of the scalar bound state  @xcite .",
    "we also expect meson loop corrections to be more important in the scalar channel than in the vector channel .",
    "therefore , our calculation for @xmath13 should not be trusted quantitatively in the timelike region beyond the callan  treiman point , @xmath126",
    ".    in the spacelike asymptotic region @xmath73 and @xmath79 seem to behave differently : a monopole fit does not work for @xmath79 . in order to fit @xmath79 , we either need to add a nonzero constant , or use at least two monopoles . simple power counting indicates that @xmath8 scales like @xmath127 ; inserting this behavior in eqs .",
    "( [ fzero ] ) and ( [ fplus ] ) implies that @xmath86 falls like @xmath128 , but @xmath13 goes to a constant ( up to logarithmic corrections ) at large spacelike @xmath74 ( remember that @xmath129 scales like @xmath130 in the asymptotic region ) .",
    "this behavior of @xmath73 agrees with the pqcd predictions for the electromagnetic pion and kaon form factor  @xcite ; the behavior of @xmath79 can be understood if one realizes that the combination @xmath131 does fall like @xmath128 if @xmath13 goes to a constant .",
    "using the rainbow - ladder truncation of the set of dses with a model for the effective quark - antiquark interaction that has been fitted to the chiral condensate and @xmath132 , we study the @xmath0 decay in impulse approximation .",
    "our results , both for the form factors and for the decay width , are in good agreement with experimental data , without any readjustment of the parameters ; they also compare quite well with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "note however that in chiral perturbation theory the pion charge radius is used as input , in order to fix a low - energy constant , which is important for these form factors as well , in particular for @xmath133 . in our calculation , the only model parameters are in the infrared behavior of the effective quark - antiquark interaction , which were fitted to the chiral condensate and the pion decay constant  @xcite ; the pion charge radius follows from a calculation similar to the one presented here for the @xmath0 decay  @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on previous work by kalinovsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the results are quite similar .",
    "however , an important difference with this earlier study is that we dress the quark - w vertex by solving the inhomogeneous bse for this vertex .",
    "the main advantage of doing so is that we thus automatically include effects coming from intermediate vector and scalar mesons .",
    "another difference is that here we use actual solutions of a dse for the propagators and bs amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ impulse ] ) , rather than phenomenological parametrisations , which reduces the number of parameters in the calculation .",
    "we have demonstrated explicitly that both @xmath86 and @xmath13 exhibit resonance peaks in the timelike region due to the existence of vector and scalar bound states respectively .",
    "the effects of meson loops are not included in our present calculation , which is why we find a pole behavior rather than a resonance peak . in ref .  @xcite it was already demonstrated that non - analytic effects from such loops could contribute significantly to the behavior of the form factors , not only beyond the threshold for @xmath134 production , but also in the physical region .",
    "we hope to be able to incorporate these effects in future work .",
    "our results are also similar to those obtained recently by ji and choi  @xcite in a light - front calculation , at least for @xmath86 , which dominates this decay , even though details of the calculation are quite different . in light - front calculations of timelike processes",
    "one has to include particle - number - nonconserving fock states to recover the lorentz covariance , which complicates the calculation  @xcite .",
    "since our approach is manifestly covariant , such contributions are automatically included in our impulse approximation .",
    "another difference is that we use momentum - dependent quark self - energies , consistent with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite constituent quarks with fixed masses are used .",
    "recently , the effects of a running quark mass ( instead of a fixed constituent mass ) have been explored in a light - front calculation of the pion form factor  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see the effect of such a running mass on the @xmath0 form factors , in particular on @xmath85 , which in general appears to be quite sensitive to details of the calculation .",
