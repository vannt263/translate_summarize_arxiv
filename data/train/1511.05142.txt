    "motivated by the discovery of the correlation between black hole mass and galaxy properties , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback became a popular idea to invoke the self - regulation of black hole growth and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the connection among black hole activity , star formation , and feeding / feedback is much more complex than a simple scenario of a universal synchronized co - evolution , as various observations and theories have suggested .",
    "nonetheless , the strong effect of agn feedback has been demonstrated by a number of numerical and semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and various observational attempts are on going , searching for the evidence of agn feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a clear evidence has been shown in the x - rays as a form of flux depressions in large scales over the optical size of galaxies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the detected x - ray cavities are connected with agn jets as the radio lobes fill the x - ray cavities , indicating that the large scale bubbles are driven by the kinetic energy of agns .",
    "in contrast to the kinetic feedback as observed in radio jets or x - ray cavities , ionized gas outflows are often considered as related to radiative mode of agns .",
    "outflows are detected in various scales , from the pc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the narrow - line region ( nlr ) in kpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to play a role as an agn feedback mechanism",
    ", gas outflows should extend to relatively large scales beyond the galactic nuclei , so that gas heating or compressing interstellar matter can effectively occur to suppress or invoke star formation .",
    "thus , investigating outflows in the narrow - line region , which extends to a few hundred pc to several kpc scales , is of importance in understanding agn feedback .",
    "optical narrow emission lines are often used to trace gas outflows . in particular , the velocity measurements of the high - ionization line [ ]  @xmath05007 have been utilized for investigating agn - driven outflows .",
    "for example , based on spatially resolved measurements , the [ ]  kinematics reveal the velocity structure in the nlr of nearby seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while obtaining spatially resolved measurements of narrow emission line kinematics was limited to relatively small samples until very recently , various studies with integral field spectroscopy began to investigate the detailed flux and velocity structure in the nlr , and the characteristics of outflows and star formation of nearby galaxies and agns with rich spatial information ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    without spatially resolved measurements ,",
    "a number of studies has focused on the statistical analysis of the [ ]  kinematics and outflows , using spatially - integrated , flux - weighted single spectra of individual objects .",
    "recently , the sample size dramatically increased with the advent of large area surveys , i.e. , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the kinematics of [ ]  have been mainly constrained by two measurements : velocity shift and velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity shift of [ ]  with respect to the low ionization lines has been used as a tracer of gas outflows as the velocity shift reflects the flux - weighted gas motion to the line - of - sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although low ionization lines do not provide the accurate systemic velocity of the target galaxy since low - ionization lines themselves show velocity shift . using the systemic velocity measured from stellar absorption lines",
    ", obtained the accurate velocity shift of [ ]  and performed a census of [ ]  gas outflows . by detecting the velocity shift of [ ]  for 47% of agns among @xmath123,000 type 2 agns at z @xmath20.1 , they reported that outflows are common among type 2 agns .",
    "also , they concluded that the outflow fraction of type 2 agns is comparable to that of type 1 agns reported by previous studies , after accounting for the projection effect , which significantly decreases the line - of - sight velocity of type 2 agns .",
    "the width of [ ]  has been also used to trace the outflow signatures . for example , compared the fwhm of [ ] to stellar velocity dispersion , reporting a broad correlation albeit with considerably large scatter . however , they reported that the correlation is weaker for the base and wing of [ ] , suggesting that the presence of a broad wing component presents the non - gravitational kinematics .",
    "thus , both gravitational and non - gravitational effects cause the doppler broadening of [ ]  , and gas outflows can be better constrained by separating gravitational and non - gravitational components of [ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a detailed analysis of the [ ]  kinematics using the combined properties of velocity dispersion and velocity shift . compared to our previous work , first",
    ", we extend the census of gas outflows over a significantly large dynamical range , including high luminosity agns ( l@xmath3 } } \\sim 10^{43}$ ] erg s@xmath4 ) , mainly by pushing the redshift range of the sample out to z@xmath5 .",
    "second , while we mainly focused on the velocity shift of [ ]  in our previous work , here we provide new results based on the velocity dispersion of [ ] , in particular , by separating non - gravitational and gravitational kinematics .",
    "third , we investigate the connection of [ ]  outflows with radio activities .",
    "we present the sample and the measurements in section 2 , the main results in section 3 , and the discussion in section 4 , followed by summary and conclusions in section 5 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the cosmological parameters as @xmath6  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "39,000 type 2 agns out to z@xmath20.3 , selected from sdss dr7 , scaledwidth=42.0% ]    to investigate the kinematic signatures of ionized gas outflows and obtain statistical constraints on the outflow fractions , we selected a large sample of type 2 agns out to z@xmath10.3 from the mpa - jhu catalogue based on the sdss data release 7 @xcite , by extending our first census to a larger sample over a wider luminosity range .",
    "first , we obtained 235,922 emission line galaxies , with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath9 10 in the continuum , and with s / n @xmath9 3 in the four emission lines , h@xmath10 , [ ] @xmath05007 , h@xmath11 , and [ ] @xmath06584 . among them , we identified 106,971 type 2 agns in the bpt diagram @xcite , using the flux ratios of those 4 emission lines based on the classification scheme by @xcite .",
    "these type 2 agns include pure agns as well as composite objects , for which both agn and star formation contribute to the emission line fluxes .",
    "second , we further selected objects with a well - defined emission line profile by applying amplitude - to - noise ( a / n ) ratio larger than 5 for the [ ]  and h@xmath11  lines . in this process , we finalized a sample of 38,948 type 2 agns .",
    "for pure agns ( i.e. , excluding composite objects ) , which were identified based on the classification scheme by @xcite , we further classified seyfert galaxies using the flux ratio of log [ ] /h@xmath10  @xmath12 0.5 ( see figure 1 ) .    since seyfert galaxies are the most luminous agns among the sample while composite objects may suffer contamination from star formation , we will present the analysis results for 3 different categories : 1 ) agn+composite group , representing most agns , 2 ) agn group , representing pure agns only , and 3 ) seyfert group , representing luminous agns by excluding low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies ( see table 1 ) . depending on the choice of the definition of agns ( e.g ,",
    "whether or not to include liners ) , readers can accordingly refer the statistical results on the outflows .",
    "we measured the gas kinematics , mainly using the [ ]  line .",
    "first , we subtracted stellar absorption lines by fitting the sdss spectra with the best - fit stellar population models , which were constructed with the penalized pixel - fitting code @xcite based on the 47 miles simple stellar population models with solar metallicity and age spanning from 60 myrs to 12.6 gyrs @xcite . in this process , we measured the redshift of each galaxy and calculated the systemic velocity , which was compared to the flux - weighted velocity of [ ]  .",
    "after subtracting stellar continuum from the raw spectra , we fit the [ ]  line with a single or double - gaussian function by using the mpfit code ( markwardt 2009 ) .",
    "we adopted a double gaussian function , if the [ ]  line profile shows a prominent wing component or a secondary component . to avoid fitting the noise as a second gaussian component",
    ", we applied a criterion that the peak of the second component should be clearly larger than the noise level ( i.e. , a / n ratio @xmath12 3 ) .",
    "if the fitted second gaussian component is weak ( i.e. , a / n ratio @xmath2 3 ) , we assumed that [ ]  has no second gaussian component , and adopted the fitting result with a single - gaussian function .",
    "out of the total sample , 16,965 agns ( 43.6% ) have double gaussian [ ]  line profile with the presence of a wing component .",
    "the high fraction of double gaussian [ ]  already indicates that gas outflow is common among type 2 agns ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the broader gaussian component is wider than the narrower gaussian component by an average factor of 2.9 .",
    "once we obtained the best fit model for [ ] , we calculated the first moment of the line profile ( flux - weighted center ) as @xmath13 then , by comparing the first moment of [ ]  with the systemic velocity measured from stellar absorption lines , we calculated the velocity shift of [ ] .",
    "note that used the peak of the emission line profile , which represents the velocity offset of the core component of the emission line , for calculating the velocity shift . in this paper",
    ", we instead used the first moment , which better represents the flux - weighted velocity shift of [ ]  if a wing component is present in the line profile .",
    "second , we calculated the second moment ( velocity dispersion ) of the [ ]  line profile as @xmath14}}]^2   = { \\int \\lambda^2 f_\\lambda d\\lambda \\over \\int f_\\lambda d\\lambda } - \\lambda_0 ^ 2 ,   \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the flux at each wavelength , and @xmath16 is the first moment of the line . to determine the uncertainty of @xmath17}}$ ] of each object",
    ", we generated 100 mock spectra by randomizing flux with flux error at each wavelength . from the distribution of @xmath17}}$ ] measured from individual mock spectra",
    ", we adopted the 1 @xmath18 dispersion as the uncertainty of @xmath17}}$ ] .",
    "then , the second moment of [ ]  ( @xmath19}}$ ] ) and its uncertainty were converted to velocity scale . when we examined the fractional error of the second moment ( @xmath19}}$ ] ) of the sample , the distribution shows a gaussian distribution with a mean value of @xmath20 in log scale , which corresponds to @xmath114% uncertainty .",
    "we removed 1229 objects with a large uncertainty ( i.e. fractional error @xmath12 1 ) from the sample ( @xmath13% of the sample ) when we used @xmath19}}$ ] values in the analysis .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions were corrected for the wavelength - dependent instrumental resolution of the sdss spectroscopy , which is close to 55 - 60 km s@xmath4  at the observed wavelength of [ ] .",
    "a number of objects has relatively narrow [ ] , for which the measured @xmath19}}$ ] is smaller than the instrumental resolution . for these 119 objects",
    ", we assumed that the [ ]  line is not resolved , hence , we removed them from further analysis . also , we excluded 150 objects with very low velocity dispersion ( i.e. , @xmath19}}$ ] @xmath2 30 km s@xmath4 ) since they are also relatively uncertain .",
    "in total we excluded 1498 objects ( 3.9% ) , which have either very small velocity dispersion ( i.e. , @xmath19}}$ ] @xmath2 30 km s@xmath4 ) or large fractional errors ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "note that including these objects does not change our conclusions in the following analysis .",
    "similarly , we obtained the uncertainty of the [ ]  velocity shift based on the monte carlo simulations . using the distribution of the measured [ ]  velocity shift from 100 mock spectra",
    ", we adopted the 1 @xmath18 dispersion as the uncertainty of the [ ]  velocity shift .",
    "the mean uncertainty of the sample is @xmath21 km s@xmath4 , indicating that very weak velocity shifts ( i.e. , @xmath210 - 20 km s@xmath4 ) are difficult to detect .      to investigate the dependency of the ionized gas kinematics on agn luminosity and eddington ratio , we determined agn bolometric luminosity , black hole mass , and eddington ratio of each object . first , since the accretion luminosity is not directly measurable for type 2 agns , we used the luminosity of the [ ]  line as a proxy for the bolometric luminosity after multiplying by a bolometric correction ( i.e. , 3500 for the extinction - uncorrected [ ]  luminosity ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "second , we estimated black hole masses based on the scaling relations , e.g. , black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion ( m@xmath22-@xmath23 ) relation @xcite , and black hole mass - stellar mass relation , by adopting stellar velocity dispersion and stellar mass from the sdss catalogue . depending on the adopted scaling relation ,",
    "the range of black hole mass significantly changes .",
    "for example , the estimated black hole masses based on the m@xmath22-@xmath23  relations range from @xmath110@xmath24 to 10@xmath25 m@xmath26 , while the black hole masses determined from stellar mass span from @xmath110@xmath27 to 10@xmath28 m@xmath26 . instead of determining the accurate black hole masses and eddington ratios , we are interested in investigating the effect of eddington ratio to gas outflows .",
    "thus , we chose to use the black hole mass estimated using the stellar masses , since the mass range seems more reasonable compared to that of local type 1 agns .",
    "third , for given black hole masses , we calculated the eddington luminosity in order to determine eddington ratio by combining with the estimated bolometric luminosity .",
    "note that the choice of black hole mass estimates does not change our conclusions on the effect of eddington ratios , although the eddington ratio range of the sample varies .",

    "figure 2 presents the mean [ ]  luminosity of the sample at each redshift bin , respectively for 3 groups : agn+composite , agn , and seyfert only groups .",
    "the sample covers 5 orders of magnitude in the [ ]  luminosity from 10@xmath29 to 10@xmath30 erg s@xmath4 , while the mean luminosity at each redshift bin ranges from 10@xmath31 to 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath4 . in the case of seyfert only group , the mean [ ]  luminosity is a factor of @xmath12 higher than that of the total sample .",
    "note that the [ ]  luminosity has not been corrected for extinction .",
    "when we correct for extinction using the balmer decrement ( i.e. , the h@xmath11-to - h@xmath10  flux ratio of 2.86 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the [ ]  luminosity increases by an average factor of @xmath17 .",
    "however , since the extinction correction based on the h@xmath11-to - h@xmath10  flux ratio is very uncertain for agns with a weak h@xmath10  line , we mainly present the uncorrected [ ]   luminosities in this paper .",
    "we note that the main conclusion of the analysis remains the same even if the extinction - corrected [ ]  luminosities are adopted .    in figure 2",
    ", all three groups show an increasing trend of the [ ]  luminosity as a function of redshift . however , this trend is not due to the luminosity evolution .",
    "owing to the flux limit of the sdss survey and our selection criteria on the emission lines ( i.e. , s /",
    "n @xmath12 3 ) , we preferentially include more luminous agns at higher redshift in our sample .",
    "thus , the lack of low luminosity agns at higher redshift bins simply reflects the selection limit .",
    "on the other hand , the mean eddington ratio is relatively flat out to z@xmath10.3 , with only an average 0.5 dex change , indicating that the mean eddington ratio of the sample in each redshift bin is comparable to each other .",
    "the relatively flat trend of eddington ratio is simply due to the fact that the mean [ ]  luminosity as well as the galaxy mass scale ( galaxy luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ) increase with redshift , leading to canceling of the two .",
    "consequently , the eddington ratio of the sample is roughly constant over the redshift range , although there is a large scatter of several orders of magnitude at each redshift bin .",
    "we first investigate whether the [ ]  gas kinematics are governed by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy , by comparing the velocity dispersion of [ ]  measured from our analysis with stellar velocity dispersion provided by the sdss catalogue . in figure 3 , we present the comparison for each group as we define them in section 2 .",
    "we also color - code agns for each redshift bin to indicate the increasing luminosity and mass scales with redshift .",
    "note that for completeness we include stellar and [ ]  velocity dispersion values that are slightly lower than the sdss instrumental resolution , down to 30 km s@xmath4 .",
    "thus , the measurements of [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions are uncertain at the lower left region of the diagram .",
    "we also exclude unreliably large stellar velocity dispersion values above 420 km s@xmath4  as recommended by the sdss catalogue .",
    "the number of excluded objects with uncertain stellar velocity dispersion value corresponds to @xmath13% of the sample .",
    "we find a broad correlation between [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions , confirming that the bulge gravitational potential plays a main role in determining [ ]  kinematics as reported by previous studies .",
    "however , the [ ]  velocity dispersion is on average larger than stellar velocity dispersion , suggesting that there are additional kinematic components on top of the bulge gravitational potential .",
    "the correlation between [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions is not linear , with the higher [ ]  to stellar velocity dispersion ratios for more massive ( i.e. , higher stellar velocity dispersion ) galaxies .",
    "when we perform a forward regression , including measurement errors in both [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions , we obtain the best - fit slop of @xmath33 and the intrinsic scatter of 0.19 dex for the total sample .",
    "the slope slightly increases to @xmath34 for seyfert only group while the intrinsic scatter is 0.22 dex , which is comparable to that of the total sample . using the inverse regression ,",
    "we virtually obtain the consistent results ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the discussion on the regression method ) .",
    "if we separately fit agns with double gaussian [ ]  and agns with single gaussian [ ] , we obtain slope of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , indicating that the relation is clearly non - linear when a wing component is present in [ ] .",
    "these results may imply that the effect of the non - gravitational component is stronger in more massive systems ( with higher stellar velocity dispersion , higher stellar mass , and higher black hole mass , assuming the black hole mass scaling relations ) .",
    "the presence of a broad wing component in the [ ]  line profile or a velocity shift of the line is likely to reflect a non - gravitational velocity field .",
    "thus , we expect that the [ ]  velocity dispersion is larger than stellar velocity dispersion when a wing component is detected in the [ ]  line profile .",
    "in fact , the difference between [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions is larger for agns with a double gaussian [ ]  line profile .",
    "for example , showed that the [ ]  line profile base and wings do not tightly correlate with stellar velocity dispersion compared to the [ ]  core , using a sample of @xmath168 seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",

    "-to - stellar velocity dispersions as a function of [ ]  luminosity , for agns with single gaussian [ ]  ( blue ) and agns with double gaussian [ ] .",

    "first , we find that the velocity dispersion of single gaussian [ ]  is comparable to stellar velocity dispersion . the average ratio of [ ] -to - stellar velocity dispersions is 1 , 1 , 1.03 , respectively for agn+composite , agn , and seyfert only groups .",
    "in contrast , for agns with a double gaussian [ ]  line profile , the [ ]  velocity dispersion is larger than stellar velocity dispersion by 0.12 , 0.13 , 0.14 dex ( a factor of 1.3 - 1.4 ) , respectively for agn+composite , agn , and seyfert only groups , indicating that the non - gravitational effect plays a significant role in broadening the [ ]  emission line .",
    "we also find that the ratio between [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions increases with the [ ]  luminosity , suggesting that the non - gravitational effect is stronger for higher luminosity agns .",
    "assuming the [ ]  velocity dispersion is caused by the gravitational _ and _ non - gravitational components , we estimate the non - gravitational velocity dispersion of [ ] , using the relation : @xmath37 here , we use stellar velocity dispersion as a proxy for the kinematic component due to the gravitational potential ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that the non - gravitational kinematic component is almost comparable to the gravitational component for agns with double gaussian [ ]  since their [ ]  velocity dispersion is broader by an average factor of @xmath11.3 than stellar velocity dispersion .",

    "in fact , they discussed that the correlation with stellar velocity dispersion is much weaker for the [ ]  base and wing , showing that gas velocities are on average larger than stellar velocities .    the correlation between [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersions reported by has been utilized to estimate black hole masses of type 1 agns , for which stellar velocity dispersion can not be directly measured due to the high agn - to - stellar flux ratios . using the width of [ ]  as a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion , black hole mass can be estimated from the m@xmath22-@xmath23  relation . however , since the [ ]  and stellar velocity dispersion relation has a considerably large scatter , black hole mass based on the [ ]  line width has large uncertainty . in particular ,",
    "when a broad component is present in the [ ]  line profile , the width of [ ]  does not well represent the bulge gravitational potential , as confirmed by the direct comparison with the velocity dispersion of low ionization lines or stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by directly measuring the second moment of the [ ] , instead of fhwm , several studies showed that the [ ]  velocity dispersion may not be a good proxy for stellar velocity dispersion , particularly when a broad wing component is present in the line profile .",
    "for example , in comparing gas and stellar kinematics based on a sample of 1,749 type 2 agns , used the second moment of [ ] , finding that [ ]  shows a broad correlation with stellar velocity dispersion only after removing a blue wing component .",
    "in addition , they reported that the wing component is related to eddington ratio .",
    "the result by @xcite based on a stacking analysis using a large sample of sdss agns also showed that the width of [ ]  systematically increases with luminosity and eddington ratios .    using a statistically large sample of type 2 agns in the local universe ( at z@xmath20.3 ) , we reported a detailed comparison of [ ]  and stellar kinematics as a function of agn luminosity , eddington ratio , and radio luminosity .",
    "we confirm the results of previous studies that the bulge gravitational potential plays a main role in determining gas kinematics in the nlr .",
    "however , we clearly find the non - gravitational components in the [ ]  kinematics , of which the strength increases with both luminosity and eddington ratio . based on the distribution in the vvd diagram , which dramatically broadens for higher luminosity agns and higher eddington ratio objects ,",
    "we conclude that the launching velocity is closely connected to agn accretion .    to understand the physics of gas outflows , it is important to estimate the fundamental physical parameters , i.e. , launching velocity , extinction , inclination of the cones , opening angle , velocity structure in the nlr , etc , which are not directly observable particularly for type 2 agns . in a following study , we will present the dependence of the location of agns in the vvd diagram as a function of the main physical parameters , using our 3-d biconical outflow model simulations ( h .- j .",
    "bae & j .- h .",
    "woo 2016 in preparation ) . in figure 15",
    ", we briefly highlight the effect of launching velocity and extinction in the vvd diagram based on our 3-d biconical outflow models .",
    "first , if the intrinsic velocity of the gas outflows becomes larger , the velocity dispersion of [ ]  increases since the doppler broadening becomes stronger . however , if there is no dust extinction , the flux - weighted velocity of receding and approaching gas particles can cancel out each other , resulting in small or zero velocity shift , as we detect a large fraction of agns showing small or zero velocity shift at given velocity dispersion values .",
    "in contrast , dust extinction can increase the velocity shift . if extinction due to the dust in the stellar disk is high",
    ", then it preferentially reduces the flux from the cone behind the disk , leading to shift of the mean velocity in the flux - weighted spectra .",
    "in other words , more extinction leads to higher velocity shift since the difference of the fluxes between the two cones increases with extinction .",
    "thus , there are mainly two parameters to determine the location of agns in the vvd diagram ; the launching velocity mainly increases velocity dispersion ( vertical direction ) while extinction increases velocity shift ( horizontal direction ) as shown in figure 15 .",
    "the detailed results on the effect of physical parameters will be given in our upcoming paper ( h .- j .",
    "bae , & j .- h .",
    "woo 2016 in preparation ) .",
    "velocity - velocity dispersion diagram and the effect of launching velocity and extinction .",
    "black points are type 2 agns presented in this work .",
    "arrows show the direction of the change of velocity and velocity dispersion based on the 3-d biconical outflow models . ]",
    "the outflow fraction varies depending on the condition that defines the outflow signatures .",
    "based on the small velocity shift of [ ] , previous studies reported the outflow fraction for type 1 and type 2 agns as from @xmath125 to 70% .",
    "however , these measurements are considered as a lower limit since small velocity shift is challenging to measure particular for type 2 agns since the projected line - of - sight velocity shift is only a small fraction of the true radial velocity . using a large sample of type 2 agns",
    ", we obtained qualitatively similar outflow fraction based on the [ ]  velocity shift .    in this study",
    "we used the normalized [ ]  velocity dispersion divided by stellar velocity dispersion in order to detect the non - gravitational kinematic signatures .",
    "we find that 59.8% of agns have a detectable non - gravitational component ( i.e. , @xmath19}}$ ] @xmath12 @xmath23 ) .",
    "based on the presence of a broad component in [ ] , we also constrained the outflow fraction , which is 43.6% of the total type 2 agn sample . for agns with weak [ ]",
    ", it is also difficult to properly model the line profile and detect a broad component .",
    "thus , the detected fraction of the double gaussian profile depends on the quality of data and the strength of the [ ]  line . on the other hand ,",
    "very weak wing components are not interesting since they represent relatively weak non - gravitational kinematics .",
    "the high fraction of agns with non - gravitational kinematic signatures suggests that ionized gas outflows are common among type 2 agns .",
    "in particular , the majority of luminous agns above 1% of the eddington limit presents a broad component , or large velocity dispersion and velocity shift in [ ] , indicating the prevalence of outflows among luminous agns .",
    "we find that the kinematics of [ ]  is not directly related to radio activity .",
    "first , the majority of type 2 agns are not detected by the first survey , while non - gravitational kinematics are clearly present in these agns , suggesting that radio is not responsible for the outflows for the majority of agns .",
    "second , while we detect a clear increasing trend of the [ ]  velocity dispersion with radio luminosity as found by previous studies @xcite , we do not find any trend of the non - gravitational kinematics with radio luminosity , once we normalize the [ ]  velocity dispersion with stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "this suggests that the radio luminosity is on average higher for higher mass galaxies and that the [ ]  velocity dispersion increases with radio luminosity simply due to the increasing gravitational potential .",
    "thus , we find no evidence that the non - gravitational kinematics of [ ]  is related to radio activity .    based on the analysis of the stacked spectra using a large sample of sdss agns , @xcite reported that the fwhm of [ ]  peaks at l@xmath110@xmath48 - 10@xmath50 erg s@xmath4 , while more radio - luminous agns have on average narrower [ ] .",
    "although we obtained similar trend , we find that the average [ ]  line width continuously increases with radio luminosity .",
    "since we compare the velocity dispersion ( second moment ) of [ ]  with radio luminosity , the difference caused by the choice of the width parameter ( fwhm vs. second moment ) can partly explain these different results . on the other hand , once we normalize the [ ]  velocity dispersion by stellar velocity dispersion",
    ", we find a relatively flat trend up to very high radio luminosity , indicating that non - gravitational kinematics are not related to radio activity .",
    "since the radio luminosity of typical radio galaxies is larger than the mean radio luminosity 10@xmath60 erg s@xmath4  of our radio - detected sample , the number of strong radio sources in our sample is relatively small .",
    "for example , we only have 2060 objects above l@xmath59 @xmath110@xmath48 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "thus , a large sample of well - defined radio selection function is needed to investigate how the radio activity is connected to the kinematics of nlr . however , for the majority of type 2 agns in our sample , the ionized gas outflows manifested by the [ ]  line profile are not directly related to the radio activity .",
    "using a large sample of @xmath139,000 type 2 agns out to z@xmath10.3 , we investigated the kinematics of the ionized gas and the connection with agn energetics , and the fraction of outflows .",
    "we summarize the main results as follows .",
    "@xmath61 we find a broad correlation between stellar and [ ]  velocity dispersions , indicating that the gravitational potential of the galaxy bulge plays a main role in determining the gas kinematics in the nlr . however , the [ ]  velocity dispersion is larger than the stellar velocity dispersion , suggesting that non - gravitational component , i.e. , outflows , is clearly present . in particular , the [ ]  velocity dispersion is larger by an average factor of 1.3 - 1.4 than stellar velocity dispersion when a broad component is present , indicating that the effect of non - gravitational broadening is almost comparable to that of gravitational component .",
    "@xmath61 we find a clear trend that the [ ]  velocity dispersion increases with both [ ]  luminosity and eddington ratio , suggesting that more energetic agns tend to have stronger outflow kinematics as manifested by broader [ ]  lines .",
    "@xmath61 we find that agns with higher [ ]  velocity shift ( with respect to systemic velocity ) preferentially have higher [ ]  luminosity , suggesting that the [ ]  velocity shift is connected to agn radiation .",
    "@xmath61 in the [ ]  velocity - velocity dispersion diagram , we find a characteristic shape of the distribution such that [ ]  lines with higher velocity shift tend to have higher velocity dispersion , implying that velocity and velocity dispersion increases with increasing launching outflow velocity .",
    "the distribution in the vvd diagram expands toward higher velocity shift and velocity dispersion as a function of [ ]  luminosity , suggesting that agn luminosity is directly linked to the launching velocity , hence velocity shift and velocity dispersion .",
    "@xmath61 while we find an increasing trend of the [ ]  velocity dispersion as a function of radio luminosity , there is no clear trend with radio luminosity once [ ]  velocity dispersion is normalized by stellar velocity dispersion , indicating non - gravitational component of [ ]  is not directly related to radio activity .",
    "@xmath61 we find that the fraction of agns with a double gaussian [ ]  profile dramatically increases with luminosity",
    ". the majority of high - luminosity agns ( i.e. , 10@xmath51 erg s@xmath4 ) shows a broad component , indicating that gas outflows are prevalent among type 2 agns .",
    "we find a similar increase of the fraction as a function of eddington ratios .",
    "@xmath61 we find that the fraction of high velocity dispersion increases with [ ]  luminosity and eddington ratios .",
    "the fraction of agns , which have non - gravitational component comparable to or larger than gravitational component ( i.e. , @xmath19}}$ ] @xmath12 1.4 @xmath53 @xmath23 ) , increases with luminosity from 10% at l@xmath3}}$]@xmath110@xmath48 to 50% at l@xmath3}}$]@xmath110@xmath51 , indicating that the kinematics due to gas outflows is very strong among high luminosity agns . as a function of eddington ratio",
    ", we find a similar fraction and increase .      the measurements of [ ]  gas kinematics of a large sample of type 2 agns place statistical constraints on the connection of nlr gas kinematics with agn luminosity and eddington ratio .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the ionized gas outflows are common in type 2 agns . particularly for high luminosity agns ,",
    "the kinematic signatures of the ionized gas outflow are prevalent .",
    "the agns with very large velocity shift and velocity dispersion in the vvd diagram are arguably one of the best samples for follow - up studies in understanding agn feeding and feedback and the role of agns in the coevolution of smbhs and their host galaxies . based on the results presented in this study , we are performing integral field spectroscopy for a sample of strong outflows candidates ( karouzos et al .",
