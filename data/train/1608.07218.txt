    "<S> we propose a model solely based on actin treadmilling and polymerisation which describes many characteristic states of actin wave formation : spots , spirals and travelling waves . in our model , as in experiments on cell recovering motility following actin depolymerisation , we choose an isotropic low density initial condition ; polymerisation of actin filaments then raises the density towards the onsager threshold where they align . </S>",

    "<S> , under particular conditions , actin fibers reorganize within the cell , and create different patterns , such as travelling or scroll waves  @xcite .    in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism through which actin waves arise is relatively well understood , and is given by a network of biochemical regulatory reactions involving actin - associated proteins  @xcite , which can be effectively modeled as an activator - inhibitor dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> such models , based on nonlinear biochemistry , successfully explain cases where actin waves are associated with the activation of the scar - wave complex  @xcite , and they are linked to chemotaxis  @xcite . however , there are other examples where waves depend on only a small number of components . </S>",
    "<S> most relevant to our work are the waves observed in _ dictyostelium </S>",
    "<S> _ cells recovering from treatment with latrunculin , which causes mass depolymerisation of actin fibers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when latrunculin is taken away , actin fibers repolymerise from monomers in the cytosol , and after this cells recover motility : they do so by undergoing a surprisingly complex pattern formation cascade . </S>",
    "<S> first , actin assembles into transient spots , which then evolve into waves ; spiral patterns are also observed in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> a set of experiments knocking out several actin - associated proteins clarified that the dynamics leading to waves is not dependent , among others , on the scar - wave complex , or on contractile myosin motors  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the waves observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have to date been addressed by a number of models in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these works lead to wave formation , and all include some nonlinear dynamics , such as the fitz - nagumo model  @xcite , or other activator - inhibitor models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is often motivated by the observation that some actin - associated proteins _ </S>",
    "<S> are _ found in waves  most notably , coronin , which localizes at the rear of a wave , and myosin i , which lies at the front  @xcite . while these are all perfectly plausible models , they either rely on the existence of a delay , or on ( cubic ) nonlinear reaction terms which are generally quite system specific .    here </S>",
    "<S> we suggest an alternative model for wave formation , which does not require _ any _ nonlinear biochemistry , and solely depends on three simple and generic ingredients : actin polymerisation , steric repulsion between actin fibres , and treadmilling ( i.e. , the effective motion of actin fibres which grow at one end and shrink at the other one  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> since all three ingredients occur in a wide class of systems featuring actin waves , our findings suggest that spots and waves could hinge on a universal mechanism and do not , as the current literature suggests , require system specific nonlinear chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> this key finding should be of particular relevance for the current understanding of waves in _ dictyostelium _ _ in vivo _ ; they also suggest how to set up experiments _ in vitro _ to generate similar patterns .    in our model actin filaments </S>",

    "<S> _ dictyostelium _ , however , alignment interactions are ineffective . as a preliminary step to wave formation , polymerisation increases the fibre density . </S>",

    "<S> polymerisation shapes the morphology of the emerging waves , and allows controlling their lengthscale .    to specify our qualitative arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we now propose a dynamical model to study pattern formation in a system of polymerising actin fibers , where we follow both the density of f - actin filaments , @xmath2 , and their average polarisation ( i.e. , the sum of orientation unit vectors per unit volume ) , @xmath3 . the equations of motion defining our model read as follows : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient for f - actin , @xmath6 is an effective elastic constant , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the treadmilling speed and the polymerisation rate respectively . </S>",
    "<S> further , @xmath9 measures how fast f - actin filaments change their direction , the term in @xmath10 ensures saturation of the polarisation , whereas @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate respectively the critical density above which nematic order sets in , and the target polymerisation density ( i.e. , the density of f - actin which would be reached due to polymerisation in a well - stirred system in the absence of spatial effects ) . for @xmath13 , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) are related to the models of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , although even in that limit our emphasis here is on the dynamical pathway the system follows , rather than on steady state behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also useful to recast eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) in terms of dimensionless variables , as follows , @xmath14 where we have defined @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and we have further redefined @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so as to have dimensionless time , space , density and polarisation . </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eomdimless1],[eomdimless2 ] ) also clarify that the dynamics of our model depends on four dimensionless parameters  while we have varied all of these , we have found that @xmath23 , which is the ratio between alignment and polymerisation rate , is our key control parameter ( provided that @xmath24 ) . to provide an overview over the possible patterns in this system , we vary this parameter in the following while keeping other parameters at values given in the caption of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to estimate the orders of magnitude of parameter values which are relevant to experiments . _ in vivo _ or in the lab , actin may polymerise at a rate @xmath25 s@xmath26  @xcite , while @xmath9 may be estimated as the rotational diffusion of an intracellular f - actin filament of typical geometry @xmath27 m @xmath28 nm , which is @xmath29 s@xmath26  @xcite . for this geometry , the onsager threshold of actin fibers can be estimated as @xmath30 in volume fraction  the inverse of their aspect ratio  whereas the fiber density in a cell is up to @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> g / l  @xcite , or @xmath31 in volume fraction . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> an experimentally relevant range of parameters is @xmath32 , and @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have solved eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eomdimless1],[eomdimless2 ] ) for different values of @xmath23 on a square lattice of size @xmath33 using finite difference methods , periodic boundary conditions and a uniform initial state @xmath34 plus some small fluctuations . for identical polymerisation and alignment rate ( @xmath35 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we initially observe a uniform density growth followed , after a certain lag time , by the formation of one or several spots growing out of the uniform phase ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a and video 1 in sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these spots have a spiral - like orientation of the actin fibres ( fig . 1a , inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , they are not stable , but decay after a lifetime of about 200 polymerisation cycles back to the uniform state . </S>",
    "<S> if fibres align faster than new ones are polymerised ( @xmath36 ) , we again observe transient spot formation . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , however , here we do not end up with a uniform phase but observe the emergence of travelling actin waves . </S>",
    "<S> these waves self - arrange into a pattern with a well - defined length scale ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b and video 2 in sm ) . further enhancing the alignment rate ( @xmath37 ) again </S>",
    "<S> leads to the formation of spots . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , the spots are less pronounced and start to spiral and move while growing  @xcite ; they continuously transforms into travelling waves ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c and video 3 in sm ) . further enhancing @xmath23 directly leads to waves without a preceding spot stage . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , strikingly , our simple and generic model accounts for the sequence of actin patterns , from spots to waves , observed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now want to understand why spots and then waves emerge .    to this end , we now perform a linear stability analysis of our equations of motion ( providing results here in physical units ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the present system has three uniform solutions . </S>",
    "<S> these are : ( i ) @xmath38 ( which we chose as our initial state , following _ in - vivo _ experiments ) , ( ii ) @xmath39 , ( iii ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents a unit vector pointing in a spontaneously chosen direction set by the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> all solutions correspond to uniform phases : the first two are unpolarized , the third is polarized , hence travelling ( flocking ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we explore the stability of our initial low density state . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant branch of the dispersion relation of fluctuations around this phase reads @xmath42 : therefore our initial state is generally unstable against polymerisation , simply leading to a density growth in the whole system if @xmath43 ( with no effect on the polarization field , as the eigenmode of the unstable mode is orthogonal to @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this density growth proceeds until we have @xmath45 ; i.e. polymerisation generally transfers the system from phase ( i ) to phase ( ii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely to phase ( i ) , for @xmath46 , alignment interactions become effective in phase ( ii ) , i.e. they dominate over rotational diffusion  see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eom2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the dominant branch of the dispersion relation , @xmath47 ( see sm ) , of fluctuations in this phase , which yields a stationary long wavelength instability . </S>",
    "<S> notably , alignment interactions are strong enough here to generate an instability of the uniform unpolarized phase but too weak to generate waves ( which would require an oscillatory instability ) . </S>",
    "<S> following this instability , the dynamical pathway of our system is subtle and can be described as follows . </S>",
    "<S> actin fibres align locally , leading to polarized domains , with the polarization field of each domain pointing in a spontaneously chosen direction . </S>",
    "<S> due to treadmilling each of these domains moves , but soon collides with other domains of aligned fibres , resulting in a defect in the @xmath44 field with ingoing fibre - density flux from all directions ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , which in turn generates a spot in the density field ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is a natural and generic consequence of the instability of phase ( ii ) and therefore part of the dynamic pathway followed by our system , when initialised in phase ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the length scale of the spots , @xmath48 , by a combination of linear stability analysis ( see sm ) and systematic parameter sweeps , and found that @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the typical spot size increases with diffusion but decreases with self - propulsion velocity . this scaling is intuitive , since fibres treadmill from all directions towards the spot center thereby competing with diffusion ( a similar scaling , albeit leading to a distinct functional form for @xmath48 , determined the size of aster size in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we found that for @xmath50 the spot size converges to a healing length @xmath51 representing the distance needed for the polarization field to recover from a local orientational perturbation ( defect ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , in the absence of polymerisation ( @xmath13 ) , our asters satisfy the steady state condition of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eom1 ] ( @xmath52 ) yielding a solution @xmath53 where fibre treadmill up the density gradient thereby permanently balancing diffusive fibre losses . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , however , the local density in the spot exceeds @xmath12 , leading for @xmath54 to depolymerisation . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn initiates fisher waves travelling from the spot in all directions . </S>",
    "<S> we expect these fisher wave fronts to move with a characteristic velocity of @xmath55 ; these waves combine with the alignment interactions to decrease spot size and take the system back towards a uniform phase . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario describes the transition from a uniform phase to spot and back to uniformity as observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> but why does the described scenario not repeat to initiate new spots ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is , that the new uniform phase is now polarized and given by ( iii ) rather than by ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the spots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ( video 1 in sm ) are a generic transient pattern formed as actin fibers polymerise starting from a low density phase . </S>",
    "<S> having followed this pathway from phase ( i ) to phase ( iii ) , we now want to know how waves emerge . </S>",
    "<S> let us therefore explore the stability of phase ( iii ) by calculating the dispersion relation of fluctuations around this phase ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , see also sm ) . remarkably , @xmath56 is always negative at small @xmath57 but becomes positive at finite @xmath57 if @xmath23 is sufficiently large ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . since also </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the dispersion relation is finite , we have an _ oscillatory _ </S>",
    "<S> _ short wavelength _ instability and may therefore expect travelling waves for sufficiently strong alignment interactions ( @xmath23 ) : this explains our previous observation of travelling waves in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the velocity of our waves is given by @xmath58  this is true if @xmath59 , otherwise @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the wave speed is proportional to the treadmilling velocity of individual fibres , weighted by an alignment factor measuring the average fraction of aligned filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between adjacent wave peaks can be estimated by numerical evaluation of the dispersion relation of our linear stability analysis revealing a fastest growing mode at length scale @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 if @xmath64 , or @xmath65 if @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> ( see sm , note we have dropped for simplicity an extra non - dimensional dependence on @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations confirm that the wave length is typically close to this value , at least deep into the wave forming regime . </S>",
    "<S> the width of our wave peaks follows , approximately , a variant of our healing length @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 if @xmath71 ( see sm for more details )  in this context this is the length scale over which diffusion neutralizes polar ordering within a wave peak .    </S>",
    "<S> the possible scenarios can be summarised in a phase diagram ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . for small @xmath23 and @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. when alignment interactions are weak and the saturation fibre density is close to the onsager threshold , the evolution features a uniform increase of our low density initial state , i.e. a transition from phase ( i ) via ( ii ) ; this phase then morphs into a set of asters and spirals , which leave way eventually to a phase ( iii ) which is asymptotically stable . instead , when we cross the transition line , along the black arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we always find travelling actin waves at long timescales . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the wave phase ( large @xmath23 ) , we find waves emerging directly within the uniform phase : these waves are also irregular and peaks are far from each other . </S>",
    "<S> closer to the transition line we typically find spots appear before waves emerge ; waves are also more regular and the separation between peaks can be decreased , for instance , by increasing polymerisation ( hence decreasing @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different dynamics occur since close to the transition line , waves emerge slowly and do not impede spot formation on the pathway from phase ( ii ) to phase ( iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the length scale selection may be linked to the fact that the longest wavelength in the instability band ( where the real part of the dispersion relation is positive ) depends on @xmath8 . for @xmath73 ( orange curve ) </S>",
    "<S> there is an additional transition line in our phase diagram ( dashed lines for grey and brown line ) , representing a parameter domain of large actin fiber density where waves are impossible even for very strong alignment interactions . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this means that wave formation is only possible in our system if self - propulsion is fast enough ; the critical speed is given by a combination of fiber diffusion and alignment saturation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to highlight here the role of polymerisation in our model . </S>",
    "<S> besides guiding the system through successive instabilities as the overall density increases , actin polymerisation plays other major roles in the system . </S>",
    "<S> first , when its rate @xmath8 is large enough , it can suppress pattern formation altogether . </S>",
    "<S> second , close to the instability threshold , the polymerisation rate controls the width of and separation between wave peaks . finally , at least within the range which we have explored , polymerisation is required to create transient spots . </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we have shown that an ensemble of polymerising and treadmilling actin filaments forms a cascade of patterns encompassing spots , spirals and waves , which resemble the typical phenomenology found in experiments . specifically , when _ </S>",
    "<S> dictyostelium _ cells recover from actin depolymerisation , they reassemble their actin cytoskeleton by creating spots which later on transition to waves  @xcite . remarkably , and at variance with previous work , our model can recreate this sequence of patterns without the need to assume any underlying nonlinear biochemistry leading to delay , or oscillatory or activator - inhibitor behaviour . instead , </S>",
    "<S> starting from a low density initial phase , we suggest that polymerisation increases the overall density of actin until locally oriented domains of moving actin flocks appear . </S>",
    "<S> these domains travel along randomly selected directions , and collide with each other to form spirals or larger spots where the filament directions are arranged in an aster shape . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our work demonstrates that spots occur automatically en route from the typical low density initial phase towards the flocking state featuring waves , thereby challenging previous and more complicated mechanisms describing the phenomenology of typical _ in vivo _ actin wave experiments . besides this </S>",
    "<S> , our results might also be useful for designing and understanding minimal _ in vitro _ </S>",
