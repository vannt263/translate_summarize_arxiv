    "the problem of understanding quantum field theories ( qft ) on a finite volume is of great importance both for theoretical interests and for many realistic applications . in particular , it is crucial to explore the possibility of defining a `` form factor representation '' for the correlation functions , in analogy to the infinite volume case @xcite .",
    "there are reasons to expect , in fact , a fast convergent behaviour of these series also for finite volume correlators , as it happens in infinite volume ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "if this would be indeed the case , accurate estimates of finite volume correlators and other related physical quantities , could be obtained by just using few exact terms of their spectral representations , having consequently a great simplification of the problem .",
    "this observation makes clear that it is worth pursuing the research on this topic and looking , in particular , for an efficient scheme of approximation .",
    "it is well known that finite volume quantum field theories are also related to field theories at finite temperature . in 1 + 1",
    "space - time dimensions , this gives the possibility of viewing a qft defined on a finite volume of a cylinder geometry in the alternative picture , in which the space variable is infinite and the ( euclidean ) time variable is instead compactified on a circle of radius @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the temperature of the system ( the so - called matsubara imaginary time formalism ) . in the case of integrable theories , promising exact results have been obtained in @xcite , thanks to the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) technique , which relates the thermodynamical properties of the system to its exact @xmath3-matrix @xcite . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the finite temperature correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the usual form factors , relative to the infinite volume hilbert space , dressed with the so - called `` filling - fractions '' , which encode the thermodynamics of the system . within this approach ,",
    "it has been possible to fully understand the finite temperature one - point functions , while a further analysis seems still necessary for the two - point and higher correlation functions .",
    "coming back to the picture where the time evolution is the usual one while the space variable is compactified , the form factors have to be seen as the matrix elements of local fields between eigenstates of the finite volume hamiltonian . in this case",
    "there is still a poor understanding of the correlation functions behaviour , even in the integrable cases .",
    "it must be stressed that the reason is not only the present undeveloped and unsatisfactory theory for computing finite volume matrix elements .",
    "in fact , contrary to the infinite volume situation , the only knowledge of the form factors is not enough to obtain the correlators in a finite volume since for their computation the energy eigenvalues of the finite volume hamiltonian are also needed . for integrable models , these extra data may be obtained along the lines discussed in @xcite , while for non ",
    "integrable theories one has necessarily to rely on numerical methods , as the one proposed in @xcite for instance .    leaving apart the above problem of energy eigenvalues and concerning instead about the status of the form factors in a finite volume , there are so far only semiclassical results relative to a conformal theory @xcite as well as exact calculations relative to the ising model @xcite ( for a bethe ansatz approach see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "although these findings are very interesting , the techniques employed in the above papers are however strictly related either to the specific integrable structure of the considered models or to the free nature of the majorana fermion field of the ising model . in this paper",
    "we are going to use , instead , a semiclassical approach which does not require integrability and it may be then of more general applicability , of course within its range of approximation . as shown below",
    ", this approach gives in particular the possibility of checking some of the results of our analysis against the exact known quantities in the case of integrable theories in infinite volume , while it permits to have new predictions on the semiclassical regime of the non  integrable ones .",
    "as illustrative examples of this method , we will present its application to two significant models : the integrable qft of the sine - gordon model @xmath4 and the non  integrable qft with a @xmath5 interaction in the broken @xmath6 symmetry phase @xmath7 both these theories display degenerate minima , that can be chosen as the constant classical solution representing the vacuum state around which one decides to quantize the theory .",
    "however , the most interesting classical backgrounds are the kink  type ones , which interpolate between degenerate minima and give rise to a non trivial quantization scheme .",
    "our aim is to define this kind of backgrounds in finite volume and to estimate the relative form factors in an appropriate limit . at the same time , doing so , we will have the possibility of better exploring the properties of the same form factors in the infinite volume case .",
    "the semiclassical quantization of a field theory defined by a potential @xmath8 is based on the identification of a classical background @xmath9 which satisfies the equation of motion @xmath10 in the infinite volume , this can be performed with various well established techniques , like the path integral formalism @xcite or the solution of the field equations in classical background @xcite , usually called the dhn method ( for a systematic review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure is particularly simple and interesting if one considers classical field solutions @xmath9 in 1 + 1 dimensions which are static `` kink '' configurations interpolating between degenerate minima of the potential , and whose quantization gives rise to a particle - like spectrum .",
    "the kink solutions are obtained , firstly , by integrating the first order equation related to ( [ eom ] ) @xmath11 and , secondly , imposing that @xmath9 reaches two different minima of the potential as @xmath12 . in the infinite volume case , these boundary conditions correspond to fixing the constant of integration @xmath13 equal to zero .",
    "as we will show below , finite volume case can be described , on the contrary , by a non  vanishing value of @xmath13 which can be directly related to the size of the system . in the following",
    "we will be interested to discuss qft defined on a cylinder geometry where the time variable is infinite while the space one is compactified on a circle of circumference @xmath14 , with twisted boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath15    a very interesting result , due to goldstone and jackiw @xcite and well explained in @xcite , is that the classical background @xmath9 has the quantum meaning of fourier transform of the form factor of the basic field @xmath16 between kink states between asymptotic states in the space coordinates representation : @xmath17 . ] .",
    "the technique to derive this result relies on the basic hypothesis that the kink momentum is very small compared to its mass , which is indeed inversely proportional to the coupling constant , considered small in the semiclassical regime .",
    "calling @xmath18 and @xmath19 the momenta of the in and out one - kink states , at the leading order in the coupling constant one obtains @xmath20 this important result has , unfortunately , two serious drawbacks : expressing the form factor as a function of the difference of momenta , lorenz covariance is lost and moreover , the antisymmetry under the interchange of momenta makes problematic any attempt to go in the crossed channel and obtain the matrix element between the vacuum and a kink  antikink state .    in order to overcome these problems , we need to refine the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "this can be done by using the rapidity variable @xmath21 of the kink ( and considering it as very small ) , instead of the momentum .",
    "for example , in the @xmath5 theory ( [ phi4pot ] ) , where the kink mass @xmath22 is of order @xmath23 , we will work under the hypothesis that @xmath21 is of order @xmath24 . in this way we get consistently",
    "@xmath25 we can now define the form factor between kink states as the fourier transform with respect to the lorenz invariant rapidity difference @xmath26 : @xmath27 with the inverse fourier transform defined as @xmath28 following the same procedure used by goldstone and jackiw @xcite , i.e. starting from the heisenberg equation of motion for the field @xmath29 @xmath30\\;,\\ ] ] and taking the matrix elements of both sides @xmath31 e^{-i(p_{1}-p_{2})_{\\mu}x^{\\mu}}<p_{1}|\\phi(0)|p_{2 } > \\,=\\,\\ ] ] @xmath32|p_{2}>\\;,\\ ] ] it is easy to show that , at leading order in @xmath24 , the function @xmath33 obeys the same differential equation satisfied by the kink solution , i.e. @xmath34\\;.\\ ] ] this means that we can take @xmath33 to be equal to @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 and adjusting its boundary conditions by an appropriate choice for the value of the constant @xmath13 in eq.([first ] ) .    with the above considerations , it is now possible to express the crossed channel form factor through the variable transformation @xmath37 : @xmath38 the analysis of this quantity in infinite volume allows us , in particular , to get information about the spectrum of the theory .",
    "its dynamical poles , in fact , located at @xmath39 with @xmath40 , coincide with the poles of the kink ",
    "antikink @xmath3-matrix @xcite , and the relative bound states masses can be then expressed as @xmath41 it is worth to note that this procedure for extracting the semiclassical bound states masses is remarkably simpler than the standard dhn method of quantizing the corresponding classical backgrounds , because in general these solutions depend also on time and have a much more complicated structure than the kink ones .",
    "moreover , in non ",
    "integrable theories these backgrounds could even not exist as exact solutions of the field equations : this happens for example in the @xmath5 theory , where the dhn quantization has been performed on some approximate backgrounds @xcite .",
    "once the matrix elements ( [ f2 ] ) are known , one can estimate the leading behaviour in @xmath24 of the spectral function in a regime of the momenta dictated by our assumption of small kink rapidity . in infinite volume",
    "the spectral function @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 and has the form factor expansion @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the delta functions in the above expression make meaningful the use of our form factors , derived in the small @xmath21 approximation , only if we consider a regime in which @xmath46 and @xmath47 and , from now on , we will always understand this restriction . the leading @xmath48 contribution of the various form factors , we refer to the complete discussion in @xcite .",
    "our formalism is slightly different because the @xmath22 factor in front of ( [ ffinf ] ) , which is a natural consequence of considering the rapidity as the basic variable , increases by @xmath23 the order of all form factors in the kink sector with respect to @xcite ; however , since @xmath49 , in the final expression for the spectral function all orders recombine consistently . ] to the spectral function , denoted in the following by @xmath50 , is given by the trivial vacuum term plus the kink - antikink contribution : @xmath51 where the range of integration of the above quantity is of order @xmath52 ( note that , being @xmath53 , the integral can be roughly estimated by evaluating @xmath54 at @xmath55 : this is what we will do in the next sections ) .",
    "the application of this procedure to the finite volume case is straightforward , thanks to the possibility of choosing @xmath33 as a solution of eq.([first ] ) with any constant @xmath13 .",
    "as explicitly shown by the examples discussed in the next sections , this is equivalent to define a kink solution configuration on a finite volume , with the constant @xmath13 directly related to the size of the system .",
    "we have now to consider the matrix elements of @xmath56 between two eigenstates @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the finite volume hamiltonian .",
    "these states can be naturally labelled with the so - called `` quasi - momentum '' variable @xmath59 , which corresponds to the eigenvalues of the translation operator on the cylinder ( multiples of @xmath60 ) , and appears in the space dependent part of eq.([heis ] ) in the case of finite volume .",
    "the tba equations @xcite , valid for large @xmath14 , are exactly a relation between this variable and the free momentum @xmath61 of the infinite volume asymptotic states , through a phase shift @xmath62 which encodes the information about the interaction : @xmath63 defining @xmath64 as the `` quasi - rapidity '' of the kink states by @xmath65 we can now write the form factor at a finite volume by replacing the fourier integral transform with a fourier series expansion : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 since the energy eigenvalues of the finite volume hamiltonian can not be related to the quasi - rapidity as in eq.([rapidity ] ) , in principle we are not allowed to express the crossed channel form factor @xmath69 via the change of variable @xmath37 . however , it is easy to show that in our regime of approximations the deviations of the kink energy from ( [ rapidity ] ) are of higher order in the coupling and can be neglected at this stage .    on the cylinder , the spectral function can be expressed as a series expansion on the form factors : @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the quasi - momenta of the intermediate states , and @xmath73 are the finite volume energy eigenvalues , to be determined by other means ( see the comment in sect.[intro ] ) . in our semiclassical regime , however , this is not necessary : in fact , in order to evaluate the leading contribution @xmath74 , we can consistently approximate the kink energies with their classical values ( of order @xmath23 ) , which can be exactly computed as a function of the volume .",
    "we then have @xmath75 as in the infinite volume case , the consistency of the semi  classical approximation selects as the relevant values of the above series those with @xmath76 and therefore it can can be roughly estimated by simply evaluating @xmath54 at @xmath77 .",
    "it is now interesting to apply these general considerations to the analysis of the form factors of the fundamental field @xmath16 both for an integrable and a non ",
    "integrable qft .",
    "the sine - gordon model , defined in ( [ sgpot ] ) , is an integrable quantum field theory , for which the infinite volume form factors are exactly known @xcite .",
    "the ( anti)soliton background is given by @xmath78 its classical energy is @xmath79 , and the first quantum corrections are known to be of higher order in @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "hence we can consistently approximate the mass @xmath81 with this value and assume that the ( anti)soliton rapidity will be of order @xmath80 .",

    ", the only thing to take into account is that , in the definition of the exact form factor of the fundamental field @xmath16 , the asymptotic two  particle state is actually given by the antisymmetric combination of soliton and antisoliton . since at our level the form factor between antisoliton states is simply @xmath84 we finally obtain @xmath85}\\;,\\ ] ] which indeed coincides with the exact result in the regime @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "a strong motivation for the choice of this function as the ( anti)soliton background on the cylinder can be obtained by analyzing the so - called `` classical energy per kink '' computed in @xcite : @xmath105 = 8\\frac{m}{\\beta^{2}}\\left [ \\textbf{e}(k^{2})-\\frac{1}{2}(1-k^{2})\\textbf{k}(k^{2})\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind . in the @xmath107 limit ( which corresponds to @xmath108 , with @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 approaches exponentially the value @xmath81 ; the expansions of @xmath111 and @xmath112 for small @xmath113 @xcite , compared with @xmath114 lead to the following expansion for large @xmath14 of the classical energy @xmath115 by using the theory of finite volume corrections discussed in @xcite , the behaviour ( [ sgclassenexp ] ) can be put in correspondence with the scattering data of the qft in infinite volume ) , we have only written the term that is relevant in our semiclassical limit , in which the leading contribution to the mass is given by @xmath110 . ] : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the 3-particle on - shell coupling of kink , antikink and elementary boson , whose mass in infinite volume is @xmath118 . using the known expression for the sine - gordon kink - breather @xmath3-matrix @xcite and evaluating the limit @xmath119 of its residue",

    "there is , however , the important conceptual difference that this qft is non  integrable : as we are going to show , this gives us the possibility of estimating quantities of this quantum field theory which were unknown even in the infinite volume case .      the standard ( anti)kink background is given in this case by @xmath131 with classical energy @xmath132 .    with our formulation in terms of the rapidity ,",

    "the identification the kink - antikink bound states masses in infinite volume from the dynamical poles of @xmath69 is a very powerful tool , whose application to other theories is a topic interesting in itself , but can not be directly implemented on the cylinder .",
