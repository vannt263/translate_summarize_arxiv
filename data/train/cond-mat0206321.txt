    "semiconductor devices based on the control and manipulation of electron spin ( semiconductor spintronics ) have recently attracted considerable attention since the discovery of long spin relaxation times and large spin transport distances in semiconductors and various device structures.@xcite in order to design and fabricate high - performance spintronic devices , a comprehensive understanding of spin transport and injection properties of semiconductors and heterostructures is needed .    in theoretical studies of spin transport and injection in semiconductors",
    "@xcite the spin polarization is usually assumed to obey the same diffusion equation as in metals,@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electrochemical potential of up - spin ( down - spin ) electrons . in this diffusion equation , the electric field does not play any role , and spin polarization decays away on a length scale of @xmath3 from an injection point .",
    "this is reasonable for metals because the electric field * e * is essentially screened .",
    "for semiconductor spintronic devices , however , the semiconductor often is lightly doped and nondegenerate , and a moderate electric field can dominate the carrier motion .",
    "in fact , experiments have shown that electric fields can affect spin diffusion in semiconductors dramatically.@xcite    in ref . , we examined the role of electric field on spin transport in nondegenerate semiconductors and derived a drift - diffusion equation for spin polarization , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the deviation of up - spin ( down - spin ) electron density from its equilibrium value , @xmath6 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath7 the temperature .",
    "this equation consistently takes into account electric - field effects and nondegenerate electron statistics .",
    "we identified a high - field diffusive regime which has no analogue in metals .",
    "this regime occurs for field as small as 1 v / cm at low temperatures .",
    "two distinct spin diffusion lengths now characterize spin motion , i.e. , up - stream ( @xmath8 ) and down - stream ( @xmath9 ) spin diffusion lengths .",
    "this is a further example of the analogy @xcite between up / down - spin electron in semiconductor spin transport and majority / minority carriers in semiconductor charge transport , where the presence of electric field also results in two charge diffusion lengths.@xcite we applied this spin drift - diffusion equation to study spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor , and showed that the electric - field effects on spin injection could be described in terms of the two field - induced spin diffusion lengths in the semiconductor .    in this paper , first , we derive a more general drift - diffusion equation of spin polarization valid for both doped semiconductors and metals , and demonstrate the development from eq .",

    "( [ deg ] ) as the system changes from nondegenerate to degenerate .",
    "we establish the relation between the electrochemical potential splitting and density imbalance of up - spin and down - spin electrons in nondegenerate systems , and clarify the two spin polarizations , i.e. , spin polarization of current and spin polarization of density .",
    "we then use the spin drift - diffusion equation for nondegenerate systems , eq .",
    "( [ nondeg ] ) , to analyze several typical one - dimensional device geometries .",
    "we find that high fields also enhance spin injection from a ferromagnet to a semiconductor in structure with a spin - selective barrier .",

    "have considered such a barrier in the low - field regime .",
    "the field enhancement and the interface enhancement of spin injection may reinforce each other to achieve high injection efficiencies in different structures .",
    "next , we study spin injection in sandwiched fm / ns / fm structures with and without spin - selective interfacial barriers . at low fields",
    "the two magnets are equally important to determine spin injection into the semiconductor and the spin injection efficiency is sensitive to the relative orientation of the two magnets .",
    "we find that in the high - field regime , this symmetry is broken and spin injection is locally determined by the magnet from which carriers are injected into the semiconductor .",
    "the spin injection efficiency can be enhanced by orders of magnitude by increasing the electric field for both parallel and anti - parallel orientation of the two magnets .",
    "we further consider fm / ns@xmath0/ns structures , where a highly doped nonmagnetic semiconductor ( ns@xmath0 ) is placed near the magnet interface .",
    "such a configuration is common in structures designed to overcome the schottky barrier between a magnet and a semiconductor , and is intrinsic to fm / inas , where densely occupied surface states form at the interface .",
    "we find that spin injection at the strong - field limit in such a structure is controlled by the total electric current flowing into semiconductors and insensitive to the distinction between semiconductors .",
    "thus high fields can effectively enhance spin injection in such structures as well .",
    "finally we explore electric - field effects on magnetoresistance of a magnetic semiconductor ( ms)/ns / ms structure . a magnetic semiconductor",
    "can have extremely large spin polarization at low temperatures and the magnetization can be easily adjusted by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "a large positive magnetoresistance have been observed in ms / ns / ms structures.@xcite we find that this magnetoresistance collapses in the high - field regime , suggesting a sensitive test of the electric - field effects on spin transport in semiconductors .",

    "<S> in semiconductor spintronic devices , the semiconductor is usually lightly doped and nondegenerate , and moderate electric fields can dominate the carrier motion . </S>",
    "<S> we recently derived a drift - diffusion equation for spin polarization in the semiconductors by consistently taking into account electric - field effects and nondegenerate electron statistics and identified a high - field diffusive regime which has no analogue in metals . here </S>",
    "<S> spin injection from a ferromagnet ( fm ) into a nonmagnetic semiconductor ( ns ) is extensively studied by applying this spin drift - diffusion equation to several typical injection structures such as fm / ns , fm / ns / fm , and fm / ns / ns structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the high - field regime spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor is enhanced by several orders of magnitude . for injection structures with interfacial barriers , </S>",
    "<S> the electric field further enhances spin injection considerably . in fm / ns </S>",
    "<S> / fm structures high electric fields destroy the symmetry between the two magnets at low fields , where both magnets are equally important for spin injection , and spin injection becomes locally determined by the magnet from which carriers flow into the semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the field - induced spin injection enhancement should also be insensitive to the presence of a highly doped nonmagnetic semiconductor ( ns@xmath0 ) at the fm interface , thus fm / ns@xmath0/ns structures should also manifest efficient spin injection at high fields . furthermore , high fields substantially reduce the magnetoresistance observable in a recent experiment on spin injection from magnetic semiconductors . </S>"
