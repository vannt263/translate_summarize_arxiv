    "the no hair theorems in black hole physics state that a black hole is completely characterized by three basic parameters , namely , its mass , angular momentum , and charge .",
    "because of this extreme simplicity , the observational properties of a black hole are determined uniquely by these three intrinsic parameters plus a few details of the surrounding environment .",
    "there is compelling observational evidence that many compact objects exist in the universe , and there are indications that some of these might have horizons @xcite .",
    "however , there is as yet no direct proof that any of these objects is necessarily a black hole .",
    "the dynamical equations describing collapse in general relativity do not imply that the final endstate of gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud has to be a black hole ( see @xcite ) ; other possibilities are also allowed . in the case of a continual collapse , general relativity predicts that a spacetime singularity must form as the endstate of collapse .",
    "however , recent collapse studies show that , depending on the initial conditions from which the collapse evolves , trapped surfaces form either early or late during the collapse . correspondingly , the final singularity may either be covered , giving a black hole , or may be visible as a naked singularity . if astrophysical objects of the latter kind hypothetically form in nature , it is important to be able to distinguish them from their black hole counterparts through observational signatures .",
    "general relativity has never been tested in the very strong field regime , and very little is known about how matter behaves towards the end of the gravitational collapse of a massive star , when extremely large densities are reached and quantum effects possibly become relevant . over the years , it has often been suggested that some exotic stable state of matter might occur below the neutron degeneracy threshold , allowing for the existence of quark stars , or boson stars , or even more exotic astrophysical objects ( see for example @xcite ) .    at present",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that such compact objects do exist . on the other hand ,",
    "the densities and sizes of compact objects in the universe vary enormously , depending on their mass .",
    "while a stellar mass quark star could have a density greater than that of a neutron star , a supermassive compact object at the center of a galaxy might have a density comparable to that of ordinary terrestrial matter .",
    "this means that it is difficult to come up with a single paradigm for all compact objects by simply modifying the equation of state of matter . also , the processes that lead to the formation of stellar mass compact objects are different from those leading to supermassive objects . for one thing ,",
    "time scales are very different .",
    "stellar mass compact objects form in a matter of seconds , when the core of a massive dying star implodes under its own gravity . we know",
    "little about the physical processes that lead to the formation of supermassive compact objects , but whatever it is , it doubtless operates far more slowly than in the stellar - mass case .    in our view",
    "it is important to study viable theoretical models that , under reasonable physical conditions , lead to the formation of different kinds of compact objects , and to investigate the properties of these different end states . in recent times , much attention has been devoted to the observational properties of spacetimes that describe very compact objects or singularities where no horizon is present @xcite .",
    "many valid solutions of einstein field equations exist which describe spacetimes that are not black holes .",
    "these are either vacuum solutions with naked singularities or collapse solutions in the presence of matter .",
    "naked singularity models include the reissner - nordstrom , kerr and kerr - newman geometries with a range of parameter values that differentiate the black hole and naked singularity regimes .",
    "collapse models include dust collapse , models with perfect fluids and those with other equations of state @xcite .",
    "note further that the classical event horizon structure of the kerr metric can be altered in many ways .",
    "one way is by overspinning the kerr black hole in order to obtain a naked singularity @xcite .",
    "another is by introducing deformations or scalar fields to alter the spacetime and thus expose a naked singularity @xcite . although the physical viability of some of these examples is not clear",
    ", the fact remains that classical general relativity allows for the formation of naked singularities in a variety of situations .",
    "if singular solutions represent a breakdown of the theory in the regime of strong gravity , then a study of some of these models might provide clues to new physics .",
    "for example , string theory or quantum gravity corrections can remove the kerr singularity , leaving open the possibility of non singular superspinning solutions @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the present authors showed that equilibrium configurations describing an extended compact object can in principle be obtained from gravitational collapse .",
    "the models we described correspond to a slowly evolving collapsing cloud which settles asymptotically to a static final configuration that is either regular or has a naked singularity at the center . in this context",
    ", a naked singularity must be understood as a region of arbitrarily large density that is approached as comoving time goes to arbitrarily large values .",
    "we briefly examined the properties of accretion disks around the naked singularity solutions .",
    "there were significant physical differences compared to disks around black holes , and it followed that there could be astrophysical signatures that could distinguish black holes from naked singularities .    in the above previous work , we considered the case of purely tangential pressure and vanishing radial pressure . are the solutions we obtained a consequence of this extreme simplification , or are they representative of a generic class of solutions that survive even for more reasonable equations of state ?",
    "we answer this question here at least partly by exploring gravitational collapse of perfect fluid objects with an isotropic pressure . even in this more realistic case",
    ", we find that objects with either regular interiors or naked singularities form readily as a result of gravitational collapse .",
    "we explore the similarities and differences between these new solutions and the earlier solutions which had purely tangential pressure .",
    "our main purpose in the present paper is to investigate whether the naked singularity models derived here and in our previous work can be observationally distinguished from black holes of the same mass .",
    "we therefore take a further step in this direction by calculating the spectral energy distributions of putative accretion disks .",
    "we show that important differences exist in the physical properties of accretion disks around naked singularities compared to those around black holes , which may help us distinguish black holes from naked singularities through observations of astrophysical objects .",
    "although the toy models considered here are unlikely to be realized physically , some general features of these objects are revealed by our analysis and show that naked singularities could be observationally distinguished from black holes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we describe a procedure by which a static perfect fluid object with a schwarzschild exterior metric can be obtained via gravitational collapse from regular initial conditions . in section iii",
    ", we use the above procedure to obtain a toy model of a static final configuration with a naked singularity at the center .",
    "we then describe the properties of accretion disks in this toy spacetime and compare these models to disks around a schwarzschild black hole of the same mass .",
    "we also briefly discuss other density profiles of astrophysical interest that could be studied within the same framework . in the final section iv",
    ", we discuss possible applications to astrophysical observations .",
    "spherical collapse in general relativity can be described by a dynamical spacetime metric of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of the comoving coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for the perfect fluid case ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the einstein equations then take the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes a derivative with respect to comoving radius @xmath5 and @xmath9 denotes a derivative with respect to time @xmath4 in the @xmath10 representation .",
    "the function @xmath11 , called the misner - sharp mass , describes the amount of matter enclosed within the shell labeled by @xmath5 at the time @xmath4 , and is given by @xmath12    equations ( [ p])([misner ] ) give five relations among the six unknown functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we thus have the freedom to specify one free function .",
    "an assumed equation of state relating pressure to energy density during the evolution of the system would fix this remaining freedom and give a closed set of equations .",
    "it could happen , however , that this approach leads to an analytically intractable problem .",
    "moreover , we do not know if the collapsing matter will have the same unchanged equation of state as it evolves to higher and higher densities as the collapse progresses .",
    "there is in fact no astrophysical or mathematical requirement that the equation of state must be fixed as the collapse evolves in time .",
    "we therefore prefer here instead to choose the functional form of @xmath17 , which corresponds implicitly to fixing the equation of state , which could however change with time and space coordinates .",
    "we choose a scenario such that we approximate some standard equation of state at early times , switching to some other , possibly exotic , kind of matter at later times .",
    "we use the scaling degree of freedom in the definition of @xmath2 to fix the initial condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial time . to describe collapse we require @xmath21 , which guarantees that @xmath2 decreases monotonically with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "hence , we may change coordinates from @xmath10 to @xmath22 , thus in effect considering @xmath23 .",
    "correspondingly , we can view the original function @xmath17 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath2 and write @xmath24 . in the following , we use @xmath25 to denote a derivative with respect to @xmath5 in the @xmath22 representation , i.e. , @xmath26    the total mass of the system",
    "is not conserved during collapse , unless one requires the further condition that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the boundary of the system .",
    "therefore , we can not in general match a collapse solution to an exterior schwarzschild metric .",
    "however , matching to a generalized vaidya spacetime at the boundary @xmath29 is always possible @xcite .    the procedure to solve the above system of einstein equations is the following .",
    "we choose the free function @xmath30 globally and use equations and to obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 as functions of @xmath5 , @xmath2 and its derivatives .",
    "we then integrate equation to obtain @xmath1 , @xmath33 and integrate equation to obtain @xmath3 , @xmath34 the free function @xmath35 results from the integral in equation ; it is related to the velocity profile in the collapsing cloud .",
    "the integral in equation again gives a free function of @xmath4 , but this can be absorbed via a redefinition of the time coordinate .",
    "once we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of @xmath5 , @xmath2 and its derivatives , we can integrate the misner - sharp mass equation that becomes a differential equation involving @xmath2 and its derivatives .",
    "we can write it in the form @xmath38 and its integration gives @xmath39 , or equivalently @xmath18 thus solving the system .",
    "substituting equations and in equation , the metric of the collapsing spacetime takes the form @xmath40 it may not always be possible to fully integrate the system of einstein equations globally .",
    "however , this is not always needed , because by considering the behaviour of the functions involved , it is often possible to extract useful information about collapse and to integrate the solution at least in a neighborhood close to the center .",
    "typically some restrictions are required in order for the collapse model to be considered physically viable .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "absence of shell crossing singularities , which arise from a breakdown of the coordinate system at locations where collapsing shells intersect .",
    "this requirement implies @xmath41 .",
    "we note in this connection that there is always a neighborhood of the central line @xmath42 of the collapsing cloud which contains no shell - crossing singularities throughout the collapse evolution @xcite .",
    "energy conditions , of which the usual minimal requirement is the weak energy condition , viz .",
    ", positivity of the energy density ( @xmath43 ) and of the sum of density and pressure ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this requires @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "regularity at the center during collapse before the formation of the singularity .",
    "this includes the requirements that forces and pressure gradients vanish at the center and that the energy density has no cusps at @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding requirements are @xmath47 near @xmath42 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "4 .   absence of trapped surfaces at the initial time .",
    "this last requirement is given by positivity of @xmath50_{t = t_i}$ ] and translates to @xmath51 .",
    "our aim now is to construct a dynamical collapse evolution such that the pressure eventually balances gravitational attraction and the collapsing object settles into a static configuration .",
    "such a scenario is of course not always possible in gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud , and there are matter configurations that can only collapse indefinitely without achieveing any possible equilibrium .",
    "such is the case of collapse of a pressureless dust cloud @xcite , or similar systems where pressure is very insignificant .",
    "another possibility in collapse is that the cloud bounces back after reaching a minimum radius .",
    "typically , since we begin with a collapsing configuration , for each shell labeled by the comoving radius @xmath5 , three different behaviours are possible :    1 .",
    "collapse : @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 is negative at all times the shell will collapses to a central singularity .",
    "bounce : @xmath54 at a certain time , with @xmath55 at this time .",
    "the shell bounces back and re - expands .",
    "equilibrium configuration : @xmath56 . here",
    "the collapse slows down and the shell achieves a static configuration .",
    "shells that achieve an equilibrium configuration in a certain sense mark the separation between the region that collapses indefinitely and the region that eventually bounces back @xcite .",
    "both collapse and bounce would occur typically very rapidly , on a dynamical time scale which is proportional to the mass . even in the case of supermassive compact objects ,",
    "this time is much shorter than other typical time scales .",
    "it would appear that all three possibilities above represent generic behavior during gravitational collapse , depending on the masses and velocities of the collapsing shells and the physical scenario involved in collapse .",
    "for example , for a very massive star , an indefinite collapse would seem inevitable if the star can not shed away enough of its mass in a very short collapse time scale to achieve any possible equilibrium . on the other hand , for a much larger mass scale such as galactic or yet larger scales , the collapse could proceed much more slowly and even arrive at an equilibrium to form a stable massive object .",
    "it is well known of course that gravitational collapse plays a key role in the formation of large scale structures in the universe . in many such cases ,",
    "an evolving collapse would slow down , eventually to form a stable massive object . in such cases ,",
    "scenarios such as the one considered here could be relevant .",
    "we note that in order to achieve an equilibrium object as the endstate of collapse or in order to have a useful quasi - equilibrium configuration , it is necessary that each collapsing shell in the cloud must individually achieve the condition @xmath56 .",
    "such an object can be well approximated by a static configuration .",
    "the equation of motion can be written in terms of @xmath2 , for any fixed comoving radius @xmath5 , in the form of an effective potential : @xmath57    we already know that no static configuration is possible for the pressureless ( dust ) case , where @xmath58 is negative at all times . when there is pressure , it is still possible for @xmath58 to be negative at all times , giving continued collapse . however , other possibilities are also allowed since at any given time @xmath4 each shell @xmath5 can be either collapsing , expanding or still giving rise to a wide array of scenarios .",
    "we shall consider here the simple but very common case where @xmath58 , as a function of @xmath2 for fixed @xmath5 , is a polynomial of second order in @xmath2 .",
    "we see that one generic possibility in this case is that @xmath58 has two distinct zeroes . in this case",
    ", the shell will bounce at a finite radius and re - expand .",
    "another possibility is that the two zeroes of @xmath58 coincide ( namely @xmath58 has one root of double multiplicity ) corresponding to an extremum at @xmath59 . in this case , the shell will coast ever more slowly towards the radius corresponding to @xmath59 and will halt without bouncing having reached such radius with zero velocity and zero acceleration as @xmath4 goes to infinity . a global static configuration for this form of the potential is then achieved only if each shell satisfies the condition that it has one double root .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the velocity of the cloud during collapse is always non - zero and therefore such an equilibrium configuration can be achieved only in a limiting sense , as the comoving time @xmath4 goes to infinity ( for a more detailed discussion on the condition leading to equilibrium see @xcite ) . for more general forms of the potential the allowed regions of dynamics for the shell and its behaviour are decided by the multiplicity of the roots of @xmath58 .",
    "the condition that the spacetime evolves towards an equilibrium configuration is thus @xmath60 which is equivalent to @xmath61 from equation we find @xmath62    the system achieves an equilibrium configuration if the solution of the equation of motion , given by @xmath63 , tends asymptotically to an equilibrium solution @xmath64 such that the conditions given in equations or are satisfied .",
    "therefore , in order to have @xmath65 { } r_e(r),\\ ] ] we must choose the free function @xmath30 in the dynamical collapse scenario such that the quantities @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 tend to their respective equilibrium limits : @xmath66 imposing the conditions , we thus obtain two equations which fix the behaviour of @xmath3 and @xmath67 at equilibrium : @xmath68 where the velocity profile @xmath35 in equation has been absorbed into @xmath69 .",
    "note that at equilibrium the area radius @xmath2 becomes a monotonic increasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore if we define the new radial coordinate @xmath70 at equilibrium as @xmath71 we can rewrite the functions at equilibrium as @xmath72 then , from equations and , two of the einstein equations for a static source become @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes a derivative with respect to the new static radial coordinate @xmath70 . the second equation is the well known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation . the third static einstein equation , namely @xmath75 is obtained from equation by imposing the equilibrium condition and making use of equation at equilibrium .",
    "the metric at equilibrium then becomes the familiar static spherically symmetric spacetime , @xmath76 this interior metric is matched to a schwarzschild vacuum exterior at the boundary @xmath77 . by matching @xmath78 at the matching radius @xmath79 and making use of equation , we see that the total gravitational mass @xmath80 of the interior is given by @xmath81    note that , in principle , the interior metric in equation need not be regular at the center , as the eventual singularity is achieved as the result of collapse from regular initial data .",
    "a singularity at the center of the static final configuration is then interpreted as a region of arbitrarily high density that is achieved asymptotically as the comoving time @xmath4 goes to arbitrarily large values .",
    "therefore when considering static interiors with a singularity we are in fact approximating a slowly evolving configuration , where shells have typically very ` small ' velocities and where the central region can reach very high densities .",
    "typically , for a static perfect fluid source of the schwarzschild geometry , various conditions could be required in order to ensure physical reasonability @xcite .",
    "some of these are : the matter satisfies an energy condition , matching conditions with the exterior schwarzschild geometry , vanishing of the pressure at the boundary , monotonic decrease of the energy density and pressure with increasing radius , sound speed within the cloud should be smaller than the speed of light . if the energy conditions are satisfied during collapse , they will be satisfied by the equilibrium configuration as well , i.e. , the positivity of the energy density and sum of density and pressure at the origin follows from the same condition during collapse . also , requiring only the weak energy condition allows the possibility of negative pressures either during the collapse phase or in the final equilibrium configuration .    since we have required here the static configuration to evolve from regular initial data , we may omit the condition that the final state must be necessarily regular at the center .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that a central singularity might develop as the equilibrium is reached , where the singularity has to be understood in the sense explained above .",
    "absence of trapped surfaces at the initial time ensures that , if a singularity develops , it will not be covered by a horizon @xcite .",
    "in fact it can be shown that if trapped surfaces do form at a certain time as the cloud evolves , then the collapse can not be halted and the whole cloud must collapse to a black hole or to a singularity where the first point of singularity is visible but the later portions of the singularity become covered in a black hole .",
    "we note that some of the above conditions , although desirable , may be neglected in special cases .",
    "many interior solutions are available in the literature describing a static sphere of perfect fluid matching smoothly to a schwarzschild exterior geometry ( see @xcite for a list of solutions or @xcite for an algorithm to construct interior solutions ) .",
    "as discussed above , we can construct dynamically evolving collapse scenarios that lead asymptotically to the formation of such static configurations .",
    "if we are able to achieve a static configuration from collapse from regular initial data , and if we view a singularity as a region where density increases to arbitrarily high values , signaling a breakdown of the ability of general relativity to model the spacetime , we may then neglect the requirement of regularity at the center .",
    "in the following , we look for static interiors with a singularity at the origin .",
    "we wish to investigate the properties of such solutions and to establish whether such hypothetical naked singularity objects could in principle be distinguished in terms of observational signatures from black hole counter - parts of the same mass .",
    "we start with the most general static spherically symmetric metric written in the form given in equation .",
    "as we have seen , the perfect fluid source einstein equations give @xmath82-\\frac{\\mathrm{f}(\\rho)}{\\rho^3 } ,      \\\\",
    "p_{,\\rho } & = & -(\\epsilon+p)\\phi_{,\\rho},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have absorbed the factor @xmath83 into the definition of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and defined @xmath86 .",
    "the third ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ) equation , combined with the second equation , gives @xmath87 } { 2\\rho\\left[\\rho-\\mathrm{f}(\\rho)\\right]}.\\ ] ] since the above system of einstein equations consists of three equations with four unknowns , in order to close the system we can either specify an equation of state that relates @xmath85 to @xmath84 or use the freedom to choose arbitrarily one of the other functions @xcite . as discussed earlier , we opt for the latter approach and specify the form of the mass profile @xmath88 , which describes the final mass distribution obtained from collapse . once we specify @xmath89 , equation reduces to a first - order ordinary differential equation , which we can solve .",
    "we follow the same procedure that we used in the pure tangential pressure case @xcite and obtain a solution of the form @xmath90 by equation , this solution corresponds to a total mass @xmath80 given by @xmath91 hence , to avoid a horizon , we require @xmath92 . solving the first einstein equation , the energy density becomes @xmath93 which clearly diverges as @xmath94 , indicating the presence of a strong curvature singularity at the center .",
    "the tov equation now becomes @xmath95 which can be integrated by defining the auxiliary parameter @xmath96 clearly , we require @xmath97 , or equivalently @xmath98 ( for values of @xmath99 similar considerations apply with @xmath100 but we do not consider this case here ) . in terms of @xmath101 , the solution of equation can be written as @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "then , solving the remaining einstein equation gives @xmath105 this solution , among other similar interior static solutions , was first investigated by tolman in 1939 for a specific choice of @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the solution may be rewritten as @xmath106 the existence of a strong curvature singularity at the center can be confirmed by an analysis of the kretschmann scalar @xmath107 near @xmath108 , which gives @xmath109 which is clearly singular in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "the static metric of the above solution takes the form @xmath110 it is matched at the boundary @xmath79 to a vacuum schwarzschild spacetime with total mass @xmath111 . since @xmath78 in the interior is a constant , the matching will not in general be smooth , though it will be continuous . from the matching conditions for @xmath78 and @xmath112 at the boundary we obtain , @xmath113 for all values of @xmath114 , the pressure is maximum at the center and decreases outwards , becoming zero at a finite radius @xmath115 given by @xmath116",
    "since we require the pressure to vanish at the boundary of the cloud , we obtain the further condition @xmath117 , which , together with equation , fixes the two integration constants @xmath103 and @xmath104 : @xmath118    the sound speed inside the cloud is given by @xmath119 .",
    "we find @xmath120 from which we see that @xmath121 , as required , and @xmath122 decreases as the radius @xmath70 goes from @xmath123 to @xmath79 .",
    "we may also rewrite the above relations in the form of an equation of state , @xmath124 , @xmath125    in the limit @xmath126 , corresponding to @xmath127 , we obtain the most compact member of the above family of solutions .",
    "it has an equation of state @xmath128 and hence sound speed @xmath129 .",
    "note , however , that at the outer boundary , @xmath130 but @xmath84 does not vanish , so the equation of state is not strictly isothermal . for this solution ,",
    "the matching radius with the schwarzschild exterior is at @xmath131 , i.e. , twice the schwarzschild radius . in the case of pure tangential pressure , which we considered in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found physically meaningful solutions down to @xmath132 , and even more compact solutions with exotic properties .",
    "this is one respect in which the perfect fluid model differs from the tangential pressure case .    for @xmath133",
    ", corresponding to @xmath134 , we obtain an equation of state @xmath135 which approaches the radiation equation of state @xmath136 as @xmath137 . for this model , @xmath138 , i.e.",
    ", the object is a little less compact than the model with @xmath126 .",
    "finally , the case @xmath139 , @xmath140 , corresponds to @xmath141 , and hence an infinitely large object . in this limit",
    ", our solution reduces to the classical newtonian singular isothermal sphere solution .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and the metric in equation reduces to the metric of flat space .    considering next the energy conditions , it is easy to see that @xmath144 implies positivity of the energy density and pressure . the pressure decreases from its maximum value at the center to zero at the boundary . from @xmath145",
    "we see that the weak energy condition is satisfied throughout the interior of the cloud .",
    "we wish to investigate basic observational properties of accretion disks orbiting in the above family of spacetimes . to this end , we study circular geodesics .",
    "our assumption is that a test particle orbiting inside the `` cloud '' does not interact with the material of the cloud but merely feels its gravitational influence .",
    "our perfect fluid model has five parameters , @xmath80 , @xmath101 , @xmath79 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and there are three matching conditions at the boundary @xmath146 , viz . , matching of @xmath112 and @xmath78 with the exterior schwarzschild metric and the condition @xmath147 .",
    "thus , we are free to choose two of the five parameters . for convenience , in the following",
    "we choose the total gravitational mass of the cloud @xmath80 to be equal to unity .",
    "this still leaves one free parameter , which we choose to be @xmath101 .",
    "once we pick a value of @xmath101 , the boundary radius @xmath79 is given by equation ( [ rhob ] ) , and the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 are given by equations ( [ acoeff ] ) and ( [ bcoeff ] ) .",
    "given the spherical symmetry of the metric we can always choose the coordinate @xmath148 such that the geodesic under consideration lies in the equatorial plane ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "time - like geodesics in this plane satisfy @xmath150 where @xmath151 .    from the two killing vectors , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , associated with time - translational symmetry and rotational symmetry ,",
    "we can calculate two conserved quantities , the energy per unit mass , @xmath154 , and the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath155 . for circular geodesics we must have @xmath156 .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows spectra corresponding to the same models considered in figure [ fig4 ] . for a given accretion rate @xmath191 , the schwarzschild black hole model gives a much lower luminosity than the naked singular models .",

    "more interesting is the fact that the spectra have noticeably different shapes . at low frequencies ,",
    "all the models have the same spectral shape @xmath235 , which is the standard result for disk emission from large non - relativistic radii @xcite . however , there are dramatic differences at high frequencies .",
    "the emission from a disk around a schwarzschild black hole cuts off at the isco radius @xmath164 .",
    "correspondingly , there is a certain maximum temperature for the emitted radiation , which causes the spectrum to cutoff abruptly at a frequency @xmath236 somewhat below unity .",
    "the two perfect fluid singular models , on the other hand , behave very differently . in these models , the disk extends all the way down to @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the temperature @xmath237 of the emitted radiation rises steadily and diverges as @xmath94 .",

    "as figure [ fig5 ] shows , the high - frequency power - law segment of the spectrum carries a substantial fraction ( more than half ) of the total emission from disks around our naked singularity models .",
    "the presence of this strong power - law spectrum is thus a characteristic feature of these models which can be used to distinguish them qualitatively from disks around black holes .",
    "several well - known astrophysical black hole candidates are known to have spectra with a strong thermal cutoff , similar to that seen in the dotted line in figure [ fig5 ] @xcite .",
    "these systems show very little power - law emission at high frequencies . in these cases",
    "at least we can state with some confidence that the central mass does not have a naked singularity of the sort discussed in this paper .      in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we considered a relatively restricted model in which the fluid in the cloud has non - zero pressure only in the tangential direction . because of vanishing radial pressure , matching pressure across the boundary radius @xmath79 between the cloud and the external schwarzschild spacetime was trivial , and hence the solution was more easily determined . for radii inside the cloud ,",
    "the metric of the pure tangential pressure model takes the form , @xmath240 with @xmath241 and @xmath242 , where @xmath80 is the total gravitational mass of the cloud as measured in the vacuum exterior .",
    "the close similarity of the tangential pressure model and the perfect fluid model described in the present paper is obvious , e.g. , compare the above expressions with equations ( [ metric - sol ] ) and ( [ mt2 ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath243 in the tangential pressure model plays the role of @xmath101 for the perfect fluid case , and in both cases this parameter determines the compactness of the cloud as measured by its dimensionless radius @xmath244 . the limits @xmath140 and @xmath139 in the two models correspond to infinitely large and dilute clouds that are fully non - relativistic : @xmath245 . in this limit ,",
    "the two models are essentially identical .",
    "one minor difference between the models occurs in the opposite limit . for the perfect fluid cloud , the most compact configuration we find has @xmath246 , which corresponds to @xmath131 .",
    "in contrast , for the tangential pressure model , the most compact physically valid configuration has @xmath247 , which corresponds to @xmath132 , i.e. , a more compact object .",
    "another difference between the two models is that the tangential pressure cloud has a particularly straightforward metric in which @xmath248 varies with radius as a simple power - law .",
    "therefore , all quantities behave as power - laws and the analysis is easy . in the case of the perfect fluid model , the extra matching condition on the pressure at @xmath146 results in the metric coefficient @xmath112 involving two power - laws .",
    "the term involving the coefficient @xmath103 in equation  ( [ metric - sol ] ) dominates as @xmath94 and behaves just like the lone power - law term in the tangential pressure cloud case .",
    "the second term involving @xmath104 is required in order to satisfy the pressure boundary condition and plays a role only as @xmath70 approaches @xmath79 .",
    "this term causes various quantities like @xmath165 , @xmath182 , @xmath188 , etc . to deviate from perfect power - law behavior as @xmath249 ( see figs .",
    "as far as observables are concerned the two models behave quite similarly . in figs .",
    "4 and 5 , the two perfect fluid models with @xmath178 and @xmath169 have boundaries at @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively , and their properties are shown by the solid lines . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed lines show results for two tangential pressure models with @xmath250 and @xmath251 which have boundaries at the same radii , @xmath202 , @xmath203 . while the agreement between the two sets of models is not perfect , as is to be expected since the models are different , we see very good qualitative agreement . in particular , note that , just as in the perfect fluid models , the tangential pressure models too produce a strong power - law high energy tail in the spectra of their accretion disks ( fig .  5 ) , which may be used to distinguish these models from disks around a schwarzschild black hole ( dotted line ) .",
    "a simple and commonly used model in astrophysics is the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "this is a spherically symmetric self - gravitating object with an equation of state @xmath252 , where @xmath85 is the pressure , @xmath84 is the density ( this is usually called @xmath70 but we use @xmath84 here since we have already defined @xmath70 to be the radius ) , and @xmath122 is the isothermal sound speed . the model satisfies the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium under the action of newtonian gravity .",
    "the solution is @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the mass interior to radius @xmath70 .",
    "the variations of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath255 with @xmath70 are very reminiscent of the variation of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath11 in the perfect fluid relativistic cloud model described earlier .",
    "one deficiency of the basic singular isothermal sphere model is that it extends to infinite radius , where the mass is infinite . in order to obtain an object with a finite radius",
    ", one needs to change the equation of state such that the pressure goes to zero at a finite density .",
    "this is easily arranged as follows : @xmath256 where @xmath79 is the radius of the boundary and @xmath257 is the density at that radius .",
    "circular orbits inside a singular isothermal sphere behave very simply , with velocity and angular momentum given by @xmath258 the constancy of @xmath259 is the chief attraction of the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "it provides a simple way of reproducing the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "the scaling of @xmath182 with @xmath70 in the singular isothermal sphere is exactly the same as the variation of @xmath182 with @xmath70 in the perfect fluid relativistic cloud . at first sight",
    "it appears that the flat rotation curve property is not reproduced in the relativistic model .",
    "for example , @xmath260 scales as @xmath261 . however , note that @xmath188 is defined as @xmath262 , where @xmath4 is the time measured at infinity .",
    "the appropriate quantity to consider is @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is time measured by a local zamo ( zero angular momentum observer ) at radius @xmath70 .",
    "the two times are related by a factor of @xmath265^{1/2}$ ] which varies as @xmath266 in the limit @xmath219 .",
    "thus , for zamos , the rotation velocity is indeed independent of radius in the deep interior of the cloud .",
    "( close to the boundary , there are small deviations because of the term involving @xmath104 in @xmath267 ) .",
    "consider next the energy of circular orbits in the singular isothermal sphere model .",
    "if we include the rest mass energy and add to it the orbital kinetic energy and the potential energy , then a newtonian calculation gives for the energy of a particle of unit mass @xmath268 the weak logarithmic divergence at small radii is rarely a problem since we generally have @xmath269 .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of the logarithm implies that , in principle , at a sufficiently small radius , the newtonian model predicts a _ negative _ total energy for the particle .",
    "this is clearly unphysical .",
    "it is reassuring that the logarithmic divergence is not present in our relativistic cloud models .",
    "both the pefect fluid model and the tangential pressure model have @xmath165 varying as a power - law with radius : @xmath172 for the perfect fluid case and @xmath270 for the tangential pressure case . in both cases",
    ", @xmath165 asymptotes precisely to zero as @xmath219 and does not go negative anywhere .",
    "effectively , the relativistic models , being more self - consistent , regularize the logarithm of the newtonian model by replacing it with a power - law . the index of the power - law is nearly 0 in the newtonian limit but becomes as large as unity for the maximally compact configuration , viz . , @xmath271 and @xmath272 for the perfect fluid and tangential pressure models , respectively .      as we have seen above",
    ", the perfect fluid relativistic model described in this paper is equivalent to the newtonian singular isothermal sphere model used in astrophysics .",
    "the relativistic generalization was obtained by assuming that the energy density @xmath273 in the relativistic model has the same functional form as @xmath273 in the newtonian model ( compare eqs .",
    "[ epsilon2 ] and [ sis2 ] ) , and then solving for the pressure @xmath85 and the spacetime metric .",
    "this procedure can be followed with any other trial model of @xmath273 of interest .",
    "one simple example is to consider a superposition of the toy perfect fluid model described in this paper with the well known constant density schwarzschild interior .",
    "the density profile then takes the form @xmath274 which corresponds to @xmath275 the density in this model approaches the singular interior of our perfect fluid model as @xmath219 but resembles a constant density interior with @xmath276 as @xmath277 .",
    "it turns out that the tov equation can be explicitly integrated in this case , though the expression for @xmath85 is fairly complicated and involves hypergeometric functions .",
    "other examples of more interest to astrophysics could be similarly considered .",
    "one natural generalization of the singular isothermal sphere is the jaffe density profile @xcite , @xmath278 where @xmath243 is a constant and @xmath279 describes the characteristic radius of the object .",
    "this density profile corresponds to @xmath280 the jaffe model behaves just like the singular isothermal sphere as @xmath94 , yet it has a finite total mass given by @xmath243 and hence does not need to be artifically truncated as we had to in the case of the singular isothermal sphere . the jaffe model is a special case of a more general class of models , the dehnen density profile @xcite , @xmath281 the jaffe profile corresponds to @xmath282 , while the case with @xmath283 is known as the hernquist model @xcite .",
    "the dehnen profile implies a mass function @xmath284 finally , we could also consider the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite , which is given by @xmath285 where again @xmath243 is a constant .",
    "this model has a logarithmically diverging mass as @xmath286 , and is thus a little less attractive .",
    "it is not easy to solve the tov equations for the pressure @xmath85 and the spacetime metric of any of the above models analytically .",
    "however , numerical solutions are easily obtained .",
    "note that all these popular models technically have naked singularities at their centers .",
    "obtaining relativistic generalizations along the lines followed in this paper would be worthwhile .",
    "in the present paper we considered a self - bound spherical cloud of perfect fluid and derived static non - vacuum solutions of the einstein equations which posseses a central naked singularity .",
    "we showed that these solutions could be obtained asymptotically as the final result of the slow collapse of a massive matter cloud . the solutions described here closely parallel those we obtained in @xcite for a fluid with pure tangential pressure .",
    "we studied the properties of steady thermal accretion disks in our naked singularity spacetimes .",
    "focusing on those models that have a disk extending continuously from a large radius @xmath70 down to @xmath94 , i.e. , models with @xmath287 for the perfect fluid case and @xmath288 for the tangential pressure case , we showed that accretion disk spectra would consist of a multi - temperature blackbody at low frequencies joining smoothly to a power - law at high frequencies .",
    "notably , the disk luminosity would be dominated by the high - energy tail , which is a characteristic feature of these models .",
    "the spectrum of an equivalent accretion disk around a black hole would have only the low - frequency multi - temperature blackbody component and would be missing the high frequency tail ( or at best have a weak tail ) .",
    "accretion disks around astrophysical black hole candidates do show power - law tails , but these are usually interpreted as coronal emission from hot gas above the disk . in those cases where the disk emission is definitely thermal , e.g. , in the so - called thermal state of accreting stellar - mass black holes @xcite , the spectrum is invariably dominated by the low - frequency multi - temperature emission and the power - law tail tends to be quite weak .",
    "a number of stellar - mass black holes have been observed in the thermal state @xcite . in the case of these systems",
    "at least we may conclude that the central compact objects are not naked singularities of the type discussed in the present paper ; the objects are presumably true black holes .",
    "however , it is not possible to state anything with certainty in the case of other black hole candidates that have not been observed in the thermal state .",
    "the existence of horizons in stellar mass astrophysical sources has been a matter of discussion in recent years ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some observations suggest that the departure of such objects from black holes must be very small @xcite .",
    "all the same , when it comes to more massive sources , excess luminosity from ultra luminous x - ray sources can not at present be explained fully by the usual black hole accretion disk models and seem to require the existence of as yet undiscovered intermediate mass black holes @xcite .",
    "since there is a strong thermal cutoff at high frequencies present in the spectrum of the black hole models while it is absent in the perfect fluid naked singularity models studied here , this strenghtens the argument that the astrophysical sources that exhibit the same behaviour would be black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "ultra luminous sources exist in the universe and at present it is not clear if it will be possible to fit all the observations within the black hole paradigm .",
    "it is possible that different kinds of sources exist in nature , besides black holes , stars and neutron stars .",
    "these could be of the singular type discussed here or could be regular objects composed of ordinary or exotic matter .",
    "all these could possibly form from collapse processes as described here and they would have their distinctive observational features ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the comparison and models such as the ones discussed here may be useful to understand better and analyze future observations .    for the toy models presented here we found that the radiant energy flux and the spectral energy distribution are much greater as compared to a black hole of the same mass , and therefore we obtained indications that if some sources of similar kind do exist in the universe it might be possible to distinguish them observationally from black holes .",
    "we also found here that the qualitative features described in @xcite are preserved when we consider perfect fluid sources , instead of sources sustained only by tangential stresses .",
    "we can therefore conjecture that the increased flux and luminosity may be a generic feature of any source with a singularity at the center where the accretion disk can in principle extend until @xmath42 .",
    "as it is known , perfect fluids are important in the context of astrophysics as they can be used to model many sources and objects of astrophysical relevance .",
    "of course , different matter models will imply different luminosity spectrums that might or might not eventually be distinguished from one another .    finally , we note that these models require a certain fine tuning since all the collapsing shells must have the right velocity so that the effective potential leads asymptotically to @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless the class of static final configurations can be understood in the sense of an idealized approximation for a slowly evolving cloud with small velocities . in this sense",
    "these scenarios appear to be generic as they approximate a wide variety of slowly evolving matter clouds .",

    "<S> we show that , in principle , a slowly evolving gravitationally collapsing perfect fluid cloud can asymptotically settle to a static spherically symmetric equilibrium configuration with a naked singularity at the center . </S>",
    "<S> we consider one such asymptotic final configuration with a finite outer radius , and construct a toy model in which it is matched to a schwarzschild exterior geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the properties of circular orbits in this model . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate observational signatures of a thermal accretion disk in this spacetime , comparing them with the signatures expected for a disk around a black hole of the same mass . </S>",
    "<S> several notable differences emerge . </S>",
    "<S> a disk around the naked singularity is much more luminous than one around an equivalent black hole . also , the disk around the naked singularity has a spectrum with a high frequency power law segment that carries a major fraction of the total luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at least some naked singularities can , in principle , be distinguished observationally from black holes of the same mass . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible implications of these results . </S>"
