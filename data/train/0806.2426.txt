    "the estimation of a probability of the form @xmath1 starts to be challenging as soon as @xmath2 is large , since the conditional empirical distribution becomes useless when no observations are available .",
    "a fruitful alternative approach consists in studying , if it exists , the limiting distribution of the random vector @xmath0 conditionally on @xmath3 being large .",

    "this assumption has been called a `` conditional extreme value '' ( cev ) model by @xcite .",
    "some of its main consequences were thoroughly investigated by @xcite and its relationship to standard bivariate extreme value theory has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "in particular , condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) does not imply that the distribution of @xmath0 belongs to the domain of attraction of a bivariate extreme value distribution .",
    "examples of random vectors which are not in the domain of attraction of a bivariate extreme value distribution and still satisfy condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) are given in @xcite and @xcite ( see section 3.1 therein for a related discussion ) .",
    "the classical bivariate extreme value condition means that there exist normalizing functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a bivariate extreme value distribution @xmath14 such that @xmath15 the function @xmath16 can always be chosen such that @xmath17 , and then it is easily seen that @xmath18 two cases are possible : either the limiting distribution @xmath14 is in product form or it is not in product form . in extreme value theory ,",
    "the former case is referred to as asymptotic independence , and the latter is referred to as asymptotic dependence . in the case of asymptotic dependence ,",
    "then @xmath19 is a non degenerate distribution function , and the cev condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) holds .",
    "thus the problem is entirely solved by the standard extreme value theory in the case of asymptotic dependence . in the case of asymptotic independence ,",
    "i.e. @xmath20 , then @xmath21 , so that the limit is degenerate with respect to @xmath22 . in the case of asymptotic independence ,",
    "standard bivariate extreme value theory is useless to check the cev condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) . to summarize this discussion",
    ", it appears that the cev model  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) is potentially useful when the standard bivariate extreme value condition  ( [ eq : ev ] ) does not hold or when condition  ( [ eq : ev ] ) holds with asymptotic independence .",
    "it must be noted that the cev condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) always holds when @xmath23 are independent , @xmath4 is non - degenerate and @xmath3 is in the domain of attraction of a univariate extreme value distribution .",
    "this implies that all bivariate distributions @xmath9 that can be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a univariate extreme value distribution and @xmath26 is _ any _ non - degenerate distribution function can appear as a limiting distribution in  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) .",
    "this trivial consideration has the consequence that it is very difficult to have a general theory for the conditional extreme value model and to define statistical procedures valid in all cases .",
    "rather , it is necessary to study classes of bivariate distributions that satisfy the cev condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) and to establish statistical procedures suited to these classes .",
    "models for which condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) holds have already been investigated in many references .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proved that  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) holds for spherical distributions ; bivariate elliptical distributions were investigated by @xcite , multivariate elliptical distributions and related distributions by @xcite @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the underlying geometric structure ( ellipticity of the level sets of the densities ) has lead to various generalizations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent review on the subject .",
    "an important finding of these works is that when the cev condition is a consequence of such geometric properties , the domain of attraction of the conditioning variable determines the nature of the limiting distribution @xmath9 in  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) .",
    "for instance , for the usual bivariate elliptical distributions , if the conditioning variable has a regularly varying right tail , then the limiting distribution @xmath9 is not in product form , whereas it is in product form if the conditioning variable is in the domain of attraction of the gumbel law . other types of models that satisfy assumption  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) have been studied in @xcite , @xcite .    the aim of this paper is the statistical estimation of the functions @xmath7 and @xmath6 that appear in ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) , as well as the limiting distribution function @xmath9 .",
    "two problems are considered .",
    "the first one is the nonparametric estimation of the limiting distribution and of the normalizing functions .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : npestim ] in full generality .",
    "we only assume that the cev condition  ( [ eq : loi - limite ] ) holds and some additional moment conditions which are necessary to obtain consistency of the estimators . in order to obtain central limit theorems",
    ", we also need to assume some kind of second order conditions .",
    "as discussed above , it seems impossible to go beyond these results without making some restrictive assumptions . from section  [ sec : product ] onwards , we assume that the conditioning variable is in the maximum domain of attraction of the gumbel law , and that the limiting joint distribution @xmath9 has product form .",
    "this choice leaves out many interesting cases , but is motivated by previous works and has not been considered yet in a statistical study . under these assumptions ,",
    "we validate a kolmogorov - smirnov type test for the limiting distribution of the @xmath4 variable , e.g. the standard gaussian distribution which appears in many examples .",
    "since we are also interested in the case where the conditioning event is beyond the range of observations , a semiparametric procedure is defined to allow this extrapolation .",
    "this again necessitates restrictive assumptions .",
    "those we make are satisfied by several models already investigated ( cf .",
    "let us finally note that to the best of our knowledge , the estimators of the quantities related to the conditional laws presented in this paper have not been considered before .",

    "a functional central limit theorem for the estimator of the limiting distribution is obtained under a second order condition . in section  [ sec : product ] , a specific analysis of the case of a limiting distribution with product form and @xmath3 in the domain of attraction of the gumbel law is done .",
