    "both are mps with bond dimension 2 and are uniform superpositions of a linear number of computational - basis states . for both states ,",
    "the expectation value of a pauli operator @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 is @xmath165 for the w state and @xmath166 for @xmath161 , and the sum runs over computational states that appear in the decomposition of the state .",
    "for all @xmath167 , there exists a pauli operator @xmath168 such that @xmath169 .",
    "since the pauli operators form a group , @xmath170 is another pauli operator and all terms appearing in the sums are @xmath171 .",

    "define the set of negligible expectation values as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a positive number to be determined .",
    "we split the fidelity into a significant and a negligible contribution @xmath176 and bound the negligible contribution using @xmath177 the sum of a subset of @xmath178 is bounded by the sum over _ all _ @xmath178 . to bound @xmath179",

    "in particular , for qubits , the maximum number of measurements is @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , since the number of measurement settings does not scale with the size of the system , the total number of measurements scales as @xmath192 which is at least a _ quadratic improvement over the number of measurements needed to perform brute - force tomography _ on a generic state of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the monte carlo method proposed here can be adapted to continuous variable systems , such as a single electromagnetic field mode in a cavity @xcite , by modifying how the state is parameterized and how the sampling is performed .",
    "the main reason for this is the obvious difficulty of measuring observables in a discrete infinite dimensional operator basis .",
    "this problem can be avoided by considering phase - space quasiprobability distribution descriptions of quantum states .",
    "if we consider the dual phase - space distributions @xmath193 and @xmath194 which correspond respectively to the quantum state @xmath2 and an observable @xmath14  @xcite , then @xmath195 it follows that the fidelity between a pure state @xmath2 and an arbitrary state @xmath1 is given by @xmath196 which can be re - written as @xmath197 where the integration excludes regions with @xmath198 and where @xmath199 is the _ relevance density function_. sampling the relevance density can be done by standard methods , such as rejection sampling .",
    "the choice of phase space distributions is important , as it must be possible to interpret @xmath200 as probability distributions , and it must be possible to estimate @xmath201 at some arbitrary @xmath202 easily from experimental data .",
    "one choice that fulfills both these requirements for all states is the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is self - dual and bounded in magnitude by @xmath203 , and its value at particular @xmath175 can be estimated by using simple experiments where the continuous variable system , such as an electromagnetic field mode , interacts with an atom  @xcite .    the same truncation technique used to evaluate the performance of this algorithm for qubits can be used for continuous variable systems .",
    "amplification of experimental uncertainty can once again by reduced by placing a cut - off in the relevance density function .",
    "if we disregard regions in phase space where the absolute value of the relevance density is below @xmath77 , then the error @xmath204 in the fidelity is bounded by @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the region in phase space where @xmath207 .",
    "sampling from the relevance distribution @xmath22 is not trivial because the dimension of the operator space on @xmath0 particles is exponentially large in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , computing all @xmath187 for all observables @xmath186 is unefficient .",

    "<S> our scheme offers four significant advantages for the characterization of quantum states ( equivalent statements hold for quantum operations ) : _ ( 1 ) _ its computational cost is bounded by @xmath4 , compared to @xmath5 required for the simplest tomography procedure based on pseudo - inverses . _ </S>",

    "<S> the fidelity with accuracy @xmath34 therefore requires repeating the measurement of @xmath35 roughly @xmath36 times , which in the worst case grows exponentially with the number of qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> these are important limitations , and as a consequence our method will not scale polynomially for all quantum states and operations , but nevertheless always does significantly better than tomography . in addition , there are important classes of states and operations which avoid these two problems ( see table  [ tab : certificationtable ] and the supplemental material for complete details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ continuous variables systems _ for infinite dimensional systems , such as a harmonic oscillator or a single optical mode in a cavity , it is more convenient to describe a state @xmath37 by its wigner functions @xmath38  @xcite ( other indicator functions could also be used ) . equation   becomes @xmath39 where the relevance density @xmath40 is defined as the square of the wigner function of the theoretical state , whose purity guarantees once again that @xmath41 is well defined as a probability density . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function of the experimental state @xmath1 can be measured by interactions with an atom and measurements of the atom s state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> points in the complex plane can be selected according to @xmath41 using simple methods such as rejection sampling . as an example </S>",

    "<S> it can be shown that @xmath53  @xcite , reducing the problem of comparing two processes @xmath50 and @xmath54 to the problem of comparing two states @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is solved by the monte carlo state certification presented above .    </S>",
    "<S> while this derivation makes use of the maximally entangled state @xmath57 , the experimental realization of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states . </S>",
    "<S> a direct implementation of the quantum monte carlo state certification would prepare a maximally entangled state @xmath57 , apply @xmath58 to half of the system , and then measure random pauli operators on all qubits . a more practical approach </S>",
    "<S> consists of preparing the complex conjugate of random product of eigenstates of local pauli operators ( corresponding to the resulting state after half of the entangled state is measured destructively ) , applying the transformation @xmath58 to the system , and finally measuring a random pauli operator on each qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this simplification , based on the identity @xmath59 , generates the same statistics as the direct scheme  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> both these approaches rely heavily on the preparation of stabilizer states  @xcite and the application of quantum operations known as the clifford group  @xcite , which map stabilizer states to stabilizer states . </S>",
    "<S> stabilizer states are also important for quantum computation in general because of their close relationship to a large class of quantum error correction codes known as _ stabilizer codes_. many of the experimental demonstrations of state preparation to date have been of stabilizer states , such as states encoded into stabilizer codes  @xcite , cluster states  @xcite , and the ghz state @xmath60  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first describe how to _ certify _ these states and operations . </S>",

    "<S> it follows that @xmath65 if either of @xmath66 is in the stabilizer group and @xmath67 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> sampling from @xmath22 thus amounts to generating an index @xmath18 uniformly between 1 and @xmath13 , avoiding the problem associated with caveat * c1*. for the same reasons , @xmath68 for all @xmath18 with @xmath69 , so that the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath70 is not amplified , avoiding the problem associated with caveat * c2*. it also follows that the fidelity @xmath71 to a stabilizer state @xmath2 can be estimated with error @xmath34 using @xmath72 experiments involving only local projective measurements , _ independently of the system size and without any prior knowledge of the experimental state @xmath1_. since this result relies only on local measurements , it can immediately be generalized to states which are locally equivalent to stabilizer states .    </S>",
    "<S> this result carries over directly to the certification of clifford operation because their choi - jamiokowski density operators are stabilizer states . in the case of clifford transformations similar results </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained using `` twirling '' experiments  @xcite or by the selective measurement of matrix elements of the choi matrix  @xcite , although the monte carlo approach described here generalizes to other cases .    </S>",
    "<S> while operations in the clifford group are not sufficient to perform universal computation  @xcite , single qubit rotations can be used to reach universality , and these can be certified efficiently thanks to local equivalence of either operations ( if the rotation is applied directly ) or state preparation ( if the rotation is applied via `` magic state '' teleportation  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> stabilizer states can also be _ learned _ efficiently , as pointed out by aaronson and gottesman  @xcite , although the known method for efficient stabilizer learning requires entangling measurements . aside from the direct generalizatin of the stabilizer approach , </S>",
    "<S> clifford group operations can be learned efficiently  @xcite if one has access to bell measurements and the inverse of the operation being learned . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of performing these tasks efficiently with strictly local measurements and without the need for the inverse remains open .    </S>",
