    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) are characterized by a novel topological order @xcite which dictates the appearance of spin - filtered massless dirac fermions on the surface.@xcite to experimentally address the peculiar physics of 3d tis , it is desirable to access the dirac point of the surface state ( ss).@xcite this is relatively easy with the surface - sensitive spectroscopies such as the angle - resolved photoemission @xcite and the scanning tunneling microscope,@xcite but it is more challenging for the bulk - sensitive transport experiments because the chemical potential is always pinned to the bulk bands ( including the impurity band ) in real materials . to tune the chemical potential to a desirable position for transport experiments ,",
    "two approaches have been employed : one is the tuning of the chemical compositions upon synthesizing crystals,@xcite and the other is the gating to control the surface carriers.@xcite among the latter approach , the electric - double - layer gating ( edlg ) method is a promising new technique @xcite to allow application of a large electric field.@xcite    in the edlg configuration , either cations or anions in a liquid electrolyte are accumulated near the surface of a sample by application of an electric field , and they form an electric double layer which generates a very strong electric field locally on the surface .",
    "this leads to the induced surface carrier density of as high as @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3.@xcite such a large tunability of the surface carrier density is the merit of the edlg method . in the context of tis , yuan _ et al .",
    "_ showed @xcite that the edlg method allows an ambipolar doping control in ultrathin films of bi@xmath0te@xmath4 ; however , the surface state was obviously gapped in the ultrathin films used in ref . , and consequently the transport properties were likely to be dominated by the bulk state .",
    "in the present paper , we show that the edlg method can achieve ambipolar transport even in bulk single crystals , if one uses the highly bulk - insulating bi@xmath5sb@xmath6te@xmath7se@xmath8 ( bsts ) system.@xcite in our experiment , the control of the chemical potential was possible on the _ whole surface of a bulk 3d sample _ , opening new experimental opportunities for tis .",
    "in addition , our data suggest that the chemical potential is moving not only at the surface but also in the bulk , possibly due to a nearly reversible electrochemical reaction to cause apparent bulk doping during the edlg process .",
    "a series of bsts single crystals were grown by a modified bridgman method.@xcite six gold wires were attached to each sample by a spot welding technique , and magnetotransport measurements were performed by a conventional ac six - probe method by sweeping the magnetic field between @xmath99 t. an electrically insulating cup made of stycast 1266 was used as a sample container , in which the sample with gold wires was submerged into an ionic liquid ( il ) electrolyte , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "we used a specially purified ionic liquid [ etmeim][bf@xmath10 as the electrolyte.@xcite as the gate electrode , an additional piece of gold wire was dipped into the il without touching the sample . in this paper , we adopt the convention of defining the gate voltage by taking the sample as the reference point , as was done in most of the previous works . in this convention ,",
    "@xmath11-type carriers are supposed to be doped to the surface when a positive gate voltage is applied .",
    "the gate voltage was applied in the following procedure : first , the temperature @xmath12 of the sample was stabilized at 220 k ; then , the gate voltage @xmath13 was swept slowly , and the temperature was kept at 220 k for at least 10 min after the voltage reached the set value ; finally , the sample was cooled down slowly . when changing the gate voltage , we cycled the above procedure",
    ". figures 1(b)-1(e ) show an example of the history of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , gate current @xmath14 , and the accumulated charge , during the procedure for the target @xmath13 of @xmath15 v. with the il used in the present experiment , gate current was never detected at temperatures below 200 k , even when the gate voltage was changed .",
    "this is because when the il solidifies , ions are not mobile at all .",
    "the accumulated ions can be released when the gate voltage is set to zero and the system is warmed up to 220 k. such a relaxation process from @xmath13 = @xmath15 v is shown in figs .",
    "1(f)-1(h ) .",
    "one can see that the amount of released charge [",
    "@xmath132 @xmath16c in fig .",
    "1(h ) ] is comparable to that of the accumulated charge [",
    "@xmath134 @xmath16c in fig .",
    "the small difference between the released and accumulated charge is probably an indication of an irreversible electrochemical reaction during the gating processes at a high gate voltage . in the above example ,",
    "the total surface area of the sample was 13.4 mm@xmath17 , so that the @xmath132 @xmath16c of charge accumulated on the surface corresponds to the accumulated ion density of @xmath11.6@xmath18 @xmath3 and the capacitance of the unit area 80 @xmath16f @xmath3 , which is comparable to that previously reported for edlg.@xcite figure 1(i ) shows @xmath13 vs @xmath14 curve at 220 k , which indicates that there is a threshold @xmath19 of @xmath12 v below which little current flows , suggesting that the ions are not mobile below this threshold voltage ; similar behavior was previously reported for a different il.@xcite the origin of this behavior is currently not clear , but it may well be a characteristic of the ionic liquid used here . also , it was difficult to obtain reproducible results of the transport properties for @xmath19 between 2 and 3 v , probably because the formation of the electric double layer is unstable in this gate - voltage region . therefore , we closely measured the transport properties only in the range of @xmath20 v and @xmath13 = 0 v.",

    "@xcite figure 2(a ) shows the temperature dependences of the resistivity @xmath45 with the gate voltage ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath15 , 0 , and + 3.5 v. even though this is a bulk single crystal , at low temperatures @xmath45 presents a clear change upon application of @xmath13 ; namely , below @xmath150 k , @xmath45 changes with changing @xmath13 , and it tends to decrease ( increase ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath13 .",
    "figure 2(b ) magnifies this change for @xmath46 20 k. figure 2(c ) shows the magnetic - field dependences of the hall resistivity , @xmath27 .",
    "the sign of the charge carriers remains negative in this sample , although a significant non - linearity suggests the coexistence of surface and bulk conduction channels .",
    "note that the surface conduction in tis can involve both the topological surface states and topologically - trivial two - dimensional electron - gas ( 2deg ) states that appear as a result of band bending .",
    "@xcite in the present experiment , when the gate voltage is applied , the 2deg states are most likely contributing to the conduction alongside of the topological surface states .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to elucidate the contributions of the topological and non - topological surface states because no shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillation has been observed in our gated samples .",
    "( to successfully separate the contributions of the two , detailed information obtained from sdh oscillations is necessary.@xcite ) we therefore make no claim of the composition of the surface carriers in the present paper .    in fig .",
    "2(c ) , one can see a clear tendency that both the absolute value of @xmath26 and the slope of @xmath27 decrease upon increasing @xmath13 from @xmath15 to + 3.5 v ; this means that the apparent electron concentration increases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath11-type carriers are expected to be doped when a positive @xmath13 is applied , the present observation can be understood as a natural consequence of the edlg .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath47-dependence observed in @xmath26 is useful for gaining insights into the respective roles of bulk and surface transport channels , because its analysis based on a simple two - band model @xcite gives a crude idea about the relevant transport parameters .",
    "for example , the @xmath27 data at @xmath13 = 0 v give the following estimate based on the fitting shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) : for the bulk channel , the bulk resistivity @xmath48 3 @xmath49 , the bulk carrier density @xmath50 9 @xmath31 10@xmath32 @xmath33 , and the bulk mobility @xmath51 30 cm@xmath17/v@xmath36s ; for the surface channel , the sheet resistance @xmath52 8 @xmath38 , the surface carrier density @xmath53 2 @xmath31 10@xmath40 @xmath41 , and the surface mobility @xmath54 5 @xmath31 10@xmath43 cm@xmath17/v@xmath36s . in this",
    "fitting , the constraint imposed by the presence of sharp kinks at @xmath551 t helps reduce the ambiguity in the fitting parameters , and in fact , the three parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath56 , and @xmath39 , are in reasonable agreement with our previous transport studies of bsts involving sdh oscillations.@xcite the large value of @xmath42 would imply that the sdh oscillations be observed , but we did not observe any sdh oscillations in this sample ; this is possibly because the surface chemical potential ( and hence @xmath39 ) is not very uniform throughout the sample and the sdh oscillations with various different frequencies add up to smear visible oscillations .",
    "the above result of the two - band analysis suggests that the surface contribution in the total conductance was only @xmath11% , which is reasonable because the measured sample had a considerable thickness of 332 @xmath16 m . nevertheless , if one looks at the edlg effect in resistivity [ figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] , one notices a very puzzling fact : for the negative @xmath13 of @xmath15 v , the number of surface electrons are expected to be reduced and indeed , the slope of @xmath26 gets larger ; however , the resistivity increase is as much as 25% .",
    "since the surface contribution in the total conductance is only @xmath11% , even when the surface conduction is completely suppressed by edlg , one can expect an increase in @xmath45 of @xmath11% at most , as long as the bulk channel is not affected by edlg .",
    "therefore , the observed large increase in @xmath45 strongly suggests that the bulk channel must also be affected by edlg .",
    "indeed , the @xmath27 data shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) presents a clear change in the slope at high fields for different @xmath13 , which implies that not only @xmath39 but also @xmath30 is changing . to corroborate this inference , the two - band analyses of the @xmath27 data at finite",
    "@xmath13 suggests that the bulk carriers decreases ( increases ) by 5% ( 10% ) for @xmath13 of @xmath15 v ( @xmath57 v ) .",
    "it is very surprising that the edlg affects the density of bulk carriers by a noticeable amount in a sample as thick as 332 @xmath16 m , but our transport data can hardly be understood if one does not accept this possibility . given that the electric field generated by @xmath11 @xmath31 10@xmath2 @xmath3 of ions on the surface is shielded in less than 100 nm,@xcite the only possibility is that some bulk doping into the bsts sample is taking place during the edlg process . in this respect , the slow time scale of the change in the measured current during the edlg process seems to support the idea that some electrochemical reaction is taking place .",
    "in passing , we note that we have not successfully measured sdh oscillations in any of the gated samples .",
    "this is likely to be due to an inhomogeneous distribution of the local electric field ( which is conceivable because our samples have a lot of macroscopic terraces on the surface ) or some chemical degradation of the surface caused by the ionic - liquid gating .",
    "hence a more definitive analysis of the transport data beyond the simple two - band analysis is currently unavailable .",
    "nevertheless , the bulk doping due to the edlg seems to be an inevitable conclusion of our result .",
    "it was recently found @xcite that the position of the chemical potential with respect to the dirac point of the ss is tunable within the bulk band gap in bsts when one follows a particular series of @xmath59 and @xmath60 that were identified in ref . .",
    "in particular , the chemical potential was found to be close to both the dirac point of the ss and the middle of the bulk band gap in bisbtese@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , for our edlg experiment , to maximize the possibility of achieving ambipolar transport , we mainly measured the bisbtese@xmath0 system .",
    "( the gating data shown in fig . 1 were taken during the experiment on the bisbtese@xmath0 sample reported below . )     in the bisbtese@xmath61 single crystal used for the edlg experiment at @xmath13 = 0 v in a semi - log plot ; inset shows the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath45 at 1.8 k , where the arrows indicate the order of experiments .",
    "( b),(c ) low - temperature part of @xmath62 for various @xmath13.,width=321 ]    .experimental order of applied @xmath13 and resultant transport properties at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath63 is the low field limit of the hall coefficient . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     looking at the results of the two - band analyses of the data at finite @xmath13 , one can see that the hall data strongly suggests that both the bulk and surface carriers change sign simultaneously at @xmath64 v. indeed , we found that it is impossible to fit the @xmath26 data for @xmath64 v by assuming that only one of the two channels changes sign .",
    "therefore , it appears that in the present edlg experiment the chemical potential is swung from the @xmath11-type regime to the @xmath65-type regime not only on the surface but also in the bulk .",
    "most likely , what is happening in the bulk at negative @xmath13 is compensation due to electrochemical @xmath65-type doping , which eventually overwhelms the preexisting @xmath11-type bulk carriers .     at 1.7 k.,width=245 ]    finally , we show in fig .",
    "6 the magnetoresistance ( mr ) data for various @xmath13 values .",
    "obviously , the data present the weak antilocalization ( wal ) effect at low fields;@xcite since the wal effect is a signature of two - dimensional transport and is not usually observed in bulk ti crystals dominated three - dimensional transport , the mr data give additional evidence for a sizable contribution of the surface transport to the total conductance . at the same time , this wal effect makes it difficult to examine the consistency of the parameters obtained from the two - band analysis of @xmath27 in the mr data .",
    "also , the behavior of mr qualitatively changed after the application of @xmath13 = @xmath66 v , the origin of which is not clear at the moment . since the mr is too complicated and not very reproducible , we did not try to make a detailed analysis .",
    "it is important to mention that there are missing charges in our edlg experiment ; namely , the total amount of charge induced by gating in the sample is much smaller than the total amount of ions accumulated on the surface .",
    "for example , in the case of bisbtese@xmath0 , the total amount of accumulated charges measured by the current is @xmath134 @xmath16c , which corresponds to the ion density on the surface of @xmath11.6 @xmath31 10@xmath2 @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in the surface carrier density in bisbtese@xmath0 was @xmath14 @xmath31 10@xmath67 @xmath3 and its bulk carrier density changed by less than 1 @xmath31 10@xmath68 @xmath33 , which amounts to the total charge of less than 20 @xmath16c .",
    "therefore , obviously the gating is not very efficiently performed . in this regard ,",
    "the doping control of the surface carriers in the present experiment is similar to another edlg experiment on bi@xmath0te@xmath4 thin film,@xcite where @xmath17 @xmath31 10@xmath67 @xmath3 of surface carriers were doped with @xmath69 @xmath70 v. for other materials , the amount of surface carrier doping by edlg is of the order of 10@xmath7110@xmath2 @xmath3 , @xcite and thus the electric - field effect on bi - based topological insulators appears to be exceptionally ineffective.@xcite    the mechanism to cause these missing charges is not clear at the moment , but we speculate that some electrochemical redox reaction involving adsorbed molecules on the surface causes a layer of immobile charges that shields some fraction of the electric field created by the ions , leading to a weakening of the electric field for inducing mobile carriers in the sample .    also , the bulk doping that accompanies the edlg in our bsts samples is surprising .",
    "remarkably , the data for bisbtese@xmath0 suggests that the bulk doping process is nearly reversible and it takes place in the time scale of the order of 10 min .",
    "the chemical mechanism of this bulk doping is not clear at the moment , but the possible cause might be intercalation of ions into the van - der - waals gap in the bsts crystal .",
    "obviously , there is a lot to understand about the electrochemistry accompanying the edlg on bi - based tetradymite ti materials .",
    "in conclusion , the electric - double - layer gating ( edlg ) using ionic liquid was applied to bulk single crystals of bsts to control the chemical potential , and ambipolar transport was observed in a sample of bisbtese@xmath0 as thick as 181 @xmath16 m .",
    "the gating was successfully applied to tune the chemical potential on the whole surface of a three - dimensional sample , and surprisingly , it appears that the edlg on bsts crystals is accompanied by a nearly reversible electrochemical reaction that caused bulk carrier doping .",
    "it turned out that the edlg is exceptionally inefficient for the bsts system , with the maximum change in the surface carrier density of @xmath14 @xmath31 10@xmath67 @xmath3 despite the ion density on the surface of @xmath11.6 @xmath31 10@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the key to the successful ambipolar carrier control in the present experiment was the use of bisbtese@xmath0 crystals in which the chemical potential is located close to the middle of the bulk band gap @xcite and the residual bulk carrier density was only @xmath11 @xmath31 10@xmath32 @xmath33 . in combination with a technique to open a gap on the surface,@xcite the present experiment paves the way for topological magnetoelectric - effect experiments @xcite that require the chemical - potential control on the whole surface of a bulk topological insulator , although the mechanism of the bulk doping associated with edlg needs to be understood before this technique is comfortably applied .",
