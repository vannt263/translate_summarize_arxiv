    "the study of the strong deflection gravitational lensing of light by compact objects has received great attention in recent years , motivated by considerable evidence of the presence of supermassive black holes at the galactic centers .",
    "the relevant astrophysical quantities , i.e. the positions , magnifications , and time delays of the relativistic images produced by black hole lenses , can be approximately obtained in an analytic way by using the strong deflection limit for spherically symmetric lenses @xcite .",
    "the method relies on a logarithmic expansion of the deflection angle for light rays passing close to the photon sphere .",
    "black hole lensing was also numerically studied @xcite .",
    "non - rotating black holes coming from alternative theories were considered as gravitational lenses as well @xcite .",
    "kerr black holes were analyzed as lenses by several researchers @xcite ; in particular , the strong deflection limit was extended to these objects @xcite .",
    "the shadows ( or apparent shapes ) of non - rotating black holes are circular , but rotating ones present a deformation caused by the spin @xcite .",
    "this topic has been recently considered by several authors @xcite , both in einstein gravity and in modified theories , since it is expected that direct observation of black holes will be possible in the near future @xcite . in that case , the analysis of the shadows will be a useful tool for obtaining properties of astrophysical black holes and comparing different gravitational theories . for a review of strong deflection lensing and its consequences",
