    "proximity effects in superconductor ( s ) ferromagnet ( f ) hybrid structures have been studied for some time already.@xcite recent realization of a @xmath0 state in metallic sfs junctions , @xcite has reinvigorated interest in further experimental and theoretical studies.@xcite nowadays , understanding of the coherent geometrical effects in ballistic heterojunctions is also becoming more important , @xcite due to the progress in nanofabrication technology and the improvement of experimental techniques.@xcite    the possibility of a @xmath0 state in superconductors coupled through a magnetically active material ( an insulating barrier containing paramagnetic impurities , or a ferromagnetic metal ) has been proposed long ago . @xcite in the @xmath0 state of an sfs structure , in contrast to the usual ( 0 ) state , the phase shift equal to @xmath0 across the junction in the ground state reverses the direction of the supercurrent flow,@xcite and drastically changes the density of states ( dos ) in f metal.@xcite following the theoretical prediction,@xcite an evidence for @xmath0 states in proximity - coupled s - f superlattices has been sought previously in the oscillations of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 as a function of the f - layers thickness.@xcite more recently , @xmath0 states have been observed in nonmagnetic junctions of high-@xmath2 superconductors@xcite and in out - of - equilibrium mesoscopic superconducting structures.@xcite    oscillations of the maximum josephson current @xmath3 and of the local dos , with thickness and strength of the f layer , are prominent features of sfs metallic junctions .",
    "these oscillations are related to the crossovers between 0 and @xmath0 states , the @xmath3 minima being located at the crossover points.@xcite nonmonotonic temperature variation of @xmath3 , also related to the transition from @xmath0 to 0 state , has been observed recently.@xcite this effect is studied theoretically for superconducting junctions with different barriers , such as magnetically active insulating interfaces,@xcite metallic fif layers ( including insulating inhomogeneity and nonuniform magnetization),@xcite and ferromagnetic - metal barriers with mesoscopic disorder.@xcite the temperature induced @xmath4 transition is attributed to the spin discrimination of andreev bound states in the case of finite transparency and strong ferromagnetic influence.@xcite    another characteristic feature is a strong contribution of higher harmonics to the current - phase relation @xmath5 in the vicinity of the crossover points , as has been shown for metallic sfs junctions in both clean and diffusive limits,@xcite for josephson junctions with magnetically active insulating interface,@xcite and for non - equilibrium supercurrent through mesoscopic ferromagnetic weak links.@xcite this implies that the energy of the junction in the vicinity of the crossover has two minima as a function of @xmath6 , at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the resulting coexistence of stable and metastable 0 and @xmath0 states in the crossover region can generate two flux jumps per one external flux quantum in squids.@xcite    the underlying microscopic mechanism is well understood .",
    "the andreev process , recognized as the mechanism of normal - to - supercurrent conversion , @xcite is modified at f - s interfaces due to the spin imbalance in the ferromagnet.@xcite as a result , the superconducting pair amplitude induced in f by the proximity to s is spatially modulated.@xcite the current - carrying andreev bound states are split and shifted in an oscillatory way under the influence of the ferromagnet.@xcite the crossovers between 0 and @xmath0 states and highly nonsinusoidal current - phase relation follow from the strong spin polarization of the andreev states.@xcite    several quantities characterizing the proximity effect , such as @xmath5 and local dos , have been studied in a number of theoretical works for different geometries of s - f structures , using the quasiclassical approach in both clean and diffusive limits.@xcite however , a theory of the phase - coherent electronic transport in mesoscopic structures should be based on the solutions of gorkov or bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "the coherence effects have been studied recently for double - barrier sinis junctions containing an interlayer of a clean nonmagnetic metal ( n ) with insulating interfaces ( i),@xcite and for fisif junctions.@xcite    in this paper , we study the simultaneous influence of two insulating barriers on the supercurrent flow in ballistic double - barrier sifis planar junctions . the influence of different band - widths in two metals ( the fermi wave vector mismatch ",

    "@xcite in a limiting case , our expression gives a generalization of the previous formulae for the josephson current,@xcite that includes the finite interfacial transparency in sinis junctions .",
    "strong geometrical oscillations of @xmath3 in the junctions with thin normal - metal interlayers and finite interfacial transparency are related to the contribution of quasiparticle transmission resonances.@xcite for thin layers of a strong ferromagnet , these oscillations are superimposed on the oscillations related to the crossovers between 0 and @xmath0 states .",
    "lower transparency and fwvm shift the crossover points and narrow the adjacent regions of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states with highly nonsinusoidal current - phase relation . in a junction with finite transparency , with or without fwvm , and with strong ferromagnetic influence , the temperature - induced transition between @xmath10 and @xmath0 states occurs if the junction is sufficiently close to the crossover at zero temperature . in that case , the transition region of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states is considerably large .",

    "the region of coexisting @xmath10 and @xmath0 states , @xmath163 , is two times narrower than that in the transparent junction , @xmath164 . with increase of temperature or decrease of transparency",
    "the contribution from the higher - order scattering processes becomes negligible , transition regions become narrower and @xmath5 approaches the ordinary sinusoidal dependence , @xmath165 , where @xmath166 correspond to 0 and @xmath0 junction , respectively .",
    "note that similar highly nonsinusoidal variation of @xmath5 also occurs in sf - fs josephson junctions with transparent geometrical constrictions.@xcite however , such a behavior is not stable against a disorder . in diffusive double - barrier sifis junctions @xmath5",
    "does not cross the @xmath6 axis in the interval between @xmath10 and @xmath0.@xcite    the temperature variation of @xmath3 is usually a monotonic decay with increasing temperature .",
    "however , depending on parameters of the junction , the transition between 0 and @xmath0 states can be induced by changing the temperature . in that case , @xmath3 manifests nonmonotonic dependence on temperature with a well - pronounced dip at the transition .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 for the sifis junctions with @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath120 , and three values of @xmath11 close to @xmath169 at zero temperature ( @xmath170 at @xmath171 ) .",
    "three characteristic @xmath172 curves are shown for @xmath173 ( 0 state ) , @xmath174 ( @xmath0 state ) , and @xmath175 ( the temperature increase induces a transition from 0 to @xmath0 state at @xmath176 ) .",
    "a considerably large transition region of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states , @xmath177 , is shown in fig .",
    "similar @xmath1 transitions occur at different temperatures in a very narrow region @xmath178 about the crossover @xmath179 at zero temperature .",
    "we emphasize that the temperature - induced transition takes place in the vicinity of any crossover point of the junctions with finite transparency , with or without fwvm , and with strong ferromagnetic influence .",
    "for example , the temperature - induced transitions occur in the vicinity of the crossover points in fig .",

    "these results are in agreement with the general conditions for the occurrence of the temperature induced @xmath1 transition , given in ref . @xcite .    for thick layers of a weak ferromagnet , @xmath180 ,",
    "oscillations of @xmath151 due to the exchange potential are shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) for a junction with transparent interfaces , @xmath119 , equal fermi energies , @xmath120 , and for two temperatures .",
    "the influence of interfacial resistance and of fwvm at low temperature is illustrated in fig .",

    "6(a ) , with shifted @xmath179 and significant lowering of amplitudes .",
    "however , regions of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states are considerably narrower in the resistive junctions .",
    "for example , at low temperature , @xmath148 , in a junction with transparent interfaces and without fwvm , the crossover from 0 to @xmath0 state occurs at @xmath183 ( first dip in solid curve , fig .",
    "6(a ) ) with coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states in the region @xmath184 , while in a junction with finite transparency and fwvm ( @xmath147 , @xmath159 ) , the corresponding crossover occurs at @xmath185 ( first dip in solid curve , fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , and the coexisting region , @xmath186 , is five times narrower . because of weak ferromagnetic influence the temperature - induced transition is not found for the parameters displayed in fig . 6 .",
    "we have derived an expression for the josephson current in planar ballistic sifis junctions , generalizing the furusaki - tsukada formula@xcite so that it includes interfacial non - transparency and ferromagnetism in the normal - metal interlayer .",
    "we used a non - self - consistent step function for the pair potential , but in the case of low transparency , fwvm , and/or thin interlayers , our results will not be altered significantly . in that case , the depletion of the pair potential in the superconductors is negligible .",
    "characteristic proximity effects at transparent fs interfaces have to be studied by a self - consistent numerical treatment.@xcite in order to obtain simpler expressions for the scattering amplitudes , we have neglected , except in exponentials , the small energy terms in the wave vectors , since their contribution is typically less than 0.1@xmath187 .",
    "these terms are not neglected , however , in the exponentials , so that we take into account the significant contribution from both resonant and bound states , represented by rapidly and slowly oscillating terms .",
    "the solutions obtained for the andreev and the normal reflection amplitudes provide a fully microscopic study of the coherent superconducting properties in ballistic double - barrier junctions with ferromagnetic , or nonmagnetic normal - metal interlayer .",
    "the resulting wave functions and the quasiparticle excitation energies can be used to compute all physically relevant quantities , e.g. the local dos and the superconducting pair amplitude.@xcite these applications of our results are left for future work .",
    "qualitatively , our results confirm previously obtained main features of the metallic sfs systems , and uncover new coherency effects in nanostructured ballistic junctions .",
    "the pronounced geometrical oscillations of the supercurrent occur in double - barrier sinis junctions with thin interlayers of a clean normal metal , due to the coherent contribution of the quasiparticle transmission resonances to the andreev bound states.@xcite the amplitudes of the supercurrent oscillations are significantly larger than those of the normal current in the corresponding ninin ballistic junction . for thin layer of a strong ferromagnet , we found that geometrical oscillations are superimposed on the oscillations induced by crossovers between 0 and @xmath0 states . for high interfacial transparency and/or thick interlayers ,",
    "coherency effects are less pronounced , in agreement with previous theoretical results .",
    "@xcite low interfacial transparency and fwvm affect the position of crossover points , and narrower the transition regions of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states .",
    "we have shown that the temperature induced transition occurs in ballistic sifis junctions with finite interfacial transparency and strong ferromagnetic influence , if the parameters of the junction are sufficiently close to the crossover at zero temperature .",
    "the characteristic nonmonotonic variation of the maximum josephson current with temperature agrees with previous experimental and theoretical results .",
    "@xcite however , in the ballistic junctions the transition region of coexisting 0 and @xmath0 states is considerably large .",
