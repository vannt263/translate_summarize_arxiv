    "recently there has been an interest in the relation between metrics and their _ _ polynomial curvature invariants__. one of the first class of metrics that was investigated in this regard was the class of metrics having all vanishing curvature invariants ( vsi spacetimes ) .",
    "the 4 dimensional case was considered in @xcite and it was proven that all vsi spacetimes were of kundt type and they had curvature tensors of aligned type iii or simpler . the higher - dimensional case was considered in @xcite and it was indicated that the same was the case : the vsi spacetimes are of kundt type and have aligned type iii curvature tensors .",
    "however , a thorn in the proof is the apparent lack of a proof of lemma 10 .    for the spacetimes having constant scalar invariants ( csi spacetimes ) the degenerate kundt again were of importance @xcite",
    "indeed , in 4 dimensions , all spacetimes having a degenerate curvature structure in the sense that the metric is not characterised by the curvature invariants , are the degenerate kundt spacetimes @xcite . in terms of the algebraic classification",
    ", all metrics not being characterised by its invariants are of aligned type ii to all orders .",
    "we are thus led to an important question .",
    "does any lorentzian metric in higher dimensions which is not characterised by its polynomial curvature invariants have curvature tensors of type ii to all orders ?",
    "moreover , are they aligned , i.e. , are they all of type ii in the same frame ? in this paper",
    "we will use invariant theory and explore this question .",
    "indeed , our result is that the answer to this question is yes : a metric not characterised by its invariants has curvature tensors of type ii , and they are all aligned .",
    "we will refer to this result as the _ alignment theorem_.    in order to prove this theorem we will take the ideas in @xcite one step further and use real invariant theory and group theory , combined with standard real analysis .",
    "this is a new approach to this problem , but it is highly successful ; indeed , some of the corollaries of this theorem is a proof of the algebraic vsi conjecture @xcite ( thereby also lemma 10 therein ) along with proofs of several conjectures in @xcite .",
    "an important tool in the classification of spacetimes in higher dimensions is the boost weight decomposition @xcite which we will review in brief .",
    "given a covariant tensor @xmath0 with respect to a null frame , @xmath1 , the effect of a boost @xmath2 , @xmath3 allows @xmath0 to be decomposed according to its boost weight components @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the boost weight @xmath6 components ( with respect to the abovementioned boost ) of @xmath0 .",
    "an algebraic classification of tensors @xmath0 has been developed @xcite which is based on the existence of certain normal forms of ( [ bwdecomp ] ) through successive application of null rotations and spin - boost . in the special case where @xmath0 is the weyl tensor in four dimensions",
    ", this classification reduces to the well - known petrov classification .",
    "however , the boost weight decomposition can be used in the classification of any tensor @xmath0 in arbitrary dimensions . as an application",
    ", a riemann tensor of type @xmath7 has the following decomposition @xmath8 in every null frame .",
    "a riemann tensor is algebraically special if there exists a frame in which certain boost weight components can be transformed to zero , these are summarized in table [ riemtypes ] .",
    "in general we can define the following algebraic special cases which we will be useful for us :    a tensor , @xmath0 , is of    * type ii if there exists a frame such that all the positive boost - weight components are zero , @xmath9 ; * type d if there exists a frame such that @xmath0 has only boost - weight 0 components , @xmath10 ; * type iii if there exists a frame such @xmath0 has only negative boost weights , @xmath11 .",
    "if the tensor is of neither of these cases the tensor is of type i / g , or more general @xcite .",
    "this implies that a tensor , @xmath0 , of type ii has only non - positive boost weight components : @xmath12 for two tensors , @xmath0 and @xmath13 , both of type ii , then these have , separately , the above boost - weight decomposition , however , they may be with respect to _ different frames _ : @xmath14 if the tensors are of type ii _ in the same frame _ , then we say that the tensors @xmath0 and @xmath13 are of _ aligned type ii_.    a useful discrete symmetry is the following ( orientation - reversing ) lorentz transformation : n , [ dsym]which interchanges the boost weights , @xmath15 .",
    "let us review some of the results from invariant theory , specifically from @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider a group @xmath7 acting on a vector space @xmath16 . in our case",
    "we will be consider a real @xmath7 and a real vector space @xmath16 . however , it is adventageous to review the complex case with a complex group @xmath17 acting on a complex vector space @xmath18 . then for a vector @xmath19 we can define the _ orbit _ of @xmath20 under the action of @xmath17 as follows : @xmath21    then ( @xcite , p555 - 6 ) :    if @xmath17 is a linearly reductive group acting on an affine variety @xmath18 , then the ring of invariants is finitely generated .",
    "moveover , the quotient @xmath22 parameterises the closed orbits of the @xmath17-action on @xmath18 and the invariants separate closed orbits .    here",
    "the term _ closed _ refers to _ topologically closed _ with respect to the standard vector space topology and henceforth , closed will mean topologically closed .",
    "this implies that given two distinct closed orbits @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then there is an invariant with value @xmath25 on @xmath23 and @xmath26 on @xmath24 .",
    "this enables us to define the set of orbits : c_=\\{_(x )   _ ( x ) } based on the above theorem we can thus say that the invariants separate elements of @xmath27 and hence we will say that an element of @xmath27 is _ characterised by its invariants_.    in our case we will consider the real case where we have the lorentz group , @xmath28 which is a real semisimple group . for real semisimple groups acting on a real vector space we do not have the same uniqueness result as for the complex case @xcite . however , by complexification , @xmath29^{\\mathbb{c}}=\\gc$ ] we have @xmath30^{\\mathbb{c}}=o(n,\\mathbb{c})$ ] , and by complexification of the real vectorspace @xmath16 we get @xmath31 .",
    "the complexification thus lends itself to the above theorem , and consequently we will define _ characterised by its invariants _ as follows . for a tensor , @xmath0 , a rotation of a frame naturally defines a group action on the _ components _ of the tensor .",
    "then :    consider a ( real ) tensor , @xmath32 , or a direct sum of tensors , then if the orbit of the components of @xmath0 under the complexified lorentz group @xmath33 is an element of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath34 , then we will say that @xmath0 is _ characterised by its invariants_.    as the invariants parameterise the set @xmath27 and since the group action defines an equivalence relation between elements in the same orbit this definition makes sense .",
    "let us similarly define the real orbits : @xmath35 how do these results translate to the real case ?",
    "the real orbit @xmath36 , is a real section of the complex orbit @xmath37 .",
    "however , there might be more than one such real section having the same complex orbit . using the results of @xcite , these real closed orbits are disjoint , moreover :",
    "@xmath36 is closed in @xmath16 @xmath38 @xmath37 is closed in @xmath18 .",
    "thus the question of whether @xmath0 is characterised by its invariants is equivalent to whether @xmath36 is closed in @xmath16 .",
    "thus we can define similarly : c=\\{(x)v   ( x ) } , hence , we have that @xmath0 is characterised by its invariants iff @xmath39",
    ".    however , as pointed out , there might be other closed real orbits @xmath40 having the same invariants as @xmath41 ( in line with the comments in @xcite ) .",
    "an example of this is the pair of metrics : s^2_1&= & -t^2+(x^2+y^2+z^2 ) , + s^2_2&= & ^2+(x^2+y^2-^2 ) , the curvature tensors of these metrics lie in separate orbits @xmath36 , but in the same complex orbit @xmath37 .    note that the action of a @xmath42 on the components of a tensor @xmath0 , @xmath43 , can be interpreted as expressing the components in a different frame . if we consider a @xmath44 , we can write , @xmath45 the adjoint map @xmath46 is an isomorphism of lie groups , implying that if @xmath47 is , for example , a boost , then so will @xmath48 be but with respect to a different frame .",
    "another useful view of the orbits @xmath49 is as a dynamical system . consider the one - parameter groups @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an element of the lie algebra of @xmath28 ; i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 is generated by @xmath51 and is in the connected component of @xmath28 .",
    "we can now view the orbit @xmath49 as a dynamical system with a flow generated by @xmath51 as follows .",
    "consider a @xmath54 .",
    "then we can define the flow @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 fulfills the linear differential equation : = x(y ) , y(0)=y_0 .",
    "[ dynsys]this differential equation , for each @xmath58 defines a flow on @xmath49 .",
    "the unique solutions to this equation are the one - parameter orbits @xmath56 .    as an example , if @xmath51 generates a boost , @xmath6 , then the decomposition @xmath59 is an _ eigenvector decomposition _ with respect to this boost .",
    "each eigenvector @xmath60 has with eigenvalue @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath61 ; hence , by integration @xmath62 .",
    "the boost weight decomposition is thus an eigenvalue decomposition with respect to the differential equation ( [ dynsys ] ) .",
    "these dynamical systems are useful for us because there always exists a flow such that it has the point on the boundary as a limit .",
    "in particular , we have the following result ( see , e.g. , @xcite , proposition 1.6 ) :    let @xmath63 and assume that @xmath49 is not closed .",
    "then there exists an @xmath52 and an @xmath64 such that @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , the orbit @xmath67 is closed .",
    "[ flowprop ]    indeed , this lie algebra element @xmath51 can be chosen among the elements conjugate to the null - rotations and boosts ( see later and @xcite ) .",
    "consider a set of tensors @xmath68 , @xmath69 . we will express these tensors in terms of a basis of orthonomal ( or null ) vectors @xmath70 for an @xmath71-dimensional lorentzian manifold .",
    "define the vector consisting of the components : @xmath72\\in \\mathbb{r}^m$ ] , for some appropriate @xmath73 .",
    "our main result is the following .",

    "then there exists a null - frame such that all tensors have , in the same frame , the boost weight decomposition : @xmath74 i.e. , all positive boost weight components are zero . in particular , this means that all the tensors @xmath68 are of type ii and are _",
    "the proof of this theorem goes as follows .",
    "the vector @xmath72\\in \\mathbb{r}^m$ ] can be considered to generate an orbit under the lorentz group @xmath28 ( which is semisimple ) .",

    "there exists a sequence @xmath83 which converges to @xmath82 .",
    "this implies further that there exists a sequence @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "first we will show that there is a subsequence @xmath86 of @xmath87 for which @xmath88 ( using the standard norm in the space of matrices ) .",

    "consequently , there is a compact set , @xmath89 , for which @xmath90 .",
    "however , since the group action : @xmath91 , given by @xmath92 is continuous , then the set @xmath93 must be compact .",
    "however , since this implies that @xmath94 this is a contradiction .",
    "we can therefore assume that @xmath95 by taking an appropriate subsequence .",

    "it thus seems that the existence of @xmath82 is the key to understand why such an aligned frame exists .",
    "indeed , we note that a @xmath82 on the boundary but not in the orbit is a very restrictive requirement . for example , consider the simple case where we have a sole vector @xmath214 .",
    "the case when the vector is not characterised by its invariants is when @xmath215 ; i.e. , the null - cone , and the only possible @xmath82 is the origin : @xmath216 .",

    "we note that the alignment theorem results in a cascade of corollaries , many of which prove previous conjectures .",

    "this result is thus a big improvement and it gives a clear - cut separation between the metrics that are characterised by their invariants , and those that are not .",
    "so far only a formal mathematical definition is given as to when a metric is characterised in terms of its invariants .",
    "more intutiviely , one can say that _ all the local information of the metric is contained in the polynomial invariants .",
    "_ if we define @xmath248 to be the set of all _ polynomial curvature invariants _",
    ", then this means that local information ( except possible some discrete transformations ) , for example , the existence of killing vectors are incorporated in the set of invariants , @xmath248 .",
    "let us consider the case of killing vectors for which we have the following result @xcite :    if a spacetime @xmath249 is characterised by its invariants ( weakly or strongly ) , then if there exists a vector field , @xmath250 , such that @xmath251 then there exists a set , @xmath252 , of killing vector fields such that at any point the vector field @xmath250 coinsides with a killing vector field @xmath253 .",
    "note that we are not saying that @xmath250 is a killing vector , only that it implies the existence of a killing vector @xmath254 .",
    "we also note that since tensors of type i / g , d , or o are all characterised by their invariants so this result applies to all metrics having curvature tensors of either of these types . for these spacetimes we can thus check the invariants to check existence of killing vectors",
    "note however , that if we are interested in killing vectors belonging to the _ isotropy group _ , then these are zero at that point so @xmath255 trivally . on the other hand",
    ", the isotropy would lead to a relation between the components of the curvature tensors implying certain _ syzygies _ to be fulfilled .",
    "these syzygies , which define certain relations between the invariants , where discussed in @xcite . in order to check for isotropies one thus need to systematically study all possible syzygies of the curvature tensors .",
    "these syzygies are closely related to the corresponding curvature operators of the space @xcite .",
    "all possible curvature operators must possess the corresponding syzygies before we would be able to conclude the existence of an isotropy .",
    "the alignment theorem has also significance for the classification of spacetimes .",
    "for example , it gives a criterion for when spacetimes can be classified using the polynomial invariants only .",
    "interestingly , the only cases where this is not the case is when all the curvature tensors are aligned and of type ii ( or simpler ) .",
    "if the curvature tensors do not fulfill the alignment theorem then the spacetime is classified using its polynomial invariants .",
    "this cleary has great significance for the equivalence principle .",
    "note also that the alignment theorem provides a more direct proof of the @xmath256-property @xcite by directly utilising the boost - weight decomposition .",
    "degenerate spacetimes are important in many ( higher dimensional ) theories , for example , topologically massive gravity @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , holonomy @xcite , and special solutions , like gyratons @xcite .",
    "evidently , the alignment theorem proves their special significance in terms of the invariants .",
    "indeed , the alignment theorem gives a clear - cut condition for which spacetimes are degenerate when it comes to their polynomial curvature invariants .",
    "the theorem is valid in any dimension and is also valid for any tensor .",
    "the alignment theorem thus has applications beyond relativity as any tensor not characterised by its invariants in an lorentz - signature background would be subject to the alignment theorem .",
    "the proof of the theorem itself is based on simple real analysis ( in particular , convergent sequences ) and group theory ( through the iwasava decomposition ) .",
    "this sheds new light on the relation between the tensors and their polynomial invariants .",
    "indeed , these techniques are fairly general and are applicable to other signatures as well",
    ". this will be the subject of futher work .    although the alignment theorem enabled us to prove a series of previously unproven conjectures and problems there are still a few unanswered questions .",
    "for example , are all degenerate metrics kundt metrics @xcite ? clearly , without the alignment theorem , this would be a hard result to prove , indeed , in 4 dimensions this was proven in a case - to - case basis @xcite .",
    "however , in higher dimensions this question has been elusive but by using the alignment theorem this may now be tractable .",
    "i would like to thank robert milson whose comment on the alignment of tensors triggered me to explore this topic and write this paper .",
    "in addition , i would like to thank him and lode wylleman for comments on an earlier version of this paper .",
    "consider the case of a boost and a null - rotation , @xmath258 . in a block matrix representation",
    "we will write : y=            by computing the adjoint action of @xmath20 on @xmath259 : _",
    "x(y)=xyx^-1 , we note that we get another boost and null - rotation with respect to @xmath260 .",
