    "if @xmath0 is a locally compact group , then haar measure on @xmath0 leads to the convolution algebra @xmath6 , and we obtain a @xmath1-algebra @xmath7 as the enveloping @xmath1-algebra of @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath1-algebra has the universal property that each ( continuous ) unitary representation @xmath8 of @xmath0 on some hilbert space @xmath9 defines a unique non - degenerate representation of @xmath7 on @xmath9 and , conversely , each non - degenerate representation of @xmath7 arises from a unique unitary representation of @xmath0 .",
    "this correspondence is a central tool in the harmonic analysis on @xmath0 because the well - developed theory of @xmath1-algebras provides a powerful machinery to study the set of all irreducible representations of @xmath0 , to endow it with a natural topology and to understand how to decompose representations into irreducibles or factor representations .",
    "for infinite dimensional lie groups , i.e. , lie groups modeled on infinite dimensional locally convex spaces , there is no natural analog of the convolution algebra @xmath6 , so that we can not hope to find a @xmath1-algebra whose representations are in one - to - one correspondence to _ all _ unitary representations of @xmath0 .",
    "however , in @xcite h.  grundling introduces the notion of a _ host algebra _ of a topological group @xmath0 .",
    "this is a pair @xmath10 , consisting of a @xmath1-algebra @xmath11 and a morphism @xmath12 of @xmath0 into the unitary group of its multiplier algebra @xmath13 with the following property : for each non - degenerate representation @xmath14 of @xmath11 and its canonical extension @xmath15 to @xmath13 , the unitary representation @xmath16 of @xmath0 is continuous and determines @xmath14 uniquely . in this sense , @xmath11 is hosting a certain class of representations of @xmath0 . a host algebra @xmath17 is called _ full _ if it is hosting all continuous unitary representations of @xmath0 .",
    "now it is natural to ask to which extent infinite dimensional lie groups , or other non - locally compact groups , possess host algebras .",
    "one can not expect the existence of a full host algebra because , f.i .",
    ", the topological dual @xmath18 of an infinite dimensional locally convex space @xmath19 carries no natural locally compact topology .",
    "therefore one is looking for host algebras that accommodate certain classes of continuous unitary representations .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss a construction of host algebras based on holomorphic extensions of unitary representations of a lie group @xmath0 to certain complex semigroups @xmath3 .",
    "some of the basic ideas of our constructions appear already in @xcite , where one finds the construction of the enveloping @xmath1-algebras @xmath4 of a complex involutive semigroup @xmath3 , endowed with a locally bounded absolute value @xmath2 , and also in @xcite , where this is applied to the special case where @xmath3 is a complex banach  lie group . here",
    "we address the situation where @xmath3 may be an infinite dimensional semigroup which is not a group .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 1",
    "we first recall the concept of a complex involutive semigroup @xmath3 and associate to any locally bounded absolute value @xmath2 on @xmath3 a @xmath1-algebra @xmath4 with a holomorphic morphism @xmath20 having a suitable universal property . since our goal is to construct host algebras for infinite dimensional lie groups , we build in section 2 a bridge between complex involutive semigroups and lie groups by defining the notion of a host semigroup of a lie group . roughly speaking , this a complex involutive semigroup @xmath3 on which the lie group @xmath0 acts smoothly by unitary multipliers and for which there exists an open convex cone @xmath21 in the lie algebra @xmath22 of @xmath0 , invariant under the adjoint action , for which all @xmath23-actions on @xmath3 defined by the one - parameter semigroups @xmath24 , @xmath25 , extend to `` holomorphic '' one - parameter semigroups @xmath26 mapping the open upper halfplane @xmath27 holomorphically into @xmath28 .",
    "the main result of section 2 is that for each locally bounded absolute value @xmath2 on a host semigroup @xmath3 , the @xmath1-algebra @xmath4 is a host algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "this leaves us with the problem to understand the classes of representations of @xmath0 hosted by such @xmath1-algebras . to clarify this point",
    ", we consider in section 3 multiplier actions @xmath29 of a lie group @xmath0 on a @xmath1-algebra @xmath17 and study to which extent the action of certain one - parameter semigroups of @xmath0 extends holomorphically to the upper halfplane .",
    "this leads to the momentum map @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the set of all states @xmath32 of @xmath17 for which the canonical extension @xmath33 to @xmath34 yields a smooth function @xmath35 .",
    "the weak-@xmath5-closed hull @xmath36 of the image of @xmath37 is a convex set invariant under the coadjoint action , called the _ momentum set of @xmath38_. a crucial observation is that , if the multiplier action comes from a host algebra @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is a host semigroup , the convex cone @xmath39 has non - empty interior and the support function @xmath40 is locally bounded .",
    "this observation suggests that to find host algebras for @xmath0 , one should start with an @xmath41-invariant weak-@xmath5-closed convex subset @xmath42 for which the corresponding _ support function _",
    "@xmath43 is locally bounded . as the function @xmath44 is convex ,",
    "we take in section 4 a closer look at convex functions on open convex domains in locally convex spaces . in particular , we show that whenever @xmath22 is barrelled , the existence of interior points in the cone @xmath45 automatically implies that @xmath44 is locally bounded and even continuous .    in section 5",
    "we then show how this circle of ideas can be completed in the abelian case . here",
    "the lie group @xmath0 is a locally convex space @xmath46 and the semigroup is a tube @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is an open convex cone . in this case",
    "it suffices to consider absolute values of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a weak-@xmath5-closed convex subset .",
    "now @xmath2 is locally bounded if and only if the support function @xmath51 is locally bounded on @xmath21 .",
    "if this is the case , then the results of section 4 imply that @xmath52 is locally compact and @xmath53 is a host algebra of @xmath46 hosting precisely all unitary representations of @xmath46 arising from spectral measures on the locally compact subset @xmath54 .",
    "section 6 contains a brief discussion of the finite dimensional case , which is developed in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we give a short and direct proof of the fact that any host algebra of @xmath0 coming from a host semigroup is a quotient of the group @xmath1-algebra @xmath7 .",
    "the next steps of this project aim at a better understanding of the classes of representations of a lie group @xmath0 hosted by @xmath1-algebras of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the first major problem one has to solve here is to find a suitable complex involutive semigroup @xmath3 whenever the invariant convex set @xmath42 is given . for finite dimensional groups this",
    "has been carried out in @xcite , but for infinite dimensional groups many key tools are still missing .",
    "furthermore , once the semigroup @xmath3 is constructed , one has to find the class of unitary representations of @xmath0 extending to holomorphic representations of @xmath3 .",
    "we leave all that to the future .      for the sake of easier reference , we collect some of the basic definitions concerning infinite dimensional manifolds and lie groups .",

    "if @xmath63 exists for all @xmath64 .",
    "it is called _ continuously differentiable or @xmath65 _ if it is continuous and differentiable at all points of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a continuous map .",
