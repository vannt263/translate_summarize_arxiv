    "the one - dimensional trapping potential is realised on an atomchip  @xcite by a radially symmetric ioffe - pritchard field modified by radio - frequency dressing  @xcite , as explained in detail in ref .  @xcite . in the present experiment ,",
    "the ac current applied has a peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath41 with detuning @xmath42 with respect to the larmor frequency near the trap minimum ( @xmath43 ) .    in the @xmath7-direction , where the displacement occurs , the potential is well approximated by the 6th - order polynomial @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and where @xmath48 is the oscillator length in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the energy differences between the first three single - particle levels of the potential are @xmath5 and @xmath49 . in the other directions ,",
    "the confinement remains essentially harmonic with @xmath50 .    in the @xmath51-direction",
    ", it can be described by a quartic polynomial of the form @xmath52 , with the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the oscillator length in this direction .",
    "this gives a first level spacing @xmath56 .    to create motional states superpositions ,",
    "we displace the trap minimum along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "this displacement is achieved by modulating the radio - frequency currents with a low - frequency signal .",
    "the frequencies of this signal , on the order of a few kilohertz , are much lower than the larmor frequency of the atoms but higher than the limit for adiabatic displacement of the wavefunction in the transverse potential .",
    "this modulation displaces the potential minimum along @xmath7 , following a control trajectory calculated by oct .",
    "the atomic cloud is `` shaked '' by this fast potential displacement .",
    "the goal of optimal control is to find the best path in the control parameter space , which is expressed formally as a minimisation of a cost function or performance measure  @xcite .    for the optimisation",
    ", we describe the system as a condensate wavefunction using an effective one - dimensional gpe along the @xmath7-axis , with the hamiltonian @xmath57=-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}+v(y - \\lambda(t ) ) + g_\\text{y}(n ) n\\vert\\psi(y , t)\\vert^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath59 the atomic mass , @xmath60 the number of atoms and @xmath61 the effective one - dimensional interaction constant in the @xmath7-direction  @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the potential @xmath62 can be spatially displaced along @xmath7 by a distance @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1](a ) ) .",
    "the crab optimisation method expands the control pulse into a ( not necessarily orthogonal ) basis . here",
    ", the optimisation is carried on 60 fourier components with their respective amplitudes and phases . under the action of the control pulse ,",
    "the wavefunction undergoes a transformation that is computed numerically using split - step analysis  @xcite .",
    "the wavefunctions of the different motional states are the stationary solutions of the gpe and were obtained numerically by imaginary time propagation  @xcite .",
    "because the effect of interactions in the @xmath7-direction is already negligible after a very short time - of - flight ( less than @xmath63 ) , we assume a ballistic expansion . the density distribution imaged after time - of - flight is then homotetic to the momentum distribution .    to simulate this distribution",
    ", we calculate the evolution of the 1d gpe in the static potential @xmath64 starting from a given initial superpositon of @xmath65 states @xmath66 where @xmath67 , corresponding to the three lowest - lying states in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "we compute the momentum distribution and compare its evolution to the experimental densities after time - of - flight .    to recover the wavefunction superposition after the control pulse from experimental data , we fit the data with a time - dependent momentum density along @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical momentum density is obtained by fourier transform of an in - trap gpe simulation .",
    "experimentally , we can access the atomic density after @xmath11 time - of - flight .",
    "the fast transverse expansion of the cloud due to high confinement causes the atomic interactions to become rapidly negligible , hence the expansion can be considered ballistic . in the limit of infinite expansion time ,",
    "the in - trap momentum distribution and the density after time of flight are strictly equivalent . here",
    ", the time of flight is sufficiently long to make this assumption .",
    "if we express the momenta as wave numbers @xmath68 , a distance @xmath69 in the experimental image then corresponds to @xmath70 with @xmath71 . the simulated momentum distribution is slightly rescaled on the @xmath65-axis and corrected for imaging broadening , then sampled to match the experimental sampling time @xmath72 .",
    "we simulate the momentum distribution density with , as fit parameters , the atomic fractions in the first three motional states @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath73 , as well as the relative phases between those states @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we chose to restrict the model to a three states superposition here .",
    "first , multi - mode simulations show that the main features of the experimental data can be reproduced by a 3-mode description similar to ref .",
    "second , this assumption is justified by the fact that adding more states does not improve nor modify much the output of the fit .",
    "from there , the similarity between simulated and experimental densities is evaluated by substracting both and calculate the residual . to obtain the combination of parameters most likely to have generated the observed momentum distribution density , we use a simplex regression method that searches the smallest possible residual and gives their corresponding best values for the fit parameters . once these parameters are obtained , we look for the uncertainty of the fit by estimating the variances and co - variances of the different parameters and deduce the confidence intervals of the fit .",
    "we note that these fits are based on gross - pitaevskii simulations , which represent a unitary evolution for a mean - field description of a system at zero temperature .",
    "although this model describes the main features of our data very well , some discrepancy between the model and the experiment ( e.g. many - body or finite temperature effects ) may have systematic effects on the estimation of the fidelity .",
    "it is nevertheless unlikely that these discrepancies have a qualitative effect on the interferometer output .",
    "we estimated the rate of many - body dephasing that could arise from number fluctuations in the ground and excited states .",
    "we followed the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , and , assuming weak interaction , approximated the field operator @xmath76 describing the bec by : @xmath77 here the @xmath78 s are the two lower - lying eigenstates of the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian ( taken to be real and normalized to @xmath79 ) , the @xmath80 s are annihilation operators associated with the modes and a 1d geometry along the @xmath7-axis was assumed for simplicity . from the full many - body hamiltonian describing the condensate and equation  , we obtain the following effective 2-mode hamiltonian :        where we used the usual spin representation for the many - body two level system by introducing the operators @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which satisfy angular momentum commutation relations .",
    "this hamiltonian resembles the bosonic josephson hamiltonian in the presence of an energy offset between the two modes , here given by the difference of chemical potential between the ground and first excited states ( first term @xmath86 ) .",
    "the second term @xmath87 , which comes from interactions , is responsible for `` phase diffusion '' ( dephasing ) .",
    "it leads to squeezing at short times  @xcite , generation of strongly non - classical states  @xcite and a loss of coherence at longer times  @xcite .",
    "the third term is generally not present in bosonic josephson junctions .    in the second term of equation",
    ", it is apparent that phase diffusion is reduced compared to e.g.  the case of a double well system  @xcite , as the modes have a significant spatial overlap .",
    "this is similar to the case of a spinor condensate in which two spin states share the same external wavefunction and have similar scattering lengths  @xcite .",
    "we can evaluate the phase diffusion rate if we assume e.g.  a binomial distribution of the atoms in each mode ( i.e.  @xmath88 ) , which is a fair assumption if the first @xmath13 pulse is performed quickly compared to the other energy scales ( in particular compared to interactions that may induce squeezing ) .",
    "it is then given by  @xcite :      we computed the two wavefunctions @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the trapping potential @xmath92 and obtained the energies @xmath93hz , @xmath94hz , and @xmath95hz .",
    "this yields @xmath96hz , and a phase diffusion rate @xmath97mrad / ms .",
    "this rate increases with atom number fluctuations and can become significant if the fluctuations are much stronger than in the binomial case ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the population difference between the modes ) .",
    "this could be the case , as both modes overlap ."

    "<S> we evaluated the rate of dephasing  @xcite between the two modes arising from interactions and binomial number fluctuations in each mode and found @xmath38 , hence a dephasing of @xmath39 only after @xmath40 , which is too long to account for the observed decay ( see supplementary information for detail ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) collisional decay of the quantum gas trapped in the excited states would lead to emission of momentum - correlated atom pairs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not observe such pair creation in the present experiment , likely due to the lower population in @xmath14 and the shorter observation times compared to  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the observed decay is intrinsically related to the specific superposition created by the first pulse of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> this superposition is a highly excited non - stationary state characterised by non - trivial collective oscillations and may be subjected to damping via scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> ramsey interferometry using motional states introduces a new tool to study out - of - equilibrium evolution of coherent systems at the quantum level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may help to shed light onto the mechanisms responsible for the loss of coherence in many - body systems , in particular show the role of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , fast and coherent manipulation of motional states in a many - body quantum system offers many possibilities that go far beyond ramsey interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> it permits the implementation of general gate operations , the encoding of information into motional states  @xcite , and more generally opens up new perspectives for the use of many - body systems as a viable element in quantum technological applications . </S>"
