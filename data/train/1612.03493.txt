    "the belle experiment successfully operated for more than a decade until 2010 at the asymmetric - energy @xmath4 collider kekb  @xcite .",
    "the experiment took data at center - of - mass energies corresponding to several @xmath5s ) resonances ; the total data sample recorded exceeds  @xmath6 . here",
    "we present recent results based on the full data sample .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath7 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the decay @xmath9 proceeds through electroweak and gluonic @xmath10 penguin annihilation processes .",
    "these amplitudes are proportional to the small cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  @xcite matrix element @xmath11 and thus are highly suppressed .",
    "the branching fraction has been estimated based on naive qcd factorization  @xcite and perturbative qcd  @xcite and found to be in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "however , the internal loop can also be mediated by non - sm particles such as a charged higgs boson or supersymmetric squarks , and thus the decay is sensitive to new physics ( np ) .",
    "it is estimated that such np could enhance the branching fraction to the level of @xmath14 to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "previously , no evidence for this decay has been found .",
    "here we describe a recent belle search for this decay with much higher sensitivity than previously that uses the full data set of 711  recorded on the @xmath16(4s ) resonance  @xcite .    candidate @xmath17 mesons are reconstructed via @xmath18 decays . the @xmath19 invariant mass is required to be in the range @xmath20 $ ]  gev/@xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath22 in resolution around the @xmath17 mass .",
    "candidate @xmath23 mesons are identified using a modified beam - energy - constrained mass @xmath24 , and the energy difference @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the beam energy and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momentum and energy , respectively , of the @xmath29 candidate .",
    "all quantities are evaluated in the center - of - mass frame . to improve the @xmath30 resolution ,",
    "the momentum @xmath27 is calculated as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the photon momentum , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the energy and momentum , respectively , of the @xmath17 candidate .",
    "we require that events satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the signal yield is calculated in a smaller `` signal region '' @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "charmless hadronic decays suffer from large backgrounds arising from continuum @xmath39 production . to suppress this background",
    ", we use a multivariate analyzer based on a neural network ( nn )  @xcite .",
    "the nn generates an output variable @xmath40 , which ranges from @xmath41 for background - like events to @xmath42 for signal - like events .",

    "the variable @xmath44 is well - described by a sum of gaussian functions . after the above selections , 961 events remain .",
    "the remaining background consists of continuum events and rare charmless @xmath48-decay processes .",
    "we obtain the signal yield using an unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit to the observables @xmath30 , @xmath49 , @xmath44 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the helicity angle @xmath51 is the angle between the @xmath52 momentum and the opposite of the @xmath23 flight direction in the @xmath17 rest frame .",
    "the resulting branching fraction is calculated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the signal yield in the signal region , @xmath55 is the number of @xmath56 events , @xmath57 is the signal efficiency as calculated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , and @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for this decay and set an upper limit on the branching fraction of @xmath59 at 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "this limit is almost an order of magnitude lower than the previous most stringent result  @xcite .",
    "the rare decay @xmath60 involves the quark transition @xmath61 , a flavor changing neutral current that is forbidden at tree level in the sm .",
    "higher order sm processes such as penguin or @xmath62 box diagrams allow for such transitions , leading to branching fractions below @xmath63 . various extensions to the sm predict np amplitudes that can interfere with the sm amplitudes and lead to enhanced or suppressed branching fractions and modified angular distributions .",
