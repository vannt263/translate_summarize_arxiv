    "the limit cycle follows for a time a repelling slow manifold .",
    "phenomena of this type are invariably studied in the time domain and in this paper we seek to extend the slow - fast decomposition to solutions that evolve in space forming , for example , a front separating two distinct states of the system .",
    "we also describe stability properties of such states in _ time _ , in other words , we are interested in canard - like phenomena in a partial differential equation ( pde ) context . amongst the few studies in this direction , we mention _ canard traveling waves _ , which have been analysed in a moving frame as homoclinic connections with a canard segment @xcite , shock - like structures in pdes which can also be interpreted in terms of canards  @xcite and canard - related bifurcation delay in reaction - diffusion pdes @xcite .",

    "@xmath15 infinitesimal spatially localized disturbances travel to the right more rapidly than they grow and at each fixed location the disturbance decays to zero as @xmath16 .",
    "thus , despite the instability of @xmath17 in an appropriately moving frame , the state @xmath17 is stable in this sense . in the fluid mechanical literature",
    "the point @xmath15 is referred to as the threshold for convective instability . the term @xmath18 does not change this linear picture but it does imply that the advection speed is reduced as the amplitude of the state grows .",
    "thus nonlinear states are not necessarily advected downstream and can in fact invade the domain ( figure  [ fig : standardtimehistory ] ) . in the following we refer to this behavior as nonlinear absolute instability by analogy with the notion of ( linear ) absolute instability which arises at @xmath19 ,",
    "the parameter value at which the growth rate of the instability is able to compete for the first time with the rate at which a perturbation is swept downstream , i.e. , at @xmath20 the upstream spreading speed exactly balances the downstream advection .",

    "linear theory shows that in the presence of ( nonperiodic ) boundary conditions that preserve the base state @xmath17 this state loses stability at @xmath29 corresponding to the presence of a neutrally stable global eigenmode @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the length of the domain @xcite .",
    "thus instability is delayed , by an @xmath33 amount , from @xmath15 to the vicinity of the onset of absolute instability ( figure [ chomaz_fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the eigenmode @xmath30 is typically compressed against the downstream wall ( we call it a wall mode ) ; as @xmath8 increases an abrupt transition takes place that fills the domain with the @xmath34 state , except for a residual defect near the upstream boundary @xcite .",
    "the above scenario appears to be typical of systems with broken reflection symmetry , confined in a finite domain , provided the primary bifurcation is supercritical .",
    "however , as already mentioned , problem ( [ ccmodel ] ) is expected to become strongly subcritical when @xmath35 is sufficiently large ( in fact , @xmath36 @xcite ) and this fact suggests that a different domain - filling scenario may take place .",
    "figure [ chomaz_fig2 ] shows a typical bifurcation diagram obtained for @xmath36 illustrating these ideas .",
    "we emphasize in particular the abrupt drop in amplitude of the solution near @xmath37 from an @xmath38 amplitude to an apparently exponentially small amplitude . in the present paper",
    "we confirm these results and provide an explanation for the observed behavior in terms of the geometric theory of dynamical systems . in particular , we describe in detail the solution branch shown in figure [ chomaz_fig2](a ) , hereafter referred to as a type ii branch or equivalently as the absolute instability branch . in addition , we uncover a new class of solutions that are present for @xmath39 whenever the upstream boundary condition @xmath40 .",
    "these are located on a type i branch or equivalently the convective instability branch which connects to a type ii branch in different ways depending on the inlet boundary condition @xmath41 .",

    "first , when @xmath42 , a hysteretic transition from the type i solution branch @xmath43 to the type ii solution branch @xmath34 takes place at a subcritical bifurcation at @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 but is `` small enough '' , the small amplitude type i states turn into type ii states when the former undergo a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath46 .",
    "this transition also triggers a hysteretic jump to large amplitude type ii states . for larger @xmath41 the hysteresis disappears and the transition from type i states to type ii states occurs without any stability change . thus the bifurcation diagram in figure [ chomaz_fig2](a ) represents an important but singular case : the limiting bifurcation diagram in figure [ chomaz_fig2](b ) as @xmath47 .",
    "the type i solutions are an analogue of the noise - sustained structures familiar from studies of convectively unstable systems @xcite and hence play an important role in systems with random fluctuations at the inlet . in the present paper",
    "we quantify the precise role played by these solutions in determining the statistics of the location of the front that develops downstream from the inlet in the case of randomly distributed upstream boundary conditions .",

    "<S> a subcritical pattern - forming system with nonlinear advection in a bounded domain is recast as a slow - fast system in space and studied using a combination of geometric singular perturbation theory and numerical continuation . </S>",
    "<S> two types of solutions describing the possible location of stationary fronts are identified , one of which is present for all values of the bifurcation parameter while the other is present for zero or sufficiently small inlet boundary conditions but only when the bifurcation parameter is large enough . for slightly larger inlet boundary condition a continuous transition from one type to the other takes place as the bifurcation parameter increases . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the two solution types is traced to the onset of convective and absolute instability on the real line . </S>",
    "<S> the role of canard trajectories in the transitions between these states is clarified and the stability properties of the resulting spatial structures are determined . </S>",
    "<S> front location in the convective regime is highly sensitive to the upstream boundary condition and its dependence on this boundary condition is studied using a combination of numerical continuation and monte carlo simulations of the partial differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> statistical properties of the system subjected to random or stochastic boundary conditions are interpreted using the deterministic slow - fast spatial - dynamical system .    </S>",
    "<S> spatial dynamics , slow - fast systems , canards , convective and absolute instability </S>"
