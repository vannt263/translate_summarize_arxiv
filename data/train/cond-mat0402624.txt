    "the goal of these model calculations was to establish the plausibility of superconductivity in field - effect devices enhanced or induced by the presence of a polarizable interface , and to investigate the magnitude of the critical temperature and likely dependence on external field and materials properties .",
    "we recognize , however , that several potentially important aspects of the physics are not present in the model used .",
    "these include long - range coulomb interactions , dynamics of the dielectric screening , and correlations in the 2deg .",
    "we anticipate that the effects of long - range coulomb interactions are less important in the present case than in 3d metallic superconductors due to the larger dielectric constants in the insulating material , but this must clearly be justified by a legitimate calculation of the true coulomb pseudopotential entering the macmillan formula .",
    "screening of the bare electron - dipole interaction @xmath188 must also be included ; we expect , however , that the form of the dependence of @xmath0 on the electric field will not change significantly ( see fig .",
    "[ tc_cluster ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of a repulsive local interaction @xmath55 does not qualitatively change this form either .",
    "however it reduces @xmath0 ( by a factor of 2 for @xmath189 ) and it shifts the optimal value of the field - induced doping to lower levels ( cf .",
    "[ finite_u ] ) .",
    "if the effective on - site coulomb repulsion in the drain - source layer is much larger than we have considered , s - wave superconductivity will be completely supressed .",
    "it is still tempting , however , to regard the starting hamiltonian ( [ ht])([hmu ] ) as the hopping of correlated electrons ( as in the @xmath190 model ) where coulomb interactions have already been accounted for . in this case , however , one must implicitly assume that doubly occupied sites have been projected out , so that non - retarded @xmath20-wave superconductivity is impossible . modelling superconductivity within this framework in higher - angular momentum pair channels will require including interactions among the two - level systems at the interface , so as to produce a nonlocal pair potential . while we have not calculated these effects explicitly , as they are technically significantly more difficult , our expectation is that the creation and eventual suppression of the paired state by the electric field will be qualitatively similar to what we have calculated .",
    "this expectation is supported by the observation that an increase in @xmath0 with doping has to result trivially from an enhanced carrier density . moreover ,",
    "the buildup of a field - dependent repulsive interaction @xmath46 has to take place due to the eventual saturation of the dipole moments with electric field , even when the two - level systems interact .",
    "investigations along these lines are in progress .    in addition",
    ", our considerations can in principle be applied to other , more weakly correlated systems than the copper oxides .",
    "our model may be used to treat situations in which the ds - channel contains an attractive @xmath20-wave interaction besides the interface - mediated pairing . in this case",
    "we expect a qualitatively similar behavior with a nonmonotonic @xmath0 .    according to our calculations , devices with thickness of the insulating layer of order 1000    subjected to voltages of order @xmath2  20v could display superconductivity , if an optimal material can be found with a sufficiently large low frequency dielectric constant of order 30 - 100 and strong quasilocalized electronic modes of energy",
    "@xmath191  @xcite . with a 20  v gate field and a typical 18  nf capacitance of a 0.03  @xmath192 gate dielectric ( 1000   ) , this would correspond to a surface charge density of roughly 12  @xmath193 .",
    "it is now routine to fabricate epitaxial high @xmath118 oxide dielectrics , such as srtio@xmath1 with polarizations in the range of 10 - 40  @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "interface - mediated 2d superconductivity therefore seems to us to be plausibly within reach if good interfaces can be manufactured .",

    "<S> we consider the pairing induced in a strictly 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) by a proximate insulating film with polarizable localized excitations . within a model of interacting 2d electrons and localized two - level systems , we calculate the critical temperature @xmath0 as a function of applied voltage and for different materials properties . assuming that a sufficient carrier density can be induced in a field - gated device , we argue that superconductivity may be observable in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is found to be a nonmonotonic function of both electric field and the excitation energy of the two - level systems .    shortly after the publication of the bcs theory of superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> w.  a.  little proposed a possible pairing mechanism for electrons in long organic molecules involving localized electronic excitations in the molecules side chains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested advantages of such an arrangement included the large characteristic energy of the couplings , which might lead to high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) , and the separation of the excitations themselves from the screening effects of the electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> such a pair mechanism has never been realized , presumably due to large fluctuation effects in quasi-1d systems . </S>",
    "<S> later , ginzburg  @xcite and allender , bray and bardeen  @xcite proposed a similar excitonic 2d mechanism in superconductor - semiconductor sandwiches . </S>",
    "<S> the enormous body of early work on this problem has been reviewed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one problem with these schemes is clearly that the localized nature of the excitations implies that at most one or two atomic layers of the intercalating insulator can contribute to the pairing , meaning that the enhancement of pairing in the relatively thick nearby superconductor is negligible .    here </S>",
    "<S> we propose that a similar scheme might work for an insulating layer in proximity with a superconducting layer of near - atomic thickness . </S>",
    "<S> such systems can in principle be prepared in several ways , but the most promising is perhaps the field effect method pioneered in the early 90 s with the intent of increasing the carrier density and hence @xmath0 in htsc cuprate devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work has shown incontrovertibly that @xmath0 and other superconducting properties in metallic samples can be influenced by an applied gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> while the experiments have most often been interpreted in terms of electronic structure variations near the interface , they are not understood in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask if new physics can result from field doping of insulators . in the most recent reports on field - doping of srtio@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> pallecchi _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and ueno _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were able to achieve an areal carrier density of @xmath2  0.010.05 per unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to achieve higher densities due to electrical breakdown in the insulating layer at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> but there seems to be no _ fundamental _ objection to even higher charge densities , since complex oxide dielectrics and ferroelectric oxides can achieve polarizations in the range of @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , very recently the first observation of field - induced superconductivity was reported for a device with a nd@xmath4ba@xmath5cu@xmath1o@xmath6 epitaxial film grown on srtio@xmath1 substrates  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore one may legitimately ask the question what critical temperature can be achieved in a system where the pairing comes entirely from the excitations in the proximate insulating layer , and how @xmath0 is likely to vary with field in this case . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can assume the existence of a 2d superconducting layer with preexisting pair interaction and bare critical temperature @xmath7 , and ask by how much the presence of the insulating layer enhances @xmath0 . while in a strictly 2d system the @xmath0 s referred to can not correspond to true long - range order , the creation of a field - tuned superconducting state with algebraic order at finite temperatures would be of considerable interest and applicability in small devices .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering an insulating amorphous film @xmath8 in proximity to a correlated insulator @xmath9 ( drain - source ( ds ) channel of a field effect device ) , similar to ref .  , with a small density of localized charge carriers . applying an electric field as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ device ] sweeps charge carriers to the interface with the film @xmath8 where they accumulate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the 2d band induced by an electric field has been studied by poilblanc _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume for the moment that in the absence of the film @xmath8 there are no pairing interactions between the electrons in the material @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , we expect the following picture to apply : virtual excitations in the dielectric @xmath8 induce cooper pairing in the adjacent layer @xmath9 . the critical temperature must increase initially with the field since carriers are being injected into the system . with increasing electric field the larger level splitting of the two level system leads to a suppression of the polarization fluctuations and the pair potential decreases . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is therefore expected to reach a maximum at a characteristic field strength ; it is our objective to estimate the scale of possible @xmath0 s through this process , as well as the field strength required to attain it .    </S>",
    "<S> we now propose a crude but concrete framework within which one can calculate these effects . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , the dielectric can have two effects on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> first , it can reduce the coulomb pseudopotential of electrons in the field - doped layer due to the large dielectric constant of the amorphous insulator @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we are more concerned here with the second effect , namely an additional contribution to the residual pairing interaction at the interface due to virtual polarization of the dielectric itself . </S>"
