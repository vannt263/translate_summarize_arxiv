    "[ 2 ] , in the case of the c@xmath2  bilayer , we find that this behavior applies solely to the layer in contact with cu(111 ) and does not impact the topmost layer .",
    "first , the change in electronic density upon binding ( fig .",
    "[ 2 ] ( a ) ) is entirely localized to the bottom layer . moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2](b ) , this leads to a system with a dos reminiscent of schottky - diode , in which the top layer remains a semiconductor with an electron - accepting character , while the bottom c@xmath2  layer is a metal .",
    "interestingly , despite the original energy alignment between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) of the two c@xmath2  layers , the kohn - sham lumo of the top layer is found to sit at 0.58ev above the fermi energy .",
    "we attribute this energy mismatch to the interface dipole at the c@xmath2  /  cu interface , which increases the electrostatic potential  @xcite above the negatively - charge c@xmath2  layer .",
    "we note that this effect has also been observed for smaller charge transfer in the case of c@xmath2  bilayers on au(111 )  @xcite .",
    "the increase of the electrostatic potential also suggests that molecules on top of c@xmath2  /  cu will have their highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) pushed towards the fermi energy , in agreement with our experimental findings that the homo of pentacene lies 0.25 ev below the fermi energy on top of c@xmath2  /  cu  @xcite  which may suggest very low onset voltages are achievable for electron - blocking layers on top of c@xmath2  /  cu .",
    "the functional form of the @xmath3 characteristics can be understood as resulting directly from the unusual dos of the system using the same hypotheses as in the pentacene  /  c@xmath2  /  cu system @xcite .",

    "[ 2 ] ( c ) we plot the laudauer current obtained when the transmission function is the product of the layer - projected dos ( @xmath36 , where v is the potential of the tip and e the energy ) .",

    "the calculated current has the same diodic lineshape as the one observed in experiments with a smaller onset bias ( 0.58 v as compared with @xmath151.0 v found experimentally ) that we attribute to the erroneous kohn - sham level alignment ( because the onset voltage in the forward direction is related to the energy difference between the frontier molecular orbital and the fermi energy of the system ) . finally , we note that the spectrally - broad lumo of the bottom c@xmath2  layer effectively acts in a manner similar to a _ gateway _",

    "in contrast with the metallic behavior of the c@xmath2  monolayer , and in agreement with our theoretical findings , the bilayer shows a larger turn - on voltage as well as reduced current in the reverse direction .",
    "the local variation of the rectification ratio is shown in fig . [ 3 ] ( b ) .",
    "consistent with the average rectification analysis , the local rectification shows that the monolayer is weakly rectifying with a maximum @xmath0 of about 20 , while the bilayer is strongly rectifying with local maximum @xmath0 up to about @xmath39 .",
    "interestingly , we find that , while the rectification ratio is homogeneous in the bilayer , the turn - on voltage is strongly dependent on the distance from the edge of the island and the local intra - layer coordination ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7=1.09  v , fig .",
    "[ 3 ] ( b ) )  @xcite .",
    "such behavior is particularly noticeable around 1  v , where the edge of the bilayer starts rectifying .",
    "a summary of this phenomena is shown in fig . [ 3 ] ( c ) , which shows the spatial dependence of the turn - on voltage ( as defined by the voltage needed for the current to be larger than 1 pa ) .",
    "such turn - on voltage varies from  1 v for the c@xmath2  molecules within the island ( 2d coordination 6 ) to 1.2 v and 1.25 v for those on the edges ( 2d coordination 4 ) and the molecule at the corner ( 2d coordination 3 ) .",

    "blue , black , and red vertical lines correspond to the maxima of the gaussian fit of the top layer dos for the negative , 0- , and positive field cases , respectively .",
    "larger orbital stark shifts are found at lower coverage .",
    "corresponding structural models used in the dft calculations are shown on the right.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    while the number of atoms involved prevents a direct dft calculation of the electronic structure of the edge and corner molecules , we examine the differences between the fully covered bilayer of c@xmath2  on cu(111 ) and the half- and quarter - coverage situations ( coverage referring to the second c@xmath2  layer ) . in figure",
    "[ 4 ] , no significant change is found in the top layer s lumo energies for the three coverages ( within 0.01 ev of each other , as determined by a gaussian fit of the layer - projected density of states ) .",
    "however , we observe more significant differences in the molecular orbital energies response to an external electric field , _ i.e. _ a larger orbital stark effect as coordination is reduced .",
    "specifically , when applying electric fields of @xmath400.02 v /    perpendicular to the surface ( fig .",
    "[ 4 ] ) , we find the energy shift of the lumo to be 70% and 38% larger in the quarter- and half - coverage cases ( @xmath40103 mev and @xmath4083 mev , respectively as compared with @xmath4061 mev for the full coverage case ) due to the change in local dielectric environment .",
    "while the structural and field models both differ from the experimental conditions , the computed magnitude of this effect is compatible with the experimental observation of a 15 - 20% increase of the ` turn - on ' voltage at the edges .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in reference  @xcite in the context of c@xmath2  monolayers and molecules on au(111 ) , changes in local dielectric environment are also conducive to impacting the level alignment through non - local static correlations  an effect beyond the reach of standard dft approaches  @xcite . both stark effect and level alignment renormalization result in the same qualitative behavior : the measured lumo energy increases at lower coordination .",
    "further sts studies on the dependence of the measured lumo energies on the tip - substrate distance should allow to determine the relative magnitude of these two mechanisms .    in conclusion , we have observed large rectification ratios in non - covalent , self - assembled , molecular bilayers of c@xmath2  on cu(111 ) .",
    "using dft , we have shown that , due to its strong coupling with cu(111 ) , the bottom c@xmath2  layer acts as a metallic buffer layer , preserving the semiconducting character of the top c@xmath2  layer while allowing electron and hole injection .",
    "we have analyzed the local variation of the rectification and found that c@xmath2  molecules with smaller coordinations have larger turn - on voltages , a phenomenon we attribute to an enhanced electronic stark effect in a local environment with reduced dielectric screening .",
