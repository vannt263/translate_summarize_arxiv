    "the experiment is situated in hall a at jlab .",
    "a continuous - wave beam of longitudinally polarized 3.03  gev electrons is incident on a 20  cm long liquid hydrogen target .",
    "the highly polarized ( 75 - 85% ) electron beam is generated from a strained - layer gaas photocathode using circularly polarized laser light .",
    "scattered electrons are focused by twin spectrometers onto total - absorption detectors situated in heavily - shielded detector huts , creating a clean separation between elastically scattered electrons and inelastic backgrounds .",
    "the spectrometers are arranged to create an approximately left - right symmetric acceptance .",
    "two separate detector segments in each spectrometer arm cover the full flux of elastically scattered electrons , for a total of 4 detector photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the pmt response is integrated ; the detector elements and the associated electronics are designed to accept an elastic flux rate of @xmath18  mhz at full design luminosity .    the experimental configuration is similar to the previous measurement of @xmath12 at @xmath19 @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the presently reported measurement is enabled by the addition of septum magnets to accept very - forward scattered electrons with @xmath21 , and the introduction of radiation - hard focal plane detectors which can survive the increased scattered electron rate .",
    "this configuration is described in more detail in the recent report on the @xmath12 result with a @xmath22he target  @xcite .",
    "the helicity of the polarized electron beam is set every 33.3 ms ; each of these periods of constant helicity will be referred to as a `` window . ''",
    "the helicity sequence is structured as pairs of windows with opposite helicity ( `` window pairs '' ) , with the helicity of the first window selected pseudo - randomly .",
    "the integrated response of the detector pmts , beam current monitors , and beam position monitors is digitized and recorded into the data stream for each window .",
    "the data sample consists of roughly 11 million helicity - window pairs .",
    "loose requirements are imposed on beam quality which remove periods of current , position , or energy instability from the final data set .",
    "however , no helicity - dependent cuts are applied . after applying selection criteria ,",
    "@xmath23 window pairs remain for further analysis .",
    "the right - left asymmetry in the integrated detector response , normalized to the average beam current for each window , is computed for each window pair and then corrected for fluctuations in the beam trajectory to form the raw asymmetry @xmath24 . the first order dependence on five correlated beam parameters ( energy and horizontal and vertical position and angle ) is removed by two independent analysis methods ; the numerical difference between the two results is negligible compared to the final statistical uncertainty .     for all data , grouped by @xmath25/2-plate state in sequential samples .",
    "the circles and squares represent the average of the 2 pmt channels in each spectrometer arm , and the line represents @xmath24 , averaged over the run and plotted with the appropriate sign for each half - wave plate state . ]",
    "the @xmath24 window - pair distribution has an rms of @xmath26 ppm .",
    "non - gaussian tails are negligible over more than 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "this demonstrates that the distribution is dominated by the counting statistics of an elastically scattered electron rate of @xmath27 mhz .",
    "contributions to the fluctuations from background , electron beam , electronic noise or target density are negligible .    the cumulative correction for @xmath24 due to helicity - correlated differences in electron beam parameters is @xmath28 ppm .",
    "this correction is small compared to the statistical error on @xmath24 due to several important factors .",
    "first , careful attention is given to the design and configuration of the laser optics in the polarized source to reduce helicity - correlated beam asymmetries to a manageable level .",
    "over the duration of data collection , the cumulative helicity - correlated asymmetries in the electron beam are 0.022 ppm in energy , 8 nm in position , and 4 nrad in angle .",
    "additionally , the asymmetry averaged over all pmts is quite insensitive to the beam trajectory due to the symmetric detector configuration .",
    "the largest correction of -0.130 ppm is from the beam monitor that is predominantly sensitive to the helicity - correlated beam energy asymmetry .",
    "the systematic error in the correction is estimated by studying residual correlations of beam asymmetries with the responses of individual pmts , which are significantly more sensitive to the beam trajectory due to the division of the elastic peak over the detector segmentation .",
    "the effect of charge normalization is a 2.6  ppm correction to the detector - response asymmetry .",
    "dedicated calibration runs are used to constrain the relative alinearity between the beam monitors and the detectors ( @xmath29% ) and the absolute alinearity of the detector pmts ( @xmath30% ) .",
    "no alinearity correction to @xmath24 is applied , while an uncertainty of 0.015  ppm is assigned .",
    "a half - wave ( @xmath25/2 ) plate is periodically inserted into the laser optical path , passively reversing the sign of the electron beam polarization .",
    "roughly equal statistics are thus accumulated with opposite signs for the measured asymmetry , which suppresses many systematic effects .",
    "figure  [ figure : slugplot ] shows @xmath24 for all data , averaged over the 2 pmt channels in each spectrometer , grouped by @xmath25/2-plate state and divided into 6 sequential samples .",
    "the observed fluctuations are consistent with purely statistical fluctuations around the average parity - violating asymmetry , shown on the plot with the expected sign flip due to half wave plate state , with a @xmath31 per degree of freedom of 1.0 .",
    "the physics asymmetry @xmath12 is formed from @xmath24 by correcting for beam polarization , backgrounds , and finite acceptance : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the beam polarization , @xmath34 are background fractions and @xmath35 the associated background asymmetries , and @xmath36 accounts for the range of kinematic acceptance .",
    "the beam polarization measured by the hall a compton polarimeter  @xcite is determined to be @xmath37 , averaged over the duration of the run .",
    "the result is consistent , within systematic uncertainties , with dedicated polarization measurements using mller scattering in hall a and mott scattering in the low - energy injector .",
    "the average @xmath38 is determined to be @xmath39 by dedicated low - current runs ; the uncertainty in this value contributes to the systematic error of the asymmetry .",
    "the acceptance correction to account for the non - linear dependence of the asymmetry with @xmath16 is computed , using a monte carlo simulation , to be @xmath40 .",
    "largely due to the excellent hardware resolution of the spectrometers ( @xmath41% ) , the total dilution to the pmt response from all background sources is less than 1% .",
    "the largest contribution of 0.9%  comes from the aluminum windows of the cryogenic target .",
    "the asymmetry of the background is of the same sign and similar magnitude to that of @xmath12 from elastic scattering off hydrogen , which reduces its effect on the measurement .",
    "while inelastic scattering backgrounds do not directly reach the detectors , dedicated runs are used to estimate the contribution from charged particles which rescatter inside the spectrometers .",
    "rates in the detectors are studied as the central spectrometer momentum is varied .",
    "individual scattered electrons are tracked , using drift chambers at low beam currents , to determine the location of rescattering in the spectrometer .",
    "from these studies , an upper limit on @xmath12 due to possible rescattering from polarized iron or unpolarized material is determined to be 0.031 ppm .",
    "the corrections are summarized in table  [ table : acorrections ] . after all corrections , the result at @xmath42 is @xmath43 additional details of this analysis are given in  @xcite .",
