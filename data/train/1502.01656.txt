    "however , co - author ( rp ) numerically calculated @xmath2 for these finite @xmath0 analytic equilibria and found numerical results substantially different from the @xmath2 given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the reasons for this difference are identified as resulting from a subtle misuse of an expression for @xmath6 resolution of this issue revealed that the analytic equilibria presented in ref.@xcite could be extended to give an interesting toroidal equilibria where @xmath7 the pressure on the magnetic axis of a toroid is lower than the pressure at the surface ( edge ) of the toroid rather than higher as in a tokamak ; i.e. , the beta profile is inverted and the configuration is bubble - like .",
    "increase of a parameter @xmath8 ( to be defined below ) results in solutions to a grad - shafranov equation evolving from characterizing finite @xmath0 spheromak equilibria , to a conventional zero @xmath9spheromak , to magnetic bubbles  which are tokamak - like configurations having inverted @xmath0 profiles , and then to a tokamak with conventional @xmath0 profile .",
    "this evolution is characterized by the ratio of two bessel functions changing sign as their argument @xmath10 is progressively increased .",
    "interplanetary magnetic clouds are an example of the magnetic bubble situation because on the magnetic axis these clouds have lower hydrodynamic pressure than at their edge .",
    "magnetic clouds have been previously modeled using numerical solutions to grad - shafranov equations @xcite,@xcite in a slab approximation ( i.e. , equations are solved in cartesian geometry in the @xmath11 plane with the @xmath12 direction ignorable ) ; the model presented here differs by being analytic and axisymmetric ( i.e. , equations are solved in cylindrical geometry in the @xmath13 plane with the @xmath14 direction ignorable ) so that , in contrast to a slab approximation , toroidal geometry effects are inherently included .",
    "the analytic model has only a few parameters and so has less freedom than a numerical model but nevertheless has the useful feature of revealing parametric dependence and scaling .",
    "the analytic model also offers the possibility of providing a useful framework for other calculations , for example , calculating particle orbits in an axisymmetric cloud ; the virtues of developing a repertoire of analytic solutions to the grad - shafranov equation has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we use  a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath15 and consider the general axisymmetric magnetic field@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the poloidal flux function and @xmath18 is the toroidal field .",
    "the @xmath14 direction is called the toroidal direction and any direction lying in the poloidal plane ( @xmath13 plane ) is called a poloidal direction . from ampere s law",
    "the associated current density is@xmath19    we are interested in configurations where the poloidal flux function has a local extremum in the @xmath20 plane ; both spheromaks and tokamaks are this type of configuration .",
    "the location of this extremum is called the magnetic axis and its vertical location defines the @xmath12 origin while its radial location is defined to be @xmath21 @xmath17 is thus at a maximum or a minimum at @xmath22 @xmath23 if @xmath17 is at a maximum on the magnetic axis then @xmath24 is positive at the axis whereas if @xmath17 is at a minimum on the magnetic axis then @xmath24 is negative at the axis .",
    "spheromaks and tokamaks are characterized by the safety factor @xmath1 which is the number of times a field line goes around toroidally for each time it goes poloidally around the magnetic axis .",
    "tokamaks typically have near - unity @xmath1 on the magnetic axis with @xmath1 increasing with increasing distance from the magnetic axis whereas spheromaks have near - unity @xmath1 on the magnetic axis and @xmath1 decreasing on moving away from the magnetic axis .",
    "the @xmath7 gradient of @xmath25 denoted as @xmath26 provides stability properties and detailed calculations show that a zero @xmath0 spheromak has small @xmath27    the safety factor at the magnetic axis is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a measure of the ellipticity of @xmath30 in the vicinity of the magnetic axis such that @xmath31 corresponds to vertically elongated equilibria ( prolate ) while @xmath32 corresponds to vertically shortened equilibria ( oblate ) .",
    "the force - free relation @xmath33 was invoked in ref .",
    "@xcite to give @xmath34 but this result is valid only if the plasma is indeed force - free ( i.e. , has zero @xmath0 and equilibrium given by @xmath35 ) . if @xmath0 is finite , then  @xmath36 and it is necessary to calculate the actual value of @xmath37 by consideration of the details of the finite @xmath0 equilibrium .    to do this , we start by defining @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the hydrodynamic pressures on the magnetic axis and on the last closed flux surface .",

    "consider the situation where @xmath213 and @xmath135 in this case @xmath133 so the poloidal flux surfaces are circular near the magnetic axis , the last closed flux surface is at @xmath214 and from eq.[neg beta ] @xmath215 from eq.[aspect ] , it is seen that the inverse aspect ratio is @xmath216 figure 2 plots contours of @xmath217 and it is seen that the last closed flux surface intersects @xmath76 to the right of the magnetic axis at indeed @xmath218 figures 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 plot @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221 and @xmath222respectively .        so the hydrodynamic pressure on the magnetic axis is lower than on the last closed flux surface .",
    "if @xmath40 is set to zero , then the external pressure would be @xmath224 in which case the configuration would be a vacuum at the magnetic axis ( zero plasma pressure ) with increasing pressure going away from the magnetic axis toward last closed flux surface .",
    "if @xmath8 is further increased , the sign of @xmath38 can become positive again in which case the equilibrium will become tokamak - like ( higher pressure on magnetic axis ) .",
    "additional increase of @xmath8 will cause @xmath38 to oscillate in sign giving a sequence of bubble - like and tokamak - like configurations .",
    "also , for a given configuration one could elect to truncate the flux at some value larger than @xmath53 and so obtain a smaller aspect ratio equilibrium . in accordance with the shafranov virial theorem , any one of these configurations will involve a jump in the magnetic field at the surface of the toroid if it is assumed that at the surface the external magnetic field differs from the internal field .",
    "this jump corresponds to the existence of surface currents . in a tokamak",
    "these surface currents are provided by a set of coils immediately external to the toroidal volume and these coils are called the vertical field coils .",
    "the field produced by these coils is mainly in the @xmath12 direction and will be referred to here as @xmath225 .",
    "this field @xmath225 constitutes a portion of the total field inside the toroidal volume and provides equilibrium in the major radius direction .",
    "this takes place via a radial force @xmath226 directed towards @xmath227that balances the radially outward hoop force as well as some hydrodynamic pressure forces .",
    "the hoop force is a property of any toroidal current system and occurs because a toroidal current produces a stronger poloidal field near @xmath228 , @xmath76 ( inside )  than at @xmath229 @xmath230(outside)@xmath46 this stronger poloidal field on the inside compared to the outside corresponds to greater magnetic pressure on the inside than on the outside ; for low @xmath0 the force resulting from magnetic pressure imbalance dominates any hydrodynamic pressure imbalance . without the offsetting force provided by @xmath225",
    "the hoop force would act to expand the torus major radius .    at first sight",
    "it might appear that the flux contours in fig.2 are such that the magnetic pressure is higher on the outside than on the inside because the midplane poloidal flux surfaces in fig . 2",
    "are more tightly packed outside the magnetic axis ( e.g. , at @xmath231 than inside the magnetic axis ( e.g. , at @xmath232 ) .",
    "however , the density of field lines and hence the poloidal field is nevertheless stronger inside the magnetic axis than outside because of the inverse @xmath174 dependence in @xmath233 .",
    "the twice as tight midplane flux surface packing in fig .",
    "2 at @xmath234 compared to at @xmath232 gives a twice as large @xmath235 on the outside compared to the inside . however ,",
    "this twice as tight radial packing is overcome by the @xmath236 factor , a toroidal geometry effect that produces an approximately six - fold inside - to - outside enhancement with the net result that @xmath237 is about three times larger at @xmath232 than at @xmath238 .",
    "this three - fold inside - to - outside ratio of @xmath237 is evident in fig .",
    "@xmath7    in order to have the @xmath225 required  for equilibrium , it would be necessary to have surface currents flowing on the surface of the toroid .",
    "since there are no powered coils to sustain surface currents exterior to a magnetic cloud , it is unlikely that such surface currents would exist in the magnetic cloud context . without the @xmath225 provided by surface currents  ( and intrinsic to the equilibrium given here ) ,",
    "the hoop force resulting from the imbalance between @xmath239 on the inside and @xmath239 on the outside will cause the major radius of magnetic clouds to increase with time .",
    "the difference between poloidal flux surfaces with and without incorporation of @xmath225 is of the order of the inverse aspect ratio @xmath240 because @xmath241 is a toroidal effect and so scales as @xmath242      the spheromak solution required @xmath71 to be zero to avoid singularity at @xmath88 the magnetic bubble solution discussed above used the same functional form as the spheromak solution ( i.e. , had @xmath90 and used eq.[gs solve ] ) and found that a tokamak - like solution with @xmath160 @xmath7(i.e . , inverted beta profile ) occurred if @xmath243 if @xmath228 is excluded from the domain so the configuration is _ doubly - connected _ , the singular nature of @xmath89 at @xmath228 is no longer a constraint and the more general solution given by eqs .",

    "the consequence of imposing @xmath90 was for eq.[solve sigmay ] to force the relationship  between @xmath92 and @xmath8 given by eq.[q ] .",
    "if @xmath71 is not forced to be zero , then this relationship between @xmath92 and @xmath8 is no longer imposed and the only remaining condition is that the domain must exclude @xmath88    consideration of eq.[gs soln ] and recalling the discussion that led to eq.[rlc ] shows that @xmath244 is independent of @xmath175 at @xmath185 where @xmath185 is now defined by @xmath245 thus eq.[rlc more general ] provides a radial shift of the location of the last closed flux surface and generalizes the discussion that led to eq.[rlc ] . because @xmath70 and @xmath71 depend on @xmath8 and on @xmath92 ( hence on @xmath38 ) , eq.[rlc more general ] shows that @xmath185 depends on both @xmath8 and @xmath123 however , by assumption @xmath246 ( last closed flux surface radius is to the right of the magnetic axis ) which restricts the allowed values of @xmath8 and @xmath38 .",
