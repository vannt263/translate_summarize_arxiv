    "the actual sources of the cosmic rays ( crs ) are still unknown , although it is believed that the vast majority of those observed with energies @xmath0  eev ( where @xmath1  ev ) are of galactic origin , probably accelerated in supernova explosions , while those with energies above few eev are most likely of extra - galactic origin , probably accelerated in active galaxies or gamma ray bursts .",
    "the precise energy at which the transition between galactic and extra - galactic crs takes place is under debate , with different proposals locating it near the second - knee ( a steepening of the spectrum at @xmath2  eev ) or near the ankle ( a flattening of the spectrum observed at @xmath3  eev ) .",
    "the main observables available to infer the cr properties are the energy spectrum , the composition indicators , and the anisotropies in the arrival directions measured at different angular scales . in particular , the changes in the slope of the spectrum just mentioned could for instance be indicating a change in the propagation properties ( such as an enhanced escape from the galaxy starting at the second knee ) or a change in the source population ( such as the dominance of the extra - galactic component above the ankle ) , and some combination of these can also take place at intermediate energies . in addition , other effects such as the impact of pair production energy losses on extragalactic protons interacting with the cmb or diffusion effects from nearby sources can also contribute in shaping the spectrum at eev energies .",
    "regarding the measured composition , the kascade - grande surface detector experiment @xcite suggests a predominantly heavy composition just below 0.1  eev , as would be expected for a galactic component in scenarios in which the acceleration or the confinement of crs in the galaxy depend on the rigidity of the particles , so that galactic protons start to be suppressed at the observed steepening at the knee ( for @xmath4  ev ) , while fe nuclei get suppressed only at an energy 26 times larger , which is close to the location of the second - knee .",
    "a puzzling fact is that the maxima in the air shower development as well as the shower maxima fluctuations , determined using the fluorescence technique @xcite , suggest that at eev energies the composition is predominantly light .",
    "however , a proton component at eev energies can hardly be of galactic origin , since besides the difficulty of devising appropriate galactic sources that could reach such high rigidities , the galactic protons would be expected to give rise to strong anisotropies towards the direction of the galactic plane , contributing to both a dipolar and a quadrupolar component in large scale anisotropy searches , which are not observed @xcite .",
    "actually , the large scale anisotropies in right ascension reported by auger are below @xmath5% at eev energies , and show a marginally significant indication of a transition from a direction near @xmath6 below 1  eev , which is consistent with the direction of the galactic center , towards directions near @xmath7 above the ankle energy , with an amplitude increasing to the several percent level near 10  eev .    in this paper",
    "we want to consider in detail the predictions for the anisotropies produced by a nearby extragalactic source in the case in which crs diffuse due to the presence of sizeable turbulent magnetic fields in the local supercluster , so that spatial diffusion is relevant , having in mind that this may significantly contribute to the cr anisotropies at eev energies .",
    "some studies of this kind were performed in the past @xcite , and here we improve on the treatment of the diffusion effects , adopting a more accurate energy dependence for the diffusion coefficients and we obtain a detailed matching between the diffusive and quasi - rectilinear regimes , finding analytic fits to the results and validating them with different numerical simulations of cr trajectories in turbulent fields .",
    "we also discuss the possible transition between a few sources contributing at low energies to a regime were many sources contribute at higher energies , considering also the effects of their possibly non - isotropic spatial distribution . as by - products of this work we provide in section  3 detailed fits to the diffusion coefficients as a function of the energy for kolmogorov and kraichnan turbulence , covering the transition between the resonant and non - resonant regimes .",
    "we also provide in appendix  ii simple fits to the proton attenuation lengths which allow for an analytic treatment of the effects of proton energy losses .",
    "turbulent magnetic fields may be produced in the universe from the evolution of primordial seeds affected by the process of structure formation .",
    "this typically leads to magnetic fields with strength correlated with the matter density ( @xmath8 due to the flux conservation during the collapse ) , and hence being enhanced in dense regions such as superclusters while suppressed in the voids .",
    "extragalactic magnetic fields may also result from galactic outflows , in which galactic b fields are transported by winds into the intra - cluster medium .",
    "although magnetic fields with @xmath9 g strengths have been measured in cluster cores , at supercluster scales they are expected to be smaller , and values from ng up to @xmath10  ng have been considered , adopting for their coherence length typical values of order 0.11  mpc @xcite .",
    "we will start by considering individual cr sources in the local supercluster , at distances @xmath11  mpc , assuming for simplicity that a uniform isotropic turbulent magnetic field is present within the diffusion region .",
    "the field will be characterized by a root mean square strength @xmath12 .",
    "an important property is the distribution of the magnetic energy density @xmath13 on different length scales , usually described adopting a power law in fourier space @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence corresponds to @xmath15 , and is obtained when the initial energy is injected at the maximum scale @xmath16 and is then transferred to lower scales by wave interactions until it dissipates at the scale @xmath17 . alternatively , the kraichnan spectrum with @xmath18 is expected to result in the case of mhd waves .",
    "several magnetic field properties are discussed in the appendix i. in particular the coherence length of the field @xmath19 , defined as in @xcite , satisfies @xmath20 where @xmath17 and @xmath16 are the minimum and maximum scales of the turbulence spectrum .",
    "note that in the case in which @xmath21 , as we will consider in the following , one has @xmath22 for kolmogorov , while @xmath23 for kraichnan turbulence .",
    "an effective larmor radius can be introduced as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the particle charge . a crucial quantity to characterize",
    "the particle diffusion is the critical energy @xmath26 , defined such that @xmath27 and hence given by    @xmath28    this critical energy separates the regimes of resonant diffusion at low energies , in which particles have large deflections induced by their interactions with the @xmath29 field modes with scales comparable to the larmor radius , and the non - resonant regime at high energies in which the deflections after traversing a distance @xmath19 are small , typically of order @xmath30 .    for isotropic diffusion the particle flux is given by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the particle density and @xmath33 the diffusion coefficient , and hence the average distance from the sources @xmath34 after crs travel for a time @xmath35 satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath37 characterizes the distance after which the deflection of the particles is @xmath38  rad .",
    "in particular for @xmath39 one has that @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 one has @xmath43 , since in the latter regime one needs to traverse @xmath44 coherent domains to have a total deflection @xmath45  rad , where @xmath46 results from the random angular diffusion of the cr trajectory .",
    "the low and high energy coefficients @xmath47 are of order unity and will be discussed in section  4 , together with a detailed fit to the diffusion length in the transition region at intermediate energies . as long as the source distance is much larger than @xmath48 , spatial diffusion of the cr particles",
    "will take place . at sufficiently large energies",
    "@xmath48 will become larger than @xmath49 and one will enter the quasi - rectilinear regime in which the total deflection of the particles arriving from the source is less than 1  rad , and hence only some angular diffusion will occur but not the spatial diffusion .",
    "the onset of the quasi - rectilinear regime corresponds to the condition @xmath50 , and hence this happens for @xmath51 ( where we assumed that @xmath52 so that @xmath53 , which is indeed the case if @xmath54 ) .",
    "the extragalactic cr diffusion can modify the spectrum of the particles reaching the earth , specially at low energies ( @xmath55 ) due to a magnetic horizon effect @xcite , and can also be crucial in the determination of the anisotropies observed , as we discuss below .",
    "we are interested in the first place in computing the dipolar component of the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays coming from a source at a given distance @xmath49 in the presence of a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we want to study its dependence on the energy of the particles and consider the transition from the diffusive propagation at low energies to the quasi - rectilinear propagation at high energies .    in the diffusion regime ,",

    "at the largest energies , above the gzk cutoff , a steep increase of the anisotropy results as the number of contributing sources decreases .",
    "note that the computations are performed using the stochastic results ( section 4.2 ) for energies above @xmath26 , while below @xmath26 the diffusion solution from section  3 is used .",
    "this explains the small jumps observed in the plots at @xmath202 .",
    "one should also keep in mind that fixing the distances to the sources to the mean expected values and considering equal intrinsic luminosity sources leads to an underestimation of the dispersion in the plots , although the mean values should not be much affected by these approximations .",
    ",    1.0 truecm    we can also wonder how close to the direction towards the closest source is expected to be the direction of the total dipole .",
    "the mean and dispersion in 1000 simulations of the cosine of the angle between them is shown in figure [ cosq1 ] .",
    "we see that the mean angle in the case @xmath200 ng and @xmath191 mpc@xmath192 ( left panel , solid lines ) rises from about @xmath203 at @xmath204 0.1 eev to @xmath205 for 1 eev and @xmath206 for @xmath207 eev .",
    "these values increase a bit for larger densities and decrease for larger @xmath29 ( right panel ) .    1.0 truecm    the previous results hold for homogeneously distributed sources .",
    "if the sources themselves have instead an inhomogeneous distribution around the observer , in particular with their distribution having a non - vanishing dipole , a further contribution to the anisotropy is expected .",
    "if the local distribution of cosmic ray sources follows the local distribution of matter , actually a non - vanishing dipole is expected .",
    "this dipolar component of the matter distribution is indeed known to be responsible for the local group peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the cmb , that actually gives rise to the observed cmb dipole .",
    "the dipolar component of the mass distribution in our neighborhood has been estimated using different catalogs of galaxies as for example the 2 micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ) , showing that the resulting dipole seemingly converges when sources up to a distance @xmath208 mpc are included @xcite .",
    "the effect of the local inhomogeneity of the source distribution in the predicted large scale anisotropies can be included in the simulations by choosing the positions of the sources in our neighborhood from some catalog representing the local distribution of matter .",
    "to describe the local distribution of matter we use a volume limited subsample 100 mpc and absolute magnitude in the k band @xmath209 of the 2mrs catalog up to 100  mpc @xcite .",
    "we have then selected the position of the required number of sources ( according to the density considered ) from this subsample of 2mrs galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the locations of sources farther away were assumed to be isotropically distributed .",
    "we show in figure [ dip2mrs ] the change in the mean dipole amplitude when the inhomogeneous source distribution is considered for a density @xmath210 mpc@xmath192 and a turbulent field of @xmath200 ng .",
    "an enhancement of the dipole amplitude of about @xmath211 on average is observed with respect to the isotropic case .",
    "we have considered in detail the diffusion of charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields , obtaining through numerical simulations of the trajectories expressions for the diffusion coefficients .",
    "we focused in the computation of the dipolar anisotropies , matching the analytic and numerical results of the high energy regime of angular diffusion ( quasi rectilinear propagation ) with the low energy regime of spatial diffusion .",
    "we illustrated the results for typical values of @xmath2123  eev and @xmath213  mpc , showing that the dipole amplitude resulting from sources with number densities of @xmath214 to @xmath215  mpc@xmath192 are at the level of ( 0.51)% at 0.1  eev energies , increasing to ( 12)% at 1  eev and up to ( 310)% at 10  eev ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "when the anisotropy in the local ( within 100  mpc ) distribution of sources , modeled following the 2mrs galaxy catalog , is taken into account , an increase in the expected dipole amplitude typically by a factor 1.5 to 2 is predicted . in this case",
    "this contribution would point in the approximate direction of the motion of the local group with respect to the cmb rest frame @xcite .",
    "] , since it is just the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution that is ultimately responsible for both the proper motion of the local group and for the anisotropy in the cr source distribution .",
    "these anisotropies are significantly larger than the ones that would result from the compton - getting effect @xcite if crs were isotropic in the rest frame of the cmb , which would be at the level of @xmath216% almost independently of the energy .",
    "it should be mentioned that the further deflections of the crs caused by the galactic magnetic field ( mostly by the regular component ) , not included in this work , would modify the cr dipole amplitude and direction as well as generate higher order multipoles in the arrival directions distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this effect could reduce to some extent the amplitudes obtained here for energies below few eev .",
    "finally , in this work we obtained the dipolar anisotropies under the assumption of a proton cr composition ( which is consistent with the observations at eev energies and also compatible with hires and telescope array measurements at higher energies @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the cr composition were to become heavier above a few eev , as suggested by the auger observatory measurements @xcite , the anisotropies above the ankle will depend on the details of the actual source composition .",
    "the dipolar amplitudes computed in this work are of interest to interpret the recent results obtained by the auger observatory hinting at non - vanishing dipolar amplitudes at energies above @xmath217  eev @xcite , and the possible connection of these results with the non - uniform distribution of nearby sources should be further scrutinized .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field is modeled as a gaussian random field with zero mean and root mean square value @xmath12 .",
    "this can be described by a superposition of fourier modes as @xcite    @xmath218    where the phases @xmath219 are random . under the assumption of isotropic and homogeneous turbulence",

    "the wavenumbers of the modes were distributed with a constant logarithmic spacing between @xmath243 and @xmath244 , since more modes are required at larger scales for a better approximation to isotropic turbulence .",
