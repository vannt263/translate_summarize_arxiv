    "reliable stellar mass estimates are of crucial importance to achieve a better understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "stellar mass estimates are complementary to other measures of galaxy stellar populations , such as star formation rates ( sfrs ) and age .",
    "they tend to be more accurate than estimates of sfr , which suffer from larger uncertainties due to degeneracies between dust , age , and metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , stellar mass estimates are also potentially affected by systematic uncertainties .",
    "the latter primarily originate from our limited knowledge of several properties of the stellar populations , such as their metallicity , which is not well constrained by a fit to broad - band photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the extinction curve , or some phases of stellar evolution .",
    "the most striking example is the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase @xcite  the modeling of which is still debated @xcite  which has a relevant contribution to the near - ir emission of galaxies dominated by intermediate - age stellar populations ( @xmath01 gyr ) .",
    "another difficulty when estimating galaxy stellar masses is properly reconstructing their star formation histories ( sfhs ) , which are usually approximated by simple ( but not necessarily appropriate ) parametric functions .    despite the systematics discussed above",
    ", high quality photometry and accurate redshifts may significantly improve the reliability of the measured stellar masses . the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , @xcite , pis : s. faber , h. ferguson ) is of great help in this regard , thanks to its exquisite quality near - ir photometry taken with the wfc3 camera on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "candels observations include some of the deepest images in the visible and near - ir ever achieved over a wide area , and have been complemented with the best auxiliary photometry available in the mid - ir with spitzer space telescope and in the ultraviolet with ground - based observations .",
    "thanks to the combination of depth and area covered , stellar masses from the candels project can greatly improve our knowledge of the galaxy stellar mass assembly process , both in a statistical sense ( e.g. , they allow a robust measure of the galaxy stellar mass functions ; @xcite , g15 hereafter , @xcite ) and for dedicated analyses of interesting , faint and distant sources .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present and accompany the release of candels stellar mass catalogs for the great observatories origins deep survey - south ( goods - s , @xcite ) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) ultra - deep survey ( uds , @xcite ) fields .",
    "this is the third of a series of papers that combine the effort of several teams within the candels collaboration to achieve an improved result . in the first paper ,",
    "@xcite ( d13 hereafter ) presented and compared photometric redshifts computed by eleven teams and demonstrated that the combination of multiple results is able to reduce the scatter and outlier fraction in the photometric redshifts . in the second work in the series ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m15 hereafter ) , we performed a comprehensive study of stellar mass measurements and analyzed the main sources of uncertainties and the associated error budget by using mock galaxy catalogs based on semi - analytical models as well as observed catalogs .",
    "biases of the ten different fitting techniques turned out to be relatively small , and tended to be confined to galaxies younger than @xmath0100 myr , where models with a fine spacing of the model grid in age and extinction appeared to perform best . the faintest and lowest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) galaxies were found to be affected by the largest scatter .",
    "degeneracies between stellar mass , age , and extinction were disentangled .    in this work we present and publicly release stellar masses computed from the official candels photometric and redshift catalogs by ten teams , each adopting their preferred assumptions in terms of sfh , stellar modeling and stellar parameters .",
    "we then combine these estimates to suppress the effect of systematics deriving from the choice of specific assumptions and priors in each of the methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : data ] presents candels photometric and redshift catalogs ; section [ sec : mass ] describes how stellar masses were estimated by the different teams , whose results are compared in section  [ sec : scattermethods ] ; the official candels stellar masses are presented in section  [ sec : refmass ] ; finally , we summarize the main results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system , and the following cosmology has been adopted : h@xmath6 = 70 km / s / mpc , @xmath7 @xmath8 0.3 , and @xmath9 = 0.7 .",
    "the candels multiwavelength group has adopted a standardized method to build catalogs in the candels fields .",
    "sources are extracted from the candels f160w mosaic using sextractor .",
    "total fluxes of the sources in the high - resolution hst bands ( wfc3 and acs ) are derived from the aperture - corrected isophotal colors from sextractor , run in dual mode on psf - matched images ( where the psf is the point spread function ) .",
    "the photometry of the lower - resolution dataset ( e.g. ,  ground - based and spitzer ) is derived using the template - fitting software tfit @xcite . in brief",
    ", tfit uses the _ a - priori _ information on the source location and surface brightness profile on the f160w image to measure its photometry on the low - resolution image .",

    "photometric redshifts have been computed for all candels sources using the official multiwavelength photometry catalogs described above .",

    "we removed from the present analysis all objects flagged for having bad photometry ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this information is available in the photometric catalogs as well in the catalogs we release with the present work .",
    "stars have been classified either spectroscopically or photometrically , and have been removed from the sample .",
    "151 and 47 sources were identified as spectroscopic stars in goods - s and uds , respectively .",
    "no stellar mass nor any other parameter is provided in the catalogs for these sources .",
    "photometric stellar candidates have been selected through the morphological information provided by sextractor on the f160w band ( class_star@xmath460.95 ) combined with the requirement that s / n is larger than 20 , which ensures reliability of the class_star parameter . the total number of high s / n point - like candidates is 174 in goods - s and 224 in uds .",
    "fainter point - like sources are not flagged as stars due to unreliability of the morphological criterion for low s / n sources , and conservatively included in this analysis .    finally , candels catalogs have been cross - matched with x - ray sources from the _ chandra _ 4ms catalogs of @xcite and @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the goods - s field and with the _ xmm - newton _ sample of @xcite in the uds field .",
    "we flag x - ray selected agn candidates and do not use them in the comparisons shown in this paper .",
    "we remind the reader that a non detection in x - ray does not prove that the source does not host an agn , because agn detection depends on the depth of the x - ray survey and on the level of obscuration .",
    "dedicated works on ir agn in all the candels fields are in preparation within the candels collaboration .",
    "although we exclude agns from the present comparison , masses for agn candidates have been computed using the same technique as for non active galaxies and are released in the catalogs . in goods - s they were computed by fixing the redshift to the photometric value obtained by fitting the photometry with hybrid templates , as described by @xcite .",
    "this approach provides reliable mass estimates for the large majority of obscured agns , whose sed is dominated by the stellar component @xcite .",
    "we caution that the stellar mass estimate may not recover the true value for bright unobscured agns , where ad - hoc techniques should be adopted @xcite .",
    "however , these sources make up only 8% of the agn sample in goods - s @xcite , which , due to the small area , only rarely includes very bright agns .",
    "no dedicated photometric redshifts for agns were computed in uds .",
    "these are going to be presented in a more complete future work on agns in all candels fields .",
    "stellar masses are commonly estimated by fitting the observed multiwavelength photometry with stellar population synthesis templates ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , bc03 hereafter , @xcite , @xcite , cb07 hereafter , @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the most widely used metric for goodness of fit is @xmath47",
    ". a grid for the free parameters must be set , and model spectra , computed by fixing these parameters to the values in each step of the grid , are compared with observed fluxes .",
    "the best - fit parameters are either provided by the template minimizing @xmath47 or computed as the median of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "for some codes , the pdf of stellar mass is computed from the @xmath47 contingency tables ; for others , the likelihood contours are determined in all the fitting parameters using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling , and the stellar mass pdf is determined by marginalizing over the other parameters . in this case , parameters are allowed to vary on a continuous space , which is explored by means of a random walk . in the case of the speedymc code @xcite ,",
    "used by one of the participating teams , multi - linear interpolation between the pre - computed spectra is used to compute the model seds .",
    "the final best - fit parameters are the average of the posterior pdf , which is proportional to the frequency of visited locations .",
    "free parameters in the models include stellar metallicity , age ( defined as time since the onset of star formation ) , dust reddening , and the parameters describing the sfh of the galaxy",
    ". moreover , several assumptions have to be made , such as the choice of the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) and the extinction law .",
    "one of the most important assumptions for shaping the final templates is the parameterization of the sfh .",
    "the star formation process in galaxies can be very complicated and may have a stochastic nature . in the attempt of reproducing the real sfh ,",
    "several simple analytic functions are usually adopted .",
    "the most popular functions are :    * exponentially declining laws , the so - called @xmath48 models ( or direct-@xmath48 models ) : @xmath49 ; * exponentially increasing laws , also called inverted-@xmath48 models : @xmath50 ; * constant sfh : @xmath51 ; * instantaneous bursts : @xmath52 .",
    "some more complicated shapes include :    * the so - called delayed-@xmath48 models , i.e. , rising - declining laws : e.g. , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ; * truncated sfh : @xmath51 if @xmath55 , @xmath56 otherwise ;    and even more complex functional forms that have been proposed by previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to investigate possible systematics due to different assumptions , ten teams within the candels collaboration computed the stellar masses on the same released catalogs and on the same redshifts .",
    "good quality spectroscopic redshifts were used when available , and the official candels bayesian photometric redshifts ( dahlen et al . in prep . )",
    "were adopted for all other galaxies .",
    "following the same notation as d13 and m15 , we designate each team with a code .",
    "codes are composed of a number identifying the team pi , of a letter indicating the stellar templates used , and if appropriate the subscript @xmath57 to indicate that purely exponentially decreasing @xmath48 models have been assumed to parameterize the sfh .",
    "each of the teams was free to choose their favorite assumptions and set their preferred parameter grid .",
    "although most of the teams adopted bc03 stellar templates , other libraries were also used .",
    "table [ tab : param1 ] summarizes , for each of the participant teams , the fitting technique , the code used to fit the data , the stellar templates adopted , the main assumptions in terms of imf , sfh , extinction law , the ranges of the parameter grid employed , and the priors applied to the template library .",
    "the grid steps differ one from the other , as indicated in table [ tab : param1 ] , and may in some cases vary over the range covered .",
    "most mass estimates presented in this work adopt a @xcite attenuation curve , while one method ( method 6a@xmath57 ) treats the extinction curve as a free parameter , and allows it to vary between a @xcite and a smc @xcite one .",
    "three teams also include nebular emission lines and nebular continuum in one case in addition to stellar emission in the model templates :    * method 4b : the strength of the h@xmath58 line is computed from the number of ionizing photons for a given age and metallicity assuming case b recombination and null escape fraction , and line ratios for 119 lines are taken from the cloudy models of @xcite ( see @xcite ) ; * method 11a@xmath57 : the addition of ly@xmath59 , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath59 and h@xmath58 is done following the recipe of @xcite , who adopted the relation from @xcite between uv luminosity , sfr and [ oii ] flux , and applied line ratios to predict the flux in the other lines ; * method 14a : the flux from the nebular continuum and line emission is included by tracking the number of lyman - continuum photons and assuming case b recombination and null escape fraction , and modeling the empirical line intensities relative to h@xmath58 for h , he , c , n , o , s as a function of metallicity @xcite .    not all participants computed the stellar masses for both fields . in the end , we present 9 different sets of stellar masses for the goods - s field and 9 for the uds field .",
    "in addition to their preferred mass estimate , some of the teams also provided further results based on different assumptions .",
    "although we will not use these to compute the final stellar mass values , we present them in table [ tab : param3 ] in appendix [ app : additional ] , and we will use them to test how specific parameters affect the best - fit result in the next section .    all these stellar mass estimates are included as electronic tables on the online edition of this publication .",

    "this section discusses the overall agreement / disagreement and then the effects of the sfh and of including nebular emission . for a more detailed and systematic discussion about the uncertainties in the stellar mass estimates of different methods , we refer the reader to m15 .      because no `` true '' mass against which to compare all the others is available",
    ", we start by comparing each mass estimate with the median value .",
    "this median was computed for each galaxy by considering all sets of stellar masses after rescaling them to the same chabrier imf ( as this is the imf adopted by all but two of the teams ) : following @xcite , we subtract 0.24 dex from stellar masses computed assuming the salpeter imf . to deal with the low number of measurements available to compute the median , we adopt the hodges - lehmann estimator , defined as the median value of the means in the linear space of each pair of estimates in the sample : @xmath75 we used a bootstrap procedure ( with 10 times the number of measurements iterations ) to randomly choose the pairs @xmath76 and @xmath77 , rather than using all possible values .",
    "this statistical estimator has the robustness of an ordinary median but smaller uncertainty .",
    "we refer to this hodges - lehmann mean value as @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ fig : cfr_allm ] shows the ratio between each set of stellar masses and the median value as a function of the median . on average , the agreement among the different estimates is quite satisfactory , despite the different assumptions adopted .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the median value of the @xmath79 distribution was computed as @xmath80 , where @xmath11 is the standard deviation and @xmath81 is the number of objects one takes the median of , i.e. , the number of galaxies in the sample . for most of the stellar mass sets ,",
    "the majority of values are tightly clustered around the median of the distribution .",
    "we quantify the broadness of the distribution by means of the semi interquartile range ( siqr ) , defined as half the difference between the @xmath82 and the @xmath83 percentile . the typical siqr is lower than 0.1 dex for most estimates .",
    "we also quantify the importance of the tails of the @xmath84 distributions as the fraction of estimates differing from the median value by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the stellar mass estimates showing the largest deviations from the median ( siqr@xmath00.1 - 0.15 ) are those based on stellar templates other than bc03 ( methods 2d@xmath57 , 4b and 10c ) .",
    "bc03 templates , adopted by most of the teams , strongly constrain the median value . the same methods",
    "also show the largest fraction of objects in the tails of the distribution ( 1326% ) .",
    "two teams ( methods 4b and 10c ) have used stellar templates including a treatment of the tp - agb phase @xcite .",
    "the enhanced emission at near - ir wavelengths due to the contribution of tp - agb stars , especially for galaxies dominated by intermediate - age stellar populations ( @xmath01 gyr ) , forces an overall lower normalization , hence slightly smaller stellar masses ( e.g. , @xcite ; m15 ) .",
    "however , the scatter is larger than the offset ( see also @xcite for a comparison between bc03- and cb07-based results ) .",
    "methods 4b and 10c present other differences compared to the other teams .",
    "for example , method 10c is the only one that does not include extinction in the templates . with the aim of verifying whether the lack of extinction could be responsible for the large dispersion",
    ", we estimated the stellar mass by using the very same assumption as method 10c but allowing for dust extinction ( see method 10c@xmath85 presented in appendix [ app : additional ] ) .",
    "the siqr and the fraction of objects in the tails of the distribution are only very mildly reduced if not unchanged ( siqr @xmath8 0.09 and 0.08 and 15% and 12% of sources differ by more than a factor of 2 in gooods - s and uds , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that dust reddening alone can not explain the large scatter around the median value .",
    "both methods 4b and 10c assume different sfh shapes instead of simple @xmath48 models , adopted by 5 out of 10 teams .",
    "we will demonstrate in section  [ sec : sfh ] that stellar masses are stable against different parameterizations of the sfh ( at least those we could directly test ) .",
    "however , the tail of the @xmath86 distribution towards lower values disappears for method 10c when only galaxies best - fitted with direct-@xmath48 models are considered , and the fraction of sources differing from the median by more than a factor of 2 decreases to 8% and 11% in goods - s and uds , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the siqr is basically unchanged ( 0.09 and 0.11 dex in the two fields , respectively ) .",
    "method 4b shows a distribution with respect to the median value that is slightly bimodal .",
    "this is partly responsible for its broadness .",
    "this effect has already been reported by m15 , who ascribe it to parameter degeneracy combined with the adoption of different stellar templates and sfh with respect to the majority of other mass estimates .",
    "the degeneracy seems to cause the best solution to fluctuate between either a population of lower mass galaxies ( likely young and star - forming ) or alternatively a population of higher mass ones , in agreement with the median values .",
    "method 4b differs from most of the others also due to the inclusion of nebular emission .",
    "although we will demonstrate in section  [ sec : neb ] that nebular emission strongly affects stellar masses in only a subset of sources , it may increase the degeneracy when combined with some peculiar sfh parameterizations , e.g. , inverted-@xmath48 models used by method 4b .",
    "finally , methods 2d@xmath57 and 4b are based on a different choice of the imf .",
    "they were converted to a chabrier imf by multiplying the masses by a constant value ( i.e. , by subtracting 0.24 dex , see above ) , which is a good approximation .",
    "indeed , the fact that the median value of @xmath86 is close to zero for method 2d@xmath57 provides a further confirmation of the applicability of a constant shift . for method 4b the median",
    "is instead shifted to lower values .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the effect of inclusion of tp - agb stars and parameter degeneracy discussed above .",
    "anyway , the bulk of the galaxies are located reasonably close to zero , once again confirming the validity of the imf conversion .      to better investigate the effect of the assumed parameterization of the sfh",
    ", we take advantage of the additional mass estimates that were provided by several teams and that are presented in appendix [ app : additional ] .",
    "because these results are based on the very same assumptions as the mass estimates presented above except for the sfh parameterization , they allow us to isolate its effect on the mass estimates by leaving the other assumptions unchanged .    figure  [ fig : sfh ] shows a comparison between the stellar masses in the goods - s sample computed under the assumption of direct-@xmath48 , inverted-@xmath48 , delayed-@xmath48 models , linearly increasing and constant sfh .",
    "stellar masses computed assuming such different sfh parameterizations show a very good agreement with respect to direct-@xmath48 models , with narrow distributions ( siqr@xmath870.07 dex ) and no obvious offsets nor trends with stellar mass nor with redshift .",
    "the only notable feature is a group of sources having @xmath88 ( i.e. , the mass based on direct-@xmath48 models ) much larger ( by up to an order of magnitude ) than @xmath89 ( i.e. , the mass based on inverted-@xmath48 models , upper panels of figure  [ fig : sfh ] ) : these are galaxies which are old and massive according to the exponentially decreasing model fit , and young and low - mass when fitted with an exponentially increasing model .",
    "indeed , sources with @xmath90 have an average reddening e(b - v)@xmath00.5 as inferred from the fit with inverted-@xmath48 models , but e(b - v)@xmath710.1 when direct-@xmath48 models are adopted .",
    "on the other hand , sources above this threshold show similar reddening in both fits . in any case ,",
    "such discrepant sources represent only 10% of objects , the rest of the sample showing @xmath91 within a factor of 2 .",
    "our results are in agreement with the previous work of @xcite , who concluded that stellar masses are robust and on average unaffected by the choice of the sfh because of a combination of effects in the estimate of the galaxy star formation rates and ages .",
    "however , discrepant results were found by other groups @xcite , who reported an underestimation of the stellar mass when parameterizing the sfh as direct-@xmath48 models compared to the mass predicted by semi - analytical models . according to their analyses",
    ", the mismatch can be as much as 0.6 dex , with the exact value depending on stellar mass , redshift , and fitting setup .",
    "our analysis does not include sfhs with bursts .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the adoption of smooth , dust - free exponentially declining sfhs changes the stellar masses obtained with bursty models ( where bursts are added to direct-@xmath48 models ) by no more than 0.1 dex on average , and by less than a factor of 2 for individual galaxies ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "only three teams ( methods 4b , 11a@xmath57 and 14a ) have included nebular emission in the stellar templates .",
    "however , because these three sets of stellar masses differ from the others also because of other assumptions , it is not an easy task to isolate the effect of nebular emission on the output stellar masses . for this reason ,",
    "we take advantage from the results of method 6a@xmath92 presented in appendix [ app : additional ] , which differs from method 6a@xmath57 only due to the inclusion of nebular emission .",
    "the comparison between stellar masses estimated without ( @xmath93 ) and with ( @xmath94 ) nebular emission is shown in figure  [ fig : neb ] .",
    "no significant offset is observed , nor are there trends as a function of stellar mass or redshift .",
    "although the @xmath95 distribution is very wide , the semi interquartile range is 0.1 dex , and 80% of the sample is confined within 0.3 dex from zero , meaning that the effect of nebular emission on wide band photometry is weak for the bulk of the population ( see also g15 ) .",
    "however , there are some exceptions that are worth discussing here .",
    "the effect of nebular emission is slightly enhanced in particular redshift ranges , where strong nebular lines enter the near - ir filters , on which stellar mass is strongly dependent . moreover , this effect is stronger at high redshift , where line emission contributes in a more effective way to the light in broad - band filters due to wavelength stretching as a consequence of cosmological expansion . the three redshift ranges where this effect is most evident are the @xmath96 region , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 band observe the [ oii](3727 ) , h@xmath58(4861 ) and [ oiii](5007 ) , and h@xmath59(6563 ) lines , respectively , the @xmath97 region , where h@xmath58(4861 ) and [ oiii](5007 ) lines enter the @xmath32 band and [ oii](3727 ) line enters the @xmath31 band , and the @xmath98 region , where h@xmath58(4861 ) and [ oiii](5007 ) lines are responsible for flux enhancement in the 3.6@xmath18 m band .",
    "this is more clearly shown in figure  [ fig : histoneb ] , where we plot the distribution of @xmath99 in the @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 redshift windows compared to the distribution of the total sample .",
    "these redshift intervals show a positive tail in the distribution of @xmath95 due to misinterpretation of nebular line emission as stellar continuum , resulting in a larger normalization in the best - fit template , hence in a larger stellar mass estimate . in summary , the overestimate of the stellar mass when ignoring nebular emission at high redshift , as predicted by previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is enhanced in particular redshift ranges where strong lines enter the near - ir filters and does not affect most of the galaxy sample .",
    "in addition , although @xmath95 is on average distributed around zero for the bulk of the population , its overall distribution is asymmetric , with a tail towards higher values ( see shaded histogram in figure  [ fig : histoneb ] ) . because the spectra of young and star - forming galaxies are characterized by many ( and intense ) nebular emission lines , we expect that the effect of including or neglecting nebular emission may depend on the galaxy age .",
    "in fact , a well defined trend of @xmath95 can be observed as a function of age as inferred from the fit including the nebular contribution ( age@xmath100 , right panel of figure  [ fig : neb ] ) : stellar masses turn out to be severely overestimated ( by as much as an order of magnitude ) in young ( age@xmath100@xmath71100 myr ) galaxies if nebular emission is ignored .",
    "indeed , strong nebular lines in their spectra may mimic the balmer and 4000  breaks , resulting in these sources being fitted better by older , passive , and more massive templates ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to further explore this effect , we plot in figure  [ fig : dmdage ] the ratio between stellar masses ( @xmath99 ) as a function of the ratio of ages ( @xmath101 ) , and color - code symbols according to the ratio of their sfrs ( @xmath102 ) , where the superscript neb denotes the parameters inferred from the fit with templates including nebular emission",
    "the stellar mass ratio is strongly correlated with the age ratio as well as with the sfr ratio .",
    "as noted above , ignoring nebular emission produces an overestimate of the stellar mass in galaxies that are young and star - forming according to the fit with nebular emission , while the stellar mass is mostly unaffected when the best - fit age and sfr computed with and without the nebular contribution are consistent . in general , when comparing two distinct estimates of the stellar mass , the largest differences are observed in galaxies that have a young star - forming solution in one fit and an old passive solution in the other , as shown in figure  [ fig : dmdage ] . this behavior is common to every pair of fits and not specific to the case with / without nebular emission , as also discussed by m15 .",
    "finally , in order to understand how important is the particular implementation of nebular emission compared to including it at all , we compared the results of the four methods that include the nebular component , i.e. , methods 4b , 6a@xmath92 , 11a@xmath57 and 14a .",
    "more specifically , we compared each method with the median of the four , in a similar way as done in figure [ fig : cfr_allm ] , after rescaling all masses to the same chabrier imf .",
    "the methods accounting for nebular emission generally agree with each other better than they do with the methods not including it : the distributions of the ratio between each of the methods and their median has a siqr of 0.050.1 dex , with a fraction of @xmath103 of sources differing by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the only exception is method 4b .",
    "however , we ascribe its wider distribution to the different stellar isochrone models adopted by this method , as discussed in section [ sec : comp ] .    to summarize , figures [ fig : neb ] , [ fig : histoneb ] , and [ fig : dmdage ]",
    "show that 80% of the population is unaffected by the inclusion of nebular emission ( see also g15 ) , and @xmath104 is consistent with 0 . for these galaxies ,",
    "the inclusion of nebular emission does not change the stellar mass by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "however , nebular emission can strongly affect the light emitted by subclasses of galaxies , notably galaxies in particular redshift ranges ( especially at @xmath105 ) or young ( @xmath106myr ) sources .",
    "for extremely young ( @xmath107myr ) galaxies , ignoring nebular emission may produce an overestimate of the stellar mass by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "the sources whose difference in the stellar mass is larger than a factor of 6 ( i.e. , beyond the minimum shown by the histograms in figure [ fig : histoneb ] ) is 6% of the total sample .",
    "given the results shown in the previous sections , we can conclude that the stellar mass is a stable parameter against different assumptions in the fit for the majority of the galaxy population .",
    "except for the imf , which introduces a roughly constant offset , the most important assumption is the choice of the stellar population synthesis templates ( see also m15 ) , which seem to severely affect stellar mass estimates . because bc03 templates are assumed by most of the teams ( 7 out of 9 for the goods - s sample , 6 out of 9 for the uds sample ) , we decided to compute a median mass by only considering bc03-based estimates : in the goods - s field we consider stellar masses from methods 2a@xmath57 , 6a@xmath57 , 11a@xmath57 , 12a , 13a@xmath57 , 14a , 15a , while in the uds field we consider masses from methods 2a@xmath57 , 6a@xmath57 , 11a@xmath57 , 12a , 13a@xmath57 , 14a .",
    "as demonstrated by m15 , the median value provides the most accurate measure of the stellar mass , as long as the individual estimates are unbiased compared to each other , as is the case ( see previous section ) .",
    "because only a limited number of measurements are available , we adopted the hodges - lehmann estimator ( see equation [ eq : hlmean ] ) instead of the median , as explained in section  [ sec : comp ] , computed in linear space .",
    "we refer to this median value as @xmath108 and consider it the reference mass for the candels catalogs .",
    "we quantify the scatter around the median value caused by the different assumptions for computing stellar masses by means of the standard deviation ( @xmath109 ) of the various methods , again computed in linear space and only considering the methods adopting bc03 stellar templates .",
    "therefore , this scatter does not , by definition , account for the effect of stellar evolution modeling , such as for example the inclusion of the tp - agb phase , but it is mainly caused by differences in the technicalities in the mass computation , in the parameter grid sampling , in the assumed sfh , and in the prior assumptions . this scatter is roughly 25 - 35% of the median values and shows no trend with age nor with rest - frame colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : hmass ] shows candels reference stellar masses as a function of observed @xmath110 band magnitude , while figure  [ fig : zmass ] shows them as a function of redshift , in goods - s and uds .",
    "the right panels of both figures show a comparison between the two fields . in figure",
    "[ fig : zmass ] we cut both samples to @xmath111 to account for different observational depth in the two fields .",
    "the @xmath93@xmath110 and @xmath93@xmath45 relations agree very well in the two fields , confirming the consistency of the photometry , i.e. , meaning that there are no issues associated with colors or photometric redshifts .",
    "all the stellar mass estimates that we are considering and comparing in the present work are computed by assuming the photometric or spectroscopic redshift at their reported value , not accounting any redshift uncertainties . however , as shown by g15 when measuring galaxy stellar mass functions , the reliability of photometric redshift may represent the major source of uncertainty in the stellar mass estimate .",
    "moreover , the effect of model degeneracy ( i.e. , the possibility of having two or more different seds fitting the observations equally well because of the similar effects on broad - band colors due to varying sfh , age , metallicity , dust ) may be significant and should not be underestimated .",
    "this effect is reflected by the width of the probability distribution function pdf(@xmath93 ) .",
    "we estimate here the relative uncertainty on the stellar mass originating from the scatter in the photometric redshifts combined with model degeneracy and compare it with the systematic uncertainty caused by adoption of different assumptions ( but the same redshifts ) from the various teams .",
    "we quantify relative uncertainties as @xmath112 , where @xmath11 is the standard deviation of the mass distribution for each object .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates caused by different assumptions in the fit is indicated as @xmath113 . for each object",
    ", @xmath109 was calculated as explained in the previous section .",
    "the relative uncertainty derived from model degeneracy and uncertainties in the photometric redshift determination , denoted by @xmath114 , depends on the width of the redshift probability distributions function pdf(@xmath45 ) ( d13 ) and on photometric errors .",
    "it was estimated by means of a monte carlo simulation as explained by g15 .",
    "briefly , for each galaxy lacking a spectroscopic estimate , a random redshift was extracted according to its pdf(@xmath45 ) , and a pdf(@xmath93 ) was computed by fitting the observed photometry at the extracted redshift following method 6a@xmath57 . for spectroscopic sources , a single pdf(@xmath93 )",
    "was calculated by fixing the redshift to its spectroscopic value .",
    "a mass estimate was then extracted according to the pdf(@xmath93 ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated 10000 times for each object and a standard deviation ( @xmath115 ) and a mean value ( @xmath116 ) of the resulting mass distribution were computed in linear space .",
    "@xmath117 is included in the released mass catalogs .",
    "figure [ fig : scatter ] shows the ratio between the relative uncertainty due to model degeneracy and photometric redshifts scatter ( @xmath117 ) and that due to differing assumptions in the sed fitting ( @xmath118 ) , as a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "@xmath117 is on average larger than @xmath118 , at least for the bulk of the population , by a factor of @xmath02 .",
    "this factor increases for low - mass sources and is close to unity at high stellar masses .",
    "indeed , massive galaxies have more accurate photometry thanks to the higher s / n , hence have more accurate photometric redshifts and allow a lower level of model degeneracy in the fit .",
    "no trend is observed with redshift .",
    "the fact that the uncertainty due to the assumptions in the fit is on average smaller than that originating from models degeneracy and photo-@xmath45 scatter further justifies our choice of computing the median of estimates performed by the various teams , despite the different assumptions ( see table [ tab : param1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the value of @xmath117 in spectroscopic and photometric sources , in order to have an idea of the contribution of photometric redshift scatter compared to model degeneracy .",
    "the average @xmath117 is about two times larger for sources lacking good quality spectra compared to spectroscopic galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts scatter therefore makes the uncertainty in stellar masses worse by a factor of 2 , compared to what inevitably one gets due to model degeneracy .",
    "however , the spectroscopic sample is biased toward the brightest galaxies , which have the cleanest photometry and therefore suffer from the lowest level of model degeneracy in the fit .",
    "fainter galaxies are susceptible to a higher degeneracy .    in conclusion ,",
    "figure  [ fig : scatter ] illustrates that model degeneracy and photometric redshift scatter remain the largest source of uncertainty when estimating stellar masses : the relative mass uncertainty due to model degeneracy and photo-@xmath45 exceeds that due to other systematics ( assumptions and details in the fits and choice of the parameters grid ) by a factor of 2 for the bulk of the population , and potentially by factors of  several toward lower masses . only for the most massive galaxies",
    "is the contribution of model degeneracy associated with photo-@xmath45 scatter comparable to that of systematics in the mass computation .",
    "we compare candels reference stellar masses with those released by the 3d - hst team for the same fields @xcite , by matching the two catalogs in position with a tolerance of 0.1 arcsec .",
    "they use bc03 templates , assume a chabrier imf , direct-@xmath48 model sfhs with a minimum timescale @xmath119 of 7 , solar metallicity , a minimum @xmath120 , a calzetti extinction law with 0.0@xmath71e(b - v)@xmath711.0 , and do not include nebular emission . because their masses are computed on different photometric catalogs and hence assuming different photometric redshifts , we only consider those sources whose redshifts differ by less than 0.1 .",
    "the requirement that positions and redshifts are within the tolerance leaves us with @xmath121 of the candels sample .",
    "the comparison , as a function of both candels median masses and redshifts , is shown in figure  [ fig:3dhst ] .",
    "the comparison is satisfying at a first - order glance , with quite narrow dispersion ( siqr @xmath122 dex ) , increasing towards high redshifts , where sources are generally fainter and photometry is noisier .",
    "however , a slight negative median offset ( @xmath0@xmath123 dex ) in both fields and a curved trend in uds are observed . these effects could be ascribed to systematics in the sed fitting , in particular affecting 3d - hst results .",
    "indeed , while 3d - hst stellar masses result from a single fit , candels stellar masses are computed with a median approach , which is able to wash out systematic biases affecting specific assumptions in the sed modelling and was demonstrated to provide a more robust measure ( m15 ) .",
    "to check whether this may be the cause , we compare 3d - hst masses with the mass estimate within candels whose method and assumptions are closest 3d - hst ones , i.e. method 2a@xmath57 .",
    "the offset is reduced ( median @xmath124 in goods - s and median @xmath125 in uds ) , but the curved trend is mostly unchanged .",
    "the residual offset observed in the uds field and the curved trend may be due to systematics in the photometry .",
    "indeed , uds , having data of poorer quality , might be more susceptible to biases compared to the better quality data in goods - s .",
    "the difference between candels and 3d - hst stellar mass estimates ( siqr @xmath122 dex ) is only slightly larger than the typical dispersion observed among different estimates within candels assuming the same stellar models .",
    "however , the distributions are overall more extended : the fraction of objects differing by more than a factor of 2 is 11% and 15% in goods - s and uds , respectively . if the distributions are shifted so that the average offset is zero , these fractions are marginally reduced ( 10% ) .",
    "they are equal to 12% and 11% if 3d - hst masses are compared to method 2a@xmath57 instead of the median candels masses , reflecting an intrinsic larger distribution due to differences in the photometry and in the redshifts in addition to the systematics in the mass estimates .",
    "the median approach has revealed a powerful tool to overcome systematics associated with the choice of the sed fitting parameters ( see previous section and m15 ) .",
    "for this reason , the catalogs presented here include the candels reference median mass ( @xmath126 ) as well as the median of only the methods including nebular emission ( and based on the same stellar isochrone library , i.e. , methods 6a@xmath127 , 11a@xmath57 and 14a ) , in both cases with their associated scatters ( see section [ sec : median ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the catalogs also contain each individual estimate of the stellar mass for each source ( tables [ tab : param1 ] and [ tab : param3 ] ) .",
    "the various sets of stellar mass measurements agree on average , at least those based on the same stellar templates . however , the different assumptions , such as the sfh parameterization or the inclusion of nebular emission , may produce very different results for few peculiar and interesting objects or for subsets of very young galaxies ( see for example figure  [ fig : neb ] ) . the comparison of the various methods may then provide interesting information and a deeper insight in the galaxy evolution paradigm .",
    "in addition to the stellar masses , we also include in a separate file other physical parameters ( such as age , sfr , metallicity , dust reddening , etc ) and rest - frame magnitudes as estimated from the various methods .",
    "the same file also incorporates the uncertainties in the stellar masses , neglecting redshift errors , associated with methods 6a@xmath57 , 11a@xmath57 and 12a .",
    "both files for each field are released as electronic tables in the online version of the journal and are uploaded on the stsci mast archive website for candels .",
    "tables showing the list of columns in each catalog are reported in appendix [ app : masscat ] .",
    "the catalogs are also available in the rainbow database @xcite , which features a query menu that allows users to search for individual galaxies , create subsets of the complete sample based on different criteria , and inspect cutouts of the galaxies in any of the available bands .",
    "it also includes a crossmatching tool to compare against user uploaded catalogs .",
    "this paper accompanies the public release of the candels mass catalogs for the goods - s and uds fields .",
    "we present and make publicly available the reference candels stellar masses obtained by combining the results from various teams within the collaboration .",
    "masses are estimated adopting the official candels photometry and assuming spectroscopic redshifts when available , or the official candels photometric redshifts ( dahlen et al . in prep . ) otherwise .",
    "we also release the individual stellar mass estimates computed by each team , as their comparison may be useful especially when studying peculiar objects , as well as other physical parameters ( such as age , sfr , metallicity , dust reddening , etc ) and rest - frame magnitudes associated with the sed fitting .",
    "the availability of several mass estimates has allowed us to compare methods , from which we conclude the following :    * the results from the various teams are in overall good agreement despite the different methods , assumptions , and priors . *",
    "the parameter which has the greatest effect on the stellar mass is the stellar isochrone library : due to different modeling of several stellar evolutionary phases , such as the tp - agb phase , the adoption of different libraries produces a dispersion ( in terms of the semi interquartile range ) larger than 0.1 dex , while the dispersion shown by estimates based on the same stellar templates is on average smaller . *",
    "stellar masses are stable against the choice of the sfh parameterization and differences in the metallicity / extinction / age parameter grid sampling . *",
    "the imf only affects stellar masses as an overall scaling , as expected . *",
    "the inclusion of nebular emission can have a large effect but only on a small fraction of the sample . specifically , ignoring nebular emission in the model spectra may cause an overestimate of the stellar mass in galaxies that are either young ( @xmath1myr ) or lie in particular redshift ranges , especially at high redshift .",
    "indeed , in these redshift windows strong nebular lines enter the near - ir filters , on which stellar mass is strongly dependent .",
    "the overestimate can exceed a factor of 10 in extremely young ( @xmath5myr ) galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of nebular emission is negligible for the majority ( 80% ) of galaxies .",
    "as current and future surveys push observations towards the youngest universe , it becomes crucial to investigate whether the assumptions adopted to include nebular emission in the models are correct , in order to infer the most reliable stellar masses for the first galaxies .",
    "based on these results , we combined all mass estimates assuming the same stellar templates and imf by means of the hodges - lehmann estimator . the standard deviation among different methods is a measure of the systematic uncertainties affecting stellar masses due to the choice of the assumptions and priors adopted in the fit and parameter grid sampling .",
    "such systematics are smaller , by a factor of 2 on average , than the uncertainty due to model degeneracy and scatter in photometric redshifts . among these ,",
    "the latter dominate over model degeneracy .",
    "however , this can only be tested in sources with robust , spectroscopic redshifts , and at the same time model degeneracies are expected to become more important for faint galaxies ( lacking spectroscopic observations ) due to the larger photometric errors .    finally , we compare candels stellar masses with those released by the 3d - hst team .",
    "the agreement is satisfying at a first - order glance , but we observe a negative median offset ( @xmath0 - 0.1dex ) in both fields and a curved trend in uds .",
    "the offset disappears in goods - s and is reduced in uds when 3d - hst results are compared with the method adopting the closest assumptions to the 3d - hst team . while we can not say whether or not any one technique is biased , our tests with mock catalogs in m15 suggests that the median mass is less susceptible to modeling uncertainties than the results from any one code .",
    "the different behavior of goods - s and uds in the comparison to 3d - hst also illustrates that differences in photometric quality ( number of filters and s / n ) can affect not only the scatter but also the biases between methods ( the poorer quality dataset available in uds compared to the more accurate photometry in goods - s is more susceptible to biases ) . in any case",
    ", we show that the larger fraction of objects in the tails of the @xmath128 distributions are at least partially explained by differences in the photometric and redshift catalogs .",
