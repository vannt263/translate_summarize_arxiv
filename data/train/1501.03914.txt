    "during the past two decades considerable progress has been made to characterize the pure and mixed states and their entanglement with multifaceted applications in the field of quantum computation and information @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental tasks in quantum information theory is to detect entanglement in quantum states . in general ,",
    "an entanglement can be identified from the separability criterion .",
    "several necessary and/or sufficient separability criteria have been proposed in the literature in order to capture the entanglement of bipartite states @xcite . among these criteria ,",
    "the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) plays a vital role in detecting entanglement in @xmath1 and @xmath2 bipartite states @xcite .",
    "the separability criterion in terms of the range of density matrix and the computable cross - norm criterion ( ccnr ) work efficiently for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mixed states whereas ppt fails to detect entanglement in these states @xcite .",
    "various approaches to construct bell inequalities were also proposed for pure two qudit systems @xcite and higher dimensional bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization criterion and bell - type inequalities are put forward for the separability of @xmath5 and @xmath6 bipartite states in refs.@xcite .",
    "a class of @xmath7 bipartite ppt states were proposed in @xcite in connection with the indecomposability of positive maps .",
    "however , a strong separability criteria is yet to be proposed for arbitrary dimensional bipartite states .    in the study of entanglement of bipartite states ,",
    "a few works have been devoted to analyze the entanglement with the help of non - hermitian operators .",
    "for example , tth et al .",
    "have derived an inequality to detect entanglement in two - mode continuous systems using number operator and mode annihilation operator @xcite .",
    "shchukin and vogel have derived general entanglement conditions for continuous bipartite states @xcite .",
    "subsequently , hillery and zubairy have developed certain entanglement conditions for two - mode systems by considering mode creation and annihilation operators @xcite . in a later work @xcite",
    "the same authors were given a wide range of applications of the entanglement conditions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these conditions were further strengthened to detect entanglement not just between field modes but also between atom and field modes or between groups of atoms , see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition to the above , non - hermitian operators were also employed to demonstrate the entanglement in multipartite states @xcite .",
    "the above studies reveal that non - hermitian operators can also be utilized to characterize the quantum states in a new way .    in this paper",
    ", we detect entanglement with the help of non - hermitian operators .",
    "the aim of this work is to derive a separability criterion in terms of expectation values of non - hermitian operators and their products for the higher dimensional bipartite states . to achieve this goal",
    ", we construct a qudit density matrix , whose elements are replaced by the expectation values of non - hermitian operators and their products .",
    "we then derive the same form of matrix for bipartite states by implementing a tensor product between expectation value matrices of two qudit states .",
    "our analysis shows that higher dimensional states can easily be represented in terms of non - hermitian operators .",
    "we then show that any expression which involves matrix elements can be reformulated by the expectation values of these non - hermitian operators and vice versa . to demonstrate this , we rewrite the condition of pure states , tr@xmath8@xmath9 , in terms of expectation values of non - hermitian operators and their products .",
    "we then consider the condition of pure product state and reformulate it in terms of density matrix elements from the expectation value of non - hermitian operators .",
    "we also present an operational form of partial transposition operation .",
    "proceeding further , we formulate a separability condition to the mixed bipartite states in terms of density matrix elements using the fact that they can be rewritten in terms of expectation values .",
    "to derive separability criterion for higher dimensional bipartite states , we consider @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the non - hermitian operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 act on first and second subsystem respectively , from which we find the necessary elements which are suitable for the werner - like states and isotropic like states @xcite .",
    "we then use the relation of these elements with diagonal elements in the density matrix @xcite and obtain a condition for entanglement of @xmath0 bipartite states in the form of an inequality .",
    "we also demonstrate the validity of our formulation by considering four different states .",
    "we organize our work as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we construct a density matrix for @xmath5 bipartite states whose elements are in the form of expectation values of certain non - hermitian operators and their products . in sect.[sec3 ] we show the utilization of expectation value matrix for few simple cases .",
    "we then derive the separability condition for @xmath0 bipartite states in sect.[sec4 ] and demonstrate the applicability of our method by considering four different states in sect.[sec5 ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusion in sect.[sec6 ] .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the states of two subsystems on the hilbert space @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the state of the composite system is then @xmath18 .",
    "it is known that any separable state can be expressed in the form @xcite .",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for pure and mixed state respectively .",
    "the density matrix representation of a qudit state is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 in which @xmath24 represents the dimension of the state and @xmath25 denotes the subsystem .",
    "let us consider certain non - hermitian operators , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 which act on @xmath30 , are of the form @xcite @xmath31 we observe that every element in the density matrix ( [ 3a ] ) can be expressed by the expectation value of the above non - hermitian operators and their products .",
    "for example , @xmath32 and so on . in terms of these non - hermitian operators ( @xmath26 s )",
    "the matrix ( [ 3a ] ) reads    @xmath33    the matrix representation of a bipartite state in terms of the expectation value of the operators ( [ 3 ] ) can be constructed by making the tensor product between expectation value matrices of first and second subsystems , that is @xmath34 expanding ( [ 3c ] ) we get @xmath35 equation ( [ 3d ] ) is an equivalent representation of the density matrix of an @xmath5 bipartite state , that is @xmath36    comparing the matrix elements in ( [ 3d ] ) with ( [ rho ] ) we observe that @xmath37 @xmath38 yields @xmath39 , @xmath40 yields @xmath41 and so on . in other words ,",
    "all the elements in the density matrix of bipartite states can now be represented by the expectation values of non - hermitian operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 and their products . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a bell state , @xmath44 and its density operator @xmath45 . by using the ideas given above one",
    "can get @xmath46 by computing @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 from the expectation values @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively and @xmath52 by evaluating @xmath53 thus one can unambiguously represent every element in the density matrix by the expectation value of non - hermitian operators and their products .",
    "in fact , with the aid of matrix ( [ 3d ] ) one can extract the value of any element of an arbitrary bipartite state .",
    "one can also construct this type of matrix for multipartite states .",
    "however , in this paper we confine our attention only on bipartite states .",
    "we mention here that one can easily obtain the reduced density matrix from equation ( [ 3c ] ) instead of taking partial trace .",
    "it can be simply obtained by calculating all the expectation values present in any one of the susbsytems in ( [ 3c ] ) , which is required .",
    "to demonstrate that any expression which involves matrix elements can be reformulated by expectation values of operators , we write tr@xmath8 in terms of matrix elements for an arbitrary dimensional bipartite states .",
    "we then rewrite this expression in terms of expectatin values of operators .",
    "we reformulate the condition for pure product state from the expectation value of non - hermitian operators into density matrix elements .",
    "in addition to the above , we present an operational form of partial transposition by employing the operators present in ( [ 3c ] ) .",
    "let us recall the condition @xmath55 for pure states , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the dimensions of the first and second subsystem respectively .",
    "equation ( [ 31 ] ) can now be expressed solely in terms of the expectation values of non - hermitian operators by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) with ( [ rho ] ) . replacing the elements by their expectation values of non - hermitian operators @xmath26 and @xmath59 and their products",
    "suitably we find    @xmath60    @xmath61    the above expression is the general form of tr@xmath8 for an arbitrary bipartite states .      in the case of",
    "pure separable states the expectation value of a joint measurement of two operators should be equal to the product of expectation value of individual measurement of the same operators acting on the bipartite state , that is @xmath62 .",
    "considering the operators that appear in the diagonal in ( [ 3d ] ) and imposing the pure separability condition given above and comparing it with ( [ rho ] ) , we can express the criterion of pure separable states in terms of density matrix elements . in the case of @xmath63 pure product state",
    "the condition reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 ,  @xmath67 and @xmath68 iff @xmath69 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 can be determined by simply fixing the @xmath70 value for @xmath25 in the interval @xmath65 . with the known value of @xmath70",
    "one can proceed to check the separability in pure arbitrary bipartite states .    if the given state does not satisfy the condition ( [ rhokk ] ) then it should be a pure entangled one .      in the following , we point out how we can reformulate the partial transposition in terms of non - hermitian operators and their products .",
    "to begin with , we consider a two qubit case and express the partial transposition operation . in this case , we find @xmath71 we can rewrite the above two expressions as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 represent the partial transposition with respect to first and second subsystem respectively .",
    "we note here that the operators appearing in the expressions ( [ rph2q1 ] ) and ( [ rph2q2 ] ) are taken from the expectation value matrix @xmath54 ( [ 3c ] ) ( restricted to @xmath75 ) . in other words , we have considered all the operators in the first and second subsystems .",
    "equation ( [ rph2qk ] ) can be generalized to an arbitrary bipartite state by considering all the operators present in the corresponding expectation value matrix ( [ 3c ] ) , that is ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to the transposition ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 corresponds to the subsystem @xmath25 .",
    "eq.([ptd ] ) is an operational form of partial transposition .",
    "if the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath78 are positive then the underlying state is separable in view of ppt criterion @xcite .",
    "in refs.@xcite the biseparability and full separability criteria for @xmath79-partite quantum states using elements of density matrices were derived . in this work ,",
    "we derive a separability criterion applicable to @xmath80 bipartite states using the ideas given in the references @xcite . to begin with",
    ", we consider a pure two qubit separable state @xmath81 . for this state , we have @xmath82 or @xmath83 and @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "the first two expressions yield @xmath86 using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric mean , the above expression can be rewritten as @xmath87 similarly , for the element @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 from these two expressions , ( [ rho14 ] ) and ( [ rho23 ] ) , we can extract the following condition @xmath90 one may also come across this type of inequalities in the partially separable multiqubit states @xcite .    now we generalize the above condition to @xmath0 bipartite states . in the two qubit case , we have derived the separability condition using the elements @xmath91 and @xmath88 . in the higher dimensional case",
    ", we have a difficulty with which elements are to be measured . to choose the relevant elements , we consider expectation value of joint measurement opertors @xmath92 and its partially transposed and conjugated operator @xmath93 .",
    "we note here that to extract the required elements , we consider only @xmath10 and @xmath11 which in turn provide non - zero off diagonal elements in werner and isotropic classes of states @xcite .    before demonstrating how to extract the required elements by substituting the non - hermitian operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we justify the proposed expectation values , that is @xmath10 and @xmath11 , by considering two qubit states . substituting the non - hermitian operator @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and comparing the matrix ( [ 3d ] ) with ( [ rho ] ) , we can prove that the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 give the matrix elements @xmath91 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "one may note that only these two elements appear in the entanglement condition ( [ 1423 ] ) . with this verification now we proceed to construct separability condition for the higher dimensional states .    to begin with",
    ", we constitute the separability condition for the two qutrit state .",
    "we then generalize it to the two qudit states .",
    "in the two qutrit @xmath96 separable case , we consider non - hermitian operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 are of the form @xmath97 and @xmath98 which are the possible operators in @xmath99 bases . considering @xmath95 and substituting @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath10 and comparing the matrix ( [ 3d ] ) with ( [ rho ] ) , we find that @xmath10 produces the matrix elements @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the present case ,",
    "the underlying inequalities read @xmath105 adding and simplifying the above expressions , we get @xmath106 repeating the above analysis for the case @xmath11 we end up with the following inequality , namely @xmath107 combining the equations ( [ tqt1 ] ) and ( [ tqt2 ] ) suitably we obtain the separability condition for the two qutrit states in the form @xmath108    now we generalize the above conditions to the two qudit states . substituting the non - hermitian operators",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 ,  , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ,  , @xmath113 ,  , and @xmath114 , which are in the @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ,  , @xmath118 bases , in the above expectation values of operators and following the procedure given above , we arrive at @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents the density matrix element in @xmath121 row and @xmath122 column and @xmath24 represents the dimension of a qudit state in @xmath0 bipartite states .",
    "using some simple algebras and cauchy inequality we can extend the condition ( [ cond ] ) to mixed bipartite states as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ cond ] ) holds for mixed separable states and violation of this inequality implies that the state is entangled . as we have seen in sect.[sec3 ] , any expression involves density matrix elements can be reformulated by the expectation values given in ( [ 3d ] ) .",
    "therefore , the experimental accessibility of the criterion ( [ cond ] ) also becomes possible @xcite .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the above ideas by considering various mixed states . + 1 . we consider a @xmath123 werner state parametrized by @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "@xmath125 where @xmath126 is the identity operator , @xmath127 is the flip operator , @xmath24 is the dimension and @xmath128 . for @xmath129 , it becomes a separable state .",
    "werner states are entangled for @xmath130 @xcite . to identify the entangled regions of the above @xmath7 werner states for various @xmath24 values , we derive the following general function , @xmath131 \\notag\\\\ & \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^d ( d - i)\\right)\\times \\frac{\\eta}{(d-1)d}}\\right ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by applying the inequality ( [ cond ] ) on ( [ wer ] ) .",
    "we plot the outcome in fig.1(a ) . for a given dimension ,",
    "the value of this function is less than one , that is @xmath132 , then the state is entangled .",
    "we also employ this function to study the higher dimensional werner states ( not included in figure ) .",
