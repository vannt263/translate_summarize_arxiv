    "simple spin models have contributed significantly to our understanding of quantum magnetism .",
    "they consist of mutually interacting spin-@xmath5 objects arranged in a lattice and are meant to describe the behavior of localized electrons in a crystalline environment .",
    "such models are generally viewed as effective , low - energy descriptions , descended from their electronic parent models by a process of integrating out the gapped charge degrees of freedom.@xcite    a tremendous variety of spin interactions can arise .",
    "in particular , a `` @xmath6''-style power series from the strong correlation limit generates ( or at least motivates ) an increasingly complicated zoo of multi - spin interaction terms.@xcite nonetheless , we know that even the leading order term in the expansion , corresponding to heisenberg models with just two - spin interactions , can display highly nontrivial physics if the exchange interactions are sufficiently frustrating.@xcite in that case , the ground state may be a magnetically disordered , spin - rotation - invariant state ",
    "either liquid@xcite or solid@xcite  having no classical .",
    "otherwise , conventional magnetic order ( at some ordering vector @xmath7 ) is a generic feature of the ground state for heisenberg models in spatial dimension greater than one.@xcite the absence of frustration is connected to three inter - related properties : ( i ) the existence of a bipartite such that all antiferromagnetic interactions connect sites in opposite sublattices , ( ii ) strict adherence to a marshall sign rule,@xcite and ( iii ) the possibility of transforming mechanistically to a basis in which all amplitudes of the wave function are real and nonnegative .",
    "the last of these is why nonfrustrated models can be easily simulated using quantum monte carlo approaches .",
    "@xcite    for the @xmath8 case , all three properties are conceptually unified in the language of _ valence bonds_.@xcite the collinear , @xmath7-ordered ground state of a nonfrustrated heisenberg model can be described in a bipartite valence bond basis@xcite in which the ab sublattice coincides with the alternating pattern laid out by @xmath7 and only spins in opposite sublattices are bound into singlet pairs . in terms of such a basis @xmath9",
    ", the ground state has an expansion @xmath10 in which each amplitude @xmath11 is real and nonnegative .",
    "the exact amplitudes can be obtained numerically by projection.@xcite    it is also possible to find extremely good approximate values of the form @xmath12\\in v } h(\\mathbf{r}_{ij})$ ] , where @xmath13 is a function of the vector connecting bond endpoints .",
    "this resonating valence bond ( rvb ) ansatz , due to liang , doucot , and anderson , @xcite strictly enforces the geometric tiling constraint on the singlet bonds but ignores additional bond - bond correlations.@xcite for a magnetically ordered state , one can show that factorizability into individual bond amplitudes is the correct assumption.@xcite moreover , for nonfrustrated systems , the amplitudes exhibit power - law decay , and hence the wave function contains bonds on all length scales .    as a specific and illustrative example",
    ", we consider the square - lattice @xmath14@xmath1 model for spin half .",
    "it has two nonfrustrated limits . the model with anitferromagnetic nearest- interactions",
    "only ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) exhibits a nel ordered ground state whose staggered moment is roughly 60% of its fully polarized , classical value .",
    "the state is almost perfectly captured by an rvb wave function whose bond amplitudes are computed as @xmath17/\\gamma_{\\mathbf{q}}$ ] . here , @xmath18 , and the wave - vector sum",
    "is taken over a brillouin zone reduced with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the opposite limit , with _",
    "next_-nearest- interactions dominating ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , is equivalent to two interpenetrating nearest- heisenberg antiferromagnets rotated @xmath22 . the spin directions in the two otherwise disjoint subsystems lock to each other@xcite provided that @xmath14 is not strictly zero .",
    "in this case , the ground state is equally well described by the rvb wave function , but with the substitution of @xmath23 and a brillouin zone defined modulo @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "what we present in this paper is an attempt to interpolate between these two limits  through the entire range of relative couplings that are highly frustrated  using the rvb state as a variational wave function .",
    "our approach is inspired by ref .  , but there are several important differences .",
    "the first is simply the scale of the calculation : we have simulated a large number of lattice sizes up to @xmath26 on a dense grid of relative coupling values ( @xmath27 ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of @xmath28 ) .",
    "second , we do not require that @xmath29 respect the full @xmath30 symmetry of the square lattice .",
    "rather , we impose only the @xmath31- and @xmath32-axis reflection symmetry , giving the amplitudes an opportunity either to acquire ( over the course of the energy optimization ) the full symmetry or to settle into a state that looks different under @xmath33 rotation .",
    "third , we explore the space of ab sublattice s by which the bipartite valence bond basis is constructed .    as in ref .",
    ", we make use of an unbiased , stochastic optimization scheme .",
    "changes to the @xmath29 values are made in the downhill direction of the local energy gradient .",
    "step sizes are randomized , and their magnitude decreases on a power - law schedule . we do not attempt to guide the optimization , other than to ensure that none of the bond amplitudes goes negative ; nor do we impose any constraints on the variational parameters based on any prior knowledge ( gleaned , e.g. , from mean - field theory@xcite or from a master - equation analysis@xcite ) .",
    "we discover the following . at this level of approximation",
    ", the @xmath14@xmath1 model does indeed support a magnetically disordered intermediate phase .",
    "but its width is much smaller than expected : the phase boundaries are found to be at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the transitions are unambiguously second- and first - order , respectively , with the ground state achieving the full @xmath30 symmetry for all @xmath36 .",
    "as the system is tuned up from @xmath37 , increasing frustration eventually extinguishes the @xmath3 ordered moment at @xmath38 in a continuous fashion .    the disappearance of magnetic order is preceded by a failure of the marshall sign rule at @xmath39 , in agreement with the scenario first outlined by richter and co - workers.@xcite still , even though the rule is not strictly obeyed beyond @xmath40 , the marshall structure inherited from the @xmath37 model remains largely intact throughout the intermediate phase .",
    "this is true in the sense that continuing to define the bipartite bond basis from a _ checkerboard _ sublattice decomposition produces only a microscopic number of negative @xmath29 values  only @xmath41 and @xmath42 initially .",
    "moreover , when we allow the ab pattern to arise on its own within the simulation ( described in detail in secs .",
    "[ sect : dynamic ] and [ sect : results ] ) , the checkerboard pattern is the one selected whenever @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , the rvb state at large @xmath43 explicitly breaks the @xmath44 rotation symmetry and has a marshall sign structure based on a _ stripe _ sublattice decomposition . as the coupling is tuned down from the @xmath45 limit , the @xmath4 ordered moment is not strongly affected , and it persists with only weak variation ( never dropping below 47% of its fully polarized value ) down to @xmath46 , where the spatially symmetric , checkerboard - based rvb wave function takes over as the lowest energy state .",
    "this state in the region @xmath47 is , as far as we can tell , featureless .",
    "it exhibits no long - range spin or dimer order , and it breaks no symmetries .",
    "it is not , however , a `` short - range rvb state '' in the usual sense , since it is not made up of predominantly short bonds .",
    "its amplitude function @xmath29 is highly anisotropic ( as anticipated elsewhere@xcite ) and remains long ranged along the principal spatial axes .",
    "spin correlations appear to be critical and to display circular symmetry at long distances , despite the anisotropy of the bond weights .",
    "dimer correlations decay either exponentially or with a high power law .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the usual short - bond - only rvb state , often referred to as the nearest- rvb ( nnrvb ) , which has spin correlations that decay exponentially  @xcite and dimer correlations that decay algebraically.@xcite moreover , the presence of long bonds implies an absence of the topological order@xcite that is characteristic of a purely short - range rvb state in two dimensions .",
    "the spin - half , square - lattice heisenberg model with frustrating interactions has a hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings .",
    "the summations range over pairs of adjacent sites @xmath51 and over farther pairs @xmath52 that sit diagonally across a plaquette .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 is the key tuning parameter at zero temperature . in the classical version of this model ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "two magnetic phases meet at exactly @xmath54 , separated by a first - order transition.@xcite    in the @xmath8 problem , the two magnetically ordered ground states obtain for values @xmath55 and @xmath56,@xcite and a magnetically disordered phase intervenes .",
    "( there is , however , a good deal of disagreement over the exact positions of the critical points ; cf .  refs .   and , which put the lower critical point as low as 0.35 and as high as 0.45 . ) the physics of the phase in the intermediate region is not known with complete certainty , but it is commonly believed to be short ranged and not to exhibit any kind of conventional magnetic order .",
    "one possibility is a crystalline arrangement of valence bonds , a state with broken translational symmetry in which singlet formation s an enlargement of the unit cell beyond that of the underlying square lattice.@xcite a featureless spin liquid that does not break any symmetries is another possibility.@xcite    the case for a spin liquid ground state has been advanced by recent tensor product@xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite calculations and by a variational approach based on the entangled - plaquette ansatz.@xcite with regard to the dmrg result , sandvik has suggested that the use of a cylindrical geometry complicates the detection of crystalline order.@xcite his numerical experiments seem to indicate that the mixture of open and closed boundary conditions significantly raises the crossover length scale @xmath57 beyond which bond order takes hold ( i.e. , where the finite size scaling of the dimer - dimer correlations is truly in the asymptotic regime ) .",
    "such questions are difficult to resolve . unlike in three - dimensional systems , where crystalline bond order , if it is present , is almost always strong,@xcite in two dimensions it is quite delicate and can easily be disguised by a @xmath58 effective symmetry for system sizes @xmath59 .",
    "( see sects .",
    "iii and iv of ref .   and references therein . ) here , we attempt to make the best of this unsatisfactory state of affairs .",
    "we simply take the point of view that , for the lattice sizes ( up to @xmath26 ) we can simulate , the liquid and the weakly ordered bond crystal are indistinguishable .      in quantum heisenberg models , competing interactions that frustrate the order",
    "have the potential to stabilize exotic quantum phases , but they also render the problem computationally intractable on large lattices .",
    "frustrating interactions of even infinitesimal strength cause a sign problem@xcite that makes quantum monte carlo calculations unfeasible .",
    "moreover , the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with system size and is thus beyond the capability of exact diagonalization calculations if we want to get near the thermodynamic limit .",
    "( the record for spin half has recently jumped from 42 sites@xcite to 48 sites,@xcite a terribly impressive technical feat that nonetheless limits us to two - dimensional length scales @xmath60 that are quite small . )",
    "an approximate method based on good trial wave functions is therefore one of the few remaining possibilities for large systems .",
    "we consider a lattice of @xmath61 spins and a factorizable rvb wave function of the form @xmath62 \\in v } h(\\mathbf{r}_{ij } ) \\lvert v \\rangle,\\ ] ] where the sum is over all partitions of the lattice into @xmath63 directed pairs @xmath64 , [ i_2,j_2 ] , \\ldots , [ i_n , j_n ] ) $ ] . to every such _ dimer covering _",
    "@xmath65 , there is a corresponding singlet product state ; e.g. , @xmath66 \\in v } \\bigl ( \\lvert \\uparrow_{i } \\downarrow_{j } \\rangle - \\lvert \\downarrow_{i } \\uparrow_{j } \\rangle \\bigr)\\ ] ] in the @xmath8 case .",
    "the set @xmath67 of all possible singlet product states is both overcomplete and nonorthogonal and constitutes the so - called valence bond basis .",
    "we can now break up the lattice into two sublattices  groups of sites a and b , equal in number  and restrict ourselves to a reduced basis in which valence bonds connect only sites in opposite sublattices ( i.e. , @xmath68 , rather than @xmath69 ) .",
    "we adopt the convention that each bond @xmath70 $ ] is arranged with site @xmath71 in sublattice a and site @xmath72 in sublattice b. this has the advantage of rendering the overlap strictly positive : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of loops in the double dimer covering @xmath75 .",
    "( in this `` bosonic '' convention , the singlets are ab directed bonds . in the complementary `` fermionic '' convention ,",
    "the bonds are directionless and all signs are moved into the overlaps.@xcite )    to start , we consider two families of trial state , each built using a bipartite bond basis consistent with one of two static choices of sublattice , viz . , the checkerboard and stripe patterns shown in fig .  [ fig : patterns ] . later in the paper , we go on to describe a procedure in which the trial state is built using an unrestricted bond basis and the sublattice ( and hence the marshall sign convention ) is determined dynamically .",
    "the rvb wave function is quite expressive .",
    "its degrees of freedom are the full set of @xmath29 values with the bond vector @xmath76 spanning all lengths and orientations that can be achieved on an @xmath77 cluster with periodic boundary conditions and that are unique up to whatever symmetries are enforced .",
    "( still , the total number of parameters grows only linearly with the number of spins , which is radically slower than the number of states in the total spin singlet sector . )",
    "previous calculations of this kind@xcite considered only the checkerboard ab pattern and imposed on @xmath78 the full symmetry of the lattice , such that @xmath79 . in this calculation",
    ", we impose a less restrictive condition , @xmath80 , that respects reflection symmetry across the lines @xmath81 and @xmath82 but not across the lines @xmath83 . for the checkerboard pattern ,",
    "the number of free parameters is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 distinguishes between @xmath86 even and odd . for the stripe pattern ,",
    "the count is only slightly higher : @xmath87 .",
    "to recapitulate , our work involves a basis choice .",
    "we do not construct the trial wave functions from the largest possible set of valence bond states in which the spins are joined in all possible ways .",
    "instead , we obtain a more restricted basis by dividing the system into two groups of sites ( a and b ) and keeping only states in which bonds connect a sites and b sites ( bipartite bonds ) .",
    "no approximation is involved in this basis choice since the restricted basis is so massively overcomplete that even this subset still spans the relevant part of the hilbert space .",
    "but in assigning a and b labels to the sites , we are making a choice about the form of the trial wave function . by working with the checkerboard and stripe ab patterns , we are in essence adapting the trial wave function to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , and taking advantage of the marshall sign rules that exist in those two limits .",
    "we are not biasing the wave function , however , at least not in the sense that we are building in magnetic order .",
    "the wave functions constructed from either ab pattern are fully capable of representing nonmagnetic states .",

    "wherein two a - site or b - site bond endpoints sitting diagonally across a plaquette are swapped using metropolis sampling .",
    "this antiquated algorithm runs into difficulty when the function @xmath29 is short ranged .",
    "in particular , short bonds that are adjacent but not sharing a common plaquette generate long bonds under rearrangement , so whenever the amplitudes for long bonds become small , the acceptance rate can become correspondingly small .",
    "worse , there are typically many trapping configurations from which the simulation can not emerge .",
    "the worm algorithm does not suffer from these problems , because it can traverse any local barriers by stepping outside the space of closed loops .",
    "( we make no claims of novelty in this regard .",
    "other approaches to overcome the sampling difficulty have been presented elsewhere.@xcite )      the discussion in the previous section was specific to the case in which ( i ) the ab pattern is regular and ( ii ) the @xmath76 vectors that have nonzero @xmath29 only connect sites in opposite sublattices .",
    "if those conditions hold , there are only two possible consequences to the motion of the open string : a loop is joined to the string ( @xmath163 ) or a loop is split off from it ( @xmath164 ) . in both cases , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic ] by panels ( a)@xmath165(b ) and ( d)@xmath165(e ) , the ab pattern itself is left undisturbed .    more generally , as the open string propagates it lays down a chain of singlet bonds whose alternating site labels may be at odds with the traversed sites current ab assignments .",
    "a simple workaround is to flip the sublattice labels as required to correct the mismatch .",
    "the relevant processes are now those in which a moving open string absorbs a closed loop ( @xmath163 ) or reorganizes itself without impinging on any additional sites ( @xmath166 ) . the first case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic ] by panels ( a)@xmath165(c ) and the second by ( d)@xmath165(f ) or ( d)@xmath165(g ) .",
    "a crucial consideration is that , since the singlets are directional , flipping sublattice labels along a loop segment has the effect of reversing a chain of singlet bonds .",

    "an important detail is that the optimizations are carried out with the bond amplitudes constrained to have @xmath31- and @xmath32-axis reflection symmetry but not necessarily @xmath33 rotation symmetry . in the case of the checkerboard simulation ,",
    "the amplitudes nonetheless realize the full lattice symmetry under optimization up to large values of the relative coupling . for small lattice sizes",
    "@xmath218 , the symmetry breaks down beyond values @xmath219 .",
    "for all larger sizes , that point is pushed well to the right of @xmath46 .",

    "the optimized bond amplitudes are positive definite and an almost perfect function of bond length .",
    "as the frustration increases , the amplitudes begin to deviate from circular symmetry , developing strong lobes of weight along the x and y axes .",

    "[ fig : marshall ] pinpoints the breakdown of the marshall sign rule at @xmath39 .",
    "what this suggests is that there is strict adherence to a checkerboard marshall sign rule only below @xmath40 ; in the range @xmath221 , the sign rule is violated , even though the overall sign structure is still partially consistent with the checkerboard pattern .",

    "] we find that the on the large coupling side is not comparable .",
    "there , the coupling at which bond amplitudes first go negative scales as @xmath224 and hence does not converge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the static stripe pattern is only ever a weak description of the marshall sign structure .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] .",
    "we have attempted to confirm this picture by running simulations in which the marshall sign structure is determined dynamically .",
    "more specifically , we want to verify that the strongly first - order transition at @xmath46 is not merely an artifact of two static , incompatible sublattice conventions colliding . and we would like to see if any pattern other than checkerboard or stripe could emerge on its own . if permitted , might the system s sublattice structure smoothly interpolate over some range of @xmath43 , with the peak in @xmath175 migrating from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ? or perhaps with the peak in @xmath175 broadening into incoherence ? we follow the procedure outlined in sect .  [ sect : dynamic ] , whereby the sublattice is no longer fixed and the worm motion itself is allowed to reconfigure the current ab pattern .",
    "our approach is to simulate for various @xmath43 values  with _ no _ daisy chaining  in each case starting from a random ab pattern and a random loop configuration .",
    "the bond amplitudes are initialized with @xmath29 forming a broad peak around @xmath225 and having no zero entries .",
    "we perform a crude simulation in which the signs associated with the worm updates are thrown away .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : sign_problem ] . ) otherwise , the optimization of @xmath29 proceeds as before .",
    "what we find is a result that exactly tracks the state of lower energy produced by assuming one of the two static ab patterns .",
    "the simulation flows to the checkerboard for all @xmath36 and to the stripe for all @xmath226 ; the peak in @xmath175 jumps discontinuously .",
    "obviously we should not read too much into a result that follows from an uncontrolled approximation ( sampling by ignoring the signs ) , but it does give us a sense that the stability of the checkerboard pattern through the intermediate phase and the abrupt change in marshall sign structure at @xmath46 might be genuine features of the model .    the optimized state in the intermediate phase",
    "is definitely not a bond crystal . for a given lattice ,",
    "the dimer correlations are somewhat enhanced in the strongly frustrated region , but with increasing lattice size they show clear convergence to zero .",
    "still , spatially resolved dimer correlations do give us important information .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_pattern ] that the optimized state shows the same pattern of dimer correlation and anticorrelation as the nnrvb , but it decays much faster as a function of dimer separation .",
    "the comparison is made more explicit in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_corr ] , which shows correlations along a line and a stack of dimers .",
    "the functions measured are @xmath227 which we have expressed in terms of the @xmath31-directed bond operator @xmath228 .",
    "we have used an optimized valence bond trial wave function to study the square - lattice @xmath14@xmath1 heisenberg model , with an eye to both mapping out the zero - temperature phase diagram and determining how the marshall sign structure breaks down near the phase boundaries . in the first instance",
    ", we fix the ab sublattice to coincide with the order that exists at small and large coupling . for each lattice size , the intermediate phase is approached in two independent simulations ( or , rather , chains of history - dependent simulations ) by evolving the states progressively out of the two ordered phases , minimizing their energy at each step .",
    "these simulations are fully non - sign - problematic , since the ab pattern is fixed and the bond amplitudes are restricted to be positive .",
    "finite - size scaling of the dimer order parameter suggests that there is no long - range dimer order at any value of @xmath43 .",
    "this is as expected , since the trial state explicitly ignores bond - bond correlations beyond those generated by the hardcore tiling constraint .",
    "measurements of the staggered magnetization show clear evidence of a continuous phase transition in which the staggered magnetization vanishes at @xmath34 . on the other edge of the intermediate phase , an energy level crossing at @xmath35 results in the sudden disappearance of the otherwise robust stripe magnetization .",
    "this is accompanied by the restoration of the system s rotational symmetry .",
    "( since the trial state is least able to describe the intermediate phase ",
    "again , because of its lack of explicit bond - bond correlations  we should probably view @xmath38 and @xmath46 as upper and lower bounds , respectively , on the true positions of the phase boundaries . )",
    "we have also performed calculations ( approximate and uncontrolled , but suggestive ) in which no sublattice is put in by hand and the ab pattern is allowed to emerge dynamically .",
    "we find that , regardless of the initial sublattice assignment , the simulation reliably settles into the checkerboard pattern for all @xmath36 and the stripe for all @xmath229 .",
    "taken together , our results point to the checkerboard ab pattern being the best choice throughout the intermediate phase . hence ,",
    "within the context of our particular trial wave function scheme , we surmise that the state beyond @xmath38 is a `` bosonic '' spin liquid with the lowest - lying magnetic excitations at @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : amplitudes ] gives a quick summary of our results .",
    "we observe that at high frustration the bond amplitudes take on a highly anisotropic form .",
    "this is quite different from the long - bond to short - bond picture that is usually invoked .",
    "recall that liang , ducot , and anderson studied long - range rvb states on the square lattice with amplitudes @xmath230 that decay as a power law in the bond length @xmath231 .",
    "@xcite in that framework , the state becomes magnetically disordered when @xmath232 exceeds a critical value of 3.3 ,  @xcite and the entire family of states in the range @xmath233 is continuously connected to @xmath234 , which is the ( short - bond - only ) nnrvb .",
    "the intermediate phase state obtained in our simulations is of a quite different character : ( i ) the state is magnetically disordered not because its bond amplitudes are uniformly short ranged but because they have become short ranged over some sufficiently large angular interval of bond orientation ; ( ii ) its spin and dimer correlations are distinct from those of the nnrvb ; and ( iii ) the presence of many system - spanning bonds implies that the usual topological invariant for short - ranged rvb states , defined by the parity of bond cuts along a reference line,@xcite is almost certainly not a good quantum number .",
    "this work was supported by a discovery grant from nserc of canada .",
    "the rvb ansatz assumes that the quantum amplitude @xmath11 associated with each valence bond state @xmath235 is of the factorizable form @xmath236 \\in v } h(\\mathbf{r}_{ij } ) \\equiv \\prod_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{r } } } h(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}})^{n(\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}};v)}.\\ ] ] the first product ranges over all pairs of spins forming a singlet bond .",
    "the second ranges over the minimal set of vectors @xmath237 that are inequivalent under whatever lattice symmetries have been enforced .",
    "the whole - number exponent @xmath238 represents how many times a bond amplitude @xmath29 , with @xmath76 symmetry - equivalent to @xmath237 , appears in the product for a given @xmath65 .",
    "[ hence , @xmath239 , the number of bonds appearing in @xmath235 . ]    accordingly , the energy expectation value is @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the loop estimator of the hamiltonian .",
    "the notation @xmath242 denotes averaging with respect to the monte carlo weight @xmath243 here , each configuration @xmath75 is a superposition of two dimer coverings , and the sum @xmath244 is the combined count of @xmath237-type bonds in states @xmath235 and @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath246 on the right - hand - side of eq .   acknowledges that the configuration weight may be negative if the sublattice pattern is not fixed . by way of the identity @xmath247",
    "we find that the downhill direction in the energy landscape by @xmath248 is related to the energy to bond count correlation function @xmath249 in anticipation of eq .",
    ", we have used @xmath250 to denote averaging with respect to the @xmath251 monte carlo bin .",
    "our optimization procedure is carried out as follows . for a given logarithmic amplitude @xmath252 ,",
    "we generate a sequence of ( not always energy - reducing ) steps @xmath253 @xmath254 is a random number chosen from the uniform distribution on the interval @xmath255 $ ] , and @xmath256 counts the steps taken through the landscape .",
    "the @xmath257 power ensures that the step size envelope decreases by a factor 10 over the course of 1000 steps .",
    "the optimization is run repeatedly with restarts for step sizes beginning at @xmath258 and reduced by successive powers of two until convergence is achieved .",
    "the most serious difficulty is that the correlation function estimates @xmath259 become increasingly noisy for large system sizes , to the point where the determination of @xmath260 is no longer reliable .",
    "the problem is most acute for the longest bonds , which appear least frequently and thus have the worst statistics .",
    "( the bond amplitudes , which represent the probability of a given type of bond appearing during the monte carlo sampling , fall off rapidly as a function of bond length . )    in small amounts , this noise does not interfere with the energy optimization .",
    "it simply overlays a randomizing motion , somewhat akin to the effect of nonzero temperature in simulated annealing .",
    "nonetheless , good convergence requires that the noise fall below a certain threshold ( set by the depth and curvature of the well in which the energy minimum sits . ) in practice , mitigating the noise means taking the monte carlo bin size large enough so that the longest bonds in the system ( with length @xmath261 ) appear often enough in the sampling .",
    "this consideration sets the limit on the systems sizes we can optimize .",
    "the energy computed by ignoring signs [ i.e. , by sampling with respect to the _ magnitude _ of eq .  ] is @xmath262 making the substitution @xmath263 , we can rewrite eq .   as the ratio of averages @xmath264 hence , the energy discrepancy @xmath265 takes the form of a correlation function @xmath266    if the @xmath267 term fluctuates within the simulation so that @xmath268 , evaluation of @xmath269 is impossible due to large statistical uncertainties . despite this",
    ", the actual value of @xmath269 may itself be small if there is only a weak correlation between the sign and the energy estimator .",
    "moreover , @xmath269 is identically zero if the @xmath29 values evolve to produce a static sublattice .",
    "so , at the very least , we can view as a rigorous result the fact that no new static pattern emerged over the course of our simulations .",
