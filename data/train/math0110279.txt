    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first we find a  presentation for the vassiliev model as a  certain homotopy colimit , thus bringing the two models to a  common formal framework .",
    "second , by using a  diagram - theoretic generalization of simplicial collapses , coupled with the technical machinery of discrete morse theory , @xcite , we describe a  sequence of generalized collapses leading from the vassiliev model to the ziegler - ivaljevi model .",

    "the continuity of this deformation at any time @xmath95 follows from the fact that @xmath88 is an identity map , and the continuity at @xmath96 follows from the definition of the category @xmath8 ( the morphisms are continuous maps ) .",
