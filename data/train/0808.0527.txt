    "granular chains under impulse loading are known to support a rich variety of excitations  @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the excitations depends on a number of features that include the particular granular configurations , state of precompression , dimensionality , shape of initial disturbance and , of particular interest to us in this work , viscosity .",
    "consider first the behavior of a monodisperse one - dimensional chain in which the granules are placed side by side , just touching but without precompression .",
    "a velocity @xmath0 imparted to a single grain quickly evolves into a solitary wave carrying energy whose dynamical evolution depends on the nature of the granules .",
    "in particular , for elastic spherical grains one obtains a solitary wave that resides on about 5 - 7 granules and whose velocity depends on its amplitude  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the effect of viscosity on the propagation of such an initial excitation .",
    "there are a number of different sources and descriptions of viscous effects  @xcite , and in  @xcite we studied the dynamics of a pulse in one such case , when the granular chain is immersed in a viscous medium that gives rise to a stokes drag proportional to grain velocity . here",
    "we consider the more prelavent situation in which the viscosity arises from the interaction between the grains as one grain rubs against another , expanding on our earlier results for this case  @xcite . here",
    "the dissipative contributions are proportional to the relative velocities of grains in elastic contact .",
    "it should be noted that in experiments on a chain immersed in some liquids the main dissipative contribution was also found to be proportional to the relative velocities of grains ( rather than a stokes drag term ) due to the expulsion of liquid from the area of developing elastic contact  @xcite . while the former viscous interaction leads to energy _ and _ momentum loss to the medium , the latter involves only internal dissipative forces and is consequently momentum conserving .",
    "if there were only binary collisions in the chain , the momentum conserving dissipation would be one possible dynamical description of the usual parametrized coefficient of restitution  @xcite .",
    "our model is the simplest example of a strongly nonlinear discrete system that can be verified experimentally .",
    "it consists of a chain of granules that interact via the purely repulsive power law potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a prefactor determined by young s modulus @xmath4 , the poisson ratio @xmath5 , and the principal radius of curvature @xmath6 of the surfaces at the point of contact  @xcite ; @xmath7 is the displacement of granule @xmath8 from its equilibrium position .",

    "the force between two grains is nonzero only when the grains are in contact , and consists of the mechanical force which is the negative derivative of the potential , and a viscous force that is proportional to the relative velocity of the interacting granules .",
    "we introduce the rescaled position @xmath12 , time @xmath13 , and viscosity coefficient @xmath14 used in refs .",

    "the heaviside function @xmath19 ensures that the elastic and the viscous grain interactions exist only if the grains are in contact .",
    "note that in this scaled equation of motion the constant @xmath3 as well as the mass have been scaled out , and the initial velocity imparted to a grain is now unity . in the absence of viscosity",
    "an initial impulse given to one grain of the chain of otherwise resting grains placed side by side quickly settles into a forward propagating stationary pulse that is increasingly narrow with increasing @xmath20 . as we will show , and as one might expect , the viscosity results in an overall exponential energy dissipation .",
    "in a viscous medium , if a stokes drag is the dominant source of dissipation , this is essentially all that the viscosity does  @xcite , so that the pulse simply keeps moving without changing its shape but with a decreasing amplitude ( and consequently velocity ) .",
    "remarkably , in the present situation with dissipation determined by the relative velocity of grains the behavior is entirely different .",
    "below a critical viscosity , there is a steady removal of energy from the pulse , part of which contributes to the formation of a long tail created behind it from which energy is dissipated much more slowly .",
    "the removal of energy from the leading pulse is rapid because , being very narrow , it has large velocity gradients , the long tail that evolves behind it loses energy far more slowly because the velocity gradients there are very small  @xcite .",
    "exact analytic solutions to the equations of motion  ( [ eq : motion ] ) appear unattainable , and so in this work we rely heavily on numerical simulations , with analytic arguments where possible . in sec .",

    "a velocity is imparted to a single grain at one end of the chain . below a critical viscosity , after a short time in which a small amount of energy is lost through some back - scattering of nearby granules in the wake , almost all of the impact energy resides in a forward traveling wave that has an unusual two - part structure which is formed very rapidly and comes about as follows  @xcite . a pulse similar to a narrow solitary wave caused by the strongly nonlinear forces in the discrete medium",
    "is generated .",
    "this  primary pulse , \" being spatially very narrow , exhibits high velocity gradients that lead to a loss of its energy .",
    "some of the lost energy is simply dissipated , but part of the energy of the leading pulse goes into a quasistatic compression that appears behind the primary pulse because the forward displacements of the particles closer to the impacted end are larger than the corresponding displacements of particles further away from this end due to the attenutation of the velocity of the particles in the propagating wave .",
    "this compression , and the associated pulse that arises as a result (  secondary pulse \" ) , are entirely dependent on the presence of dissipation . as a result , this two - wave structure is not observed in the usual dissipationless models .",

    "the primary pulse is a highly non - stationary portion of the wave that maximizes the rate of dissipation of some of the energy , as reflected in the steep exponential decay associated with this loss .",
    "the energy decay slows down drastically as the primary pulse vanishes and only the more persistent secondary pulse remains .",
    "dissipation of energy in the rapid decay regime is faster for higher @xmath9 .",

    "when the pulse is extremely narrow , a decidedly discrete binary collision approximation works even better  @xcite , but the continuum approximation still works well at least qualitatively . some of the effects of discreteness are captured by expanding @xmath30 about @xmath12 in a taylor series up to fourth order ( the usual second order or diffusive expansion would of course not capture any such effects ) .",

    "one can go further and take advantage of the fact that almost all of the initial energy resides in this pulse ( an extremely small portion is lost to back scattering  @xcite ) . using conservation of energy arguments and dealing carefully with the fact that due to nonlinearity the kinetic ( @xmath39 ) and potential ( @xmath40 ) energies are not equal but instead obey a generalized equipartition theorem  @xcite , one further finds that @xmath41 so that @xmath42 $ ] . the kinetic energy can be calculated directly by explicit integration , @xmath43 where @xmath44 this result together with the generalized equipartition theorem then leads to explicit values for @xmath35 and @xmath45 .",

    "[ figure14 ] are repeated in this figure at the same instant of time , specifically the presence of a primary and a secondary pulse when the viscosity is small , and , at higher viscosities the single shock - type pulse of increasing front width as viscosity increases .",
    "the new feature here , namely , the rarefaction wave and the tail of attenuating compression peaks with zero minimum amplitude that follow the secondary wave , are due to the precompression .",
    "they occur at zero viscosity and survive the effects of low viscosities .",
    "the attenuating compression peaks of zero minimum amplitude are related to the rattling of partciles at the impacted end accompanied by the opening and closing of gaps . in figs .",
    "[ figure16 ] and [ figure17 ] we see that increasing precompression causes the secondary wave ( when it is visible at all ) to decrease in amplitude and width , but that the other features ( primary wave with trailing rarefaction wave and attenuating oscillatory tail at lower viscosities , single shock type pulse at higher viscosities ) continue to persist .",
    "note that greater precompression leads to a stronger ( and therefore faster ) primary pulse , an effect that has nothing to do with the viscosity but that we just point to for completeness of the description .",
    "axis in each panel goes from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , and viscosity increases downward , as indicated .",
    ", width=377 ]     axis in each panel goes from @xmath115 to @xmath117 , and viscosity increases downward , as indicated . ,",
    "width=377 ]     axis in each panel goes from @xmath115 to @xmath118 , and viscosity increases downward , as indicated .",
    ", width=377 ]    finally , we recall that with weak or zero precompression the velocity of the primary excitation is related to its amplitude in a nonlinear fashion determined by the nonlinearity of the medium ( and of course by the dissipation that causes a decrease in the amplitude with time ) and essentially unrelated to any speed of sound in the medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the secondary pulse velocity is related to the compression of the medium that follows the primary pulse and is determined by the speed of sound . with increasing precompression , the speed of sound increasingly determines the speed of disturbance propagation , as we can see , for example , in fig .",
    "[ figure17 ] , where all four panels show essentially the same speed .",
    "the larger the precompression , the smaller the effect of the nonlinearity ; at sufficiently high precompression relative to the compression caused by the initial pulse , the medium effectively becomes linear .",
    "finally , the introduction of relatively large gaps in the initial distribution of granules causes the system to no longer behave as a collective entity and it will instead resemble a granular gas .",
    "we have determined that gaps up to size of order @xmath119 in our dimensionless units lead to behavior similar to that of the original system .",
    "however , beyond this the loss of energy and the character of the excitation begin to change drastically .",
    "in this work we have explored the interplay of nonlinearity , discreteness , and dissipation in a one - dimensional dense granular chain .",
    "in particular , we have expanded on our earlier demonstration of an interesting two - wave structure observed in a dissipative granular chain excited by a @xmath120-force applied to a single grain  @xcite .",
    "one might expect a one - wave structure such as an attenuating solitary wave or an attenuating shock wave  the observation of a complex two - wave structure is certainly unusual .",
    "this structure , which occurs at low viscosities ( but _ requires _ non - zero viscosity ) , consists of a primary wave characteristic of a discrete nonlinear nondissipative sonic vacuum , and a secondary shock - like long wave due entirely to intergrain contact viscosity .",
    "the high velocity gradients in the narrow primary pulse leads to its relatively rapid attenuation , which we have shown numerically to be exponential .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the decay rate is essentially proportional to the viscosity @xmath14 , with small correction terms of @xmath121 . during its lifetime",
    ", the speed of the primary pulse is related to its amplitude in the same way as in a nondissipative chain  @xcite , but now they both decrease with time as the primary pulse dissipates .",
    "some of the dissipated energy is simply lost , while some of the initial energy of the primary pulse is transferred to the secondary pulse caused by the compression left behind by the primary pulse ( which would not occur in the absence of viscosity ) .",
    "the much smaller velocity gradients in the secondary pulse cause it to be very long - lived , and its speed is essentially the local speed of sound . below a critical viscosity",
    "the secondary pulse develops a dispersion - induced oscillatory front .",
    "there are thus three distinct time scales in this problem : an extremely short scale for the formation of the primary pulse , a relatively rapid time scale of attentuation of the primary pulse , and a very slow time scale for the eventual attenuation of the secondary pulse . at higher viscosities",
    "it becomes less and less appropriate to think of the primary and secondary pulses as separate entities .",
    "instead , one observes a spatially lengthening excitation that presents a monotonic front .",
    "this description is appropriate after a very short time during which there is always a primary pulse , with formation and evolution characteristics essentially independent of the viscosity .",
    "but this primary pulse is dissipated very quickly at higher viscosities and most of the dynamical regime is dominated by the shock - like wave .",
    "we have provided a particularly detailed picture of the formation and evolution of the structure when the grains are initially in contact with one another but without precompression ( sonic vacuum ) .",
    "we also explored the consequences of relaxing the initial configuration , particularly to the case of initial precompression .",
    "we found that as long as the precompression is small compared to the dynamical compression produced by the initial velocity impulse , the features described above are still observed , albeit somewhat complicated by the appearance of a rarefication wave and a tail of attentuating compression peaks of zero minimum amplitude behind the secondary wave .",
    "as before , there are distinct primary and secondary waves when the viscosity is low , and ( except for very short times ) a single shock - type pulse when the viscosity is high . we also observed that increasing precompression leads to increasingly linear behavior in which any oscillatory features decrease in amplitude , and the excitation propagates at essentially the speed of sound in the medium .",
    "finally , we briefly explored the opposite relaxation of the initial condition , namely , the effect of initial gaps between the grains . when these gaps are extremely small , of size @xmath119 or smaller in our dimensionless units , the behavior is similar to that of the chain without gaps , but beyond this the character of the dynamics of the excitation changes drastically .",
    "we have not explored this regime in detail .",
    "we expect the two - wave phenomenon involving vastly different length and time scales to occur in other nonlinear discrete dissipative systems under conditions of short pulse loading . examples might include femtosecond - laser generated pulses , waves generted in atomic lattices by bombardment of low density beams of ions , and waves in three - dimensional packings of spherical beads immersed in liquid under short - duration plane explosive loading .",
    "while our analysis has focused on one - dimensional chains , we expect the phenomenon to occur in systems of higher dimensions as well , where issues of geometry of the constituents and of the initial loading introduce additional interesting variables .",
