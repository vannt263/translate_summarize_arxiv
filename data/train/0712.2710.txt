    "among the essential goals of qcd spin physics one has first , to understand the nucleon spin structure in terms of its basic partonic constituents and second , to test the _",
    "spin sector _ of perturbative qcd , at the highest possible precision level . concerning the first point",
    ", one needs to know how the quark and gluon distributions in a polarized nucleon make its spin one - half and several questions arise in particular : what is the role of the orbital angular momentum ?",
    "the second point is very relevant to reinforce the validity of the already well established perturbative qcd theory , because many spin asymmetries have been calculated , at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and have not yet been compared with experimental data .",
    "therefore it is very legitimate to ask to what extent they will agree .",
    "we will try to answer the following questions : what is known ? what is missing ?",
    "what needs to be measured next ?",
    "what are the prospects ?",

    "similarly @xmath9 s ( same for antiquarks ) are defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the gluon distributions are also defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but in dis they are not accessible directly and only enter in the qcd @xmath13 evolution of the quark distributions . + there is a long list of interesting topics , _",
    "e.g. _ characteristic features of unpolarized and polarized parton distributions , flavor separation of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , gluon polarization in the nucleon , generalized parton distributions , quark transversity @xmath16 and double transverse spin asymmetries @xmath17 , single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) @xmath18 and qcd mechanisms , etc ... + in this opening lecture , for lack of time , we will have to make a strong selection , but given the high density of the scientific program , it will certainly allow to cover all missing important subjects .",
    "a new set of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) was constructed in the framework of a statistical approach of the nucleon @xcite , which has the following characteristic features : + - for quarks ( antiquarks ) , the building blocks are the helicity dependent distributions @xmath5 ( @xmath19 ) and we define @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( similarly for antiquarks ) .",
    "+ - at the initial energy scale taken at @xmath22 , these distributions are given by the sum of two terms , a quasi fermi - dirac function and a helicity independent diffractive contribution , which leads to a universal behavior for all flavors at very low @xmath23 .",
    "+ - the flavor asymmetry for the light sea , _ i.e. _ @xmath24 , observed in the data is built in . this",
    "is clearly understood in terms of the pauli exclusion principle , based on the fact that the proton contains two @xmath25 quarks and only one @xmath26 quark .",
    "+ - the chiral properties of qcd lead to strong relations between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "+ for example , it is found that the well estalished result @xmath29  implies @xmath30 and similarly @xmath31 leads to @xmath32 . + - concerning the gluon , the unpolarized gluon distribution is given in terms of a quasi bose - einstein function , with _ no free parameter _ , but for simplicity , one assumes zero gluon polarization , _ i.e. _ @xmath33 , at the initial energy scale .",
    "+ - all unpolarized and polarized distributions depend upon _ eight _ free parameters , which were determined in 2002 ( see @xcite ) , from an nlo fit of a selected set of accurate dis data .",
    "+ for illustration , the @xmath34 light quark ( antiquark ) distributions are displayed on fig . 1 and we clearly notice the essential features mentioned above .",
    "more recently , new tests against experimental ( unpolarized and polarized ) data turned out to be very satisfactory , in particular in hadronic reactions @xcite . +     on the left ( right ) the light quark ( antiquark ) distributions with different helicities versus @xmath23 for @xmath35 , taken from ref .",

    "however a careful analysis of the data led us to the conclusion that @xmath39 and the corresponding polarized distributions are unequal , small and negative @xcite . + now let us come back to the important prediction of the statistical approach , namely @xmath40 and @xmath32 , which contrasts with the flavor symmetric assumption @xmath41 made , for example , in ref .",

    "fortunately , by using the rhicbos code due to p. nadolski , one finds that @xmath81 has essentially the same trend as @xmath61 .",
    "+ so much for the quarks , let us now turn to the gluon distributions and we first consider the unpolarized distribution @xmath82 . in the statistical approach it has a very simple expression ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is consistent with the available data , most coming indirectly from the qcd @xmath13 evolution of @xmath83 , defined earlier , in particular in the low @xmath23 region",

    "the contribution of the later to the cross section at hera is only sizeable at @xmath23 smaller than approximately @xmath86 and in this domain the gluon density dominates over the sea quark density .",

    "@xcite).,width=302 ]    the polarized gluon distribution @xmath89 is also extremely important to determine and we have the following helicity sum rule @xmath90 where @xmath91dx$ ] is twice the quark ( + antiquark ) contribution to the nucleon helicity and @xmath89 , @xmath92 are the contributions of gluon and orbital angular momentum of quark and gluon . so far @xmath93 and the sum rule is not satisfied .",
    "+ there are several attempts to extract @xmath94 from dis using different processes and the most recent results will be presented later in this workshop .",
    "the rhic spin program is also putting a high priority to this determination and the cleanest reaction is inclusive prompt photon production , which is dominated by the subprocess @xmath95 . the double helicity asymmetry , which has schematically the following expression @xmath96}{\\sum_q e_q^2 \\left[q(x_2)+ \\bar{q}(x_2 ) \\right ] } \\bigg ] \\cdot   \\hat{a}_{ll}(gq \\rightarrow \\gamma q ) + ( 1\\leftrightarrow 2)~,\\ ] ] is directly proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "this has not been measured yet , but from the measurements on @xmath97 , we have all indications that @xmath89 is small and still badly known , unfortunately .",
    "+ the next very serious question is indeed : are there relevant contributions from @xmath92 ?",
    "the existence of this new quark distribution @xmath16 , was first mentioned by ralston and soper in 1979 , by studying the angular distribution in @xmath98 with transversely polarized protons .",
    "it was merely forgotten until 1990 , where it was first realized that it completes the description of the quark distribution in a nucleon as a density matrix @xmath99 this quark transversity @xmath16 is chiral odd , leading twist and decouples from dis .",
    "so it was never measured and we only have the following positivity bound @xcite @xmath100 which survives up to nlo corrections .",
    "it is indeed accessible in @xmath98 , with both protons transversely polarized .",
    "the double transverse spin asymmetry @xmath17 reads @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the dilepton mass square .",
    "it involves the product of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as expected from the dominant @xmath106 annihilation drell - yan mechanism .",
    "predictions using the saturation of the bound , lead to some estimates of only a few percents , but it is on the list of future measurements at the bnl - rhic spin program . + the asymmetry at the @xmath72 pole , which reads @xmath107 is also expected to be small .",
    "however , for the @xmath108 production , considered above , @xmath109 , because the @xmath54 has a @xmath110 coupling , _ i.e. _ @xmath111 , which remains to be checked .",
    "+ there is no such a transversity distribution for gluons which carry a spin one and this fact has important consequences for @xmath17 of different reactions .",
    "for example in the case of single - jet production , according to pqcd , the cross section in the low @xmath112 region is dominated by gluon- gluon collisions , in the medium @xmath112 region by gluon - quark collisions and in the high @xmath112 region by quark - quark collisions . as a result , @xmath17 is expected to be non - zero only in this last kinematic region and this is what we see on the left hand side of fig .",
    "we have a similar situation for prompt photon production , shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "6 . these results , which were obtained by using the positivity bound , probe the sensitivity only to quark transversity in the hight @xmath112 region . as was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect double spin transverse asymmetries to be much smaller than double helicity asymmetries , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath113 and this theoretical observation must be carefully confirmed experimentally .    left : upper bounds for @xmath17 for single jet production at rhic , with the expected statistical errors .",
    "right : same for prompt photon production ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite).,title=\"fig:\",width=298 ] left : upper bounds for @xmath17 for single jet production at rhic , with the expected statistical errors .",
    "right : same for prompt photon production ( taken from ref .",
    "what is a single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) ? + consider the collision of a proton of momentum @xmath114 , carrying a transverse spin @xmath115 and producing an outgoing hadron with transverse momentum @xmath116 .",
    "the ssa defined as @xmath117 is zero , unless the cross section contains a term @xmath118 .",
    "it can be shown that this requires the existence of an _ helicity flip _ and _ final state interactions _ , which generate a phase difference between the flip and the non - flip amplitudes , to avoid violation of time reversal invariance . in the naive parton model one",
    "expects very small ssa , because of the double suppression @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the quark mass and @xmath121 the energy scale of the process .",
    "+ actually a large ssa has been discovered 30 years ago at fnal with a 300 gev / c unpolarized proton beam in @xmath122 @xcite and many",
    "more ssa have been observed later , in particular large ssa in @xmath123 and @xmath124 at fnal by e704 @xcite and more recently by star at bnl - rhic @xcite .",
    "these data have the same trend , as shown in fig .  7 , although they were obtained in very different energy ranges",
    ". therefore one can be tempted to conclude that they originate from the same mechanism satisfying scaling . +",
    "before discussing this point , we recall that in the collinear approximation , the mechanism to generata ssa is based on higher - twist quark - gluon correlators ( efremov - teryaev 1982 , qiu - sterman 1991 ) .",
    "however , if one introduces transverse momentum dependence ( tmd ) , two qcd mechanisms have been proposed : + - tmd parton distributions @xmath125 sivers effect 1990 + - tmd fragmentation distributions @xmath125 collins effect 1993 + the gauge - invariance properties of the tmd pdf have been first clarified for dis and drell - yan processes in ref .  @xcite . in general",
    "both sivers and collins effects contribute to a specific reaction , although there are some cases in which only one of them contributes . for example in semi inclusive dis , the collins effect is the only mechanism that can lead to asymmetries @xmath126 and @xmath127 . on the other hand , it does not appear in some electroweak interaction processes , where there is only the sivers effect . in prompt photon production in @xmath50 collisions , which is dominated by @xmath128 ,",
    "the ssa is sensitive to either the quark or the gluon sivers functions , according to the value of the photon @xmath129 @xcite . + now let us ask : do we understand the ssa displayed on fig .  7 , given the fact that star is at a very small angle 2.6 deg . , whereas e704 is at a much larger angle , between 9 deg . and 64 deg . ?",
    "a negative answer is partially obtained by looking at the cross section .",
    "the pqcd nlo calculation underestimates the cross section at _ low _ energies and _ medium _ angles , namely for the e704 kinematic region .",
    "this is shown on fig .",
    "7 and it means that one should not ignore other contributions .",
    "this is not the case at 90 deg . and at very small angles at high energy , which is the star kinematic range .",
    "to conclude , one should not try to `` explain '' the ssa , ignoring the unpolarized cross section @xcite .",
    "of course one should not forget resummation effects , which might help clarifying the situation .",
