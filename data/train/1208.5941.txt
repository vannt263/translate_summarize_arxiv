    "this weak inter - layer interaction , which has rendered it a good solid lubricant @xcite , proves also essential in determining the effect of the number of stacking layers on manifold novel properties , such as raman frequency @xcite , band - gap type ( direct , indirect ) and band - gap size @xcite .",
    "van der waals interaction may enhance some intriguing properties on one hand , while suppressing electrical transport properties @xcite on the other . mos@xmath0 and",
    "other transition metal dichalcogenide materials were reported to have very pronounced values of thermopower , but poor electrical conductivity @xcite , leading to a negligibly small value of the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ( zt @xmath1 0.006 at the optimal doping and working temperature ) @xcite . to improve upon its electrical conductivity for a better value of zt , pressure / stress may be employed to tune the inter - layer interaction and expected to suppress vdw bonding or to convert it to covalent or metallic type .",

    "stress - induced enhancement of electron mobility in mos@xmath0 single layer has been demonstrated in experiment @xcite for a promising nano - electronic device .",
    "first - principles calculations have shown that both compressive @xcite and tensile strain @xcite in a single layer give rise to a reduced band gap .",
    "a semiconductor - metal transition was obtained for a compressive strain of about 15@xmath2 for single - layer mos@xmath0 @xcite . for bulk transition - metal chalcogenide , except for some experimental studies on pressure - induced structural change@xcite ,",
    "there have been so far no theoretical reports on the pressure effect . in particular , how pressure affects the electronic structure and if it can ultimately improve its thermoelectric properties have never been investigated .    in this work , combining first - principles density functional calculations with semiclassical boltzmann transport theory , we study the change of unit cell allowed by the crystal structure , electronic structure and thermoelectric transport properties of mos@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "our calculation shows a vanishing anisotropy in the rate of structural change at around 25 gpa , in agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we also find a concurrent conversion from vdw interaction to covalent - like type and a semiconductor - metal transition at about 25 gpa .",
    "this transition improves greatly the inter - layer electrical conductivity but still keeps a large value of thermopower ( @xmath3 ) , therefore giving rise to appreciably enhanced thermoelectric transport properties .",
    "values of figure of merit ( zt ) as high as 0.65 along cross - plane direction are obtainable in a wide range of temperature ( from 200 k to 700 k ) .",
    "our study demonstrates that applying high hydrostatic pressure can be an effective way to improve the thermoelectric performance of mos@xmath0 and of other transition - metal dichalcogenides .",
    "mos@xmath0 has p@xmath4/mmc space group symmetry and consists of a hexagonal plane of mo atoms sandwiched by two hexagonal planes of s atoms .",

    "we consider the external hydrostatic pressure no larger than 50 gpa , where no occurrence of structural phase transition has been observed experimentally @xcite and the structure remains to have p@xmath4/mmc space group symmetry .",

    "[ fig - band ] ]    to see what happens to the inter - layer interaction upon pressure , we studied total charge densities in the region between s@xmath17 and s@xmath0 atom under hydrostatic pressure ranging from 0 to 50 gpa ( fig .",

    "[ fig - rho](c ) to ( d ) .",
    "as d@xmath27 is decreasing with pressure , the vdw interaction seems firstly to increase , due to both nonspherical - charge - distribution - induced electric dipole on s@xmath17 and s@xmath0 atom ( fig.2(a ) and ( b ) ) and reduced atomic distance by pressure .",
    "this trend is consistent with that in ultra - thin mos@xmath0 ( few - layers)@xcite .",
    "then a weak covalent - like bond starts to form at 25 gpa and grows stronger at 50 gpa . to support this view",
    ", we also studied charge transfer between ab - stacking charge density @xmath19(ab ) and the sum of the two independent densities ( @xmath19(a ) + @xmath19(b ) ) of a and b sub - layers .",
    "there is charge transfer induced by pressure and charge accumulates mostly between s@xmath17 and s@xmath0 atoms .",
    "the change of inter - layer interaction will naturally lead to dependence of band structure on pressure .",
    "[ fig - band ] gives the calculated band structure evolving with pressure from 0 to 50 gpa .",
    "fermi energies of semiconductors are set at valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "the behavior of the band gap is shown from ( a ) to ( c ) and summarized in ( d ) . at zero pressure",
    "the indirect band gap @xmath18 is between vbm at the @xmath28 point and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) between @xmath28 and k points .",
    "applied pressure causes the cbm to drop , @xmath18 decreases monotonically with pressure till a semiconductor - metal transition occurs at 25 gpa .",
    "this only takes an in - plane compressive strain of 5.5% , in contrast to 15% in single layer @xcite .",
    "it seems much easier for the bulk material than the single layer to close the band gap @xmath18 by applying pressure , presumably due to the existing inter - layer interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that an increase of band dispersion with pressure is observed , except for two bands near the fermi level , between the @xmath28 and a points .",
    "these two bands are actually zone - folded from one band as the unit cell has one sub - layer . for convenience ,",
    "both bands are treated as one with band width w@xmath20 , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig - band](a ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig - band](d ) , w@xmath20 decreases from 1.1 ev ( at 0 gpa ) via 0.39 ev ( at 25 gpa ) to 0.12 ev ( at 50 gpa ) . to understand the counterintuitive behavior of the band dispersion decreasing with pressure , we look into the mo - d and s - p orbitals close to the fermi level , since they play predominate roles in forming conduction channels for both in - plane and cross - plane directions@xcite .",
    "the two cross - plane bands with the anomalous width w@xmath20 are due to hybridization of mo - d@xmath29 ( or d@xmath23 for simplicity ) and s - p@xmath22 orbitals .",
    "the symmetries of possible combinations of mo - d@xmath23 and s - p@xmath22 orbitals are illustrated in fig .",

    "the vbm at @xmath28 point has a @xmath30 symmetry @xcite , and the band below has a dominating contribution of s - p@xmath22 orbitals with @xmath31 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we found the valence band have s - p@xmath22 anti - bonding characteristic . in this sense , the shrinkage of inter - layer distance d@xmath12 with pressure suggests a stronger anti - bonding state and therefore a narrower band dispersion near e@xmath21 from @xmath28 to a.    from the band structures shown above , we can extract some useful information on the electrical conductivity of the metallic states of mos@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - band](b , c ) , we found the fermi velocity ( v@xmath21 ) and effective mass ( m@xmath32 ) respectively increasing and decreasing with pressure .",
    "calculated electronic densities of states ( doss ) ( not shown here ) of the fermi level at 25 and 50 gpa are 0.19 and 0.53 electrons / ev / u.c . , respectively . under thermal excitation within a range of interest ( e.g. , 100 - 700 k , equivalent to 0.009 - 0.060 ev of energy ) , doss translate to carrier concentrations of approximately 1.5@xmath510@xmath33 and 5@xmath510@xmath33 @xmath34 for 25 and 50 gpa , respectively .",
    "the boost of carrier concentration by pressure , together with increased v@xmath21 and reduced m@xmath32 , suggest pressure - enhanced electrical conductivity . for semiconducting states below 25 gpa",
    ", pressure reduces the band gap size , which helps improve the electrical conductivity but very little .",
    "electron / hole doping @xcite was used but it turns out to be quite challenging to dope in bulk mos@xmath0 .",
    "so far the highest experimental doping level on mos@xmath0 has reached only a few 10@xmath35 @xmath34 , far below 10@xmath36 @xmath34 usually for optimizing the thermoelectric performance of semiconducting materials @xcite .",
    "information on thermopower can also be extracted from the band structures . according to the mott relation @xcite",
    ", thermopower depends crucially on the derivative of the logarithmic electrical conductivity at the fermi level @xcite , i.e. , s @xmath1@xmath37@xmath38 . based upon this formula",
    ", a strong thermopower is anticipated for both in - plane and cross - plane directions at 25 gpa . moreover ,",
    "the anomalous @xmath28-a bands upon pressure get more flat due to inter - layer anti - bonding states existing and its band edges locate near the fermi level .",
    "it is therefore more advantageous for having high values of thermopower along cross - plane direction as pressure goes beyond 25 gpa .",
    "we have discussed qualitatively how the effect of pressure on thermopower and electrical conductivity can be estimated from some aspects of the band structure .",
    "now we turn to semi - classical boltzmann transport theory for quantitative prediction on the thermoelectric parameters of mos@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "firstly , we calculated thermopower as function of temperature at 0 , 10 , 25 , 30 and 50 gpa . from fig .",
    "[ fig - st ] , a strong anisotropy of the thermopower between two perpendicular directions appears when pressure increases from 0 to 25 gpa .",
    "the in - plane thermopower s@xmath39 drops substantially while the cross - plane thermopower s@xmath40 goes down fairly modestly .",
    "the s@xmath39 at pressure above 25 gpa is as low as in typical metals@xcite . in the contrary ,",
    "high values of the seebeck coefficient s@xmath40 were indeed obtained along cross plane direction .",
    "especially , over 100 @xmath41v / k along c - axis are achievable over a wide temperature range above 25 gpa . least important to mention is that a big value of thermopower is also found for the semiconducting mos@xmath0 at 0 and 10 gpa ( with experimental doping @xmath1",
    "10@xmath35 @xmath34 ) , which is however not very unusual from theoretical perspective @xcite .     ]",
    "similarly , we then calculated @xmath42/@xmath9 as a function of temperature .",
    "our results show that @xmath42/@xmath9 increases with external pressure .",
    "so does the electrical conductivity @xmath42 , if @xmath9 is approximately pressure independent . to find a realistic temperature dependence of @xmath42 without available experimental @xmath9",
    ", we assume that at high temperature the conduction electrons are mainly scattered by phonons and the electronic relaxation time @xmath9",
    "@xmath1 t@xmath43 is used @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath42/(@xmath9 t ) as function of temperature can give information on temperature dependence of @xmath42 .",
    "we show in - plane and cross - plane @xmath42/(@xmath9 t ) versus temperature in fig.[fig - lorenz](a , b ) . for both directions ,",
    "typical metallic behavior is seen by an inverse power law relation between @xmath42/(@xmath9 t ) and temperature at pressure higher than 25 gpa , while below 25 gpa it is semiconducting . at 25 gpa ,",
    "a deviation from the inverse power law is observed and suggests its conductive properties different from typical metals and semiconductors .",
    "as function of pressure and temperature for ( a ) in - plane and ( b ) cross - plane direction . the ratio of lorenz number l@xmath15 over @xmath44 along ( c ) in - plane and ( d ) cross - plane direction is given to show how conductive it is under various pressures from 0 gpa to 50 gpa in the background of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "[ fig - lorenz ] ]     along ( a ) in - plane and ( b ) cross - plane directions .",
    "the cross - plane is more preferable for practical thermoelectric application .",
    "[ fig - zt - t ] ]    as is known , the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit zt is defined as @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , with @xmath47 ( = @xmath48 + @xmath49 ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 as total , electronic and lattice thermal conductivity , respectively , l = @xmath44 and @xmath50 = @xmath51 . to evaluate a possible enhancement of zt value by external pressure ,",
    "we need to calculate the pressure dependence of thermal conductivity @xmath47 . unfortunately , calculating lattice thermal conductivity @xmath52 is far more complicated than calculating @xmath48 and it is beyond band structure calculations .",
    "here we argue that @xmath48 can substitute for @xmath47 under various pressures if mos@xmath0 becomes metallic , since @xmath49 is insignificant compared to @xmath48 in most metals@xcite . for a typical metal ,",
    "the wiedemann - franz law works and l is a constant called lorenz number l@xmath15(= 2.8 @xmath5 10@xmath53 w@xmath54/k@xmath55 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - lorenz](c , d ) , we draw a ratio of l@xmath15 over l as function of temperature at various pressures .",
    "the ratio l@xmath15/l approaches unity as pressure increases from 25 to 50 gpa , indicating an evaluation of zt value based on @xmath48 is legitimate .",
    "however , a strong deviation from the wiedemann - franz law occurs to the semiconducting states below and at 25 gpa , signifying @xmath49 may be as important as or even more significant than @xmath48 .",
    "assuming zt is approximately @xmath56 and bearing in mind that it may not work for semiconducting states even with heavy doping , we show the calculated zt value in fig .",
    "[ fig - zt - t ] .",
    "though zt values for semiconducting mos@xmath0 at 0 and 10 gpa seem practically high , it is basically unreliable since the @xmath49 can be orders of magnitude higher than @xmath48 and brings down zt by similar orders of magnitude@xcite . at transitional 25 gpa ,",
    "zt can reach 0.05 in plane and 0.65 along the c axis over a wide range of temperature .",
    "but due to the uncertainty between @xmath49 and @xmath48 this may need experimental confirm .",
    "what s promising here is that the values of cross - plane zt decrease modestly as pressure goes beyond 25 gpa .",
    "still significant zt value higher than 0.10 is obtained over a wide range of pressure , suggesting that a proper range of pressure is essential to optimize the thermoelectric properties of mos@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we systematically studied the structure , electronic structure and transport properties of 2h - mos@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressure , based on the boltzmann transport theory and first - principles density functional calculations .",
    "vdw corrections to gga calculations are essential to deal with such an anisotropic system under pressure .",
    "our calculation shows a vanishing anisotropy in the rate of structural change at around 25 gpa , in agreement with the experimental data . a conversion from vdw to covalent - like bonding",
    "concurrently , a transition from semiconductor to metal occurs at 25 gpa .",
    "a much smaller compressive strain in bulk material than in single layer is needed to close the band gap .",
    "we obtained in the metallic state very large values of the thermopower and ascribed it to some anomalous band features . above all , good values of figure of merit are found along the cross - plane direction .",
