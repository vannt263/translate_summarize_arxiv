    "the emission profile has significant variations over the cycle .",
    "the doppler shifts of the peaks are of relatively low velocities , @xmath7 ( damineli et al .",
    ". the location of the minimum of the profile ( the deepest point in absorption ) does not change with orbital phase , and stays at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the absorption profile does change .",
    "in particular , just before periastron a wide blue wing appear in absorption , reaching @xmath9 a month before periastron , and @xmath10 at periastron , and the maximum equivalent width of absorption occurs @xmath11 after periastron passage ( damineli et al .",
    "damineli et al . ( 2008b ) approximated the average radial velocity of the absorption profile at half intensity , and found it to change from @xmath12 before phase zero to @xmath13 shortly after phase zero .",
    "an additional he  i  @xmath0 blue absorption feature of up to @xmath14 , is observed at several arcseconds from the center in the lobes ( smith 2002 ) . in this paper",
    "we refer only to the he  i  @xmath0 ground measurements of damineli et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "we note that other absorption and emission lines of he  i can be formed in different regions in the binary system ( see also kashi & soker 2007b ) .",
    "in particular , some visible he  i lines can be formed in the hot winds of the two stars close to their origin , as compared with the he  i  @xmath0 that is formed in cooler regions .",
    "we show that this cooler region can be the post - shock primary wind .",
    "therefore , different he  i lines need not have the same behavior along the orbit .    because of the winds very complicated flow structure , when starting this project we limited ourself to build a toy - model in order to achieve two goals : ( 1 ) to show that the orientation where the secondary is toward us at periastron ( @xmath15 ) , can be accounted for the development of a wide blue absorption wing starting several weeks before periastron passage .",

    "the half opening angle of the wind - collision cone is @xmath24 ( akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) ; because of the orbital motion this angle is not constant , and we calculate it along the orbit in the present paper . for the inclination angle",
    "we take @xmath25 ( davidson et al . 2001 ; smith 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "the primary s wind speed depends on latitude ( smith et al .",
    "the minimum in the he  i  @xmath0 line profile suggests that the primary s wind speed toward us is @xmath8 .",
    "the two winds collide , and form a flow structure , schematically drawn in figure [ fig : colliding ] .",
    "the two winds go through two respective shock waves , and form a contact discontinuity between them .",
    "the contact discontinuity asymptotically forms a conical shell surface .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the post - shocked primary s wind is short .",
    "the post - shocked primary s wind forms a dense flow along the contact discontinuity , which we refer to as the _ conical shell .",
    "_ absorption is expected to take place mainly outside the stagnation - point region , and so we approximate the conical shell as an ideal cone .",
    "the he  i  @xmath0 absorption profile results from he  i atoms which absorb from the he  i  @xmath0 emission line and from the continuum emitted by dust .",
    "as we are more interested in the wide wing , the continuum is more relevant to our study . as the system approaches periastron ,",
    "dust is formed closer and closer to the binary system ( kashi & soker 2008a ) .",
    "this makes things very complicated , as the conical shell , where the absorbing gas reside according to our model , also changes its size .",
    "some of the dust is formed in the conical shell itself .",
    "other lines , e.g. @xmath26 ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , also show some fast blueshifted absorption wings .",
    "some of these wings disappear when the system approaches periastron .",
    "this is not a problem for our model , since those lines originate in different regions than where the he  i  @xmath0 line does ( e.g. the @xmath26 comes from the primary s wind ; smith et al .",
    "we emphasize again that some he  i lines ( in particular in the visible band ) are formed in different regions than the he  i  @xmath0 line , and their behavior is different as well .",
    "the binary parameter that is most controversial is the orientation of the semimajor axis@xmath27the periastron longitude .",

    "damineli et al .",
    "2008b ) , others argue that the secondary is toward us during periastron passages , @xmath15 ( falceta - gonalves et al .",

    "; kashi & soker 2007b , 2008b ) , and still different values exist in the literature ( davidson 1997 ; smith et al . 2004 ; dorland 2007 ; henley et al . 2008",
    "; okazaki et al .",
    "following our recent paper ( kashi & soker 2008b ) we will take the orientation to be such that the secondary is toward us at periastron ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we suggest that the conical shell is responsible for the absorption of the he  i  @xmath0 high excitation line .",
    "when the two winds meet at the contact discontinuity , part of the shocked fast secondary s wind is mixed with part of the shocked slow wind ( pittard 2007 ) , and accelerates part of it to higher velocities .",
    "the conical shell has an asymptotic angle of @xmath29 , which we take to be the flow direction of the absorbing gas .",
    "in order to make the model more accurate we will take into account the time dependance of some parameters .",
    "the primary s wind velocity profile can be described using the @xmath30-profile : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sound velocity on the primary s surface , @xmath22 is the primary s wind terminal velocity , and @xmath33 is a parameter of the wind model .    the radial ( along the line joining the two stars ) component of the relative velocity between the secondary star and the primary s wind is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 the radial component of the orbital velocity ; @xmath35 is negative when the two stars approach each other .",
    "the total relative speed between the secondary and the primary s wind is @xmath36^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : vwind1}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the tangential component of the orbital velocity .",
    "the orbital motion and the variation of the primary wind speed with distance from the primary have a small influence on the conical shell asymptotic angle @xmath38 .",
    "we will use the expression given by eichler & usov ( 1993 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40    we will take into consideration the rotation of the cone relatively to the line connecting the two stars .",
    "this rotation occurs due to the orbital velocity of the conical shell , and has a considerable influence close to periastron .",
    "we define @xmath41 to be the angle measured from the secondary between the direction to the primary and that to the stagnation point ( see soker 2005 for further details ) @xmath42 we find that close to periastron @xmath43 .",
    "the geometry and different parameters are shown in figures [ fig : colliding ] , [ fig : cone ] and [ fig : angles ] .",
    "a closely - related geometry was used by hill et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to fit the excess emission observed in the c iii @xmath44 line in the spectra of wr 42 and wr 79 .",
    "luehrs ( 1997 ) also used a somewhat different geometry to fit the excess emission observed in the c iii @xmath44 line in the spectra of wr 79 .",
    "these two models were purely geometric . in the model we suggest for the absorption , some more considerations have to be taken in to account .",
    "although the absorbing gas is a continuous media , we decompose the conical shell into ` tubes ' .",
    "we define @xmath45 to be the azimuthal angle on the surface of the conical shell ; @xmath46 in a direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane , and is measured clockwise .",
    "tubes exist from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . for each tube on the conical shell",
    "we calculate the angle @xmath48 between the tube and the observer as a function of the orbital angle @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig : cone ] ) @xmath50    we take @xmath51 to be the maximum velocity attended by a mass element , @xmath52 , in a tube ; in each tube there is a large number of mass elements formed by the mixing process of the two winds . by mixing we refer also to secondary shocked wind segments that have been cooled to temperature low enough to contribute to the absorption at high speeds .",
    "they reside near the contact discontinuity as well . here",
    "@xmath53 is the primary s wind velocity , and @xmath54 is a parameter of the model that is constraint to be @xmath55 .",
    "the projected velocity of mass element having a velocity @xmath56 and residing in a tube with an angle of @xmath48 to our line of sight is @xmath57 .",
    "consider one of our tubes ; it has a length @xmath58 and a circular cross section with a radius @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 .",
    "the effective cross section of the absorbing tube is @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of each tube to absorption is multiplied by @xmath62 .",
    "the amount of accelerated primary s wind to each velocity @xmath56 is hard to predict .",
    "a numerical simulation beyond the scope of this work needs to be done in order to determine this amount .",
    "we simply take the velocity distribution to be constant , namely , in each tube the fraction of the gas in the velocity interval @xmath63 is constant @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a constant .",
    "changing variable from the velocity along the tube to that along the line of sight , this weighting function ( up to a constant ) is , by using @xmath57 , @xmath66 at each orbital angle @xmath49 we sum the contribution to absorption at doppler shift @xmath67 over all tubes , @xmath68 the intensity is taken to be @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant of the toy - model that takes care of units and the condition @xmath71 .",
    "we set here@xmath72 , because we do not compare to the absorption equivalent width .",
    "our model is actually a toy - model .",
    "it assumes a simple geometry of the absorbing material , i.e. , a rotated conical shell with a varying opening angle , and a mass distribution within each tube that is constant with the velocity .",
    "the model contains two types of parameters : ( 1 ) those that are given in the literature .",
    "such are the binary parameters and the conical shape with its opening angle @xmath38 .",
    "these parameters are more or less in consensus .",
    "the orientation of the semimajor axis ( the periastron longitude @xmath73 ) is controversial , and we take the value from our previous papers @xmath74 ( secondary toward us at periastron ) . ( 2 ) parameters that are unique to our toy - model . such is the value of @xmath54 which is constraint to be @xmath55 . for these parameters",
    "we find that a good general fit can be obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "the value of the absorption coefficient @xmath70 has a small influence on our conclusions , and it serves only to give the general form of the absorption profile .",
    "the assumption that the conical shell reaches its asymptotic opening angle at large distances breaks down as the system approaches periastron .",
    "the reason is that the relative velocity of the two stars is no longer much smaller than the primary s wind speed .",
    "this causes the winding - up of the conical shell into a spiral structure in the equatorial plane , e.g. , as shown in the numerical study by okazaki et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "only a close region near the binary system reaches this limiting angle .",
    "namely , a smaller region , but much denser , will contribute to the absorption at the blue edge .",
    "however , contribution to the continuum near @xmath76 comes from the stellar wind and hot dust from closer regions to the binary system ( kashi & soker 2008a ) .",
    "therefore , the much smaller region of the conical shell can still absorb a detectable fraction of the continuum .",
    "our toy - model does not allow us to make any quantitative prediction .",
    "for that a 3d numerical code is required .",
    "nevertheless , our toy - model does allow us to reach the two goals , as mentioned in the last paragraph of section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : abs ] we present our results by a contour map of the intensity @xmath77 , as given in equation [ eq : i ] , in the doppler shift@xmath27time plane .",
    "the blue doppler shift @xmath67 is given in unit of @xmath78 , and the vertical axis indicates days relative to ( before ) periastron ( phase 0 at @xmath79 ) .",
    "the levels of the contours are @xmath80 , and so on , from left to right , where @xmath81 indicates the edge of the absorption profile . despite the constant weighting function @xmath82 that we used , in reality",
    "we expect that the amount of helium blown with high velocities corresponding to @xmath83 will be too small to be detected .",
    "we have also estimated the velocity edges of the absorption wing at four epochs from damineli et al .",
    "( 2008b ) observations ; these are indicated by four horizontal error - bar lines , .",
    "the somewhat noisy data made it difficult to pinpoint the exact edge of the wing , and therefore we could only estimate it to an accuracy of @xmath84 .",
    "each line is centered at the approximated edges of the absorption wing , and extends to @xmath85 to each direction . at early times",
    "there is no noticeable differences between the contour lines in the range @xmath86 , and all nicely fit the two observation equally well . very close to periastron , the line @xmath87 fits the observations better .",
    "however , during this time we expect the collapse of the conical shell , such that no fresh gas will be accelerated to high velocities .",
    "we can not make an accurate prediction so close to periastron passage . over all",
    ", we consider the lines @xmath86 to be a very good fit to observations .",
    "we modified the parameters in our model to fit the observations of damineli et al .",
    "( 2008b ) from the 2003 event .",
    "with this fitting we learn about two properties of the models .",
    "( 1 ) we find that the orientation we use , where the secondary is toward us at periastron ( @xmath88 ) can account for the development of a wide blue absorption wing starting several months before periastron passage , if the absorbing material is within this conical shell .",
    "( 2 ) according to our model , the maximum observed blue shift of the wing is reached @xmath89 before periastron passage .",
    "the observed maximum blue shift might occur at a somewhat different time for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the binary and winds parameters might be somewhat different than those we used .",
    "secondly , we did not take into account the winding of the conical shell ; we only considered the approximate direction of its axis by calculating the angle @xmath41 .",
    "thirdly , close to periastron the conical shell is likely to collapse onto the secondary ( soker 2005 ; kashi & soker 2009 ) .    with the only four available observations for the fitting , with the present possible degree of accuracy , and according to our parameters",
    ", we expect the maximum blue shifted absorption to occur @xmath90 before periastron passage , i.e. , late december or early january .",
    "there are two main reasons for that we can not be more accurate .",
    "firstly , we can not treat properly the conical shell as the system approach periastron .",
    "secondly , we expect the colliding wind region to collapse onto the secondary near periastron ; we did not consider this process here either .",
    "our fundamental assumption is that the absorber of the blue wing of the he  i  @xmath0 line resides in the conical shell formed by the colliding winds .",
    "this assumption works quite well with the semimajor orientation @xmath74 , where the secondary is closest to the observer at periastron passage .",
    "we now show that other orientations that are popular in the literature can not account , not even qualitatively , for the behavior of the blue wing , if our fundamental assumption holds .",
    "we followed the calculations presented in figure [ fig : abs ] , but for three different semimajor axis orientations , as drawn in figure [ fig : omega ] : @xmath91 : the semimajor axis is perpendicular to the line of sight and the secondary is closer to the observer before the event . @xmath92 : the semimajor axis is perpendicular to the line of sight and the secondary is closer to the observer after the event . @xmath93",
    ": the secondary is closest to the observer at apastron , opposite to our favorite orientation of @xmath74 ( figure [ fig : abs ] ) .",
    "the results for the expected doppler shifts of the absorption wing are presented in figure [ fig : otheromega ] , together with the fours observations from damineli et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "it is clear that none of the other orientations can account for the observed absorption wing , not even qualitatively and just for the two early observations .",
    "we study the blue absorption wing of the he  i  @xmath0 p cygni profile of @xmath1 car .",
    "the two winds of the two stars collide , and the post shocked gas of the two winds flow on both sides of a surface ( the discontinuity surface ) that has a pseudo - conical structure : the conical shell .",
    "the shocked secondary s wind accelerates part of the shocked primary s wind to high velocity ( figure [ fig : colliding ] ) .",
    "this gas , and the segments of the shocked secondary s wind which cool to a low temperature near the contact discontinuity ( figure [ fig : colliding ] ) , are assumed to be responsible for the blue absorption wing .",
    "this is the fundamental assumption of our model .",
    "we use our previous results and assume an orientation where the secondary is toward the observer at periastron ( @xmath74 ; see figure [ fig : omega ] ) . for the conical shell we built a toy model ( figure [ fig : cone ] ) .    the absorption profile , up to a scaling factor ,",
    "is calculated according to equations ( [ eq : sum ] ) and ( [ eq : i ] ) , and the results are presented in figure [ fig : abs ] .",
    "we are interested in the bluest part of the absorption profile , where intensity is lower ; in our scaled units these are the contours in the range @xmath94 .",
    "using our fundamental assumption , and a toy model for the conical shell of the colliding winds , we showed that with our orbital orientation we can account for the appearance of the wide blue wing several months before periastron .",
    "other semimajor orientations @xmath73 , can not reproduce the results under our fundamental assumption ( figure [ fig : otheromega ] ) this is our main result , namely , that if the absorber responsible for the blue wing of the he  i  @xmath0 line reside in the winds collision region , then only the @xmath95 can account for the blue wing of this line .",
    "our results also predict that the doppler shift @xmath67 ( the edge of the profile ) will reach a maximum @xmath96 before periastron passage . since close to periastron the conical shell starts to collapse onto the primary , and even before it experiences the effect of wrapping , it is hard to pinpoint the exact time of this maximum . nevertheless this maximum should be observed before the event .",
