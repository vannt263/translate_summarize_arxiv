    "the first charmonium state @xmath6 was discovered in 1974  @xcite . then in six years nine more @xmath7  states were observed .",
    "no new states were found during next 22 years , until in 2002 belle reported the detection of @xmath2  @xcite . in 2003 belle discovered @xmath8  @xcite , which marked the beginning of `` exotic '' , or unconventional charmonium - like states era .",
    "such states decay in ways , peculiar to usual charmonium , but have masses , widths , quantum numbers and decay ratios , which can hardly be explained by the classical quark - parton model . since then two conventional and more than dozen `` exotic '' charmonium states were reported .",
    "comprehensive review of their characteristics , possible explanations etc can be found in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report some recent experimental results on this topic from @xmath0-factories .",
    "although @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been around for some time and studied by different experiments , there is still large spread in their mass and width measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our knowledge of hadronic decays of these charmonia is rather poor . both belle and babar performed recently new measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 characteristics .",
    "babar claimed that @xmath9 is the `` right place '' for such study since breit - wigner line shape is appropriate approximation here  @xcite . with data set of @xmath10 mass and width of @xmath1",
    "were measured relative to @xmath11 . in the same paper transition form factor in @xmath12 decay",
    "was measured and nice agreement with pqcd was observed .",
    "babar also reported mass and width measurement of @xmath2 in the same production process  @xcite .",
    "belle took another approach .",
    "they studied @xmath13 , @xmath14 decay chain and consistently took into account interference between decay under study and nonresonant decay into the same final state  @xcite .",
    "results , obtained with and without interference are quite different , which means that taking it into account is important .    until recently only one decay mode of @xmath2 was known , @xmath15 .",
    "decays to 4-prong final state have not been observed  @xcite .",
    "belle with 923studied decays to 6-prong final states : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 , as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , were clearly seen in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 distributions .",
    "babar looked at @xmath22 invariant mass spectrum from @xmath23  process and found @xmath2 signal , as well as @xmath1 , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8  was discovered by belle as a narrow peak in @xmath24 invariant mass from @xmath25 decays  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed by cdf  @xcite , d0  @xcite and babar  @xcite . among newly observed `` exotic '' charmonium - like states",
    "@xmath8  is the most studied one .",
    "it has very small width @xmath26 at 90%cl for a state above open charm threshold .",
    "its mass is very close to @xmath27 threshold , @xmath28 . in decays to @xmath24 invariant mass of @xmath29 pair",
    "is consistent with originating from @xmath30 , indicating @xmath31 parity of @xmath8 .",
    "since all charmonia are isospin singlets , decays to @xmath32 violate isospin and should be strongly suppressed .",
    "cdf studied angular distributions in @xmath33 decay and concluded that possible @xmath34 assignments for @xmath8  are @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "there are several unoccupied charmonium levels with appropriate quantum numbers but their predicted masses are either too high ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) or too low ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the whole set of @xmath8  characteristics also makes it hard to describe @xmath8  as a conventional charmonium .",
    "proximity of @xmath8  mass to @xmath27 threshold led to a suggestion , that it may be a molecule - like @xmath27 bound state  @xcite .    weighty argument in distinguishing between different possibilities are radiative decays @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath8  is a charmonium state @xmath37 , partial with of @xmath43 decay should be larger than that of @xmath42 by more than factor of ten  @xcite . in case of molecular state or",
    "@xmath39 the situation is reversed and @xmath44 mode is favoured  @xcite .",
    "the first evidence for @xmath42 by belle was based on @xmath45 with @xmath46  events  @xcite and was confirmed by babar on @xmath47 with @xmath48  events  @xcite .",
    "observation of this channel confirmed even parity of @xmath8 . in 2009",
    "babar reported evidence of @xmath41 based on @xmath47 with @xmath49 signal events ( @xmath50 )  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ xrad ] , ( a ) ) .",
    "the signal yield implied @xmath51 .",

    "[ xrad ] , ( b ) , ( c ) ) , while @xmath44 mode was observed at a rate that agrees with babar  @xcite .",
    "belle set a 90%cl upper limit on the @xmath53 ratio of @xmath54 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "three states with masses close to 3940  were found : @xmath55  @xcite , @xmath56  @xcite and @xmath57  @xcite , the latter usually identified with @xmath58 .",
    "these three states are considered to be distinct particles , though there is no decisive evidence for this . @xmath56",
    "mass is well above @xmath59 and @xmath60 thresholds , but the partial width of decay to hidden charm is unexpectedly large : @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "belle studied untagged two - photon process @xmath62 with 694  of data , collected at @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 resonances . a state with @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "was found  @xcite , compatible with @xmath56 . if it is so , it narrows its quantum numbers @xmath34 to @xmath68 or @xmath69 . measured partial width @xmath70 ( for @xmath71 ) . if @xmath72 , a typical value for charmonium , then @xmath73 , which is very large for a hadronic inter - charmonium transition .    though mass of @xmath8  is too small for decay to @xmath74 , in some models it may decay to low - mass tail of the @xmath75 and @xmath11  with a rate , comparable to decay @xmath76  @xcite . in 2005 belle reported an evidence for subthreshold decay @xmath77 , consistent with the prediction  @xcite . in 2008",
    "babar studied @xmath0-decay @xmath78 and in mass distribution of @xmath79 observed @xmath56 , but did not find @xmath8  @xcite . in 2010",

    "both @xmath56 and @xmath8  were observed with masses and widths , consistent with previous measurements .",
    "babar also investigated the shape of @xmath80 invariant mass distribution for selected @xmath77 events .",
    "they found that it favours @xmath81-wave description by @xmath82 ( @xmath83 for @xmath84-wave , @xmath85 for @xmath81-wave ) , which indicates @xmath86 for @xmath8 , which thus may be interpreted as @xmath87 charmonium state .",
    "however , possible interference between different decays , contributing to @xmath79 final state , was not taken into account , and explanation of significant rate of @xmath88 would be a challenge for @xmath87  @xcite .",

    "no prediction exists for allowed excited or `` exotic '' states , like @xmath8 .",
    "the photon detection required @xmath96 , which corresponded to @xmath97 mass of a particle , produced in @xmath90 radiative decay .",
    "initial state radiation ( isr ) was removed by requirement on photon polar angle .",
    "isr production of @xmath98 in @xmath99 channel was used as a cross - check , and the cross section for this process was determined as @xmath100 , in agreement with theoretical calculation .",
