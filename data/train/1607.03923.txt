    "therefore , in our opinion , cosmology that uses nled possesses some attractive features .",
    "the proposal of the paper is to show that nonlinear electromagnetic radiation which is described by modified maxwell s equations is a source of the universe inflation . to explain the universe acceleration one can introduce the cosmological constant , @xmath2 , in einstein s equation or to introduce a scalar field with some potential function or to modify the gravity theory with the help of some function @xmath3 .",
