    "the so - called eit wave@xcite is a propagating intensity enhancement in coronal euv lines , notably in fe  xii lines around 195    at @xmath01.5  mk .",
    "its discovery by the _ extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( eit ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) sparked renewed interest in global disturbances that had been associated with solar flares .",
    "the most typical example of such disturbances is the moreton - ramsey wave in h@xmath1 images @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled moreton - ramsey waves as chromospheric intersections of flare - launched fast - mode mhd waves in the corona , where the magnetoacoustic speed is an order of 1000  km  s@xmath2 , comparable to the typical speed of moreton - ramsey waves . the same fast - mode mhd waves may be responsible for metric type ii radio bursts and filament oscillations that had been found even earlier .",
    "eit waves were initially thought to be the coronal counterparts of moreton - ramsey waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , this idea started to be questioned . first",
    ", the typical speed of eit waves ( 200400  km  s@xmath2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much lower than that of moreton - ramsey waves . a magnetoacoustic speed that matches the eit wave initially implied a high plasma @xmath3 @xcite , not usually applicable in the low corona , although later works @xcite have shown that this is not always the case .",
    "second , eit waves are more intimately associated with coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) than with flares @xcite , whereas the mhd waves responsible for moreton - ramsey waves are often attributed to flares as were in uchida s original concept in the pre - cme era .",
    "third , some of the reported eit waves appear to represent stationary brightening @xcite .",
    "one way of interpreting these properties of eit waves is that they are not fast - mode mhd waves , but that they are signatures more directly related to cmes .",
    "they include current shells @xcite , stretched cme loops @xcite , and reconnection of cmes with quiet - sun bipoles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , slow mode waves @xcite and solitons @xcite were also proposed as contributors to eit waves .",
    "however , it is still more common to interpret eit waves in terms real waves , fast - mode mhd waves in particular . in certain events observed in h@xmath1 , soft x - rays , he  i  @xmath4  10830 and radio ( at both microwave and metric wavelengths ) ,",
    "the tracks of the eit wave fronts are found to be consistent with flare - generated large - amplitude mhd waves that undergo deceleration @xcite .",
    "other characteristics that support the wave nature of eit waves include the fronts that decelerate @xcite , broaden and decrease in amplitude with time @xcite , and deflect at coronal hole boundaries @xcite .",
    "it appears that the lack of a consensus view of the eit wave is due partly to the lack of its definition beyond `` the outermost propagating intensity front reaching global scales '' @xcite .",
    "another major factor is the 1020 minute cadence of eit , which likely failed to capture the early phase of many events , where the speed may have been higher .",
    "indeed , higher speeds and decelerating profiles were obtained using data from the _ extreme ultraviolet imager _",
    "( euvi ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _",
    "( stereo ) , which have slightly better cadence ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note , however , that the maximum speed found by long et al . was only 475 km s@xmath2 partly because of solar minimum conditions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an extensive list of eit waves observed by euvi during 20072009 ) .",
    "despite the problems arising from the low cadence , our knowledge of eit waves is still built heavily on a limited set of eit observations , especially on the list of events during march 1997june 1998 as compiled by @xcite .",
    "one remarkable departure in recent years , however , is a growing recognition that eit waves could contain both wave and cme - related components as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this change of our perception is driven by advanced 3d mhd numerical simulations for a few events @xcite rather more than by observations .",
    "observationally , it is clear that a breakthrough in understanding global coronal disturbances , eit waves included , should come with the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ , which provides uninterrupted full disk images with unprecedented high cadence , high sensitivity and broad temperature coverage .",
    "already more than 30 papers using aia data have been published that include discussions of eit waves , delivering some promising results . however , almost all the published papers on eit waves using aia data have so far been case studies of one or a few events , not answering how special they are , reflecting their specific processes or conditions .    in this paper , we take a complementary approach of studying a large sample of events that look like eit waves in aia images , and focus on their speeds .",
    "this is motivated primarily by the recent attempt of distinguishing three populations of eit waves on the basis of their kinematic behaviors @xcite . according to warmuth & mann , fast and decelerating eit waves",
    "may correspond to non - linear fast - mode mhd waves ( shocks ) , and those with moderate and constant speeds to linear fast - mode mhd waves propagating at the local fast - mode speed .",
    "the slowest eit waves may correspond to cme - related magnetic reconfiguration . after studying similar phenomena in aia data ,",
    "however , it appears that eit observations did not capture the full range of global disturbances in the corona largely because of the poor cadence . with aia",
    ", we can more clearly observe how they propagate in short time intervals that used to be covered by less than a few eit images .",
    "it is likely that we now deal with phenomena not adequately represented by `` eit waves . ''",
    "therefore in this paper we use the term `` large - scale coronal propagating fronts '' ( lcpfs ) to refer to eit - wave - like phenomena , as temporally resolved in aia data .",
    " 2 describes how we find lcpfs and maintain a catalog . in ",
    "3 we discuss how lcpfs are associated with other solar transient phenomena .",
    "we discuss the propagation speeds of lcpfs in  4 .",
    "the implications of this study are discussed in  4 .",
    "we have found 171 lcpfs during april 2010january 2013 . as of this writing , the software to automatically detect and characterize eit waves has not yet been implemented in aia data pipeline as part of the computer vision for the sdo ( cf .",
    "therefore we basically need to rely on visual inspection of images to find lcpfs . as a first step , we review running difference images in 211   , 193   , and 171    channels at a sampling of every five minutes , using a high - performance image - viewing tool called panorama @xcite .",
    "this exercise results in more than 200 candidates of lcpfs . in the absence of a universal and quantitative definition of eit waves ,",
    "our working definition of lcpfs is that they need to exhibit an angular expanse of @xmath545@xmath6 and to propagate at least 200  mm away from the center of the associated eruption . for each of the candidates",
    ", we measure the width and distance of the front in the last 193    difference image on which it can be traced .",
    "we use euvi 195    images to measure the width and distance of the front that comes from a region close to the limb and propagates predominantly along the limb , leaving almost negligible signatures on disk . for the period of interest , limb events from earth are typically viewed as disk events by one or both of the stereo spacecraft . after dropping the candidates that do not meet the above criteria , we are left with 171 lcpfs .",
    "they are listed in table  1 .    in order to study the global properties of lcpfs such as their relations with cmes , we need to analyze full - disk images .",
    "considering our event sample size , it is not realistic at the moment to conduct an analysis in the full - resolution images of 4096@xmath7 pixels .",
    "thus they are rebinned to 1024@xmath7 pixels for the present work .",
    "our experiences have shown that movies of coaligned images are extremely useful for following the spatio - temporal variations of dynamic phenomena on the sun .",
    "therefore , for each lcpf , we make standard solarsoft movies ( javascript and mpeg ) in aia s seven euv channels and three formats ( intensity , running difference and base difference ) .",
    "additionally , to benefit from stereoscopic views , two other sets of movies are made of aia 193    and stereo - a or -b euvi 195    pairs .",
    "it is also important to follow lcpfs with respect to the development of the associated flares as captured in soft x - ray light curves .",
    "to accommodate goes soft x - ray light curves in the movies , we further shrink the images to 768@xmath7 pixels , although images of 1024@xmath7 pixels are used when measuring lcpfs (  4 ) .",
    "lcpfs are usually found in running difference movies , but base difference movies are useful for isolating long - lasting dimming , which may correlate with the spatial extent of the cme @xcite .",
    "intensity movies , in which strong lcpfs are visible , also help us locate coronal holes and active regions that deflect lcpfs .",
    "the catalog of lcpfs with all these movies are online at http://aia.lmsal.com/aia_waves/index.html , which may contain more events over time that are not used in the present study .    out of the 171 lcpfs ,",
    "138 are seen to propagate across the solar disk , and 22 ( mostly from regions close to the limb ) to propagate predominantly over the limb without clear fronts on disk .",
    "the remaining 11 events do not show a clear front in either way , although future image processing techniques may restore it . in the following sections , even though a number of recent studies have examined propagations over the limb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our emphasis here is on the first category , since many scientists may have associated eit waves with circular fronts propagating across the disk .",
    "we study the association of the 138 lcpfs that propagate across the solar disk with solar flares , cmes and type ii radio bursts , following a past study by @xcite for the eit waves that were compiled by @xcite . in table",
    "1 , they are given in the third , ninth and tenth columns .",
    "the goes x - ray peak flux of the associated flares and the presence of type ii bursts are easily available from noaa lists or solarsoft distributions .",
    "however , the same may not apply to cmes because the online cme catalogs tend to contain as many events as possible , some of which may be too insignificant to qualify as cmes . rather than simply showing whether the lcpf is associated with a cme as found close in time in a catalog ,",
    "we differentiate the significance of cmes or outflows into four levels similar to the flare magnitude which is often referred to as x - class and so on . by examining the available coronagraph data ( cor-1 and cor-2 on stereo and lasco on soho ) , we introduce the following cme levels ; ( 1 ) weak outflow that becomes invisible before the heliocentric distance of 5  r@xmath8 , ( 2 ) narrow ( @xmath960@xmath6 ) or slow ( @xmath9500 km s@xmath2 ) outflow traceable beyond 5  r@xmath8 , but typically not being reminiscent of the three - part cme structure , ( 3 ) well - formed cme , fast and wide , with a flux rope or three - part structure , ( 4 ) similar to level 3 , but very fast ( @xmath101500 km s@xmath2 ) .    separating the cmes into groups may not be done completely objectively , which is especially true for the distinction between cmes of levels 3 and 4 , as many different threshold speeds could be considered .",
    "nevertheless , we consider a grouping like this to be important when we understand how lcpfs arise in the overall picture of sudden energy release in the solar corona .",
    "@xcite criticized careless use of the term `` cme '' to include coronal structures that are not part of the flux rope . here",
    "we propose that how far it can travel may be another criterion for a cme .",
    "table  2 shows the breakdown into the flare class of the cme levels defined in this way and the presence / absence of a type ii burst . flares",
    "whose peak flux is @xmath910@xmath11  w m@xmath12 are labeled `` @xmath9c . '' to our surprise , more than 1/3 of our lcpfs belong to cme level 1 , given the strong correlation of eit waves with cmes as widely accepted @xcite .",
    "although we observe at least a minor outflow in the coronagraph data of almost all of our lcpfs , many of them may not be real cmes defined as ejections of coronal magnetized plasma into the heliosphere .",
    "the speeds of the 138 lcpfs that propagate across the disk are measured in 193    images ( figure  1 ) , using a semi - automated scheme . as the first step ,",
    "we de - rotate the images to a reference time in order to compensate for differential solar rotation , using the standard solarsoft routine ` drot_map.pro ` . the reference time is typically set to be 510  minutes before the onset of the associated flare . then ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , we follow a technique that is widely used for tracing waves ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* who developed the novel eit wave machine observing ( nemo ) code ) .",
    "first , the eruption center is identified as a pole .",
    "here we make 24 equally spaced longitude sectors from the pole that are 15@xmath6 wide .",
    "for each sector the intensity profile is obtained as a function of the distance along the longitude , by averaging pixels in the latitudinal direction .",
    "this corrects for the curvature of the solar surface .",
    "such a profile is obtained at the cadence of 12  s ( or 24  s after october 2010 ) .",
    "the images with automatic exposure control are excluded to avoid spurious effects in difference images irrespective of which events we deal with .",
    "we now have a 2d array of intensity as a function of both time and distance from the eruption center .",
    "this should contain useful information on the front such as the amplitude and width @xcite",
    ". however , extraction of such information may not be straightforward on a large sample , because it can be affected by local conditions specific to individual events . in this paper",
    "we instead concentrate on the simplest quantity , namely the propagation speed , which is measured on a distance - time plot . in figure  1 , we show distance - time plots for all the sectors as running difference images , on which lcpfs appear as bright ridges . we also include the normalized goes 18    soft x - ray flux as plotted on the same time axis .    for each sector , we calculate the speed and acceleration by fitting first- and second - order polynomials to the front edge of the most prominent ridge in the distance - time plot .",
    "mpfit @xcite is used to calculate these parameters with error bars , assuming a uniform uncertainty of 5  mm in locating the front .",
    "this is done only in the distance range until the propagation is clearly altered by active regions or coronal holes . beyond this range",
    ", the technique may not make sense because we are probably not tracing the same front .",
    "furthermore , the technique may not work as well in data whose temporal resolution is much worse than that of aia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in intensity images (",
    "not shown ) , active regions are seen in the sectors 13 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 21 , 23 and 24 and coronal holes in sectors 1217 , where the main ridge shows clear deceleration .",
    "we examine the distance - time plot in each sector and select the one with the highest speed , making sure not to select a sector in which the measurement is too susceptible to foreshortening toward the limb . in this case sector 4",
    "is selected , and the speed measured in that sector is registered as the speed of this lcpf ( see the sixth and seventh columns in table  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows distance - time plots from images in 171   . generally , the fronts are harder to trace . moreover , they appear as depression in several sectors rather than as intensity enhancement .",
    "this may indicate heating at the fronts @xcite , for example , from @xmath131  mk to @xmath01.5  mk . in this example",
    ", the front in sector  4 still appears as intensity enhancement .",
    "the eighth column in table  1 shows the appearance of the front in 171    channel , summarized in the last three columns in table  2 . in 171    images , 42% of lcpfs",
    "are not clearly seen ( below the noise level ) in the sector of the fastest front at 193    and another 42% are seen as intensity depression .",
    "let us discuss the 22 lcpfs that propagate predominantly over the limb .",
    "we measure their speeds along the limb at the heliocentric distance of 1.15  r@xmath8 , as shown in figure  3 . in figure",
    "4 , they are compared with the speeds measured in euvi 195    images of the same lcpfs in the same directions ( north or south ) viewed as disk events .",
    "the error bars for the speeds from aia are based on the uniform uncertainty of locating the front to 5  mm .",
    "it is more difficult to measure the speeds of faster lcpfs in euvi data , given the 2.55  m cadence .",
    "therefore the error bars for the speeds from euvi are essentially proportional to the speeds with other corrections due to the cadence and the visibility of the fronts , which may be still tentative .",
    "irrespective of the error bars , figure  4 indicates that the two speeds are not well correlated . in many events ,",
    "the aia speed is higher than the euvi speed , presumably reflecting the difference in the cadence ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but other lcpfs show the opposite trend , suggesting that the limb view of lcpfs after all reflect line - of - sight integration of the fronts whose propagations may not only be in the north - south directions but also in other directions .",
    "although it may be worthwhile to investigate reasons ( e.g. , projection effect ) for the discrepancy of the speeds in individual cases , we generally argue that these events may not be directly comparable to the lcpfs that are seen to propagate across the solar disk in aia images .    for the 138 lcpfs that are seen to propagate across the solar disk ,",
    "we get @xmath14=644  km s@xmath2 and @xmath15=607  km s@xmath2 , which are much higher than the typical speed of eit waves ( 200400  km s@xmath2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "figure  5 shows the speed vs acceleration of these lcpfs .",
    "up to @xmath16800  km  s@xmath2 , there may be a weak trend of faster lcpfs decelerating as was the case for eit waves @xcite .",
    "however , in the full speed range , acceleration is distributed more or less around zero .",
    "this is partly because we fit the distance vs time only until the propagation is clearly altered by active regions or coronal holes .",
    "furthermore , there seems no difference in the speed vs acceleration pattern when the lcpf is associated or not associated with a type ii burst .",
    "figure  6 shows the distribution of linear speed with respect to the flare class , cme level ( see the previous section ) , association with type ii bursts and appearance of the front at 171   . on average",
    "the speed appears to be correlated with these observables .",
    "higher speeds are seen in intense flares and energetic cmes , and when type ii bursts are associated and the 171    front appears in intensity enhancement .",
    "this is summarized in the average and median speeds for each of the observables .",
    "however , the distribution is broad and it is possible to find high - speed lcpfs without the above properties .",
    "lastly , we compare the speeds of lcpfs and cmes ( or outflows ) observed by cor-1 in the heliocentric distance range of ( 1.54)r@xmath8 , for a subset of 86 events for which the source region is located limbward of 60@xmath6 longitude from either or both stereo spacecraft .",
    "the speeds measured in this view may be closer to the true cme speeds because they are less susceptible to projection and visibility effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure 7(b ) gives an example of the distance - time or height - time plot of a cme along the cut as shown in figure  7(a ) .",
    "we make sure that the cut passes both the lcpf as projected on the limb and the dominant direction of cme propagation . in figure  8",
    "we compare the speeds of 86 lcpfs and associated cmes ( or outflows ) as observed by cor-1 as limb events .",
    "we assume the uncertainty of 25  mm in locating the cme front ( figure  7(b ) ) .",
    "the two speeds do not seem to be strongly correlated , irrespective of whether the lcpf is associated with a type ii burst .",
    "we have found 171 lcpfs during april 2010january 2013 by manually inspecting aia images , and made an online catalog of lcpfs .",
    "this is not meant to be a complete catalog , but we believe that most `` major '' lcpfs have been included . some minor events discussed by @xcite are not included in table  1 because of our working definition of lcpf that it should be @xmath1045@xmath6 wide and be observed more than 200  mm away from the eruption center . the last column in table  1 shows the references so far published to discuss the individual lcpfs either directly or indirectly . to date a small number of relatively old events have been studied .",
    "as captured in the movies included in the catalog , lcpfs have widely different appearances , many of which are not circular , as was thought to be `` typical '' for eit waves ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "some lcpfs appear predominantly over the limb as seen in aia images . here",
    "we do not discuss them because the speeds obtained by euvi in disk view are sometimes far from those measured by aia along the limb , although such limb events have been used in the context of the numerical simulations that have helped us recognize the coexistence of wave and cme - related components @xcite .",
    "some events close to the limb may even show more radial motions than lateral , marginally producing lcpfs ( e.g. , 2010 august 1 event , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is to be seen how these `` untypical '' events will be included in the automatic detection software being developed .",
    "such software should make it easier to conduct ensemble studies of lcpfs on more involved parameters .",
    "this study may help validate the software .",
    "it is widely accepted that eit waves are more intimately associated with cmes than with flares @xcite . in many lcpfs , however , the associated cmes are quite insignificant , suggesting that the processes close to the sun that allow fast lateral expansion seems to be a key for certain lcpfs @xcite . however , it is not clear whether such processes accompany all cmes and the height of their occurrences possibly determines lcpf detection . they are certainly not part of flare processes , since for many lcpfs the associated flares are less intense than the goes c - class .",
    "it is thus important to understand how the lateral expansion starts .",
    "the present study primarily deals with the global properties in 4@xmath174 rebinned full - disk images , with the pixel resolution comparable to that of eit . on that scale",
    ", we can easily miss out important changes within active regions that may directly indicate lateral expansions .",
    "unlike eit , however , we can go back to the full resolution zooming into the active region and immediate neighborhood , where , in combination with vector magnetic field data from the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _",
    "( hmi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we may be able to observe the first signatures of the lateral expansion .",
    "in other words , this information may help us understand the range of variations in how solar eruptions occur .    even though there were criticisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the idea of deflection of eit waves at coronal holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , aia data show that such deflections or alterations of the front are quite common at non - quiet - sun magnetic field elements .",
    "movies included in our online catalog of lcpfs as described in  2 immediately show us how lcpfs propagate outside quiet - sun regions .",
    "it is likely that these deflections and subsequent propagations indicate that they are fast - mode mhd waves , which at greater distances likely represent freely propagating waves . in this work",
    "the speeds of lcpfs are measured before they encounter active regions or coronal holes and get deflected .",
    "it is in this early stage that lcpfs are poorly understood .",
    "models indicate that in the early development of lcpfs the waves are not easily separable from cme loops @xcite .",
    "observationally , we may see both components @xcite .",
    "further progress requires more detailed analysis of the kinematics ( including the amplitude and width of the front , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thermodynamic properties , and runs of mhd simulations in wider parameter space than what have been done for relatively modest eruptions @xcite .    as in figure  5",
    ", we fail to confirm distinct kinematic properties as found by @xcite in eit and euvi data that may indicate their different origins .",
    "this is partly because our measurements are restricted to the early stages of lcpfs . in other words , in at least a number of cases , the apparent deceleration of eit waves probably resulted from deflection by coronal holes or active regions at large distances . in the past",
    ", several examples of deceleration were found by comparing the trajectories of eit waves with those of faster waves observed in other wavelengths such as h@xmath1 , soft x - rays , he  i  @xmath4  10830 , and radio .",
    "it is possible that eit waves observed in other wavelengths represent a subset of `` strong '' events , and that aia has observed only a few of them .",
    "indeed , we know of only two moreton - ramsey waves since sdo launch ( * ? ? ?",
    "* white , 2012 , personal communication ) , but it is possible that we may find more with more extensive search .",
    "now waves in other wavelengths can be directly compared with lcpfs without extrapolation in time .",
    "such comparisons will be useful for further clarifying the relation between the wave and cme components in lcpfs in the early phase and probing the origin of large - amplitude fast mhd waves .",
    "the sharpness of the front may also be useful for answering these questions , since in the past `` sharp '' waves accompanied eit waves observed in multiple wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the association of lcpfs with moreton - ramsey waves and type ii bursts may also depend on the angle of the propagating front with respect to the solar surface that can affect the downward pressure and the shock geometry important for particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "we find in figure  6 some correlation between the speeds of lcpfs and indicators for the magnitude of eruption or energy release .",
    "however the correlation is not strong .",
    "there is an expectation that the correlation could be made tighter if the magnitude of energy release were more properly formulated such as using the x - ray fluence rather than the peak flux  which may not be trivial especially for small flares , but it is more likely that the occurrence and speed of lcpfs depend on the external conditions rather than the energy release mechanism .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a small number of active regions are very prolific in lcpfs ( see table  1 ) .    in this study",
    "we do not deal with lcpfs at greater distances beyond surrounding active regions and coronal holes .",
    "it appears that such lcpfs may be freely propagating mhd waves .",
    "they may still play an important role in acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in sympathetic flares and eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for these questions , we need to analyze data in longer time ranges beyond individual lcpfs , and the 360@xmath6 view of the sun made by combining aia and euvi data @xcite would be extremely useful .",
    "many papers have posed questions like `` what is the nature of eit waves ? '' as if a single scheme could explain the phenomena in a unified way even though different examples appear to have widely different properties .",
    "it is more productive to characterize individual lcpfs to understand when , where and how both wave and cme components appear @xcite .",
    "this study may help to put into perspective the individual lcpfs that will be studied in detail .",

    "<S> this paper presents a study of a large sample of global disturbances in the solar corona with characteristic propagating fronts as intensity enhancement , similar to the phenomena that have often been referred to as eit waves or euv waves . </S>",
    "<S> now extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) images obtained by the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) provide a significantly improved view of these large - scale coronal propagating fronts ( lcpfs ) . between april 2010 and january 2013 </S>",
    "<S> , a total of 171 lcpfs have been identified through visual inspection of aia images in the 193    channel . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the 138 lcpfs that are seen to propagate across the solar disk , first studying how they are associated with flares , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and type ii radio bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the speed of the lcpf in various directions until it is clearly altered by active regions or coronal holes . </S>",
    "<S> the highest speed is extracted for each lcpf . </S>",
    "<S> it is often considerably higher than eit waves . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a pattern where faster lcpfs decelerate and slow lcpfs accelerate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the speeds are not strongly correlated with the flare intensity or cme magnitude , nor do they show an association with type ii bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a good correlation either between the speeds of lcpfs and cmes in a subset of 86 lcpfs observed by one or both of the _ solar and terrestrial relations observatory _ </S>",
    "<S> ( stereo ) spacecraft as limb events . </S>"
