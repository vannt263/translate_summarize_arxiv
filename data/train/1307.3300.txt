    "the study of reversible photodegradation of dye - doped polymers began in the early 2000 s with the discovery of reversible photodegradation as measured with amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) from disperse orange 11 ( do11 ) doped into ( poly)methyl - methacrylate ( pmma)@xcite . since then , reversible photodegradation has been found in air force 455 ( af455)@xcite , rhodamine b and pyrromethene@xcite , as well as several anthraquinone derivatives@xcite .",
    "several methods have been used to probe the effect including ase@xcite , absorption spectroscopy@xcite , fluorescence@xcite , digital imaging microscopy@xcite , and two - photon fluorescence@xcite . in an effort to expand our ability to measure and understand reversible photodegradation ,",
    "we have developed a white light interferometric microscope ( wlim ) , which combines the absorption spectrometer s frequency resolution with digital imaging s spatial resolution . along with measuring a sample s absorption spectrum , the wlim measures the change in the real part of the index of refraction due to photodegradation .",
    "a wlim utilizes a michelson interferometer and a ccd detector to obtain spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "the method of using a michelson interferometer with a photodiode detector to obtain spectral information in the visible spectrum is well known . using a point detector ,",
    "michelson interferometers have been used to measure the complex index of refraction in glass@xcite , gases@xcite , and liquids@xcite .",
    "further , it has been used with some modifications in astronomy research@xcite and the study of surfaces@xcite .",
    "the idea of using a ccd as a detector for interferometry was demonstrated previously by pisani _ et .",
    "; they used a fabry - perot interferometer , which measured only the imaginary part of the index of refraction@xcite .",
    "our wlim is designed to spatially and spectrally resolve the photodamage induced change in the complex index of refraction of dye - doped polymer thin films .",
    "the wlim ( see figure [ fig : setup ] ) consists of a thorlabs solid state light source ( hpls-30 - 03 ) , a michelson interferometer , and an edmunds optics monochrome ccd ( eo 0813 m ) .",
    "the michelson interferometer is made up of a uvfs uncoated non - polarizing cubic beam splitter and two uncoated uvfs mirrors , one of which is mounted on a thorlabs piezo stage ( nf5dp20s ) with a piezo translation range of @xmath0 m .",
    "the piezo stage is controlled by a closed feedback loop controller from thorlabs ( bpz001 ) , allowing for nanometer translation precision .",
    "photodegradation of samples is induced using an arkr cw laser focused with a cylindrical lens , with two polarizers providing intensity control .",
    "control and data acquisition by computer uses the labview 2011 full development system , and the data is analyzed using custom procedures in igor pro .",
    "a michelson interferometer easily produces interference fringes when using a monochromatic laser with a coherence length of several meters .",
    "the process is far more complicated when utilizing white light , which typically has a coherence length of the order of 40 - 60 @xmath1 m .",
    "the system is aligned first by optimizing the bulls - eye pattern from a hene laser beam that is collinear with the collimated white light .",
    "then , a differential micrometer is used to set the two arms of the interferometer within 1 mm of each other , at which point we scan the micrometer in intervals of approximately 30 @xmath1 m in order to find the zero path length difference , where a series of dark and light fringes form . the mirror alignment is subsequently adjusted so that the dark and light fringes change into a series of colorful fringes .",
    "after several iterations , a centered white light interference pattern forms .",
    "the ideal pattern is a bullseye shape with colorful fringes .",
    "since the optics have a minimum flatness of @xmath2 due to the beam splitter , the pattern produced is oval in shape .",
    "the wlim produces an intensity as a function of path length difference , @xmath3 , for each pixel of the camera , which can then be converted into the spectral intensity , @xmath4 , using a fourier transform ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the wavenumber in vacuum .",
    "the result of the fourier transform is the interference intensity , which can be written as a function of the electric field in each arm of the interferometer as    @xmath7    given an incident electric field amplitude , @xmath8 , the electric field in each arm can be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the arm , @xmath11 is the spectral response of the optics in arm @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the phase due to arm @xmath12 .",
    "assuming @xmath8 and @xmath11 are real quantities and substituting equation [ eqn : efield ] into equation [ eqn : iint ] we find the interference intensity to be    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the complex conjugate .      for the empty interferometer the zero path length difference phase , @xmath17 , in each arm can be written    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the balanced round trip arm length , and @xmath20 is a phase introduced by the optics and deviations from the plane - wave approximation . combining the phases , we find that for the empty interferometer the phase difference , @xmath21 , between the arms is    @xmath22      given the high optical density of dye - doped polymer samples and their relatively large index of refraction ( @xmath23 @xcite ) , we must place nearly identical samples in each arm to maintain fringe contrast .",
    "`` nearly identical '' means the samples compositions are identical such that their complex index of refraction is the same , but their thickness and roughness may be different .",
    "the zero path length difference phase of each arm is @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sample thickness , @xmath27 is the glass substrate thickness , @xmath28 is the real wavenumber of the glass where we assume the imaginary portion is negligible , @xmath29 is the complex wavenumber of the dye - doped polymer , and @xmath30 is a phase factor introduced due to the samples not being perfectly flat and aligned ; @xmath31 comes from the empty interferometer phase .",
    "combining phases and separating into the real , @xmath32 , and imaginary , @xmath33 , parts we find ,    @xmath34 + 2(a_2-a_1)\\left[k_g(k_0)-k_0\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "samples are prepared as follows ; pmma and 1,4-daaq purchased from sigma - aldrich are dissolved into a solution of 33% @xmath51-butyrolacetone and 67% propylene glycol methyl ether acetate . maintaining a ratio of 15% solids to 85% solvents ,",
    "we add the dye and polymer such that the concentration of dye in the polymer is 2.5g / l .",
    "the solution is then stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 24 hours to ensure the dye and polymer fully dissolve .",
    "afterwards the solution is filtered through a 0.2@xmath1 m acrodisc filter to remove any remaining solids .",
    "the glass substrates are prepared for spin coating by submerging plain glass slides in acetone to remove any residues from manufacturing , then placing the cleaned slides in deionized water and finally drying and storing them in a lint - free container to minimize contamination .",
    "once the dye - polymer solution is prepared , it is placed on a substrate and then spin coated at 1100 rpm for 90s .",
    "the spin coated sample is then placed in an oven overnight to dry and to allow solvents to evaporate .",
    "once the sample has cooled , it is cut in half to form two nearly identical 2 cm @xmath52 2 cm squares .",
    "when placing a sample in the interferometer for degradation , we use the two halves as a balanced pair in order to minimize differences between the sample arm and the attenuating arm of the interferometer .",
    "the experimental procedure is as follows .",
    "the white light source warms up for one hour before taking data to minimize fluctuations in the light source .",
    "next , a reference interferogram is produced using the empty interferometer and a translation step size of 20 nm , for a total number of 1000 steps . at each step ,",
    "the average of ten images is used in order to minimize noise from the ccd detector . once all the images are taken ,",
    "they are imported into igor pro , where a custom procedure finds the interferogram at each pixel and then takes the fft in order to find the phase and magnitude at each pixel .",
    "once the reference interferogram is taken , the sample and attenuator are mounted and the interferometer is realigned to compensate for wavefront distortion due to the samples not being perfectly homogeneous and flat .",
    "this adjustment is found to effect the measured phase but not the magnitude . given that we are typically only concerned with differences due to photodegradation , the absolute phase is unimportant .",
    "the pristine sample s interferogram is measured .",
    "subsequently , the sample is damaged using a pump laser with an average intensity of 60w/@xmath53 for two hours , then another interferogram is taken .",
    "finally , the sample is removed and another reference interferogram is taken to ensure the probe light has not drifted from its original intensity .    using the magnitude of the interferogram at each pixel without the samples , with the pristine sample , and after damaging , the absorbance before and after photodegradation is determined at each pixel . given that an individual pixel is noisy , an average over adjacent pixels is performed to find a binned absorbance value .",
    "the same averaging is applied to the phase data .",
    "since each pixel corresponds to a different point along the pump profile , spatial variations allow us to compare the change in absorbance and change in phase for different pump intensities .",
    "given that one of the primary goals of developing the wlim was to measure absorbance as a function of position and therefore intensity , the method is tested for each pixel by comparing the absorbance data for photodegradation measured with the wlim to results found with an ocean optics spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer accommodates thicker samples because of its greater dynamic range .",
    "this difference in samples means the absolute numbers will be different between our experiments , but the spectral shapes remain the same .",
    "figure [ fig : specabs ] shows spectrometer data at three times during photodegradation corresponding to different pump doses .",
    "figure [ fig : wlimabs ] shows the sum of the absorbance in each interferometer arm , @xmath54 , as measured by the wlim for the initial undamaged sample as well as the absorbance after decay at the burn center and @xmath55 position of the burn . a 4-peak gaussian fit of the wlim data represents the absorption spectrum and confirms the wlim result is consistent with spectrometer results .",
    "point of the burn profile and at the center of the burn profile . ]    for clarity , figure [ fig : wlimabs ] shows only the initial absorbance and two other points on the sample .",
    "absorbance measurements were taken at many points along the burn line and averaged .",
    "figure  [ fig : spacecomp ] shows the absorbance at @xmath56m@xmath57 , the peak of the spectrum , as a function of pixel transverse to the line . also shown is a profile of the burn line as imaged with an imaging microscope .",
    "the gaussian fit of both the absorbance sum and the line profile yield the same gaussian widths within experimental uncertainty , showing the wlim can spatially resolve the burn line .",
    "one of the benefits of interferometry as compared to ordinary spectroscopy is the ability to simultaneously measure both the real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction .",
