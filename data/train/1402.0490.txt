    "isotopy invariants of knots have a long history . of late",
    ", they have taken the form of multiply - graded chain complexes @xcite , with isotopies inducing quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "witten has provided a physical context for such invariants in gauge theory , whether they be numerical @xcite or `` categorified '' @xcite . in the context of legendrian knots",
    ", further invariants can distinguish legendrian isotopy classes within the same topological class .",
    "the classical legendrian invariants are the rotation number and the thurston - bennequin number , but the most powerful known invariant is the the chekanov - eliashberg differential graded algebra , distinguishing as it does pairs of knots with the same classical invariants . though it has a combinatorial description , the chekanov - eliashberg invariant @xcite and its higher - dimensional generalization legendrian contact homology @xcite have morse - floer - fukaya - theoretic descriptions in terms of holomorphic disks .",
    "this suggests a route from knot invariants to physics through open strings .",
    "one such route was taken in @xcite , where the authors begin with a topological knot in three - space and compute the legendrian contact homology of the associated legendrian torus , i.e. the unit conormal in the cosphere bundle of three - space . in this paper",
    "we explore another connection : by embedding the standard contact three - space into the cosphere bundle of the plane , we interpret a legendrian knot or link as living at infinity in the cotangent bundle of the plane . from this geometric set - up , we define a category : the fukaya category of the cotangent of the plane whose geometric objects are lagrangians asymptotic to the knot at infinity .",
    "microlocalzation  the relationship between the symplectic topology of a cotangent and the topology of the base manifold  affords us another perspective on this category . in its categorical form",
    ", microlocalization means that the fukaya category of the cotangent of the plane is equivalent to the category of constructible sheaves on the plane @xcite .",
    "our category is therefore equivalent to a category of sheaves on the plane , in fact sheaves constructible with respect to the stratification defined by the front diagram of the knot and satisfying some microlocal conditions . in this form ,",
    "hamiltonian invariance follows from the general work of guillermou - kashiwara - schapira @xcite . as a category of sheaves constructible with respect to a fixed stratification",
    ", the category also has a combinatorial , quiver - type description where invariance under reidemeister moves can be seen explicitly .",
    "one final perspective on this category is used to facilitate calculations , and this exploits the relationship between constructible sheaves and algebraic geometry : after isotoping the front diagram to a rectilinear ` grid diagram , ' the coherent - constructible correspondence of @xcite gives a description of the category in terms of modules over the polynomial ring in two variables .",
    "this means calculations in the category can easily be programmed into a computer .",
    "a fukaya category has a distinguished class of _ geometric objects _ : smooth lagrangians with flat line bundles , or local systems .",
    "the lagrangians in our category bound the knot at infinity in the cotangent of the plane , and rank - one local systems restrict at infinity to rank - one local systems on the knot .",
    "such legendrians are known to furnish one - dimensional representations , or ` augmentations ' , of the chekanov - eliashberg differential graded algebra @xcite .",
    "more generally , we conjecture that the augmentation category recently defined by bourgeois - chantraine @xcite is equivalent to the subcategory of rank - one objects of our category .    from the perspective of mirror symmetry , the moduli space of rank - one objects in our category  which we view to be the analogue in this context of special lagrangian branes",
    " is almost obligatory : it is a kind of mirror to the knot . due to the fact that a geometric deformation of a special lagrangian is related by the complex structure on moduli space to a deformation of a unitary local system , we think of an open set in this moduli space as being the character variety of a generic filling surface of the legendrian knot , i.e. one of maximal genus . whatever the heuristics , the study of these spaces and their structure gives evidence for the conjecture above , especially by comparison with the augmentation varieties constructed by henry - rutherford @xcite .",
    "central to the study of legendrian knots by their front diagrams is the notion of a ruling , a decomposition of the diagram into disks bounded on the left and right by cusps . in the sheaf - theoretic description of rank - one objects of our category",
    "we define the notion of a ruling filtration , i.e.  a filtration whose associated graded sheaves are supported on the disks of a ruling . much more can be said in the case that the knot is the  rainbow \" closure of a positive braid : the different rulings arising from ruling filtrations provide a stratification of the moduli space into pieces that have the same structural form as those found by henry - rutherford for the augmentation variety @xcite of the knot .",
    "it follows that the number of points on our moduli spaces over the finite field with @xmath1 elements is governed by the ruling polynomial of the braid closure .",
    "another theorem of rutherford @xcite identifies this expression with a _",
    "topological _ knot invariant  the polynomial in ` @xmath1 ' which is the lowest order term in ` @xmath2 ' of the homfly polynomial .",
    "this term of the homfly polynomial has appeared in recent work in the algebraic geometry of singular plane curves . specifically , the poincar polynomial of the perverse leray filtration on the cohomology of the compactified jacobian of a singular plane curve is equal to this term in the homfly polynomial of its link @xcite .",
    "these links are all closures of positive braids , so fit into our present story , and the result on the number of points on our moduli spaces in this case can be restated as asserting that the poincar polynomial of the weight filtration on their cohomology is equal to this term of the homfly polynomial .",
    "this identification between the perverse filtration on the cohomology of one space and the weight filtration on the cohomology of another has appeared before : precisely the same relation is conjectured to exist between the hitchin system and character variety of a smooth curve @xcite .",
    "we believe this to be no accident : the compactified jacobian of a singular plane curve should be the central fibre of a wild hitchin system .",
    "we conjecture that the corresponding @xcite wild character variety is essentially our moduli space of constructible sheaves with singular support in the natural legendrian presentation of its link .",
    "we make some remarks on avenues of exploration implicit in this conjecture .",
    "it suggests a new perspective on the wild character varieties , and conversely that the intriguing structures of @xcite may be found in our moduli spaces as well .",
    "it also suggests that the constructions of @xcite may have counterparts on our side : we may be able to produce the action of the spherical rational cherednik algebra of type - a on the cohomology of the moduli space of legendrian branes ending on a torus knot , and perhaps in the present context , the operators will arise from the geometry of legendrian knots .",
    "finally , in the context of the conjectures of @xcite , it suggests that for braid closures which give the links of plane curve singularities , the cohomology of our moduli space is a certain piece of the khovanov - rozansky @xcite triply - graded knot homology .",
    "in fact , we find a somewhat more complicated , but rigorous and more general , relation to the khovanov - rozansky homology . if we close up a positive braid by wrapping it around a cylinder , then the moduli spaces in this case are constructed from open bott - samelson - type spaces over the flag variety .",
    "the same spaces arise in webster - williamson s @xcite geometric construction of the khovanov - rozansky invariants , which means the category we construct gives a route to these categorified knot invariants . in some more detail ,",
    "the moduli spaces of sheaves have a geometrically induced map to the adjoint quotient of the general linear group , obtained by restricting the sheaf to the top of the cylinder , where it is a local system on a circle .",
    "the map induces a weight filtration on cohomology , and the khovanov - rozansky invariants are the second page of the associated spectral sequence .",
    "we continue now with precise statements of the key results of this paper .",

    "the cosphere bundle @xmath5 is naturally a contact manifold ; let @xmath6 be a legendrian submanifold .",

    "using general results of guillermou , kashiwara , and schapira @xcite , we show in section [ sec : invariance ] :    [ thm : introinvariance ] a contactomorphism inducing a legendrian isotopy induces a quasi - equivalence @xmath10    henceforth we take @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "it is convenient to restrict to those objects which have acyclic stalks for @xmath13 ; we denote the full subcategory of such objects by @xmath14  the equivalence preserves this subcategory .    in section [ sec : mishmash",
    "] , we show that fixing a maslov potential on the front diagram of @xmath9 determines a functor @xmath15 to local systems ( of complexes of @xmath4-modules up to quasi - isomorphism ) on the knot @xmath9 .",
    "define the `` subcategory of rank-@xmath16 objects '' @xmath17 with moduli space @xmath18 by setting @xmath19    the construction of @xmath20 reveals    [ prop : norot ] if @xmath9 has rotation number @xmath16 , then every element of @xmath21 is periodic with period @xmath22 ; in particular , if @xmath23 , then there are no bounded complexes of sheaves in @xmath24 .",

    "some maslov potentials relieve us of the need to work with homological algebra , dg - categories , etc :    when the front diagram of @xmath9 carries a maslov potential taking only the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 , then every element of @xmath28 is quasi - isomorphic to it s zeroeth cohomology sheaf",

    "it is well known that @xmath39 only depends on the braid @xmath40 and not on its expression ; this also follows from theorem [ thm : introinvariance ] and    let @xmath41 be a positive braid",
    ". then @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the open bott - samelson variety does not depend on much at all ; it is an iterated affine space bundle .",

    ". then the homfly homology of @xmath9 colored by @xmath16 is the @xmath46 page in the hypercohomology spectral sequence associated to the weight filtration of @xmath47 .",
    "we can also close a positive braid in the plane , by joining the ends in a `` rainbow '' pattern ( nonintersecting and above the braid itself ) . in this case",
    "we find the moduli spaces carry a natural stratification by graded rulings .",
    "[ thm : augthm ] let @xmath9 be the rainbow closure of a positive braid with @xmath48 crossings , carrying a maslov potential taking the value zero on all strands of the braid .",

    "ruling filtrations are interesting in their own right , and can for instance be used to construct an extension of the microlocal monodromy to a local system on an abstract ( not equipped with a map to @xmath57 ) surface bounding the knot .",
    "we leave open the very natural question of how , in general , the ` normality ' condition on rulings interacts with ruling filtrations . resolving",
    "this question for a rainbow closure of a positive braid is a crucial step in the above result .",
    "the category @xmath21 was created as a constructible - sheaf analogue of the fukaya category near infinity . as such it bears a kinship with legendrian contact homology , which in the dimension at hand is the chekanov - eliashberg differential graded algebra ( `` c - e dga '' ) of a legendrian knot , or its linearization through augmentations .",
    "we conjecture that this heuristic relationship leads to an equivalence of categories .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath58 be the bilinearized legendrian contact homology @xmath59-category of @xcite , i.e. the category of augmentations of the c - e dga .",

    "theorem [ thm : augthm ] asserts that , at least for rainbow braid closures , @xmath61 has the same sort of structural decomposition as the `` augmentation variety '' of henry - rutherford @xcite .",

    "finally , our category separates the chekanov pair :    if @xmath65 are the two chekanov knots , then @xmath66    we close the introduction with a discussion of a subject to which we will not return in the body of the paper .",
    "theorem [ thm : augthm ] and a theorem of rutherford @xcite lead to _ a different _ relation between our category and the homfly polynomial .",

    "but , again because the space is noncompact , the weight series differs from the poincar series .",
    "it follows from the above result and the @xmath74 symmetry of the homfly polynomial that , curiously , the weight series is symmetric .",
    "the same phenomenon was observed by hausel and rodrigues - villegas in character varieties of surfaces @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the weight polynomials is the beginning of a series of conjectures about the cohomology of the character varieties of surfaces , the strongest of which is currently the `` p = w '' conjecture @xcite .",
    "this asserts that the weight filtration ( after re - indexing ) on the cohomology of the ( twisted ) character variety of a surface can be identified with the perverse leray filtration associated to the moduli space of higgs bundles on a riemann surface with the same underlying topological surface .",
    "the ( unfiltered ) cohomologies of these spaces are identified by the nonabelian hodge theorem , which gives a diffeomorphism between the character variety and the moduli of higgs bundles @xcite .    in the case of the link of a plane curve singularity",
    ", there is a natural candidate for a `` p = w '' conjecture for @xmath75 , suggested by the relation between homfly polynomial of such a curve singularity to moduli of sheaves on the curve @xcite .",
    "specifically , taking @xmath76 to be a locally planar rational curve with a unique singularity , @xmath77 be its compactified jacobian , and @xmath67 the link of the singularity , we know @xmath78 above , @xmath79 is the milnor number and @xmath80 the number of branches of the singularity , i.e. , the number of components of the knot .",
    "the link of a plane curve singularity always admits a positive braid presentation , and if this has @xmath0 strands and @xmath48 crossings , we have @xmath81 .",
    "finally , @xmath82 is the associated graded with respect to the perverse leray filtration induced on @xmath83 by any family of relative compactified jacobians with smooth total space , for instance , as might be found in the hitchin system .",
    "thus we conclude :    [ cor : eulpequalsw ] let @xmath76 be a rational plane curve with a unique singularity ; let @xmath9 be a rainbow closure of a positive braid such that the topological knot underlying @xmath9 is the link of the singularity . then @xmath84    the proof of corollary [ cor : eulpequalsw ] involves a great deal of nontrivial calculations on both sides .",
    "however we expect that it will ultimately receive a conceptual explanation , which we state as the following informal conjecture :    [ conj : pequalsw ] let @xmath76 be a locally planar rational curve with a unique singularity ; let @xmath9 be a rainbow closure of a positive braid such that the topological knot underlying @xmath9 is the link of the singularity .",
    "then @xmath61 ` is ' the wild character variety which is the counterpart under the nonabelian hodge theorem of a wild hitchin system whose central fibre is the compactified jacobian of @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , @xmath85 holds in this setting .",

    "these are physics papers , and the mathematical foundations for the wild character variety in this sense are not yet in the literature .",

    "if a plane isotopy does not preserve the relative positions of the @xmath87-coordinates of the cusps and crossings , it will not necessarily carry a normal ruling to a normal ruling .",

    "we expect the same can be said for an arbitrary legendrian knot .",
