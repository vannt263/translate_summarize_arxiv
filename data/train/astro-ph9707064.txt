    "early - type galaxies have been studied in great detail in rich clusters up to redshift one and above ( see dickinson , 1997 ) , with the basic result that passive evolution in luminosity and no evolution in mass is ruling them at least up to @xmath6 .",
    "old ages and an early epoch of formation are then implied by these observations .",
    "it is however still unclear how much representative of the general population is the rich - cluster environment : according to a common wisdom , early - type galaxies in the field might be much younger and follow a quite different evolutionary pattern ( baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; kaufmann et al . 1996 ) .    an exceedingly deep and clean view of field galaxy populations to high redshifts is provided by a long integration of hst in the so - called _ hubble deep field _",
    "( hdf , williams et al . , 1996 ) . though having provided important constraints on galaxy formation and evolution ( madau et al .",
    "1997 ) , the interpretation of these data is made difficult by the relatively short selection wavelengths ( essentially u , b , v , i ) , which imply strong evolutionary and k - corrections as a function of redshift and by the sensitivity to even small amounts of dust in the line - of - sight .",
    "the former two may be particularly severe for the early - type galaxies , because of their quickly evolving optical spectra and extreme k - corrections ( e.g. maoz , 1997 )",
    ".    major arguments for performing time - expensive surveys in the near - infrared , in particular in the k band , were to overcome most of these problems of optical selection .",
    "a further one is that at these wavelengths the fluxes from all ( low - mass ) stars dominating the baryonic content of a galaxy are counted .",
    "various deep integrations have been performed in the hdf at near - ir ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; dickinson , 1997 ) and mid - ir wavelengths ( rowan - robinson et al . 1997 ; aussel et al .",
    "1997 ) , which , combined with the extreme quality of the morphological information and the very good spectroscopic coverage , make this area unique , in particular for the investigation of early - type galaxies outside rich clusters .",
    "this letter is a preliminary report of an analysis of a bright complete k - band selected sub - sample of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the hdf .",
    "section 2 discusses physical properties of the galaxies as inferred from the morphology and from fits to the broad - band uv - optical - ir spectra .",
    "section 3 investigates the statistical properties of the sample ( counts , redshift distributions , identification statistics ) , and compare them with those of local early - type galaxies .",
    "the distribution in space - time of the sample is found to display a discontinuity at @xmath7 , which apparently conflicts with the relaxed and passively behaving nature of the galaxies .",
    "solutions of this paradox are discussed in sections 4 and 5 , by comparing the effects of merging with those of a long lasting dust - extinguished phase .",
    "we adopt @xmath8 throughout the paper .",
    "our reference sample includes galaxies classified as ellipticals and s0 in the hawaii active catalogue of the hdf by cowie et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , having k - band magnitudes brighter than 20 over the 4 square arcmin area covered by the 3 hst - wf cameras , observed in the j and h+k by cowie et al . , and morphologically classified by van den berg et al .",
    "we have re - defined the hk - selected sample reported by songaila et al . into a k - selected one by using the irim - kpno image ( dickinson , 1997 ) .",
    "magnitudes are measured in 5 arcsec diameter apertures .",
    "the complete sample consists of 19 early - type galaxies with @xmath9 , for 11 of which cohen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report spectroscopic redshifts , while for the remaining 8 a reliable estimate of @xmath3 is obtained from fits of the optical - ir broad - band spectra .",
    "we have verified that the typical error to be associated to the latter is not larger than 0.1 .",
    "morphologically , these galaxies appear as quite regular early - type systems up to the redshift limit of the sample , in no way dissimilar from local counterparts .",
    "the complete e / s0 sample to @xmath10 is supplemented by a fainter one including 9 early - types and 7 unclassified objects down to @xmath11 . however , this enlarged sample has far less complete morphological and spectroscopic information , and is then used only to test the models for consistency at fainter magnitudes and somewhat larger redshifts",
    ".      the uv - optical - near / ir spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for all galaxies in the sample have been fitted with synthetic spectra based on a model briefly summarized here .",
    "the code follows two paths , one describing the chemical evolution of the galaxy s ism , the other associating to any galactic time a generation of stars with the appropriate metallicity , and adding up the contributions light of all previous stellar populations .",
    "the chemical path adopts a salpeter imf with a lower limit @xmath12 , and a schmidt - type law for the star formation rate ( sfr ) : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the sf efficiency .",
    "a further parameter is the time - scale @xmath15 for the infall of the primordial gas .",
    "the library of isochrones is based on the padova models , spanning a range in metallicities from @xmath16 to 0.05 ( i.e. from 0.3 to 2.5 solar ) .",
    "the isochrones are modified to account for the contribution by dust - embedded mira and oh stars during the agb phase ( bressan et al .",
    "1997 ) , when circum - stellar dust reddens the optical emission and produces an ir bump at 5 - 20 @xmath17 . this ir emission from agb stars is important for galactic ages of 0.1 to a few gyrs .",
    "a number of evolutionary patterns for the time - dependent sfr @xmath18 have been tried to reproduce the galaxy seds ( four examples of which appear in figure 1 ) . though solutions are not univocally determined , a few general trends are clearly written in the data .",
    "the first is that the bulk of the baryonic mass in objects observed at the typical redshift @xmath2 has to be older than at least three gyr , under the assumption of an high average stellar metallicity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "lower metallicities would imply bluer spectra , hence even older ages .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the second evidence is that , overimposed on this old stellar component dominating the spectra from 0.6 to 2.2 @xmath17 and including typically more than 90% of the mass , a younger population is always present , as suggested by the often blue u and b colours .",
    "the evolution pattern ( model 1 hereafter ) fitting the seds predicts that a large fraction of the mass in stars has been generated during an intense burst lasting 0.7 gyr , after which the input of energy by stellar winds and supernovae produced a sudden outflow of the ism through a galactic wind , stopping the bulk of the sf . the evolution at later epochs is mostly due to passive aging of already formed stellar populations .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "1 , fitting the red side of spectra , are the contribution of such an old population ( though not exactly corresponding to model 1 , but to a similar one described in sect . 4 below ) .",
    "the global fit requires the additional contribution of a minor fraction of the mass in younger stars ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we have shown that a dominant fraction of the galactic baryonic mass has to be at least as old as 3 gyr for objects observed at @xmath20 .",
    "correspondingly , the luminosity of these stellar populations is bound to increase with redshift during most of the cosmic time preceeding the epoch when galaxies are observed ( the precise amount of such an increase depends weakly on the detailed values of the model parameters ) .",
    "it is of interest to check if this expected trend for the luminosity evolution can be reconciled with the statistical properties of this and other k - selected galaxy samples . to this end ,",
    "model 1 has been combined with the the k - band luminosity function ( llf ) of galaxies to predict sample statistics , under the assumption of a roughly constant galaxy mass function from redshift 0 to 3 .",
    "our adopted llf is taken from gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which significantly updates previous determinations .",
    "the separate contributions of early- ( e / s0 ) and late - type ( sp / ir ) galaxies have been defined using the morphological information on the optical llf by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and type - dependent b - k colours .",
    "we agree with gardner et al . that the shape of the llf can be naturally reconciled with faint k - band counts only in an open universe , while a closure one would require some `` ad hoc '' evolutionary prescriptions . then model 1 for e / s0 galaxies ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , supplemented with a moderate evolution for sp / ir galaxies as in mazzei et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , provides a good fit to the counts for @xmath21 .",
    "a crucial information is provided by the observed @xmath3-distribution d(z ) of early - type galaxies in the k - hdf ( figure 2 ) . from @xmath22 to @xmath6 , d(z ) is consistent with a moderate ( essentially passive ) evolution in an open universe ( with @xmath23=0.1 - 0.2 ) .",
    "again , a closure world model would require positive evolution , i.e. a larger comoving luminosity / density of massive e / s0s at @xmath3=1 than locally .",
    "hence , there is no evidence , up to this epoch , of an evolution of the baryon mass function .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with a decrease of the mass and luminosity due to progressive disappearence of big galaxies in favour of smaller mass units , as implied by some specifications of the hierarchical clustering scheme ( e.g. baugh , cole , & frenk , 1996 ) .",
    "this also seem at odd with the finding by kauffmann , charlot & white ( 1996 ) of a strong negative evolution of the early - type population ( by a factor 2 - 3 less in number density at @xmath3=1 ) .    above z=1.2",
    ", however , model 1 has difficulties to reproduce the redshift distribution reported in fig . 2 and the identification statistics in figure 3 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the observational d(z ) is the sharp cutoff at @xmath5 , such that no galaxies of the complete sample occur at such @xmath3 .",
    "model 1 is in no way able to explain the large number of sources at @xmath24 followed by the rapid convergence above : the prediction would be of a much more gentle distribution , with less a pronounced peak and a large tail of galaxies ( incuding typically half of sample objects ) observable above @xmath6 .",
    "lower values of @xmath23 would allow better fits of the observed d(z ) up to @xmath25 , but would also worsen the mis - fit at higher @xmath3 .",
    "a similar effect is observed in the counts as a function of the morphological class ( fig .",
    "again sources identified as e / s0s show steep counts to k=19 and a sudden convergence thereafter , while the model would predict much less rapid change in the slope .",
    "these problems remain forcing in various ways the model parameters .",
    "at redshifts larger than 1.3 , early - type galaxies suddenly disappear from the k - selected sample , while we would expect to observe them to much higher @xmath3 , given the predicted luminosity enhancement when approaching the most intense phase of star formation .",
    "the latter is expected to happen at @xmath3=2 to 5 after our analysis of the stellar populations in @xmath3=1 objects .    in principle , this lack of high - z objects might be taken as an indication in favour of a fast _ merging_-driven evolution of the mass function of galaxies at these redshifts . to be effective , however , this process has to operate on short timescales ( @xmath26 gyr ) and , in particular , to assemble already formed , old and metal rich stellar populations , as implied by the spectra of @xmath27 galaxies ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . only a small fraction ( less than a few percent ) of the mass in young stars has to be added to the galaxy , so stellar systems essentially deprived of gas are to be accreted , otherwise the gas would make stars actively during this dynamically perturbed phase . as suggested by n - body simulations , typical outcomes of strong galaxy collisions are rings and bars , which are very rarely observed in hdf galaxies ( van den berg et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "finally , it seems unlikely that the _ merge _ producing ellipticals and s0s should operate only among gas - poor systems , if we consider that gas - rich objects are so numerous in the field .",
    "an alternative interpretation , discussed here , for the lack of objects at @xmath5 in the k - hdf assumes that dust , present in a highly metal - enriched ism during the first 3 to 4 gyr of the evolution of massive galaxies , extinguishes the light emitted by high redshift objects .",
    "the idea is that the sf efficiency in field galaxies with deep dark - matter potential wells is not so high to produce a galactic wind on short timescales after the onset of sf .",
    "hence an ism is present in the galaxy for an appreciable fraction of the hubble time , during which the ism is progressively enriched of metals and dust . while the gas fraction diminishes as stars are continuously formed at low rates , its metallicity increases and",
    "keeps the dust optical depht roughly constant with time .    we have then extended the model of sect .",
    "2.2 to account for the effect of extinction and re - radiation by dust in star - forming molecular regions and more diffused in the galaxy body ( see for details granato et al .",
    "the amount of dust in the galaxy is assumed proportional to the residual gas fraction and chemical abundance of c and si , while the relative amount of molecular to diffuse gas ( @xmath28 ) is a model parameter .",
    "the molecular gas is divided into spherical clouds of assigned mass ( @xmath29 ) and radius ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "each generation of stars born within the cloud progressively escapes it on timescales of a few myr with a velocity @xmath31 .",
    "the emerging spectrum is obtained by solving the radiative transfer through the cloud . before escaping the galaxy , the light arising from young stars / molecular complexes , as well as from older stellar generations , further interacts with dust present in the diffuse gas component ( the latter dominates the global galactic extinction at late epochs , when the sf rate is low ) .",
    "the dimming of starlight and consequent dust emission are computed by describing the galaxy as a spherically symmetric system subdivided into volume elements , with radial dependences of stars and gas described by a king profile with a core radius @xmath32 .",
    "this evolutionary code was used to explore alternatives to model 1 .",
    "we found a solution ( hereafter model 2 ) with the following parameter values : baryonic mass @xmath33 , ( typical for our sample galaxies ) , @xmath34 gyr , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , the sfr @xmath18 has a peak value of @xmath39 at galactic time @xmath40 gyr and then decays as a power - law @xmath41 . after 4.5 gyr , the balance of gas thermal energy vs. input from supernavae breaks , and formally most of the small residual gas is then lost by the galaxy . after this event",
    "a low - level sf activity keeps on , due to either partial efficiency of the wind , or to stellar re - cycling .",
    "the average stellar metallicity of the remnant is @xmath42 .",
    "this scheme naturally accounts for the evidence ( fig .",
    "1 ) that the highest redshift galaxies in the k - hdf show a combination of a massive amount of old ( @xmath43 gyr ) stellar populations plus a small fraction of younger stars .",
    "fits of galaxy seds from model 2 ( as reported in fig .",
    "1 ) can be found assuming an open world model with @xmath44 .",
    "the redshifts @xmath45 for the onset of sf span a fairly wide range from 2 to 5 ( field early - types are not coeval in this sense , and in particular low - mass systems are younger on average ) , with an average value @xmath46 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    by constraction , the same scheme is successful in reproducing statistical distributions in figs . 2 and 3 , in addition to other galaxy counts in the k - band .",
    "now both the drastic cutoffs of d(z ) for e / s0s at z=1.3 and of the counts at @xmath47 are reproduced .",
    "figure 4 summarizes our understanding of the e / s0 sample galaxies , as for the baryonic mass ( top ) , the residual sf rate @xmath48 ( mid ) , and the timescale needed by this sf activity to build the observed mass in stars ( bottom ) .",
    "the residual sf rate is typically @xmath49 , and can not contribute more than a few % of the baryonic mass for most of the galaxies .",
    "note , finally , that the results in fig .",
    "4 are very robust : essentially the same would be found using model 1 instead of 2 .",
    "near - ir observations provide a view of galaxy evolution minimally biased by the effects of the evolutionary k - correction , dust extinction and changes in the @xmath50 ratio due to the aging of stellar populations .",
    "we have used a near - ir sample in the hdf with optimal morphological information and spectro - photometric coverage to study properties of distant early - type galaxies outside rich clusters .",
    "the seds of early - types in the hdf can be explained in terms of a dominant old stellar population ( older than 3 - 5 gyr already at z=1 ) with a mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the residual sf indicated by the blue u - b colours can only contribute some percent of the mass in stars .",
    "so , the main sf event producing the bulk of stars is confined to happen at @xmath51 for reasonable world models .",
    "these general properties are not inconsistent with those found for cluster ellipticals studied at medium to high redshifts .",
    "early - types in the field are not coeval , however , the formation redshifts spanning a fairly wide range , @xmath52 to 5 , and the low - mass systems being younger on average .",
    "a basic problem is found when comparing the fraction of high - z objects expected on the basis of a simple photometric model with the observed distribution : a sizeable number would be expected at @xmath53 , while none is observed .",
    "though not all redshifts in the sample are spectroscopically confirmed , the latter conclusion seems quite robust : if optical spectroscopy has difficulties to enter this redshift domain , our analysis , using broad - band galaxy seds when spectroscopic redshifts are not available , has no obvious biases , while the uncertainty in the photometric estimate of @xmath3 for this kind of spectra is small .",
    "of course , caution is in order about our conclusions because of the limited statistics .",
    "improvements will be achieved by further areas deeply investigated by hsf ( e.g. the southern hdf ) and by further efforts of optical and near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "to explain the large number of e / s0s at z=1 and their quick disappearence above , _ merging _ would have to operate on quite short timescales ( @xmath26 gyr ) and to assemble mostly stellar systems , to avoid triggering an excess amount of star formation .",
    "this is perhaps an uneasy situation as for the dynamics and for the probability of the event , that would be expected to favour , if any , dynamically efficient encounters between the numerous gas - rich systems .",
    "we have discussed an alternative solution in terms of a somewhat protracted presence of a dusty and opaque ism during the first 3 - 4 gyr of galaxy s life , after which thermal unbalance in the ism - due to a low residual gas mass and energy input by type - i sn - would clean up the object and make it transparent . a somewhat protracted sf activity in field ,",
    "as opposed to cluster , ellipticals may be consistent with their observed `` disky '' morphology and the @xmath54 narrow - band indices .",
    "the implication of this is that long wavelength observations would be better suited to detect and characterize the early evolutionary phases of spheroidal galaxies .",
    "figure 5 illustrates possible spectra corresponding to different ages of a @xmath55 galaxy at @xmath56 , according to model 2 . as indicated by the figure , various planned missions ( in launch - time order , sirtf",
    ", esa s first , nasa s ngst , and some ground - based observatories in exceptionally dry sites , like the south pole ) could discover unexpectedly intense activity of star - formation at @xmath57 to 5 .",
    "also interesting tests of these ideas could be soon achieved with scuba on jcmt , and with iso ."
