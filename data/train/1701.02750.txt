    "since @xcite suggested that a galaxy might lose its interstellar medium ( ism ) by interacting with the intracluster medium ( icm ) in the cluster environment , much evidence for ram pressure stripping has been found to date . in early days , @xcite have shown that virgo galaxies are generally more deficient in hi compared to field galaxies based on their single - dish observations .",
    "in addition , @xcite have found that the hi content is well correlated with the location of galaxies in a sense that hi is more deficient at smaller distances from the cluster centre .",
    "then the hi synthesis imaging studies such as @xcite and @xcite have shown that hi - deficient galaxies near the cluster centre have small hi - to - optical extents , truncated within the stellar disc in many cases . in a more recent high - resolution hi imaging study of @xmath150 selected virgo galaxies by @xcite , a number of galaxies have been found with various scales of extraplanar hi gas or long hi tails , indicating that ram pressure stripping is indeed acting in the cluster environment .    as a galaxy loses its ism ,",
    "the star formation rate is expected to be suppressed , which agrees well with the observations . as a good example , @xcite find that the massive star formation rate of virgo spirals is lower than their field counterpart by a factor of 2.5 on average .",
    "@xcite also show that many virgo spirals have a smaller h@xmath0 extent compared to their stellar disc , reflecting that the process truncating hi discs may also be acting on the star - forming disc and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "on the other hand , molecular gas is unlikely to be as easily stripped as atomic hydrogen , since it is more tightly bound to the galactic centre and the density is higher .",
    "in fact , most previous studies find that the molecular gas mass of the cluster population is not significantly different from that of field galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , more recent studies are finding clumpy dust features in the upstream side of hi gas stripped galaxies , which are likely to be surviving dense clouds that are unveiled after diffuse atomic gas is removed ( @xcite ; kenney , abramson & bravo - alfaro 2015 ) .",
    "on the other hand , however , the opposite results also have been reported .",
    "@xcite find that h@xmath2 mass normalized by the dynamical mass of galaxies tends to get larger with increasing clustercentric distance , which supports that molecular gas can be also deficient in the cluster environment .",
    "more recently , @xcite show that hi - deficient galaxies in the cluster environment tend to be also modestly deficient in molecular gas",
    ".    however , the molecular gas fraction to the optical luminosity of spiral galaxies measured using 12co ( 1@xmath30 ) ranges quite widely for all environments @xcite .",
    "this implies that the molecular gas fraction alone may not be a good tracer of molecular gas deficiency . due to the scatter in this relation and opposing observational results",
    ", it is still arguable whether molecular gas can be affected by the icm pressure in a similar way to hi gas , and it is then still puzzling why star formation appears to be quenched in hi stripped galaxies if molecular gas , which is the more direct ingredient for star formation , is not deficient .     of the sample in the _ b _ band .",
    "ngc  4569 that we have not observed using the sma but is included in our discussion as a good representative of a galaxy at post - peak pressure , is shown in green .",
    "the sample galaxies , located at 0.41 mpc from m87 , adopting a virgo distance of 16 mpc @xcite , make a nice sequence of ram pressure stripping from early stage , close to peak pressure and post - peak pressure in their orbit . ]",
    "no clear evidence for molecular gas stripping yet low star formation activities in cluster galaxies may imply distinct molecular gas properties in high - density environments as supported by some previous observations .",
    "for example , @xcite have found a highly asymmetric co morphology in an hi deficient virgo cluster galaxy .",
    "@xcite also have found very peculiar co distributions in some of virgo spirals undergoing active hi stripping .",
    "these studies indicate that molecular gas can be potentially disturbed by strong icm pressure whether it is stripped or not .    particularly along the side experiencing icm pressure , it has been suggested that interstellar gas including the molecular phase can be pushed up against the centre of a galaxy .",
    "this leads to ism compression and increasing h@xmath2 formation ; hence , it locally triggers intensive star formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , ism compression with high molecular fraction in the upstream side is seen in a number of galaxies experiencing icm pressure ( @xcite ; nehlig , vollmer & braine 2016 ) , which are often accompanied by an enhancement of star formation .",
    "molecular gas enhancement among the virgo cluster members has been also recently reported by @xcite .",
    "these observations clearly show that molecular gas properties and hence star formation activity within a stellar disc can be affected by ram pressure .    therefore , in order to get a deeper understanding on how galaxies become passive after hi stripping , not only the possibility of stripping but also the detailed properties of molecular gas inside a galaxy under strong icm pressure need to be probed .",
    "hence , using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , we have taken high - resolution 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) imaging data of a subsample of virgo galaxies that have lost atomic gas significantly by icm pressure .",
    "some preliminary results are published in @xcite , and in this work , we present more complete analysis on both morphology and kinematics of three virgo galaxies based on the sma data .    this paper is organized as follows .",

    "this co clump corresponds to 2 per cent of the total in flux ( @xmath11.9@xmath2710@xmath28  @xmath6 , comparable to that of a large molecular cloud ) .",

    "the kinematical complexity is also clearly seen in the pvd ( fig .",
    "[ n4330]c ) . a distinct component of a steep velocity gradient in the central @xmath113 arcsec ( @xmath11 kpc ) is quite noticeable .",
    "this may indicate a molecular ring or bar .",
    "in addition , the co peak is off from the stellar disc centre by @xmath1270 pc ( fig .",

    "[ n4402](a ) , the co disc of ngc  4402 is slightly more extended in the west ( 62 arcsec in the west versus 58 arcsec in the east ) , but the difference is subtle and not as significant as in hi .",

    "a modest co bump ( indicated by arrow in fig .",
    "[ n4402]a ) is found as in hi ( fig .",

    "the northern part above the major axis is measured to be 91 per cent of that of the south in flux .",
    "although the co peak agrees well with the stellar disc centre , the inner co disc also appears to be slightly more stretched toward the west , reflecting the outer co disc .",
    "the co kinematics reveals the evidence for non - circular motions as shown in fig .",
    "[ n4402](b ) . in the inner region ,",
    "the iso - velocity curves are highly skewed and not perfectly parallel with the minor axis .",

    "the velocity gradient in the outer part is quite different in the two sides of the disc along the major axis .",

    "it also has a distinct co component with steep velocity gradient in the inner @xmath115 arcsec .",
    "this likely indicates a nuclear bar or ring , although we favor a nuclear bar as this would also explain the skewed isovelocity contours . in ngc  4402",
    ", @xcite also find a nuclear molecular disc traced by 12co ( 1@xmath30 ) in the inner @xmath110 arcsec .",
    "we do not find any direct relevance of these nuclear structures with ram pressure stripping .      while the overall size of 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) disc in the sma image is consistent with the extent measured by a single dish for ngc  4330 @xcite and ngc  4402 ( lee et al . in preparation ) , our sma data of ngc  4522 reveal only the inner @xmath157 per cent of its single - dish map in size @xcite .",
    "while @xcite have detected co along the extraplanar h@xmath0 and hi in both ends of the disc , we did not detect any such features in the south - west in our sma data due to the lack of sensitivity and/or potentially due to the diffuse nature of gas in the outer molecular disc .",

    "the co extent is comparable in both sides ( 27.4 arcsec in the north - east versus 27.6 arcsec in the south - west ) .",
    "the inner co disc of ngc  4522 is found to be curved in the opposite way to the outer co and hi disc , i.e. to the south - east as the inner h@xmath0 disc .",
    "we find two features sticking out from the inner part , one from the end of north - east disc and another almost to the same direction but connected from the centre of the main disc , more to the south .",
    "the north - east blob coincides with the morphology of the inner co disc in the iram image ( fig .",
    "[ multi]c ; @xcite ) , which is smoothly connected to the disc farther extended in the north - east , coinciding with a dust loop in this region . while the downward bending coincides with the inner spiral structure including the dust feature ( see fig .  [ hst ] in appendix a ) .",
    "the co velocity structure within the main disc generally shows that of a regularly rotating disc as seen in figs  [ n4522](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the velocity keeps rising up to @xmath110 arcsec on both sides , then almost flattens out , and toward the end of the disc , the velocity rises again .",
    "the velocity gradient along the north - east branch is overall consistent with that of the main disc on the same side .",
    "however , the gradient is smaller and the velocity rises more slowly compared to the other side .",
    "in this section , we compare 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) properties with other wavelength data including hi @xcite , optical ( dss2 red ) , fuv @xcite , and h@xmath0 ( ngc  4330 and ngc  4569 from @xcite , ngc  4402 from @xcite , ngc  4522 from koopmann , kenney , & young 2001 ) .",

    "considering the high inclination of all three galaxies in our sample , we utilize the strip integral method instead of ellipse fitting to derive radial surface density because ellipse fitting is usually inappropriate for edge - on galaxies when the spatial resolution is limited @xcite .",
    "this method calculates _ strip integrals _ by integrating hi column density perpendicularly to the major axis , using lucy s ( 1974 ) iterative deconvolution method .",
    "then the strip integrals of approaching and receding sides are deprojected separately to infer the face - on hi surface density @xcite .",
    "the surface density of both atomic and molecular hydrogen is measured in @xmath6  pc@xmath7 .",
    "the comparison between atomic and molecular gas radial distributions is found in the bottom on the left - hand column of figs  [ n4330][n4522 ] .",
    "overlays between co and other multiwavelength data are presented on the right - hand column of figs  [ n4330][n4522 ] and fig .",

    "are also overlaid in the composite map .",
    "the sensitivity of the iram cubes is @xmath110 mk per 5 km  s@xmath8 channel ( the same channel width as ours ) , which is comparable to the sma cubes or slightly better in the cases of ngc  4330 and ngc  4522 when the different spatial resolutions are taken into account ( @xmath111 arcsec versus @xmath15 arcsec for iram and sma , respectively ) . for ngc  4402 , the sensitivity of sma data is somewhat better than the iram data not only because of the sufficient integration time with the sma but also because of the poor weather condition when the iram data were taken . for ngc  4330 and ngc  4402 ,",
    "the iram and sma maps are generally in good agreement in morphology , considering the beam sizes , while we are missing most of the extraplanar molecular of ngc  4522 in the sma data due to the lack in coverage , sensitivity , and/or potentially due to the diffuse nature of molecular gas in the extragalactic space as further discussed in section 5.1.3 .",
    "asymmetry is ubiquitous in a range of wavelengths data except in the red optical image ( dss2 red ) . in fig .",

    "the single - dish 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) data @xcite appear to be similar to the radio morphology , also with some hint of upturn , although the extent of the molecular gas is much less than that of hi . in our sma data , we are missing some outermost features including the tip of the nose in the north - east . instead",
    ", the sma data clearly reveal very detailed structures of the inner co disc such as the difference in scaleheight between the north and the south along the major axis ( up to @xmath10.36 kpc , fig .",
    "[ n4330]a ) which is not as clear as this in the previous single - dish data .    the south - west side , i.e. the downstream of the galaxy where an hi gas tail is present , is bent toward the south .",
    "on this side , we also find fuv , h@xmath0 and radio continuum tail but the extents and bending angles are all different in various wavelengths ( fig  [ multi]a ) .",
    "the distribution becomes patchy in the outer co disc as seen in both iram single - dish data @xcite as well as our sma data .",
    "intriguingly , the co blob toward the end is located in almost the same galactic radius as one of the distinct h@xmath0 blobs and off from the mid - plane in the same direction as the tails of the other wavelengths ( fig  [ multi]a ) .",
    "as clearly seen , the molecular disc , which extends to only half the stellar disc or less , shows many properties in common with the morphologies in the other wavelengths , reflecting the impact of the icm pressure .",
    "although there are subtle differences , this suggests that the molecular gas in this galaxy has been also affected in similar ways by the same mechanism that is responsible for the peculiarities found in the other wavelengths .",
    "this indicates that icm pressure can change molecular gas properties well inside the stellar disc .",
    "the co emission shows a number of properties in common with the hi gas ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]d ) .",
    "it is somewhat extended in the west , i.e. the same side where the hi is more extended .",
    "both phases show a bump in the west ( indicated by arrow in fig .",
    "[ n4402]a ) , although the scale is distinct because the hi bump is visible in extraplanar gas .",
    "hi is truncated within the mid - plane of the stellar disc on both sides , with a sharp cut - off in the east to south along the upstream . meanwhile ,",
    "the northern side is more extended with a short tail pointing the north - west in the downstream side .",
    "the extent of the molecular gas is not significantly different in the receding and the approaching side , yet its distribution is quite distinct",
    ". these differences between the two sides of the co disc can be also clearly seen in the radial velocity distributions ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]c ) .",
    "note that the hi extent appears to be almost twice as long as the co in the west due to the tail ( figs  [ n4402]c and d ) .",
    "the molecular gas disc is thicker in the east ( especially third contour level from the outermost contour ) , reflecting the change in fuv disc thickness across the disc .",
    "although the overall morphology of fuv is quite different from that of co , both the fuv enhancement and co compression are present in the east and south - east ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]e ) .",
    "h@xmath0 is tightly correlated with co in general , with a similar distribution and extent .",
    "also , strong h@xmath0 knots are found near or within the local co peaks ( fig  [ n4402]f ) . as with ngc  4330",
    ", the co morphology is surprisingly similar to that of hi , strongly suggesting that the impact of the icm has reached the inner interstellar gas disc .",
    "with given sensitivity limit , we are missing the outer part of the molecular gas disc in the sma data for this case .",
    "as shown by @xcite , however , the overall morphology of co is quite similar to that of hi , revealing a significant fraction of molecular gas outside the stellar disc ( fig  [ multi]c )",
    ". this galaxy must be one of the best examples found to date where extraplanar molecular gas is present .",
    "in addition to the sensitivity , the molecular gas could be more diffuse in nature compared to the gas within the disc , which could make the detection more difficult .",
    "in fact , we recently have detected some extragalactic 13co ( 1@xmath30 ) in ngc  4522 using the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) - cycle 3 .",
    "the nature of this extraplanar co gas will be further analyzed using 12/13co ratio , and will be presented in a separate work .",
    "the inner co disc is slightly bent down to the south as h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the strongest h@xmath0 blobs near the galactic centre are located within the inner co disc ( fig  [ n4522]f ) , but there is an offset between the inner fuv enhancement and the inner co disc ( fig  [ n4522]e ) .",
    "however , this offset in the inner region might be simply due to the dust extinction effect .",
    "on the other hand , the offset between co ( the iram data)/h@xmath0 and fuv at large radii is real since there is almost no dust beyond the co extent .",
    "the extent of fuv is larger than the co and h@xmath0 extents within the stellar disc by a factor of 1.5 ( fig .",
    "[ multi]c ) . however , the fuv enhancement is roughly consistent with the co compression in the downstream side as in ngc  4402 .",
    "this implies that there is significant change in the recent star formation activity and the distribution of molecular gas in a very short time as further discussed in section  [ sec5].3 .",
    "most previous studies using single - dish radio telescopes did not find a significant difference in co luminosities between field galaxies and cluster members @xcite .",
    "however , some individual galaxies in the cluster environment have been reported to show very distinct co distributions from those with normal hi content in the field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that the molecular gas surface density of galaxies that are hi - deficient tends to be low .",
    "these suggest that the molecular gas of cluster galaxies can be affected in some ways by ram pressure even if it is not stripped .",
    "indeed , our high - resolution co data clearly show that molecular gas has been affected in a similar manner as diffuse gas by ram pressure , and the impact of icm winds reaches as deeply as a few kpc from the galactic centre , as we further elaborate below .",
    "firstly , the co morphology in our sample is all found to be highly asymmetric and disturbed .",
    "the inner molecular gas disc of many field galaxies does show some peculiarities to a certain degree , including asymmetry ( e.g. bima song survey ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the overall asymmetry found in the co morphology of all three galaxies is similar to that of the hi morphology . in figs  [ multi](a)(c )",
    ", the composite maps of cool ism contents ( co and hi ) , star formation indicators ( fuv and h@xmath0 ) and the old stellar disc ( dss2 red ) of our sma sample are presented . a rough direction of the icm wind based on the hi morphology for each case",
    "is shown with thick arrows .",
    "secondly , the detailed co structure of the sample shows good connections with the hi features which have been pushed and/or stripped by the icm pressure .",
    "in ngc  4330 , the co clump in the south - west end seems to have been pushed down to the south from the mid - plane of the stellar disc , similarly to its hi tail ( fig .",
    "[ n4330]d ) .",
    "in addition , similar kinematical structures are found in this side , i.e. in the downstream in both hi and co ( fig .  [ pvd ] ) .",
    "for example , the co gas reveals an inverted velocity gradient in the end of south - west like hi which shows an anomalous velocity component in the same side @xcite .",
    "this implies that dense molecular phase gas can be pushed by ram pressure in addition to the diffuse atomic phase gas .",
    "although the morphology is suggestive of gas being pushed away , one problem with this possibility is that both the hi tail and the co clump in the downstream are found with higher velocities than the main disc , i.e. the opposite direction of the system velocity of cluster centre .",
    "this is inconsistent with what is generally expected in the case of the gas pushed by the icm as found in other virgo spirals ( e.g. ngc  4522 ; kenney , van gorkom & vollmer 2004 ) .",
    "however , this is still feasible if the gas has been losing angular momentum in extraplanar space as suggested by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the co clump might be an example of a dense cloud unveiled after the stripping of surrounding diffuse gas , which hence appears to stand alone , decoupled from the rest of the disc , similar to the ones seen as narrow dusty plumes found in virgo galaxies such as ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 @xcite or ngc  4921 , a coma spiral @xcite .",
    "if this is an example of those decoupled clouds , it is the first time it has been seen clearly in co. however , one aspect that makes this case particularly interesting is its gas kinematics . rather than being smoothly connected from the inner disc ,",
    "the velocity gradient at the location of the co clump turns back .",
    "this velocity structure strongly suggests that this clump is the molecular gas that has been pushed off from the main disc .    in ngc  4402 , both hi and co are compressed from the south - east to south along the upstream .",
    "meanwhile in the north - west , a modest co bump is found to be pointing to the same direction as the hi bump ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]d ) .",
    "the compressed co in the upstream side reveals a steeper velocity gradient than the other side .",
    "meanwhile , the co bump in the north - west downstream side ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]b ) is found to have larger velocities than the main disc ( fig .",
    "[ n4402]c ) , i.e. closer to the cluster centre .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations if the gas is accelerated by ram pressure due to the icm .    in ngc  4522 , the overall co morphology from the iram data",
    "@xcite is very similar to the hi morphology , with the extraplanar gas in the downstream side and compression in the upstream side ( fig .",

    "this strongly suggests that the molecular gas has been influenced by the same mechanism that affects the atomic gas , i.e. ram pressure due to the icm wind . in the upstream side , the interstellar gas can also get compressed by the icm pressure , which potentially results in the formation of molecules as inferred by the excess of co in this side ( see also the example of ngc  4654 ; @xcite ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ pvd ] , the co kinematics also suggests that the icm pressure can disturb the molecular gas , deep inside a galactic potential well . in ngc  4330 and ngc  4402",
    ", the co velocity gradients are quite distinct in the receding and the approaching side , an asymmetry also observed in hi . in the outer part of ngc  4330 and ngc  4402 ( the co clump and the modest co bump , respectively ) where the molecular gas is off from the mid - plane , we also find the velocity gradient deviates from the overall gas flow of the gas disc .",
    "the comparisons with the hi pvd is also intriguing ( the bottom row of fig .  [ pvd ] ) . in the upstream of ngc  4330 and ngc  4402 ,",
    "the velocity gradients of the molecular gas and atomic gas are similar to each other , but they deviate in the downstream . in ngc  4522 ,",
    "the deviation starts at @xmath10.8 kpc from the centre on both sides .",
    "this may indicate a delay in stripping of gas in distinct phases , i.e. more diffuse gas dragged prior to relatively dense gas .",
    "our results clearly show that the molecular gas in galaxies experiencing active hi stripping can become highly asymmetric , as demonstrated by simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , our high - resolution data indicate that the influence of strong icm pressure reaches quite deep inside of the galactic disc .",
    "although molecular gas may be pushed off from the stellar disc together with atomic gas as in ngc  4522 @xcite , active ram pressure does not seem to always cause molecular gas stripping ( ngc  4330 and ngc  4402 ) .",
    "indeed , ngc  4569 , which is thought to have lost more than 90 per cent of its hi gas while crossing the cluster core a few hundred myr ago ( hi deficiency : 1.47 , a projected distance of 1.7 degree ; @xmath10.5 mpc to m87 , the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) , has a comparable molecular gas fraction to optical luminosity of our sma sample ( ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 ) . adopting the h@xmath2 deficiency of @xcite , single - dish measured co fluxes and the mw conversion factor result in @xmath36 of 0.48 , 1.25 , 0.97 and 1.19 for ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 , ngc  4522 and ngc  4569 , respectively .",
    "considering that the sample of @xcite does not include galaxies as faint as ngc  4330 or ngc  4522 , the expected h@xmath2 mass could have been overestimated for these two galaxies .",
    "this supports that molecular gas mass does not necessarily change significantly during and after severe hi stripping , while its detailed molecular gas properties may change .",
    "these changes to the co gas properties are consistent with those from @xcite , who found enhanced levels of warm molecular gas which resulted from additional ism - heating due to ram pressure driven shocks in ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 .",
    "all three galaxies have lost hi gas significantly , containing only @xmath37  @xmath120 per cent of hi mass compared to field galaxies of similar size .",
    "the star formation quenching time - scale , @xmath38 , measured based on the youngest stellar age at the location , where hi gas is truncated ( i.e. one way to estimate how long ago star formation was suppressed in a galaxy ) , ranges from a few tens myr to a few hundreds myr for our sample @xcite .",
    "it is however comparable among the sample within the uncertainties , and they share several properties in common in star formation activity in spite of subtle differences due to the icm wind angle and the projection on the sky as shown in fig .",
    "[ multi ] .",
    "the spatial distributions of co and h@xmath0 ( a tracer of recent star formation with a timescale of @xmath3920 myr ; @xcite ) are remarkably well correlated in the inner few kpc radius ( fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) .",
    "the locations of local co peaks are generally coincident with the h@xmath0 knots as shown by high - resolution data .",
    "the extents and overall morphology are also similar to each other as seen in the comparison with single - dish data , although the h@xmath0 blobs outside the old stellar disc do not always have a co counterpart ( e.g. in both ends of ngc  4330 s fuv disc ; fig .",
    "[ multi]a ) .    meanwhile , fuv ( a star formation tracer of a time - scale of @xmath1100 myr ; @xcite ) is somewhat distinct from co and h@xmath0 in extent and morphology , at least on one side , with fuv being more extended than co and h@xmath0 . although the fuv disc of many field galaxies are larger than their h@xmath0 disc ( e.g. @xcite ) , these three galaxies are distinct from the field population in a sense that both fuv and h@xmath0 are highly truncated within the stellar disc .",
    "these observations indicate that star - forming discs have been shrunk considerably ( by a factor of up to 1.5 ) while undergoing strong ram pressure .",
    "then the question is what causes the quenching of star formation , whether it is molecular gas stripping , the change of molecular gas properties , or both .    as seen by the morphological / kinematical peculiarities of molecular gas in our sample ,",
    "the icm pressure is strong enough to strip the hi gas in the outer disc or push the hi disc to one side , and seems to be able to also affect the molecular gas at a few kpc radii of the stellar disc .",
    "this can cause a number of consequences .",
    "first , in the outer disc where stars must have been formed mostly from low density interstellar gas , star formation activity will gradually decrease as the atomic gas is stripped .",
    "even when quenching starts , some young stars from the last star formation event may be still observable , and indeed , the fuv emission outside co and h@xmath0 discs yet inside the old stellar disc could be good examples of this process .",
    "our sma data suggest that these galaxies are close to or approaching peak pressure @xcite , which is also supported by the results of simulations in the cases of ngc  4330 and ngc  4522 @xcite .",
    "therefore , they will experience strong(er ) ram pressure for a while , losing more hi . as long as hi",
    "is supplied into the disc , the galaxy should be capable of forming molecular gas , keeping up with star formation .",
    "hence , within one galaxy where star formation can be regulated , the fuv morphology should be more or less in good agreement with those of h@xmath0 , which traces more recent star formation on a time - scale of @xmath37 20 myr @xcite .",
    "this is indeed true for isolated galaxies such as the sample of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fuv extent in isolated galaxies is usually smaller than the hi extent as shown in the comparison of radial profiles @xcite . in our galaxies",
    ", however , the h@xmath0 looks much smaller than the fuv disc , and quite distinct in morphology .",
    "this implies that star - forming disc in these galaxies has been shrunken at least in the last 100 myr .        while the outer disc undergoes star formation truncation , the inner disc is also less likely to form stars in the same manner as field galaxies , despite enough molecular gas present . in the upstream side ,",
    "molecular gas is found to be compressed as if it is pushed by the icm pressure .",
    "this can be the result of direct molecular gas compression but also molecular gas excess due to formation from compressed diffuse gas @xcite .",
    "consequently , the star formation rate is likely to be locally increased as @xcite suggested ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we find strong fuv enhancement on the same side where the outer co disc is found to be compressed .    alternatively , this might be the result of the removal of dust due to the icm pressure and hence the upstream side being unveiled .",
    "however , the fuv disc also shows morphological peculiarities and it is quite distinct from the old stellar disc ( e.g. a tail in ngc  4330 , different extents and scale heights of ngc  4402 , extraplanar fuv emission in ngc  4522 ) , which can not be explained by dust stripping alone .",
    "in addition , more evidence for increased star formation due to gas compression by the icm pressure has been found in other galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , which also seems to be the case in our sample .",
    "local fuv enhancements found near co compression within the old stellar disc ( such as the north - east of ngc  4330 , the east of ngc  4402 and the south - east of ngc  4522 ) can be good examples of induced star formation by ram pressure ( figs  [ n4330]e[n4522]e and figs  [ multi]a  c )",
    ".    some interstellar gas removed from the main stellar disc yet lingering around in a galactic halo may be re - accreted onto the disc after core crossing .",
    "ngc  4569 shown in fig .",
    "[ multi](d ) , is known to be such case .",
    "the single - arm structure in hi agrees well in morphology and kinematics with a model of stripped gas falling back to the galaxy , which assumes that the galaxy is currently moving away from the cluster centre after crossing the core @xmath1a few hundreds myr ago @xcite .",
    "its star formation quenching time - scale estimated by @xcite is also somewhat longer than our sma sample by @xmath1100 myr or so , indicating that this galaxy has experienced strong icm pressure relatively longer ago than the other three galaxies .",
    "what is intriguing in the case of ngc  4569 is that the extent of the fuv disc is comparable to that of the h@xmath0 and co ( fig .  [",
    "multi]d ) . in this case , the star formation is limited in the central region of the galaxy as most of the hi gas at larger galactic radii is stripped .",
    "some gas can be re - obtained but not enough gas is left to replenish the entire disc .",
    "therefore , the fuv extent can decrease to a similar size as the h@xmath0 extent because fuv emission may fade as time goes by , if molecular gas can not be replenished because the atomic gas has been stripped . at this stage",
    ", it is similar to isolated galaxies in a sense that fuv is overall well correlated with h@xmath0/co , but now the star - forming disc is somewhat shrunken in comparison to what it used to be during active hi stripping or before .",
    "the three galaxies that we observed using the sma are expected to go through a similar evolutionary sequence and will be found with a truncated fuv disc of a comparable size to the h@xmath0 and co disc within their old stellar disc .",

    "are adopted from the model of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the shaded region indicates the range of possible orbital velocities at a given projected clustercentric distance . to estimate the restoring force",
    "at given galactic radii , we take the mean molecular gas and the hi gas surface densities along the major axis from the radial profiles ( i.e. figs  [ n4330]c[n4522]c ) using our sma co data and the hi data ( viva ; @xcite ) . hence , in this calculation we do not include the iram data of ngc  4522 , and therefore the restoring force of this case in fig .",
    "[ restore ] is only the lower limit of the lowest possible value .",
    "the parameters used to estimate the restoring force and ram pressure are summarized in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "our rough estimate suggests that it is not impossible to remove the molecular gas in the very outer region in some circumstances .",
    "however , by adopting the rotational velocity of the co disc , which in all cases has a radius less than 5 kpc , we are focused on a region whose potential is dominated by the stellar component , not the dark matter halo . therefore , in practice , the actual stripping of molecular gas must be more difficult than our estimation . also , depending on the encounter angle between the icm wind and the galactic disc , the inner molecular gas can be better shielded , which will make the stripping even harder .",
    "lastly , considering that the ism is one entity after all and the total gas surface density of the two phases is more appropriate for more realistic estimation , the chance for the molecular gas to get stripped can be even less .",
    "in addition , even if molecular gas is pushed off from the galactic disc , whether the extraplanar molecular gas leaves the galactic halo for good or partially comes back is still debatable . considering that cluster galaxies are not significantly different from their field counterpart in co luminosity @xcite , the molecular gas completely stripped out of a galaxy is inferred to be a very small fraction .",
    "our estimate is , however , only the prediction for how easy or hard it is to remove the molecular gas from a galaxy completely , and the molecular gas can be still disturbed without stripping , as our data clearly show .",
    "in fact , the recent result by @xcite that severely hi - deficient galaxies tend to be found with lower molecular gas surface density may simply reflect the fact that the molecular gas of galaxies under strong icm pressure is perturbed , not necessarily implying molecular gas being deficient .",
    "extraplanar molecular gas may also form new stars ( e.g. eso  137 - 001 with a prominent rps tail found in a massive cluster , abell  3627 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fuv emission with several h@xmath0 knots along the hi tail of ngc  4330 and the extraplanar fuv / h@xmath0 emission in ngc  4522 might be such a case .",
    "outside the old stellar disc , stars may form in two ways , from stripped molecular gas , or alternatively from newly formed molecular gas . indeed , @xcite in their simulations show that stripped diffuse gas can form dense molecular gas by cooling process , which can possibly form new stars .",
    "however , in extraplanar space , it is questionable how efficiently stripped atomic hydrogen can be pressurized , turning into molecular form @xcite .",
    "therefore , star formation taking place outside the main disc is more likely to be utilizing the molecular gas that is pushed from the main disc but has not left the galactic halo .    as in ngc  4522 , however , there are several extraplanar h@xmath0 regions with no detectable co. this suggests that the h@xmath2 gas depletion time - scale ( @xmath62 ) in extraplanar space can be much shorter than what it is on the disc ( of the order of a few gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath62 at the location of h@xmath0/co blob is measured to be comparable to what is normally found in the galactic disc ( see appendix b ) .",
    "therefore , there might be some extraplanar co even in ngc  4330 and ngc  4402 , but with mass smaller than our detectability or that of the iram @xcite .    together with this",
    ", there is also an important difference between ngc  4330 and ngc  4522 , which is the presence of co in the extraplanar star formation region . in the case of ngc  4330 ,",
    "more rapidly increasing ram pressure compared to ngc  4522 might be responsible for faster dissociation of molecular cloud , and hence absence of co along the fuv tail .",
    "alternatively , some fraction of stripped molecular gas might be destroyed by high - energy photon emitted from massive young stars @xcite",
    ". therefore extraplanar or stripped co may not be always observable even if it is pushed off from the stellar disc .",
    "in this work , we have presented high - resolution 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) data obtained using the sma of three virgo spirals , ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 , which are undergoing active hi stripping due to ram pressure . by comparing with single - dish 12co ( 2@xmath31 ) ,",

    "most important results from our study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the overall co morphology and kinematics are quite asymmetric and disturbed .",
    "morphological peculiarities found in co are closely related to hi morphology in these galaxies , indicating that molecular gas is also affected by the ram pressure .",
    "we find the co clump in the south - west of ngc  4330 ( figs  [ n4330]a  c ) and the modest co bump in the north - west of ngc  4402 ( figs  [ n4402]a  c ) , with distinct velocity structure from the overall velocity gradient of the molecular disc .",
    "this also supports the idea that molecular gas can be displaced by the external pressure inside a stellar disc .",
    "3 .   both fuv and h@xmath0 are enhanced where hi and co are compressed , supporting that ram pressure can also trigger star formation temporarily ( e.g. figs  [ n4402]d  f of ngc  4402 ) . in these galaxies",
    ", however , fuv shows distinct morphology and extent from those of co , while h@xmath0 and co are overall in good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) .",
    "the large offset between fuv and h@xmath0 must indicate the star formation has been recently quenched , likely over the last 100 myr as the molecular gas properties have changed .",
    "4 .   to compare with ngc  4569 ( fig .",
    "[ multi]d ) , which is thought to have already crossed the cluster core , the offset between fuv and h@xmath0/co is expected to smooth out over time ( @xmath1a few hundreds myr ) after the core crossing as the galaxy further loses hi , i.e. the capability of forming molecular gas , and star formation is completely shut down at large galactic radii .    in summary ,",
    "our results suggest that a strong icm pressure not only strips diffuse atomic gas but also changes the properties of dense molecular gas in the inner few kpc of a galaxy .",
    "molecular gas can be pushed from the stellar disc in the outer part as reported in previous studies , yet we find that molecular gas is less likely to be completely stripped from a galaxy . on the side where the icm pressure acts , molecular gas can be enhanced by compression and molecular formation from atomic gas , locally increasing star formation .",
    "as the gas is rapidly used up , the star - forming disc will decrease in size as no sufficient atomic gas is left to form more molecular gas . on the opposite side , molecular gas can be perturbed in a way that reflects the atomic gas , which may prevent a galaxy from forming stars as before , i.e. injecting turbulence into molecular gas is likely to cause star formation rates to be inefficient @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two effects must be an important driver that makes galaxies evolve to become passive in the cluster environment .    in order to investigate the molecular gas properties and its conditions for star formation under strong icm pressure more quantitatively",
    ", we are currently probing the density and temperature of molecular gas using multitransitions and isotopes of co ( lee et al . in preparation ) .",
