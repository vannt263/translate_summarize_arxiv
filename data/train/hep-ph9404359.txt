    "<S> this phenomenon was first recognized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in some cases the dip dominates , such that the signal for the presence of the higgs boson is a small _ deficit _ in the production of @xmath2 pairs of invariant mass near the higgs mass .    </S>",

    "<S> our qualitative results are generic to the scenario where the dominant decay of the higgs boson is to top quarks . </S>",
    "<S> if the ratio of vacuum - expectation values is much larger than unity , the coupling of @xmath7 to the top quark is suppressed and its coupling to the bottom quark enhanced , such that the production of the higgs via a bottom - quark loop , and its decay to @xmath8 , become non - negligible . in the case of a non - supersymmetric </S>",

    "<S> we see that the interference of the absorptive part of the loop diagram with the tree diagram yields an exact zero at the resonance energy , @xmath36 ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop - induced coupling due to the dispersive part of the loop produces the usual resonant peak , so generically a peak - dip structure results . if the dispersive part of the loop is small compared with the absorptive part , the dip will be the dominant feature of the structure in the invariant - mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this is what occurs for @xmath32 700 and 800 gev in figs .  2 and 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> peak - dip structures due to final - state interactions are well - known in hadronic physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a dip is the effect of the @xmath42 on the @xmath43 invariant - mass spectrum in double - diffractive pion production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that a peak - dip structure in the @xmath2 invariant - mass spectrum results whenever there is a resonant final - state interaction of the @xmath2 pair , regardless of the physics which produces the resonant final - state interaction . </S>",

    "<S> it also shows that the peak - dip structure is not washed out by qcd corrections , since it depends only on the final - state interaction of the @xmath2 pair , whose production may in principle be calculated to any order in qcd .    at the fermilab tevatron , </S>",
    "<S> a top quark of mass greater than 150 gev is predominantly produced via quark - antiquark annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath23 170 gev , the gluon - fusion contribution to the total top - quark cross section is about @xmath44 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus any structure in the @xmath45 cross section due to a higgs boson would be buried beneath the @xmath46 continuum , and require very large statistics to uncover . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at a higher - energy hadron collider , such as the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the gluon - fusion process is the dominant source of top quarks . at a 4 tev @xmath47 collider , </S>",
    "<S> the gluon - fusion process accounts for about half of the total top - quark cross section ( for @xmath48 170 gev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 invariant mass can be reconstructed at hadron colliders via @xmath49 , followed by hadronic decay of one @xmath50 boson and leptonic decay of the other . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two @xmath50 bosons and two top quarks constrains the kinematics sufficiently that the event can be fully reconstructed , in principle . </S>",
    "<S> we assume in the following that the @xmath2 invariant mass can be reconstructed with reasonable resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons on the @xmath2 invariant - mass distribution is quite small , and will require large statistics to observe . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the peak and dip in the invariant - mass distribution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 due to a scalar higgs of mass 500 gev are each about a @xmath51 effect , each contained in a bin of width about 25 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical significance of the peak and dip depend on the number of @xmath2 events in the mass bin containing the signal . </S>",
    "<S> we present in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 the luminosity function of gluon - gluon collisions at hadron colliders of various energy . </S>",
    "<S> multiplication of the @xmath0 cross section in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 and 3 at a given invariant mass , @xmath52 , by the luminosity function at the same invariant mass yields the inclusive hadronic differential cross section , @xmath53 , for @xmath54 . at the lhc , with 100 @xmath55 of integrated luminosity , the raw number of events in an invariant - mass bin of width 25 gev at @xmath56 500 gev is about @xmath57 . including a branching ratio for the one hadronic - one leptonic decay of the @xmath50 bosons of about 0.3 , and a factor of 1/3 to account for acceptance and efficiencies , </S>",
    "<S> leaves approximately @xmath58 events . </S>",
    "<S> this is far more than necessary to detect a @xmath51 effect at the @xmath59 level . for a scalar higgs of mass 800 gev </S>",
    "<S> , the dip corresponds to a @xmath60 decrease in the number of events in a bin of width 50 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the number of events , including branching ratios , acceptance , and efficiencies , is about @xmath61 , yielding a significance of about 3.5@xmath62 for the signal , marginally significant . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the pseudoscalar higgs are comparable .    </S>",
    "<S> lower - energy machines also have the potential to observe a signal , depending on the luminosity and the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> a 4 tev @xmath47 collider requires about 100 @xmath55 of integrated luminosity to detect a scalar higgs of mass 500 gev with a 5@xmath62 significance . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fermilab tevatron would require an integrated luminosity far in excess of 100 @xmath55 to detect such a higgs boson .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the class of models being considered here , in the standard higgs model the branching ratio of the higgs boson to @xmath2 is much less than unity . for @xmath23 170 </S>",
    "<S> gev , the branching ratio is at most @xmath63 ( this value occurs for @xmath64 500 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson produces only a tiny wiggle in the @xmath2 invariant - mass spectrum at the higgs mass , too small to appear in figs .  2 or 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the peak - dip structure in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution , due to a scalar or pseudoscalar higgs boson decaying principally to top quarks , is potentially observable at the lhc , if the @xmath2 invariant - mass resolution is less than the width of the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> although the standard - model higgs boson is not of this type , higgs bosons which decay predominantly to top quarks are natural in two - higgs - doublet models , in particular the heavy scalar higgs , @xmath7 , and the pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath25 , of the minimal supersymmetric model . </S>",
    "<S> the peak - dip structure is unfortunately not observable at the fermilab tevatron with 1 @xmath55 of integrated luminosity , due to the limited statistics and the relatively large rate of production of top quarks via quark - antiquark annihilation . </S>"
