    "the relative differences of the neutron and the proton distributions in this region are sensitive to the symmetry energy at the subsaturation densities .",

    "more surprising is that the neutron skin in @xmath3pb is also linearly correlated with the parameter @xmath0 what has been observed previously @xcite ( see the right panel of fig .",

    ". however , the values of the parameter @xmath0 of the slope of symmetry energy at saturation are varying more substantially among the different theoretical models @xcite . as @xmath32 varies in a much narrower range than @xmath0 in the nuclear models , and as if @xmath32 is larger ( smaller ) also @xmath0 is usually larger ( smaller ) , eq .

    "( 4 ) on the total neutron skin thickness can be estimated . in the case of",
    "@xmath3pb we have obtained values from around 0.035 fm to around 0.055 fm in various nuclear models .",
    "these numbers mean that diffuseness term can contribute as much as 20% to 40% to the total neutron skin thickness and they are too large to be omitted .",
    "moreover , the neutron skin thickness calculated in the droplet model including the diffuseness term is very close to extended thomas - fermi predictions , whereas without this term the two models differ significantly .",
    "these results show that the assumption of equal surface diffuseness of neutrons and protons is not consistent with mean - field predictions of density distribution in a nucleus .",
    "the experimental neutron skins deduced from the antiprotonic atoms @xcite presented in fig . 2 show a linear increase of neutron skin with @xmath33 .",
    "this trend is consistent with the droplet model prediction in eq .",
    "( 4 ) . since we have shown that the slope of the neutron skin with @xmath33 depends on the parameter @xmath0 ( see eq . ( 7 ) ) , the value of this parameter may be constrained by experimental data .",

    "2 , reproduces average increasing trend of measurements . from the fitting procedure including the diffuseness term ,",
    "we have found the value of @xmath34 mev for the slope of symmetry energy , which points towards a `` soft '' nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the uncertainty of the value of @xmath0 comes from large experimental errorbars of the measurements .",
    "two basic scenarios leading to create neutrons skin can be distinguished .",
    "they are schematically shown in fig .",
    "3 . in the first type , called `` skin '' mode , the neutron surface is shifted outwards the proton surface .",
    "the alternative scenario is an increasing of the diffuseness of the neutron surface relative to the proton one .",
    "it is called the `` halo '' mode . when two parameter fermi ( 2pf ) function @xmath35 } } \\ ] ] is assumed for the neutron and the proton density distributions , both types of neutron skin",
    "are easy to classify .",
    "the `` skin '' mode corresponds to 2pf parametrization with @xmath36 , whereas the pure `` halo '' mode is obtained with @xmath37 .",
    "the central density is not properly reproduced by the sharp - edge sphere of a radius @xmath38 with the volume conservation condition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned `` skin '' and `` halo '' definitions do not correspond to the droplet model expression for the neutron skin thickness and can not be directly related to the particular terms in the neutron skin formula in eq .",
    "( 4 ) . instead",
    ", we propose to use the `` bulk '' and the `` surface '' contributions @xcite .",
    "they are based on the same idea as the `` skin '' and the `` halo '' types but with special attention paid on preservation of the properties of the interior of a nucleus by the `` bulk '' part .",
    "this contribution is defined through the equivalent sharp - edge radii @xcite of neutrons @xmath39 and protons @xmath40 @xmath41\\ ] ] the remaining part of neutron skin thickness states the `` surface '' contribution . @xmath42 as it is clear from eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , the `` bulk '' and the `` surface '' contributions can be also easily expressed by the 2pf parameters .    in fig .",
    "4 the neutron skin thickness calculated with the skm * parameter set is plotted for the nuclei investigated in the antiprotonic atom measurements as a function of neutron excess @xmath33 . a linear increasing trend of neutron skin thickness can be easily noticed .",
    "the `` bulk '' and the `` surface '' contributions calculated for the same nuclei are also plotted in fig . 4 . to obtain these values the mean - field density distributions",
    "have been parametrized by the 2pf profile .",
    "special care was taken on the precise reproduction of the surface region .",
    "the `` bulk '' contribution roughly shows a linear increasing trend as the total neutron skin with a similar slope . in the light nuclei with small @xmath33",
    "this contribution is negative due to the dominant influence of the coulomb repulsion . in the heavy nuclei",
    "it grows up and states roughly one third of the total value of neutron skin .",
    "the `` surface '' contribution is very scattered especially in the light nuclei . in the region of the large neutron excess",
    "this part remains at the same level and does not change significantly with @xmath33 .",
    "it seems that single - particle effects in particular nucleus have an important influence on the surface region of some nuclei what impacts strongly on the `` surface '' part of neutron skin . on the other side ,",
    "the `` bulk '' contribution is governed by the classical liquid drop properties of nuclei and the influence of quantal effects is limited .    in the sn isotopic chain",
    "the single - particle influence on the nuclear density distribution is limited to shell structure of neutrons .",
    "the increasing trend of neutron skin as well as both `` bulk '' and `` surface '' contributions can be noticed . again",
    "neutron skin thickness is composed of the both contributions .",
    "shell effects are pronounced at magic numbers ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "a huge increase of the `` surface '' part can be noticed in the mid - shell nuclei whereas there is a kink with a local minimum for doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the `` bulk '' contribution shows up opposite and less pronounced behaviour . the `` surface '' part is larger than the `` bulk '' one in most of the nuclei of the tin chain",

    "polarized electrons are scattered on the @xmath3pb target .",
    "electrons couple with protons mainly via the electromagnetic ( @xmath46 ) interaction and with neutrons via the weak interaction ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "for ultra - relativistic electrons , as in prex conditions , the weak potential has opposite sign depending on the polarization ( helicity ) of the electron beam .",
    "therefore , the elastic differential crosssection of right - handed ( @xmath48 ) electrons is different to the one measured for left - handed ( @xmath49 ) electrons .",
    "the difference of these cross sections allows one to define the parity violating asymmetry : @xmath50 it is measured at prex at the fixed energy of @xmath51 gev and the scattering angle of about @xmath52 ( @xmath53 @xmath54 ) .",
    "we calculate the elastic differential cross sections of @xmath55pb for a polarized electron beam by means of the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite . for",
    "that we have modified the code used in ref .  @xcite . in short ,",
    "the dwba consist on the exact phase shift analysis of the dirac equation , @xmath56\\psi_e = e\\psi_e \\label{dirac}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the electron wave function and @xmath58 is the electroweak potential felt by the ultra - relativistic electron beam depending on their helicity .",
    "the connection between the parity violating asymmetry and the neutron skin thickness of a nucleus can be qualitatively understood from the analytical expression of the former within the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) , @xmath59 , \\ ] ] where the neutron and proton formfactors @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , are also written in pwba .",
    "therefore , in the low - momentum transfer regime , @xmath62 and @xmath63 explicitly depend on the factor @xmath64 .",
    "for realistic results , however , one can not use the simple pwba and full dwba calculations must be performed @xcite .    in fig .",
    "5 the parity violating asymmetry in @xmath3pb calculated in dwba for a large sample of successful nuclear forces is plotted versus the neutron skin thickness calculated for the same parametrizations .",
    "models that fail to predict the well - known charge radius and binding energy of @xmath3pb are not allowed in fig .",
    "5 . a very good linear correspondence of the parity violating asymmetry and the neutron skin thickness is found . from the measurement of the parity violating asymmetry ,",
    "the neutron skin can be easily deduced using linear dependence of fig . 5 : @xmath65    from this relation , taking into account that all models properly reproduce proton rms radius",
    ", one can notice that the expected 3% errorbars of @xmath66 should allow to obtain the neutron radius of @xmath3pb with 1% uncertainty .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 with the green errobars plotted at the arbitrary chosen value of @xmath66 .",
    "the prex experiment completed a successful run in 2010 .",

    "5 by the thick red errorbar , does not indicate on the forces which properly describe both the parity violating asymmetry as well as neutron skin .",
    "the prex - ii proposal aims to improve the accuracy of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the slope of symmetry energy parameter @xmath0 can be also calculated for each force presented in fig .",
    "5 . as @xmath66 is linear with @xmath68 and @xmath69 is linear with @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) we may also expect a linear relation between @xmath66 and @xmath0 . from the confrontation of these two quantities we can find a nice correlation with average fitted line @xcite @xmath70",
    "the prex experiment can provide information not only about the neutron skin in @xmath3pb but also the independent estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "we have discussed various aspects of neutron skin and its relations to the symmetry energy of nuclear matter .",
    "the linear relation between the thickness of neutron skin and the slope of the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath0 has been proven . with the use of this correlation",
    "we have deduced from the neutron skin measurements in the antiprotonic atoms relatively small value of @xmath71 mev which hints the soft character of symmetry energy .",
    "neutron skin can be produced as a result of the shift of the neutron surface in relation to the proton one ( the `` bulk '' type ) , or due to the differences in the surface thickness of proton and neutron matter in a nucleus ( the `` surface '' type ) . in the general case",
