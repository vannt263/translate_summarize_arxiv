    "reliable simulations of biomolecules are one of nowadays grand challenges of computational science . in particular the problem of protein folding thermodynamics starting purely from an aminino - acid sequence has received major attention . until recently the prevailing view has been that it is elusive to search for the native states with present day simulational techniques due to limitations of time scale and force field accuracy .",
    "now a barrier appears to be broken , as it was reported  @xcite that large scale distributed computing allows to achieve folding of the 23-residue design mini - protein bba5 , which is relatively insensitive to inaccuracies of the force field .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of the computer simulation is found to be in good agreement with the experimentally observed folding times and equilibrium constants .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) technics , for a review see  @xcite , tend to be the method of first choice for simulations of biomolecules .",
    "one of the attractive features of md is that it allows to follow the physical time evolution of the system under investigation .",
    "nevertheless , there has also been activity based on the metropolis method  @xcite , which allows only for limited dynamical insights and has its strength in the generation of configurations which are in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "a major advantage of metropolis simulations of biomolecules is that they allows for updates which are large moves when one has to follow dynamical trajectories .",
    "such updates may help to overcome the kinetic trapping problem , which is due to a large number of local minima in the free energy space of typical biomolecules .",
    "already metropolis simulations of the canonical gibbs - boltzmann ensemble may jump certain barriers . using _ generalized ensembles _ , which enlarge the gibbs - boltzmann ensemble and/or replace the canonical weights by other weighting factors , further progress has been made .",
    "for reviews see  @xcite .    to my knowledge _ umbrella sampling _",
    "@xcite was the first generalized ensemble method of the literature .",
    "its potential for applications to a wide range of interesting physical problems remained for a long time dormant .",
    "apparently , one reason was that the computational scientists in various areas shied away from performing simulations with an a - priori unknown weighting factor .",
    "as li and scheraga put it  @xcite : `` the difficulty of finding such a weighting factor has prevented wide applications of the `` umbrella sampling '' method to many physical systems . ''",
    "this changed with the introduction of the multicanonical approach  @xcite to complex systems  @xcite .",
    "besides having the luck that the controversy surrounding its first application got quickly resolved by analytical results  @xcite , the multicanonical approach addressed aggressively the problem of finding reliable weights . nowadays",
    "a starter kit of fortran programs is available on the web  @xcite .",
    "the replica exchange or parallel tempering ( pt ) method  @xcite uses a generalized ensemble which enlarges the canonical configuration space by allowing for the exchange of temperatures within a set of canonical ensembles . in this and other generalized ensembles",
    "the metropolis dynamics at low temperatures can be accelerated by excursions to disordered configurations at higher temperatures .",
    "note that , in contrast to multicanonical simulations , the probabilities of canonically rare configurations are not enhanced by pt . for the purpose of simulating biomolecules",
    "pt was , e.g. , studied in ref.@xcite .    in this article",
    "we discuss a biased updating scheme  @xcite , which enhances already the dynamics of canonical metropolis simulations and is easily integrated into generalized ensemble simulations too .",
    "the latter point is illustrated for parallel tempering .",
    "the biased updating scheme is inspired by the funnel picture of protein folding  @xcite .",
    "at relatively high temperatures probability densities of the dynamical variables are estimated and used at lower temperatures to enhance the chance of update proposals to lie in the statistically relevant regions of the configuration space . in some sense",
    "this is nothing else but an elaboration of the original importance sampling concept of metropolis et al.@xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "all - atom protein models , the funnel picture and the rugged metropolis updating are introduced in the next section . in the subsequent section numerical results",
    "are presented for the brain peptide met - enkephalin .",
    "a short summary and conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "proteins are linear polymers of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids .",
    "small proteins are called peptides .",
    "the problem of protein folding is to predict ( at room temperature and in solvents ) the 3d conformations ( native structures ) from the sequence of amino acids .",
    "a conformational energy function models the interactions between the atoms ( units kcal / mol ) : @xmath2 the contributions to the energy function are ( charges are in units of the elementary charge ) : @xmath3\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solvent accessible surface method allows for an approximative inclusion of solvent interactions : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the solvation parameter for atom @xmath6 and @xmath7 the conformation dependent solvent accessible surface area .",
    "the @xmath8 are the distances between the atoms and the @xmath9 are the torsion angles for the chemical bonds . the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are determined from crystal structures of amino acids and a number of thus obtained force fields are given in the literature .",
    "bond length and angles fluctuate little and are normally set constant .",
    "the important degrees of freedom are the dihedral angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , see fig.[fig_dia ] .     ]     ]    the funnel picture of bryngelson and wolyness  @xcite gives qualitative insight into the process of protein folding , see fig.[fig_funnel ] , where a schematic sketch of the free energy versus a suitable _ reaction coordinate _ is given",
    ". however , there is no generical definition of a good reaction coordinate , as the funnel lives in the high - dimensional configuration space .",
    "here we give a parameter free funnel description  @xcite from higher to lower temperatures , which suggests a method for designing the a - priori metropolis weights for simulations of biomolecules .",
    "to be definite , we use the all - atom energy function  @xcite ecepp/2 ( empirical conformational energy program for peptides ) .",
    "our dynamical variables @xmath14 are then the dihedral angles , each chosen to be in the range @xmath15 , so that the volume of the configuration space is @xmath16 .",
    "let us define the _ support _ of a pd of the dihedral angles .",
    "the support of a pd is the region of configuration space where the protein wants to be .",
    "mathematically , we define @xmath17 to be the smallest sub - volume of the configuration space for which @xmath18 holds . here",
    "@xmath19 is a probability , which ought to be chosen close to one , e.g. , @xmath20 .",
    "the free energy landscape at temperature @xmath21 is called _ rugged _ , if the support of the pd consists of many disconnected parts ( this depends of course a bit on the adapted values for @xmath22 and `` many '' ) .",
    "that a protein folds at room temperature , say @xmath23 , into a unique native structure @xmath24 means that its pd @xmath25 describes small fluctuation around this structure .",
    "we are now ready to formulate the funnel picture in terms of pds @xmath26 which are ordered by the temperatures @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 the sequence  ( [ rho_r ] ) constitutes a protein _ funnel _ when , for a reasonable choice of the probability @xmath22 and the temperatures  ( [ t_order ] ) , the following holds :    1 .",
    "the pds are rugged .",
    "the support of a pd at lower temperature is contained in the support of a pd at higher temperature @xmath29 e.g. for @xmath20 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   with decreasing temperatures @xmath27 the support @xmath32 shrinks towards small fluctuations around the native structure .",
    "properties 2 and 3 are fulfilled for many systems of statistical physics , when some groundstate stands in for the native structure .",
    "the remarkable point is that they may still hold for complex systems with a rugged free energy landscape , i.e. , with property  1 added . in such systems",
    "one finds typically local free energy minima , which are of negligible statistical importance at low temperatures , while populated at higher temperatures . in simulations at low temperatures the problem of the canonical ensemble approach",
    "is that the updating tends to get stuck in those local minima .",
    "this prevents convergence towards the native structure on realistic simulation time scales .",
    "on the other hand , the simulations move quite freely at higher temperatures , where the native structure is of negligible statistical weight .",
    "nevertheless , the support of a protein pd may already be severely restricted , as we shall illustrate .",
    "the idea is to use a relatively easily calculable pd at a higher temperature to improve the performance of the simulation at a lower temperature .",
    "the metropolis importance sampling would be perfected , if we could propose new configurations @xmath33 with their canonical pd @xmath34 . due to the funnel property",
    "2 we expect that an _ estimate _",
    "@xmath35 from some sufficiently close - by higher temperature @xmath36 will feed useful information into the simulation at temperature @xmath21 . the potential for computational gains is large because of the funnel property  3 .",
    "the suggested scheme for the metropolis updating at temperature @xmath27 is to propose new configurations @xmath33 with the pd @xmath37 and to accept them with the probability @xmath38\\ .\\ ] ] this equation biases the a - priori probability of each dihedral angle with an estimate of its pd from a higher temperature . in previous literature",
    "@xcite such a biased updating has been used for the @xmath39 theory , where it is efficient to propose @xmath40 at each lattice size @xmath6 with its single - site probability .",
    "for our temperatures @xmath27 the ordering  ( [ t_order ] ) is assumed .",
    "with the definition @xmath41 the simulation at the highest temperature , @xmath42 , is performed with the usual metropolis algorithm .",
    "we have thus a recursive scheme , called rugged metropolis ( rm ) in the following .",
    "when @xmath43 is always a useful approximation of @xmath44 , the scheme zooms in on the native structure , because the pd at @xmath45 governs its fluctuations .    to get things working , we need to construct an estimator @xmath46 from the numerical data of the rm simulation at temperature @xmath27 .",
    "although this is neither simple nor straightforward , a variety of approaches offer themselves to define and refine the desired estimators . in the following we work with the approximation @xmath47 where the @xmath48 are estimators of reduced one - variable pds defined by @xmath49 the implementation of the resulting algorithm , called rm@xmath50 , is straightforward , as estimators of the one - variable reduced pds are easily obtained from the time series of a simulation .",
    "the cpu time consumption of rm@xmath50 is practically identical with the one of the conventional metropolis algorithm .",
    "to illustrate the developed ideas , we rely on the brain peptide met - enkephalin , which is a numerically well - studied  @xcite .",
    "met - enkephalin is determined by the amino - acid sequence tyr ",
    "gly  gly  phe  met or , in the short notation , y  g  g  f  m , where @xmath51 our simulations are performed with a variant of smmp  @xcite ( simple molecular dynamics for protein ) using fully variable @xmath52 torsion angles .",
    "for the data analysis we keep a times series by writing out configurations every 32 sweeps .     ]",
    "fig.[fig_dia13 ] show the probability densities of the dihedral angle @xmath53 ( for the notation see table  [ tab_vac_auto ] ) at 400@xmath54k and 300@xmath54k .",
    "this angle is chosen because it illustrates the possibility of large moves in the metropolis updating , which jump barriers of a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "namely , a single update may take us directly from each of the three populated regions to each other , whereas one encounters barriers when one has to move in small increments @xmath55 .    to evaluate the relative performance of different algorithms",
    ", we measure the integrated autocorrelation times @xmath56 for the energy and each dihedral angle .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation times are directly proportional to the computer run times needed to achieve the same statistical accuracy . for an observable @xmath57",
    "the autocorrelations are @xmath58 where @xmath59 labels the computer time . defining @xmath60 , the time - dependent integrated autocorrelation time is given by @xmath61 formally the integrated autocorrelation time",
    "@xmath56 is defined by @xmath62 .",
    "numerically this limit can not be reached as the noise of the estimator increases faster than the signal .",
    "nevertheless , one can calculate reliable estimates by reaching a window of @xmath59 values for which @xmath63 becomes flat , while its error bars are still reasonably small .    .",
    "integrated autocorrelation times .",
    "[ tab_vac_auto ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     columns  5 and  6 of table  [ tab_vac_auto ] collect our estimates of the integrated autocorrelation times from conventional , canonical metropolis simulations at 400@xmath54k and 300@xmath54k .",
    "we find a remarkable slowing down .",
    "for the energy , which is characteristic for the over - all behavior , @xmath56 increases by a factor of about ten . for certain angles , e.g. @xmath64 , @xmath56 increases",
    "even by factors larger than twenty . at 400@xmath54k conventional metropolis simulations allow to calculate observables with relative ease , while this is no longer the case at 300@xmath54k .",
    "our aim is to use information from the 400@xmath54k simulation to improve on the performance at 300@xmath54k .",
    "k and 400@xmath54k .",
    "[ fig_energy ] ]    one finds that the energy histograms of the 400@xmath54k and the 300@xmath54k simulation have a considerable overlap , see fig.[fig_energy ] .",
    "therefore , the two temperatures are well - suited to be combined into a pt  @xcite simulation .",
    "we abstain here from introducing additional temperatures , because our aim is to get a clear understanding of the improvement of the 300@xmath54k simulation due to pt input from 400@xmath54k .",
    "k. [ fig_auto ] ]    in fig.[fig_auto ] integrated autocorrelations times for the energy variable are compared at 300@xmath54k .",
    "the order of the curves agrees with the order in the figure legend . from up to down : conventional canonical metropolis simulation , rm@xmath50 improved canonical metropolis simulation with input from 400@xmath54k , pt simulation coupled to 400@xmath54k and the rm@xmath50 improved pt simulation .",
    "the variable @xmath59 of equation  ( [ tau_int_t ] ) is given in units of 32 sweeps due to the way our data are recorded . in the range shown , i.e. up to @xmath65 sweeps , a window exist for the pt and the rm@xmath50 improved pt simulations , which allows to estimate the integrated autocorrelation times of these simulations . for the other two simulations",
    "one has to go to even larger @xmath59 values , but it remain possible to estimate @xmath56 . for the energy and all 24 dihedral angles the @xmath56 estimates are collected in table  [ tab_vac_auto ] .    for the energy we find a decrease from @xmath66 to @xmath67 due to the rm@xmath50 improvement of the canonical metropolis simulation , i.e. approximately a factor of  2 .",
    "the pt improvement of this simulation is even larger , namely from @xmath66 to @xmath68 , i.e. approximately a factor of 2.5 . in both cases",
    "the cpu time spent at 400@xmath54k is not part of the equation .",
    "this is justified as one should anyway understand the system first at temperatures where one does not suffer from long autocorrelation times .",
    "for pt the factor 2.5 is the improvement in real time when two identical pc nodes with some parallel software like mpi ( message passing interface ) are available .",
    "most remarkably , the two improvements multiply : for the rm@xmath50 improved pt simulation the autocorrelation time is down to @xmath69 , only about one more factor of two away from the @xmath56 value at 400@xmath54k .",
    "inspection of the @xmath56 values for the 24 dihedral angles shows large differences . for the conventional canonical simulation",
    "the range is from means that our resolution of measurements every 32 sweeps is too crude to show the autocorrelations , which one may still expect on the scale of a few sweeps . ]",
    "@xmath70 for @xmath71 to @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "for the pt - rm@xmath50 simulation it becomes reduced to a range from @xmath70 to @xmath68 .",
    "this suggests that it is not efficient to simulate by sweeps , where each dihedral angle is updated once per sweep . instead",
    ", an algorithm ( systematic or random ) where the number of updates per angle is proportional to its integrated autocorrelation time is expected to be more efficient .",
    "obviously , this can be implemented without major changes of the existing code , but tests of this idea have not yet been completed .",
    "after all these improvements the 300@xmath54k simulation is expected to be no more autocorrelated than the conventional , canonical simulation at 400@xmath54k .",
    "all - atom metropolis simulations of small biomolecules deserve a place on their own in the arsenal of computational biophysics .",
    "a good understanding of smaller pieces of a larger protein is one of the ingredients , which can pave the way towards the understanding of large systems like proteins .",
    "major algorithmic problems remain to be solved before metropolis simulations of all - atom models may become directly suitable for applications like the folding of small to medium sized proteins .",
    "one algorithmic problem is that of correlated moves of two or more dihedral angles .",
    "such moves promise to overcome ( jump ) essential free energy barriers in the case of larger molecules . within conventional canonical metropolis simulations",
    "the acceptance rates for simultaneous moves of two and more angles are prohibitively small .",
    "the rm concept promises major inroads , but details have not yet been tested out .",
    "an even more challenging problem is the inclusion of solvent effects . here",
    "the large moves of metropolis updates create the _ cavity problem_. we need a cavity in the surrounding water to accommodate the move and updates of the dihedral angles do not create one .",
    "this appears to be one of the major reasons why large scale simulations of proteins with a surrounding solvent are to an overwhelming extent done within the md framework , where the cavity problem is avoided due to joint , small moves of all degrees of freedoms . within the metropolis approach effective solvent models",
    "may provide a solution .",
    "they are , e.g. , defined by a solvent contribution like @xmath74 in eq.([e_sol ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , no reliable determination of the parameters entering this equation exists presently in the literature , as was demonstrated by recent simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , it appears to be within the reach of metropolis simulations to lead the way towards determining reliable parameterizations .",
    "* the rm@xmath50 approximation to the rugged metropolis ( rm ) method  @xcite leads already to considerable improvements over conventional metropolis simulations of met - enkephalin at 300@xmath54k . as rm@xmath50 is easily implemented and needs no additional computer time , it should be used whenever metropolis simulations of suitable systems are done . * for larger systems one - variable moves alone will not work due to correlations between the dihedral angles .",
    "the rm approach promises sufficiently large acceptance rates for multi - variable moves . *",
    "ultimately , each biomolecule of interest may need its own , specifically designed , metropolis algorithm .",
    "this task includes to determine reliable parameters for a solvent model like the one of eq.([e_sol ] ) .",
