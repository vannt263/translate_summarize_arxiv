    "quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information , ensuring security of key distribution and efficiency of quantum computing .",
    "most of the quantum information protocols work best with maximally and pure entangled states , but unfortunately entanglement is extremely sensitive to decoherence .",
    "such difficulty imposes an extensive effort in order to recover a fairly good degree of entanglement after its interaction with noise , which is the main cause of the entanglement deterioration . in the last few years various schemes",
    "have been implemented in order to overcome this problem , especially in literature we refer to the _ distillation , purification _ and _ concentration _ schemes @xcite .",
    "all these techniques deal with an entanglement recovery after a non - completely destructive interaction with noise in the communication channel . even if a clear distinction between purification , distillation and concentration has not been precisely defined yet , it is possible to indicate as _ distillation _ a procedure which increases the entanglement of a state .",
    "instead the purification protocol increases the purity of the state , while the concentration protocol increases both the purity and the entanglement of a mixed state @xcite .    in this work we present novel application of the three - photon entanglement concentration procedure in an entanglement - breaking process caused by a strong coupling with a noisy photon @xcite .",
    "this refers to a realistic situation , in which one photon from an entangled pair interacts trough a _ coherent cross - talk _ with a completely depolarized photon .",
    "such photon acts as the environment which interacts with the signal trough a real noisy channel .",
    "the main novelty of such procedure is that the entanglement lost in the interaction is somewhat re - directed onto the signal photon pair by a measurement on the environmental photon @xcite .",
    "usually , in most of the literature the environment , isolated with the system from the rest of the world , is considered as a pure state , which of course is easier to be completely controlled and characterized .",
    "we theoretically show that our protocol works even when the environment is in a mixed state . in this case",
    "the environment can been considered as a subsystem of a composite entangled state , giving rise to a wide variety of implementation in quantum information .",
    "the experimental implementation of each single step of the concentration protocol has been carried out with the environmental photon in a fully mixed state which interacts with a maximally entangled state through a linear coupling .",
    "as further development of the entanglement concentration , we have carried an in - depth study on the interaction between noise and quantum information , generalizing the entanglement concentration process up to n coherent interactions between signal and noise .",
    "as shown in @xcite , two different scenarios can be analyzed : whether the environmental photon and the signal one on the input mode of the bs are perfectly distinguishable or partially indistinguishable .",
    "here we focus our attention only on almost _",
    "indistinguishable _ case , therefore we keep the traditional name of concentration .",
    "if the signal and the environmental photons are perfectly indistinguishable , the protocol exploits quantum interference phenomena , analogously to the quantum state teleportation , and asymptotically retrieves all the initial entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "even when the signal photon is in principle distinguishable from the environment but , due to technological limitations , can not be discriminated , it has been experimentally demonstrated that our protocol allows a partial recover of the initial entanglement .",
    "the overall dynamic of the protocol can be divided in three different steps : + * i ) coupling with environment . * alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) share a polarization entangled state @xmath0 , and the photon @xmath1 propagates over a noisy channel .",
    "the environment @xmath2 is represented by a completely unpolarized photon described by the density matrix @xmath3 that interacts with @xmath1 by a localizable linear coupling : a generic beam splitter bs with transmittivity @xmath4 and reflectivity @xmath5 .",
    "the present channel acts as a depolarizing channel , which means a balanced stochastic combination of the pauli s operators @xmath6 .",
    "+ we point out that all the results that will be presented can be directly extended for general passive coupling between two modes @xcite . after the interaction on the beam splitter",
    ", three possible situations can be observed : both the photons go to environment or to the signal mode , or only a single photon is separately presented in signal and environment .",
    "the first case corresponds simply to attenuation , while the second case can be in principle distinguished by counting the number of photons in the signal .",
    "thus only the last case is interesting to be analyzed .",
    "after the interaction process , the entanglement has been damaged and , below a threshold value of @xmath4 , no entanglement can be observed in the output state . +",
    "* ii)measurement of the environment . * during the interaction on the bs , the initial entanglement between the pair photons is transferred to the three - photon mixed state entanglement between the environmental photon and the signal one .",
    "such transfer is driven by the strength of the coupling , determined by the transmittivity t of the bs .",
    "of course , due to the fact that we face to a mixed state environment , we refer to a correlation originated by the initial entanglement shared in the epr pair , which is stored in the environmental photon after the interaction . hence by properly measuring the environment it is possible to approach such correlation and restoring it into the entangled signal pair .",
    "+ the photon propagating on the environmental mode is measured after a polarization analysis realized through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . +",
    "* iii)filtration . * a interesting role in the protocol",
    "is represented by a filtration performed both on alice and bob modes .",
    "such operation leads to a higher entanglement of the bipartite system , at the cost of a lower probability of implementation .",
    "we indicate the attenuation over the mode @xmath7 for the @xmath8 polarization as @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "the complete protocol implies a classical feed - forward on the polarization state of the photon belonging to the bob s mode depending on which detector on environmental mode fires .",
    "this conditional operation could be realized adopting the electronic scheme experimentally demonstrated in @xcite . in the present experiment",
    "the active procedure has not been applied , hence the efficiency of the overall procedure is reduced by a factor 2 .",
    "+ for each step of the protocol , we reconstruct the two qubit density matrix through the quantum state tomography procedure @xcite .",
    "after the coupling between entangled signal and the environmental photon on the beam - splitter , the whole state is described by the three - qubit density matrix shown in fig.(2-a ) .",
    "as underlined previously , and in - depth analysis of such matrix allows to achieve a better knowledge on the quantum correlation dynamics , shown in fig.(2-b ) . the parameter @xmath4 establish the degree of correlation damaging between the photon a and the b one that is , how the noise corrupts the signal . a high value of transmittivity @xmath4 simulates the case of a weakly noisy channel , which does not destroy completely the initial information ( red line in fig.(2-b ) ) .",
    "usually this is the regime in which all the already implemented protocols work .",
    "lower the value of transmittivity @xmath4 , greater is the correlation established between the environment and the photon a , at cost of a concurrence reduction in the initial entangled state described by @xmath11 .",
    "when a balanced beam splitter is used for the coupling process , the concurrence referred to the density matrix of the environmental photon and the bob s one achieves its maximum value , since it is related to the generation of a maximal entangled state shared between b and e. as a consequence the initial entanglement between alice and bob is completely lost and transferred to bob and to the environmental photon .",
    "this transferred entanglement is exploited in the concentration scheme .",
    "the entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath2 generated by the coupling is continuously converted to entanglement between @xmath12 and @xmath2 . for the strong coupling @xmath13",
    ", the @xmath14 entanglement is redirected back to @xmath15 entanglement .",
    "however for @xmath16 there is no entanglement between @xmath15 and @xmath14 , and the non - local correlation survives only locally between @xmath17 . such entanglement is crucial for the concentration procedure , since together with classical correlations helps to restore @xmath15 entanglement .     representing the three - qubit state after the coupling process on @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "* ( b)*- plot of the concurrence c for different values of the transmittivity t of the bs .",
    "each concurrence refers to the correlation established between two subsystems.,width=340 ]",
    "in order to exploit the regime where the concentration protocol works best , we consider the signal photon and the noise one spatially , spectrally and temporal perfectly indistinguishable in the coupling process .",
    "a good spatial overlap is achieved by selecting the output modes through single mode fibers .",
    "the entangled state @xmath20 , that is the signal to be transmitted through the noisy channel , has been generated by a nl crystal of @xmath21-barium borate ( bbo ) cut for type - ii phase - matching . + * i)mixing . * in the indistinguishable photons regime , we indicate with @xmath22 the density matrix after the mixing on the @xmath18 , which is separable for @xmath23 , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the output state is found to be a werner state , which is a mixture of the singlet state and the fully mixed one @xcite . without tracing over the environmental mode",

    "when the result @xmath25 is obtained , @xmath22 evolves into @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability of implementation success of the process .",
    "the werner state is hence conditionally transformed into a maximally entangled state ( mems ) @xcite : see fig.4 .",
    "in particular , it is found @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "+ let us now compare the theoretical predictions to experimental results .",
    "the experimental generation of perfectely indistinguishable photons has to face some unavoidable technological limitations . in order to account this situation , for the experimental data analysis we have considered the state shared between alice and bob as a mixture between perfectely indistinguishable photons , weighted by the degree of indistinguishability @xmath31 , and distinguishable photons .",
    "such state leads to a reduction on the correlation restored by our protocol , due to a lower interference between signal and environment .",
    "+ in order to estimate the parameter @xmath31 , we have carried out an hong - ou - mandel interferometer experiment @xcite adopting a bs with @xmath32 , which has yielded to @xmath33 . + the experimental results are shown in fig.(5-*ii * ) for @xmath34 .",
    "the entanglement is restored with a concurrence equal to @xmath35 to be compared with @xmath36 ; the fidelity with the theoretical state is @xmath37 + * iii)filtration * due to the strong unbalancement of @xmath26 a filter is introduced either on alice or bob mode , depending on the value of @xmath4 : fig.3 . if @xmath38 , the filter acts on bob mode , as @xmath39 , while if @xmath40 , the filter acts on alice mode , as @xmath41 .",
    "+ in order to properly apply the filtration , it is necessary to estimate the value of @xmath4 .",
    "hence the filtration procedure can be successfully applied after a characterization of the communication channel . over a time period",
    "during which the transmission channel is a stationary one , is possible to quantify the `` transmittivity '' ( amount of noise introduced ) , comparing the signal at the input and output of the channel .    .",

    "the concurrence has value @xmath49 while the probability reads @xmath50 . in fig.3",
    "are reported the concurrence values for @xmath51 and @xmath24 .",
    "hence in the limit of asymptotic filtration ( @xmath52 ) , the concurrence reaches unity except for @xmath53 . since maximally entangled state",

    "we consider all couplings to be linear , that is an interaction on a beam splitter ( see fig.6 ) .",

    "furthermore , we consider @xmath64 for @xmath65 . while it can be deduced that the concentration protocol can ideally work properly if all the three steps are applied for each interaction , our calculation refers to the case in which the filtration procedure is applied only after all the @xmath66 interactions between signal and noise . as a first step , we study the case of a double interaction between noise and signal and",

    "* ii)measurement .",
    "* after two steps of interaction , the second environmental mode is projected on @xmath82 state , hence the matrix @xmath83 evolves to @xmath84 .",

    "but in all the other cases , the entanglement was restored by the concentration measurement . in the generalized case , where the signal interacts n - times with an environmental completely mixed photon , the matrix form allows a widespread expression of the density matrix which describes the quantum state after the n - th interaction .",
    "in particular , after the projection on @xmath94 state on each environmental mode , it is possible to demonstrate that the state on the output mode of the @xmath95 beam splitter is described by the matrix : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the probability of success for the implementation of the @xmath95 measure .",
