    "the effects of disorder ( randomness ) on the critical behavior represent an important aspect of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) .",
    "disorder brings with it a plethora of profound phenomena beyond those present in clean systems  @xcite , with many open questions of broad interest in quantum many - body physics .",
    "many different kinds of disorders can be considered , e.g. , random dilution of the degrees of freedom or random variations in the coupling constants . among the possible disorder channels in quantum spin systems",
    ", random dilution has attracted special attention because of the possibilities to achieve it experimentally by substitution of magnetic ions by non - magnetic ones , e.g. , replacing cu bu zn or mg in the high - t@xmath13 cuprates @xcite .",
    "the case is also of particular interest from a theoretical point of view as there is simple notion of classical `` geometrical '' fluctuations which interplay with the quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "thus , a multicritical point can appear if those two fluctuations diverge together , as a classical percolation point is approached while at the same time tuning the quantum fluctuations .",
    "a prototypical example is the relatively well understood transverse - field ising model with dimensionality @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "many works have also shown that a multicritical point can be realized in the diluted bilayer heisenberg model with different intralayer interaction @xmath1 and interlayer interaction @xmath2 , if the dilution is accomplished by random removal of entire dimers ( instead of diluting individual spins , which leaves behind `` dangling '' spins which lead to different physics )  @xcite .",

    "[ model ] and is further studied in this paper .",
    "( blue bonds ) and interplane coupling @xmath2 ( red vertical bonds ) .",
    "the open circles stand for removed dimers ( i.e. , the two spins are removed , not just the coupling between them ) . by tuning the coupling ratio @xmath4 a qpt can be reached for any dilution fraction @xmath15 , with @xmath16 @xcite being the classical percolation point . ]",

    "while this criticality has been studied previously @xcite , we here re - examine it in light of recent studies @xcite of other , similar quantum phase transitions where no changes in the critical exponents were found in the presence of disorder  in violation of the harris criterion @xcite for the relevance of disorder .",
    "in addition , we study `` quantum glass '' ( griffiths ) behavior away from the critical curve .",
    "such phases come in two main variants in random quantum spin systems and boson systems : the bose glass ( bg ) and mott glass ( mg ) @xcite .",
    "both of them are gapless , with the bg having a non - zero uniform susceptibility @xmath20 ( compressibility in boson language , where the magnetization of a spin system is mapped onto the density of the boson system ) at @xmath19 while the mg has a vanishing @xmath20 at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the mg can only exist in random systems with particle - hole symmetry @xcite , though recently evidence has been found of similar behavior also without this symmetry ( an mg or and effective mg with extremely small essentially undetectable @xmath19 compressibility ) @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", the mg phase was investigated in a two - dimensional square - lattice dimerized heisenberg model with three different nearest - neighbor couplings @xcite and the suscetibility was found to follow a stretched exponential form .",

    "the critical exponents are the same as the classical @xmath29 heisenberg model , i.e. , the 3d o(3 ) universality class .",
    "when @xmath30 , the model turns into two separate diluted @xmath31 square lattice heisenberg and at the classical percolation point @xmath32 the percolating cluster remains ordered at @xmath19 .",
    "this order persists in the coupled layers as well up to @xmath33 , which is a multi - critical point with simultaneous critical geometrical ( percolation ) fluctuations and critical quantum fluctuations of the spins on those classically critical clusters .",

    "note that a cross - over away from the linear behavior can be seen for @xmath65 but for @xmath66 we do not observe any cross - overs at the temperatures studied .",
    "at @xmath3 it has been speculated that the scaling may hold all the way down to @xmath19 because the percolating cluster has vanishing stiffness ( which sets the scale of the cross - over ) @xcite , but for @xmath15 there must eventually be a cross - over because the stiffness is non - zero .    we have also studied the critical behavior at @xmath67 and find the critical point @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "considering the error bars , the @xmath61-value is not very different from the value obtained at @xmath41 , and the most likely scenario is that @xmath61 is the same but different from @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , which would agree with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the critical exponents were found not not change with @xmath6 in the classical model . in that study , a scaling correction was used because the fitting curve deviates significantly from the pure power - law behavior .",
    "however , in our case the power - law fitting curves are of high quality with @xmath72 for @xmath73 in fig .  [ critical ] .",
    "the dynamic exponent is also quite different from the random - coupling square lattice heisenberg model , where @xmath74 always appears to hold @xcite .",
    "this implies that the two kinds of disordered systems have quite different low - energy physics systems , which would not be expected at first sight and for which there is no theoretical explanation as of yet .",
    "the harris criterion can normally be used to determine the relevance of disorder at classical phase transitions .",
    "it says that the correlation length exponent @xmath75 in the clean system has to fulfill @xmath76 if disorder is irrelevant .",
    "otherwise , the critical exponents will change when disorder is introduced in order to satisfy the inequality @xcite .",
    "although it has been thought to be applicable to qpts , several disordered systems have shown violations of the harris criterion .",
    "@xcite the dimensionality @xmath53 for a qpt in harris criterion is the number of dimensions which have disorder .",
