    "the description of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprate compounds has been a central problem at the frontier of quantum many body theory in the last decade .",
    "although many anomalous properties have been observed in the normal state , both in the over - doped and under - doped regions , no theoretical consensus has emerged on their origin .",
    "part of the difficulty is that there appear to be many competing instabilities and excitations as one cools down from high temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , and they are all strongly coupled to each other at intermediate @xmath6 .",
    "however , simplifications do occur at temperatures @xmath7 , the critical temperature below which there is an onset of @xmath0-wave superconductivity . in this review",
    "we shall argue , on the basis of recent experimental observations , that there is an important decoupling between different sectors of the excitation spectrum which carry a non - zero spin , and that this decoupling allows development of tractable quantum field theories of the low energy excitations @xcite .",
    "we will make quantitative predictions for the impurity - induced and intrinsic damping of these excitations and compare them to experimental results .",
    "let us list the elementary excitations of the @xmath0-wave superconductor and nearby phases :    [ [ a ] ] ( a ) + + + +    the superconductivity is of course a consequence of the condensation of spin @xmath8 , charge @xmath9 cooper pairs .",
    "below @xmath10 , the excitations of the phase of the condensate are responsible for the superflow , and for the plasmon excitations . in this paper , we will be primarily concerned with the damping of excitations which carry spin , and these couple only weakly to the phase excitations in a well - formed superconductor at low @xmath6 : so we will neglect the phase excitations in the body of the paper .",
    "these phase excitations become more important near a @xmath11 superconducting - insulator transition , but we will not consider such a situation here . above @xmath10 , phase fluctuations @xcite",
    "are surely important for the transport properties , and they also couple strongly to some of the fermionic quasiparticle excitations : we will briefly discuss this phenomenon further below .",
    "[ [ b ] ] ( b ) + + + +    these are the familiar bogoliubov quasiparticles in a bcs theory of the superconducting state . because of the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter , their energies vanishes at four nodal points in the brillouin zone - @xmath12 , with @xmath13 for optimally doped @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". we will denote the fermionic excitations in the vicinity of these points by the nambu spinors @xmath15 ( see fig  [ fig1 ] and further details in section  [ damp ] ) .",
    "= 5.1 in    it is also interesting to consider the fermionic excitations near the @xmath16 and @xmath17 points : here the pairing amplitude has its largest value and so there is a large energy gap , @xmath18 , towards exciting the quasiparticles .",
    "we will denote these high energy quasiparticles generically by @xmath19 ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) . because of their large pairing amplitude , the @xmath19 quasiparticles couple efficiently to the phase fluctuations discussed above in ( a ) , and are expected to have a rapidly decreasing lifetime once the phase fluctuations proliferate above @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the nodal quasiparticles , @xmath15 , are in a region of vanishing pairing , and are essentially decoupled from the phase fluctuations : as we will discuss below , other mechanisms will be required to damp the @xmath15 quasiparticles .",
    "[ [ c ] ] ( c ) + + + +    neutron scattering experiments observe a sharp resonance peak at an energy @xmath20 in the scattering cross section at the antiferromagnetic wavevector , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we will view this bosonic @xmath2 resonant collective mode , @xmath3 ( @xmath22 are the spin components ) , as that expected in a paramagnetic phase across a magnetic disordering quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "( for the case where @xmath23 , the @xmath3 are real , while for incommensurate @xmath21 , the @xmath3 become complex ; we will explicitly treat the commensurate case here , although the generalization to the incommensurate case is straightforward @xcite , and does not modify any of the scaling arguments , including the central result ( [ gamma ] ) . )",
    "our identification of @xmath3 is similar to the view that it is a @xmath2 particle - hole bound state in a @xmath0-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in more detail below , appealing to the proximity of a quantum phase transition allows a systematic treatment of the strongly relevant self - interactions of the @xmath3 field .",
    "such a collective mode has also been discussed in models with a special so(5 ) symmetry @xcite , but we shall not appeal to symmetries beyond the usual su(2 ) spin symmetry in our treatment . the coupling of the @xmath3 to the fermionic quasiparticles in ( b ) is illustrated in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "momentum conservation allows a strong coupling between the @xmath19 and the @xmath3 in the vicinity of the so - called `` hot spots '' @xcite .",
    "this coupling leads to strong mutual damping of @xmath19 and @xmath3 above @xmath10 .",
    "below @xmath10 , the same coupling is surely an important ingredient in the pairing of the @xmath19 fermions @xcite : this conclusion is supported by the `` shake - off '' satellite peaks , separated by the @xmath24 40 mev , observed in the photoemission and optical spectra @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient in our discussion is also clear from fig  [ fig1 ] : the coupling between the low energy @xmath15 fermions and the @xmath3 mode is strongly suppressed by momentum conservation  moving a distance @xmath21 from a nodal point places one in a section of the brillouin zone ( _ e.g. _ near the point @xmath25 in fig  [ fig1 ] ) where the fermionic excitations cost over 100 mev .",
    "remnants of the shake - off peaks just noted are also seen along the @xmath26 directions@xcite not too far from the point @xmath25 , but this does not qualitatively modify the low energy @xmath15 excitations within the shaded circles .",
    "we have now collected all the ingredients necessary to motivate our recent computations .    in section  [ qimp ]",
    "we will discuss the @xmath11 broadening of the @xmath3 collective mode by the substitution of a small concentration of non - magnetic impurities like zn or li on the cu sites , and compare our theoretical results @xcite to experimental observations @xcite .",
    "it should be clear from the discussion above that , in the absence of such extrinsic broadening , it is possible for the @xmath3 resonance to be infinitely sharp at @xmath11 in a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the @xmath3 quanta couple strongly to the @xmath19 fermions , but these induce no damping as long as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 mev near optimal doping @xcite ) . along the diagonals of the brillouin zone , momentum conservation prohibits coupling to the gapless nodal fermions @xmath15 , and only allows couplings to quasiparticle excitations whose excitation energy exceeds @xmath20",
    ".    section  [ damp ] will consider _ intrinsic _ @xmath6-dependent damping of the nodal fermionic quasiparticles by inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed the damping of the gapped @xmath19 above . below @xmath10",
    ", photoemission experiments @xcite observe negligible damping of the @xmath19 fermions , and this is consistent with our considerations : the phase fluctuations in ( a ) are suppressed , while the @xmath3 mode in ( c ) leads to coherent pairing of @xmath19 fermions . above @xmath10 , phase fluctuations proliferate , and their strong coupling to the @xmath19 is expected to lead to significant inelastic scattering of the @xmath19 @xcite ; additional scattering is also expected from the `` hot - spot '' coupling to the @xmath3 , and these expectations are consistent with experimental observations .",
    "however neither of the fluctuations in ( a ) or ( c ) couple to the nodal fermions @xmath15 : so , with our present considerations we would conclude that the nodal fermions should be very sharp both below and above @xmath10 .",
    "the actual experimental situation is dramatically different @xcite ",
    "these nodal quasiparticles have a large inverse lifetime , which decreases roughly linearly with @xmath6 , and an imaginary component of a self energy which is roughly linearly proportional to frequency , @xmath29 , for @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , these damping rates change smoothly through @xmath10 , with little sign of the superconducting transition .",
    "we have to appeal to other inelastic damping mechanisms to explain these observations , and we will present a critical classification of candidates in section  [ damp ] .",
    "before discussing the effect of impurities , we state our model for the spin collective mode , @xmath3 , in the clean @xmath0-wave superconductor . a popular approach in recent work",
    "@xcite has been to compute the dynamic spin susceptibility of the underlying electrons and to identify this mode as a bound state pole near the antiferromagnetic wavevector : this is schematically indicated in fig  [ fig2]a .",
    "however all such studies have so far neglected three- and four - point ( and higher multi - point ) self interactions of the spin excitations , which are schematically indicated in figs  [ fig2]b and  [ fig2]c respectively .",
    "one of the key points of our work is that it is essential to include the interactions in figs  [ fig2]b and  [ fig2]c in the low energy theory : these are strongly relevant perturbations , and in a sense , their effective strength is infinite ( higher multi - point interactions can , however , be neglected ) . the simple results for impurity - induced damping we shall quote below rely on hyperscaling properties , and these are a direct consequence of the self interactions in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "so how does one obtain a tractable theory which includes the interactions in fig  [ fig2 ] ?",
    "our strategy is to appeal to the proximity of a @xmath11 magnetic ordering transition at which the excitation energy of @xmath3 , @xmath20 , vanishes .",
    "this is a quantum phase transition driven by the condensation of @xmath3 to a state with coexisting superconductivity and collinear spin density wave order .",
    "we will develop a theory for the quantum - critical point of this transition , and then use powerful field - theoretic methods to expand back into the region where @xmath20 is non - zero .",
    "the values of the interactions in fig  [ fig2 ] will be universally determined by the underlying structure of the expansion in relevant perturbations of the critical field theory .",
    "such an approach effectively reduces to an expansion in @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a microscopic exchange constant , and the smallness of this ratio is our primary assumption .",
    "we shall use a theoretical model ( which is supported by the ` pseudo - gap ' phenomenology ) in which the magnetic ordering transition occurs while the excitation energy of the @xmath19 remains non - zero , and so these fermions can be neglected in the critical theory of the transition .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath15 fermions have little coupling to the magnetic excitations , and so an action for the transition can be expressed in terms of the @xmath3 alone . by analogy with theories developed for the magnetic transition in insulators , and using general symmetry arguments @xcite , we can write down the following effective action for the bulk @xmath3 fluctuations in the @xmath0-wave superconductor : @xmath33 ; \\label{sb}\\ ] ] the fermionic excitations with spin , @xmath15 , @xmath19 have been integrated out , and for reasons already discussed ,",
    "serve only to renormalize the values of the couplings in ( [ sb ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the velocity of spin - waves in the ordered phase , and @xmath35 tunes the system between the two phases which lie on either side of a critical value @xmath36 .",
    "the quartic non - linearity , @xmath37 , corresponds to the interaction in fig  [ fig2]c .",
    "how about the cubic coupling in fig  [ fig2]b ? this is implicitly accounted for in ( [ sb ] ) in a manner we now describe . by momentum conservation ,",
    "if two of the particle - hole propagators in fig  [ fig2]b carry momentum @xmath21 , the third must carry momentum @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it represents the ferromagnetic spin component @xmath39 .",
    "this has allowed three - point couplings with the @xmath3 , including the kinematic term @xcite in the action @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath39 fluctuations are not critical , and after integrating them out , one obtains renormalizations of terms already present in ( [ sb ] ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of the bulk quantum phase transition described by of @xmath41 have been worked out in some detail @xcite , and many aspects are in agreement with trends in nmr and neutron scattering experiments on the high temperature superconductors @xcite . here , we will only need a few well - known scaling properties of the critical point of ( [ sb ] ) . upon interpreting @xmath42 as a third spatial dimension",
    ", @xmath41 can also represent the partition function of a classical heisenberg ferromagnet in dimension @xmath43 at finite temperature , and its curie transition corresponds to the quantum - critical point we are interested in .",
    "both occur at a critical value @xmath44 , where there the functional integral over @xmath3 is invariant under the scale transformation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a rescaling factor , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are known critical exponents of the @xmath43 classical heisenberg model . the last transformation in ( [ scaleh ] )",
    "represents the mapping of the composite operator @xmath49 , and its scaling dimension is not simply twice that of @xmath3 because of corrections due to the @xmath37 interaction in ( [ sb ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the effect of a dilute concentration of impurities .",
    "we will outline the central ingredients leading to our main result , and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "consider a single impurity at @xmath50 ; by `` impurity '' we mean an _ arbitrary _ localized deformation in the vicinity of @xmath50 .",
    "one consequence of any such deformation will be a change in the value of @xmath35 near @xmath50 , and this will lead to the following term in the action @xmath51 under the scale transformation ( [ scaleh ] ) , we see immediately that @xmath52 has scaling dimension @xmath53 , and is therefore _ irrelevant _ at the critical point of ( [ sb ] ) , and it has only weak effects on the bulk properties . to obtain a local , relevant , perturbation on the bulk fluctuations ,",
    "we need to consider quantum mechanical effects associated with berry phases .",
    "the berry phases accumulated by the precession of spins in the host antiferromagnet cancel almost completely upon an average over the lattice sites @xcite ; however , in the presence of impurities it is entirely possible that this cancellation is disrupted , and a residual berry phase of spin @xmath54 ( @xmath54 must be an integer or half - odd - integer ) survives @xcite . to account for this berry phase",
    "we introduce a single unit vector @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) representing the orientation of the net uncompensated spin , and the action @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a function of @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 .",
    "this berry phase is intimately connected to the fact that an external magnetic field will lead to a curie susceptibility @xmath61 from the impurity spin in the non - magnetic phase ( in the absence of kondo screening ",
    "see below ) ; this response is divergent as @xmath62 and is a reflection of a @xmath63-fold degenerate level near the impurity . for the case of a non - magnetic zn or li ion replacing a magnetic @xmath1 cu ion in the high temperature superconductors ,",
    "the above arguments on berry phases strongly suggest that each such impurity should contribute a term like ( [ simp ] ) with @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by nmr experiments @xcite , and we will assume its validity in our discussion below .",
    "other authors have modeled the zn ion solely as a non - magnetic scatterer in the unitarity limit @xcite .",
    "in such a model , the fermionic quasiparticles form quasi - bound states at the impurity sites at the fermi level ; we believe that after accounting for the strong local coulomb repulsion at the impurity site , each bound state will capture only a single electron , and the low energy physics will then be described by ( [ simp ] ) with @xmath1 ( see also ref  @xcite ) .",
    "we now need to couple the impurity degree of freedom , @xmath59 , to those of the host .",
    "the most important coupling is the simple linear term @xmath64 to compute the scaling dimension of @xmath65 at the fixed point where the impurity and bulk degrees of freedom are decoupled , we note that if @xmath66 under the transformation ( [ scaleh ] ) , the impurity action ( [ simp ] ) remains invariant .",
    "under such a mapping , @xmath65 has dimension @xmath67 . unlike @xmath52 ,",
    "the coupling @xmath65 is therefore _ relevant _ at the @xmath68 fixed point , and plays a central role in the main results presented below .",
    "we can also imagine a kondo coupling , @xmath69 between the spin , @xmath55 , and the host fermions @xmath15 , @xmath19 .",
    "however , the fermionic , single particle density of states vanishes at the fermi level , and this dramatically reduces the possibility of kondo screening of the impurity spin : with particle - hole symmetry , there is no kondo screening even upto @xmath70 , while without particle - hole symmetry , the spin is screened only above an appreciable threshold value of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we will assume that no kondo screening has occurred over the experimentally relevant temperature range .",
    "the above arguments suggest that a theory of the impurity spin dynamics will emerge from a complete renormalization group analysis of @xmath71 .",
    "this has been carried out in ref  @xcite , and the final results are quite simple : the bulk phase transition at @xmath36 is the only critical point , and @xmath72 remains the only relevant perturbation at this critical point ; both @xmath73 and @xmath65 approach fixed point values @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( related phenomena were noted earlier in simpler models @xcite ) .",
    "there is no separate critical point associated with the impurity degrees of freedom , as is often the case in the theory critical phenomena on boundaries @xcite .",
    "a remarkable consequence of this is that the single energy scale , @xmath20 , which characterized the dynamics of the paramagnet in the host system @xcite , is also all that is needed to completely characterize the dynamics in the vicinity of the impurity .",
    "of course , the quantized number @xmath54 in ( [ simp ] ) also influences the values of the various universal scaling functions .",
    "now consider a dilute concentration of impurities , @xmath76 , each described by the analog of ( [ simp ] ) and ( [ sc ] ) , placed at random locations in the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we will answer the following key question , relevant to the neutron scattering experiments on zn doped @xmath77 by fong _",
    "at what energy scale , @xmath78 , does the @xmath2 resonant pole at energy @xmath20 get broadened by the impurities ?",
    "the implication of the renormalization group arguments above is that , for small @xmath31 , @xmath78 is universally determined by the only dimensionful parameters available to us : @xmath76 , @xmath20 , and the velocity @xmath34 .",
    "making the mild assumption that , for small @xmath79 , @xmath78 must be linearly proportional to @xmath76 ( this is supported by explicit computations @xcite ) , simple dimensional analysis of the length and time scales allows us to conclude @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a universal number .",
    "all corrections to ( [ gamma ] ) will be suppressed by positive powers of @xmath82 .",
    "notice also the inverse dependence on the small energy scale @xmath20 : this is an indication of the strong effect of the relevant coupling in ( [ sc ] ) . for an impurity with @xmath8 , the simplest allowed coupling is @xmath52 , and its irrelevance implies @xmath83 , and the corrections just noted will be the leading contributions .",
    "we have estimated @xmath84 in a self - consistent non - crossing approximation and obtained @xmath85 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite our main result ( [ gamma ] ) in a different manner : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a correlation length .",
    "so if we imagine a `` swiss cheese '' model @xcite where each impurity makes a hole of radius @xmath88 , the inverse @xmath89 of the resonance is of order the fractional volume of holes in the swiss cheese .",
    "the numerical predictions of ( [ gamma ] ) are in good agreement with the observations of fong _ et al .",
    "we use @xmath90 , @xmath91 mev , and the spin - wave velocity in the insulator @xmath92 ev , and obtain @xmath93 mev .",
    "this compares well with the observed value of @xmath94 mev .",
    "we have also predicted detailed lineshapes for the impurity - induced broadening , and these will hopefully be tested in future , higher precision experiments .",
    "as we noted at the end of section  [ sec : intro ] , recent experimental observations @xcite of a short lifetime @xmath95 , and a large frequency - dependent self energy , for the nodal quasiparticles both above and below @xmath10 , are puzzling in the light of the very weak coupling between the @xmath15 and both the @xmath3 and phase fluctuations .",
    "consequently , we have to appeal to a separate decoupled sector of low energy fluctuations to explain this anomalous damping @xcite .",
    "a natural way of obtaining inverse lifetimes of order @xmath96 , and self energies of order @xmath29 , is to assume that the system is in the quantum - critical region of a @xmath11 quantum phase transition for which the @xmath15 fermions are central critical degrees of freedom @xcite ( see fig  [ fig3 ] ) ; the quantum - critical point should be described by an interacting quantum field theory below its upper critical dimension , so that universal low - energy fluctuations dominate the interactions .",
    "a further constraint is that the critical fluctuations should be decoupled from the @xmath19 fermions , as these remain undamped below @xmath10 : so the new low energy mode associated with the onset of state @xmath97 in fig  [ fig3 ] couples strongly to the @xmath15 but not the @xmath19 .",
    "it will turn out that these constraints are rather difficult to satisfy , and lead to an essentially unique identification of the state @xmath97 in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "clearly , the magnetic transition in section  [ qimp ] can not be the required transition because the @xmath15 fermions are innocuous spectators of its critical field theory .",
    "we will list below many of the order parameters that have been considered in the literature in the last decade , and discuss whether they satisfy the requirements we have imposed on the state @xmath97 .    before we embark on this ,",
    "let us recall the effective action for the nodal quasiparticles in the @xmath0-wave superconductor well away from the quantum - critical point , @xmath98 .",
    "we denote the components of the electron annihilation operator , @xmath99 , in the vicinity of the four nodal points @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 by @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 respectively , where @xmath108 is the electron spin component .",
    "the 4-component nambu spinors are @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an antisymmetric tensor with @xmath112 .",
    "the action is then @xmath113 here @xmath114 are pauli matrices which act in the fermionic particle - hole space , @xmath115 measure the wavevector from the nodal points and have been rotated by 45 degrees from the axes of the square lattice , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 are velocities .",
    "the action @xmath118 has a scale invariance which will be useful in our considerations below @xmath119 where @xmath46 is a rescaling factor .",
    "we can illustrate the power of scaling arguments by showing how this transformation allows us to quickly deduce damping produced by ordinary screened coulomb interactions ( the screening is performed by the cooper pairs in the condensate ) .",
    "these interactions lead to couplings like @xmath120 and it is easy to see that under ( [ scale ] ) , @xmath121 has scaling dimension -1",
    ". therefore @xmath121 is _ irrelevant _ , and perturbation theory in @xmath121 should be reliable .",
    "the fermion self energy , @xmath122 , acquires an imaginary part at order @xmath123 ; using the fact that under ( [ scale ] ) the frequency and momentum dependent self energy transforms as @xmath124 , the result ( [ coul ] ) immediately leads to @xmath125 ( and similarly for the @xmath29 dependence ) .",
    "this damping rate appears far too weak to explain the experimental observations .",
    "we now turn to considerations of quantum critical points , and list various plausible candidates for the state @xmath97 in fig  [ fig3 ] . we will only consider order parameters for @xmath97 which break simple underlying symmetries of the hamiltonian : the symmetry of the square lattice space group , time - reversal , and spin rotation ( the last we have already discussed above ) . more complicated transitions with non - local order parameters and deconfinement transitions are also possible , but we will not consider them here @xcite .",
    "many investigators @xcite have considered the possibility of @xmath0-wave superconductivity coexisting with a staggered distribution of orbital currents ( or an `` orbital antiferromagnet '' ) .",
    "this state @xmath97 is characterized by the expectation value @xcite @xmath126 where , as before , @xmath23 , and @xmath127 is a real order parameter . momentarily neglecting the fermionic excitations ,",
    "we can , just as for ( [ sb ] ) , write down an effective action for @xmath127 fluctuations purely on symmetry grounds : @xmath128 ; \\label{si}\\ ] ] ( without strict particle - hole symmetry , a first order time derivative term is potentially allowed , but the only possible relevant term , @xmath129 , is a total derivative @xmath130 ) .",
    "as is well known , @xmath131 describes the phase transition in the ising model in @xmath43 spacetime dimensions . at the critical point @xmath44 , @xmath41 is also invariant under the extension of ( [ scale ] ) to the analog of the scale transformations in ( [ scaleh ] ) @xmath132 where now @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the exponents of the @xmath43 ising model . to decide if this purely ising description of the transition is correct , we have to test its stability to a coupling between the @xmath127 and the @xmath15 . from ( [ oaf1 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath127 carries momentum @xmath21 , and so the momentum conservation constraints upon its coupling to the fermions are identical to those of the spin mode @xmath3 in fig  [ fig1 ] : unless @xmath135 , there is no linear coupling to the fermionic excitations which is linear in @xmath127 . for general @xmath136 ,",
    "the simplest allowed coupling is @xmath137 and similarly for @xmath138 . using ( [ scale ] ) , ( [ scalei ] )",
    ", we deduce that the scaling dimensions of @xmath139 is @xmath140 : consequently @xmath139 is _ irrelevant _ , and the critical theory for the transition is ( [ si ] ) alone .",
    "the fermions @xmath15 are not part of the critical theory , and their inverse lifetimes can be estimated by perturbation theory in @xmath139 . using the scaling dimension of @xmath139 above",
    ", we deduce that the fermionic self energy has the following @xmath6 dependence in the quantum - critical region of fig  [ fig3 ] : @xmath141 ( and @xmath142 for @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is a super - linear power , which does not appear compatible with experimental observations .",
    "finally , we note that the special case @xmath135 has also been considered in ref  @xcite : then a coupling term linear in @xmath127 is also allowed @xcite , but its contribution to @xmath122 vanishes with an even higher power of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the onset of a charge density wave in a @xmath0-wave superconductor , a transition to a state @xmath97 defined by the order parameters @xmath143 where @xmath144 , @xmath145 are the ordering wavevectors , and @xmath146 are complex order parameters .",
    "again , constraints from momentum conservation are rather severe . unless @xmath147",
    ", there is no coupling between the @xmath146 and the @xmath15 fermions . existing experimental observations of charge stripe formation",
    "easily satisfy @xmath148 . under these conditions ,",
    "the damping of the @xmath15 from the critical charge fluctuations can be estimated as in the staggered - flux case above : the simplest allowed couplings , as in ( [ defw ] ) , are @xmath149 etc . , and we obtain @xmath150 .",
    "any reasonable model of the critical theory of the @xmath146 @xcite has @xmath151 , and so the fermion damping is rather weak .",
    "the special case @xmath147 has also been analyzed in refs  @xcite : it does yield fermion damping compatible with experimental observations @xcite , but , as we have already noted , this mode - locking of the charge stripe and fermionic nodal wavevectors is not supported by experiments .",
    "next consider a time - reversal symmetry breaking transition in which the cooper pair wavefunction in state @xmath97 acquires a small @xmath35-wave component , but with a relative phase factor @xmath152 @xcite : @xmath153 the order parameter is again a single real field @xmath127 . on general symmetry grounds , we expect the effective action of the @xmath127 fluctuations to also have the form ( [ si ] ) .",
    "however , now there is an efficient coupling of @xmath127 fluctuations to the nodal fermions , which is not preempted by momentum conservation .",
    "it is evident from ( [ dsid2 ] ) that @xmath127 fluctuations andreev scatter fermions with momenta @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "this scattering can occur between the nodal points @xmath100 and @xmath102 of the @xmath156 fermions , and similarly for @xmath138 ; it is represented by the allowed coupling : @xmath157 . \\label{dsid4}\\ ] ] now , computing the scaling dimension of the coupling @xmath158 under the transformations ( [ scale ] ) , ( [ scalei ] ) , we observe a crucial difference from the two cases considered so far : the coupling @xmath158 has dimension @xmath159 , and is therefore _ relevant _ , and the @xmath160 fixed point is unstable .",
    "so the critical theory strongly couples the @xmath127 and @xmath15 fluctuations , and a complete understanding requires a more detailed renormalization group analysis of @xmath161 .",
    "this has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and for a similar model in a different physical context in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : we will not discuss this here apart from noting that both the non - linearities , @xmath162 and @xmath158 approach fixed - point values , and there is only one relevant perturbation , ( @xmath163 ) , at the interacting critical point . under these conditions ,",
    "strong scaling applies , and the lifetimes of excitations of the @xmath127 and @xmath15 quanta are of order @xmath164 in the quantum - critical region of fig  [ fig3 ] @xcite .",
    "so for the case in which @xmath97 is a @xmath165 superconductor , the relaxation of the nodal quasiparticles @xmath15 appears to be in good accord with experimental observations .",
    "however , one significant discrepancy remains : the @xmath35-wave order parameter couples strongly to fermions in all directions , and so will also couple to the @xmath19 quasiparticles ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the gapped @xmath19 quasiparticles will easily radiate many of the low - energy @xmath127 quanta , and acquire an appreciable width : this is not in accord with photo - emission experiments in which , as we noted earlier , the @xmath19 quasiparticles become sharp below @xmath10 .      finally , we consider another case in which @xmath97 breaks time - reversal , but now by acquiring a small @xmath166 component @xcite .",
    "we will see that this case is very similar to the @xmath165 case discussed above , but it also succeeds in very simply and naturally resolving the discrepancy with @xmath19 width we have just mentioned .",
    "the order parameter for this transition , replacing ( [ dsid2 ] ) , is @xmath167 the @xmath127 fluctuations again andreev scatter fermions between @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and their coupling to the @xmath15 fields has the form ( replacing ( [ dsid4 ] ) ) : @xmath168 . \\label{dsid5}\\ ] ] notice that the only difference from ( [ dsid4 ] ) is the relative sign of the @xmath156 and @xmath138 terms : this is because the coefficient of @xmath127 in ( [ dsid3 ] ) changes sign between the two pairs of nodal points , unlike the case in ( [ dsid4 ] ) .",
    "the consequences of ( [ dsid5 ] ) are essentially identical to those of ( [ dsid4 ] ) : the coupling @xmath158 approaches a fixed point value , and this leads immediately to a lifetime @xmath169 for the nodal quasiparticles in the quantum - critical region .",
    "moreover , the @xmath19 fermions do _ not _ couple to the @xmath127 fluctuations : the coefficient of @xmath127 in ( [ dsid3 ] ) vanishes along the line between @xmath170 and @xmath4 ( and also between @xmath171 and @xmath4 and other symmetry - related lines ) , and so the fluctuating @xmath166 component of the pair wavefunction does not lead to appreciable broadening of the @xmath19 quasiparticles . therefore ,",
    "if the state @xmath97 is a @xmath172 superconductor , the dynamics of the quantum - critical region are very naturally in accord with the constraints described at the beginning of section  [ damp ] .    quite apart from the motivation provided by the above analysis , there are some appealing independent reasons @xcite for suspecting that the @xmath0-wave superconductor may be on the verge of an instability to a @xmath172 state .",
    "the structure of the incipient fermi surface in fig  [ fig1 ] indicates that there is significant second - neighbor hopping on the square lattice .",
    "accompanying this there should be a corresponding second - neighbor exchange , @xmath173 .",
    "just as the first neighbor exchange , @xmath174 , prefers @xmath175 pairing , the @xmath173 exchange will induce @xmath166 pairing ; the realistic case with both @xmath174 and @xmath173 non - zero should therefore prefer the intermediate @xmath172 state , with relative phase of @xmath152 ensuring that a gap opens over the entire fermion spectrum .",
    "alternatively stated , the @xmath19 fermions are already strongly paired in the @xmath175 state , while the @xmath15 fermions are essentially unpaired ; the system will try to lower its energy by pairing the @xmath15 fermions , and this is most efficiently done by an additional @xmath166 component to the pair wave - function .",
    "an additional @xmath35 component would also do the job , but has the disadvantage of also deforming the already optimal pairing of the @xmath19 , and so is not as efficient .",
    "our mean - field calculations @xcite on models with @xmath174 , @xmath173 both non - zero are consistent with these expectations .",
    "we can therefore identify the coupling @xmath176 in fig  [ fig3 ] as @xmath177 .",
    "it is also important to note that the instability from a @xmath175 superconductor to a @xmath172 superconductor occurs below a finite value of the coupling @xmath44 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with pairing instabilities of a fermi liquid , which occur at infinitesimal attraction , and so the analog of the effective action ( [ si ] ) has a logarithmic dependence upon the order parameter .",
    "however , when the parent state is a @xmath175-wave superconductor , the vanishing density of states at the fermi level removes the usual bcs log divergence , and a finite attraction is required for further pairing in the @xmath166 channel .",
    "only such a _ finite - coupling _ quantum phase transition can be described by an interacting quantum field theory with hyperscaling properties , and which leads to a @xmath178 quantum - critical region with lifetimes of order @xmath164 .",
    "further tests of the above scenario will be provided by computations of transport properties , including the optical conductivities and the hall coefficient , in the quantum - critical region of fig  [ fig3 ] for the case where @xmath97 is the @xmath179 superconductor : these are currently in progress .",
