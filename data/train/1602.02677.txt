    "thermodynamics of these systems has also been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "there is another systems also referred to as the 2d ocp , in which the interaction potential is defined via the 2d poisson equation and scales logarithmically with distance .",
    "the logarithmic potential , corresponding to the interaction of infinite charged filaments , is often employed to model interactions between vortices in thin - film superconductors .",

    "even higher @xmath14 , the glass transition has been predicted for 3d ocp  @xcite . this can also be a scenario for 2d ocp , but we are not aware of any work in this direction .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the ocp ( in both 2d and 3d ) have been extensively studied over decades and accurate numerical results as well as their fits are available in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , there has also been considerable continuous interest in deriving physically motivated analytical estimates or bounds on the thermodynamic quantities ( in particular , internal energy ) of the ocp .",
    "for example , analytical approaches of various complexity and accuracy have been discussed in refs .",
    "below , we briefly remind some of the results particularly relevant to the present discussion .",
    "mermin @xcite demonstrated that the internal energy of the 3d ocp is bounded below by the debye - hckel ( dh ) value .",
    "this demonstration is quite general and should be applicable to the 2d case with logarithmic interactions , too .",
    "this bound is a reasonable measure of the actual ocp energy at weak coupling .",
    "lieb and narnhofer @xcite derived another exact lower bound on the reduced energy ( energy per particle in units of system temperature ) of the 3d ocp , which reads @xmath22 .",
    "this result is often refereed to as the ion sphere model @xcite ( ism ) and provides rather good estimate of the internal energy at strong coupling .",
    "similar lower bound has been identified for the 2d ocp with logarithmic interactions by sari and merlini  @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath23 and is usually referred to as the ion disc model ( idm ) .",
    "again , idm is surprisingly accurate at strong coupling .",
    "gryaznov and iosilevskiy @xcite , and later independently nordholm @xcite , proposed a simple modification of the dh theory for 3d , called `` dh plus hole '' ( dhh ) approximation , based on the recognition that the exponential particle density must be truncated close to the particles so as not to become negative .",
    "it improves considerably the dh theory at moderate coupling , @xmath24 , but exhibits improper scaling ( @xmath25 ) in the high-@xmath14 limit .",
    "this approach can be extended to the 2d ocp with logarithmic interactions , as we demonstrate below .",
    "more recently , caillol derived two other exact lower bounds for the internal energy@xcite , which have been demonstrated to be in better agreement with the numerical results than those obtained previously in a wide range of @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we summarize yet another simple analytical scheme to estimate the internal energy of the ocp in 3d and 2d .",
    "the approach is based on the hybrid dhh + ism / idm consideration formulated below .",
    "simple electrostatic consideration , involving the solution of the poisson equation , is used and thus , in 2d case , the approach is limited to the logarithmic interaction .",
    "it produces expressions , which reduce to the dh result at weak coupling and to the ism / idm results at strong coupling and provide reasonable interpolation between these limits .",
    "second , we briefly summarize simple and accurate fits for all three ocp systems discussed here .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that in the 2d ocp the thermal component of the internal energy exhibits the same scaling for coulomb and logarithmic interactions .",
    "similar scaling also holds for yukawa interactions near the ocp limit ( long screening length ) and this suggests that it is a universal property of soft repulsive particle systems in 2d .",
    "based on these accurate scalings of the internal energy other thermodynamic properties can be easily calculated .",
    "finally , we briefly compare the location of the fluid - crystal phase transition in 2d ocp with coulomb and logarithmic interactions , as estimated using the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) theory .",
    "the solution of the linear poisson - boltzmann equation , @xmath26 , in 3d and 2d yields @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the zero - order modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath29 is the inverse screening length .",
    "note the relations @xmath30 in 3d and @xmath31 in 2d . the reduced excess ( that over non - charged particles ) energy of the systems , independently of dimensionality , can be evaluated from @xmath32_{r\\rightarrow 0}}{2t},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the number of the particles ( @xmath34 in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this corresponds to the dh approximation for the weakly coupled ( @xmath15 ) limit : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the euler s constant ( we used the expansion @xmath37 for @xmath38 ) .",
    "the dh approximation provides accurate results only in the limit of extremely weak coupling .      to extend the applicability of the dh approach to the moderately coupled ocp ,",
    "the simple phenomenological `` debye - hckel plus hole '' ( dhh ) approximation was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind the dhh approximation is that the exponential particle density must be truncated close to a test particle in order to avoid density to be negative upon linearization .",
    "the dhh approach was originally applied to the 3d ocp . here",
    "we outline its application to the 2d case , but 3d results are also summarized for completeness .    the potential inside the hole ( sphere in 3d and disk in 2d cases ) of radius @xmath39 can be written as @xmath40 outside the hole , the potential satisfies the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation , so that @xmath41 the two solutions should be matched at @xmath42 , requiring @xmath43 ( the last condition ensures that particle density vanishes at the hole boundary in the linear approximation ) and @xmath44 . using the identity @xmath45 we get the following equations for @xmath46 @xmath47^{1/3}-1\\right\\}^2,\\qquad ( 3\\rm d ) \\\\",

    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "now we discuss the recently proposed hybrid approach to the excess energy of 3d and 2d ocp , which tends to reproduce the dh and ism ( idm ) results in the respective limits of weak and strong coupling , and provides reasonable interpolation between these limits  @xcite .",

    "for strongly coupled systems , the reduced excess energy can be conveniently divided into static and thermal components @xmath87 the static contribution corresponds to the value of internal energy when the particles are frozen in some regular configuration ( e.g. , crystalline lattice for solids ) , and the thermal corrections arise due the deviations from these fixed positions , associated with thermal fluctuations . when the value of the static component of the excess energy is specified , the thermal component determines the excess energy and other thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "it is known that the thermal energy exhibits quasi - universal scaling for soft repulsive interactions in 3d ( first proposed by rosenfeld and tarazona ( rt )  @xcite ) and two interesting questions arise : ( i ) how accurate is the rt scaling for 3d ocp ; and ( ii ) whether there is some analog of the rt scaling in 2d .",
