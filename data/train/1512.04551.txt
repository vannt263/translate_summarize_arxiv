    "several studies have highlighted the presence of obscured agn emission in high - redshift sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "k_-band  counterparts . for most cosmos agns the spectral information is based on the zcosmos - bright survey ( see ) , which imposes an optical flux limit of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "additional spectroscopic follow - up available for cosmos ( x - ray ) agns provides several other @xmath27 x - ray - selected broad - line sources with @xmath64 , well beyond the zcosmos limit . these are , however , generally too faint to be included in our sample in terms of the _",
    "k_-band  cut we imposed , motivated by the need to observe a sizable sample .",
    "we conclude that our sample is highly representative of the population of unobscured cosmos agns at z3 - 3.7 @xmath38 , down to a flux limit of @xmath46 . as the sample",
    "is mainly limited by ( rest - frame ) uv and optical flux selection , it may only be biased against highly obscured agns , either in the x - rays or in the ( rest - frame ) uv .",

    "the four @xmath2  agns are powered by yet smaller smbhs , with typical ( median ) masses of @xmath371 , accreting at normalized rates of @xmath372 .",

    "* i.e. , those agns with @xmath373 ) .    as mentioned in , our chosen flux limit for the @xmath1  agns",
    "means we could have recovered sources with masses as low as @xmath374 or with accretion rates as low as @xmath52 .",
    "however , as demonstrates , the majority of @xmath1  sources in our sample do not reach these lower limits .",
    "the accretion rates we find ( @xmath375 ) are about an order of magnitude above the estimated survey limit . given the flux limit of the sample , objects with @xmath376 should have @xmath377 in order to be included in our study .",
    "indeed , the only object with @xmath378 is , again , the extremely massive source cid-947 , which reaches @xmath370 .",
    "this low value , as well as other , indirect evidence , indicates that this source is most probably observed at the final stages of smbh growth , after accreting at much higher rates at yet higher redshifts .",
    "several previous studies of the distributions of  did identify significant populations of intermediate - redshift agns ( @xmath379 ) with @xmath380 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . specifically , the low-  agns studied in @xcite and @xcite have bh masses comparable to those studied here .",
    "we conclude that our sample presents compelling evidence for the lack of high - mass , slowly accreting smbhs - with @xmath381 and @xmath382 .",
    "such sources would `` fill the gap '' between most of the @xmath1  sources and cid-947  in .",
    "however , larger samples are needed to establish this conclusion more firmly .      given reliable estimates of , and further assuming that the accretion onto the smbhs occurs within a thin accretion disk , one can derive prescriptions for the estimation of the _ physical _ accretion rate ( i.e. , in yr^-1 @xmath383 ) through the accretion disk , .",
    "several studies derived such prescriptions based on the classical accretion disk model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , @xcite ) , or on more elaborate models that take into account additional complex processes ( e.g. , general relativistic effects , comptonization , and winds ; see @xcite , and references therein ) . generally , such prescriptions require measurements of the ( rest - frame ) optical luminosity of the agns , which is predominantly emitted by the outer parts of the accretion disk , and is thus mostly unaffected by the spin of the smbh .",
    "we estimated  for the 12  agns with mass determinations using the prescription presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) : @xmath384 where @xmath385 , @xmath386 , and @xmath387 represents the inclination of the accretion disk with regard to the line of sight , assumed here to be @xmath388 ( see @xcite for the full analytical expression and more details ) .",
    "the resulting accretion rates of the @xmath1  agns are in the range of @xmath389 .",
    "a comparison of the  values obtained through and those estimated from  ( ) suggests that , for most of the sources , the observed data are broadly consistent with a radiatively efficient accretion with @xmath390 , as assumed in some of the evolutionary calculations presented in this paper .",
    "however , we note that a more detailed examination reveals that the _ typical _ ( median ) radiative efficiency needed to account for the observed , given the  estimates , is somewhat higher , at about @xmath391 .",
    "the only outlier is cid-947  for which the two  estimates suggest a very high radiative efficiency , reaching ( and formally exceeding ) the maximum value allowed within the standard accretion disk theory , of @xmath392 .",
    "we note that while cid-947  has an extremely low  ( @xmath650.02 ) , its physical accretion rate of about @xmath393 is low but not extreme .",
    "two other sources ( lid-775 and lid-504 ) have comparably low , despite the fact that their masses are lower than that of cid-947  by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the typically high radiative efficiencies we find are in agreement with the results of several previous studies reporting similar findings for high - mass and/or high - redshift smbhs , relying either on direct measurements of the iron k@xmath394 line @xcite , on arguments similar to the one presented here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or on indirect evidence involving the agn population as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the  estimates can be used to derive an initial set of estimates of growth time for the smbhs under study , defined as @xmath395 .",
    "simply assuming @xmath396 , we derive growth times that are generally in the range of @xmath397 gyr , again showing that most of the accretion should have happened at higher redshifts .",
    "cid-947  has an extremely long timescale of @xmath398 gyr .",
    "these timescales are generally longer , by a factor of about 1.6 , than those derived from  alone ( see below ) .      assuming a smbh accretes matter with a constant  and radiative efficiency , its mass increases exponentially with time , with a typical @xmath399-folding timescale of @xmath400 if one further assumes a certain initial ( seed ) bh mass , , then the time required to grow from  to the observed , , is @xmath401 for the @xmath1  agns studied here , the @xmath399-folding timescales are in the range @xmath402 gyr , assuming @xmath396 .",
    "for the lower - redshift sources the timescales are shorter , at about 0.1 gyr . further assuming that @xmath403 , @xmath404 , or @xmath405 results in growth times in the range of @xmath406 , @xmath407 , or @xmath408 gyr , respectively , for the @xmath1  sources , excluding cid-947",
    "the atypically low accretion rate of cid-947  translates to an @xmath399-folding timescale of 2 gyr . even in the most favorable scenario of @xmath409 ,",
    "the growth time is longer than the age of the universe ( at the observed epoch ) , suggesting that cid-947  must have experienced a dramatic drop in  ( see t15 for a detailed discussion ) .    in",
    "we illustrate several evolutionary tracks for the smbhs in our sample , since @xmath410 .",
    "the simplest scenario assumes that each smbh grows with a constant , fixed to the observed value .",
    "the points where each of the ( diagonal solid ) lines crosses the y - axis of the _ left _ panel of may be considered as the implied ( seed ) bh mass at @xmath410 , under these assumptions .",
    "the @xmath2  sources have high - enough accretion rates to account for their observed masses , even if one assumes that they originate from `` stellar '' bh seeds ( @xmath411 ) and/or a fractional duty cycle for accretion . among the @xmath1  sources , however , we see some evidence for either more massive seeds and/or higher accretion rates in yet earlier epochs , as the implied seed masses are typically of order @xmath412 . to illustrate the effect of having higher  at earlier epochs , we repeated the calculation of evolutionary tracks , this time assuming that  increases with redshift , as suggested by several studies of higher - luminosity agns ( see , and also @xcite ) .",
    "we assume two very simple evolutionary trends , of the form @xmath413 and @xmath414 , both capped at the eddington limit ( i.e. , @xmath415 ) .",
    "the stronger evolutionary trend is consistent with a fit to all the data points in the bottom panel of .",
    "the results of this latter calculation are illustrated as dashed lines in .  and",
    "@xmath351  sources have observed accretion rates above the eddington limit , but those could well be due to the uncertainties related to  estimation . ]",
    "these calculations suggest that massive seeds are required to explain _ some _",
    "@xmath1  sources , even under these favorable conditions .",
    "the only scenario in which all the implied seed masses are in the `` stellar '' regime is indeed the one with the strongest evolution in accretion rates , @xmath414 .",
    "we note , however , that all these calculations assume continuous growth , i.e. a duty cycle of 100% .",
    "any other , more realistic choice for the duty cycle , as well as the indirect evidence for somewhat elevated radiative efficiencies for some of the agns ( ) , would further challenge the ability of stellar bh seeds to account for the observed bh masses .",
    "another interesting point that is clearly evident from is that most of the smbhs studied here _ can not _",
    "be considered as the descendants of the known higher - redshift smbhs .",
    "this is due to the simple fact that the observed masses of the z3.3 @xmath416  smbhs are lower than , or comparable to , those of the higher - redshift ones .",
    "the only exception for this interpretation ( except for cid-947 ) would be a scenario where the lowest - mass smbhs at @xmath352  would shut off their accretion within a very short timescale , and then be briefly `` re - activated '' at @xmath18 .",
    "however , given the large difference between the number densities of the population from which our sample is drawn and that of the higher - redshift , higher - luminosity samples shown in ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this scenario is unlikely .",
    "the evolutionary tracks we calculate for our @xmath1  sources , combined with the associated number density of their parent population , strongly support the existence of a significant population of relatively low - mass ( @xmath417 ) , active smbhs at @xmath418 .",
    "moreover , as the right panel of shows , such sources should be observable , as their luminosities are expected to exceed the flux limits of existing deep x - ray surveys , such as the  itself , or the 4 ms cdf - s survey @xcite .",
    "however , very few such sources are indeed detected .",
    "several surveys of optically selected , unobscured agns at @xmath418 suggest number densities of order @xmath419 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . even when combining all currently available x - ray surveys , and including _ all _ sources with redshifts @xmath11 , the number density of the sources that have comparable luminosities to what we predict here ( @xmath420 ) is roughly @xmath421 .",
    "in particular , the recent study of @xcite identified about 30 x - ray agns at @xmath422 , based on the same x - ray  data used for the selection of the sample studied here .",
    "of these sources , nine are at @xmath364 and only four are at @xmath423 , with the vast majority of such high-@xmath60 sources having only photometric redshift estimates . in terms of the typical luminosities of these agns ,",
    "the right panel of clearly shows that the @xmath11 x - ray agns can indeed be considered as the parent population of our sources .",
    "however , the number density of such high-@xmath60 agns is significantly lower than that of our sample .",
    "the marchesi et al .",
    "study shows that the cumulative number density of x - ray - selected agns drops dramatically with increasing redshift , to reach @xmath424 by @xmath425 ( split roughly equally between obscured and unobscured agns ) , and to about @xmath426 by @xmath427 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude lower than what we consider for the @xmath427 progenitors of our sources .",
    "this discrepancy is _ not _ driven by the ( x - ray ) flux limit of the .",
    "indeed , the study of @xcite did not identify any ( x - ray - selected ) @xmath428 agns in the 4 ms cdf - s data , the deepest available survey @xcite .",
    "sources in the cdf - s field .",
    "however , their technique for identifying x - ray sources goes far beyond the standard procedures used in the x - ray luminosity function studies we refer to here , and may introduce false detections .",
    "] as illustrated in the right panel of , the 4 ms cdf - s data should have easily detected the progenitors of our sources .",
    "we note that the lack of such higher - redshift sources is _ not _ due to the small size of the cdf - s survey , because it does contain some high - luminosity agns at @xmath11 . in principle , given the general behavior of luminosity functions , the lower - luminosity progenitors of our @xmath1  agns should have been even more numerous .",
    "we conclude that our sample provides compelling evidence for the existence of a significant population ( @xmath429 ) of faint @xmath6 agns , powered by smbhs with @xmath430 and @xmath431 , which , however , is not detected ( at sufficiently large numbers ) in the currently available deep x - rays surveys .",
    "we note that while the decline in the number density of agns at @xmath27 was well established in several previous studies , including those based on  data in cosmos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m15 ) , our analysis clearly demonstrates that such `` progenitor '' agns are _ expected _ , given the masses and accretion rates of the @xmath1  agns .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy between the expected and observed number of @xmath428 agnss :    1 .",
    "first , the small number of detected `` progenitor '' systems can be explained by a high fraction of obscured agns ( f_obs @xmath432 ) .",
    "if the obscuration of each accreting smbh evolves with the luminosity of the central source , then we should expect that a certain fraction of the progenitors of our sources would be obscured at earlier epochs .",
    "such a scenario is expected within the framework of `` receding torus '' models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where lower luminosities are typically associated with a higher f_obs @xmath432 .",
    "however , several recent studies show that there is little observational evidence in support of such torus models ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "there is , however , somewhat stronger evidence for an increase in the typical f_obs @xmath432  toward high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps in concert with an increasing frequency of major galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a more plausible scenario is therefore that the progenitors of our @xmath1  agns are embedded in dusty galaxy merger environments with high - column density .",
    "second , it is possible that , early on , our sources grew with lower radiative efficiencies , which would result in yet - lower luminosities per given ( physical ) accretion rate . to illustrate the possible effects of lower  on the projected evolutionary tracks of our sources , we repeated the aforementioned evolutionary calculations with @xmath433 ( comparable to the lowest possible value within the standard model of a thin accretion disk ) . indeed , at @xmath428 the expected luminosities are significantly lower than those projected under the fiducial assumptions . the differences amount to at least an order of magnitude at @xmath11 , and at least a factor of 30 at @xmath427 , making most of these projected progenitors undetectable even in the deepest surveys . in this context , we recall that the efficiencies we infer for the sources are actually somewhat _ higher _ than standard ( @xmath434 ; ) .",
    "however , lower efficiencies at earlier times may still be expected if one assumes , for example , a relatively prolonged accretion episode that ( gradually ) `` spins up '' the smbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or supercritical accretion through `` slim '' accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   finally",
    ", the discrepancy may be explained in terms of the agn duty cycle , on either long ( host - scale fueling ) or short ( accretion flow variability ) timescales . in the present context , this would require that high - redshift , lower - luminosity agns would have a lower duty cycle than their ( slightly ) lower - redshift descendants .",
    "we note that such a scenario would actually further complicate the situation , as the growth of the smbhs would be slower .",
    "this , in turn , would mean that our sources should be associated with progenitors of yet higher luminosity at @xmath428 , which have yet lower number densities .",
    "we conclude that the simplest explanation for the discrepancy between the observed and expected properties of the progenitors of our @xmath1  agns is probably due to a combination of an evolution in the radiative efficiencies and/or obscuration fractions , during the growth of individual systems .",
    "we stress that such trends are beyond the scope of most `` synthesis models , '' which assume time - invariable accretion rates , radiative efficiencies , and/or obscuration fractions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we have presented new keck / mosfire _",
    "k_-band  spectra for a total of  unobscured , @xmath34 agns , selected through the extensive  x - ray coverage of the cosmos field .",
    "we mainly focus on  objects at @xmath1 , representing a parent population with a number density of roughly @xmath435 - a factor of @xmath436 more abundant than previously studied samples of agns at these high redshifts .",
    "the new data enabled us to measure the black hole masses ( ) and accretion rates ( both in terms of  and ) for these sources , and to trace their early growth .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "the @xmath1  agns are powered by smbhs with typical masses of @xmath437 and accretion rates of @xmath5 .",
    "these bh masses are significantly lower than those found for higher - luminosity agns at comparable redshifts .",
    "our sample generally lacks agns powered by high - mass but slowly accreting smbhs ( i.e. , @xmath378 ) , although such systems are well within our chosen flux limit . assuming a standard , thin accretion disk , the data suggest somewhat higher - than - typical radiative efficiencies , of about @xmath438 , in agreement with several recent studies .",
    "2 .   assuming continuous growth at the observed accretion rates , most of the @xmath1  smbhs had to grow from massive bh seeds ( i.e. , @xmath439 ) .",
    "stellar seeds can only account for the observed masses if  was higher at yet earlier epochs .",
    "however , invoking any reasonable duty cycle for the accretion , as well as the indirect evidence for somewhat higher - than - standard radiative efficiencies , further complicates the scenario of stellar bh seeds .",
    "our analysis predicts the existence of a large population of @xmath440 agns , with @xmath441 , @xmath442 , and @xmath443 .",
    "such sources are not detected in sufficiently large numbers in the existing deep x - ray surveys , perhaps because of increased obscuration at high redshift and/or because of lower radiative efficiences in the early stages of black hole growth .",
    "two of the @xmath1  sources , and possibly one additional source ( @xmath444 ) have extremely weak broad  emission components , although their ( archival ) optical spectra clearly show strong emission from other , high - ionization broad lines ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the weakness of the broad  lines _ can not _ be due to dust obscuration along the line of sight , nor due to the lack of blr gas . a sudden decrease in agn ( continuum )",
    "luminosity is also improbable .",
    "another source shows a peculiarly broad  profile .",
    "repeated optical spectroscopy of these sources may clarify the physical mechanisms that drive the highly unusual broad - line emission .",
    "one source in our sample , the broad - absorption - line agn cid-947 , has a significantly higher  and lower  than the rest of the sample . our detailed analysis ( published separately as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the smbh in this system is at the final phase of growth .",
    "compared with the rest of the sample analyzed here ,",
    "cid-947  appears to be an outlier in the general distributions of  and .",
    "we stress , however , that it is highly unlikely that systems like cid-947  are extremely rare , as we have identified one such object among a sample of ten .",
    "our sample presents preliminary insights into key properties of _ typical _ smbhs at @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , a larger sample of faint agns is needed in order to establish the black hole mass function and accretion rate function at this early cosmic epoch . we are pursuing these goals by relying on the ( relatively ) unbiased selection function enabled by deep x - ray surveys , in extragalactic fields where a rich collection of supporting multi - wavelength data are available .",
    "a forthcoming publication will explore the host galaxies of the agns studied here , and trace the evolution of the well - known smbh - host scaling relations to @xmath18 .",
