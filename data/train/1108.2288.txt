    "this note summarizes the statistical methods used so far by the atlas collaboration for setting upper limits or establishing a discovery , and includes the recommended approaches for future analyses , as recently agreed in the context of the atlas statistics forum .",
    "the recommendations aim at achieving a better uniformity across different physics analyses and their ultimate goal is to improve the sensitivity to new phenomena , while keeping robustness as a fundamental request .",
    "the best way to be safe against false discoveries is to compare the results obtained using at least two different methods , at least when one is very near the `` five sigma '' threshold which is required in high - energy physics ( hep ) to claim a discovery .",
    "one recommended method is explained in this paper ( section  [ sec - recomm ] ) .",
    "we focus here on the searches for some type of `` signal '' in a sample of events dominated by other ( `` background '' ) physical sources .",
    "the events are the output of a particle detector , filtered by reconstruction algorithms which compute high - level features like an `` electron '' or a `` jet '' .",
    "large use of simulated samples is required to tune calibrations , characterize the event reconstruction , and compare the outcome of an experiment with the theoretical models .",
    "a typical simulation consists of few different steps .",
    "first , one needs to simulate the result of the primary particle interaction with the help of an `` event generator '' .",
    "usually , only one specific process of interest is considered ( e.g.  higgs production with a specific channel ) and saved to disk , allowing the physicist to study a well defined type of `` signal '' .",
    "different monte carlo ( mc ) productions are then organized to obtain a set of processes which , depending on the analysis , can be considered either signal or background .",
    "the next step is to simulate the effects of the passage of the produced particles ( and their decay products ) through the detector .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the ways energy is deposited in each material and defines the `` tracking '' of the simulated particles up to the point in which they decay , leave the detector or stop .",
    "finally , the detector response is simulated : for each energy deposition into an active material , another mc process produces the electronic signal .",
    "the latter is processed in a way which closely follows the design of the front - end electronics , obtaining the simulated detector output in the same format as the data coming from the real detector .",
    "statistical uncertainties arise from fluctuations in the energy deposition in the active materials and from the electronic noise .",
    "systematics due to the limited knowledge of the real detector performance and to the details of the offline reconstruction also contribute to the final uncertainty and need to be addressed case by case .",
    "finally , theoretical uncertainties in the physical models need also to be accounted for . in general , the differences among the event generators can not be treated as standard deviations , because one usually has just two or three available generators .",
    "hence they should not be summed in quadrature but treated separately .",
    "section  [ sec - notation ] summarizes the statistical aspects relevant to our problems and defines some notation .",
    "the methods applied in past atlas publications are reviewed in section  [ sec - past - methods ] , while section  [ sec - recomm ] focuses on the methods which can be used in future analyses .",
    "in hep we deal with hypothesis testing when making inferences about the `` true physical model '' : one has to take a decision ( e.g. exclusion , discovery ) given the experimental data . in the classical approach proposed by fisher",
    ", one may decide to reject the hypothesis if the _ @xmath0-value _ , which is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic in the assumption that the null hypothesis @xmath1 is true , is lower than some threshold . in the search for new phenomena ,",
    "the @xmath0-value is interpreted as the probability to observe at least as many events as the outcome of our experiment in the hypothesis of no new physics .",
    "alternatively , one may convert the @xmath0-value into the _ significance _",
    "@xmath2 , which is the number of gaussian standard deviations which correspond to the same right - tail probability : @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath4 is the quantile of the normal distribution , expressed in terms of the inverse error function .",
    "a @xmath0-value threshold of 0.05 corresponds to @xmath5 and is commonly used in hep for setting upper limits ( or one - sided confidence limits ) with 95% confidence level . on the other hand , it is customary to require at least a `` five sigma '' level @xmath6 ( i.e.  @xmath7 ) in order to claim for a discovery of a new phenomenon ( if @xmath8 one usually says only that the data suggest the evidence for something new ) .",
    "it is also common to quantify the sensitivity of an experiment by reporting the expected significance under the assumption of different hypotheses .",
    "another possible approach , suggested by neyman and pearson , is to compare two alternative hypotheses ( if the null hypothesis is the main focus of the analysis and no other model is of interest , the alternative @xmath9 can be defined as the negation of @xmath1 ) . in this case ,",
    "two figures of merit are to be taken into account :    * the _ _ size _ _ is also known as `` significance level '' of the test .",
    "we do not use this terminology to avoid confusion with the significance @xmath2 defined above . ]",
    "@xmath10 of the test , which is the probability of incorrectly rejecting @xmath1 in favour of @xmath9 when @xmath1 is true .",
    "@xmath10 is also the false positive ( or `` type i error '' ) rate ; * the _ power _ of the test @xmath11 , which is the probability of correctly rejecting @xmath1 in favour of @xmath9 when @xmath1 is false .",
    "@xmath12 is the probability of failing to reject a false hypothesis , i.e.  the false negative ( or `` type ii error '' ) rate .    in the bayesian approach ,",
    "one always compares two ( or more ) different hypotheses . in order to take the decision among the alternatives",
    ", one can look at the posterior odds or at the ratio of the marginal likelihoods ( or `` bayes factor '' ) .",
    "the former are always well defined and take into account the information accumulated with the performed experiment in the light of the existing prior information , whereas the latter is often very difficult to compute and may even be ill - defined in some problem ( for example when comparing two models in which one of the priors is improper ) , although it does not depend on the prior knowledge about the hypothesis under consideration .",
    "the decision is taken in favour of the hypothesis which maximizes the chosen ratio , though the particular value of the latter can can suggest a weak , mild or strong preference for that hypothesis .    in this note",
    ", we address two problems , exclusion and discovery , for which the notation is different and sometimes misleading , as illustrated below .",
    "for this reason , in the rest of the paper we will speak about the `` signal plus background '' ( sig+bkg or @xmath13 ) hypothesis and about the `` background only '' ( bkg or @xmath14 ) hypothesis , without specifying which is the null hypothesis .    in the discovery problem , the null hypothesis @xmath1 describes the background only , while the alternative @xmath9 describes signal plus background . in the classical approach ,",
    "one first requires that the @xmath0-value of @xmath1 is found below the given threshold ( in hep one requires @xmath7 ) . if this condition is satisfied , one looks for an alternative hypothesis which can explain well the data .    in the exclusion problem ,",
    "the situation is reversed : @xmath1 describes signal plus background while the alternative hypothesis @xmath9 describes the background only . in the classical approach ,",
    "one just makes use of the null hypothesis to set the upper limit , though this will exclude with probability @xmath15 parameters values for which one has little sensitivity , obtaining `` lucky '' results .",
    "historically , this problem has been first addressed in the hep community by the cl@xmath16 method @xcite , whose approach is to reject the sig+bkg hypothesis if cls @xmath17 .",
    "cls is a ratio of @xmath0-values which is commonly use in hep , and one can find a probabilistic interpretation if certain asymptotic conditions are met @xcite .",
    "another possibility being discussed by atlas physicists is to construct a power constrained upper limit ( pcl ) by requiring that two conditions hold at the same time : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-value is lower than the chosen threshold , and ( 2 ) the power of the test is larger than a minimum value chosen in advance .",
    "so far , different atlas analyses used different approaches . converging takes time and is not always possible nor necessarily good , the main reason probably being that different uncertainties are addressed in different ways .",
    "whenever possible , the background is estimated from data .",
    "still , one has to extrapolate to the signal region and this requires the knowledge of the shape , and hence depends on the simulation .",
    "in addition , in many cases signal and control regions should be treated at the same time : systematics affect both signal and background and often it is impossible to find a signal free region . finally , in most cases the background is composed of several contributions which are independently simulated but are not really independent : systematic effects act on all of them , making things more and more complicate .",
    "accounting simultaneously for systematic effects on different components is now possible thanks to histfactory , a root @xcite tool for a coherent treatment of systematics based on roofit / roostats @xcite , initially developed by k. cranmer and a. shibata .",
    "first used in the top group @xcite , histfactory is now being adopted also by other atlas groups .    searches for new physics ( for example , higgs searches ) often start by looking for a `` bump '' in a distribution which is dominated by the background .",
    "when the location of the bump is not know , the search is typically repeated in different windows , decreasing the sensitivity @xcite . in the atlas dijet resonance search @xcite ,",
    "a tool for systematic scans with different methods has been applied : bumphunter , developed g. choudalakis @xcite .",
    "the program makes a brute force scan for all possible bump locations and widths , achieving a very good sensitivity , and is appropriate when the bump position and/or width are not known .",
    "a hybrid bayesian - frequentist approach has been used by the lep and tevatron higgs working groups and is also used in atlas higgs searches .",
    "all or some nuisance parameters ( modeling systematic effects ) are treated in the bayesian way : a prior is defined for each parameter which is integrated over . on the other hand , for the parameters of interest the frequentist approach",
    "is followed , computing @xmath0-values and constructing confidence intervals .",
    "histfactory can be used also with this approach , supporting normal , gamma and log - normal priors for nuisance parameters .    in the higgs combination chapter in the atlas ``",
    "csc book '' @xcite , the statistical combination of sm higgs searches in 4 different channels ( using mc data ) was performed with roofit / roostats in the frequentist approach : systematics have been incorporated by profile likelihood .",
    "each search was performed with a fixed mass and repeated for different values , and the limits have been interpolated .",
    "many lessons have been learned and the statistical treatment has been refined since then , culminating in the recommended frequentist method explained in section  [ sec - recomm - freq ] below .",
    "if possible , one may consider using more than a single approach in searches for new phenomena : if they agree , one gains confidence in the result ; if they disagree , one must understand why ( possibly finding flaws in the analysis ) .",
    "this becomes expecially important when the obtained sensitivity is close to the minimum limit for discovery .",
    "section  [ sec - recomm - freq ] below summarizes the recently proposed frequentist approach which is being recommended for all atlas analyses .",
    "a possibility is to test the result of the frequentist approach with a bayesian method .",
    "the current dicussion about the bayesian approach is summarized in section  [ sec - recomm - bayes ] , but at present there is no official atlas recommendation about it .",
    "the problem is formulated by stating that the expected number of events in bin @xmath18 is the sum @xmath19 of two separate contributions , a background expectation of @xmath20 events and a signal contribution given by the product of an intensity parameter @xmath21 with the expected number of signal events @xmath22 . for discovery , we test the background - only hypothesis @xmath23 .",
    "if there is no significant evidence against such hypothesis , we set an upper limit on the magnitude of the intensity parameter .    the reader will find a full treatment of the recommended method in ref .",
    "very shortly , the profile likelihood is used to construct different statistics for testing the alternative bkg and sig+bkg hypotheses . in the asymptotic regime",
    ", confidence intervals can be found analytically using such statistics , and the resulting expressions can be used to define approximate intervals for finite samples .",
    "asymptotically , the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath24 is gaussian distributed about the true value with standard deviation @xmath25 which can be found numerically by means of the `` asimov dataset '' , defined as the mc sample which , when used to estimate all parameters , gives their true values . in case of exclusion ,",
    "the approximate upper limit ( with its uncertainty ) is @xmath26 . in case of discovery ,",
    "in which one assumes @xmath27 , the median significance is @xmath28 = \\sqrt{2 [ ( s+b ) \\ln(1 + s / b ) -s ] }       \\ ; , \\ ] ] which is the recommended formula for a counting experiment by the atlas statistics forum when estimating the sensitivity for discovery @xcite .      in the bayesian approach ,",
    "the full solution to an inference problem about the `` true physical model '' , which is responsible for the outcome of an experiment , is provided by the posterior probability distribution of the parameter of interest .",
    "typically , there are several nuisance parameters which model systematic effects or uninteresting degrees of freedom . in order to obtain the marginal posterior probability distribution as a function only of the parameter of interest",
    ", one has to integrate over all nuisance parameters .",
    "this marginalization procedure contrasts with the frequentist approach based on the profile likelihood , in which the nuisance parameters are fixed at their `` best '' values .",
    "prior probabilities need to be specified for all parameters and should model our knowledge about the effects which they refer to . quite often",
    ", one does not want to encode a precise model into the prior or does not assume any relevant prior information . in this case",
    ", uniform densities are commonly preferred for computational reasons , but they are often misinterpreted as `` non - informative '' priors , which is not the case .",
    "for example , a uniform density is no more flat , when considered as a function of the logarithm of the given parameter . when attempting to make an `` objective '' inference , least - informative priors should be used instead .",
    "they can be defined , as in the case of the reference priors , as as the ones which maximize the amount of missing information @xcite .",
    "reference priors are invariant under reparametrization , are known ( and often identical to jeffreys priors ) for most common one - dimensional problems in hep , and can also be used to test the dependence of the result from the choice of the prior @xcite .",
    "when dealing with discovery or exclusion in the bayesian approach , one has to make a choice between two alternative hypotheses : background only ( @xmath14 ) and signal plus background ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "comparing the posterior probabilities is the best way to account for the whole amount of information provided by the experiment in the light of the previous knowledge .",
    "although values of @xmath29 for the posterior odds are interpreted as a strong preference , no widespread agreement exists in the hep community about a minimum threshold for claiming a discovery .- value and follow the `` five sigma '' rule mentioned above . ] in order to check the impact of the assumptions made before performing the experiment on the final decision , it is also useful to compare the posterior odds against the prior odds ( defined as the ratio of prior probabilities for @xmath14 and @xmath13 , whenever this is well defined ) .",
    "this note summarizes the statistical approaches used in the past atlas analyses and the current ongoing efforts to provide uniformity of statistical treatment across all analyses .",
    "guidelines for estimating the sensitivity with a frequentist method based on profile likelihood ratio have been recently formalized @xcite . in this approach , which is recommended for all atlas analyses ,",
    "all nuisance parameters are fixed at their best values and a single mc sample ( the asimov dataset ) can be used to find the numerical values of the interesting statistics .",
    "the bayesian approach can also be considered in the analysis , although no official atlas recommendation has been made yet about the best method . in general , the prior densities should be chosen in the way which best models our prior knowledge of the model .",
    "whenever one wants to minimize the impact of the choice of the prior on the result , one should be aware that flat priors are to be considered informative .",
    "on the other hand , least - informative priors can be defined for all common hep problems and have very appealing properties . in the bayesian approach",
    ", the treatment of systematics is different from the recommended frequentist method , because the whole range of each nuisance parameter is considered in the marginalization .",
    "hence , the comparison between the two approaches may be helpful , expecially near the sensitivity threshold for discovery ."
