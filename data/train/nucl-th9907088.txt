    "the hartree  fock  bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation was outlined more than twenty years ago @xcite for infinite systems and almost immediately was introduced in nuclear physics @xcite . in the case of infinite systems the hfb procedure is well studied and the character of the wave  functions ( w.f . )",
    "is well understood . however , in the case of finite systems ( nuclei ) , things are not so clear .",
    "the hfb equations in the case of nuclei are meaningful provided the boundary conditions for the single quasiparticle ( s.qp . )",
    "are correctly formulated in order to describe a genuine finite state .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide the correct formulation of the hfb approximation in the case of finite systems .",
    "it is well known that pairing correlations always appear whenever a pole ( i.e. a bound state ) is present in the two - body green function of the many - body system @xcite . in this case , corrections to the single particle ( s.p . )",
    "green function of the type    = 3.5 cm    give rise to diagrams of the type    = 3.5 cm    when only the contribution of the pole is taken into account @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 stands for the energy of the two  particle bound state and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the particle and hole energies respectively .",
    "the process represented by diagram ( 1 ) leads to a mixing between particle and hole states and as a result to a smearing of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "this mixing has the special feature that a hole ( particle ) can transform into a particle ( hole ) , due to the presence of the pair condensate , provided their energies are related by the energy conservation law @xmath4 whenever the energy of the hole state is less than @xmath1 the corresponding particle state to which the hole state is coupled lies in continuum .",
    "this situation formally resembles the case of an electron in a very strong field @xcite or the case of a bound state embedded in continuum @xcite .",
    "consequently , a sufficiently deep hole state becomes unstable with respect to decay into a particle state by an interaction with the pair condensate .",
    "the same thing happens in the case of a deep hole decaying into a less deeply bound hole , with the excitation of a phonon , which can further decay by particle emission .",
    "this process is described by the diagram    = 3.5 cm    where the wavy line represents a phonon .",
    "the physical situation is thus not new .",
    "new is the fact that due to the presence of the pair condensate , some hole states acquire a width and therefore the s.qp.w.fs .",
    "can no longer be treated as corresponding to bound states , as has hitherto been done , but as continuum states .",
    "how to introduce this property of the s.qp.w.fs . into the hfb approximation for finite systems and therefore how to define the boundary conditions correctly is the main goal of the present discussion .",
    "in this section the well  known hfb equations will be derived for the sake of completeness .",
    "the emphasis will be on the correct definition of s.qp.w.fs . so as to describe genuine finite systems , i.e. systems with finite matter distribution .",
    "the forces between particles will not be specified , except for some general properties , like the finite range .    by analogy with the usual hf approximation , the hfb ground state w.f .",

    "now , if one takes into account the definitions of densities @xmath77 and @xmath79 ( rels .",

    "( 2530 ) ) completely agrees with the asymptotic behaviors ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) .",
    "this means that the corresponding asymptotic behaviors are selfconsistent .",
    "it is physically natural to expect that the asymptotic behavior of the density @xmath77 is controlled by the chemical potential @xmath99 , i.e. by the energy of the least bound particle .",
    "the density of the pair condensate @xmath79 can be interpreted as the wave function of a bound state of two interacting particles in an external field with energy @xmath100 .",
    "using hfb eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) and the definition ( 8) , one can show that the density @xmath79 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath101    _ other terms negligible outside the system _ .    from this equation",

    "( 24 ) .    strictly speaking",
    ", this asymptote is correct only outside the range of @xmath26 .",

    "summing up , in the normalization conditions ( 5 ) for the single quasi - particle wave functions , the right hand side has to be interpreted as a kronecker symbol if @xmath104 and as a dirac @xmath38function if @xmath105 ( as it is well known @xcite the system ( 1112 ) has the property that if @xmath106 is a solution , then @xmath107 is a solution as well ) .",

    "as is well known , the green function diverges like @xmath118 when @xmath119 .",

    "one notices that the divergence is not logarithmic , as is usually stated in textbooks @xcite .",
    "a local pairing field corresponds to a zero range two  body interaction . then , as one can easily show by using eq .",
    "( 31 ) , the density @xmath79 will always be singular for coinciding arguments .",
    "for the entire hfb procedure to be meaningful , the two  body interaction , which is responsible for pairing , must have a finite range .",
