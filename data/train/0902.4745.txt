    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies @xcite showed a low temperature @xmath3 spin lattice relaxation rate typical of a gap with nodes .",
    "however , penetration depth measurements @xcite have been fit both to exponential activated @xmath4-dependence , indicative of a fully gapped state , and low-@xmath4 power laws .",
    "arpes measurements on single crystals of 122-type materials @xcite measured the spectral gap reporting isotropic or nearly isotropic gaps on all fermi surface sheets .",
    "it is possible that these differences reflect genuinely different ground states in different materials .",
    "however , the complex interplay of multiband effects , unconventional pairing , and disorder leaves open the possibility that a single ground state symmetry exists in all the fe - pnictides , and that differences in measured properties can be understood by accounting for electronic structure differences and disorder@xcite .",
    "it is likely that a consensus will be reached only after careful measurements using various probes on the same material , and systematic disorder studies .",
    "we argue here that measurement of the electronic raman scattering in the superconducting state can provide important information on the structure of the bulk superconducting order parameter through its sensitivity to both symmetry and gap scales . here",
    "we discuss the raman scattering for some simple models of the fe - pnictide superconductors .",
    "in general the energy of the peaks in the raman intensity are directly related to the magnitude of the gaps on the various fermi sheets .",
    "however , whether a given raman polarization weights a given gap strongly or weakly depends on the polarization state of the measurement via the raman vertex @xmath5 .",
    "this is particularly important for superconductors where the gap is strongly momentum dependent , and was exploited successfully in cuprate materials to help determine the @xmath6-wave symmetry in those systems@xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of nodes and the dimensionality of the nodal manifold may be determined by comparison with low energy power laws in the raman intensity in different polarization states .    in the fe - pnictide materials , density functional theory calculations@xcite for the paramagnetic state",

    "while arpes experiments@xcite have reported weakly anisotropic gaps , this may be due to momentum resolution issues and the difficulty of preparing good surfaces in these systems at present .",
    "in particular , the samples used in these experiments may be sufficiently dirty at the surface that considerable momentum averaging , with concomitant gap averaging , could be taking place@xcite .",
    "angle - dependent specific heat measurements in a magnetic field@xcite , which probe the bulk , may be feasible in the future but are difficult at present due to the requirement of large clean crystals .",
    "raman scattering with use of different polarizations may therefore be the best current method of acquiring momentum - dependent information on the structure of the bulk superconducting order parameter .",
    "we discuss several cases below which should allow extraction of the crude momentum dependence and possible nodal structure of the order parameter over the fermi surface . some of these cases have been considered in an earlier paper by chubukov et al.@xcite , who however focussed solely on the @xmath0 polarization , and examined vertex corrections due to short - range interactions .",

    "charge backflow \" effect of the long - range part of the coulomb interaction which is required to ensure charge conservation . here",
    "we show that for the @xmath0 case , significant changes are to be expected due to the coupling of the @xmath0 raman charge fluctuations due to the backflow effects .    while the expressions for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are generally well - characterized by the bare bubble calculation for the cuprates , it is well - known that the @xmath0 contribution is significantly more complicated due to the issue of charge backflow as noted above , and to the number of different excitons which may be pulled down from a gap edge condensate . in systems with several condensate pairing instabilities lying in close proximity in parameter space , strong excitonic peaks may occur . while the possibility of such excitonic modes is of interest for the pnictides , in this paper we focus on the generic quasiparticle features for raman scattering , and will consider excitonic peaks in a future publication . charge backflow and coulomb screening is explicitly included in all @xmath0 calculations , but pair interaction corrections will be neglected .",
    "we will however also consider the possibility that due to the form for the raman vertices , which are allowed when there are multiple fermi surfaces , there can also be backflow effects on symmetry channels other than @xmath0 in the fe - pnictides .",

    "raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of polarized light from a material . for a review see ref . .",
    "the cross section of the scattered light is proportional to the imaginary part of the channel - dependent raman susceptibility @xmath13 here we will take a simple frequency independent form for the raman vertices ( non - resonant scattering ) and write the effective raman charge fluctuations in the @xmath14-channel as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote band indices .",

    "generally , the vertex is determined by both density and current matrix elements between the conduction band and the excited states , and has not been calculated for even simple metals like al . however , the polarization geometries of the incoming and outgoing photons impose an overall symmetry due to the way in which excitations are created in directions determined by the electric field oscillations , and classifications of the anisotropy of the raman vertices can be employed .    in this paper , in order to focus on general features for raman scattering in the pnictides",
    ", we will neglect band structure features and treat all fermi surface sheets as circles .",

    "since an isotropic density fluctuation vanishes for @xmath21 , it can be shown via eq .",
    "[ eq : full ] that the @xmath0 contribution @xmath22 to the raman vertex is cancelled by charge backflow and does not contribute to the scattering cross - section .",

    ", we note that our choice of coordinates rests on the 1 fe unit cell , which is rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the 2 fe unit cell .",
    "thus our symmetry notation is electronic and not associated with the lattice principal directions , and therefore our classifications are 45 degrees rotated with respect to conventional lattice classifications .",
    "using lattice coordinates , what we call @xmath1 would be @xmath2 , and vice - versa . while this might create some confusion , it is convenient to understand the interplay of the angular dependence of the vertices and the energy gaps in the rotated 1 fe unit cell frame , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this should be kept in mind however when one discusses , e.g. , electronic excitations together with lattice excitations .",
    "then our symmetry labels @xmath1 and @xmath2 would have to be interchanged .",
    "other forms for the raman vertices are allowable , with the only requirement being that they must obey the transformation rules according to the relevant point group symmetries of the crystal .",
    "we note that for multi - sheeted fermi surfaces shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are different possible forms for the vertices other than eq . 9 . while the raman vertices of the @xmath8 sheets must transform according to eq .",
    "9 , for the @xmath10 sheets other forms for the vertices could be admissable .",
    "this includes , for the @xmath1 vertex for example , a vertex which is momentum independent on each @xmath10 sheet but of opposite sign . for the @xmath2 vertex , a raman vertex which is @xmath24-wave like on each @xmath10 sheet ( with a change of sign ) would also be admissable",

    "isotropic charge fluctuations are coupled across all unit cells , and raman scattering at low energies must vanish due to particle number conservation , leaving only an inelastic light scattering peak at the plasmon energy .",
    "screening by the long - range coulomb interaction can be taken into account by including couplings of the raman charge density @xmath33 to the isotropic density @xmath34 fluctuations and is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : full]-[eq8 ] ) constitute closed form expressions for the intraband , non - resonant contribution to the raman response .",
    "it is clear that the raman response is in general not simply additive with respect to the response calculated from each band separately .",
    "incident photons can create anisotropic charge fluctuations according to the direction of the polarization light vector , and those charge fluctuations relax by emitting a scattered photon and redistributing charge density via intrinsic electron scattering mechanisms such as electron - impurity , electron - phonon , electron - electron interactions , or via breaking of cooper pairs .",
    "the anisotropy of the charge fluctuations created with light can be controlled by aligning incident and scattered photon polarization vectors , transforming according to the elements of the irreducible point group of the crystal . for a material with @xmath38 tetragonal symmetry , and a single fermi sheet , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 raman responses are not coupled to the long - range coulomb interaction . as a consequence , the raman charge densities for these channels do not couple to the pure charge density channel , and the terms given in eq .",

    "we will see that this can also occur for the @xmath1 case for raman vertices which are allowed when one has multiple fermi surfaces as formed in the fe - pnictides .",
    "from the expression for the raman response we see that in the case of an isotropic gap , @xmath39 , there should always be a peak at @xmath40 . in an unconventional superconductor , depending on the polarization , this absorption peak is replaced by a peak or other structure at @xmath41 , twice the maximum of the gap over the fermi surface .",

    "furthermore , the existence of nodes in a gap creates low energy quasiparticles that cause a nonzero response for all frequencies .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to fully gapped superconductors whose response show a sharp gap edge with no low energy quasiparticles . in what follows we consider separate cases of increasing complexity in order to display what features for raman scattering in a multi - band system with different gap symmetries might be expected generically .         shown in fig .",

    "[ gaps_5band ] ) . ]    in order to understand the type of behavior found for the multiband models of the fe - pnictides , it is useful to begin with some special cases . early on , motivated by the proximity of the fe - pnictides to a @xmath44 spin density wave phase and the multiple fermi surface structure found in lda ( local density approximation ) calculations , a sign reversed @xmath11-wave gap was proposed.@xcite it was suggested that spin - fluctuation scattering of electron pairs between the @xmath8 and @xmath10 fermi sheets could lead to pairing with an isotropic @xmath11-wave gap @xmath45 that changed sign between the @xmath8 and @xmath10 fermi surfaces . in this case , the raman response would consist of a peak onsetting at @xmath46 or several peaks if there were gaps of different magnitudes on the various fermi surfaces . in the absence of impurity scattering and inelastic lifetime effects , this peak would vary as @xmath47 as @xmath48 approaches @xmath49 from above .    alternatively , rpa spin - fluctuation calculations and functional renormalization group studies find anisotropic @xmath11-wave gaps which can even have nodes on the @xmath10 fermi surfaces as well as nearby @xmath6-wave gaps with nodes on the @xmath8 fermi surfaces . here , in order to examine the raman signatures of such states , we consider the simple parameterization @xmath50 this gap is plotted as a function of angle around a circular fermi surface .",

    "<S> an important issue in the study of the iron - arsenic based superconductors is the symmetry of the superconducting gap , a problem complicated by multiple gaps on different fermi surface sheets . </S>",
    "<S> electronic raman scattering is a flexible bulk probe which allows one in principle to determine gap magnitudes and test for gap nodes in different regions of the brillouin zone by employing different photon polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> here we calculate the clean raman intensity for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 polarizations , and discuss the peak structures and low - energy power laws which might be expected for several popular models of the superconducting gap in these systems . </S>"
