    "noble liquid scintillators such as liquid xenon  @xcite , argon  @xcite , and neon  @xcite are expected to be excellent targets and detectors for direct dark matter detection experiments searching for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which may constitute the dark matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "these experiments measure scintillation light induced by low - energy nuclear recoils due to elastic scattering of wimps .",
    "absorption of nuclear recoil energy in noble liquid scintillators produces excitons and electron - ion pairs along the track .",
    "free excitons collide with ground states to form excited molecules ( excimers ) through @xmath1 where x stands for any type of noble liquid .",
    "free ions undergo collision , recombination and deexcitation processes , @xmath2 to form excimers .",
    "the excimers then decay radiatively from the lowest - excited molecular states @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the repulsive ground state @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known that noble liquid scintillators have reduced scintillation yield for low - energy nuclear recoils compared to electronic recoils  @xcite . only a fraction of the energy loss results in ionization and atomic excitation .",
    "moreover , high ionization density undermines recombination of electron - ion pairs and reduces scintillation light yield .",
    "the relative scintillation yield , defined as the ratio of the numbers of photons emitted from pure noble liquids in nuclear and electronic recoil events at the same energy , is a good measurement of the nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency , @xmath6 , determined by the visible deposited energy over the true recoil energy . in the case of electrons and @xmath7-rays ,",
    "almost all the energy loss by ionization is converted into scintillation light through electron - ion recombination , so the relative scintillation efficiency is assumed approximately equal to 1 in the absence of an electric field .",
    "but in the case of nuclear recoils , @xmath6 is much smaller than 1 and can vary as a function of nuclear recoil energy .",
    "the scintillation efficiency plays an important role in the direct detection of wimps . in the design of a new experiment ,",
    "the scintillation efficiency is related to the detection threshold and hence to the background level and ultimate sensitivity . in the interpretation of an experimental result ,",
    "the scintillation efficiency is crucial to the determination of wimp mass and wimp - nucleon cross section .",
    "the nuclear recoil scintillation efficiencies for liquid xenon , argon , and neon have been measured  @xcite using neutron sources . the detector is usually calibrated with well - known @xmath7-rays , such as 122 kev and 133 kev lines from a @xmath8co source . the relative scintillation efficiency for @xmath7-rays , @xmath9 , is defined as the visible energy divided by the incident @xmath7-ray energy , and is assumed to be 1 . as discussed later in this paper , this assumption is valid for electronic recoil energy above 20 kev in the noble liquids under investigation .",
    "the nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency is determined by the ratio of the nuclear recoil visible energy using the electron - equivalent energy calibration to the true recoil energy @xmath10 , @xmath11 .    the measurements are usually compared to either lindhard s theory  @xcite or hitachi s treatment  @xcite . it was found that lindhard s theory alone can not well explain the observed behavior in the data .",
    "the alternative explanation , hitachi s treatment , states that a biexcitonic quenching mechanism can occur before the free excitons self - trap when the excitation density is very high .",
    "this explanation can agree reasonably well with the xenon data  @xcite , but has not been applied to explain low - energy recoil data for neon or argon .",
    "moreover , there are other possible quenching processes that could contribute to the reduction of scintillation efficiency for low - energy nuclear recoils .",
    "these include collisions ( via the penning process  @xcite ) between two excited molecular states ( excimers ) to form one excited state and one ground state  @xcite , and supereleastic collisions that quench the singlet states to triplet states  @xcite .    a more universal description of the reduced scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils is preferred for all noble liquid scintillators . since the proposed quenching mechanisms are all dependent on the density of the ionization and excitation track left by the recoiling nucleus , it is possible to form a combined model of these mechanisms without incorporating details of the relative contributions of the different mechanisms .",
    "birk s saturation law for organic scintillators  @xcite provides a convenient description of the dependence of scintillation quenching on ionization density . in this study",
    ", we apply birk s law to noble liquids , offering a conventional way to determine the total scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils by measuring birk s constant ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the luminescence intensity in the noble gas scintillator depends solely on the energy density and is independent of the kind of the particle  @xcite .",
    "this is to say that a measurement of @xmath0 for noble liquids will allow understanding of the relative scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils induced by neutrons , alphas , and other heavy isotopes .",
    "this is a very valuable way to determine the scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils induced by all types of particles in noble liquid scintillators .",
    "furthermore , this method allows determination of the relative scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils in noble liquids by measuring the constant @xmath0 with @xmath7-rays .",
    "this is a much easier measurement compared to the nuclear recoil measurements with neutron and alpha sources .    in this paper , we propose a model to combine lindhard s theory and birk s saturation law to describe the reduction in scintillation efficiency observed in noble liquid scintillators .",
    "we describe these two reduction mechanisms in section  [ sec : quen1 ] and  [ sec : quen2 ] , respectively . the model combining these two reduction mechanisms",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : com ] and its predictions are compared to experimental data in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the scintillation efficiency ( @xmath9 as a function of recoil energy ) for very low - energy electrons and @xmath7-rays is discussed briefly in section  [ sec : ele ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "when a neutron or wimp scatters elastically off a noble liquid atomic nucleus , the recoiling nucleus then loses its energy by colliding with electrons and nuclei within the detector .",
    "this nuclear recoil process involves the competition between , on the one hand , energy transfer to atomic electrons and , on the other hand , energy transfer to translational motion of atoms",
    ". the total rate at which the recoiling nucleus loses energy with respect to distance ( @xmath12 ) is dependent on the medium through which it travels , and is also called the stopping power . at low energies ,",
    "the total stopping power of the noble liquid atom consists of electronic and nuclear stopping power .",
    "the electronic stopping power is the amount of energy per unit distance that the recoiling nucleus loses due to electronic excitation and ionization of the surrounding noble liquid atoms .",
    "the nuclear stopping power is the energy loss per unit length due to atomic collisions that contribute to the kinetic energy ( thermal motion ) of the noble liquid atoms , but that do not result in internal excitation of atoms .",
    "the proportion of electronic to nuclear stopping power depends on the recoil energy of the nucleus .",
    "if the recoil energy were very large , the nuclear stopping power would be very small compared to the electronic stopping power .",
    "however , in the energy range of wimp - nucleus elastic scatterings , the nuclear stopping power plays a significant role in the energy loss of the recoiling noble liquid nucleus .",
    "j. lindhard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed in detail the theory of energy loss of low - energy nuclei .",
    "supposing that the recoiling nucleus loses all of its energy in the detector , the total energy loss can be expressed in terms of the losses due to the electronic stopping power @xmath13 and nuclear stopping power @xmath14 as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are both functions of recoil energy @xmath16 .",
    "as only the portion of the energy lost in electronic excitation or ionization will result in the creation of excitons and electron - ion pairs in the noble liquids , the fraction defines an ionization energy reduction factor ( @xmath17 ) due to losses to the nuclear stopping power @xmath18 as the total stopping power is @xmath19 @xmath20 can then be determined by the ratio of two integrals @xmath21 to present @xmath22 as a function of recoil energy , the integrals above should be evaluated for each possible recoil energy .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite represents @xmath17 as @xmath23 where , for a nucleus of atomic number @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( kev ) @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is well fitted by : @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig : lindfirst ] shows this ionization energy reduction factor for noble liquids from lindhard s theory .",
    "the passage of a particle in a noble liquid produces a structured track along its path that is conveniently described in terms of a core and a penumbra  @xcite .",
    "the penumbra that surrounds the core is a low ionization density zone .",
    "the core is expected to be a high ionization density zone , so ionization density dependent quenching caused by biexcitonic collisions or the penning process is likely to occur there . on the one hand , the free excitons can be self - trapped to form excimers , for example , ar@xmath30 , that then fluoresce to the lowest states . on the other hand , the free excitons can diffuse and undergo biexcitonic quenching , or the excimers can further collide with each other via the penning process , with a probability of occurrence that depends on the density of free excitons produced , which is proportional to ionization density .",
    "therefore , the biexcitonic collisions and the penning process act as quenching agents for the excitons produced by the ionization along the track . it is well known that the number of excitons and electron - ion pairs produced per unit path length is proportional to the electronic energy loss @xmath12  @xcite , with a proportionality constant that will be designated as @xmath31",
    "the local concentration of the core is also proportional to the ionization density , and is given by @xmath32@xmath12 .",
    "the overall collision probability in the core is given by @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the specific fluorescence can be expressed by @xmath34 eq .",
    "[ eq : birk0 ] is called birk s saturation law  @xcite , which describes the relative scintillation response of scintillators to an ionizing particle of any energy . the values of @xmath31 and @xmath0 can be determined experimentally .    according to eq .",
    "[ eq : birk0 ] , the scintillation photon yield is reduced at high ionization density .",
    "thus , we define a quenching factor @xmath35 which is related to the electronic stopping power @xmath12 induced by nuclear recoils .      for ions heavier than protons , the electronic stopping power in a given material can be calculated from the stopping power in the same material based on the `` heavy ion scaling rule '' , @xmath36    where the stopping power @xmath37 for protons is determined at the same velocity as the stopping power @xmath38 for heavy ions .",
    "@xmath39 is the ` effective charge ' for ions of atomic number @xmath40 .",
    "effective ion charges will result from the stripping of bound electrons from the ion when moving through a medium .",
    "thus , the effective charge fraction @xmath41 is expected to be related to the relative velocity , @xmath42 , between the ion velocity @xmath43 and the velocity of the valence electrons in the medium .",
    "when the valence electron gas of the medium is characterized by the effective number of electrons that participate in plasma excitations , the velocity of the valence electrons can be characterized by the fermi velocity @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the electron density and @xmath46 the electron mass .",
    "@xmath42 is proposed in  @xcite to be @xmath47    a formula for the effective charge fraction @xmath41 has been deduced by brand and kitagawa  @xcite as a good approximation in the region where stopping power is proportional to the velocity @xmath43 : @xmath48 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the bohr velocity and radius , respectively .",
    "@xmath51 denotes the degree of ionization , which was calculated by applying a velocity - stripping criterion to the thomas - fermi model  @xcite of the neutral atom and is tabulated as a function of the reduced variable @xmath52 in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative energy stripping criterion was proposed by mathar and posselt ( mp )  @xcite to explain the dependence of the ionization fraction on the ion velocity and to yield better results especially for higher ion velocities . using the energy definition of the brandt - kitagawa ( bk ) model ,",
    "@xmath51 is determined by solving numerically the following equation @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the screening radius @xmath56 , which is used to parameterize the charge density profile of the projectile ion , is determined by minimizing the total energy of the bound electrons in bk to be @xmath57}.\\ ] ]    ziegler , biersack and littmark ( zbl )  @xcite modified the ion size parameter @xmath56 to include a tabulated factor individual to @xmath58 .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath51 is then parameterized as a universal fitting function of @xmath59 as @xmath60    the ionization fractions from the three different approaches described above are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_y ] as a function of the variables @xmath61 or @xmath59 . in this paper , we adopt the bk formalism to calculate the effective charge of ions and the electronic stopping power values , but the alternative approaches are used to estimate the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we can utilize eq.[eq : s_a ] and the effective ion charge to calculate the electronic stopping power , provided that the stopping power values for protons in the same material are known .",
    "a table of stopping powers and ranges for protons and alpha particles has been produced by a committee of the international commission on radiological units and measurements ( icru )  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we retrieve the proton stopping powers from the pstar database  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : pstoppingar ] shows the electronic stopping power for proton projectiles in ar target as a function of the proton velocity @xmath62 . according to lindhard and scharff  @xcite ,",

    "this is illustrated by a proportional function ( red thick line ) fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstoppingar ] .",

    "paul and schinner ( ps )  @xcite performed a systematic comparison of a large collection of stopping power data for projectiles from @xmath63li to @xmath64ar to those for alpha particles in the same materials .",

    "there are two cases : 1 ) free excitons form excimers through a self - trapping process  @xcite , and 2 ) the ions are localized through the formation of excited molecular ions and eventually form excimers through recombination , deexcitation , and collision .",
    "the origins of the luminescence for both cases are attributed  @xcite to low excited molecular states , namely , @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the fraction of excitons that undergo self - trapping depends largely on ionization density .",
    "the fraction of ions that combine with ground states to form excited molecular ions is proportional to ionization density .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of excimers relaxing to the lowest - excited states is also a function of ionization density .",
    "this is to say that some of the excitons or ions can collide each other without going to excimers and some of the formed excimers can further undergo the penning process to reduce the number of radiative lowest - excited states . this part of excitons , ions , and the formed excimers is quenched .",

    "fig : argon2 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : neon2 ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : xenon2 ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the experimental data can not be explained by lindhard s theory alone , but can be well described when the birk s saturation effect has been taken into account .",
    "note that the scintillation efficiencies for 5.035 mev @xmath75 particles and 33.5 mev / amu @xmath64o ions in liquid argon were measured to be 71% and 59%  @xcite , which agree very well with our model prediction , 72% and 63% .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , although the theoretical uncertainties of electronic stopping power values at very low recoil energy are considerable , the effect on the uncertainties of the final quenching factor are not large as the birk s constants @xmath0 are quite small .",
    "for example , by assuming a factor of two difference in the electronic stopping powers at 1 kev in liquid argon , the contribution to the uncertainty of the quenching factor is less than 7% .",
    "thus , the dominant uncertainties come from the uncertainties in the lindhard theory at very low energy . however , it is usually believed that the lindhard theory describes experimental data well  @xcite , although the experimental uncertainties are quite large at low energy .",
    "noble liquids response to low - energy electrons and @xmath7-rays is usually assumed to be linear for the existing experiments  @xcite . to investigate whether such an assumption holds",
    ", we also calculate and show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ele1 ] the quenching factor for electronic recoils in liquid argon , neon and xenon utilizing the @xmath0 constants determined above .",
    "it is clear that the assumption holds quite well down to 20 kev because of the small stopping power values ( a few mev @xmath72/g ) above 20 kev .",
    "however , the quenching effect is expected to be significant when the electronic recoil energy is below 20 kev due to the larger stopping power ( more than 10 mev @xmath72/g ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0 constants are determined by birk s law in which the relative scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils is used , under the assumption that the electronic recoil quenching factor is 1 . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ele1 ] , this assumption is only valid above 20 kev .",
    "in summary , we found that the reduced scintillation response to low - energy nuclear recoils comes from two different mechanisms : 1 ) reduced ionization and excitation energy by nuclear collisions and 2 ) reduced scintillation photon yield due to high ionization and excitation density induced by nuclear recoils .",
    "the former is well described by lindhard s theory and the latter is attributed to biexcitonic collisions between excitons and the penning process between excimers .",
    "the scintillation quenching induced by the combination of biexcitonic collisions and the penning process can be described by birk s law .",
    "we have combined these two reduction mechanisms to describe the total scintillation efficiency for noble liquids .",
    "the calculations are compared to available data and it is found that they are in good agreement within experimental uncertainties .",
    "we have also studied the scintillation response of noble liquid scintillators to low - energy electrons and @xmath7-rays and found that the response is not linear at recoil energy below 20 kev .",
    "this paper provides a conventional way to measure the total scintillation efficiency of noble liquids for all types of particles including neutron - induced nuclear recoils , alpha particles and other heavier elements by measuring birk s constant @xmath0 using @xmath7-ray sources .",

    "<S> scintillation efficiency of low - energy nuclear recoils in noble liquids plays a crucial role in interpreting results from some direct searches for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cause of a reduced scintillation efficiency relative to electronic recoils in noble liquids remains unclear at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute such a reduction of scintillation efficiency to two major mechanisms : 1 ) energy loss and 2 ) scintillation quenching . </S>",
    "<S> the former is commonly described by lindhard s theory and the latter by birk s saturation law . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to combine these two to explain the observed reduction of scintillation yield for nuclear recoils in noble liquids . </S>",
