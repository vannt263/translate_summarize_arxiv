    "the dramatic increase in mobile applications and the number of devices demanding for wireless connectivity poses a challenge in today s wireless networks @xcite , and calls for new networking mechanisms .",
    "one of the promising solutions to address the increasing data and connectivity demand is device - to - device ( d2d ) networking . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_example_new](a ) , the default operation in current wireless networks is to connect each device to the internet via its cellular or wi - fi interface . the d2d connectivity idea , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_example_new](b ) , breaks this assumption : it advocates that two or more devices in close proximity can be directly connected , _",
    "i.e. , _ without traversing through auxiliary devices such as a base station or access point .",
    "d2d networking , that can be formed by exploiting d2d connections such as wi - fi direct @xcite , is a promising solution to the ever increasing number and diversity of applications and devices . in this context",
    ", it is crucial to identify scarce resources and effectively utilize them to fully exploit the potential of d2d networking .",
    "although bandwidth is traditionally considered as the primary scarce resource in wireless networks , in d2d networks , thanks to close proximity among devices and the developments in communication theory , the main bottleneck shifts from bandwidth to other scarce resources including processing power and energy .",
    "next , we present our pilot study demonstrating that processing power can be more pronounced as a bottleneck than bandwidth in d2d networks .    [",
    "fig : intro_example_new ]    we developed a prototype for this pilot study as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexityvsrate_new](a ) , where a mobile device @xmath0 receives data from another device @xmath1 over a wi - fi direct link .",
    "we use android operating system @xcite based nexus 7 tablets @xcite as mobile devices . in this experiment , after receiving the packets , the mobile device @xmath0 performs operations with complexities of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 above the transport layer ( tcp ) , where @xmath5 is the packet size , and the operations we perform are counting the bytes in the packets .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 correspond to ( i ) no counting , ( ii ) counting every byte in a packet once , and ( iii ) counting every byte in a packet @xmath5 times , respectively .",
    "we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexityvsrate_new](c ) the received rate at the mobile device @xmath0 ( note that this is the rate we measure at the mobile device @xmath0 after performing computations ) versus time .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the received rate decreases significantly when the complexity increases .",
    "our pilot study shows that even if actual bandwidth is high and not a bottleneck , processing power could become a bottleneck in d2d networks .",
    "similar observations are made for the energy bottleneck as detailed in appendix a. furthermore , with the advances in communication theory , _",
    "millimeter wave communication @xcite , it is expected that data rates among devices in close proximity will increase significantly , which will make processing power and energy more pronounced as bottlenecks .",
    "however , existing applications , algorithms , and protocols are mainly designed by assuming that bandwidth is the main bottleneck .",
    "thus , it is crucial to develop new networking mechanisms when bandwidth is not the primary bottleneck , but processing power and energy are .",
    "[ fig : complexityvsrate_new ]    thus , in this paper , our goal is to create group of devices that help each other cooperatively by exploiting high rate d2d connections to overcome the processing power and energy bottlenecks .",
    "the next example demonstrates our approach .",
    "[ ex1 ] let us consider fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_example_new](a ) again , where device @xmath1 would like to receive a file from a remote resource via using its cellular or wi - fi connection .",
    "assume that the cellular ( or wi - fi ) rates of all devices are 1mbps , but device @xmath1 can receive data with 500kbps rate due to processing power bottleneck , _",
    "device @xmath1 has limited processing power ( similar to our pilot study we presented earlier ) . in a traditional system",
    ", @xmath1 will behave as a single end point , so its receiving rate will be limited to 500kbps . on the other hand ,",
    "if devices @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath7 will behave as a group and cooperate , then devices @xmath0 and @xmath7 can also receive and process 500kbps portions of data , and transmit the processed data to device @xmath1 over d2d connections .",
    "this increases the receiving rate of device @xmath1 to 1.5mbps from 500kbps , which is a significant improvement .",
    "this example could be extended for scenarios when energy ( battery of mobile devices ) is limited .",
    "for example , if device @xmath0 s battery level is too low , its participation to the group activity should be limited .",
    "@xmath6    the scenario in the above motivating example could arise in different practical applications from health , education , entertainment , and transportation systems .",
    "the following are some example applications .",
    "_ health : _ a person may own a number of health monitoring devices ( activity monitoring , hearth monitoring , etc . ) which may need updates from the core network . these updates - potentially coded for error correction , compression , and security reasons - should be processed ( decoded ) by these devices .",
    "processing takes time , which may lead to late reaction to the update ( which may require timely response ) and energy consumption . on the other hand , by grouping mobile devices , the person s smartphone or tablet could receive the update , process , and pass the processed data to the health monitoring devices via high rate d2d links .",
    "_ education & entertainment : _ a group of students may want to watch the video of a lecture from an online education system ( or an entertainment video ) while sitting together and using several mobile devices . in this setup , one of the devices can download a base layer of a video and decode , while the other devices could download enhancement layers and decode .",
    "the decoded video layers could be exchanged among these mobile devices via high rate d2d links . as in the motivating example , if one device s download and decoding rate is limited to 500kbps , it could be improved to 1.5mbps with the help of other devices .",
    "note that the processing overhead in these applications could be due to any computationally intensive task related to data transmission .",
    "for example , for video transmission applications , h.264/avc decoders introduce higher computational complexity when higher quality guarantees are needed @xcite .",
    "another example could be network coding ; for example , data could be network coded at the source to improve throughput , error correction , packet randomization potential of network coding @xcite .",
    "however , most of the network coding schemes introduce high computational complexity at the receiver side ; @xmath8 , @xcite , which limits the transmission rate .",
    "encryption could be another example that introduces processing overhead @xcite .",
    "thus , there exists several applications and scenarios where bandwidth and energy could be bottlenecks , while bandwidth is not the bottleneck .",
    "this makes our approach demonstrated in example  [ ex1 ] crucial .",
    "in particular , in this paper , we develop an _ energy - aware cooperative computation _ framework for mobile devices . in this setup , a group of cooperative mobile devices , within proximity of each other , ( i ) use their cellular or wi - fi ( 802.11 ) links as their primary networking interfaces , and ( ii ) exploit their d2d connections ( wi - fi direct ) for cooperative computation .",
    "our approach is grounded on a network utility maximization ( num ) formulation of the problem and its solution @xcite .",
    "the solution decomposes into several parts with an intuitive interpretation , such as flow control , computation control , energy control , and cooperation & scheduling .",
    "based on the structure of the decomposed solution , we develop a stochastic algorithm ; _ energy - aware cooperative computation_. the following are the key contributions of this work :    * we consider a group of cooperative mobile devices within proximity of each other . in this scenario ,",
    "we first investigate the impact of processing power to transmission rate .",
    "then , we develop an energy - aware cooperative computation model , where devices depending on their energy constraints could cooperate to get benefit of aggregate processing power in a group of cooperative devices .",
    "* we characterize our problem in a num framework by taking into account processing power , energy , and bandwidth constraints .",
    "we solve the num problem , and use the solution to develop our stochastic algorithm ; _ energy - aware cooperative computation ( eacc)_. we show that eacc provides stability and optimality guarantees . * an integral part of our work is to understand the performance of eacc in practice . towards this goal",
    ", we develop a testbed consisting of nexus 5 smartphones and nexus 7 tablets .",
    "all devices uses android 5.1.1 as their operation systems .",
    "we implement _ eacc _ in this testbed , and evaluate it .",
    "the experimental results show that our algorithm brings significant performance benefits .",

    "this work combines ideas from d2d networking , network utility maximization , and stochastic network control .",
    "the idea of d2d networking is very promising to efficiently utilize resources , so it has found several applications in the literature . in particular ,",
    "d2d connections are often used to form cooperative groups for data streaming applications , and for the purpose of ( i ) content dissemination among mobile devices @xcite , ( ii ) cooperative video streaming over mobile devices @xcite , and ( iii ) creating multiple paths and providing better connectivity by using multiple interfaces simultaneously @xcite . as compared to this line of work",
    ", we investigate the impact of processing power and energy in d2d networks , and develop mechanisms to effectively utilize these scarce resources .",
    "d2d networking is often used for the purpose of offloading cellular networks .",
    "for example , previous work @xcite disseminate the content to mobile devices by taking advantage of d2d connections to relive the load on cellular networks . instead of offloading cellular networks ,",
    "our goal is to create energy - aware cooperation framework to overcome the processing power and energy bottlenecks of mobile devices .",
    "there is an increasing interest in computing using mobile devices by exploiting connectivity among mobile devices @xcite .",
    "this approach suggests that if devices in close proximity are capable of processing tasks cooperatively , then these devices could be used together to process a task as it is a cheaper alternative to remote clouds .",
    "this approach , sparking a lot of interest , led to some very interesting work in the area @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as compared to this line of work , we focus on processing power and energy bottlenecks in mobile devices and address the problem by developing energy - aware cooperative computation mechanism .",
    "an integral part of our proposed work in this task is to develop efficient resource allocation mechanisms . in that sense ,",
    "our approach is similar to the line of work emerged after the pioneering work in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , our focus is on energy - aware cooperative computation .",

    "this kind of abstraction helps us focus on the bottlenecks of the system ; processing power , energy of mobile devices , and downlink / uplink data rates . in this setup ,",
    "mobile devices communicate via d2d connections such as wi - fi direct , while the source communicates with mobile devices via cellular or wi - fi links .",
    "we consider in our analysis that time is slotted and @xmath11 refers to the beginning of slot @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ]    * connecting devices together : * the total flow rate towards device @xmath5 in fig .",

    "the flow rate @xmath16 is coupled with a utility function @xmath22 , which we assume to be strictly concave function of @xmath16 .",
    "this requirement is necessary to ensure stability and utility optimality of our algorithms .",
    "the ultimate goal in our resource allocation problem is to determine the flow rates ; @xmath16 which maximize the sum utility @xmath23 .",

    "when data is arriving from a d2d interface , it is directly passed to the application layer , as this data is already processed by another device . on the other hand , when data is arriving from the source via cellular or wifi interfaces , packets go through multiple queues as shown in fig .",

    "finally , packets from @xmath35 are transmitted to application if device @xmath5 is the destination of the data ( _ i.e. , _",

    "if packets in @xmath26 increases too much , this means that the computation block , hence processing power , is the bottleneck , so node @xmath5 should not receive much packets from the source .",
    "similarly , if @xmath27 increases too much , this means that energy filter is the bottleneck , so again node @xmath5 should not receive much packets . note that there could be also some buildup in @xmath28 if the link between node @xmath5 and @xmath15 is the bottleneck of the system , and it should be taken into account when the energy - aware cooperative computation framework is developed .    also , it is crucial in our system model to put energy filter after the computation block , because if device @xmath5 will help device @xmath15 , the actual amount of packets that are supposed to be transmitted are the processed packets , which will cause energy consumption ( _ i.e. , _ not the packets before processing ) .",

    "the computation under consideration in this experiment is @xmath127 , which basically counts the number of bytes in a packet @xmath5 times , @xmath5 is the packet size . as can be seen ,",
    "if there is no cooperation , the rate measured at @xmath125 is on the order of 1.5mbps . on the other hand , eacc increases the rate to almost 3mbps .",

    ", eacc doubles the rate as compared to no - cooperation , which is a significant improvement .    for the same setup in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_time_results](a ) , we also evaluate the effect of energy control part of eacc on the average rate performance .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_time_results](c ) shows the average rate versus battery level at the receiver device @xmath125 . in these results",
    ", we used android based nexus 5 smartphones .",
    "the average rate is calculated as the average over 10 trials ( with different seeds ) .",
    "the computation under consideration in this experiment is @xmath127 , which basically counts the number of bytes in a packet for each byte in the packet .",
    "we consider that if the battery level of a device reduces below 40% threshold , then energy credits are not generated for the processing of the received packets .",
    "this makes @xmath27 large over time , and after some point no packets are transmitted to that device for the processing task . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_time_results](c ) , when the battery level of @xmath125 reduces below 40% , then it stops receiving packets for processing .",
    "if there is no cooperation , then the rate towards @xmath125 reduces to 0 . on the other hand , with eacc ,",
    "the rate is still higher than 0 thanks to having helper .",
    "the helper device with larger energy level ( for the sake of this experiment ) , receives packets from the source , process them , and forwards them to @xmath125 , which receives already processed data .",
    "after 40% threshold , both eacc and no - cooperation improve , because @xmath125 starts processing packets .",
    "this result shows the importance of energy - awareness in our cooperative computation setup .",
    "now , we consider the effect of the number of helpers to overall rate performance . in particular , we develop a setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_one_receiver_results](a ) , where there is one source , one receiver , and varying number of helpers . in this setup , the source device , receiver , and the first two helper devices",

    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_one_receiver_results](b ) shows the average rate ( averaged over 10 seeds ) when eacc is employed versus the number of helpers for different computational complexities such as @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath127 , where the processing task is counting the number of bytes in a packet .",
    "as expected , when complexity increases , the rate decreases .",
    "more interestingly , the increasing number of helpers increases the rates of all complexity levels .",
    "there are two reasons for this behavior .",
    "first , even if complexity level is low , _ e.g. , _ @xmath128 ,",
    "processing power is still a bottleneck , and it can be solved by increasing the number of helpers . note that after the number of helpers exceeds a value , the achievable rates saturate , which means that processing power is not a bottleneck anymore , but bandwidth is .",
    "the second reason is that receiving data over multiple interfaces increases diversity . in other words ,",
    "when the channel condition over one interface ( _ e.g. , _ between source and the mobile device ) degrades , the other interface ( _ e.g. , _ between two mobile devices ) can still have a better channel condition .    in order to understand the real impact of processing power in a cooperative system , we tested both eacc and cooperation ( without computation and energy control ) in the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_one_receiver_results](a ) .",
    "the results are provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_one_receiver_results](c ) when the complexity is @xmath127 . as can be seen , while eacc significantly increases the rate with increasing number of helpers , cooperation slightly increases the rate ( due to diversity ) .",
    "the improvement of eacc over cooperation is as high as 83% , which is significant .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_two_receiver_results ]    finally , we consider a scenario that there are multiple receivers interested in different files .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_two_receiver_results](a ) shows the system model with one source , two receivers , and multiple helpers . in this setup ,",
    "the source , two receivers , and the first helper is android based nexus 5 smartphone , while the rest of the helpers are nexus 7 tablets .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_helpers_two_receiver_results](b ) and ( c ) show the average rate ( averaged over 10 seeds ) measured at @xmath125 and @xmath130 when eacc is employed with respect to the increasing number of helpers , respectively .",
    "similar to previous setups , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath127 correspond to different computational complexities , where the processing task is counting the number of bytes in a packet . as can be seen , the measured rate at both @xmath125 and @xmath130 increases with increasing number of helpers .",
    "this shows that our eacc algorithm successfully accommodates multiple flows and receivers .",
    "we considered that a group of cooperative mobile devices , within proximity of each other , ( i ) use their cellular or wi - fi ( 802.11 ) links as their primary networking interfaces , and ( ii ) exploit their d2d connections ( wi - fi direct ) for cooperative computation .",
    "we showed that if mobile devices cooperate to utilize their aggregate processing power , it significantly improves transmission rates .",
    "thus , for this scenario , we developed an _ energy - aware cooperative computation _ framework to effectively utilize processing power and energy .",
    "this framework provides a set of algorithms including flow , computation and energy controls as well as cooperation and scheduling .",
    "we implemented these algorithms in a testbed which consists of real mobile devices .",
