    "at least two effects arise , the first being thermoelastic damping : because of the oscillatory bending , the beam is compressed and stretched at opposite sides . since such volume changes are accompanied by work , the local temperature in the beam will deviate from the mean . for large aspect ratios as in our case",

    "consequently , one would expect the energy loss to be proportional to the oscillation frequency , in contrast to the assumption of a frequency independent @xmath36 and our experimental findings .",
    "another local phonon - based damping effect is the akhiezer - effect@xcite ; it is a consequence of the fact that phonon frequencies are modulated by strain , parameterized by the grneisen tensor .",
    "if different phonon modes ( characterized by their wave vector and phonon branch ) are affected differently , the occupancy of each mode corresponds to a different temperature .",

    "<S> in contrast , a mechanism with discrete relaxation rates will exhibit damping maxima whenever the oscillation frequency matches the relaxation rate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further notice that in our experiments beams with larger widths exhibit slightly higher quality factors . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates an increased defect density near the surface being either intrinsic or caused by the micro - fabrication@xcite ( rie etch ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a fixed cross - section however , the applicability of our model is not affected .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we systematically studied the transverse mode frequencies and quality factors of prestressed sin nanoscale beams . </S>",
    "<S> implementing continuum theory , we reproduce the measured frequencies varying with beam length and mode index over an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that damping is caused by local strain variations induced by the oscillation , independent of frequency , enables us to calculate the observed quality factors with a single interaction strength as free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify the unusually high quality factors of pre - stressed beams as being primarily caused by the increased elastic energy rather than a decrease in damping rate . </S>",
    "<S> several possible damping mechanisms are discussed ; because of the observed nearly frequency - independence of the damping parameter @xmath36 , we attribute the mechanism to interaction of the strain with local defects of not yet identified origin . </S>",
