    "the physics of magnetic superconductors is very interesting subject due to the pronounced competition of magnetic order and singlet superconductivity in bulk materials .",
    "the question of their coexistence was first rised theoretically in the pioneering work by v. l. ginzburg @xcite in 1956 , where only the",
    "_ electromagnetic ( em ) interaction _ between magnetic moments and superconductivity was considered . however , the breakthrough in the physics of ms came with experiments after the discovery of _ ternary rare earth _ ( @xmath8 ) compounds such as borides @xmath9 with transition elements @xmath10 , chalcogenides @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , silicides @xmath13si@xmath14 and stannides @xmath15 @xcite . in most of them",
    "type - ii superconductivity is realized and in all of them are the localized re magnetic moments _ regularly _ _ distributed _ in the crystal lattice .",
    "the basic crystallographic structure , for instance in rerh@xmath16b@xmath16 , contains localized moments ( lms ) which are rather far a way from the rh and b blocks which deliver conduction electrons . due to this spatial separation",
    "the conduction electrons jump rarely on magnetic ions making the direct exchange interaction ( ex ) @xmath17 @xmath18 much smaller than in transition metallic magnets . in these systems",
    "the 4f rare - earth shells are responsible for localized moments in which the f - level lies much below the fermi energy , @xmath19 . a number of compounds belonging to the above families have shown coexistence of superconductivity with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order - _ antiferromagnetic superconductors _ ( afs ) , such as @xmath20 ( re = dy , sm , ... ) , and in most of them the neel ( af ) transition temperature @xmath21 is smaller than the superconducting one @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .    however , a lot of research , both experimental and theoretical , starting from the late seventies were devoted to ms systems in which ferromagnetic ( f ) order and singlet sc compete due to their strong antagonistic characters - we call these systems _ ferromagnetic superconductors _ ( @xmath24 ) and they are the main subject of this review .",
    "it turned out that the modified f and sc , order can under certain conditions coexist since the f order is transformed ( in the presence of superconductivity ) into a spiral or domain - like structure - depending on the type and strength of magnetic anisotropy in the system @xcite , @xcite . in the re ternary compounds this competition is rather strong and",
    "therefore these two orderings coexist in a limited temperature interval @xmath25 ( the reentrant behavior ) , for instance in errh@xmath16b@xmath16 and homo@xmath26s@xmath27 .",
    "the coexistence region in errh@xmath16b@xmath16 is narrow with @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath29 and @xmath31 @xmath29 , while for homo@xmath26s@xmath32 it is even narrower with @xmath33 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath29 and @xmath34 @xmath29 - see refs .",

    "a new and very interesting research field in the physics of ferromagnetic superconductors was opened in 1997 by pobell s group in bayreuth pobell , which discovered the coexistence of _ superconductivity and nuclear magnetic order _ in the type - i superconductor @xmath3 with @xmath38 @xmath29 and @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "although there is a tendency to the nuclear ferromagnetic order , superconducting electrons enforce the appearance of a spiral or domain - like nuclear magnetic ordering in the sc state  below @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that not only bulk properties of fs are exotic , but also josephson junctions made of bulk ms with spiral ordering show potentially fascinating properties , such as @xmath6-contact @xcite , combination of a magnetic analog of the josephson effect for spin current with the ordinary josephson effect for charge current @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall discuss mainly the _ microscopic and macroscopic theory of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic superconductors _ which takes into account the most relevant interactions between localized moments and conduction electrons - the _ exchange _ ( ex ) and _ electromagnetic _ ( em ) interaction .",
    "this theory was elaborated by buzdin , bulaevskii , panyukov and present author - see @xcite and references therein , and successfully applied to a number of systems . due to the lack of space",
    "we shall discuss effects of magnetic field on magnetic superconductors briefly - for this  subject we refer the reader to ref.bubukupaadvances .",
    "we would like to point out here that in the last several years there was a huge activity in studying of hybrid heterogeneous magnetic superconductors such as s - f multilayers and s - f - s josephson junctions .",
    "this field is not only of importance for the fundamental solid state physics but it is of enormous interest for applications in spintronics and quantum computing , especially after the experimental confirmation of the remarkable prediction of the @xmath6-josephson contact by alexander buzdin and coworkers buzdin - pi - shift , @xcite .",
    "this exciting field will be covered elsewhere in this issue , as well as the physics of other magnetic superconductors - heavy fermions , borocarbides @xmath42 , cuprates rusr@xmath43gdcu@xmath43o@xmath27 , ferromagnets with triplet sc such as uge@xmath43 .",
    "here we shall be limited to those magnetic superconductors where the magnetic ordering of the _ localized 4f moments _ ( lm )  is due to the indirect exchange interaction ( rkky ) going via the conduction electrons .",
