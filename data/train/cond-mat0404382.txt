    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 @xcite triggered a major theoretical and experimental effort to understand its mechanisms .",
    "et al . _ @xcite predicted that that mgb@xmath0 should have two metallic bands at the fermi energy , one two dimensional ( @xmath2 ) band along the @xmath3@xmath4 direction and another three dimensional ( @xmath5 ) band covering most of the brillouin zone volume .",
    "they also predicted that both bands should undergo the superconducting transition with different energy gaps , the higher being in the @xmath2 band .",
    "several experimental studies have found evidence for a double gap in mgb@xmath0 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "stm data @xcite showed that these two gaps close at the same @xmath6 . the first attempt to describe a two band superconductor",
    "was done as early as 1959 @xcite , when suhl _",
    "proposed that when two superconducting bands interact the critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) of the lowest gap band increases and joins the one of the higest gap band .",
    "this is qualitatively the effect observed in stm measurements .",
    "most of the physics behind superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 is now understood @xcite and the remaining big question concerns the process responsible for connecting the two bands .    in this work",
    "we address this issue by looking at the far - infrared equilibrium and photo - induced reflectivity of a mgb@xmath0 thin film and at the electron spin resonance ( esr ) of powder samples .",
    "optical data was taken on a @xmath7 nm thick c - axis oriented film of mgb@xmath0 deposited on a sapphire substrate at postech @xcite .",
    "its @xmath6 of 30 k is suppressed compared to the bulk material ( @xmath6 = 39 k ) .",
    "standard reflectance measurements were performed using the bruker 66v ftir spectrometer at beamline u10a of the nsls , with synchrotron radiation as the ir source .",
    "the specimen was solidly clamped with indium gaskets to the copper cold - finger of a heli - tran cryostat , leaving a 3 mm diameter aperture exposed for the ir measurement .",
    "the remaining 80% of the sample s surface was available for thermal conduction into the cold finger .",
    "transient far - infrared photo - reflectance measurements were also performed using the same spectrometer and beamline . here , we measured the reflectance change due to illuminating the mgb@xmath0 film with 2 ps near - infrared ( @xmath8 nm ) pulses from a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the laser pulses break pairs and weaken the superconducting state for a brief amount of time ( @xmath9 ns ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting change in reflectance is sensed with the @xmath9 ns infrared pulses from the synchrotron in a pump - probe configuration @xcite .",
    "the average laser power was 20 to 50 mw ( 0.4 to 1 nj per pulse ) so that the mgb@xmath0 film could be maintained at @xmath10 k. the pulse repetition frequency was 53 mhz , matching the pulsed ir output from the synchrotron . for time - dependent studies ,",
    "the broadband probe pulses were not spectrally resolved , and the response is an average of the reflectance across the 10 to 100 @xmath11 spectral range .",
    "esr data was collected between 40 k and 600 k with a bruker esp300e 10  ghz spectrometer equiped with an oxford esr he cryostat on mgb@xmath0 powder samples synthesized in princeton .",
    "the powder was mechanically ground to avoid skin depth problems .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the ratio of superconducting to normal far - infrared reflectance at equilibrium . the dashed line is a mattis - bardeen fit @xcite assuming a gap at 43 @xmath11 .",
    "the solid line is obtained using a simple non - interacting carrier model for the conductivity @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are mattis - bardeen conductivities for each band and @xmath15 is the fraction of the @xmath5 band that contributes to the total conductivity .",
    "the parameters used for the latter are @xmath16 cm @xmath17 and @xmath18 cm @xmath17 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "although the 2 gap model better describes the data at low frequencies , the improvement is not sufficient to conclude that two gaps must exist .",
    "in fact , previous data on equilibrium infrared spectra of mgb@xmath0 @xcite did not provide any clear cut picture about the presence of two bands in mgb@xmath0 , either .",
    "however , the data does not seem to follow strictly the bcs theory .",
    "film at 5 k ( dots ) .",
    "the lines are fits using the mattis - bardeen optical conductivity for systems with one or two gaps .",
    "( b ) photo - induced reflectivity of mgb@xmath0 film at 5 k ( dots ) .",
    "the lines are attempts to describe the data using the same parameters as those from panel ( a ) .",
    "the dashed line assumes a single gap .",
    "the dotted and continuous lines are calculations for a two gap system . for the former we assume that in the photo - excited state both bands have excess quasiparticles and for the latter",
    ", we assume that all excess quasiparticles find themselves in the lower energy gap band ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the inset in panel ( b ) shows the time dependence of the integrated photo - induced signal.,width=453 ]    an analysis of the time dependent transient photo - reflectance gives us a good estimate of the effective pair recombination rate @xcite .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the average reflectance change as a function of the delay between pump and probe pulses at 6 k. in accordance with other bcs superconductors the effective recombination time is found to be a few nanoseconds .",
    "one important remark is that , within the experimental time resolution , no evidence of multiple decays is found .",
    "in fact , ultra - fast pump - probe measurements on mgb@xmath0 @xcite did not find any evidence for a double relaxation down to the ps regime .",
    "panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the photo - induced spectra taken with pump and probe at coincidence .",
    "the pairs broken by the laser pulse will create an excess quasiparticle population .",
    "owen and scalapino @xcite showed that this excess quasiparticle population weakens the superconducting state .",
    "this weakened state can be spectroscopically detected and resolved as a slightly reduced energy gap allowing the transient photo - reflectance data to be analyzed using the same expressions as those for the equilibrium reflectance .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) assumes that the system has a single gap at 43 @xmath11 which is decreased by photo - excitation .",
    "although the amplitude and overall shape of the signal can be reproduced by this simulation , quantitative agreement is not achieved .",
    "the dotted line assumes that the system has the same two gaps used in the equilibrium reflectance fit and that in the photo - excited state both gaps shrink by an amount consistent with a small rise in the electronic temperature .",
    "the introduction of this second gap does not improve the data description and , actually , introduces new features absent from the data .",
    "our third approach , depicted by the solid line , assumes that the system does have two gaps but that only the smaller energy gap shrinks in the photo - excited state .",
    "this is the behavior one would expect if , after pair - breaking by the laser , the excess quasiparticles are left primarily in the band having the smaller energy gap .     at 151 k ( circles ) and 465 k ( triangles ) . the solid line",
    "are fits with an assymetric dysonian line .",
    "( b ) esr line widths for this work ( circles ) , ref .",
    "( diamonds ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( stars ) .",
    "the solid line is the resistivity ( normalized to compare with the esr data ) from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=453 ]    figure [ fig2](a ) shows the esr signal measured for two temperatures and fits using an assymetric dysonian line shape .",
    "the fit allows us to determine the lande @xmath20 factor and the line width ( @xmath21 ) gives us a measurement of the spin scattering time @xmath22 using @xmath23 .",
    "esr spectroscopy uses a static magnetic field to lift spin states degeneracies by a zeeman splitting and probes the magnetic dipole transitions between these states with a small perpendicular rf magnetic field . in metals",
    ", the high collision rate of quasi - particles defines a single spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath22 .",
    "the electronic spin - orbit interaction has two consequences on the esr response : ( i ) a `` static '' interaction produces a shift in the @xmath20 factor from the free electron value and ( ii ) in the presence of phonons a `` dynamic '' ( time averaged ) interaction leads to the elliott - yafet relation @xcite .",
    "the elliott - yafet relation states that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electronic collision scattering time . in a simple one band model these two relaxation rates are proportional , a fact that has been observed in many metals @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) compares the thermal evolution of the mgb@xmath0 esr linewidth ( this work and refs .",
    "@xcite ) with its dc resistivity extract from ref .",
    "the linewidth is measuring the spin scattering rate and the resistivity gives the electron collision rate . had elliott - yafet been followed , the esr data should agree with the resistivity .",
    "both quantities agree at low temperatures but this agreement breaks down around room temperature .",
    "formally this implies a @xmath20 factor unexpectedly varying with temperature .",
    "however , if one considers that the @xmath2 and @xmath5 bands have different @xmath20 factors , a temperature dependent mixing of these bands leads to a temperature dependent effective @xmath20 .",
    "the photo - induced spectra in the superconducting state and the esr data in the normal state can be understood in terms of an interband scattering process .",
    "when talking about interband scattering , one may think in terms of transfer of quasiparticles or , alternatively , transfer of the energy of quasiparticles .",
    "the latter process can be viewed as a process in which excited quasiparticles in one band relax emitting phonons which can excite quasiparticles in the other band .",
    "there is no transfer of the actual quasiparticles but rather of their energy .",
    "the recent inelastic x - ray scattering data of shukla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that the @xmath1 phonon at around 60 mev is anomanously large in the @xmath26 direction of the brillouin zone , the same direction as the @xmath2 bands .",
    "this @xmath1 phonon is the only phonon showing a large linewidth and it is natural to assume that this effect is coming from a strong coupling with @xmath2 quasiparticles .",
    "however , once created , @xmath1 phonons can scatter quasiparticles in both bands . as the @xmath5 bands occupy a larger volume of the brillouin zone",
    ", it is natural to assume that more quasiparticles in this band will get excited .",
    "this picture naturally explains our data .",
    "the photo excited spectra originates from quasiparticles created by a 1.5 ev laser excitation .",
    "when quickly relaxing from high energies , the quasiparticles in the @xmath2 band eventually reach energies comparable with that of the @xmath1 phonon . at that time",
    "their energy is transfered to the @xmath5 bands leading to a photo - excited state ( at our ns time resolution ) that is composed mostly of excess quasiparticles in the @xmath5 band .",
    "the esr response can be understood in similar terms . in this case",
    "we have no excited quasiparticles . at lower temperatures",
    "the @xmath20 factor is a mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "when we raise the temperature we give enough energy to the quasiparticles to interact with the @xmath1 phonon . eventually , this changes the balance between @xmath2 and @xmath5 bands populations inducing a change in the effective @xmath20 factor .",
    "we looked at the far - infrared equilibrium and photo - induced reflectivity of a mgb@xmath0 thin film and at the esr spectra of powder samples .",
    "the photo - induced response shows one gap at 3 mev and another at 7 mev .",
    "however , excess quasiparticles are only found at the edge of the smaller gap .",
    "esr data on the normal state shows a break down , around room temperature , of the elliott - yafet time relaxation behavior observed in virtually any metal .",
    "these effects can be described in terms of an interband energy transfer process mediated by the anomanously broadened @xmath1 phonon @xcite .",
