    "the evolution of evaporating black holes is a process that has been studied in great detail .",
    "recently we found that a black hole initially described by the kerr metric which is radiating only massless scalar particles via the hawking process , asymptotically evolves towards a state described by a rotation parameter @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this is contrary to the conventional view of an evaporating black hole s evolution which is that an initially rotating black hole will spin down , evolving towards a schwarzschild state before most of its mass has been lost . for black holes emitting solely scalar radiation ,",
    "not only do initially rapidly rotating holes fail to spin down to a schwarzschild state , but holes with initial values @xmath5 will actually spin up as they evaporate , again tending towards an asymptotic state with @xmath4 .",
    "such a hole is losing angular momentum as it evolves , but is losing mass at a higher rate .",
    "the evolution of evaporating black holes described by the schwarzschild and kerr metrics was studied in detail by page@xcite . in particular , page numerically investigated the evolution of a rotating uncharged hole described by the kerr metric that was emitting radiation via the hawking process@xcite .",
    "he found that a black hole emitting nonzero spin particles will lose angular momentum at a greater rate than it loses mass .",
    "such a black hole will reach a state described by @xmath6 by the time it has lost approximately half its mass , allowing the hole to be described by the simpler schwarzschild metric in the late stages of its evolution . while page only investigated radiation by nonscalar fields in detail , he suggested that a hole that is emitting massless scalar particles might evolve differently .",
    "page found that as the black hole evaporated the dominant mode for the nonscalar fields radiation was that which had @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the usual spherical harmonic indices and @xmath10 is the spin of the field .",
    "only a scalar field can radiate in the @xmath11 mode , and , by page s argument , one might expect this mode to be dominant for scalar radiation .",
    "this mode carries off energy from the hole , but no angular momentum .",
    "if a black hole is emitting scalar field radiation and the @xmath11 mode for that radiation dominates the overall emission from both scalar and nonscalar fields , then the hole could lose mass faster than it loses angular momentum .",
    "it would then evolve asymptotically to a state described by a nonzero value of @xmath2 .",
    "this asymptotic value will hereafter be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "this would mean that the hole would always be described by the kerr metric rather than evolving asymptotically toward a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we have shown that this is the case if the black hole emits only scalar field radiation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss in more detail our results reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also determine whether or not the emission of massless scalar particles in addition to radiation from a canonical set of nonzero spin fields ( 3 separate neutrino , photon , graviton ) via hawking radiation can allow a black hole described by the kerr metric to evolve towards an asymptotic state described by a nonzero value of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that a single massless scalar field in addition to the canonical set of nonzero spin fields makes very little change in the evolution found by page@xcite and that the hole will still approach a state described by @xmath13 . in order to reach an asymptotic state described by @xmath12 we find",

    "these include the lifetime of a kerr black hole for a variety of initial conditions , the minimum initial mass a primordial kerr black hole could have possessed assuming it was observed today with a rotation parameter of @xmath3 , the initial mass of a primordial kerr black hole which would have just disappeared today , and the evolution of the area , or equivalently the entropy , of such holes as they evolve .    in section",

    "since the entropy is one quarter the horizon area these results also describe the evolution of the black hole s entropy .",
    "in this paper we have described how the emission of massless scalar field radiation via the hawking process affects the evolution of a kerr black hole in isolation .",
    "we find that for low values of @xmath2 the hole s dominant emission mode for the scalar field is the @xmath11 mode .",
    "this follows the same trend as the nonzero spin fields , namely that the @xmath7 mode dominates the emission .",
    "we found that the scale invariant mass loss rate @xmath43 has a minimum located at a value of @xmath116 for the massless scalar field while in contrast page found that for the nonzero spin fields @xmath43 is monotonically increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath11 mode is not a radiant mode for the nonzero spin fields and this mode dominates the emitted scalar radiation when @xmath2 is small . as @xmath2 increases the higher @xmath8 modes , with @xmath142 , which are superradiant ,",
    "begin to increase in strength while the @xmath143 mode emission decreases due to poor coupling with the hole at high values of @xmath2 .",
    "together these two effects combine to form the minimum .",
    "we also found that the scale invariant angular momentum loss rate for the scalar field is qualitatively similar to the results page found for the nonzero spin fields , being a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 . combining these two results we showed that the quantity @xmath55 which describes the rate at which the angular momentum and mass of the hole are changing relative to each other reaches a value of zero at @xmath1 for a hole emitting purely massless scalar radiation .",
    "this implies that , for the evolution of a black hole - quantized scalar field system , a black hole which possesses any nonzero initial angular momentum will evolve towards an asymptotic kerr black hole state described by this value of @xmath2 , which we argue is a stable point of the evolution . by comparing our value of @xmath144 with",
    "that predicted by page s hypothesized linear relationship for the nonzero spin fields we have shown that the proposed relationship breaks down for the scalar case .",
    "using our results for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the scalar field along with the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 given by page for the nonzero spin fields , one can calculate the evolution of a kerr black hole evolving by the emission of a collection of particles of arbitrary spin .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of a kerr black hole for a number of cases in which the hole is allowed to emit radiation from different fields . for a hole that is emitting only radiation from a single massless scalar field in addition to radiation from the known massless fields ( electromagnetic and gravitational )",
    ", the evolution follows much the same trend as that found by page for purely nonzero spin fields .",
    "we also find that the neutrino fields have very little effect on the evolution due to the fact that they are not superradiant . if we allow the hole to emit radiation from the two known massless nonzero spin fields and three neutrino fields we find that the hole will asymptotically approach a nonzero value of @xmath3 only if there are 32 or more massless scalar fields present .",
    "we also found that the scale invariant lifetime is decreased when a hole is allowed to radiate massless scalar particles in addition to the canonical set due to the addition of new radiative channel .",
    "the initial mass of a black hole that has just now evaporated correspondingly is thus increased , although only slightly .",
    "we also found that by allowing the hole to emit into a massless scalar field in addition to the canonical set of fields slowed the rate at which angular momentum is lost by the hole .",
    "the minimum mass for a hole that is seen today with rotation parameter @xmath63 deviates in a very insignificant matter whether or not the hole is allowed to radiate into the canonical or canonical plus scalar set of fields .",
    "finally the area , and consequently the entropy , was found to be lower at each value of @xmath63 for emission into the canonical plus scalar set of fields versus just the canonical set of fields , again due to the addition of another radiative channel in the form of the scalar field .",
