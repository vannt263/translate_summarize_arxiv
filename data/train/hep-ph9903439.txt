    "the positron - proton collider at hera in the desy facility has opened a window on a rich vein of fascinating physics . in recent years",
    "the range of the available kinematic space for deep inelastic processes has been extended ever further , and for a greater breadth of processes , allowing for increasingly stringent tests on the physics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , at perturbative energies .",
    "pertubative qcd allows us to predict the evolution in kinematic space ( but not the initial form ) of the parton distribution functions .",
    "these in turn drive the equations that describe physical observables . in distinct regions of @xmath5 space",
    "we have two different modes of parton evolution . at high @xmath6 pqcd",
    "requires we resum the contributions of @xmath7 terms .",
    "this yields the well documented dglap equations .",
    "as centre of mass energy @xmath8 , increases at moderate @xmath9 , we can technically encounter a second large logarithm , this time in @xmath10 .",
    "resummation of this type leads to the celebrated balitskij - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation for the gluon .",
    "the bfkl equation corresponds to ladder diagrams with ( reggeized ) gluon exchange along the chain .",
    "one of the main predictions of the bfkl formalism is singular power law small @xmath0 behaviour , @xmath11 , of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the exponent @xmath12 has been calculated at leading order @xcite and next - to - leading order @xcite which contributes large negative corrections to the lo value .",
    "the leading order approximation of the bfkl equation should therefore be regarded as unreliable .",
    "it should be emphasised that the subleading @xmath13 effects are so strong that their next - to - leading ( nlo ) approximation alone is entirely unreliable already for reasonably small , yet relevant values , of the strong coupling , that is for @xmath14 .",
    "the exact form of the sub - leading contribution , resummed to all orders , is unfortunately unknown .",
    "it may however be possible to pin down the dominant non - leading effects of well - defined physical origin , and to perform their exact resummation ( that is going beyond the unreliable next - to - leading approximation ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have identified one class of such sub - leading corrections which followed from imposing a certain kinematical consistency constraint on the available phase space of the emitted gluons along the chain . at the next - to - leading level",
    "this constraint exhausts about 70% of the corrections to the bfkl exponent @xmath12 and , more important , the effects of this constraint can be resummed to all orders . after including the constraint in the ( lo ) bfkl equation , we obtain a formalism which makes it possible to implement the dominant subleading effects and to resum them to all orders . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bfkl equation supplemented by the consistency constraint was used in a quantitative analysis of the structure function @xmath15 within a unified bfkl and dglap scheme . in this paper",
    "we wish to study the effects of these modifications on the properties of final state processes in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , which are particularly sensitive on bfkl dynamics .",
    "these are dis accompanied by a forward jet @xcite and the associated process of dis with forward @xmath1 s @xcite .",
    "the existing calculations of these processes have been performed within a lo bfkl framework , and it is clearly essential to improve the analysis by incorporating the effects of the above constraint . the dis + forward jet measurement first proposed by mueller @xcite can be a very useful tool for probing the bfkl dynamics where the diffusion of the transverse momentum along the gluon chain plays an important role . by choosing the configuration in which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the jet transverse momentum , we eliminate the phase space region of strongly - ordered transverse momenta of the gluons along the chain , i.e. the region @xmath18 , which is the dominant factor driving the increase of @xmath15 in the double leading log approximation .",
    "moreover in the forward configuration @xmath19 , where @xmath0 is the bjorken parameter , we have large subenergy available for jet production that justifies the use of bfkl dynamics",
    ". we can also study dis + forward @xmath1 s",
    "this is a more refined version of the dis + forward jet case , in the sense that we no longer have potential ambiguities derived from hadronisation effects or jet finding algorithms .",
    "the distinguishing features are discussed more fully in section 5 .",
    "we first motivate higher order constraints which should naturally be implemented in a bfkl formalism .",
    "we then show how observables for dis + forward jet/@xmath1 can be calculated from the unintegrated gluon distribution , evolved from the virtual photon end of the bfkl ladder , unlike the hybrid evolution used in ref .",
    "it is more convienient to impose the higher order constraints in the present form of the evolution .",
    "we then compare our calculations with experimental results for dis + forward jet production from h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite , and show a comparison of our analysis with very recent results for @xmath1 cross - sections obtained by the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "finally we estimate the cross - section for production of two jets satisfying the forward criteria .",
    "in this section we shall describe the formalism needed for the theoretical description of the dis + forward jet measurement based on the bfkl equation @xcite .    [",
    "fig : glu ]    the natural quantity driving physical processes in dis in the small bjorken-@xmath0 region of @xmath5 phase - space is the _ unintegrated gluon distribution _",
    ", @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the conventional gluon distributions of a photon of virtuality @xmath6 and polarisation @xmath24 , probed at a scale @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 denotes the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent virtual photon carried by the gluon and @xmath27 denotes its transverse momentum .",
    "the gluon four momentum @xmath28 has the following sudakov decomposition @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the four momentum of the nucleon , and the light - like vector @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 the variable @xmath0 is the bjorken parameter conventionally defined as @xmath33 and , as usual , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the four momentum carried by the virtual photon .",
    "the contribution to @xmath36 arising from the virtual photon can be thought of in terms of virtual photon - gluon fusion through a _",
    "quark - box _ coupled to an equation describing the subsequent evolution of the gluon distribution .",
    "the quark box driving terms , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , can be evaluated perturbatively @xmath39 @xmath40 \\left (   { { \\mbox{\\boldmath${\\kappa_{t}}$ } } \\over d_{1 } } - { { ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath${\\kappa_{t}}$ } } - { \\mbox{\\boldmath${k_{t}}$ } } ) }   \\over d_{2 } } \\right)^{2 } + m_{q}^{2 } \\left ( { 1 \\over d_{1 } } - { 1 \\over d_{2 } } \\right)^{2 } \\right\\ } , \\label{eqn : qbox}\\ ] ] @xmath41 where the denominator functions are @xmath42 @xmath43 the quark mass @xmath44 is set to zero for the light @xmath45 and @xmath46 quarks and taken to be @xmath47gev for the charm quark .",
    "taking these driving terms we then evolve the unintegrated gluon distributions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , using the bfkl equation from the virtual photon end of the bfkl ladder @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 or @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath26 is the fraction of the virtual photon s longitudinal momentum carried by the gluon .",
    "we will show results for infrared cut - off @xmath56 varied within the range @xmath57gev@xmath58 .",
    "we require strong ordering in @xmath59 along the gluon chain @xmath60 the present approach differs from our earlier work @xcite in that we no longer have a free parameter @xmath61 which specifies the end of the bfkl evolution .",
    "in our previous treatment @xcite we performed a hybrid evolution of the gluon ladder in the sense that , while we allowed the @xmath62 diffusion from the quark box , the longitudinal momentum fractions were defined with respect to the proton end of the ladder and strongly ordered along the gluon chain . in that case @xmath61 was adjusted to give the correct normalisation for the dis + jet data . in the present calculation",
    "the normalisation is , in principle , fixed by the theory .",
    "however , in practice , there is freedom due to the choice of the value of qcd scale , which we will quantify later . in summary ,",
    "the present description of the behaviour of the quark - box gluon chain system can be considered as a calculation of the unintegrated gluon content of the virtual photon .",
    "calculations @xcite have shown that the nlo corrections to the bfkl equation are large .",
    "this casts doubt upon the quantitative predictive power of any lo bfkl approach to small @xmath0 dis dynamics .",
    "clearly , for phenomenological purposes , a method of including the higher order effects should be considered .",
    "one origin of subleading effects , which contributes to all orders , is the so called _ consistency constraint _ ( cc ) @xcite .",
    "this requires that the virtuality of the emitted gluons along the chain should arise predominantly from the transverse components of momentum , in order for the small @xmath0 ( small @xmath26 ) approximation to be valid , that is @xmath63 where we have omitted a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "we can motivate the inclusion of the consistency constraint in the analysis by reference to the exponent @xmath12 governing small @xmath0 behaviour , @xmath11 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that by truncating the all order bfkl + cc solution at nlo , one recovers some @xmath65 of the full , explicit nlo calculation in the effective exponent .",
    "it looks reasonable to suppose that this comprises the dominant part of all higher order effects .",
    "another physical source of sub - leading contributions comes from the imposition of the conservation of energy - momentum in multigluon emission .",
    "such an effect has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . it turns out that the consistency constraint subsumes energy - momentum conservation over a wide region of the allowed phase space @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cc ]    the cc places restrictions on the available phase space under the integration in the bfkl equation ( [ eqn : bfkl ] ) .",
    "this manifests itself as a @xmath66-function multiplying the kernel component governing real gluon emissions . upon implementing this ,",
    "we obtain a modified bfkl equation @xmath50 @xmath67 @xmath68",
    "[ fig : bfkl ]    given that measurements of @xmath15 proved unable to unambiguously determine small @xmath0 dynamics , less inclusive alternative approaches were needed .",
    "one such process is mueller s proposal @xcite : @xmath69 according to mueller , dis events containing an identified forward jet provide a particularly clean window on small @xmath0 dynamics . by requiring that @xmath70",
    "we ensure minimal dglap type evolution , and any remaining features must be the result of dynamics from the small @xmath0 limiting region of the @xmath5 phase - space .",
    "moreover by considering jets with large fractions of the proton s longitudinal momentum , @xmath71 allowing @xmath72 to be as small as possible , on the one hand , will allow the use of bfkl dynamics , while on the other hand , involve parton distributions at values of @xmath71 where they are well known .",
    "the kinematics are such that we may use _ strong ordering _ at the parton - gluon - jet vertex @xmath73 where the sudakov decomposition of the jet four momentum in terms of light - like momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 in analogy to ( [ eqn : sudakov ] ) is @xmath74 we can relate the longitudinal momentum fractions at the jet vertex through strong - ordering and the jet on - shell condition , @xmath75 .",
    "this allows us to deduce that @xmath76 @xmath77 using the prescription described in the previous section , we solve numerically for @xmath36 in the modified bfkl equation , via an expansion in chebyshev polynomials , and finally determine the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath78 @xmath79 can then be used to calculate the differential structure functions that drive the forward jet process through @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the sum over parton distributions assuming _ t_-channel pole dominance . @xmath83",
    "these quantities can be substituted into an expression for the differential cross - section for forward jets @xmath84 , \\label{eqn : xs}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "+      finally we are in a position to be able to confront our calculation with the hera data .",
    "we numerically integrate the differential cross - section over the kinematic regions used by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations , see table  [ tab : cuts1 ] .",
    "the results are shown in fig.4 . since the parton distributions ( [ eqn : tpole ] )",
    "are required in a kinematic domain where they are well known the results are not sensitive to the particular set that is used .",
    "however there is a dependence of the results on the qcd scale . to be consistent we use a recent _ leading order _ set of partons .",
    "we take the lo set from @xcite , for which @xmath87gev for four flavours .",
    "the three curves in the figure correspond to the arguments of @xmath88 in ( [ eqn : qbox ] ) and ( [ eqn : partons ] ) and the infrared cut - off in ( [ eqn : mbfkl ] ) being respectively taken to be is less than @xmath56 , in choices ( i ) and ( ii ) , we freeze the coupling at @xmath89 . ] @xmath90 the sensitivity to the choice of scales for @xmath88 is therefore seen by comparing the predictions for ( i ) and ( iii ) , and the sensitivity to the value chosen for the infrared cut - off @xmath56 by comparing ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we see that the uncertainty due to @xmath56 is much less than the uncertainty due to the choice of scales . from fig .",
    "4 we see that the shape of the @xmath0 distributions of the dis + forward jet data are modelled well . moreover the predicted normalisation is satisfactory in that agreement exists for a physically reasonable choice of scales and of the infrared cut - off @xmath56 .",
    "the experimental data correspond to the measurements at the hadron level .",
    "the hadronisation effects can lower the cross - section by about 15 - 20% .",
    "we comment on the comparison with data further in section 7 .",

    "we find a satisfactory description of the shape , and that the normalisation is best described by choice ( iii ) of the scales of ( [ eqn : scales ] ) .",
    "the factor of two overshoot of the data by the previous predictions @xcite is gone .",
    "the reason is the suppresion due to the inclusion of the sub - leading corrections . in figures 7 through 10",
    "we compare our calculations of the @xmath1 differential cross - sections as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , with the new h1 data @xcite . as in the dis + forward jet process",
    ", we see that there is good overall agreement between the predictions and the dis + forward @xmath1 data .",
    "the continuous curves , which are the set which best describe the forward jet data , are on average some 20% above the forward @xmath1 data . however the overall agreement is well within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "( note that no allowance has been made for the uncertainty in the fragmentation functions for the pion ) .",
    "moreover note that the jet data are shown at the hadron level .",
    "if we were to correct for hadronisation effects , then the parton level jet data are expected to be 15 - 20% lower @xcite , and the overall consistency of the qcd description is even better than shown .",
    "if we look at the description of the forward @xmath1 data in more detail then we see , from figs . 7 and 9 , that the @xmath6 behaviour of the dis + forward @xmath1 data is not reproduced in detail by any single one of the three sets of predictions .",
    "for instance for @xmath94gev@xmath58 the continuous curve is below the data , although in agreement within the errors , whereas for @xmath95gev@xmath58 the curve is above the data by about two standard deviations on average .",
    "note that the relative @xmath6 behaviour evident between figs .",
    "7(b , c , d ) simply reflects the comparison of the curves with the data in fig .",
    "however , it is worth repeating that the overall agreement between the predictions of small @xmath0 dynamics and the dis + @xmath1 data is much improved since the previous comparison @xcite .",

    "the calculation , including the consistency constraint , and imposing all the experimental cuts imposed by the h1 collaboration , results in a cross - section of @xmath107 or @xmath108pb depending on the different scales in @xmath88 in ( [ eqn:2jet ] ) chosen as in ( [ eqn : scales ] ) respectively .",
    "the predictions for the two - jet / one - jet ratio give @xmath109 and @xmath110% respectively , to be compared with the h1 measurement of @xmath111% .",
    "that is , small @xmath0 qcd is able to satisfactorily describe the observed rate of forward dijet production .",
    "[ fig : vary ]    the process of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with a forward jet has quite a chequered history . the original `` gold - plated '' proposal of using dis @xmath5 events containing a forward @xmath112 jet to study small @xmath0 dynamics originally dates back to mueller @xcite .",
    "the idea was to study small @xmath113 dynamics with @xmath16 so that dglap effects are absent .",
    "the observation of a forward jet allows the deep inelastic scattering to take place off a parton ( in a domain where the distribution @xmath114 is well known ) so that the small @xmath113 dynamics can be studied free from the uncertainties in proton structure .",
    "the detailed formalism was provided soon after @xcite .",
    "then it was the turn of the experiments to collect a dis + forward jet data sample . to obtain sufficient statistics , jets of relatively low @xmath17 had to be considered , bringing problems of jet identification and measurement .",
    "on the theoretical side all phenmenological analyses @xcite were based on the lo bfkl formalism , with a tendency of the predictions to overshoot the observed dis + forward jet cross - section . at the same time it was also shown that one can not obtain a sufficient increase of the cross - section , with decreasing @xmath0 , from fixed order qcd calculations .",
    "in fact the fixed order ( nlo ) predictions are found to be a factor of 4 or more below the data @xcite .",
    "+ recently a different approach @xcite to forward jet production has been proposed , based on describing the data in terms of the partonic structure of the virtual photon and dglap evolution . in this picture",
    "the dominant contribution in the region @xmath115 to the production of forward jets comes from the hard scattering of partons in the virtual photon with those in a proton .",
    "the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are based on the parton distribution functions of the virtual photon evolved from some ( low ) scale @xmath116 to the scale @xmath117 ( which is greater than @xmath118 but less than @xmath119 ) .",
    "the parton distributions in virtual photons which are used in the estimates of the forward jet cross - sections were taken from ref .",
    "these parton distributions contain a rather arbitrary , although phenomenologically plausible , parameterization of the @xmath6 dependence . at large @xmath6 , however , the parton distributions in the virtual photon are dominated by the point - like contribution which can be completely specified in perturbative qcd .",
    "in fact the approach developed in @xcite is not very sensitive to the specific parameterisation of the parton distributions of the virtual photon .",
    "our calculations based upon the bfkl equation may also be interpreted in terms of hard scattering of partons in a virtual photon . in this case",
    ", however , the @xmath6 dependence of the parton distributions is not arbitrary , but rather is dynamically specified by the impact factor defined by the quark box .",
    "this impact factor corresponds to the point - like @xmath120 coupling .",
    "the analogy with the resolved photon picture becomes more evident if we approximate the bfkl evolution by its double leading logarithm approximation corresponding to strongly - ordered transverse momenta from @xmath6 towards the hard scale @xmath118 .",
    "the bfkl - based calculation should not therefore be interpreted as an alternative explanation to the resolved virtual photon picture since the latter is just part of the former .",
    "the bfkl description also has the merit of treating in a unified way all possible kinematical configurations .",
    "it does not in particular divide the underlying mechanism depending upon the relations between the potentially large scales ( @xmath6 and @xmath118 ) of the problem .",
    "+ there have been two recent developments , both of which we have considered in this paper . first , dis + forward @xmath1 process has also been measured .",
    "these data provide a complementary measurement which overcomes the experimental ambiguities inherent in the measurements of forward jets , albeit at the expense of a reduced rate .",
    "second , as far as bfkl theory itself is concerned , there now exist complete nlo results available .",
    "these indicate that sub - leading effects are very important and can not be neglected in a confrontation of small @xmath0 dynamics with the data . in this paper",
    "we include subleading contributions in the description of dis + forward jet and forward @xmath1 data .",
    "the effect of including the subleading terms can be seen from fig .",
    "we show the predictions for dis + forward jet and dis + forward @xmath1 with and without the consistency constraint included for two physically reasonable choices of scale .",
    "we see that the subleading terms ( that is the consistency constraint ) reduce the predictions at the smaller values of @xmath0 by almost a factor of two .",
    "there is a sizeable ambiguity in the predictions due to the choice of scale , but nevertheless both sets of data favour the inclusion of the sub - leading terms .",
    "even though the subleading effect suppresses the cross - sections , the predictions remain sufficiently steep with decreasing @xmath0 to describe the data . by inspecting the comparison shown in the two plots in fig .",
    "12 we note that , relative to the data , the dis + forward @xmath1 predictions are lower than those for the dis + jet process .",
    "however the comparison for the dis + @xmath1 process is @xmath6 dependent , see fig . 9 and 7 . on average",
    "the forward @xmath1 predictions are about 20% above the data if the scales are chosen so as to give an optimum description of the forward jet data .",
    "this discrepancy is well within the total uncertainties .",
    "moreover , as was mentioned before , the experimental data on the forward jet cross - sections correspond to the measurements at the hadron level , while our theoretical predictions concern the parton level .",
    "the hadronisation effects are expected to raise the parton level jet cross - section by about 15 - 20% @xcite , and so the overall consistency between the forward jet and @xmath1 data and the small @xmath0 qcd predictions shown at the parton level in fig . 12 , is in fact better than shown .",
    "since we can identify and measure less energetic forward @xmath1 s than jets , we are able to sample smaller values of @xmath0 in the former process .",
    "we conclude that there exists an economical , physically - based description of both the dis + forward jet and the dis + forward @xmath1 data in terms of the small @xmath0 qcd framework .",
