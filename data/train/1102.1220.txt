    "the use of electron accelerators is a well established technique for the production of slow positrons , with numerous facilities based on linear accelerators ( linac ) @xcite or microtrons @xcite .",
    "positrons are generated via pair creation when energetic electrons are stopped in a high - z target , the electron - positron converter .",
    "these positrons are then moderated , i.e. slowed to thermal energies , via interaction with a suitable material such as tungsten , and a slow positron beam produced .",
    "the positron production probability increases from threshold ( 1 mev ) with increasing electron energy and typically a value between 14 mev and 100 mev has been used .",
    "however , with the reduction in cost of low energy ( @xmath4 15 mev ) , high - current industrial linacs and development of new types of accelerator such as the rhodotron@xcite it has become appealing to consider producing intense , slow positron beams using low energy , high current electron beams .",
    "one group , at saclay , is developing such a system based on a 6 mev commercial linac@xcite .",
    "for the past 20 years the aist linac has been used to produce high intensity , slow positron beams for materials research@xcite .",
    "a schematic of the aist electron - positron converter and moderator assembly is shown in figure [ aist ] .",
    "electrons with a kinetic energy of 70 mev are directed onto a water cooled tantalum disk with a thickness of 6 mm .",
    "positrons emerging in the forward direction are incident on a moderator composed of strips of 50 @xmath0 m tungsten foil arranged in a rectangular mesh .",
    "slow ( moderated ) positrons are electrostatically extracted from the moderator then formed into a beam and magnetically guided to experimental stations located more than 20 m from ( and well shielded from ) the radiation produced in the converter .    a schematic diagram of the converter and moderator assembly currently in use at the aist linac .",
    "electrons at 70 mev are directed on to a 6 mm thick , water cooled tantalum block in air .",
    "positrons emerging in the forward direction pass through a thin titanium film into vacuum and are incident on an array of 50 @xmath0 m tungsten films arranged in a rectangular mesh . moderated positrons at low energy ( several ev ) are extracted from the moderator assembly by the applied positive potential ( @xmath510 v ) and magnetically guided into a transport beamline . ]",
    "the aist linac operates at a frequency of 100 hz , delivering a pulse of around 30 nc with a pulse width of @xmath6s .",
    "slow positrons are produced with a similar time structure which is impractical for use in positron annihilation spectroscopy ( pas ) type experiments such as doppler broadening of annihilation radiation and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals)@xcite . in practice , the beam is stored in a linear trap and transformed into a quasi - dc beam . in pals this dc beam is chopped and bunched to form a pulse train with a pulse width of around 100 ps and a frequency of around 10 mhz .",
    "this manipulation of the beam timing structure leads to a considerable loss of positrons , typically at most 10% reach the sample in a pals experiment .",
    "if the electron accelerator delivered smaller electron pulses with much higher frequency this situation could be improved .",
    "this is possible with a superconducting accelerator ( sca ) and our group is now developing a dedicated sca for positron production @xcite . in an ideal case the positron beam produced in the converter / moderator could be used in pals experiments without manipulation , resulting in an increased beam transport efficiency .",
    "however , in comparison to the beam energy used at the current aist linac ( 70 mev ) , the proposed sca will be based on an accelerating module with a maximum acceleration of around 7.5 mv .",
    "two such modules , previously used on the jaeri fel project@xcite , have been obtained by our group .",
    "using these modules in a single pass configuration we expect a maximum beam energy of 7.5 mev ( 1 module ) or 15 mev ( 2 modules )",
    ". however , initially we expect to run with slightly lower than maximal field gradient with an expected beam energy of around 5 mev per module .",
    "using an accelerator with a low beam energy substantially reduces the positron production probability although it also leads to a much reduced radiation dose and induced activity from the accelerator .",
    "the maximum of the cross section for neutron production via the giant resonance occurs around 14 mev@xcite for tantalum .",
    "keeping the electron energy below this maximum reduces the required radiation shielding dramatically , an advantage for compact , low - cost systems .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to estimate the yield of slow positrons from the proposed sca .",
    "we report results of monte carlo simulations of the converter and moderator using the penelope2008@xcite code .",
    "penelope2008 can perform calculations over a wide energy range , from a few hundred ev to about 1 gev and provides full support for positron interactions .",
    "it is thus highly suited to modeling of positron production from energetic electron beams .",
    "previously , several groups have reported monte carlo simulations of positron production from electron accelerators@xcite .",
    "in particular gagliardi and hunt@xcite reported a systematic study of tungsten converters at normal and glancing irradiation for a range of incident electron energies .",
    "most previous simulations have concentrated on the fast positron production from the converter . in recent years",
    "there has been progress in developing low energy extensions to the monte carlo code in order to fully simulate the moderation process@xcite . in the present study both the converter and moderator",
    "are simulated using a standard code ( without low energy extensions ) by implementing a well established model of the moderation process .",

    "<S> normalizing the calculated result to the measured slow positron yield at the present aist linac the expected slow positron yield as a function of energy was determined . for an electron beam energy of 5 mev ( 10 mev ) and current 240 @xmath0a ( 30 @xmath0a ) production of a slow positron beam of intensity 5 @xmath1 10@xmath2 s@xmath3 is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation also calculates the average energy deposited in the converter per electron , allowing an estimate of the beam heating at a given electron energy and current . for low energy , high - current operation the maximum obtainable positron beam intensity </S>",
    "<S> will be limited by this beam heating . </S>"
