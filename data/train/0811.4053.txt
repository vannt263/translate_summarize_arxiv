    "since the early works by bethe @xcite and bahcall @xcite great attention has been devoted to the screening effect of coulomb potential on electron capture ( ec ) by nuclei in astrophysical plasmas @xcite and on its implications with neutrino production .",
    "+ the plasma influence has been in great part explored by means of debye - hckel ( dh ) treatment . however , johnson et al .",
    "@xcite found that assumptions for the validity of dh potential are strongly violated in stellar cores , because , among other reasons , the requirement to have many particles in a debye sphere is not fulfilled . at solar conditions",
    "there are only few ( about four ) particles per debye sphere .",
    "rle and importance of several effects in the electron component of a weakly nonideal hydrogen plasma have been recently investigated in @xcite , inducing us to investigate on ec beyond dh approach .",
    "+ the contribution to nuclear ec rate of bound and continuum electrons has been widely studied by shaviv and shaviv @xcite .",
    "they have found that under solar conditions all elements with @xmath6 are fully ionized , therefore the contribution from bound electrons to the capture rate can be disregarded .",
    "formerly , bahcall and moeller @xcite reported that the ratio of the rate from continuum over the rate from bound states is about @xmath7 .",
    "+ fluctuations of electric microfields and debye particle numbers have been investigated by gruzinov and bahcall @xcite and by brown and sawyer @xcite within the feynman density matrix treatment and the mean field theory applied in the boltzmann limit validity , i.e. at global thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "they have found that non - spherical fluctuations can change the reaction rate of about @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath9 percent and that quantum corrections to maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) limit for @xmath10 are less or about @xmath8 percent .",
    "+ screening of coulomb field of the nucleus by outer electrons has been explored by considering the hulthn potential that has a shape very close to a screened coulomb potential . by solving analytically klein - gordon and/or schredinger equations",
    "one can calculate the electron density at the nucleus and consequently derive the fermi factors in terms of hypergeometrical functions @xcite .",
    "+ in all above quoted papers , continuum ec rates are evaluated in the classical statistics limit , using the mb electron momentum distribution that is the correct distribution for coulomb and dh potential @xmath11 , but is not the appropriate distribution to be used with the modified dh ( mdh ) potential @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) introduced by us in @xcite .",
    "the spatial charge distribution related to the last mentioned screening potential differs from the others having a spatial cutoff .",
    "the linear poisson equation used to deduce the screening dh potential must be substituted by a non - linear equation to take into account particle correlations and fluctuations and @xmath12 is deduced as a power law function . in @xcite we have also derived the potential @xmath12 in the framework of the super - statistics approach @xcite , by considering an inverse debye radius fluctuating around its average value given by @xmath14 .",
    "the evaluation of the rate requires non - gaussian generalised @xmath0-distribution of electron momenta with the same value of @xmath0 of the spatial charge density distribution .",
    "+ in this work , we evaluate the variation of the ec rate due to the mdh screening potential over the pure coulomb screening rate as a function of average debye radius @xmath15 and entropic non - extensive parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we consider the case @xmath16 to have a screening potential with finite spatial range .",
    "this peculiarity of some high density astrophysical plasmas and of most of the sun is due to the fact that , in these systems , the mean interparticle distance is smaller or slightly smaller than dh radius @xcite .",
    "standard dh results are obtained in the limit @xmath17 of the electron non - gaussian distribution .",
    "+ the value of the parameter @xmath0 can be fixed by means of its relation with the fluctuation of particles number and of temperature inside the debye sphere , therefore the same value of @xmath0 can be used both for spatial charge density and for momentum distributions .",
    "+ when this treatment is applied to ec by @xmath2be in the solar core , we can derive the amount of the rate enhancement for the electrons of continuum over the dh rate .",
    "we find that , at solar conditions , the rate can increase of about @xmath3  @xmath4 percent over dh screening rate with @xmath0 ranging between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( small deformations of mb distribution ) .",
    "this result can be useful in the interpretation of the observed @xmath2be and @xmath5b neutrino fluxes , in the evaluation of relevant astrophysical @xmath20 factors and of cno solar neutrinos @xcite . for recent discussions and comments on the ec by @xmath2be from a continuum three - body initial state we send to @xcite and references therein .",
    "see @xcite for ec rate evaluated with a percentage of non - thermal fat - tail electron distribution .",
    "+ in section 2 , we report the expressions of the rates evaluated with @xmath0-generalized distribution at few different values of @xmath0 . in section 3 ,",
    "we present numerical results of the rates , for electrons belonging to the continuum for different values of the parameter @xmath0 and focusing to the case of ec by @xmath2be in the solar core .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we outline our conclusions .",
    "it is known that in nuclear continuum ec the evaluation of the rates includes the fermi factor , i.e. the electronic density at the limit of @xmath21 in a pure coulomb potential .",
    "therefore , the pure nuclear rate is corrected because of the coulomb interaction between the captured electron and the nucleus . usually , within a plasma environment , dh potential is adopted in place of coulomb potential . in this case the electron density at the nucleus is known only numerically from the solution of the appropriate schredinger equation . + in an astrophysical environment , the momentum distribution of screening electrons can differ significatively from mb distribution .",
    "we have recently introduced a mdh screening potential to take into account non - linear and correlation effects by means of fluctuation of @xmath22 @xcite . of course ,",
    "also in this case we need to evaluate the electron density at @xmath23 by solving the appropriate schrdinger problem for electrons in the continuum .",
    "+ whereas schredinger solution with a hulthn potential can be given in a close analytic form , the mdh potential ( as well as the standard dh potential ) admits only numerical solutions for the electron density at @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , one can use the hulthn potential that fits quite well the mdh potential in the small @xmath24 region ( near the nucleus ) , but contains an infinite tail instead of having a cut - off at an appropriate value of @xmath25 as for the mdh potential with @xmath26 .",
    "a coulomb cut - off potential , obtained by imposing the condition @xmath27 for @xmath28 and consequent discontinuity in the potential at @xmath29 , was used in the past as the simplest way to screen the coulomb field @xcite . otherwise , in our approach , the cut - off condition arises naturally and the mdh potential is a smooth function for any @xmath30 , vanishing for @xmath28 .    in the following ,",
    "we evaluate the rate for the free electron capture by a @xmath31 nucleus , given by the integral , in the three dimensional space of velocities , of electron capture cross - section @xmath32 times the electron velocity @xmath33 , the normalised probability density @xmath34 or @xmath35 that an electron of the continuum spectrum , with velocity @xmath33 and travelling in a screening potential @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , be at the nucleus with coordinate @xmath23 and the normalised probability that the electron velocity be @xmath33 , probability given by the distribution function @xmath38 ( @xmath1 for c , dh and h , where @xmath39 is the normalized mb distribution of electrons ) .",
    "this distribution must be appropriate to the screening potential used .",
    "we define the pure coulomb nuclear electron capture rate , averaged over a mb distribution , as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the nuclear electron capture cross section @xcite with @xmath42 the fermi constant , @xmath43 the nuclear energy release for one electron with total energy @xmath44 , @xmath45 the well - known reduced nuclear matrix element @xcite .",
    "+ the fermi factor for coulomb potential , given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bohr radius and @xmath49 is the electron momentum , follows from the definition @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the wave function of the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential .",
    "+ the hulthn rate @xmath52 has been evaluated by averaging over mb distribution and by substituting in the coulomb rate of eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) the fermi factor @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is now the wave function of the schrdinger equation with the hulthn potential @xmath55 and , in this case , the fermi factor can be obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "+ finally , the non extensive rate @xmath56 , can be obtained by substituting in eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) the factor @xmath57 with the fermi factor @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be obtained as a numerical solution of the schredinger equation with the modified dh potential @xcite @xmath60^{1/1-q } \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath61 $ ] . +",
    "consistently with the derivation of the mdh potential in the definition of @xmath56 we must insert in place of the mb distribution the normalised non extensive distribution @xmath38 @xcite defined in @xmath62 with @xmath63_+^{1/1-q}$ ] the @xmath0-exponential ( @xmath64_+=x\\,\\theta(x)$ ] where @xmath65 is the heaviside step function ) and for @xmath26 @xmath66 for @xmath1 formula ( [ fq ] ) reduces to the mb distribution .",

    "we pose our attention to the case of solar ec by @xmath2be .",
    "results can be easily extended to any @xmath31 nucleus ( calculations are in progress ) . + in figure 1",
    ", we report , for several value of @xmath15 the quantity @xmath70 where x@xmath71h , dh and @xmath0 ( with @xmath72 ) that represents the percentage variation of probability density at @xmath23 compared to the probability density when the screening potential is a pure coulomb potential .    bahcall and moeller @xcite and gruzinov and bahcall @xcite have found that , for @xmath73 and @xmath10 , the quantity @xmath74 is less than @xmath8 percent , for @xmath75 about @xmath9 percent and",
    "have concluded that plasma screening is unimportant for capture from continuum .",
    "our calculation of dh electron density at @xmath23 ( which corresponds to the case of @xmath1 ) agrees with their results .",
    "however , in @xcite and @xcite the above authors have calculated the rate averaging over mb distribution , in the frame of a global thermodynamical equilibrium , therefore they have found a negligible screening effect over coulomb rate and a negligible effect of fluctuations and correlations over dh rate . although electron density at @xmath23 due to @xmath12 is smaller than coulomb density , in the velocity space the probability density in the low momentum region is greater than mb because the continuum electron distribution @xmath38 we use in this work privileges low momentum electrons .",
    "therefore , screening may be important in continuum ec rate .",
    "this can be seen in table 1 , where we report the calculated deviations of the rate @xmath76 respect to @xmath77 , by means of the function @xmath78 at the value of @xmath79 ( where ec by @xmath2be takes place ) , for the three values of @xmath0 of figure 1 .",

    "we have verified that deviations depend very smoothly on @xmath89 except for @xmath90 and depend very strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "+ the value of @xmath0 for ec by @xmath2be in solar plasma can be derived from the expression that links @xmath0 to fluctuation of @xmath91 @xcite . by using the equation of state for @xmath0-nonextensive systems",

    "of course , a smaller value of @xmath0 should imply a much greater enhancement of ec rate over dh one .",
