    "the low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the leading candidates for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "since we have not seen yet any superpartner of the sm particle , susy must be a softly broken symmetry .",
    "however once arbitrary soft susy breaking parameters are introduced into the model , susy contributions to several flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes and electric dipole moments ( edm ) spoil the consistency between the observations and the sm predictions based on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite ( so - called  susy flavor problem \" and  susy cp problem \" @xcite ) .",
    "one of the solutions to avoid these problems is to assume certain mechanism which realizes that at some high energy scale sfermion masses are diagonal and universal in flavor space , and each scalar trilinear coupling is proportional to the corresponding yukawa coupling (  universal solution \" ) @xcite .",
    "however in order to avoid edm constraints , an additional assumption is required .",
    "we usually assume that all the susy breaking parameters and susy higgs mass parameter @xmath1 are real .",
    "one of the biggest mysteries is how to realize this assumption on cp invariance for the susy breaking sector while the yukawa couplings must be complex to obtain the large kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase .",
    "another solution for these problems is to raise susy breaking scale @xcite .",
    "then the susy contributions to the fcnc processes and edms can be decoupled (  decoupling solution \" ) .",

    "we study a situation where the cp symmetry is effectively broken in the down-(s)quark ( and the charged ( s)lepton ) sector but not in the up-(s)quark sector at the scale of spontaneous cp violation .",
    "then the above mentioned up quark cedm induced via the stop loop can be well suppressed since parameters appearing in fig.[fig : non - decoupling susy contributions to cedms ] ( b ) turn out to be almost real . at the same time the km phase is provided from the down - quark yukawa couplings which are complex .",
    "even if real up-(s)quark sector is assumed at the gut scale it becomes complex at the low - energy .",
    "we estimate this effects and show that the up quark cedm induced via the stop loop can be suppressed within the range where the current and future experiment have their sensitivity .",
    "moreover we show that such an assumption can be simply realized by the spontaneous cp violation in e@xmath47 susy gut with su(2 ) flavor symmetry .",

    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath7 sfermion universality is efficient to evade the most part of susy flavor problem and susy cp problem without destabilizing the weak scale . at the same time , however , there is inevitable non - decoupling susy contribution to the up quark cedm induced via the stop loop if their masses are placed in the weak scale in view of the naturalness . to solve this difficulty , in this section ,",
    "we quantitatively examine how taking the real up-(s)quark sector works to reduce the up quark cedm induced via the stop loop .      in this subsection",
    "we clarify our assumption of the real up-(s)quark sector .",
    "suppose the spontaneous cp violation in the flavor breaking sector .",
    "then the unified gaugino mass @xmath48 , @xmath45 and @xmath49 , that are independent of the flavor symmetry breaking can be expected to be real and yukawa couplings and a - terms become complex generically .",
    "however in order to suppress the non - decoupling susy contribution to the up quark cedm described in the previous section , here we assume that the up - type quark yukawa couplings and corresponding a - term are real when these are induced by the flavor symmetry breaking whose scale is assumed to be near the gut scale . in summary",
    "we categorize yukawa couplings , susy breaking terms and @xmath45-term into the following two sets at the gut scale .",
    "* real * * @xmath48 , @xmath45 , @xmath49 * * @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 * complex * * @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 + [ test ]    for a - terms , we assume that they duplicate the hierarchical structures of the corresponding yukawa couplings but we do not require the exact proportionality among them , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can not be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "we introduce @xmath58 to denote the typical scale of @xmath59-terms as @xmath60 @xmath61 . in connection with this assumption for a - terms ,",
    "since @xmath62 is complex , we will take constraints from the down and strange quark cedms into account in the following analysis .",
    "even though these cedm have decoupling features in the limit @xmath63 , the recent update on the @xmath37hg edm constrains relevant susy breaking parameters considerably .      in this subsection",
    ", we quantitatively examine real up-(s)quark sector .",
    "first of all , the up quark cedm would be vanishing if the up sector has had only real parameters .",
    "however , even if @xmath64 is real at the input scale , it receives imaginary phases through the rg effects .",
    "here we evaluate this effect schematically . in the basis",
    "where @xmath21 is diagonal , @xmath65 can be written as @xmath65=@xmath66 , where @xmath67 is diagonal yukawa matrix , @xmath68=diag@xmath69 and @xmath70 is the ckm matrix .",

    "in this paper we discussed the susy cp problem that arises when the sfermion soft mass universality is @xmath7 as in eq . and @xmath10 is placed in the weak scale in view of the naturalness .    in order to suppress up quark cedm induced by the weak scale stop pair we employed certain type of favor structure where the parameters of up-(s)quark sector are real whereas those of down-(s)quark and charged ( s)lepton sectors are complex at the gut scale .",
    "it has shown that , in this set up , the up quark cedm can be suppressed within the range where the current and future experiment have their sensitivity .    in sec.[sec : model of flavor dependent cp violation ] , we briefly illustrated the simple realization of these particular forms of the @xmath7 sfermion universality with real up-(s)quark sector by the spontaneous cp violation in the e@xmath0 susy gut with su(2 ) flavor symmetry . by virtue of the twisting among the su(5 ) @xmath212 matter fields , those are easily obtained .",
    "the model building of the spontaneous cp violation in the e@xmath0 susy gut is an interesting topic itself which is discussed in the upcoming paper @xcite .",
