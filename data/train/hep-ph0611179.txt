    "it is well known that    * the leading order ( lo ) hadronic contribution to @xmath3 , @xmath7^{had , lo}$ ] , can be written as a dispersive integral @xmath8^{had , lo}\\ , = \\ , { \\frac{\\alpha_{em}^2}{3\\pi^2}}\\ , \\int_{4m_\\pi^2}^\\infty ds\\ , { \\frac{k(s)}{s}}\\ , r(s ) \\label{amudispersive}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 a known function and @xmath10}{16\\pi\\ ,   \\alpha_{em}^2}}\\ ] ] * as a consequence of cvc , the @xmath0 parts of both @xmath11 and the hadronic @xmath1 decay distribution provide experimental determinations of the @xmath0 vector spectral function , @xmath12 , allowing @xmath1 decay data to , in principle , be incorporated into the determination of @xmath7^{had , lo}$ ]  @xcite * after known isospin - breaking ( ib ) corrections to the cvc relation have been performed , the current @xmath1 and electroproduction ( em ) versions of @xmath12 do not agree  @xcite , leading to incompatible determinations of @xmath7^{had , lo}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-based determination corresponds to a sm value for @xmath3 compatible , within errors , with the bnl e821 experimental result  @xcite , while the most recent assessment of the electroproduction ( em ) determination leads to a value in @xmath13 disagreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured em version of @xmath12 and that implied by ib - corrected @xmath1 decay data is now generated essentially entirely by contributions from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states .",
    "the differences , moreover , are such that , where the two @xmath12 determinations disagree , that based on the @xmath1 data lies higher",
    ". figures of the preliminary belle @xmath16 data  @xcite indicate that , while the region over which a discrepancy is observed to occur may be shifted by the belle results , it remains true that , where disagreement exists , it is the @xmath1 version which is higher .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the uniformity in sign of @xmath17 makes it rather easy to construct finite energy sum rules ( fesr s ) which distinguish between the two versions of @xmath12 .",
    "the form of these fesr s is @xmath18 where @xmath19 in an analytic weight function , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the relevent ( charged or neutral current ) @xmath0 vector current correlator .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is to be chosen large enough that the ope representation of @xmath23 can be used on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ basicfesr ] ) . for weights",
    "@xmath24 which are ( i ) functions of the dimensionless variable @xmath25 and ( ii ) both non - negative and monotonically decreasing on the interval @xmath26 , it follows that , if the @xmath1 data is correct , then both the slope with respect to @xmath22 and the magnitude of the em spectral integrals _ for all @xmath22 _ will be too small , relative to ope expectations .",
    "similarly , if the em data is correct , then both the magnitude and slope with respect to @xmath22 of the @xmath1 spectral integrals will be too large , relative to ope expectations .",
    "it is worth stressing that , for the ope integrals , the slope with respect to @xmath22 is considerably less sensitive than is the normalization to the main ope input , @xmath27 .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion below .    in the analysis reported here",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath28 , which choice strongly suppresses residual ope breakdown for weights , @xmath19 , having a zero at @xmath29  @xcite . at these scales , the ope representation is strongly dominated by the @xmath30 perturbative contribution , and hence well - determined once @xmath27 is given at some particular reference scale .",
    "the needed input value is obtained by averaging the independent high - scale determinations of @xmath31 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which yields @xmath32 .",
    "values relevant to the lower scales required in this analysis are then obtained via 4-loop running and matching  @xcite .",
    "details of the relevant input for , and treatment of , higher dimension ope contributions may be found in ref .",
    "the weights used below , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , are chosen to strongly reduce sensitivity to potential poorly known @xmath36 ope contributions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 also have a double zero at @xmath29 , further suppressing possible residual ope breaking contributions .",
    "the @xmath0 hadronic @xmath1 decay distribution has been measured by aleph  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and opal  @xcite .",
    "the results below are based on the aleph determination , for which the covariance matrix has been made publicly accessible .",
    "additional corrections for long - distance em effects , as evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite , are applied to the @xmath4 component of the @xmath1 data  @xcite . for pre-2003",
    "em data , we employ the results for various exclusive modes reported in the compilation of ref .",
    "small missing modes are accounted for using isospin relations and the techniques described in detail for such modes in ref .",
    "post-2003 updates for a number of modes  @xcite have also been taken into account . where uncertainties exist in older publications concerning the treatment of radiative corrections and/or systematic errors , and newer data with no such uncertainties are available , we employ only the newer data .",
    "examples of the results of the comparison between the spectral integrals and ope expectations , for the em case , are shown in figures [ fig1em ] and [ fig2em ] , for the weights @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "analogous results for the ib - corrected @xmath1 case are shown in figures [ fig1tau ] and [ fig2tau ] , respectively .",
    "we see that the normalization and slope of the @xmath1 spectral integrals are in excellent agreement with ope expectations , while both the normalization and slope are low in the em case .",
    "the same behavior is found for fesr s based on other non - negative , monotonically decreasing weights , though for brevity we have displayed only the @xmath38 and @xmath39 results . as noted above",
    ", this pattern is the one expected if it is the @xmath1 data which are correct and the em data which are wrong .",
    "( note , however , that an alternate @xmath1 spectral distribution which , like the preliminary belle @xmath1 @xmath4 distribution , is larger for some @xmath40 but smaller for other @xmath40 than is the corresponding aleph distribution , is also capable of satisfying the ope constraints ; i.e. , the fact that the constraints are satisfied by the aleph data does not necessarily imply that the aleph data set is correct . )                        finally , we consider the relative role of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of the @xmath0 @xmath1-em spectral function difference in producing the agreement between the ope constraints and the @xmath1-modified `` em '' spectral integrals . since @xmath43^{had , lo}$ ] is more strongly dominated by the @xmath4 component of the spectral function than are the spectral integrals appearing on the lhs s of the fesr s employed in our analysis , this question is of relevance to determining the implications of our results for @xmath43^{had , lo}$ ] .",
    "the relative @xmath4 and @xmath5 contributions to the spectral integral shifts caused by the @xmath44 replacement are shown , for our two representative weights , in table  3 .",
    "the results for the other @xmath45 are similar to those for @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath4 component is seen to dominate for @xmath47 and remain important for @xmath42 .",
    "since the agreement between different experiments for the em @xmath15 cross - sections is , at present , not good  @xcite , it is of relevance to consider the impact of replacing only the @xmath5 component of the em spectral function with the corresponding @xmath1 component .",
    "the impact of this change on the normalization and slope of the em spectral integrals is shown in table  4 .",
    "we see that , were future results to bring the em @xmath5 cross - sections into agreement with expectation based on @xmath1 decay data , the difference between the slope and normalization of the em spectral integrals and the ope constraint values would be reduced to the @xmath48 level .",
    "such a change would also reduce the discrepancy between the em - data - based sm prediction for @xmath3 and both the @xmath1-data - based sm prediction and the e821 experimental result  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath1 and em versions of @xmath43^{had , lo}$ ] would also be reduced were the @xmath49 reduction , relative to the earlier @xmath1 average , seen in the preliminary belle result for the @xmath4 contribution , to remain present in the final version of the analysis .",
    "such an improved em-@xmath1 consistency , according to the results of this study , would almost certainly be accompanied by a reduction in the difference between the experimental @xmath3 value and the em - based sm prediction .",
    "such a development would make even more important the role of a reduced experimental uncertainty  @xcite in determining whether or not beyond - the - sm contributions have been detected in @xmath3 .",
