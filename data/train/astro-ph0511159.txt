    "the continuum is almost featureless for a distrubution of plasma temperatures and in addition , the continuum from the letgs instrument is unreliable due to the cc mode ( nordon et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore line fluxes alone are used to derive the emission measure distribution ( emd ) .",
    "the observed line flux @xmath10 of ion @xmath11 due to the atomic transition @xmath12 can be expressed by means of the element abundance with respect to hydrogen @xmath13 , the distance to the object @xmath14 , the line power @xmath15 and the ion fractional abundance @xmath16 as :    @xmath17    we use the primary line ( selected bright , weakly blended , usually resonant line ) from every fe ion in the observed spectra to get a set of integral equations ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lineflux ] ) , whose solution yields the emd scaled by the unknown fe abundance .",
    "for other elements , we use ratios of the he - like to h - like line fluxes instead of absolute fluxes , thus the element abundance @xmath13 cancels out .",
    "this adds another set of equations that constrain the shape of the emd , and do not depend on the abundances :    @xmath18    the x - ray spectra include as many as ten fe ions but no more than two ions from other elements . in total , we get 14 equations for the flare and quiescence observations , but different equations , depending on which lines are visible .",
    "we fit the line fluxes and flux ratios using the _",
    "least squares best fit _ method to solve for the emd , where the emd is expressed by a parameteric non - negative function of @xmath19 .",
    "this method yields the estimated shape of the emd , independent of any assumptions for the abundances , and is scaled by the fe abundance .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "[ eq : lineflux ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : fluxratio ] is cut - off at 8  kev beyond which the emd is completely degenerate .",
    "this means that some of the em in the last bin could be attributed to even higher temperatures .",
    "the atomic data for the line powers are calculated using the hullac code @xcite . in order to measure the line fluxes and solve for possible blending ,",
    "we preform an ion - by - ion fitting to the spectra .",
    "the line powers for each ion are calculated at its maximum emissivity temperature and then passed through the instrument response .",
    "the observed spectra are fitted by a set of complete individual - ion spectra simultaneously , resulting in an excellent fit that accounts for all the observed lines and blends .",
    "this process is similar to the one used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the line fluxes used in the emd fitting are listed in @xcite .",
    "the ionic abundances ( @xmath16 ) for : fe , ar , s , si , mg are taken from @xcite , whereas @xcite is used for the other elements .",
    "our goal is to compare the emd of the flare and quiescence states .",
    "it is important to note that the solution for the emd is not unique as is the case with integral equations of this sort @xcite . on scales much smaller than the width of the ions emissivity curves , or in temperature regions where there are no emissivity peaks of any ion",
    ", there is no way of constraining the emd .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to compare the emd solutions , the confidence intervals of the solution are as important as the actual values . we choose to fit a _ staircase _ shaped function to allow for local confidence intervals estimates .",
    "since the errors on the em can be non - linear in the parameters ( due to the flux ratio equations ) , localized asymptotic confidence intervals are inappropriate .",
    "we use the @xmath20 probability distribution to get the confidence intervals , by searching the model parameters space for a target @xmath20 surface .",
    "the deviation of the target @xmath20 from the best - fit value gives the confidence level .",
    "this also includes uncertainties due to non - zero covariances between parameters .",
    "the fitted emd of @xmath0 geminorum  during flare and quiescence are plotted in figure  2 . with 90%  confidence intervals .",
    "the value of the emd in each bin represents the average emd over the bin .",
    "selecting the number of bins and their widths is not trivial .",
    "since , as discussed above , we are interested in meaningful confidence intervals , we can not use narrow bins , as this will result in excessive error bars .",
    "the line emissivity curves have considerable widths and some extend to temperatures much higher than their peak emissivity , resulting in strong negative correlations between the em in neigbouring bins . therefore , on small enough scales we have no information on how the em is distributed and we can only constrain the total em ( or average emd ) over a bin s temperature range .",
    "the errors on the measured fluxes increase the uncertainty on the em even further .",
    "ultimately , if meaningful confidence intervals are to be obtained , the number of bins has to be kept small and their width optimized according to the constraints in each region .",
    "[ fg : emd_plot ] , with 90%  confidence intervals .",
    "emd is scaled according to solar fe abundance , taken to be : fe / h = 4e-5.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the important physical quantity is the _ integral _ of the emd over a range of temperatures .",
    "the integrated em from zero to @xmath21 is plotted in the bottom panel of figure  2 . with 90%  confidence bars .",
    "the uncertainties caused by the strong correlation between the emd bins disappear with integration , resulting in much smaller error bars .",
    "several works comparing different emd reconstruction methods showed that while the representation of the emd is heavily model dependent , the total integrated em stays remarkably the same ( for example , fludra & sylwester , 1986 ) .",
    "an important exception to this is when significant amounts of em exist at temperatures where all line emissivities are low , such as beyond the emissivity peaks of the highest fe degrees .",
    "simple heating of the plasma does not change the total em , therefore variations in the total em indicate added material , changes in density or both .",
    "the total integrated em up to 3  kev is slightly higher during the flare , although still consistent with the quiescence em , within the 90%  confidence intervals .",
    "the total em up to the 8  kev cut - off during the flare is 5.4@xmath221.9 times that of the quiescence em , which is very large in a bright system such as @xmath0 geminorum , so it is unlikely that such a huge amount of plasma is added to the corona .",
    "the more likely interpretation is that the hot em originates from plasma heated lower in the chromosphere , where the higher density would result in a large em , even for a small amount of evaporated plasma .",
    "the increase in density was not detected here , but this could be due to the high charge states ( h - like and bare ) typical of the high - t flare , for which no density diagnostics are available .",
    "once we have solved for the emd , abundance calculations are made easy . in order to extract the x / fe abundance ratios",
    ", we simply calculate the non - fe line fluxes ( eq .  [ eq : lineflux ] ) from the fe - scaled emd .",
    "the ratio between the measured and calculated flux gives the abundance value .",
    "we use abundance ratios relative to fe and not to h since this is based on line emission ratios , while h does not emit lines at the relevant temperatures and abundances relative to h have to rely on ambiguous continuum modeling .    no statistically significant abundance variations between flare and quiescence were detected .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the abundances are the same since the high temperatures in the flare can make the detection of abundance variations difficult , as we explain in section 5 .",
    "the inversion of a set of integral equations as presented above is not unique .",
    "even for very small errors on the measured fluxes , we get an infinite number of possible solutions ( in the _ least squares sense _ ) . therefore , estimating the emd uncertainties is crucial for the physical interpretation of the emd and for comparisons between different activity epochs .",
    "it is important to note that the emd uncertainty in a given @xmath19 range is caused by a degeneracy of the inversion problem itself and not merely by the errors on measured fluxes , as we will explain below .",
    "this is not a problem caused by a model .",
    "the goal is to find what variations on the _ source _ emd will result in indistinguishable spectra and to determine the maximal temperature resolution which can be achieved , regardless of our specific emd representation or method of solution .",
    "we would like to define a measure for the degeneracy of the emd solution at a given temperature t. for simplicity of notation let us define @xmath23 as the emissivity of an observed line @xmath24 :    @xmath25    using this definition , the observed line flux ( eq .  [ eq : lineflux ] ) can be written as :    @xmath26    @xmath27 defines the contribution of the plasma at temperature interval @xmath28 $ ] to each observed line flux @xmath29 scaled by @xmath30 .",
    "the emd contributions at a given temperature @xmath19 to all of the observed line fluxes @xmath29 ( @xmath24=1 .. n , number of observed lines ) forms a vector @xmath31 .",
    "let us now quantify the similarity between the emissivity vectors at different @xmath19 . in other words , how much plasma at @xmath32 can be replaced with plasma at @xmath33 and still produce the same observed line fluxes within the observational errors .",
    "varying the emd at @xmath34 by @xmath35 , results in a deviation in the line flux vector @xmath36 .",
    "this deviation can be compensated partially by another emd variation at temperature @xmath33 , @xmath37 .",
    "if vector @xmath38 were parallel to @xmath39 , there would be total compensation .",
    "therefore we would not distinguish between plasma at @xmath34 and plasma at @xmath33 .",
    "in the general case , the deviation in the observed line fluxes is :    @xmath40    the condition for @xmath41 to be minimal , is that @xmath42 satisfies :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the angle between the emissivity vectors of temperatures @xmath34 and @xmath33 :    @xmath45    the _ correlation angle _ @xmath46 is a measure of the spectral similarity of plasmas at different @xmath19 . in practice",
    "one needs to weigh flux deviations by the errors on the measured line fluxes @xmath47 .",
    "we can define a modified emissivity vector @xmath48 whose components are @xmath49 . an appropriate _ correlation angle _",
    "@xmath50 can then be defined :    @xmath51    consequently , we define a simple expression for a @xmath20-like significance that represents the ability to discriminate between the emds that produce the two sets of line fluxes :    @xmath52    now , the minimization of @xmath53 requires that :    @xmath54    we can use @xmath55 to define and map a _ degeneracy length _ which will set a minimum temperature width to features we can detect in the emd , with respect to their em ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the limit is set by : @xmath57    any emd variations of am amount @xmath56 or less of total em inside this temperature range will produce the exact same spectra up to the accuracy of measurement , quantified by @xmath53 .",
    "this approach can be expanded to include also the continuum by measuring it at different wavelengths and treating the flux at those wavelengths as lines .",
    "however , we do not use the continuum here since it was not used in the @xmath0 geminorum  analysis .     to fe@xmath9 .",
    "colour scale is @xmath58 . selecting a temperature @xmath34",
    "the contour lines mark the temperature uncertainty @xmath33 for the corresponding em . around 1",
    "kev we get good constraints due to fe@xmath59 to fe@xmath60 having narrow emissivity curves that peak between 500 and 1600 ev .",
    "the problematic region around 3  kev is marked by contour lines stretching outside of the map . ]      setting @xmath61 and using only fe lines , where flux errors are taken from the flare observation in @xcite , the mapping of @xmath62 is plotted in figure  [ fg : corr_mapping ] .",
    "we note that @xmath56 tends to infinity at @xmath63 .    in order to make reading and understanding of figure  [ fg : corr_mapping ] easier , cross sections of the map at fixed @xmath34",
    "are plotted in figure  [ fg : crossection ] .",
    "the width of a curve at a given em is the fundamental uncertainty in temperature for a component of that size .",
    "for example , the crossection at @xmath64  kev shows that an em amount of @xmath65  @xmath66 from this temperature may be redistributed within an interval of @xmath220.1  kev and still produce the same spectra in the sense of @xmath67 . therefore using bins of less than 0.2  kev width around this temperature is meaningless if the average emd @xmath681.5 10@xmath69  @xmath66 kev@xmath5 . in the case of @xmath0 geminorum ,",
    "the average emd at @xmath64  kev was only slightly higher @xmath702.2 10@xmath69  @xmath66kev@xmath5 , which will result in emd uncertainty making it almost consistent with zero .",
    "eventually a 0.8 - 1.2  kev bin was used in figure  2 in order to have much more em in the bin than this uncertainty value .",
    "using averaged emd over a wider bin allows us to put meaningful , well _ localized _ constraints on the emd at the cost of temperature resolution .",
    "as temperature rises the constraint generally becomes weaker and bins containing more total em are needed . in figure",
    "[ fg : corr_mapping ] the problematic region around 3  kev , where there is a gap between the emissivity peaks of fe@xmath60 and fe@xmath8 , is clearly visible by the bend in the contour lines .",
    "this is the reason the 3  kev bin in figure  2 is poorly constrained .",
    "one has to remember that the mapping of @xmath71 is observation - specific , as it depends on the line flux errors .",
    "still , we can conclude that generally : the fundamental degeneracy is caused by the slow variation with @xmath19 of the emissivity vector @xmath31 .",
    "the scale of the degeneracy problem is set by the absolute value of the _ modified _ emissivity vector @xmath72 which can be understood as a signal - to - noise ratio per em unit .     at various constant @xmath73 values .",
    "note that @xmath74 em tends to infinity at @xmath75 . ]",
    "when a large amount of em is located at high temepratures , as is often the case in large flares on rscvn systems , several difficulties in measuring plasma parameters arise .",
    "when temperatures are high enough , a significant portion of the elements are in their h - like ionic form or worse - bare , and line diagnostics lose power .",
    "our ability to measure densities relies mostly on he - like triplets .",
    "however , in a two - phase scenario like in @xmath0 geminorum , what we measure in practice is the density of the surrounding cooler quiescent plasma and not the density in the flaring region where there are no he - like ions . in figure  [ fg : emissivities ] we plot the normalized emissivities of lines available in the rgs ( plus the he - like &  h - like fe from epic ) during the flare .",
    "we see that the emissivity of he - like ions ( dashed lines in lower panel ) is extremely low above 2  kev .",
    "the same problem applies to abundances .",
    "for example , a high abundance of oxygen in a @xmath76  kev region is invisible to us since at 6  kev oxygen is in the bare state ( but we will still detect the undisturbed surrounding cooler plasma ) .",
    "we can also see from figure  [ fg : emissivities ] that the kt range of 0.5 - 2  kev is well covered by eight fe ionization degrees and most of the other elements .",
    "emission from higher kt is covered only by the highest degrees of fe - mostly fe@xmath8 and very weak tail - end emission of h - like ions of other elements , which leads to higher uncertainties in the emd , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the emissivity of mg@xmath77 , although peaking at @xmath70850  ev stretchs out to temperatures far beyond the peak and into the range of the flare temperatures . in the rgs",
    "it will be the only non - fe ion to be effected from em above 2  kev as si@xmath78 usually suffers from high noise and is not useful .",
    "in this @xmath0 geminorum  example we determined the flaring plasma to be mostly above 3  kev .",
    "therefore , all density measurements and element abundances of c , n , o , ne , mg and si ( available in the rgs ) during the flare are in essence , measurements of the surrounding quiescent plasma . in this observation",
    "we do not have post - flare data since the observation ended before the flare fully decayed , but in such a case it will be interesting to measure the abundaces immediately after the flare , when most of the flaring plasma has cooled to quiescent temperatures .",
    "still , if the large em of the flare originated in the higher densities of the chromosphere , the evaporating plasma will rise and cool in the less - dense corona . hence , the em will drop significantly and we might not be able to detect variations on the significant background emission of the surrounding plasma unrelated to the flare .    in conclusion , results of previous works , where some detect density and abundance variations in large flares and some do not , may depend heavily on the temperatures in the flare and the amount of surrounding quiescent plasma , and not only on what actually happened in the flare .",
    "variations in the thermal structure of the plasma are elusive due to the difficulty of determining the uncertainties of possible emd solutions on small scales .     stretching out to high t. si@xmath78",
    "is on the edge of the rgs instrument and suffers from very bad signal to noise ratio , so its contribution to constraints on the emd is minimal .",
