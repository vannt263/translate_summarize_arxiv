    "given @xmath1 pairwise distinct real points and @xmath2 , let us consider a degree @xmath3 polynomial @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "such a polynomial is a _",
    "least squares fit _ to the data if it minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations from the data , @xmath6 computing the coefficients @xmath7 of that polynomial @xmath8 is equivalent to solve , in the least squares sense , the overdetermined linear system @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is the rectangular @xmath10 vandermonde matrix corresponding to the nodes @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath0 is usually an ill - conditioned matrix , it was early recognized that solving the normal equations was not an adequate method .",
    "golub [ 7 ] , following previous ideas by householder , suggested the use of the _ qr factorization _ of @xmath0 , which involves the solution of a linear system with the triangular matrix @xmath13 .",
    "let us observe that , if @xmath14 with @xmath15 being an orthogonal matrix , then using the condition number in the spectral norm we have @xmath16 that is , @xmath13 inherits the ill - conditioning of @xmath0 while @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , as it was already observed by golub in [ 8 ] ( see also section 20.1 of [ 9 ] ) , although the use of the orthogonal transformation avoids some of the ill effects inherent in the use of normal equations , the value @xmath18 is still relevant to some extent .",
    "it is frequently assumed that this happens when bases of orthogonal polynomials , such as the basis of chebyshev polynomials , are considered . however , this fact is true when special sets of nodes are considered , but not in the case of general nodes .",
    "a basis which leads to a matrix @xmath0 better conditioned than the vandermonde matrix is the bernstein basis of polynomials , a widely used basis in computer aided geometric designed due to the good properties that it possess ( see , for instance , [ 2,10 ] ) .",
    "we illustrate these facts with table @xmath19 , where the condition numbers of vandermonde , chebyshev - vandermonde and bernstein - vandermonde matrices are presented for the nodes considered in example 5.1 and in example 5.2 .",
    "* remark 5.3 .",
    "* the accuracy of our algorithm is obtained by exploiting the structure of the bernstein - vandermonde matrix .",
    "every step of our algorithm , except the ones in which the standard matrix multiplication command of matlab is used , are developed with high relative accuracy because only arithmetic operations that avoid subtractive cancellation are involved [ 12,13 ] .",
    "our algorithm has the same computational cost ( @xmath23 arithmetic operations ) as the conventional algorithms that solve the least squares problem by means of the qr decomposition ignoring the structure of the matrix , when @xmath15 is explicitly required ( see section 2.4.1 of [ 1 ] ) .",
