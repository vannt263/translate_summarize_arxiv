    "in order to recover the flux from all the angular scales and a complete velocity field , 21 cm data were obtained using the drao synthesis telescope ( landecker et al .",

    "details of the data reduction procedure can be found in taylor et al .",
    "gaussian profiles were fitted to the  data - cube to extract the different moment maps .",
    "figures  [ fig1]a and [ fig1]b present the provisional integrated intensity map of the 21 cm emission line and its corresponding velocity field .      because m31 is known to have a warped disk , a tilted ring model has to be fitted to the velocity field .",
    "it allows to derive accurate kinematical parameters and rotation velocities as a function of radius .",
    "we focus on the approaching half of the disk in order to compare with the rc from carignan et al .",

    "the warp of m31 does not contaminate so much the  disk kinematics at large radius , at least in its approaching half . as a consequence , the rc from carignan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is very similar to our new measurement ( fig  [ fig1]d ) .",

    "<S> carignan et al . ( 2006 ) recently presented an extended  rotation curve ( rc ) of m31 , using single dish observations from the 100 m effelsberg and green bank telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> these observations were motivated by a comparison with previous  data from braun ( 1991 ) which presented a decreasing rotation curve as a function of radius . </S>",
    "<S> the carignan et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) data were obtained along the semi - major axis of the approaching half of the m31  disk and showed a flat rc at large radius , extending up to @xmath035 kpc ( using @xmath1 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical analysis of m31 is pursued here and new deep 21 cm observations obtained at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) are presented . </S>",
    "<S> a tilted - ring model is fitted to a new  velocity field , allowing the derivation of the position angle @xmath2 and inclination @xmath3 as a function of radius . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the approaching half of the disk in order to compare our new results with those from carignan et al ( 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the disk warping of m31 does not severely contaminate the kinematics of the neutral gas . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the rc from the single dish data is in very good agreement with the newly derived rc . </S>"
