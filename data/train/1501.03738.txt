    "such a diffusive mechanism has been much studied @xcite and leads to a stretched exponential decay @xmath179 .",
    "we have not attempted a direct verification of this behavior of @xmath34 , as it is expected only for very large times , @xmath180 .",
    "we turn now to a study of overlap correlations , which correlate the configuration of the system at time @xmath37 with a configuration drawn from the equilibrium ensemble at time @xmath181 .",
    "studies of such correlations reveal the existence of dynamical heterogeneities in three - dimensional glass - forming liquids .",
    "it is therefore of interest to see whether the system of disks in a channel shows similar behavior .",
    "in particular we shall make use of the ( self ) overlap function @xmath182\\ , , \\label{qdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath183=\\frac{1}{2}({\\operatorname{sign}}(y_i(t ) ) { \\operatorname{sign}}(y_i(0))+1)$ ] is unity if disk @xmath7 is on the same side of the channel at times 0 and @xmath37 , and is zero otherwise ; in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite , this quantity is the _ mobility _ of disk  @xmath7 .",
    "similar overlap functions have been studied in three dimensions : in that case , the overlap @xmath184 $ ] has been taken to be @xmath185 if @xmath186 and zero otherwise  @xcite .",
    "a significant difference between this latter definition and our own is that our overlap function does not depend on the @xmath15-coordinates of disks .",
    "this modification eliminates an effect , specific to our one - dimensional problem , of large fluctuations ( @xmath187 ) in the @xmath15-coordinates of disks .",
    "these fluctuations can cause the overlap between two configurations to be small even in cases where the configurations would be identical , when described in terms of defects in the zigzag arrangement of disks .",
    "a quantity much studied for three - dimensional systems is the four - point susceptibility @xmath36 , which is defined in terms of the variance of @xmath188 via @xmath189 this has been calculated for our one - dimensional system and is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi4 ] . in three dimensions it reaches a maximum on the timescale @xmath23 and subsequently decreases towards zero , but for our system there is no decay back to zero .",
    "this difference between dimensions @xmath190 and @xmath191 has been discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be understood qualitatively as follows . in three dimensions",
    "the self - overlap @xmath192 $ ] becomes small and is likely to remain small once a sphere has escaped from its cage ; it follows that the fluctuations in @xmath188 will also be small for times that are long enough for most of the spheres to have escaped from their cages .",
    "this argument does not apply to our system of disks in a channel because a disk can cross the channel any number of times , so that @xmath183 $ ] is a fluctuating quantity of order unity . for any value of @xmath37 ,",
    "the @xmath58-coordinates of disks are correlated over a range @xmath19 and are approximately independent over larger distances . from this",
    "we expect the contributions to @xmath188 from independent regions of size @xmath19 to be fluctuating quantities of order @xmath193 for times @xmath194 .",
    "if the number of these regions is @xmath195 , we expect @xmath196 which gives @xmath197 for long times .",
    "this result can be refined by using eq .",

    "the system has reached equilibrium , so that @xmath214 then , by using eq .  , one finds the correlation length @xmath215 here @xmath19 is the number of disks for which zigzag order persists .",
    "this dimensionless quantity is calculated from the two largest eigenvalues , @xmath67 and @xmath216 , of the integral equation , using the expression @xmath217 which follows from the spectral representation of correlation functions , discussed for the case of the ising model in sec .",

    "the above studies show that our system has dynamical heterogeneities of the kind expected in the defect - mediated scenario for glassy dynamics  @xcite . in the packing - fraction regime",
    "where the dynamics are activated , most of the disks will be largely frozen except those in the vicinity of a defect .",
    "the spacing between defects is of order @xmath19 which can become very large .",
    "the defects move about and will eventually annihilate with each other .",
    "this happens on the time scale @xmath27 , which is also the time scale on which new pairs of defects are typically nucleated  @xcite .",
    "there are some notable similarities between the behavior of our system of disks in a narrow channel and that found for a fluid of hard spheres in three dimensions . in each of these systems at higher densities the mean - squared displacement of particles",
    "has a plateau that persists up to the characteristic time for the breaking of cages , @xmath26 or @xmath221 .",
    "also , in both systems there is a crossover from non - activated dynamics to activated dynamics as the density increases and caging sets in . in this latter respect ,",
    "the behavior of these systems is distinctly different from that of a hard - sphere crystal with defects , where the particles are always caged and the diffusion of defects will occur via an activated process .",
    "there are , of course , some important differences . in the channel system ,",
    "the growing bond - orientational order that we associate with the caging of disks is clearly visible in the structure factor , and this is not the case for the three - dimensional glass - forming liquids , where higher - order correlation functions are required to reveal bond - orientational order .",
    "the difference here is due to the channel walls , which form part of the cages : their direction is fixed and so constrains the possible directions of the `` bonds '' between nearest - neighbor disks .",
    "this can be seen from the top and bottom diagrams fig .",
    "[ transitionstate ] , where only three nearest - neighbor bond directions are possible at @xmath222 .",
    "another difference appears in the behavior of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath36 , which , for the channel system , does not tend to zero for @xmath223 .",
    "we note , however , that this is the expected behavior of @xmath36 in defect - mediated models of glassy dynamics in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our work strongly supports the common idea @xcite that glass behavior is a consequence of geometry and the local arrangements around the molecules in the supercooled liquid .",
    "our system is sufficiently simple that we can quantitatively relate its dynamical features to structural features .",
    "the three - dimensional problem is much richer and success along these lines is probably only just starting  @xcite .",
    "the caging effects in our system mimic those seen in three dimensions .",
    "these are normally modeled by mode - coupling theory  @xcite and are associated with a genuine dynamical transition , within that approximation .",
    "our system is effectively one dimensional and is unlikely to have a genuine phase transition .",
    "we are skeptical that the features that we see in the dynamics could be explained in any way by mode - coupling arguments .",
    "they seem instead to be more naturally explained by dynamical processes associated with the developing structural order in the system .",
    "we suspect that the same might be true of three - dimensional systems .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the dynamics of our system of disks is the existence of _ two _ long time scales , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in three dimensions ,",
    "only the analogue of @xmath26 , which is the cage - breaking time @xmath221 , is normally discussed .",
    "but in two dimensions a second , much longer , time scale has been revealed in experimental studies of polydisperse colloidal crystals , reported by tanaka and co - workers  @xcite . in their systems",
    "there is a growing lengthscale @xmath19 for bond - orientational order , and their second long timescale @xmath224 is associated with dynamical correlations on that lengthscale .",
    "this is strikingly similar to what we have found for the case of disks in a channel , where the growing lengthscale is that of zigzag ordering , which is a form of bond - orientational order .",
    "it might , of course , be that the second long time scale is a feature of the dynamics only for one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "one would expect two long timescales to exist in three dimensions if escaping the cage could be associated with moving a defect ; the longer time scale would then be associated with the time that the system needs to reach equilibrium via the motion of defects ."
