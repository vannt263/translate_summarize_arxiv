    "since the 1980 s mesoscopic conductors have been serving as an ideal stage to investigate the quantum scattering problem both theoretically and experimentally , because the quantum transport through a single site can be precisely probed in electronic measurement  @xcite .",
    "the landauer - bttiker formalism embodies this advantage of mesoscopic physics , as was successfully applied to the aharonov - bohm ring , the quantum point contact , and the quantum dot , through which the mesoscopic physics has been established [ see fig .",

    "actually , the quantum shot noise measurement was successfully demonstrated , for example , to provide the direct proof of the fractional charge  @xcite and the cooper pair  @xcite by looking at how carriers are scattered at a mesoscopic conductor .",
    "these days the mesoscopic transport is invoking much interest from another point of view . as the electron transport",
    "can be viewed as the electron exchange process between the reservoirs via the conductor as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , it serves as a well - defined test stage for nonequilibrium quantum statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "the unique advantage of this approach lies in that the degree of nonequilibrium can be finely tuned by the bias voltage applied to the conductor .",
    "in addition , many events , namely numerous electron exchange processes , can be monitored , which enables us to perform precise measurement .     and",
    "@xmath2 are the chemical potentials of the left and the right reservoirs , respectively .",
    "mesoscopic transport based on the landauer - bttiker picture is schematically shown . when a conductor is biased , electrons injected from one of the reservoirs are either transmitted or reflected at the conductor , which yields finite current fluctuation [ @xmath3 .",
    "( b ) the transport can be also viewed as the electron exchange process between the two reservoirs . ]    to quantitatively address the above topic , the fluctuation theorem ( ft )  @xcite is believed to play a central role  @xcite . based on microscopic reversibility ( `` microreversibility '' or detailed balance ) , this relation exactly links the probabilities of the production and consumption of the entropy in a given system that is coupled to the reservoir .",
    "ft corresponds to a microscopic expansion of the macroscopic second law of thermodynamics and is proven to yield the linear - response theory  @xcite , and the onsager - casimir relations  @xcite .",

    "we explain ft by using the simplest setup and deduce the aforementioned nonequilibrium fluctuation relations .",
    "we consider a mesoscopic conductor , say a quantum point contact , where the two quantum wires are coupled by tunneling .",

    "as we have seen that @xmath136 deviates from unity , the slope is slightly different from unity .",
    "however , within the accuracy of the present experiment , we may claim that two values are the same .",
    "this tells us that in the present experiment the assumption of the microreversibility is valid .",
    "finally , we note that the present demonstration gives a single example of the validity of the microreversibility in the nonequilibrium quantum regime in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "this fundamental topic should be experimentally addressed in many systems such as electron interferometers  @xcite , the quantum dot  @xcite , and the macroscopic inhomogeneous system  @xcite .",
    "we show that the fluctuation theorem is semiquantitatively valid in the description of the quantum transport in mesoscopic systems . unlike the conventional scattering theory",
    ", this description gives a nontrivial relation between the nonlinearity and the nonequilibrium in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the direct test of the validity of the microreversibility was also addressed .",
    "since the fluctuation theorem does not directly give the physical interpretation of the current through the device as the landauer - bttiker formalism does , both descriptions are complementary to each other .",
