    "x - ray binary systems ( xrbs ) are composed by either a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star , and a normal ( non degenerated ) star which supplies matter to the compact object through the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "some  260 xrbs are known up to now @xcite probably corresponding to an underlying population of some tens of thousands of compact objects in our galaxy .",
    "a few of these sources present also non - thermal radio emission , hence evidencing the existence of mechanism(s ) capable of injecting and/or accelerating large numbers of relativistic particles .",
    "some radio emitting x - ray binary systems ( rexbs ) have been observed showing ejection of material at relativistic velocities and to display jets like those seen in quasars and active galactic nuclei but at @xmath0 times shorter scales .",
    "this analogy is the reason for calling them microquasars ( mqs ) @xcite and making them some of the most interesting objects for astrophysics .",
    "furthermore , attention on these objects has grown since the proposal of paredes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite of mqs as counterparts of some of the unidentified gamma - ray sources of the egret catalog @xcite and hence pointing them as plausible high energy emitters .",
    "a strong confirmation of this association has come from the detections of the mqs ls 5039 and ls i + 61 303 at tev energies using respectively the ground - based cherenkov telescopes hess @xcite and magic @xcite , giving support and empowering at the same time a number of previous detailed studies centered on the mechanisms operating in these sources in order to explain the gamma ray domain ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a jet origin of the emission from mqs has been suggested from the observation of syncrothron emission of relativistic electrons / positrons extending from the radio all the way into the x - ray regime . in this sense jet - like models",
    "have focused on different approaches regarding the particle origin that could generate the required emission properties in a consistent way .",
    "some of them consider leptons directly injected at the base of the jet and , in extending outwards , compton - interaction with external / self - created photon fields produces high energy radiation .",
    "other models deal with an hadronic origin of the high energy emission , through proton - proton interactions and pion decay producing gamma rays and leaving the resulting co - generated leptons as low energy emitters .",
    "the present work refers to the later procedure , focusing on the modelisation of the secondary leptonic synchrotron emission in order to constrain the characterization of mq jets .",
    "an outline of the model is given in the next , followed by the results showing the seds and lightcurves under different parameter assumptions and the conclusions that can be extracted from them .",
    "we have taken a binary system formed by a black hole and a high - mass early - type star which feeds the accretion transfer of mass onto the compact object while developing an accretion disk .",
    "part of the accretion power is converted to kinetic and magnetic energy of the accretion flow under the effects of the compact object potential well and a relativistic @xmath1-@xmath2 plasma is ejected in a direction taken to be perpendicular to the plane defined by the accretion disk .",
    "this plane is the same as the orbital one , even if this condition can be relaxed to allow a more general situation but for simplicity we assume coplanarity in our model .",
    "jet energetics is assumed to be dominated by accretion , and further energy sources like compact object rotation have been neglected at this stage .",
    "the jet will also contain a magnetic field @xmath3 associated with the plasma .",
    "we assume that the matter kinetic luminosity is higher than the magnetic luminosity ( or total magnetic energy crossing the jet section per time unit ) in the jet regions we are concerned with , although the magnetic field can be still significant once the jet is formed , since the ejection mechanism have likely a magneto - hydrodynamical origin .",
    "in this scenario we deal with radiative processes that take place in the jet and can produce significant emission in the radio spectrum . although the contribution of protons could still be significant from the radiative point of view , we will focus on the leptonic component only .",
    "the reader is related to other works ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) for treatments on primary hadrons .",

    "synchrotron loses will be enhanced when taking higher values for @xmath63 but , since injection occurs all along the jet inside the bynary system ( until a distance roughly given by @xmath64 cm ) , the enhancement in the final emission will preval over losses . here",

    "the resulting emission will be isotropic in the jet reference frame ; to compute the expected luminosity , we have used the formulae presented in @xcite , where expressions for the specific emission and absorption coefficients are given by    @xmath48    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath48    with the function f(x ) given by @xmath72 being @xmath73 the modified second kind bessel functions , @xmath74 where @xmath75 hz is the critical frequency , and the constant @xmath76 ( in cgs units ) .",

    "leptons are injected in the context of hadronic secondaries generation within a detailed model that takes into account in a consistent way particle injection mechanisms and cooling due to radiation processes and adiabatic expansion .",
    "the luminosities obtained are slightly lower than in the models based on primary leptons injection , and must be considered complementary to them .",
    "however , we note that within our model there is no requirements of acceleration processes along the jet to obtain the final emission results .",
    "such acceleration processes are still not well understood , although .",
    "they could come from diffusive shock acceleration along the jet when fresh ejecta interact with previous blobs of plasma already outflowing at lower velocities .",
    "other scenarios assume a continuous energy transfer mechanism from the magnetic field to the matter content of the jet in such a way that the resulting parsec - scale radio emission can be explained .",
    "the fact of studying alternative models were particles are directly injected until a certain height along the jet can constrain the amount of acceleration required and contribute to the understanding of the physical mechanisms that can lead to such processes .",
    "signatures at different distances along the jet and specific spectral features detectable for reasonable parameter values treated in our numerical simulations have the potential to be an important clue for determining the matter content of jets . in particluar ,",
    "highly resolved observations at 1 and 5 ghz could determine if leptons are present at heights @xmath81 cm at the edge of the binary system typical region where wind matter from the companion is still significant .",
    "if electrons / positrons still show high energies due to a recent injection from hadronic interactions at these parts of the jet , it could be a signature of secondary generation without the necessity of invoking additional acceleration processes .",
