    "the thermal gas in outer regions of the cluster has a relatively smooth and symmetric surface brightness distribution , while the inner regions often reveal peaked x - ray emission which is generally interpreted as a cooling flow ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "the thermal gas in the central regions of these cooling flow clusters has a radiative cooling time which is significantly shorter than the hubble time , leading to mass deposition rates of more than 100 @xmath7 yr@xmath4 being determined from imaging data from @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "analysis of asca sis and gis data suggested much lower inferred cooling rates ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and more recently , high - resolution spatially resolved spectral fitting of @xmath0 and @xmath10 data have revealed cooling rates that are a factor of a few to ten times lower than those obtained from the imaging analysis ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "further evidence of lower cooling flow rates comes from observations using xmm s reflection - grating spectrometer which finds no evidence of cool gas in cluster cores below approximately one - third of the ambient cluster temperature ( e.g. , peterson et al .",

    "our fits showed that the addition of a systematic error term of 3% to the data allowed us to retain the majority of the spectral region in the fits .",

    "2.5truein    0.1truein    our initial spectral fitting of the central region of abell 2029 used the single temperature mekal plasma emission code @xcite to fit the spectrum in the energy range of @xmath24 kev . fixing the absorption to the galactic value of @xmath28 @xmath29 as determined from @xcite results in a reduced @xmath30 of 1.23 , and yields a temperature of @xmath31 kev and an abundance of @xmath32 times solar ( assuming metallicity of * ? ? ?",
    "given the relatively poor quality of this fit , we have allowed the absorption to be a free parameter and find that the resulting model is somewhat improved ( reduced @xmath30 = 1.18 ) , but this fit requires the absorption column to fall below galactic which may be unlikely .",
    "it is more likely that this fit indicates that there is an additional soft x - ray emission component ( eg .  a second low temperature thermal component ) which is not modeled by a single temperature , and/or",
    "the qe degradation correction may not be exact .",
    "the spectral fits are improved ( at @xmath33 99.9 % level according to the f - test ) by adding a second mekal component to the model . in this model",
    ", the abundances of the two mekal components are tied together as there is not enough information in the spectrum to accurately fit them individually .",
    "for the two temperature fit with absorption fixed to galactic , we find a reduced @xmath30 of 1.18 .",
    "the best fitting high and low temperatures are @xmath34 kev and @xmath35 kev , and the abundance is @xmath36 times solar .",
    "the emission measures ( mekal normalization parameter k ) of the hot and cold components are within a factor of about two of each other ( @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath38 ) .",
    "our metallicity results are in good agreement with @xcite and the @xmath40 results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this best - fit two - temperature model is shown in figure  [ , temperatures and abundance to within the 90% confidence errors , and only slightly lower than galactic absorption of @xmath41 @xmath29 .",
    "we find that the temperatures of the hot and cool components of the two mekal fits differ by more than a factor of 50 .",
    "one possible explanation for the soft emission component in abell 2029 is emission from filaments of warm - hot intergalactic medium surrounding the cluster .",
    "@xcite have recently studied a sample of 14 clusters using @xmath10-@xmath42 data and find evidence for a spatially extended soft component in the spectrum of five clusters .",
    "they find that the emission measure of the soft excess is limited to roughly 10% of that of the hot gas component in the central regions of the clusters but increases significantly to the outer regions of the clusters , where the soft excess becomes dominant in three of the clusters .",
    "the small field of view of the acis - s3 ccd does not allow us to examine the soft component beyond the central regions of the cluster .",
    "we note , however , that the emission measure of the soft component in abell 2029 is a much larger percentage ( roughly 50% ) of that of the hot component .",
    "this much larger central concentration in abell 2029 suggests that the emission is not primarily due to intercluster filaments .",
    "we have considered the effects of uncertainties in the @xmath0 calibration and the galactic absorbing column on the spectral fits since both could have an impact on the fitted soft x - ray component .",
    "the observations were taken early in the @xmath0 mission , thus the effects of the qe degradation uncertainty are small . to further limit any uncertainties from calibration problems at low energies",
    "we have restricted our spectral analysis to energies above 0.7 kev .",
    "in the case of m87 , high resolution observations showed galactic columns were roughly 28% lower toward the cluster center @xcite than those determined by the lower spatial resolution observations of @xcite .",
    "we have examined the range of @xmath43 measurements from @xcite in the vicinity of abell 2029 and find that they vary by at most 12% from the galactic column used above . fitting the spectra with a 12% ( or even 30% ) lower galactic column does not change the spectral results within the 90% confidence interval .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the soft emission seen in abell 2029 is a result of either a calibration error or a variation in the galactic column .",
    "given the indications that the cluster has cool gas in the core , and the past high cooling flow rates of @xmath44 determined for abell 2029 , we have also investigated a cooling flow model for the core .",
    "the spectral fits used the mkcflow model in conjunction with a mekal model such that the high temperature component ( @xmath45 ) of the cooling flow model is tied to the temperature of the mekal model .",
    "the mekal model represents the hot outer cluster gas along the line of sight .",
    "we assume that the cooling flow material cooled from this ambient cluster gas , and thus we fix the abundance in mkcflow to that of the mekal model for the ambient cluster gas . when the absorption was fixed to galactic , the mekal + mkcflow model had best fit high and low temperatures of @xmath46 kev and @xmath47 kev , an abundance of @xmath48 times solar , and a mass deposition rate of @xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( reduced @xmath30 = 1.19 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath49 is consistent with zero and the best - fit value is well below the lowest photon energies in the spectrum ; thus , this fit represents gas which is cooling down to very low temperatures .",
    "the data are not sufficient to constrain the mekal + mkcflow model with the absorbing column , metallicity , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and cooling flow rates free .",
    "we have therefore fixed the lower temperature component in the cooling flow model to 0.08 kev based on the results from the mekal fits .",
    "the subsequent mekal + mkcflow fits have reduced @xmath30 = 1.18 , a mass deposition rate of zero and an ( unlikely ) absorbing column @xmath11 4 times lower than galactic .",
    "the upper and lower ranges of the temperature distribution spanned by the cooling flow model are consistent with the hot and cool components of the two temperature fits .",
    "this cooling flow temperature range of @xmath52 is far greater than seen for other clusters @xcite , and is discussed further in ",
    "[ sect : disc ] .",
    "we have also considered an annulus centered on the cluster core running from the cooling radius out to the edge of the s3 chip ( i.e.116  to 174 , or 167 to 251 kpc ) .",
    "we have extracted the spectrum for this region and examined both single and two temperature mekal models as well as the mekal + mkcflow model .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in table  [ tbl : outer ] .",
    "as with the cooling radius fits , we find that the two temperature model and the mekal + mkcflow provide better fits than the single temperature model ( i.e.  @xmath30/d.o.f.@xmath53 = 436/343 , @xmath30/d.o.f.@xmath54=399/341 , and @xmath30/d.o.f.@xmath55=406/341 ) .",
    "the high temperature component from the best fit models in this outer annulus is somewhat higher than that for the cooling core , consistent with the radial temperature increase found by @xcite .",
    "the low temperature component remains around 0.1 kev indicating that the cool gas continues to radii of at least 250 kpc from the core of abell 2029 .",
    "the multi - temperature gas and moderate cooling rate we have found for the spectral fits to the @xmath0 data of abell 2029 are in a possible conflict with the analysis of @xcite who found no evidence of multiphase gas in the cluster .",
    "the spectral fits undertaken by @xcite covered the energy range of @xmath56 kev but did not include the ( then unknown ) correction for the qe degradation at soft energies . without the qe correction , the spectral models would over - predict the flux at low energies thus resulting in weaker constraints on a cool spectral component .",
    "the discrepancy between our multi - temperature fits and those of @xcite are likely due in part to the improved calibration at low energies provided by caldb v2.26 as well as our restriction to energies above 0.7 kev .",
    "we note also that the multiphase and cooling flow models of @xcite were only applied to each of their inner three annuli which cover radii @xmath57 30 , while our models were applied to a single region out to the cooling radius of 116 .",
    "based on the models we examined , we find that the best fit is produced by the two - temperature mekal model where the cluster gas has @xmath1 kev and @xmath2 kev ( table  [ tbl : xspec ] ) .",
    "this fit is only slightly better than the mekal + mkcflow model with absorption fixed to galactic where we find gas cooling over a range of temperatures between 7.94 kev and 0.08 kev , and a mass deposition rate of @xmath58 yr@xmath4 .",

    "based on spectral fits to the region , we estimate a total mass of the spiral excess of @xmath99 , although this should be considered a lower limit due to uncertainties in the size and location of the region .",
    "it seems likely that the excess feature may be the result of stripping of gas from a galaxy group or gas trapped in a dark matter potential .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the excess is the result of sloshing of the cluster core due to a past cluster merger",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possible explanation for the wat morphology is that the mechanism responsible for producing the x - ray spiral excess has also influenced the radio source structure . the tip of the southern radio jet of pks 1508 + 059 bends toward the south at roughly the location where it intersects ( in projection ) with the inner regions of the x - ray excess .",
    "in addition , the southern radio lobe is displaced ( again in projection ) to the west of the minor axis of the x - ray emission .",
    "if the emission is due to a buoyantly rising detached radio lobe we would expect it to follow the steepest x - ray pressure gradient which should be along the minor axis . in comparison ,",
    "the northern outer lobe , which is apparently unaffected by the spiral excess , appears to be roughly directed along the minor axis .",
    "the southern radio lobe is traced on the western side by a bright x - ray filament which may be a partial shell similar to that seen for hydra a @xcite .",
    "the temperature map of the central cluster region shows that the gas surrounding the southern radio lobe is cool , consistent with the results found for the bright rims around radio bubbles in clusters such as perseus @xcite and abell 2052 @xcite .",
    "we will combine the 19 ksec archival data with our deeper 80 ksec cycle 5 data set to examine the region of the radio foot in more detail to determine if there is a complete rim .",

    "the range of temperatures from the cooling flow model is more than a factor of 50 between the hot and cool components .",

    "this limit is lower than the 56 @xmath120 we determine to be cooling through @xmath121 k based on the @xmath0 data .",

    "abell 2029 may be a very young cooling core cluster where the gas has only recently started ( or re - started ) cooling to low temperatures .",
    "in this scenario , the radio source may have only recently re - started as a result of feeding from the cooling flow , and thus feedback mechanisms may not have had time to suppress the cooling to low temperatures .",
    "the cooling flow may have only existed for a short time , and too little gas has cooled to low temperatures to produce optical emission lines or star formation .",
    "one concern with this feedback scenario is that gas must have cooled and reached the central black hole in order to produce the current radio core .",
    "it may be that gas in abell 2029 is presently cooling for the first time ; alternatively , a previous cooling episode may have been disrupted by a merger or heated by the central agn activity .",
    "the presence of the spiral excess feature may suggest that abell 2029 has had a minor merger in the not too distant past , and numerical simulations by @xcite indicate that mergers can lead to the disruption of cooling flows in clusters .",
    "one argument against a recent merger or hydrodynamical disruption of the core of abell 2029 is the strong increase in the fe abundance in the cluster core seen by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that mergers or other processes which disrupt the cooling core might also mix the gas and hence eliminate such abundance gradients . in the case of the minor merger in abell 2029 ,",
    "the core may not have been significantly disrupted and/or the infalling material may have had an enriched metallicity which could contribute to the observed enhancement .",
    "unfortunately spectral fits to the current data do not provide useful limits on the metallicity of the excess material relative to that of the ambient gas .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the onset of cooling was delayed by an agn heating process which did not mix the cluster - center gas .",

    "@xcite fit the cooling flow model individually to each of the inner three annuli ( roughly inner 35 kpc ) .",

    "@xcite used the @xmath0 data to measure the density and temperature distribution in abell 2029 down to the inner 3 .",
    "based on the apparent lack of both multiphase gas and significant x - ray structure they used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to determine the distribution of total mass with radius in the system . fitting the mass profile to various models they found that the distribution was well fit by the @xcite ( nfw ) profile over the range of radii between 5 and 260 kpc .",
    "the lack of deviations of their data from the nfw profile led @xcite to conclude that the flattened dark matter profile predicted for self - interacting dm @xcite was inconsistent with the abell 2029 data .",
    "the presence of significant x - ray structure and multiphase gas that we find within the central 130 kpc indicates that the central regions of the cluster are not fully in hydrostatic equilibrium . without detailed numerical simulations of this system , it is difficult to say at what level the departure from hydrostatic equilibrium has influenced the @xcite fits to the mass profile .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of @xmath0 observations of the central regions of the cooling flow cluster abell 2029 . we find a number of x - ray filaments in the central 40 kpc , some of which appear to be associated with the currently active central radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the outer southern lobe of the steep - spectrum radio source appears to be surrounded by a region of cool gas and is at least partially surrounded by a bright x - ray rim similar to that seen around radio sources in the cores of other cooling flow clusters . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic fits show that the overall cluster emission is best fitted by either a two temperature gas ( @xmath1 kev , @xmath2 kev ) , or a cooling flow model with gas cooling over the same temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> this large range of temperatures ( over a factor of 50 ) is relatively unique to abell 2029 and may suggest that this system is a very young cooling flow where the gas has only recently started cooling to low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling flow model gives a mass deposition rate of @xmath3 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the cluster emission is elongated along a position angle of 22  with an ellipticity of 0.26 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the x - ray emission in the central region of the cluster is asymmetric , however , with excess emission to the north - east and south - east compared to the south - west and north - west , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> fitting and subtracting a smooth elliptical model from the x - ray data reveals a dipolar spiral excess extending in a clockwise direction from the cluster core to radii of @xmath5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a total mass of @xmath6 in the spiral excess </S>",
    "<S> . the most likely origins of the excess are either stripping of gas from a galaxy group or bare dark matter potential which has fallen into the cluster , or sloshing motions in the cluster core induced by a past merger . </S>"
