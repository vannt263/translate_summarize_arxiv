    "the galactic micro - quasar ss 433 is an enigmatic x - ray binary system , ejecting material in the form of bipolar jets with almost constant velocity ( @xmath5 ) ( margon 1984 ; gies et al .",
    "2002 ) . even after @xmath6 years of its discovery ,",
    "it is not clear whether the compact object is a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the nature of the companion is also not known with certainly .",
    "recently , gies et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out from their uv spectroscopic study of the mass donour star of ss 433 that the nature of the companion is probably an evolved a - type star with a black hole as the primary .",
    "the disk , along with the jet which is along the instantaneous normal to it , itself precesses with a @xmath7 day periodicity .",
    "the binary has a @xmath8 day periodicity ( margon 1984 ) .",
    "there are observational supports in optical as well as in radio / ir / x - rays ( borisov & fabrika , 1987 ; vermeulen et al .",
    "1993ab ; chakrabarti et al . 2002 , 2003",
    "; migliari , fender and mndez , 2002 ) support that the jets are ejected in a bullet - like fashion , i.e. , as blobs ejected along the instantaneous axis of the disk having only the _ radial velocity component_. the red / blue shifts of the lines emitted from these jets are described very accurately by the so - called kinematic model of abell & margon ( 1979 ) .",
    "these blobs in radio / x - ray are seen within a few arcseconds from the core , although radio emissions and x - rays are also present much farther out , in the scale of half a degree ( e.g. , margon , 1984 ; migliari , fender & mendz , 2002 ) .",
    "although extensive optical and radio monitoring of the source has provided the basic parameters to describe the disk - jet system , there are very few observation in x - rays . in x - rays , ss 433 is a relatively weak source and is not generally observable in hard x - rays beyond @xmath9 kev .",
    "previous observations by exosat , ginga , asca confirmed the existence of the doppler - shifted x - ray emission lines ( watson et al . 1986 ; yuan et al .",
    "1995 ; kotani et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the shifting of the fe - line was found to be consistent with the predictions of the kinematic model .",
    "this therefore indicated that the x - ray emitting material is physically associated with the jets .",
    "recently , the chandra observation of ss 433 spectrum ( marshall et al .",
    "2002 , namiki et al .",
    "2003 ) shows very much complex behaviour with a large number of blue and red shifted lines .",
    "kinematic model was also established , but higher velocity was required for the line emitting gases .",
    "iron line emission from the extended region of the jet has also been observed by chandra ( migliari , fender and mndez , 2002 ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report results obtained using the rxte satellite , compiling archival data as well as too data triggered by us .",
    "most importantly , for the first time , the spectrum obtained during ( a ) the _ inferior conjunction _ ( when the central compact object and the base of the jet is blocked exactly by the companion ; i.e. , the orbital phase @xmath0 ) _ and _ at the same time , when the precessional phase , @xmath10 was also @xmath11 and ( b ) the _ superior conjunction _ ( when the companion is hidden by the disk and the jet is completely exposed to us , i.e. , the orbital phase @xmath1 ) _ and _ at the same time , when the precessional phase , @xmath10 was also @xmath11 are presented and analyzed . in these special days , the jet was directly pointing towards us emitting lines with the highest possible line shifts .",
    "these data were obtained on oct .",
    "2nd , 2003 and on mar .",
    "13th , 2004 .",
    "because of lower energy resolution of rxte / pca instrument ( @xmath12% at @xmath13kev ) , it is not often easy to identify the exact source of the lines and line flux would also be inaccurate due to blending with other lines . fortunately comparing results with the earlier observations by asca ( kotani et al .",
    "1996 ) and chandra ( marshall et al .",
    "2002 , namiki et al . 2003 ) the identification became easier .",
    "in the next section , we present the tables containing a log of observations analysed by us and the results of our analysis . we also present the light curves of some of these observations . in section 3 ,",
    "we present fits of the spectrum obtained by us at three epochs , including the ones at the inferior and the superior conjunctions .",
    "we also show how the line energy ( including red / blue shifts ) match with the shifts predicted from the kinematic model . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the possibility of x - ray flares in this system .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "ss 433 was pointed at several times by proportional counter array ( pca ) detectors on board rxte satellite .",
    "the pca contains five ( @xmath11 @xmath14 @xmath15 ) proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",
    "we concentrate on observations taken since november , 2001 . in order to avoid biasing the analysis",
    ", we selected only those observations which were taken by the same units of pca detector , namely , @xmath16 & @xmath17 .",
    "we made the analysis by adding data from these two pcus together .",
    "a log of these observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the first column gives the log of observation and the second column gives the date and time when the observation begins ( in mjd ) along with the rxte observation i d . to calculate the precessional phase ( @xmath10 ) and orbital phase ( @xmath18 ) , at the begining time of these observations , we adopt the following ephemeris ( goranskii et al . 1998 ) : hjd @xmath19e for @xmath10 and hjd @xmath20e for @xmath18 .",
    "these are given in column 3 .",
    "observations i ( made on oct .",
    "2nd , 2003 ) and observation k ( made on mar .",
    "13th , 2004 ) had @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively both having @xmath23 .",
    "too observations g - l were triggered at our request .",
    "a recent too data ( observation m made on 25th of march , 2004 ) is also included .",
    "we also re - analysed the archival data of nov .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) and iron line(s ) and the temperature is given in column 4 ( see next section for details of the fitting procedure . )",
    "the total integrated flux of x - rays in @xmath24kev range in units of @xmath25ergs @xmath26 sec@xmath27 is presented in column 5 . during the recent superior conjunction when the jet was exposed to us ( march 13th , 2004 ) , the net flux was found to be more than twice as high compared to that in the inferior conjunction ( oct .",
    "2nd , 2003 ) .",
    "the net flux remained high for at least another orbital period indicating that ss 433 may be undergoing a weak flaring activity .",
    "one can compare the x - ray flux by rxte observations with earlier results of exosat ( watson et al .",
    "1986 ) and chandra ( namiki et al . 2003 ) .",
    "for instance , in the same unit as in table 1 , at @xmath23 , the 2 - 6kev flux of exosat was @xmath28 while our fluxes vary from @xmath29 depending on @xmath18 in the same range of 2 - 6kev .",
    "chandra , on the other hand , found the total integrated flux in 1 - 10kev at @xmath30 to be @xmath31 .",
    "we did not make any observation at this phase , and our result at phase @xmath23 in @xmath32kev is @xmath33 .",
    "thus the fluxes measured by rxte are comparable to previous measurements , although an actual comparison requires observation to be carried out at the same precessional and orbital phases as well .",
    "according to the kinematic model ( abell & margon , 1979 ; margon 1984 ) , the red / blue shifts @xmath34 of the emitted line are computed from : @xmath35 where , @xmath36 ( taken here to be @xmath37 , see , gies et al .",
    "2002 ) is the proper velocity of the line emission in units of velocity of light @xmath38 from the jet matter , @xmath39 is the angle that the normal to the disk subtends with the line of sight , @xmath40 is the angle subtended by the jet with the disk - normal , @xmath10 is the precession phase taken from table 1 . in this convention",
    ", a negative @xmath34 corresponds to blue - shifts and a positive @xmath34 corresponds to red - shifts . note that we use the definition of @xmath10 such that @xmath41 when the shifts of the blue and red - jets are maximally different as in margon ( 1984 ) . in table 2 , we presented these values in column 2 . the significance of the columns @xmath17-@xmath42 will be discussed in the next section .",

    "this behaviour persisted even after one orbital period ( observation m ) .",
    "columns 7 and 8 give the line width ( kev ) and line strength ( in units of photons @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) respectively for each line .",
    "it has been noted earlier ( kotani et al .",
    "1996 , marshall et al .",
    "2002 , namiki et al .",
    "2003 ) from the asca and chandra observations that the fexxv lines are on an average 2 - 3 times ( or more ) stronger compared to fexxvi lines . in our rxte observations c , d and f ( when @xmath192 ) , we find roughly a similar result when we identify both the lines to come from the approaching jet components .",
    "however , in observations b and g , where the lines were similarly identified as above , the fexxv line is found to be weaker compared to the fexxvi line . in observations",
    "h - m the jets are pointing towards the observer ( @xmath2 ) and we find that two lines are roughly agreeing with the prediction of the kinematic model provided the line with higher energy ( brighter component ) is identified with fexxvi of the approaching jet and the lower energy ( dimmer component ) is identified with fexxv of the receding jet . in observation",
    "e , we could fit with only one line , possibly because of certain disturbances of the inner disk and the jet one day ahead of the massive radio flare reported by safi - harb & kotani ( 2003 ) .",
    "it is pertinent to ask whether one could have fitted the spectra with one fe line and multiple tb components instead of the way we fitted so far ( single tb with two fe lines ) .",
    "we have tried this for the thin fe line occurring at low energy and found that the fit is deteriorated .",
    "for instance , for observation k , we replaced the fe line of @xmath193kev by the tb of plasma electron temperature @xmath187kev and @xmath194kev respectively ( these temperatures were chosen in a way that the low energy cut - off is at around @xmath13 kev . ) and we found the reduced @xmath59 to be @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively .",
    "however , with two fe lines , the reduced @xmath59 is @xmath197 ( see , table 2 ) .",

    "1 ) of the jet component pointing towards us and the component pointing away from us respectively . though the poor resolution in rxte / pca detector may be the main cause of the deviation of the fitted shifts from that of the kinematic model",
    ", one can assume that the lines energies are correct in order to estimate the possible variation of jet velocity , if any , which may be responsible for this deviation , when other system parameters are kept unchanged .",
    "we plot the short and long - dashed curves in figs .",
    "6(a - b ) for @xmath208 and @xmath209 respectively which are @xmath42% away from the velocity @xmath210 of the standard model .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the intrinsic red - shifts for these velocities .",
    "since at @xmath23 , the blue jet seems to have a large scattering of velocity , while the red jet seems to have a higher velocity , we could not conclude with certainly if the jets have truly different velocity than that of the standard kinematic model ( e.g. , eikenberry et al .",
    "2001 ) , even though there are reports ( e.g. , marshall et al . 2002 ) that the jet velocity could be higher close to the compact object .",
    "we also examined if the lines could be fitted with nixxvii ( 1s2p - 1s@xmath4 transition at @xmath211 kev ) .",
    "however , except for the lower energy component of observation f , none seems to be satisfactory .",
    "it may be noted that near @xmath23 , rxte observation showed the evidence of both the components of the jet which has not been reported before .",
    "during the recent too campaign of 12 - 14th march , 2004 , the x - ray flux is found to be very high .",
    "this may indicate that ss 433 was undergoing some kind of weak x - ray ` flare ' . in order to search of past history of flares",

    "this shows that there had been a few occurrences of ` flaring ' activities in the past , some weak and some strong . in fig .",
    "7b , we folded the asm light curve around @xmath212 days of interval and taken the mean count along with standard deviation as the error bars to indicate that there are indeed some indication of periodicity .",
    "however , the folding looks similar even when @xmath213 is changed by @xmath214 days indicating that this might be an annual event related to asm observation .",
    "while there are at least two other weaker peaks with this periodicity , they do not appear to be very significant at this stage .",

    "1996 till nov .",
    "26th , 2004 . for clarity",
    ", we plotted only those points when the count over the background rate is positive .",
    "we superpose ( with a shift of @xmath16/s along y - axis ) the mean light - curve when folded around @xmath215 days to show the periodic nature of a ` flare ' which repeats after every @xmath215 days interval .",
    "this could be an artefact of the asm obseration .",
    "( b ) average asm light curve obtained by folding around @xmath215days showing the presence of the ` flare ' .",
    "in the present paper , we analyzed a set of rxte observations of ss 433 some of which were triggered by us .",
    "we presented the results of opportune moments at inferior ( @xmath49 ) and superior ( @xmath22 ) conjunctions when the jets had the highest possible doppler shifts ( @xmath2 ; observations i and k respectively ) .",
    "we observed a considerable change in the emitted flux .",
    "in particular , we observed a very high flux ( more than twice the average flux seen in other days ) in observations j , k , l and m , the last one being taken one orbital period later than the previous one .",
    "we did not find any evidence of any short time - scale quasi - periodicity in the pca light curves except perhaps a modulation at around @xmath216 level in time - scales of a few minutes , especially when the companion blocked the base of the jet .",
    "it may be due to the oscillation of the atmosphere of the companion . during the superior conjunction the source was highly variable in a very short time - scale @xmath217s .",
    "the spectra were best fitted with a model consisting of thermal bremsstrahlung component and emission lines .",
    "no signature of any keplerian disk was found , possibly because of the obscuration of the inner part by matter gathered from the mass - loss of the companion .",
    "we generally found that two lines were required to fit the spectrum .",
    "the higher energy lines were generally identified with blue - shifted fexxvi .",
    "the lower energy lines were generally identified with fexxv blue - shifted or red - shifted depending on the precessional phases .",
    "since rxte / pca detectors have poor energy resolution ( @xmath218% at @xmath13kev ) compared to asca and chandra , we could not be sure if the deviation of the doppler - shifts from the value predicted by the kinematic model is solely due to deviation from the standard jet - parameters , i.e. , the velocity and orientation angles .",
    "it is possible that the jet velocity may be different ( as inferred by marshall et al .",
    "2002 using chandra observation ) or there could be some effects due to the nodding motion which we did not include in our fitting . furthermore , the neutral fe line at @xmath219 can also contribute to the flux ( kotani et al .",
    "1996 , marshall et al .",
    "2002 ) we observed that on oct .",
    "2nd , 2003 , the x - ray flux is lower ( less than @xmath42% ) compared to that observed on oct .",
    "1st , 2003 , only twelve hours earlier .",
    "this could be an indication that the x - ray source is progressively blocked by the companion at the conjunction is reached .",
    "similarly , on march 13th , 2004 ( observation k ) the exposed jet was more than twice as bright and this trend continued even after one orbital period ( observation m ) .",
    "these may also indicate that the base of the jet is perhaps the major source of x - rays in ss 433 .    from the asm data we identified some ` flaring ' phenomena in ss 433 .",
    "however , judging from the fact that the periodicity is @xmath220yr , it is possible that this is an artefact of the observation .",
    "there were smaller and weaker flares in asm as well . in any case",
    ", we did observe very high flux in our march , 2004 observation , so real flares do seem to take place in ss433 .",
