    "accreting black - hole candidates ( bhc ) in x - ray binaries show three source states that are distinguished by characteristic spectral and ( correlated ) fast - variability properties .",
    "they are called the low state , high state and very high state ; the dominant parameter that determines the source state is likely to be the mass accretion rate ( see van der klis @xcite , and tanaka & lewin @xcite for recent reviews ) .    in the low state",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a very hard power law component extending to several hundreds of kev .",
    "the source intensity shows strong fluctuations , with broad - band r.m.s .",
    "amplitudes as high as 40 percent . at frequencies above @xmath0 hz the power density spectrum ( pds ) of these variations follows a power law ; at frequencies below a low - frequency cut off the pds is flat . in several",
    "bhc the cut - off frequency @xmath1 has been observed to vary by up to an order of magnitude , while the high - frequency part of the pds remained approximately constant ( belloni & hasinger @xcite ; miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the power integrated over a frequency range below @xmath1 is strongly anti - correlated with that cut - off frequency .    in the high state",
    "the x - ray spectrum contains an ultra - soft thermal component , with ( bremsstrahlung ) temperatures of order 1 kev . in some sources ( e.g. , lmc  x-3 ,",
    "see tanaka @xcite ) the power - law spectral component is not detected , but in others ( e.g. , gs  1124@xmath268 , see ebisawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) it is observed in combination with the ultra - soft component . in the 110 kev range the amplitude of the intensity variations",
    "is correlated with photon energy ; this can be understood if the variability is connected with the power law spectral component , which is diluted by the much lower variability of the ultrasoft emission ( van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "in the very high state the pds of bhc show 310 hz quasi - periodic oscillations and branch structure in an x - ray color - color diagram reminiscent of the normal - branch ( nb ) state of z sources ( van der klis @xcite ) , i.e. , accreting neutron stars with magnetic fields of order @xmath3  g. in view of the strong arguments that the accretion rate of z sources is then close to the eddington limit it has been suggested that in the very high state the bhc are likewise accreting near the eddington limit ( van der klis @xcite ) .    in their low state",
    "the bhc are remarkably similar to atoll sources , i.e. , accreting neutron stars with magnetic field strengths generally believed to be below @xmath4  g ( substantially weaker than those of z sources ) . at low accretion rates , i.e. , in their so - called island state , atoll sources have power law x - ray spectra ( see , e.g. , barret & vedrenne @xcite ) . on average ,",
    "these spectra appear to be not quite as hard as those of low - state bhc ( see , e.g. , gilfanov et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , the distribution of the spectral slopes of bhc and atoll sources shows clear overlap ( wilson et al .",
    "@xcite ; ebisawa et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also van paradijs & van der klis @xcite ) . also , the pds of island - state atoll sources are very similar to those of low - state bhc .",
    "they follow a power law at high frequencies , and are flat below a cut - off frequency ; the high - frequency part of the pds of the atoll source 1608@xmath2522 was observed to remain approximately constant as the cut - off frequency varied , like for cyg x-1 ( yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    as part of our attempt to gain a better understanding of the similarities between accreting bhc and neutron stars we are studying the variability of bright bhc using the almost continuous record provided by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "we here report on a variability record of , covering approximately 1100 days , and we show that the amplitude of its variations are strongly correlated with the slope of the hard x - ray spectrum , and that correlations exist between the amplitude of the variations and the total flux .",
    "to quantify the rapid variability , we have created pds from the 1.024 second time resolution large area detector ( lad ) count rate data , ( the so - called discla data ) using two energy channels covering the range 2050 and 50100 kev .",
    "these data were filtered to eliminate bursts , earth magnetospheric events , etc . , then searched for data segments of 512 contiguous time bins ( 524.288 seconds without gaps ) when the source was above the earth s limb . during outburst of the bright transients",
    "gro  j0422 + 32 and gro  j1719@xmath224 the data from detectors that had these sources in their fields of view were eliminated from consideration . on average , we selected 40 intervals of these 512-bin data strings per day , amounting to a total data set of @xmath5 seconds .",
    "the data for each detector and each energy channel were individually fit to a quadratic polynomial and the fit residuals converted to fourier amplitudes using standard fast fourier transform techniques . using similar 524.288 second intervals obtained when",
    "the source was occulted by the earth , we have determined that the quadratic detrending of the raw data yields a background ( source occulted ) power level that is flat between 0.01  hz and the nyquist frequency ( 0.488 hz ) .",
    "the power level in these background data is very close to poissonian ; using the normalization of leahy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in which poisson noise corresponds to a power density 2.0 , the background power density level equals @xmath6 .",
    "this latter value has been subtracted from the data , so that these corrected data reflects the contribution to the pds from cyg x-1 only .",
    "deadtime corrections are not important for the count rate data used here .",
    "the fourier transforms of each data segment were then summed coherently and converted to pds .",
    "we made daily averages of these pds over all segments selected for that day .",
    "after subtraction of the average background noise level these were normalized to the squared fractional  amplitude per unit frequency ( van der klis @xcite ) using the daily averaged detector count rates in the 20100 kev energy band obtained from the batse occultation analysis ( harmon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as a measure of the variability of the hard x - ray flux of cyg",
    "x-1 we used the fractional  amplitude , @xmath7 , of the intensity fluctuations in the frequency range , obtained by integrating the power spectral density ( van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "from their investigation of the 125 kev variability of cyg  x-1 belloni and hasinger ( 1990 ) found that the cut - off frequency @xmath1 in the pds varies between 0.01 and 0.1 hz ; since the high - frequency part of the pds remains constant , the cut - off frequency is anti - correlated with the power level at , and below , that frequency .",
    "crary et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have confirmed this result for the 20100 kev range using the data discussed here .",
    "we have searched for a possible correlation of the variability of cyg  x-1 , and its hard x - ray intensity and spectral shape .",
    "the latter quantities were obtained from the 45140 kev x - ray light curve of , which has been monitored with batse since the beginning of the cgro mission ( paciesas et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the 45140 kev flux , @xmath8 , is generally between 0.07 and 0.15 @xmath9 , with no prominent long term ( @xmath10 50 day ) trends in the data evident through most of this period . at about truncated julian day",
    "( tjd = jd @xmath2 2440000.5 ) 9250 ( 1993",
    "september 20 ) , the source flux gradually declined over a period of about 150 days to a level of @xmath11 .",
    "after that , the flux rose within 30 days , back to a level of approximately 0.1 @xmath9 .",
    "although it is not possible , on the basis of batse observations alone , to determine the source state of  during these observations , the presence of a hard component in the batse energy range indicates that cyg x-1 was probably in the low state during most of the batse observations ; during the low - flux episode between tjd 9250 and 9430 a temporary transition to the high state may have occurred .    in figure 1",
    "we show a plot of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 . in the following discussion",
    "we will distinguish the data from the low - flux episode ( indicated by squares in fig .",
    "1 ) from the remainder of the data ( indicated by asterisks ) .",
    "we have included only days when @xmath8 was higher than 0.04 @xmath9 ; below this flux , @xmath7 is dominated by detector noise due to unresolved sources in the uncollimated lad field of view ( crary et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the measured value of @xmath7 becomes uncertain .",
    "typical errors are shown , calculated from the variance per bin of the daily averaged power spectra propagated through the calculation of @xmath7 , and from the results of the occultation analysis averaged over an entire day .    from figure 1",
    "it appears that during the low - flux episode ( tjd 92509430 ) , cyg  x-1 showed relatively little variability , with @xmath7 generally below 12% .",
    "these low - flux data by themselves do not show a correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; similarly , the remaining points in figure 1 , with @xmath7 usually in the range 1030% , do not show such correlation either .",
    "however , all points together follow a broad , upturning band in figure 1 , which indicates that there is a relation between the hard x - ray flux of cyg  x-1 and its variability .",
    "if during the low - flux episode cyg  x-1 was in the high state , this result would suggest a dependence of the hard x - ray variability on source state . although previous observations of other black - hole candidates have indicated that the flux in the hard tail of the energy spectrum decreases as the source enters a high state ( this , however , is very uncertain , see gilfanov et al .",
    "@xcite , and tanaka & lewin @xcite ) , the hard x - ray flux alone may not be a good marker of source state .",
    "however , the lack of low energy ( 110 kev ) observations prevents us from drawing a firm conclusion on this .",
    "note that the low value of @xmath7 is not the result of dilution of the variability of a hard spectral component by a less variable soft component .    in figure 2",
    "we have plotted @xmath7 versus the exponent , @xmath12 , of a power law fit to the 45140 kev spectrum ( paciesas et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; this figure shows that these two quantities are strongly correlated .",
    "the data obtained during the low - flux episode are offset systematically from the other data , showing both a softer spectrum ( by about 0.4 in @xmath12 ) and smaller variability .",
    "however , the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath12 does not reflect this systematic offset : the same correlation is followed by each of the two groups of points separately .",
    "the offset of the data from the low - flux episode from the other data , shown in both figures 1 and 2 leads one to suspect that the hard x - ray flux and spectral slope of cyg  x-1 are also correlated .",
    "figure 3 , which shows a plot of @xmath12 versus @xmath8 , confirms this suspicion . again , the two groups of data points are clearly separated in this diagram .",
    "however , for each of the two groups of points separately the correlation is not apparent ( for the high - flux points a correlation in the opposite sense may actually be present ) .",
    "we have found a strong correlation between the slope of the high - energy ( 20 - 100 kev ) x - ray spectrum of cyg x-1 and both its high - energy x - ray flux and the variability thereof . during most of our observations",
    "cyg x-1 showed strong variability with an amplitude that varied in anti - correlation with a cut - off frequency ( crary et al .",
    "@xcite ) similar to the low - state behavior in the lower - energy range described by belloni and hasinger ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that we encountered cyg x-1 mainly in the low state . during a 150 day interval beginning in 1993 september both the high - energy x - ray flux and",
    "its variability were extremely low ; it is possible that cyg x-1 had then entered a high state ; this remains uncertain , due to lack of low - energy coverage .",
    "the global correlations we have found between flux , variability and spectral hardness suggest to us that all three are determined by a basic system parameter ; the mass accretion rate is the obvious candidate .",
    "a variety of models have been calculated for the structure of the accretion disks around black holes , to explain the two - component character of their x - ray spectra , and the suspected relation of these spectral components with accretion rate ( liang & nolan @xcite , and references therein ; see also haardt et al .",
    "@xcite ; chakrabarti & titarchuk @xcite ) .    most of these models invoke a very hot medium , e.g. , a corona around the inner disk regions , that produces the hard power law component through upscattering of low - energy photons , and a standard shakura - sunyaev disk that provides the latter .",
    "most of these models do not address source variability .",
    "the fast variability of cyg x-1 and other black holes has often been described in terms of shot noise models ; the break frequency in the pds reflects the decay time of the shots ( sutherland , weisskopf , & kahn  @xcite ; miyamoto & kitamoto @xcite ; belloni & hasinger @xcite ) .",
    "however , the x - ray spectral properties are usually not considered in these models .",
    "mineshige et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , proposed that accretion disks around black holes are in a self - organized critical state .",
    "their qualitative arguments , aimed at an understanding of the low and high states , indicate that relatively hard x - ray spectra go with strong variability , and relatively soft x - ray spectra with weak variability .",
    "chakrabarti & titarchuk ( @xcite ) recently argued that accretion disks around black holes contain a shock , at several tens of schwarzschild radii . in the low state",
    ", the post - shock region is quite hot , and the emergent spectrum is very hard ( @xmath13 ) . in this model , @xmath12 increases with disk accretion rate in the low state .",
    "also in this context , molteni , sponholz , & chakrabarti  ( @xcite ) found that over a range in mass accretion rates the cooling time of the flow inside the shock is comparable to the infall time scale . under these conditions the location of the shock , and the x - ray luminosity , undergoes quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "the centroid frequency of these oscillations increases with the mass accretion rate , with typical values around 5 hz for a @xmath14 black hole .",
    "this result may be related to the anti - correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath7 for cyg x-1 , by using the recent results of van der hooft et al .",
    "( @xcite ) on the pds of the black - hole transient gro j1719@xmath224 .",
    "they found that the detailed shape of the pds remained invariant under a frequency shift marked by the variation of a strong qpo peak ( between @xmath15 and @xmath16 mhz ) , while also the power in a given ( stretched and squeezed ) rest frequency interval remained constant .",
    "this would suggest that the qpo frequency is proportional to a break frequency in the pds of this source , and that the latter may be used as a frequency scaler as well .",
    "if we are allowed to generalize this result for gro j1719@xmath224 to cyg x-1 , at least the direction of the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath7 found by us for cyg x-1 would be accounted for by the model described by chakrabarti & titarchuk ( @xcite ) and molteni et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "at super - eddington disk accretion rates the model of chakrabarti & titarchuk ( @xcite ) predicts that the flow inside the shock is cooled by comptonization of low energy photons from the disk , and the post - shock flow becomes predominantly radial ( and converging ) .",
    "comptonization in this region can still occur due to bulk motions , producing a hard tail with @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath12 increases weakly with the accretion rate ; note however that in this model the x - ray luminosity may not be a good measure of the accretion rate as part of the internal energy in the disk is advected into the black hole ( see also narayan , mcclintock , & yi  @xcite ) . in this regime",
    "the flux variability is determined by the variability of the illumination geometry of the converging inflow , and not by the change in the size of the post - shock region , as it is in the low state .",
    "the amplitude variation of the hard flux is expected to be smaller in this case ( corresponding to the high state , since the increase in disk accretion rate leads to a increase in soft emission ) than in the low state .",
    "it appears , then , that these theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with the data from the low - flux episode that we have observed in cyg x-1 .",
    "the correlations we have found for cyg  x-1 would easily have escaped attention were it not for the 1100 days of continuous coverage provided by the batse all - sky monitoring capabilities .",
    "we are looking forward to an improved understanding of our results in terms of the source state framework for black holes ( van der klis @xcite ) by combining the batse hard x - ray monitoring with that provided in the near future at low energies by xte .",
