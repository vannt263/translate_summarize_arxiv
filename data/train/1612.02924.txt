    "double beta decay ( dbd ) , namely the non exotic two - neutrino double - beta decay ( @xmath1-decay ) @xmath2 was first considered in publication @xcite of maria goeppert - mayer in 1935 , following the suggestion of eugene wigner about one year after the fermi weak interaction theory appeared . in this work",
    "an expression for the @xmath1-decay rate was derived and a half - life of @xmath3 years was estimated , assuming a q - value of about 10 mev .",
    "two years later ( 1937 ) ettore majorana formulated a new theory of neutrinos , whereby the neutrino @xmath4 and the antineutrino @xmath5 are indistinguishable , and suggested antineutrino induced @xmath6-decay for experimental verification of this hypothesis @xcite . in 1939 , wolfgang furry considered for the first time neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath7-decay ) , @xmath8 the available energy @xmath9 is equal to the @xmath10-value of the reaction , i.e. the mass difference of the ground states of the two atoms involved . + in 1952 henry primakoff @xcite calculated the electron - electron angular correlations and electron energy spectra for both the @xmath1-decay and the @xmath7-decay , producing a useful tool for distinguishing between the two processes . at that time",
    ", however , nothing was known about the chirality suppression of the @xmath7-decay .",
    "it was believed that , due to a considerable phase - space advantage , the @xmath7-decay mode dominates the double beta decay rate . starting in 1950",
    "this phenomenon was exploited in early geochemical , radiochemical and counter experiments .",
    "it was found that the measured lower limit on the @xmath11-decay half - life far exceeds the values expected for this process , @xmath12 years . in 1955",
    "the raymond davis experiment @xcite searching for the antineutrinos from reactor via nuclear reaction @xmath13 , produced a zero result .",
    "the above experiments were interpreted as proof that the neutrino was not a majorana particle , but a dirac particle .",
    "this prompted the introduction of the lepton number to distinguish the neutrino from its antiparticle .",
    "the assumption of lepton number conservation allows the @xmath1-decay but forbids the @xmath7-decay , in which lepton number is changed by two units .    the first geochemical observation of the @xmath11-decay , with an estimated half - life @xmath14 years , was announced by ingram and reynolds in 1950 @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been made by gentner and kirsten @xcite and others @xcite,@xcite on such rare - gass isotopes as @xmath15kr , @xmath16xe , and @xmath17xe , which are @xmath11-decay products of @xmath15se @xmath16te , and @xmath17te , respectively , obtaining half lives around 10@xmath18y for @xmath17te .    within the standard model ( sm ) it became apparent that the assumption of lepton number conservation led to the neutrino being strictly massless .",
    "with the development of grand unified theories ( gut s ) of the electroweak and strong interactions , it was realized that lepton number conservation was the result of a global symmetry not of a gauge symmetry and had to be broken at some level . in such models",
    "one could distinguish between the neutrinos produced in weak interactions ( flavor neutrinos ) and the eigenstates of the world hamiltonian .",
    "the latter eigenstates can naturally be majorana neutrinos , while dirac type eigenstates could arise as a special case .",
    "the flavor neutrinos could still be of dirac type , if the majorana phases of the eigenstates are all the same , in agreement with davis experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , through the pioneering work of kotani and his group @xcite , the interest in @xmath7-decay experiments was revived and brought it again to the attention of the nuclear physics community .",
    "the @xmath7-decay , which involves the emission of two electrons and no neutrinos , has been found to be more than a tool in studying lepton number violating processes . schechter and valle proved that , if the @xmath7-decay takes place , regardless of the mechanism causing it , the neutrinos are majorana particles with non - zero mass @xcite .",
    "it was also recognized that the gut s and r - parity violating susy models offer a plethora of the @xmath7-decay mechanisms triggered by exchange of neutrinos , neutralinos , gluinos , leptoquarks , etc . @xcite .",
    "the experimental effort concentrated on high @xmath19 isotopes , in particular on @xmath20ca , @xmath21ge , @xmath15se , @xmath22zr , @xmath23mo , @xmath24cd , @xmath17te , @xmath25xe and @xmath26nd @xcite . in 1987 the first actual laboratory observation of the two neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath1-decay ) was done for @xmath15se by m. moe and collaborators @xcite , who used a time projection chamber . within the next few years , experiments employing counters were able to detect @xmath1-decay of many nuclei .",
    "in addition , the experiments searching for the signal of the @xmath7-decay pushed by many orders of magnitude the experimental lower limits for the @xmath7-decay half - life of different nuclei .    a great leap forward was achieved , when , early measurements of neutrinos produced in the sun , in the atmosphere , and by accelerators , suggested that neutrinos may oscillate from one `` flavor '' ( electron , muon , and tau ) to another , expected if the neutrinos are massive and non degenerate in mass .",
    "non - zero neutrino mass can be accommodated by fairly straightforward extensions of the sm of particle physics .",
    "thus now , starting in 1998 , we have convincing evidence about the existence of non zero neutrino masses in superkamiokande @xcite , sno , @xcite kamland @xcite and other experiments .",
    "such experiments , however , can not determine the absolute scale of neutrino mass . so the determination of the scale of neutrino mass has been directed to other methods , such as cosmological observations , @xmath27-decay experiments and , especially if the scale happens to be in the mev range , to @xmath7-decay , see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite .",
    "so far the @xmath1-decay has been recorded for eleven nuclei ( @xmath20ca , @xmath21ge , @xmath15se , @xmath22zr , @xmath23mo , @xmath24cd , @xmath16te , @xmath17te , @xmath26nd , @xmath25xe , @xmath28u ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1-decay to the first @xmath29 excited state of the daughter nucleus has been observed in the case of the targets @xmath23mo and @xmath26nd .",
    "furthermore the two - neutrino double electron capture process in @xmath30 has been recorded .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay has not yet been confirmed .",
    "the strongest limit recently obtained is @xmath31y by gando _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( see section [ sect : exp ] for details ) .",
    "if the neutrinos are majorana particles other related processes in which the charge of the nucleus is decreased by two units may also occur , if they happen to be allowed by energy and angular momentum conservation laws , e.g. double positron emission , electron positron conversion , resonant neutrinoless double electron capture ( @xmath32ecec ) @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting topic with a lot of theoretical work@xcite and it appears promising in view of progress in accurately determining the @xmath10-values @xcite needed to establish the condition of resonance employing penning traps @xcite .",
    "recently , the accuracy of @xmath10-values at around 100 ev was achieved @xcite , which has already allowed to exclude some of isotopes from the list of the most promising candidates ( e.g. , @xmath33sn and @xmath34er ) for searching the @xmath32ecec . in spite of the fact that an increased experimental activity in the field of the resonant @xmath32ecec @xcite in the case of @xmath35cd @xcite and @xmath33sn @xcite .",
    "resonant @xmath32ecec has some important advantages with respect to experimental signatures and background conditions , but we do not know of any experiment under way in this direction and we are not going to review this field further . anyway @xmath7-decay ( eq . ( [ eq : a ] ) ) , seventy five years after it was first conceived , seems to be the most likely to yield the information @xcite we seek .",
    "from a nuclear physics @xcite point of view , calculating the relevant nuclear matrix elements is indeed a challenge .",
    "first almost all nuclei , which can undergo double beta decay , are far from closed shells and some of them are even deformed .",
    "one thus faces a formidable task .",
    "second the nuclear matrix elements are small compared to a canonical value , like the one associated with the matrix element to the ( energy non allowed ) double gamow - teller resonance or a small fraction of some appropriate sum rule .",
    "thus , effects which are normally negligible , become important here .",
    "third , in many models the dominant mechanism for @xmath7-decay may not involve intermediate light neutrinos , but very heavy particles . thus one must be able to cope with the short distance behavior of the relevant operators ( see section [ secnme ] for details ) .",
    "it is also important from a particle physics point of view .",
    "the recent discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite have given the first evidence of the fact that the neutrinos are massive , which necessitates to go beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics more specifically these experiments showed that the neutrinos are admixed and determined all three mixing angles ( for a global analysis see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore they determined one square mass difference @xmath36 and the absolute value of the other . i.e. @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "future neutrino oscillations in matter are expected to fix the unknown sign .",
    "neutrino oscillations , however , can not determine :    * whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles . + it is obviously important to proceed further and decide on this important issue .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay can achieve this , even though , as we have mentioned , there might be other lepton violating processes contributing to @xmath7-decay .",
    "it is known that whatever lepton number violating process gives rise to @xmath7-decay , it can be used to generate a majorana mass for the neutrino @xcite . *",
    "the scale of the neutrino masses .",
    "+ this task can be accomplished by astrophysical observations or via other experiments involving low energy weak decays , like triton decay or electron capture , or the @xmath7-decay .",
    "it seems that for a neutrino mass scale in mev , ( @xmath39 ev ) , region , the best process to achieve this is the @xmath7-decay .",
    "the extraction of neutrino masses from such observations will be discussed in detail and compared with each other later ( see section [ sec : extrnumass ] ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , however , is not the only one , which can induce @xmath7-decay .",
    "if , however , @xmath7 is ever found to occur , it will be possible to disentangle the most important neutrino mass contribution , involving the neutrino mass scale , from the other mechanisms , provided that data on a number of targets become available .",
    "the neutrino hierarchy , i.e. whether the neutrinos are almost degenerate , the normal hierarchy ( @xmath40 or the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath41 , can also be inferred from double beta decay . for details on such issues",
    "see recent reviews @xcite . as we have mentioned to extract useful information from the @xmath42 decay one must know the nuclear matrix elements employing baysian statistics @xcite based on a markov chain monte carlo @xcite , since one can not avoid the issue related to other possible mechanisms contributing to the process . ] .",
    "efforts to this end can be summarized as follows : + 1 .",
    "shell model calculations .",
    "these have a long history @xcite in double beta decay calculations . in recent years",
    "it has lead to large matrix calculations in traditional as well as monte carlo types of formulations @xcite . for a more complete set of references as well as a discussion of the appropriate effective interactions",
    "qrpa calculations .",
    "there have been a number of such calculations covering almost all nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "these involve a number of collaborations , but the most extensive and complete calculations in one way or another include the tuebingen group .",
    "we also have seen some refinements of qrpa , like proton neutron pairing , inclusion of renormalization effects due to pauli principle corrections @xcite and isospin restoration@xcite .",
    "other less conventional approaches , like operator expansion techniques have also been employed @xcite .",
    "+ 3 . other nuclear models .",
    "recently , calculations based on the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) method @xcite , the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and the energy density functional ( edf ) method @xcite and relativistic edf ( redf ) @xcite entered the field of such calculations . +",
    "the above schemes , in conjunction with the other improvements mentioned above , offer some optimism in our efforts for obtaining nuclear matrix elements accurate enough to allow us to extract reliable values of the lepton violating parameters from the data .",
    "+ the experimental results will be examined and discussed in section [ sect : exp ] .",
    "within the sm of elementary particles , with the particle content of the gauge bosons @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the higgs scalar isodoublet @xmath45 ( and its conjugate @xmath46 ) and the fermion fields arranged in :    * isodoublets : @xmath47 and @xmath48 for quarks and leptons respectively and * isosinglets : @xmath49 and @xmath50    where @xmath51 is a family index taking three values . in the context of the standard model ( sm ) the neutrinos are massless .",
    "they can not obtain mass after the symmetry breaking , like the quarks and the charged leptons do , since the right handed neutrino is absent .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm that would yield mass for the neutrino is to introduce an isosinglet right handed neutrino .",
    "then one can have a dirac mass term arising via coupling of the leptons and higgs @xcite .",
    "the existence of dirac neutrinos is fine within the above minimal extension , but this is not interesting from our point of view , since the particle can not be the same with its antiparticle and , thus , it can not lead to neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "furthermore in grand unified theories one is faced with the problem that these neutrinos are going to be very heavy with a mass similar to that of up quarks , which is clearly unacceptable .",
    "so such a model is inadequate .",
    "the next extension of the sm is to introduce a majorana type mass involving the isosinglet neutrinos and an additional isosinglet higgs field , which can acquire a large vacuum expectation value , an idea essentially put forward by weinberg @xcite long time ago .",
    "thus the neutrino mass matrix becomes @xcite : = ( |_l,|_l^c ) (    cc0&m^d + ( m^d)^t & m_r    ) (    c_r + _",
    "r^c    ) [ eq : see - saw ] thus , provided that the majorana mass matrix has only very large eigenvalues , one obtains an effective majorana @xmath52 matrix : _",
    "= -|_l(m^d)^t m_r^-1m_d^c_r , [ eq : majmat ] which can provide small neutrino masses provided that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath53 are sufficiently large .",
    "@xmath53 can be arbitrarily large and is identified the total lepton number violating ( lnv ) scale indicated by @xmath54 .",
    "this new scale , commonly associated with the vacuum expectation of the isosinglet , does not affect the low energy scale arising from the vacuum expectation value of the standard higgs particles .",
    "+ this is the celebrated see - saw mechanism . more precisely there exist three see - saw types ( see , e.g. , abada _ et al _",
    "@xcite for a summary and more recently @xcite ) . furthermore in some of these versions @xcite new contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay are claimed .",
    "a more systematic decomposition of the neutrinoless double beta decay operator has also recently appeared @xcite .",
    "it is possible for the heavy majorana neutrinos not to be equally heavy . by appropriately arranging the corresponding dirac coupling",
    ", it is possible to get one majorana neutrino in the kev scale , which couples very weakly to the three light neutrinos .",
    "this is the so called sterile neutrino .",
    "+ anyway with the see - saw mechanism the neutrino flavors get admixed , the resulting eigenstates are majorana particles and lepton number violating interactions , like @xmath55 decay , become possible .",
    "other extensions of the sm , which do not require the presence of right - handed neutrinos , are possible in which a light @xmath52 majorana mas matrix @xmath56 can be generated via an isotriplet scalar acquiring a vacuum expectation value or via its couplings to two isodoublet scalar fields at tree or at the one loop level .",
    "it is also possible to achieve this via generic diagrams involving weinberg s idea @xcite . by introducing exotic isosinglet or isotriplet fermions or in the context of r - parity violating supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we will not consider these possibilities , since they have been examined elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we should mention , however , that there exist models which generate majorana masses at the 2-loop level , first proposed long time ago @xcite as an economic way of getting neutrino majorana mass .",
    "in one such approach @xcite , reinventing the extended majorana matrix @xcite , now coined inverse see - saw , it is claimed that , using the available neutrino oscillation data , the full majorana matrix can be determined leading to a prediction of the majorana phases .      we have seen above that in general the neutrino mass matrix , eq . ( [ eq : see - saw ] ) , is a complex symmetric matrix .",
    "it can , however , be diagonalized by separate left and write unitary transformations @xcite @xcite : s_l(^0_l,^0c_l)&= & (    lr s^(11 ) & s^(12 ) + s^(21 ) & s^(11 )    ) (    c _l + n_l    ) , + s_r(^0c_r,^0_r ) & = & (    lr ( s^(11 ) ) ^ * & ( s^(12 ) ) ^ * + ( s^(21 ) ) ^ * & ( s^(22 ) ) ^ *    ) (    c _r + n_r    ) [ eq : mixing ] where we have added the superscript 0 to stress that they are the states entering the weak interactions .",

    "the full parametrization of matrix @xmath70 includes 15 rotational angles and 10 dirac and 5 majorana cp violating phases .",
    "the neutrinos interact with the charged leptons via the charged current ( see below ) .",
    "so the effective coupling of the neutrinos to the charged leptons involves the mixing of the electrons @xmath71 .",
    "thus the standard mixing matrix appearing in the absence of right - handed neutrinos is : u_pmns = u = u^(11)=(s^(e ) )",

    "note also that the neutrinos appearing in weak interactions can be majorana particles in the special case that all majorana phases are the same .",
    "unfortunately the above notation is not unique . for the reader",
    "s convenience we mention that sometimes the notation u^(11)u , u^(12)s , u^(21)t , u^(22)v [ maticazmies ] is employed @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to decompose the @xmath72 mixing matrix as follows @xcite & = & (    ll & + & u_0 +    ) (    ll a & r + s & b +    ) (    ll v_0 & + & +    ) , [ maticaxing ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the @xmath52 zero and identity matrices , respectively . the parametrization of matrices a , b , r and s and corresponding orthogonality relations are given in @xcite . in the limit case a = @xmath74 , b = @xmath74 , r = @xmath73 and s = @xmath73 there would be a separate mixing of heavy and light neutrinos , which would participate only in left and right - handed currents , respectively . in that case only the neutrino mass mechanism of the @xmath7-decay would be allowed and exchange neutrino momentum dependent mechanisms associated with the @xmath75-@xmath76 exchange and @xmath75-@xmath76 mixing would be forbidden . if masses of heavy neutrinos are above the tev scale , the mixing angles responsible for mixing of light and heavy neutrinos are small . by neglecting the mixing between different generations of light and heavy neutrinos a ,",
    "b , r and s matrices can be approximated as follows : @xmath77 here , @xmath78 represents energy scale of charged leptons and @xmath54 is the total lepton number violating scale , which corresponds to masses of heavy neutrinos . for sake of simplicity the same mixing angle",

    "it was found that a least - squares fit of @xmath299 and @xmath312 , where possible , to the @xmath27-decay rate and @xmath313/ec rate of the @xmath314 = @xmath315 ground state in the intermediate nuclei involved in double - beta decay in addition to the @xmath1 rates of the initial nuclei , leads to an effective @xmath299 of about 0.7 or 0.8 .",
    "this value , which is comparable to that needed in the shell model to reproduce @xmath1-decay rates is significantly smaller than 1.0 - 1.27 , the range usually used in the qrpa @xcite .",
    "the above statistical approach has been extended also for analysis of 47 isobaric triplets 28 more extended isobaric chains of nuclei to extract values and uncertainties for @xmath299 in calculations performed within the qrpa .",
    "a comparatively small value of @xmath299 was found @xcite .",
    "we see that the uncertainty in the calculated @xmath7-decay half - life due to quenching is quite large .",
    "the quenching of axial - vector coupling constant is assumed to have different sources like the truncation of the many - nucleon hilbert space and the many - body currents , which reduce matrix elements by amounts that are still in dispute .",

    "the constants @xmath323 , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 are the effective field theory parameters , fit to data in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-decay matrix element has a different form than does the @xmath1 matrix element and it might be that the quenching @xmath1 decay has a smaller effect on @xmath7-decay .",
    "first , this issue was discussed in the context of the two - body currents and the ism in ref .",
    "it was found that the effect of the two - body currents decreases as the momentum transfer increases , and so such currents will quench @xmath1-decay nme , for which the momentum transfer is essentially zero , more than the @xmath7-decay nme , since in the latter case the intermediate neutrino can transfer several hundred mev of momentum from one decaying nucleon to the other .",
    "later this finding was also confirmed within the qrpa@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that , if most of the quenching is due to two - body currents , as effective field theory suggests , the @xmath7-matrix elements may be quenched by a factor on the order of 30% @xcite .",
    "+ the nuclear matrix element @xmath326 calculated for the nuclei of experimental interest , obtained by consideration both one- and two - body currents within the qrpa@xcite , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] .    currently , it is difficult to assign both systematic and statistical uncertainties to calculated nmes@xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated way to do it has been proposed in the framework of the qrpa@xcite and applied later within the phfb@xcite .",
    "further , within the qrpa for a given set of nuclei , it has been shown that the correlations among nme errors are as important as their size @xcite .",
    "it is desired that also other groups present `` statistical samples '' of nme calculations as well , in order to provide independent estimates of ( co)variances for their nme estimates . a covariance analysis proposed",
    "@xcite is the way to estimate correctly current or prospective sensitivities to effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath120 .",
    "the investigation of the quenching of the axial current in double beta decay will be illuminated by the relevant experimental searches ( see section [ sect : expme ] ) .",
    "accurate determination of the nmes , and a realistic estimate of their uncertainty , remains of great importance .",
    "methods are developed and improved .",
    "increasing computer power should allow them to include all important nuclear physics aspects and to reproduce relevant nuclear physics observables .",
    "the ultimate goal is to evaluate nuclear matrix elements with uncertainty of less than 30% to establish the unknown neutrino mass scale . to this end , it is crucial that the theory groups consider all factors outlined above in order to evaluate nmes within 15 @xmath245 uncertainty and the experimental groups provide relevant data to be used in checking these models .",
    "in this review we analyzed the @xmath42-decay process , which is the oldest and perhaps the best to test lepton number violation and at the same time settle the issue of the nature of the neutrino , i.e. whether the neutrino mass eigenstates are of the majorana or dirac type .",
    "we also have seen that it is the best process to settle the neutrino mass scale in the few mev scale . to achieve these goals first , and most important",
    ", some serious experimental problems must be overcome in order to be able measure life times of the order of @xmath327y .",
    "we have discussed the ongoing , planned and future experiments .",
    "we have witnessed a great progress in tackling the various background problems , improving the energy resolution and preparing large masses of the needed isotopes .",
    "+ to encourage and guide the experiments we considered a variety of particle models , which allow the double beta decay to occur at a reasonable level .",
    "the most important mechanism involves the light majorana neutrino , but we considered other competing mechanisms as well . + in order to extract useful information from the data i ) the phase space integrals must be reliably calculated .",
    "there has been great progress in this direction , but we are haunted by the quenching of the axial current .",
    "this is crucial in determining the expected life time .",
    "there appears to be hope towards determining its effective value by using other related experimental information .",
    "ii ) the precise evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements themselves .",
    "it is encouraging that all available nuclear models ( the interacting shell model , the quasiparticle random phase approximation , the interacting boson model , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov method and the energy density factional method ) are being used in the evaluation of all the needed @xmath7-decay nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the fact that these vastly different models agree in the predicted values of these me for various mechanisms and a number of different targets as well as the fact that they reproduce data on other related experiments , such as single beta decay rates and charge exchange reactions , gives us confidence that they are perhaps estimated better than a factor of 2 .",
    "admittedly we have not witnessed any great progress during the last few years and this situation must be improved .",
    "it is hoped that some constraints may arise by utilizing experimental input from other processes .",
    "+ it is clear that the mere observation of double beta decay will be a triumph of physics .",
    "the next day , however , the extraction of the most useful parameter , namely the determination of the scale of the neutrino mass , will begin .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite , given adequate information on a number of judiciously chosen targets , the neutrino mass can , in principle , be extracted from the data even in the case that other competing mechanisms may significantly contribute to this process .",
