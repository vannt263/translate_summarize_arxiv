    "the solar neutrino problem [ 2 ] is now established essentially independent of any details of the standard solar models ( ssm ) .",
    "the so called model - independent analysis was performed by several authors [ 3,10,4,19,16,24,5,17,13 ] which revealed that the @xmath0be neutrinos must be strongly depleted compared to the ssm prediction . from these analyses",
    "one can conclude that the solar neutrino problem can not be explained by astrophysical mechanisms unless some assumptions in the standard electroweak theory and/or solar neutrino experiments are grossly incorrect . in this work ,",
    "we repeat the model - independent analysis using the latest solar neutrino data as well as the new updated theoretical prediction by bahcall and pinsonneault ( bp98 ) [ 7 ] .",
    "our analysis will indicate that astrophysical solution such as the low-@xmath1 model [ 2 ] is convincingly excluded by the present data .",
    "we also present a new way of illuminating the suppression pattern of various solar neutrino flux originated from different fusion reactions in a less model - dependent fashion .",
    "we will observe that the statement of the missing @xmath0be neutrinos is no more true in the presense of neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "[ tab : data ]    .observed solar neutrino event rates used in this analysis and corresponding theoretical predictions [ 7 ] .",
    "the quoted errors are at @xmath2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : chi2 ]    -5 cm    -6",
    "cm      we next consider the case where the neutrinos are converted into sterile species . since",
    "only the water - cherenkov experiment can be sensitive to the difference between conversions into active and sterile neutrinos any change in our result from the active case solely comes from @xmath3b neutrinos .",
    "the results for the sterile neutrino conversion is presented in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) and in table 2 . by comparing fig . 2(a ) and ( b ) , we can clearly see that the stronger suppression of @xmath0be neutrinos is required than the case of active conversion in the case with @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the best fit is obtained when the flux of intermediate energy neutrino is negative .",
    "finally , we discuss the sensitivity of our results against the change in the neutrino flux from those of the ssm .",
    "since the @xmath5 neutrino flux is essentially fixed by the solar luminosity and also the @xmath0be neutrino flux are better determined compared to the @xmath3b flux which is subject to the uncertainty of the nuclear cross section @xmath6 , we only vary the @xmath3b flux and examine the sensitivity of the required reduction rates against its change .",
    "we will perform this exercise only for the active neutrino conversion case since for the sterile case the result presented in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) still holds if @xmath7 is regarded as @xmath8 if we vary @xmath9 , whereas for the active case , this is not true , because in the water - cherenkov experiment , the event rate depends not only on @xmath10 but also on @xmath9 itself .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the allowed range of the reduction rates of the neutrino flux by ( artificially ) varying the @xmath3b neutrino flux prediction of the ssm .",
    "the result of the exercise indicates that as the @xmath9 gets larger , preferred value of @xmath11 becomes larger , while @xmath12 gets smaller as seen in the plot .",
    "this feature is consistent with one obtained by smirnov in table i of [ 25 ] .",
    "let us note that the arbitrariness of the interpretation of which @xmath9 or @xmath13 are changed from the standard theory can be removed if we combine the results of the superkamiokande and either one of charged or ( preferable ) neutral current data from the sno experiment [ 12 ] .",
    "one can separately estimate the flux of @xmath3b neutrinos and the survival probability by combining these two experiments .",
    "we have performed the updated model - independent analysis of the current solar neutrino data .",
    "we confirmed , with current data of any two sets out of the three , the @xmath14cl , the @xmath15ga and the superkamiokande experiments that : ( 1 ) the ssm prediction can be convincingly rejected , and ( 2 ) the @xmath0be neutrinos is strongly suppressed unless @xmath3b neutrinos are converted into another active flavor .",
    "we have shown that the low-@xmath1 model is excluded by more than 5 @xmath16 ( 3 @xmath16 ) with data of the three ( two out of the three ) experiments .",
    "the best fitted value of @xmath0be neutrino flux is always negative even if we do not impose the luminosity constraint .    on the other hand , if we assume that neutrino flavor conversion of @xmath17 or @xmath18 is occurring , the best fitted flux of @xmath0be ( or intermediate energy ) neutrino is no longer negative .",
    "the current solar neutrino data suggest , as the best fit in our analysis , that ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20(0.4 , 0.2 , 0.8 ) .",
    "while it is still suppressed the value of the intermediate energy neutrinos makes most notable difference between cases with and without neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "we hope that this point is resolved by the future solar neutrino experiments .",
    "more detailed discussions and relevant references are found in ref .  [ 21 ] .",
