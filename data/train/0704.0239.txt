    "hydrophobic hydration in equilibrium is a phenomenon which exhibits qualitatively different behavior at small and large length scales . @xcite",
    "while small solutes ( radii @xmath31 nm ) are accommodated by water with only minor perturbations , larger solutes ( @xmath41 nm ) induce major rearrangements of water interfacial structure . as a consequence the solvation free energy @xmath5 of small hydrophobic cavities scales with solute volume while for",
    "larger cavities it grows with surface area ( as a good approximation near liquid - vapor coexistence ) accompanied by weak solvent dewetting at extended restraining hydrophobic surfaces.@xcite furthermore , water , which is close to the liquid - vapor transition at normal conditions , can minimize interface area by locally evaporating and forming a nanobubble within hydrophobic confinement .",
    "evidence of bubble formation in confined geometry has been given early by computer simulations of smooth plate - like solutes,@xcite but more recently it has been demonstrated in varying degrees in atomistically resolved plate - like solutes , @xcite hydrophobic tubes and ion channels,@xcite and in the collapse of proteins,@xcite suggesting that it plays a key role in the stabilization and folding dynamics of certain classes of biomolecules.@xcite experimental evidence of nanobubbles in strong confinement ( in contrast to bubbles at a single planar surface  @xcite ) has been given for instance in studies of water between hydrophobic surfaces,@xcite in zeolites and silica nanotubes,@xcite and on a subnanometer scale in nonpolar protein cavities.@xcite    the dewetting induced change in solvation energy is typically estimated using simple macroscopic arguments as known from capillarity theory , e.g. by describing interfaces with laplace - young ( ly ) type of equations.@xcite recently an extension of the ly equation has become available which extrapolates to microscopic scales by including a curvature correction to the interface tension and considering atomistic dispersion and electrostatic potentials of the solvated solute explicitly.@xcite although those macroscopic considerations ( e.g , . the concept of surface tension ) are supposed to break down on atomistic scales they show surprisingly good results for the solvation energy of microscopic solutes , e.g.  alkanes and noble gases , and quantitatively account for dewetting effects in nanometer - sized hydrophobic confinement.@xcite while we conclude that the equilibrium location of the solute - solvent interface seems to be well described by those techniques , nothing is known about the interface _ dynamics _ of evolution and relaxation . in this study",
    "we address two fundamental questions : first , what are the equations which govern the interface motion on atomistic ( @xmath21 nm ) scales ?",
    "secondly , does the dynamics exhibit any signatures of the length scale crossover found in equilibrium ?",
    "on macroscopic scales the collapse dynamics of a ( vapor or gas ) bubble is related to the well - known phenomenon of sonoluminescence.@xcite the governing equations can be derived from navier - stokes and capillarity theory and are expressed by the rayleigh - plesset ( rp ) equation.@xcite we will show that the rp equation simplifies in the limit of microscopic cavities and can be extended to give a quantitative description of cavity interface dynamics on nanometer length scales .",
    "we find a qualitatively different dynamics than the typical `` mean - curvature flow '' description of moving interfaces , @xcite in particular a typical magnitude of interface or collapse velocity given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid viscosity , @xmath6 .",
    "our study is restricted to the generic case of the collapse of a spherical cavity and is complemented by explicit solvent molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations .",
    "we note here that recently , lugli and zerbetto studied nanobubble collapse in ionic solutions by md simulations on similar length scales.@xcite while their md data compares favorably with our results their interpretation and conclusions in terms of the rp equation are different .",
    "we will resume this discussion in the conclusion section .    in this study",
    "we show that a simple analytical approach quantitatively describes microscopic cavity collapse for a variety of different solvent situations while the simulations suggest that the solvent viscosity needs to be corrected for curvature effects . our study might offer a simple starting point for an efficient implicit modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in nonequilibrium .",
    "the rayleigh - plesset equation for the time evolution of a macroscopic vapor bubble with radius @xmath0 can be written as@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the solvent mass density , @xmath9 the difference in liquid and vapor pressures , @xmath10 the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath11 the liquid - vapor interface tension .",
    "while for macroscopic bubble radii the inertial terms ( left hand side ) control the dynamics , for decreasing radii the frictional and pressure terms ( right hand side ) grow in relative magnitude and eventually dominate , so that completely overdamped dynamics can be assumed on atomistic scales : @xmath12 a rough estimate for the threshold radius @xmath13 below which friction dominates is given when the reynolds number @xmath14 becomes unity and viscous and inertial forces are balanced . with a typical initial interface velocity of the order of @xmath15 [ from @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ rp1 ] ) ] we obtain @xmath17 which is @xmath18 nm for water at normal conditions .",
    "note that this threshold value can deviate considerably for a fluid different than water and that the viscosity typically has a strong temperature ( @xmath19 ) dependence which implies that @xmath13 can change significantly with @xmath19 .    in equilibrium ( @xmath20 ) the remaining expression in eq .",
    "( [ rp2 ] ) is the ( spherical ) ly equation @xmath21 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ rp2 ] ) describes a linear relationship between capillary pressure and interface velocity where @xmath22 plays the role of an interface mobility ( inverse friction).@xcite interestingly , the mobility is linear in bubble radius which leads to a _ constant _ velocity driven by surface tension _ independent _ of radius ( assuming @xmath23 ) ; this has to be contrasted to the typically used capillary dynamics which is proportional to the local mean curvature @xmath24.@xcite    generalizations of the ly equation to small scales are available by adding a gaussian curvature term ( @xmath25 ) as shown by boruvka and neumann@xcite ; that has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a first order curvature correction in surface tension , i.e. @xmath26,@xcite where @xmath27 is the tolman length  @xcite and @xmath28 the liquid - vapor surface tension for a planar interface ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the tolman length has a magnitude which is usually of the order of the size of a solvent molecule .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed experimentally that the viscosity of strongly confined water can depend on the particular nature of the surface / interface.@xcite we conclude that in general one has to anticipate that - analogous to the surface tension - the effective interface viscosity obeys a curvature correction in the limit of small cavities due to water restructuring in the first solvent layers at the hydrophobic interface . in the following",

    "we note that the choice of the @xmath35-scaling of the viscosity curvature correction has no direct physical justification and is arbitrary .",
    "we think however , that a curvature correction based on an expansion in orders of mean curvature is the simplest and most natural way for such a choice .    in water at normal conditions the pressure terms in ( [ rp3 ] ) are negligible so that for large radii ( @xmath36 ) the interface velocity is constant and @xmath37 .",
    "this leads to a collapse velocity of about @xmath380.4 / ps ( 40 m/s ) which is 6@xmath39 of the thermal velocity of water @xmath40 showing that dissipative heating of the system is relatively weak on these scales . a rough estimate for the dissipation rate can be made by the released interfacial energy @xmath41 yielding for instance @xmath42ps for a bubble with @xmath432 nm . at small radii ( @xmath44 )",

    "while extending to small scales we have assumed that the time scale of internal interface dynamics , i.e. hydrogen bond rearrangements,@xcite is much faster than the one of bubble collapse .",

    "the theoretical prediction ( [ rp4 ] ) agrees very well without any fitting using the viscosity from system i. we find that the acceleration is mainly due to the electrostatic attraction ; the dispersion term plays just a minor role while the excluded volume repulsion eventually determines the final ( equilibrium ) radius of the interface with @xmath110 .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple analytical and quantitative description of the interface motion of a microscopic cavity by modifying the macroscopic rp equation . based on our md data we find for the macroscopic description that analogous to the surface tension the viscosity has to be corrected for curvature effects , a prediction compelling to investigate further in detail and probably related to the restructuring of interfacial water for high curvatures ( small @xmath105 ) .",
    "the viscosity correction accelerates collapse dynamics markedly below the equilibrium crossover scale ( @xmath21 nm ) in contrast to the pure equilibrium picture where surface tension decreases what slows down the collapse .",
    "further , we find that the dynamics is curvature - driven due to the _ corrections _ to surface tension and viscosity , not due surface tension as often postulated.@xcite as a simple estimate , the interface velocity is typically given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid viscosity , @xmath6 .",
    "a comment has to be made regarding the recent work of lugli and zerbetto on md simulations of nanobubble collapse in ionic solutions . while their md data of the collapse velocity for a 1 nm bubble agree very well with our results their interpretation in terms of the rp equation is different .",
    "they fit the violent regime solution of the rp equation to the data [ which is the solution of only the inertial part , left hand side of ( [ rp1 ] ) ] and argue that the violent regime still holds on the nm scale .",
    "as demonstrated in this work , we arrive to a different conclusion : the collapse is friction dominated , the collapse driving force is mainly capillary pressure , and we suggest that the microscopic viscosity has to be curvature corrected to explain the high curvature collapse behavior in the md simulations .",
    "the good agreement between our modified rp equation and the md data for different solvent conditions , leading for instance to an altered solvent surface tension or viscosity , support our view .",
    "we finally note that extensions of the ly equation are based on minimizing an appropriate free energy @xmath5 or free energy functional @xcite so that we can write in a more general form @xmath111/[\\eta(r)r]$ ] .",
    "it is highly desirable to generalize this simple dynamics further to arbitrary geometries with which a wide field of potential applications might open up , i.e. an efficient implicit modeling of the water interface dynamics in the nonequilibrium process of hydrophobic nanoassembly , protein docking and folding , and nanofluidics .",
