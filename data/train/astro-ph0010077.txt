    "understanding the nature of the ultimate power source in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) has been a primary driver for numerous scientific investigations ever since the discovery in the 1980 s that ulirgs represent the most luminous class of galaxies in the local universe . with total power outputs comparable to those of quasars , characterizing the source of power",
    "is of fundamental importance in understanding the composition and evolution of normal galaxies .",
    "ulirgs are found to share the common trait that virtually all have recently or are currently experiencing major encounters with other galaxies @xcite . encounters like these may play a significant role in the process of building normal galaxies . with the discovery of faint sources at sub - millimeter wavelengths having characteristic spectral energy distributions like that typically found in ulirgs ( e.g. , arp  220 ) and redshifts @xmath7 , the importance of understanding these systems and their role in the evolution of normal galaxies has been heightened .",
    "the present survey was designed to look for near - infrared spectral signatures of obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in ulirgs , either by the presence of velocity - broadened pa@xmath2 emission or by the appearance of the high excitation [ coronal line .",
    "a summary of the conclusions of this survey , along with a median ulirg near - infrared spectrum , are presented in @xcite .",
    "only two of the 33 sample galaxies show clear indications for agn activity , with the rest appearing to be dominated by star formation processes .",
    "either the agn phenomenon is relatively rare among ulirgs , or the extinction at 2 @xmath1 m is still too high to permit a proper assessment . mid infrared studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favor the former conclusion , though it is found in this study that the extinction at 2 @xmath1 m may often be greater than four magnitudes , resulting in over one magnitude of extinction at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this paper presents the individual nuclear spectra for the sample galaxies , for both the primary and secondary nuclei where possible .",
    "two - dimensional spectra are also presented to give a qualitative view of the line emission distributions typically found in ulirgs .",
    "some discussion of extinction measures , molecular hydrogen excitation mechanisms , and a summary of typical line ratios found in ulirgs is included , as is a discussion of the velocity differences found among double nucleus systems .",
    "the sample of 33 ulirgs in this survey originates from the 2jy sample of _ iras _ ( infrared astronomical satellite ) galaxies defined by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in the present sample are chosen to meet the following criteria :    1 .   60 @xmath1 m flux density , @xmath8(60 @xmath1 m ) @xmath9 1.94 jy 2 .",
    "moderate or high quality iras flux measurements at 60 and 100 @xmath1 m ( as defined in the * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 3 .   @xmath10(60 @xmath1m)@xmath11(12 @xmath1m)@xmath12(25 @xmath1 m ) , where @xmath8(@xmath13 ) is the _ iras _ flux density 4 .",
    "far - infrared luminosity @xmath14 5 .   absolute galactic latitude , @xmath15 6 .",
    "declination , @xmath16 7 .",
    "redshift , @xmath17    the first six conditions are those used to define the northern 2 jy ulirg sample in @xcite , such that the current sample is a subset of this work .",
    "the seventh condition places both the pa@xmath2 and br@xmath3 lines in the @xmath18 band atmospheric window .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is computed from the iras flux densities by the following conversion:@xmath19 l_{\\odot } , \\ ] ] @xcite where @xmath20 represents the luminosity distance to the source in mpc .    due to the redshift constraint",
    ", the current sample approximately represents a complete volume - limited sample , because even the galaxies with the minimum 60 @xmath1 m flux density are luminous enough to meet the sample criteria at all allowed redshifts . at the outer redshift limit of the survey , corresponding to a luminosity distance of 455 mpc using @xmath21 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 and @xmath22 ( as is assumed throughout ) , the minimum 60 @xmath1 m flux density of 1.94 jy by itself accounts for @xmath23 of the total far - infrared luminosity . to make up the remaining @xmath24 necessary for sample inclusion , the 100 @xmath1 m flux density needs only be greater than 1.25 jy , implying a maximum @xmath8(60 @xmath1m)@xmath25(100 @xmath1 m ) ratio of 1.55 .",
    "ulirgs very rarely have 60 @xmath1 m to 100 @xmath1 m flux density ratios this high , such that the volume limit imposed by the upper redshift cutoff is more stringent than the flux density cutoff , resulting in a sample that is mostly volume - limited rather than flux - limited . taking the 64 ulirgs defined in the northern 2 jy sample of @xcite ,",
    "one finds an average @xmath8(60 @xmath1m)@xmath25(100 @xmath1 m ) ratio of @xmath26 , with a median value of 0.86 and a maximum of 1.64 ( in iras  08572@xmath273915 ) , which is the only ratio exceeding the maximum of 1.55 compatible with the volume - limited case .",
    "the ulirg from the northern 2 jy sample with the second highest ratio is iras  05246@xmath270103 , with @xmath8(60 @xmath1m)@xmath25(100 @xmath1m)@xmath28 . both of these galaxies",
    "are contained in the present sample .",
    "the redshift limit excludes many of the highest luminosity ulirgs , as these are most likely found at larger distances .",
    "for instance , mrk  1014a quasar and a ulirg  would be a member of the sample if not for the upper redshift limit .    of the 35 ulirgs in the redshift survey of @xcite satisfying the above conditions , two are not included here for the following reasons .",
    "the spectra of iras  21396@xmath273623 show this galaxy to be at a redshift of @xmath29 , rather than the previously reported @xmath30 .",
    "iras  19297@xmath310406 was free of any discernible lines , which may be the result of improper pointing , producing the spectrum of a nearby star in the very crowded field .",
    "therefore the entire sample contains 33 galaxies , and is very nearly complete in the volume - limited sense .",
    "a list of the sample galaxies appears in table  [ tab : sample ] .",

    "a few galaxies , such as iras  14348@xmath311447 and iras  14394@xmath275332 have excess emission on the blue side of the pa@xmath2 line , but in both cases there appears to be emission from contributing significantly to this flux , and no appreciable emission on the red side of the narrow pa@xmath2 profile .",

    "the apparent broad base on the pa@xmath2 line in the southwestern nucleus of iras  12112@xmath270305 may be spurious , as this is the one galaxy in the sample whose spectra were not calibrated by a g star observation , but rather by a template atmospheric spectrum .",

    "the fraction of the total line emission that is unresolved can be estimated for each ulirg by computing the flux contribution from a gaussian spatial profile having the width of the estimated seeing and sharing the maximum amplitude of the spatial line emission distribution .",
    "comparing this flux with the measured flux provides an upper limit to the fraction of light contained within an unresolved core .",
    "most of the primary ulirg nuclei are consistent with being unresolved , with a median seeing of 10 and a median physical resolution of 1.4  kpc .",
    "the scatter in the estimated fraction of unresolved flux is at the @xmath47720% level , mostly due to uncertainty in the seeing estimate .",
    "only 8 of the 33 ulirgs have estimated unresolved contributions lower than 80% , such that the majority of ulirgs contain most  if not all  of their pa@xmath2 emission within the central 1  kpc radius .",

    "counting only the 22 ulirgs with reliable extinction measures , the median visual extinction of @xmath487 mag corresponds to an extinction at pa@xmath2 of approximately one magnitude .",
    "this is a lower limit to the nuclear extinction because we can only estimate extinction to the gas we actually detect at 2 @xmath1 m , which very likely is peripheral to the nuclear region .",

    "for this purpose , we use the median qso spectrum presented in @xcite to represent the appearance of an unobscured quasar . identifying the region around 1.881 @xmath1 m ( @xmath559 km  s@xmath6 redward of the pa@xmath2 line center ) as being well away from the narrow pa@xmath2 emission , we measure the median qso flux density to be 22% higher than the qso continuum level .",
    "it is found that the broad pa@xmath2 emission from an exposed qso contributing half the bolometric luminosity of a ulirg would be comparable at 1.881 @xmath1 m to the typical ulirg continuum emission ( neglecting the contribution from the qso continuum ) .",
    "therefore , hiding the presence of the broad emission requires an attenuation factor that is comparable to the signal - to - noise ratio of the ulirg continuum . in the case of the median ulirg spectrum presented in @xcite ,",
    "this translates to an extinction at pa@xmath2 of 4.4 mag , and therefore a visual extinction , @xmath560 mag .",
    "the spectra of the individual ulirgs presented here typically have continuum signal - to - noise ratios around 20 , so that @xmath561 mag , or @xmath56225 mag of extinction is required to hide a qso at half the ulirg luminosity .",
    "details on this calculation appear in appendix  [ qsoextinct ] .",
    "the estimates of extinction made in this way are conservative in two regards .",
    "first , the aperture photometry of ulirgs used to establish typical continuum flux densities are based on 5@xmath563 apertures , such that extra flux is included from diffuse emission away from the nucleus . in smaller apertures corresponding to the spectral extractions employed in this paper ,",
    "the ulirg continuum is diminished , while the spatially unresolved qso component would be hardly affected , thus increasing the qso - to - ulirg contrast considerably , making the qso more difficult to conceal .",
    "the second conservative aspect is that the criterion of forcing the broad pa@xmath2 from the qso to lie at the 1@xmath483 level on the ulirg continuum would not hide the broad emission very effectively , the reason being that the 1@xmath483 level is computed for a single pixel ( one - quarter of a resolution element ) .",
    "when summed over a few resolution elements ( i.e. , up to the narrow shoulder of the pa@xmath2 line ) , the broad signal would stand out at more than the 3@xmath483 level .",
    "the result that , given the current level of sensitivity , at least 25 magnitudes of visual extinction are required to obscure a qso in a typical ulirg , together with the paucity of detections of low - level broad line emission  especially evident in the median spectrum of @xcite  leads us to conclude that agn are either rare in ulirgs , or very deeply buried .",
    "there are five ulirgs in the present sample with measured extinctions based on the pa@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio that are high enough to hide agn without requiring additional attenuation .",
    "we are unable to determine the likelihood that the rest of the ulirgs have the requisite nuclear extinctions to hide the presence of agn .",
    "the technique of comparing ulirg spectra to a typical qso spectrum can also be used to estimate the extinction to the broad - line region seen in iras  15462@xmath310405 .",
    "based on the flux density at 1.881 @xmath1 m , the pa@xmath2 emission contributes an additional 9% to the continuum level , some of which is likely continuum emission from the qso itself . correcting for this",

    ", the 10 kpc velocities would be approximately 400 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "it is very difficult to reproduce the small observed relative velocities among ulirgs with simple physical models  with or without large halos .",
    "ulirgs are massive , gas rich galaxies with rotation velocities and near - infrared absolute magnitudes characteristic of galaxies at least as massive as the milky way .",
    "the highest observed relative velocity in this sample is a mere 120 km  s@xmath6 , though the observed distribution is consistent with a typical deprojected velocity difference of 200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "some ulirgs have been observed with velocity differences very near this value ( e.g. , iras  20046@xmath330623 ; iras  19252@xmath337245 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but none are seen near the 400 km  s@xmath6 value as expected from a variety of physical predictions .",
    "one possibility deserves mention , which is that during the late - merger state , eccentric orbits may conspire with the delay in coordinating the accumulation of fuel for a nuclear starburst in such a way as to select ulirgs at the apocenters of their orbits , when velocities are low .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig : mihos ] , during the final merger process ( well after the initial encounter ) , the nuclear orbits are very eccentric , owing to the removal of angular momentum , largely by tidal debris .",
    "the very high velocity peaks near 500 km  s@xmath6 are associated with the close passages .",
    "if the ultraluminous activity is episodic in nature , with relatively short duration bursts occurring in reaction to transitory tidal disruptions , then the ulirgs we see may represent stages shortly after these close encounters . a finite time is required to organize gas motions in response to the close encounter , with the ultraluminous activity turning on only after a significant gas concentration has been established .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine in this scenario that the gas  moving more slowly than the galaxy , but with less distance to travel  will reach the nucleus at approximately the same time that the galaxies reach apocenter .",
    "keeping in mind that we are discussing the events occurring after the second close encounter , the orbital timescale is @xmath603 yr , such that apocenter is reached a few@xmath604 yr after close approach .",
    "this timescale is in rough agreement with expectations of the dynamical timescale within a few kpc of the nucleus  the region from which the fuel for the nuclear event is gathered . during the final merger process , it is possible that several ultraluminous bursts occur following close interactions of the nuclei .",
    "the idea of repetitive starbursts in the final stages of merging was first explored by @xcite , though in the context of cloud - cloud collisions in this case .",
    "the scheme proposed here of delayed  and potentially episodic  bursting would bias late - merger ulirgs to larger separations and therefore lower velocities , quite possibly consistent with the observed distribution .",
    "the problem with first encounter ulirgs remains , since the average first encounter velocity is around 475 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately the current sample is not large enough to probe possible differences in the velocity distributions of early and late ulirg encounters .",
    "near - infrared spectra in the 2 @xmath1 m window have been obtained for a nearly complete , volume - limited sample of 33 ulirgs .",
    "lines of atomic hydrogen and helium recombination , molecular hydrogen vibration - rotation , [ , and [ are seen in the spectra .",
    "the pa@xmath2 is predominantly seen as a nuclear event , with the majority of the emission arising in the central kpc of most ulirgs . initiated as a search for optically hidden active galactic nuclei , this survey reveals only two such galaxies , both of which are characterized as seyfert galaxies based on visible - light spectra .",
    "it is found via comparison of the pa@xmath2 and br@xmath3 lines that significant extinction of several magnitudes persists into the near - infrared bands , such that buried active nuclei can not be ruled out in many objects .",
    "it is estimated that with the sensitivity of the current survey , at least 25 mag of visual extinction would be needed to hide a qso with half the bolometric luminosity of the ulirg .",
    "strong molecular hydrogen emission is seen in all of the primary nuclear spectra .",
    "the molecular hydrogen spectrum indicates that most h@xmath40 emission in ulirgs stems from thermal excitation rather than fluorescent processes .",
    "some ulirgs appear to have a small fraction of their molecular hydrogen emission owing to fluorescence , though none approach pure fluorescence .",
    "the relative radial velocities found in this sample of ulirgs does not exceed @xmath605 km  s@xmath6 , with an inferred maximum deprojected velocity differential of around 200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this relatively low velocity differential is difficult to produce from interactions between galaxies with masses comparable to that of the milky way using simple physical assumptions .",
    "it is suggested that ulirgs in the late stages of merging may be selectively found near the time of apocenter , leading to a lower average relative velocity between nuclei .",
    "we thank michael strauss for his role in defining the sample of ulirgs , and for participating in the early stages of the caltech effort in studying the 2 jy ulirgs .",

    "the line properties reported in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] represent measured values from the spectra , rather than gaussian fit parameters . especially for the weaker lines ,",
    "the quality of the continuum subtraction is vital to proper line characterization .",
    "this is done with a simultaneous multiple gaussian line fit and quadratic continuum fit . in all but a few cases , this results in a very close fit to the continuum .",
    "for those few cases where the continuum fit is questionable , some of the weaker lines are excluded from tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] .",
    "all of the fitting procedures make use of the noise estimate computed on a pixel - by - pixel basis , as described earlier . in the end",
    ", the noise is scaled slightly ( typically by factors of less than 30% ) in order to make the final reduced chi - squared value equal to one .",
    "the scaled noise is used in estimating errors on the values in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] .",
    "each of the line parameters is computed based on the following line definition procedure .",
    "each potential line is searched for by summing two resolution elements ( 7 pixels ) of information around the line center , and determining if there is emission above the continuum exceeding 2.5@xmath483 . for lines satisfying this condition ,",
    "cutoffs are established on the red and blue sides of the line center by the following rules :    1 .",
    "if the spectrum extends below the continuum level , establish a cutoff , including only positive valued points .",
    "if there exists a local minimum , followed by at least three higher points , assume that the following points belong to another line and exclude them , keeping only the minimum point .",
    "3 .   if the next two pixels are between 01@xmath483 above the continuum , include them and quit .",
    "these procedures obviously can not practice the same discrimination that a diligent scientist might , but we find that a reasonable job is performed  especially on lines whose boundaries are obvious to the eye .",
    "nonetheless , lines with a final computed equivalent width measuring less than 2.5@xmath483 are typically excluded , though those that appear to be real in the one - dimensional spectra are preserved .",
    "conversely , a few lines with reported detections greater than 2.5@xmath483 are excluded on the basis of either poor local continuum fit or simply less - than - believable results .    because the weaker lines do not have a well defined full - width at half - maximum , the fwhm values in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] are based on a combination of line flux and peak amplitude .",
    "if a gaussian shape is assumed , the fwhm of the line would be equal to the line flux divided by the peak amplitude , times the proportionality constant of @xmath606 .",
    "performed in this manner , it is relatively simple to compute the error of such an estimate .",
    "a strict measure of the fwhm is provided in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] for the pa@xmath2 line in each galaxy for comparison to the value estimated by this technique .",
    "all of the reported fwhm values have been reduced to intrinsic line widths by subtracting the instrumental resolution in quadrature .",
    "each spectrum uses the measured line widths in the wavelength calibration spectrum as a basis for the decomposition .",
    "values in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] for which the measured line width is exceeded by the instrumental width are listed as unresolved lines of zero width .",
    "almost all of the lines in this survey are resolved , typically around 200300 km  s@xmath6 in width .",
    "the velocity measurements in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] are indicated relative to pa@xmath2 , though the pa@xmath2 velocity itself is expressed as a direct quantity in km  s@xmath6 .",
    "these values are simply computed as first - moment measures in the spectral lines , with error estimates computed from the noise estimates in a straightforward way .",
    "added to this error estimate is a wavelength calibration error , assumed to be 1015 km  s@xmath6 , and a slit placement error .",
    "the latter uncertainty attempts to estimate the wavelength offset induced by a non - uniform slit illumination . when the line source is spatially compact enough to produce a discernible peak somewhere in the slit , the location of this peak within the slit influences the ultimate wavelength associated with this emission .",
    "for these purposes , it is assumed that the line source has a real physical size roughly half that of the continuum , which is almost always spatially resolved .",
    "further , it is assumed that the source is centered in the slit with a gaussian 1@xmath483 placement error of one - quarter of a slit width .",
    "only cases of exceptional seeing result in an appreciable error from this source , with a median error estimate of 15 km  s@xmath6 and a maximum of 38 km  s@xmath6 . despite the accounting of uncertainties ,",
    "the velocities indicate a dispersion outside of the error budgets that is not correlated with line species or grating setting .",
    "it may well be that the variable spectral range over which the line is summed is largely responsible for determining the offset , as the range is biased to contain only positive points , and will extend as far as possible from the line center to include such points . with the large moments generated from distant points , the estimated velocity may wander far from its true center .",
    "thus the values of velocity in tables  [ tab : mofoprim ] and [ tab : mofosec ] , especially for weaker lines , are perhaps of little use .",
    "gaussian fit centers may do a better job of appropriately representing the line velocities .",
    "the median qso spectrum is constructed from nine optically identified qsos in the redshift range @xmath607 , seven of which have available @xmath18 band photometry . comparing the absolute @xmath18 band magnitudes to bolometric luminosities of the quasars ,",
    "one finds the approximate relation @xmath608 .",
    "the median infrared luminosity of the 31 non - agn ulirgs in the present sample is @xmath609 .",
    "a qso within a ulirg that contributes half of the bolometric luminosity  most of which is reprocessed into the infrared  would then have @xmath610 , or @xmath611 mag .",
    "this establishes the @xmath18 band flux density of the qso continuum . at a rest wavelength of 1.881 @xmath1 m , corresponding to @xmath612 km  s@xmath6 in velocity",
    ", it is found that the median qso has an excess flux density due to pa@xmath2 measuring 22% of the baseline continuum level @xcite .",
    "thus the absolute magnitude of the line emission at this velocity is @xmath613 mag .",
    "typical ulirg continuum levels can be approximated in a similar way as that above , using 5@xmath563 aperture photometry of the sample galaxies where available @xcite .",
    "eight of the 31 non - agn ulirgs have @xmath75 measurements , and comparing to the infrared luminosity ( 81000 @xmath1 m ) leads to the relation @xmath614 .",
    "therefore the typical non - agn ulirg in this sample , with a median luminosity @xmath615 , has @xmath616 mag .",
    "the expected ratio of broad pa@xmath2 to the ulirg continuum at 1.881 @xmath1 m is then 0.92 , with the 1@xmath483 range extending from 0.44 to 1.91 .",
    "if a given ulirg has a spectrum with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath617 , then diminishing the qso pa@xmath2 to the 1@xmath483 level requires@xmath618 where @xmath619 represents qso contributions to continuum and line flux , @xmath620 is the ulirg continuum contribution , and @xmath621 is the attenuating factor . with the additional relations that @xmath622 and @xmath623 , we find that the required attenuation is @xmath624 , or @xmath625 magnitudes at pa@xmath2 .",
    "the visual extinction is roughly 7 times this value .",
    "the specific mechanism responsible for the h@xmath40 emission can be investigated via population diagrams . by accounting for various degeneracies , transition probabilities , and photon energy ,",
    "one may compute the relative populations of the upper states of each transition based on the observed line flux .",
    "in pure thermal equilibrium , the population levels will follow an exponential profile with respect to upper state energy .",
    "more formally , the intensity of a given transition is described by@xmath626 where the upper and lower states are denoted by the 1 and 2 subscripts , @xmath627 represents vibration state , @xmath628 the rotation state , @xmath629 the ortho / para degeneracy , @xmath630 the transition probability , @xmath631 the emitted photon frequency , @xmath632 the upper state energy , and @xmath633 the equilibrium temperature .",
    "therefore a logarithmic plot of the line intensities divided by the terms multiplying the exponential above produces a linear relation against the upper energy scale with a slope proportional to the inverse of the temperature .",
    "the physical parameters for selected @xmath18 band transitions are given in table  [ tab : h2phys ] .",
