    "most objects at cosmological distances ( stars , galaxies , agn ) display evolution of their observable properties with redshift . since gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "are thought to originate in the core - collapse of massive stars and are observed over a wide range in redshift , it is reasonable to suppose that they might also evolve .    since the advent of rapid grb localizations with and , and the consequent follow - up observations , over @xmath0 grbs have reported redshift measurements . using 9 bursts from @xcite , plus an additional 11 bursts localized with ,",
    "@xcite have been able to strengthen earlier indications that grbs are brighter at higher redshifts .",
    "a uniform - jet model proposed by @xcite has been shown to provide a unified picture of grbs and xrfs .",
    "considering all bursts to have a `` standard energy '' but a range of jet opening solid - angles that spans five orders of magnitude , this unified jet model can account for the full range of observed burst properties seen by . here",
    "we extend this unified jet model to account for redshift evolution and show that it can also explain the observed properties of batse bursts .",
    "analysis of the batse catalog has revealed evidence that grbs may evolve strongly with redshift . the use of redshift estimators based on burst variability has provided evidence that bursts are intrinsically brighter at larger redshifts than at smaller @xcite . analyzing a set of 9 grbs with spectroscopically determined redshifts observed by the bepposax satellite ,",
    "@xcite also claim evidence for an increase in the isotropic - equivalent energy ( @xmath1 ) with redshift , but they did not include a discussion of possible threshold selection effects .    recent results from hete-2",
    "strengthen the evidence for this relationship .",
    "figure 2 from @xcite shows the isotropic - equivalent energies @xmath1 and luminosities @xmath2 as a function of redshift for the hete-2 and bepposax events . after correcting for threshold effects",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath1 is correlated with redshift at the @xmath3% confidence level , and @xmath4 is correlated with redshift at the @xmath5% confidence level .",
    "the observed relationship goes roughly as @xmath6 .",
    "the unified jet model of grbs and xrfs @xcite provides a natural explanation for redshift evolution in grbs .",
    "namely , each burst exhibits a `` standard energy '' @xcite , but the possible range of jet opening angles varies from fairly large values at low redshift , to very small values at high redshift , according to the relationship given above .",
    "that is , evolution in @xmath1 is explained by an evolution of the jet opening solid - angle , @xmath7 .",
    "values reported by @xcite , shown with the best - fit gaussian . _",
    "right : _ displacement of @xmath8 values from the best - fit central value as a function of redshift . from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   values reported by @xcite , shown with the best - fit gaussian .",
    "_ right : _ displacement of @xmath8 values from the best - fit central value as a function of redshift . from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the burst simulations that we have implmented to test the unified jet model also provide a powerful way to explore models including burst evolution with redshift . for each burst , we obtain : ( 1 ) a redshift z by drawing from a model of the star - formation rate @xcite , and ( 2 ) a jet - opening solid angle @xmath9 by drawing from specific distribution range in @xmath9 that is fixed at @xmath10 and shifts to smaller values at higher redshifts .",
    "we also introduce three gaussian smearing functions to generate : ( 1 ) a spread in jet energy ( @xmath8 , see figure [ egamma ] ) , ( 2 ) a spread in @xmath11 around the @xmath1-@xmath11 relation , and ( 3 ) a spread in the timescale t that converts fluence to flux . using these five quantities",
    ", we calculate various rest - frame quantities ( @xmath1 , @xmath11 , etc . ) , and finally , we construct a band function for each burst and transform it to the observer frame , which allows us to calculate fluences and peak fluxes and determine if the burst would be detected by various instruments ( see figure [ z1_eiso]a ) .    to obtain the model presented here , we sought to roughly match the observed distribution in the ( @xmath12 , @xmath1)-plane ( compare figure [ z1_eiso]b with figure 2 of @xcite ) , which displays a range in @xmath1 of @xmath13 to @xmath14 ergs at @xmath10 and @xmath15 to @xmath16 ergs at @xmath17 . assuming the faintest burst at @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath18 , this translates into a range of @xmath19 of @xmath20 to @xmath21 steradians at @xmath10 and @xmath22 to @xmath23 steradians at @xmath17 .",
    "the observed values of @xmath8 are taken from @xcite , and their distribution is well - fit by narrow gaussian @xcite ( see figure [ egamma]a ) .",
    "figure [ egamma]b plots the displacement of these values from the central value as a function of redshift and shows no evidence for evolution of @xmath8 with redshift @xcite .",
    "this rules out the possibility that redshift evolution might be explained by an evolution of the `` standard energy '' .",
    "since it relies on the random distribution of burst jet axes with respect to the viewing angle , the universal structured - jet model can not easily accommodate redshift evolution .",
    "the only solution would be for the `` jet energy '' , @xmath8 , to evolve with redshift , but that would make it difficult to explain figure 1 and the results of @xcite .",
    "figure [ cuml_dist ] compares the cumulative distributions of four observable burst quantities against several possible models .",
    "we find that the uniform jet model with burst evolution can adequately describe the observed distributions of localized bursts .",
    "in addition , adding evolution to the uniform jet model replicates the observed distribution of peak photon number fluxes as observed by batse .",
    "models without redshift evolution ( figure [ batse]a , dotted curve ) tend to overpredict the number of high peak flux bursts .",
    "however , models with strong evolution ( solid curve ) provide excellent agreement with the batse distribution .",
    "figure [ batse]b shows the differential distribution of redshifts ( for bursts detected by wxm ) for the models with and without redshift evolution .",
    "this model makes several predictions .",
    "most observed xrfs are predicted to be at @xmath24 .",
    "bursts at low @xmath25 have @xmath26 or @xmath27 a few degrees .",
    "we require a value of the `` standard energy '' to be @xmath28 ergs , or about @xmath29 times less than the value reported by @xcite .",
    "thus , the fraction of type ic supernovae producing grbs increases from @xmath30% at @xmath10 to @xmath31% at @xmath32 . finally , @xmath33% of bursts with @xmath34 are detected by the wxm .",

    "hete-2 has strengthened the evidence that grbs evolve with z. the uniform jet model can describe xrfs and grbs and can accommodate evolution whereas the universal jet model can not .",
    "confirmation of this model will require the localization of many more xrfs , the determination of @xmath11 and @xmath1 for many more xrfs and grbs , and the identification of optical afterglows and the measurement of redshifts for these bursts .",
