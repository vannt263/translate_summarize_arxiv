    "the ultra - long - period cepheids ( ulpcs ) are defined as classical fundamental mode cepheids with pulsating period longer that 80  days ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are located at the bright end of the period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation defined by the classical , shorter period cepheids , but follow a flatter p - l relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that , together with their intrinsic brightness of @xmath4mag , the ulpcs can be used as standard candle to find distances up to @xmath5  mpc and beyond using current and future space - based telescopes ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies with distance determined from ulpcs can then be used to calibrate a number of secondary distance indicators , such as tully - fisher relations and type ia supernovae , that are well within the hubble flow .",
    "@xcite listed 18 ulpcs from 6 galaxies in the local and sculptor groups , most of them are dwarf or irregular galaxies .",
    "@xcite include 19 additional ulpcs from 4 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "surprisingly , none of these galaxies include m31  the nearest spiral galaxy .",
    "a number of investigators has suggested to use m31 as the calibrating , or anchoring , galaxy in distance scale determination ( for example , see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "as the importance of m31 in distance scale work is increasing , it is necessary to search and calibrate the ulpcs in m31 . in this work ,",
    "we report our finding of ulpc candidates in m31 using the imaging data taken from the palomar transient factory project .",
    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf , @xcite ) is one of the leading survey project in time - domain astronomy .",
    "the aim of ptf is to discover transients in the universe , including various types of supernovae as well as other exotic and rare transient events . on average",
    ", ptf is now finding one transient every 20 minutes and one strong variable ( with variation greater than 10% ) every 10 minutes .",
    "the ptf data can also be used to study other time - varying objects , such as different types of variable stars and asteroids .",
    "ptf utilizes the 48-inch samuel oschin telescope ( also known as p48 ) at palomar observatory for discovering the transients , and follow - up mainly by the p60 telescope ( for photometric light and color curves ) and other large aperture telescopes within the ptf network ( for spectroscopic classification , including palomar 200-inch telescope and keck telescopes ) .",
    "the wide - field p48 schmidt telescope has been used for the famous palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) to map out the entire northern sky with photographic plates .",
    "today , the robotic p48 is equipped with a cfh12k mosaic camera that has been redesigned to fit the telescope .",
    "the pixel size of the ccd camera is 1.01  arcsec / pixel , with 11 operable ccd arrays , giving a @xmath17.26  deg@xmath2 field - of - view ( fov ) in total ( see figure  [ fig_m31 ] ) .",
    "most of the ptf observations on p48 telescope are done in mould @xmath6-band filter , with occasionally use the @xmath7 or @xmath8 filters .",
    "the nightly images taken for p48 telescope are processed with standard image - reduction procedures , which include bias subtraction , flat - fielding , artifact flagging , and astrometric and photometric calibration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the processed images are archived in a database at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , which is accessible only by ptf - collaboration members .",
    "the ptf data is ideal for the search of ulpcs in m31 .",
    "this is because the fov of p48 is able to cover the entire m31 in a single exposure , as shown in figure  [ fig_m31 ] .",
    "furthermore , m31 has been substantially observed by p48 since the beginning of 2009 , whenever it is visible , with a time resolution of up to 1 day .",
    "two sets of data are available from ptf data archive , with ptf field i d  # 4445 and # 100043 , respectively . in this work , we specifically downloaded images with ptf field i d  # 4445 to search for the ulpcs .",
    "this particular m31 data set was observed starting on 17 january 2010 and ending on 31 january 2012 , with a total of 172 frames .",
    "after downloading the reduced images from ipac , we performed image subtraction following the difference imaging analysis ( dia ) proposed by @xcite for each ccd as follows .",
    "first of all , to get rid of the shifts and rotations between images , we registered all the images onto an astrometric reference , which was chosen to be the best - seeing image from all of the available times ( the seeing distribution of the images is presented in figure  [ fig.psf ] ) .",
    "then , we re - mapped all the images to this astrometric reference with a second - degree polynomial interpolation along both image horizontal ( @xmath9-axis ) and vertical ( @xmath10-axis ) dimensions .

    "\\end{array}$ ]    the next step was to build a reference image for the image subtraction from the 10 best - seeing images from all times .",
    "since these images were taken at different seeing conditions , they were psf - convolved to remove seeing variations and coadded to generate the reference image .",
    "we then applied the image subtraction to all images .",
    "as part of this process , the reference image was convolved with a psf kernel to match to each image .",
    "we subdivided each image into 36 pieces , with 6 sub - divisions along the @xmath9-axis and 6 sub - divisions along the @xmath10-axis , and constructed the kernel for each sub - division , in order to account for the spatially varying kernel .",
    "after image subtraction , we built light - curves from the difference images .",
    "to search for ulpc candidates , we applied various selection criteria to the light - curves .",
    "these selection criteria are described as follows .",
    "* _ cut using magnitude range _ : we utilized the p - l relation to derive the intrinsic brightnesses of cepheids with periods longer than 80 days , and scaled their brightnesses to the distance of m31 , in order to estimate their expected magnitudes . to extract sources that are in the magnitude range of ulpcs",
    ", we used sextractor to extract stars in the reference image and calibrated the magnitude zero point of the reference image relative to the local group survey ( lgs ) catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then drew the light - curves on sources with magnitudes between 17.5 and 19.5 , where the p - l relation predicts cepheids with a period of 80 days to have a magnitude of around 18 .",
    "we intentionally set the faint limit of the magnitude range to be 19.5 , in order to incorporate the intergalactic and intrinsic extinction in the m31 line of sight . *",
    "_ cut using power from analysis of variance ( aov ) _ : after identifying point sources within the adopted magnitude range , we applied the aov algorithm ( @xcite ) , which is ideal for period searches in unevenly sampled light - curves . from inspection of some light - curves",
    ", we empirically required the power from aov to fall between 0.5 and 0.9 . *",
    "_ cut using period _ : we utilized the aov algorithm to find the preliminary period of each of the resolved sources within our adopted magnitude range .",
    "we allowed aov to search for periodicity between 1 and 500 days . because we are looking for ulpcs , we filtered out sources with periods of less than 80 days and larger than 300 days .",
    "the surviving sources from this and the previous cuts then formed the subset of ulpc candidates subject to the next , final exploratory cut , which is further eye - inspection . *",
    "_ cut using eye inspection _ : we still need to use human - eyes to identify the most likely ulpc candidates . in this step , we folded light - curves survived from the previous cuts , and inspected them by eye to see if they indicate prominent ulpc variabilities .    the numbers of surviving candidates after applying the aforementioned cuts",
    "are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "ultimately , 8 candidates were identified in our dataset .",
    "figures  [ fig.lc ] presents light - curves for these 8 candidates , while their locations relative to m31 can be seen in figure  [ fig_m31 ] .",

    "however , one should keep in mind that the dispersions of p - l relations for ulpcs are @xmath50 larger than the cepheid counterparts @xcite . inspecting figure  [ fig_m31 ]",
    "suggests that this candidate may be located at the back , or far - side , of m31 , which could suffer from a depth - effect and/or higher extinction .",
    "the @xmath6-band absolute magnitude for this candidate falls on the p - l relation defined by the galactic cepheids ( figure  [ fig.pl ] ) .",
    "the @xmath14 value for this candidate is also consistent with ulpcs ( figure  [ fig.deb ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the candidate is quite low as compared to other candidates .",
    "this candidate may be an ulpc evolving off or near the instability strip of ulpcs .",
    "no counterpart was found in simbad database for this candidate .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive search for m31 ulpcs using ptf data that was acquired over a time period of approximately 2 years . benefiting from the large fov , high cadence , and long time - baseline of the ptf observing strategy",
    ", we have been able to surpass previous m31 monitoring campaigns and trace ulpcs even out to the halo of m31 .",
    "we have utilized a difference image method to reveal source variability in crowded stellar fields , and focused on point sources in the magnitude range of ulpcs inferred by p - l relation .",
    "we have selected 8 candidates , and performed fourier - decomposition to derive their mean magnitude , amplitude , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 from @xmath6-band light - curves . among the 8 candidates , we characterized 3 of the most promising ulpc candidates by their location on the p - l relation , @xmath14 vs.  period , and @xmath6-band amplitude vs.  period parameter plane . the mean @xmath6-band absolute magnitude for these 3 candidates , calibrated using the distance modulus of m31 from @xcite ,",
    "is @xmath3mag ( with a dispersion of @xmath51mag ) .",
    "two of the candidates ( 8 - 0326 & 8 - 1498 ) have been reported before ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , periods reported from @xcite for these 2 candidates do not agree with the periods we found here ( table  [ tab2 ] ) . inspecting the light curves presented in @xcite reveal that their light curves do not represent the full pulsation cycle of these 2 candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig.wrongp ] presents the folded light curves using our data but with @xcite s periods , none of them exhibit cepheid - like or ulpc - like light curves .",
    "the third candidate , 7 - 1326 , is a new discovery , probably due to it s low amplitude .",
    "confirmation of the ulpc nature of these 3 candidates has to await the availability of @xmath37 and @xmath38 band light - curves , from which the accurate mean @xmath52-band magnitudes can be deduced .",
    "the mean @xmath52-band magnitudes are important in constructing the color - magnitude diagram and the extinction - free wesenheit function , defined as @xmath53 , for these candidates , so that they can be compared to the known ulpcs as given in @xcite .",
    "the period - wesenheit ( pw ) plot for these candidates is particularly important because the dispersion of the pw relation for ulpcs is much smaller than that of @xmath52-band p - l relations ( @xcite ) .",
    "ulpcs are evolved stars with mass between @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( @xcite ) ; hence , the number of ulpcs in a given galaxy will not be many .",
    "therefore , it is not a surprise that only a few ulpc candidates were found in this work ( for comparison , only two ulpcs were found in m81 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the ulpc candidates found in this work are distributed farther away from the m31 center , as shown in figure  [ fig_m31 ] .",
    "this can be partially attributed to high - level background from m31 itself and shallower photometry from the relatively short exposure time of ptf data ( 60  s per image ) .",
    "the high - level background of m31 also brings up concern about the issue of source blending and/or crowding .",
    "this is because the m31 background consists of numerous stars , and at the distance of m31 , each pixel can contain many more than a single star ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the crowding issue is severer for p48 , because the pixel size is 1.01  arcsec and the average seeing is about 2.5  arcsec ( see figure  [ fig.psf ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the crowding issue can be solved by adopting an image - subtraction algorithm , as we did in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the issue of blending is hard to tackle with since the pixel size and the site seeing of p48 are huge compared to other m31 monitoring campaigns . to have a precise estimation of the influence of blending",
    ", one can follow the steps of @xcite , where they compared _ hst _ images and ground - based observations to infer the blending effects in m33 . however , this is beyond the scope of the aim of this work .",
    "in addition , the ulpcs found in this work are rather bright compared to normal cepheids , which will be less affected by blending from near - by stars .",
    "this work was partly supported by the nsc grants : nsc101 - 2119-m-008 - 007-my3 and nsc101 - 2628-m-008 - 003 .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
