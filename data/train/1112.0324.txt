    "observations show that nearby galaxies are missing most of their baryons ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .  2005 ; heymans et al .  2006 ; mandelbaum et al",
    "2006 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2007 ; jiang & kochanek 2007 ; bregman 2007 ) when compared to the cosmological baryon to matter ratio ( e.g. , @xmath2 from wmap , dunkley et al .  2009 ) .",
    "for example , the milky way is missing two thirds of its baryon allotment ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .  2003 ) and less massive galaxies have retained less than 10% of their baryons ( e.g. , corbelli 2003 ; walker et al .",
    "this situation is confirmed in other galaxies through a variety of methods ( e.g. , hoekstra et al . 2005 ; mcgaugh 2007 ) .",
    "however , most of these studies do not include the baryon mass in the hot gas halo of galaxies , and it is possible that the majority of the missing baryons in galaxies actually resides in their hot has halos based on theoretical predictions ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ; sommer - larsen 2006 ; fukugita & peebles 2006 ; also see the review by benson 2010 ) .",
    "this component can be difficult to detect for spiral galaxies due to its faintness , especially if the gas density profile is flat . as another possibility",
    ", the missing baryons from galaxies may have escaped from the potential wells of the galaxies but reside in their parent groups or clusters ( e.g. , humphrey et al .",
    "finally , the missing baryons can be in the form of warm - hot intergalactic medium ( cen & okstiker 1999 ; 2006 ) .",
    "deep x - ray observations are needed to distinguish these different scenarios .",
    "the situation is different for rich galaxy clusters , where the gas mass dominates the baryon content , and the baryon fractions in these massive systems are close to the cosmological value after combining the gas and stellar baryon contributions ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .  2006 ; allen et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the measurements of the baryon fraction in different systems suggest that the fraction depends on the dynamical mass of the systems : rich clusters retain their cosmological allotment of baryons , while galaxies are baryon - poor .",
    "we summarize the situation in dai et al .",
    "( 2010 ) by combining the archival data points reported in the literature and our stacking analysis result using the rosat all - sky survey data of 4,000 nearby galaxy groups and clusters ( dai et al .",
    "we find that the baryon fractions from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters can be fit by a broken power - law model with the break at the circular velocity of @xmath3 .",
    "the scatter of the fractions about the mean relation is small considering the huge dynamic range of the systems . further examining the relation",
    ", we find that the baryon fractions are similar for different systems with similar total masses but different compositions .",
    "for example , the baryon fractions of poor galaxy groups , where the baryon mass is still dominated by the gas mass , are close to those of massive galaxies , where the baryon mass is dominated by the stellar mass .",
    "such a coincidence is puzzling considering the differences between their mass compositions and energy feedback mechanisms .    to test whether the missing baryons reside in galaxy halos and further constrain the baryon loss in different mass scales ,",
    "we focus on the massive galaxy ugc  12591 .",
    "ugc  12591  is a spiral galaxy with the largest measured rotational velocity to date ( 466 - 500 km / sec , giovanelli et al .",
    "1986 ; paturel 2003 ) . to appreciate this galaxy ,",
    "its optical - ir luminosity is nine times that of m31 .",
    "nine big spirals were in a single group is richer than hickson groups and is about half of the fornax cluster , but much more compact . in this paper , we combine our _ xmm - newton _  observation of ugc  12591  with 2mass and other data to determine the baryon fraction and the composition of this massive spiral galaxy . throughout the paper ,",

    "we also applied a low energy flare filter to exclude flares in the 0.61.4 kev band ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",

    "the central region of ugc  12591  is clearly detected in x - rays in all pn and mos ccds .",

    "the _ xmm - newton _  background is composed of several components induced by soft protons , cosmic rays , galactic , and extra - galactic background photons ( e.g. , carter & read 2007 ) .",
    "after filtering the background flares in the hard and the soft energy bands , we had removed most of the variable soft proton background .",
    "we then extracted the spectrum from an outer annulus background region , and the remaining background components in this spectrum is from quiescent soft protons , cosmic rays , galactic , and extra - galactic background photons .",
    "the cosmic ray background can be subtracted by comparing the surface brightnesses in the outer ring and out - of - fov ( ofov ) regions .",
    "we can then decompose the contributions from the photon background and quiescent soft proton background through spectral analysis .",
    "we fixed the spectral index of the extra - galactic background as @xmath16 and galactic background with @xmath17  kev , and allowed the normalizations of these two components to vary during the spectral fits .",

    "the spectra are well fit by the combination of photon background , quiescent soft proton background , and residual metal emission lines .",
    "we estimated that the ratios between the quiescent soft proton background and photon background are 0.676 , 0.200 , and 0.087 for pn , mos1 , and mos2 , respectively , in the 0.61.4 kev band .",
    "after this step , we can scale the two components to inner regions using the corresponding vignetting profiles .",
    "we measured the surface brightness profile of ugc  12591  by extracting events in consecutive annuli of 0@xmath185 widths ( 13.6  kpc ) . for the region within 1  from the center , we further divided the annuli using 0@xmath1825 widths .",
    "we measured average exposure times within each annulus . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the surface brightness profile , we measured it in the soft x - ray ( 0.61.4 kev ) band .",
    "we first subtracted the surface brightness of the ofov region , which is un - vignetted , from the surface brightness profile .",
    "we then subtracted the photon and non - photon induced background based on our background decompositions obtained by fitting the outer background spectra .",
    "we plot the net surface brightness profiles and their uncertainties of ugc  12591  after correcting for vignetting measured from pn and mos ccds , in figures  [ fig : pn][fig : mtwo ] , respectively .",
    "ugc  12591  is detected out to @xmath193  in the pn data and @xmath191@xmath185 in the mos data .",
    "we also extracted the surface brightness profile of ugc  12591  in the hard x - ray band between 28 kev to measure the contribution from point sources .",
    "the hard component from point sources is detected to 1  and 0@xmath185 , respectively , in the pn and mos data .",
    "after scaling the 28 kev count rate to the 0.61.4 kev count rate for the point source contribution , assuming @xmath20 ( irwin et al .",
    "2003 ) , we found the contribution from point sources in the 0.61.4 kev band flux is 45% within the central 1  region .",
    "we extracted the central spectra of ugc  12591  within 50  from the pn and mos data .",
    "the background regions were chosen in a region with large off - axis angles to avoid possible contamination from the extended halo emission detected in ugc  12591 .",
    "we built the ` rmf ` and ` arf ` files separately for the source and background spectra .",
    "we modeled the source spectra by combining an apec model for the extended gas emission and a power - law model for point sources , modified by galactic absorption and absorption at the source .",
    "we fixed the photon index of the power - law component as @xmath20 and scaled its normalization based on the 28 kev count rate of the central 50  region , since the expected gas emission ( the apec model ) in this band is negligible .",
    "we also fixed the galactic absorption based on the value obtained by @xcite . since our spectra can not constrain the gas metallicity reliably , we fixed it at 0.5 solar metallicity .",

    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows our simultaneous fit to the pn and mos spectra using this model .",

    "the central source is possibly dominated by an agn .",

    "the agn / binary contribution can be measured using the surface brightness profiles from the 28 kev band , as described above .",
    "we estimated the x - ray emission from the stellar population ( excluding the binaries ) using the stellar mass to x - ray luminosity conversion factor of revnivtsev et al .",
    "this relation is calibrated for old stellar populations , and since ugc 12591 is fairly bulge - dominated , the relation should still work approximately . to compute the radial surface brightness profile from the stellar population in the x - ray band",
    ", we derived a k - band radial surface brightness profile from the k - band magnitudes within circles of different angular sizes for this galaxy listed in the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "we used a distance modulus of 35.0 and a k - band mass - to - light ratio of 0.6 ( bell and de jong 2001 ) for this galaxy , and then applied the revnivtsev et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : loglog ] shows the _ xmm - newton _  pn and mos data , after vignetting correction and background subtraction , as well as the estimates of the various components we fit to the surface brightness profile .",
    "it is clear that out to 30 or 40 kpc the x - ray binary and stellar components are insufficient to account for all the emission , and therefore that a hot halo component is necessary .",
    "we only allowed @xmath24-models for the hot gas if they can not be excluded at greater than 95% confidence .",
    "this results in a narrow range of acceptable fits for the hot halo profile .",
    "the true uncertainties in the surface brightness profile are probably somewhat larger than the statistical errors , however , due to inevitable systematic errors in the flat fielding and background subtraction .",
    "this means that the range of formally acceptable fits for the hot halo might be a little wider than we have indicated figure  [ fig : loglog ] .",
    "deviations from a simple @xmath24-model for the hot gas distribution are also possible , and we tested by adding a second flatter @xmath24 model component in our fits .",

    "the fit with the lowest enclosed mass contains @xmath46 with an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath47 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "we also examined the possibility of a higher - entropy halo as predicted by many simulations ( maller and bullock 2004 ; kaufmann et al .",
    "2009 ; crain et al .",
    "2010 ; guedes et al .",
    "such a halo would have a flatter density profile than the @xmath48 models we find above , and it would therefore be both more difficult to detect in emission and also more massive than a lower - entropy halo . as in anderson and bregman ( 2011 ) , we chose to model a flattened profile with a two - component fit to the data .",
    "the `` flattened '' component is a @xmath24-model with fixed @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc , but with free normalization , and the other component is a more concentrated @xmath24-model with all three parameters free , used to model the emission at smaller radii . for this galaxy",
    ", there is very little statistical space left to add a flattened profile , so the most mass that can be included by adding a flattened component is @xmath51 . as before , however , we caution that this statistical constraint depends on understanding all the systematic uncertainties perfectly , especially the background in _ xmm - newton _  pn / mos ccds",
    ". these profiles can be independently tested in absorption profiles instead of emission due with the linear dependence on density in absorption .",

    "the stellar mass component is still more important with @xmath80 within 500  kpc , or @xmath81 with the additional flatter gas component .    to summarize , combining our _ xmm - newton _  observation and the 2mass and radio data in the literature",

    "we plot ugc  12591  in the btf diagram together with the galaxies in mcgaugh ( 2005 ) and the other massive galaxy ngc1961 ( anderson & bregman 2011 ) with a rotational velocity of 402  in figure  [ fig : btf ] .",
    "anderson & bregman ( 2011 ) find that ngc1961 deviates slightly from the linear fits to btf .",

    ", we can estimate the cooling time of this hot halo and the implied accretion rate onto the galaxy , which can provide constraints on the gas available for new star formation .",
    "we define the cooling radius as the radius where the cooling time is 10  gyr , using the expression of the cooling time ( fukugita & peebles 2006 ) , @xmath95 where the latter expression assumes a primeval he abundance resulting in a total particle density of @xmath96 . for @xmath97",

    "for the range of best - fit @xmath24-model profiles constrained in this paper , this corresponds to a cooling radius between 15.6 and 18.0 kpc , and a hot halo mass of @xmath103 within that radius .",
    "we can roughly estimate the cooling time and rate by dividing the thermal energy in the hot gas within the cooling radius by the luminosity within that radius , and this yields a wide range in cooling time of 2.8 - 6.3 gyr for material within the cooling radius , but a fairly narrow range in the effective cooling rate of @xmath104 year@xmath14 .",
    "this halo accretion rate is two orders of magnitude too low to assemble the stellar mass of this galaxy within a hubble time .",
    "therefore , significant accretion must have occurred via some other mode , such as cold flows or mergers , to produce the stellar mass seen in this galaxy today , confirming the conclusion drew in ngc  1961 ( anderson & bregman 2011 ) .",

    "<S> we also measure the temperature of the hot gas as @xmath1  kev . combining our x - ray constraints and the near - infrared and radio measurements in the literature </S>",
    "<S> , we find a baryon mass fraction of 0.030.04 in ugc  12591 , suggesting a missing baryon mass of 75% compared with the cosmological mean value . </S>",
    "<S> combined with another recent measurement in ngc  1961 , the result strongly argues that the majority of missing baryons in spiral galaxies does not reside in their hot halos . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that ugc  12591 lies significantly below the baryonic tully - fisher relationship . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the baryon fractions of massive spiral galaxies are similar to those of galaxy groups with similar masses , indicating that the baryon loss is ultimately controlled by the gravitational potential well . the cooling radius of this gas halo is small , similar to ngc  1961 , which argues that the majority of stellar mass of this galaxy is not assembled as a result of cooling of this gas halo . </S>"
