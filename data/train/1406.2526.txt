    "metal enriched gaseous structures , such as normal star - forming galaxies , can lie along the line of sight between us and a quasar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these intervening galaxies are believed to give rise to absorption lines in an observed quasar spectrum , with the magnesium  ii ( mgii ) doublet appearing at @xmath42796 ,  2803   , in the rest - frame of the absorber .",
    "this lies in the optical from @xmath5  to  @xmath6 and serves as a probe of low - ionization gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detections of mgii absorption lines have therefore been used to infer the presence of an intervening system along the line of sight . in some cases",
    "these absorbers are associated with the quasar itself . however , in cases where the absorber is at a lower redshift than that of the quasar , the absorption is most likely taking place in an intervening galaxy between us and the quasar ( i.e.  a non - intrinsic system or an ` intervenor ' ) .",
    "faraday rotation is a powerful tool for measuring the magnetic field strength along the line of sight towards astrophysical objects .",
    "the combination of cosmic magnetic fields and charged particles causes rotation of the polarization angle of linearly polarized synchrotron emission from background radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "along a line of sight , the observed polarization angle is altered by an amount equal to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the observing wavelength , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the measured and intrinsic polarization angles respectively , and the constant of proportionality rm , the ` rotation measure ' , is generally related to the integrated product of the electron number density , @xmath11 , and the strength of the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight , @xmath12 .",
    "the observed rm is also related to the redshift at which the faraday rotating medium is located , but in practice this is typically a non - simple relationship , as there are actually multiple rotating media and it is not known where all of these media are distributed along the line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , measurements of the rm can be used to infer the presence of magnetic fields and ionised gas somewhere along the line of sight between an observer and a source .",
    "it has previously been suggested that there is a correlation between metal - line absorption and the rm of distant polarized sources @xcite .",
    "more recent studies have extended these previous works by finding a correlation between the magnitude of the rm and the number of strong mgii absorbing systems along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this has been used to suggest that these intervening systems are magnetized , and that the magnetic fields in these intervening normal galaxies are of much higher strength than is typically expected in this earlier epoch of the universe .",
    "this adds an extra challenge to our understanding of cosmic magnetism , as it implies the faraday rotation towards a background quasar consists of a galactic , intrinsic , and also an additional _ intervening _ contribution .",
    "@xcite inferred a population of intervening magnetized sources from rms measured at relatively high radio frequencies , i.e.  at @xmath135  ghz , using a sample of 71 optical quasar spectra .",
    "the correlation claimed between the presence of mgii absorption lines and increased magnitude of rm is relatively weak , with a signal equivalent to a @xmath14 detection when comparing @xmath15=0 and @xmath15>0 , where @xmath15 is the number of mgii absorbers along a line of sight , and a @xmath16 detection between @xmath15=0 and @xmath15=2 , albeit with only five sources with @xmath15=2 . this has been suggested as evidence that the intervening systems must increase the rm along the line of sight .",
    "conversely , when using rms measured at lower frequencies , i.e.  at 1.4  ghz , the correlation between rm and the presence of mgii absorbers is consistent with no signal @xcite , or with a weakly positive result at the @xmath17 level @xcite .",
    "this observed dichotomy between results at 1.4  ghz and 5  ghz has been used to suggest that the intervenors provide ` partial coverage ' , and obscure only a fraction of the background radio source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under such circumstances",
    ", @xcite suggests that mgii absorbers provide partial coverage of the background source with an inhomogeneous faraday screen , which could perhaps depolarize the high rm component at low radio frequencies  thereby giving rise to an observed ` faraday complexity ' , i.e.  a system with a non - linear relationship between polarization angle and squared wavelength so that rm@xmath18rm(@xmath8 ) .",
    "as the sight lines with intervening systems that exhibit faraday complexity appear associated with low fractional polarization at low frequency @xcite , this has been interpreted as evidence of depolarization due to partial coverage .",
    "in addition , the suggested presence of partial coverage has also been inferred from polarized spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the apparent frequency - dependence of the effect could alternatively be a result of observational selection effects : at high and low radio frequencies we select different source populations , with different morphology and position in relation to the optical counterparts .",
    "such relationships could also be caused by a number of confounding variables that require interpretation of their effect on the data .",
    "one possible proxy for overcoming these selection effects is the total intensity spectral index , @xmath19 , defined such that @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to take these selection effects and confounding variables into account .",
    "we re - examine the relationship between mgii absorption and rm from first principles , to determine whether this relationship extends to low observational frequencies .",
    "the consequences of such a relationship are important , as the emergence of magnetic fields in normal galaxies plays a strong role in star - formation in galaxy discs , drives the structure of the interstellar medium , influences other astrophysical processes that drive galaxy evolution , has implications for the cosmological growth of magnetic fields , and constrains dynamo mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "investigating such relationships may also provide the first conclusive empirical discriminant between theories of magnetic field amplification and structure .",
    "the standard @xmath19@xmath21 dynamo predicts that a small seed field is amplified by the combined action of differential rotation and turbulence on a large - scale in a galactic disk .",
    "these seed fields could be either primordial or have been generated by supernovae and amplified by dynamo action .",
    "primordial fields could also be amplified in the process of the collapse of protogalaxies , or by dynamo action in oblique shocks as a protogalaxy collapses .",
    "observational constraints on these competing models are currently lacking ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we present our observational data in section  [ data ] , where we detail and justify how we created our sample and its properties .",
    "we detail the quantitative analysis of our main sample in section  [ analysis ] , with the analysis of our subsamples being presented in section  [ subsamples ] .",
    "we discuss our results and the effect of confounding variables in section  [ discussion ] , while a summary of the physical implications of our findings are presented in section  [ conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ theory ] , we argue that current mathematical models of partial coverage are incompatible with observational evidence .",
    "we refer to ` polarization ' on multiple occasions , in all cases we are referring to linear radio polarization ",
    "both circular and optical polarization are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "all derived uncertainties are calculated using standard error propagation . unless otherwise specified , all quantities are as measured in the observed - frame .",
    "we use the broadband radio polarization catalog of @xcite as our primary data source .",
    "this catalog accumulates and cross - matches data from throughout the literature over the last 50 years , taking resolution effects into account through the cross - matching criteria , and incorporating a significant number of major radio surveys including the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) , at20 g , b3-vla , wenss , north6 cm , gb6 , and texas .",
    "the @xcite catalog expands upon the nvss rm catalog at 1.4  ghz @xcite , providing total intensity spectral indices , @xmath19 , for 25,649 sources , and polarization spectral indices , @xmath22 , for 1,171 sources .",

    "note that @xmath22 is defined in the opposite sense to the total intensity spectral index , @xmath19 , which is defined as @xmath20 and is the exponent of observing frequency rather than wavelength . ] furthermore , the catalog contains 951 polarized seds that are defined between 0.4  ghz to 100  ghz , with up to 56 independent polarization measurements per source .",
    "@xcite use model fitting and an automated classification algorithm based on the bayesian information criterion to distinguish between different models for faraday depolarization and to constrain total intensity radio spectral indices and curvature . in attempting to fit physical models of depolarization to the data",
    ", the assumption is made that the polarization fraction , @xmath24 , is intrinsically a meaningful quantity that is related to the degree of magnetic field ordering in the source .",
    "@xcite fit to the polarization angle as a function of wavelength , obtaining broadband rm measurements , and also include spectroscopic redshifts for 4,003 linearly polarized radio sources that were identified by @xcite using various resources including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we cross - match the data from @xcite with the catalog of @xcite , which presents a sample of 84,534 quasars with a total of 35,752 non - intrinsic mgii absorption systems along their lines of sight , as derived from sdss spectra . since the catalog of rm versus redshift @xcite and the catalog of mgii absorption @xcite",
    "are both based on data from the sdss , one way to combine the catalogs would be to use an arbitrarily small cross - matching radius .",
    "however , @xcite do not necessarily nominate the nearest sdss source , as seen in projection on the sky , as the most likely matched candidate .",
    "the catalog instead provides a ` selected redshift ' which is determined from the inclusion of other redshift catalogs and which takes into account the morphology of , for example , double - lobed radio sources . to combine the @xcite data with the @xcite catalog , we therefore use the redshift of the background quasar , @xmath25 , in the cross - matching criteria .",
    "cross - matching was carried out relative to the radio source positions provided by @xcite , each of which has an associated rm measurement at 1.4  ghz . for a match to be accepted ,",
    "it must have been listed in the @xcite catalog , be within an astrometric radius of @xmath26 of the nvss source position , and have a maximum redshift difference between the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite of @xmath27 .",
    "this additional criterion helps to eliminate false cross - matches by ensuring consistent redshifts throughout both datasets .",
    "note that the @xmath26 astrometric radius is only used to find associated radio emission , and it is the quasar redshift that is used to minimize the number of false matches .",
    "the cross - matching of optical and radio data , including complex morphological effects , has already been done rigorously by @xcite .",
    "a typical model of an extragalactic radio source includes at least two components : ( i ) the core - region surrounding the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) itself , and ( ii ) the radio lobes and/or jets . where an extragalactic radio source is also detected at optical wavelengths , the bright optical counterpart is generally associated with the core .",
    "since mgii absorption systems are optically identified , they only provide information on the presence of intervenors towards the core .",
    "the presence of an mgii absorber therefore provides no constraints on the presence of absorption towards the radio lobes or jets .",
    "furthermore , at high frequencies we tend to select the flat - spectrum cores of radio sources , while at low frequencies we tend to select the steep - spectrum lobes and jets .",
    "as the lobes are physically offset from the cores , it is therefore possible that such an effect is ` diluting ' the measured relationship between rm and the number of mgii absorbers , when measured at low frequencies .",
    "analysing the polarized fraction and rm of an agn at radio wavelengths within a finite resolution element will therefore potentially include contaminating polarized emission from the radio lobes and/or jets .",
    "previous studies have not had the data available to investigate the extent of these contaminating effects .",
    "a sample that attempts to ensure that the core is probed at both radio and optical wavelengths will therefore assist in minimizing observational biases .",
    "note that we wish to probe the same emitting region within the source at both optical and radio wavelengths , and not just as seen in projection in the plane of the sky .",
    "this is important for three reasons : ( i ) probing the same emitting region ensures that we are probing very similar lines of sight , ( ii ) this ensures that we make no assumptions with respect to the physical size of an intervening system , and ( iii ) it is the only way to guarantee we are not affected by projection effects  it is possible we could observe the core region at optical wavelengths , and meanwhile probe a lobe / jet at radio wavelengths as seen in projection on the sky .",
    "point ( iii ) highlights that the requirement is not just for similar lines of sight , but for similar emitting regions .",
    "one can not easily attempt to confirm that the emitting regions are coincident for an unresolved radio source using positional offsets only , i.e.  offsets in the plane of the sky , as very unresolved sources would incorrectly appear to emit from the same region at both optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "this is potentially important at the @xmath28 resolution of the nvss as used here .",
    "it is also not possible to explore projection effects using positional offsets of data with mismatched resolution  for example , a steep - spectrum radio lobe can appear to be coaligned with an optical core , despite both physical features not emanating from the same line of sight .",
    "we therefore highlight that without the introduction of either multiple simplifying assumptions or very long baseline interferometric data , the same physical line of sight can not be trivially probed using merely the alignment of radio and optical counterparts .",
    "we therefore suggest an improved measure of the same emitting region , and by extension the same physical line of sight .",
    "this can be provided by the total intensity spectral index , @xmath19 .",
    "a prototypical model of an extragalactic radio source is one that consists of at least two emitting regions : ( i ) a flat - spectrum core ( @xmath29 ) , and ( ii ) steep - spectrum jets / lobes ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the spectral index therefore serves as a powerful discriminator of the physical emitting region that is largely independent of both resolution and projection effects .",
    "although unresolved radio sources can contain emission from both the core region and the jets / lobes , the spectral index allows us to determine from which physical region the emission dominates .",
    "consequently , flat - spectrum sources can be used as a proxy for the optical and radio counterparts being aligned ( i.e.  a core - dominated source ) , and steep - spectrum sources for those not aligned ( i.e.  a lobe - dominated source ) .",
    "this provides a reliable divider between different physical emitting regions and by extension of different lines of sight , while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of selecting regions that are merely aligned through projection or resolution effects .",
    "it is likely that the sources would need to be angularly resolved in order to completely eliminate such projection effects , although we believe this is only a very infrequent effect in our sample .",
    "the cross - matching process provides an initial sample in which each source has a measurement of the number of mgii absorbing systems along the line of sight , the redshifts of the background quasar and of the intervening systems , and also a polarized fraction and an rm measurement at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "we also have supplementary data on the equivalent width of each absorbing system .",
    "all of the mgii absorption lines are non - intrinsic ( aka intervening ) @xcite , and are blue - shifted from their background quasar by at least @xmath31 .    to improve the quality of our sample , we exclude sources that are best modeled by a curved spectrum in total intensity @xcite , keeping only sources that were best fit by a conventional power law . to avoid poor - quality total intensity spectral indices in our sample , we exclude sources with a reduced-@xmath32 . as the data used to construct the seds",
    "were taken at different epochs , more variable sources may tend to have an increased reduced-@xmath33  we are therefore likely selecting the least variable sources , in addition to those with low measurement errors . in order to minimize the effects of the galactic foreground",
    ", we discard sources at galactic latitudes @xmath34 .",
    "a full discussion of foreground effects is provided in section  [ foreground ] .",
    "we are also primarily concerned with the _ strong _ absorbing systems . based upon statistical arguments , it historically had been suggested that very small rest - frame equivalent width mgii absorption did not exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to high signal  to  noise and high - resolution spectroscopy , the detection thresholds eventually dropped below the previous sensitivity levels of @xmath35  @xmath36 so that this could be tested through observation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the conventional divider between strong and weak mgii absorption is therefore assumed throughout the literature , by definition , to be at a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath35  @xmath36 ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore , in this paper , consider the strong absorbers to be those with an equivalent width @xmath37   .",
    "most contemporary studies have found that both strong and weak mgii absorbers are associated with different clouds of material : strong absorbers are typically associated with outflows from star - forming normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas weak absorbers may be related to the outskirts of normal galaxies , dwarf galaxies , material stripped through tidal interactions , and low surface - brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our initial sample contained both strong and weak absorbers , although it was dominated by strong absorbers .",
    "we calculate the mean rest - equivalent width , @xmath38 , using the data of @xcite .",
    "absorbing systems with @xmath39    ( @xmath40 ) were excluded from the rest of our analysis .",
    "this final sample contains 599 sources .",
    "we shall refer to this as the ` main sample ' . from @xcite",
    ", we also have a measurement of the total intensity spectral index , @xmath19 , for 548 of these sources .",
    "the main sample contains 398 sources without mgii absorption and 201 sources with strong non - intrinsic mgii absorption . of the absorbing lines of sight ,",
    "152 contain a single mgii absorber , 38 contain two absorbers , 10 contain three absorbers , 0 contain four absorbers , and 1 contains five absorbers .",
    "the size of our sample is an improvement of almost an order of magnitude upon that of @xcite , which contained measurements of mgii absorption and rm for 71 quasar spectra , and is also 10% larger than the sample of @xcite , which contained 539 measurements of quasar spectra and rm but did not have spectral index information available .",
    "our sample is further assisted by the high - reliability of the mgii data , which have both a purity and a completeness of @xmath41% @xcite .    using the spectral indices",
    ", we further split the sources into two subsamples : ` flat - spectrum ' ( @xmath42 ) and ` steep - spectrum ' ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the gap in spectral index from @xmath44 serves to avoid cross - contamination between the two samples .",

    "our steep - spectrum subsample contains 154 sources with no absorber , 62 with one absorber , and 16 with more than one absorber .",
    "estimates of many other parameters are available in the catalog of @xcite , but are in a regime of small sample statistics after cross - matching with the mgii catalog .",
    "we therefore exclude these other variables from our analysis , and consider only the rms and polarized fractions at 1.4  ghz , and the depolarization spectral indices .",

    "such evidence suggests that the spectral index is important for discriminating between core- and lobe - dominated sources , and is a reasonable proxy for matching lines of sight at different wavelengths .",
    "as the intervening mgii absorbers are identified towards quasar cores at optical wavelengths , the intervenors can only be said to be obscuring the core at radio wavelengths .",

    "we therefore form three conclusions from fig .  [ ecdfs_cores_lobes ] :    the observed difference in rm between flat - spectrum sources with and without absorption arises due to intervening magnetized plasma in the absorbing systems  the flat - spectrum of the source ensures that we probe the same line of sight towards the background quasar independently of projection and resolution effects ,    there is no difference in rm between steep - spectrum sources with and without absorption as we are usually probing different lines of sight at optical and radio wavelengths  this effect is particularly important at longer radio wavelengths where the steep - spectrum lobes / jets tend to dominate the radio emission ,    any difference detected between the flat- and steep - spectrum sources without absorbers could be due to two effects .",

    "secondly , the very high rm components of the core may have depolarized at 1.4  ghz , so that only lower rm components are still observable .    to provide a quantitative estimate of the excess rm associated with intervening galaxies , we assume that the correlation between mgii absorption and rm for flat - spectrum sources has an entirely physical origin .",

    "our result suggests that different source - components , and consequently different lines of sight , result in the mgii absorption versus rm signal being diluted at 1.4  ghz unless core- and lobe - type sources are considered separately .",
    "this divide suggests that either the typical intervenor must be small in angular size relative to the size of the background galaxy , that there is a sharp boundary to the magnetoionic medium in the intervenor , or that the mgii absorbing gas is highly localised within a host galaxy . however , even when separating the sample based on total intensity spectral index , we find no difference in the depolarization of either flat- or steep - sources that have intervening absorption ( see section  [ depol_section ] ) .",

    "we now explore alternate hypotheses that may explain our finding that our data are consistent with flat - spectrum sources with intervening absorbers having increased rm .",

    "the physics of such models and their applicability to our data , particularly when adding additional intervening contributions to the rm that are each located at different redshifts , is beyond the scope of this paper . ]    in such cases , the distribution in @xmath25 of the sample will determine the magnitude of the spurious correlation , i.e.  a small range or a uniform distribution in @xmath25 yields a weak correlation , while conversely a wide range or a highly non - uniform distribution in @xmath25 yields a strong correlation . to test this , one would ideally resample the data by redshift - binning the flat- and steep - spectrum sources into equal bins , thereby providing a uniform distribution as a function of redshift .",
    "we are unable to do this and form firm conclusions as we increasingly fall into the realm of small - sample statistics .",
    "however , we are still able to discard such a possibility , and note that a connection between rm and the number of mgii absorbers ( as in fig .  [ ecdfs_cores_lobes ] )",
    "is not detected for the steep - spectrum sources , despite both the flat- and steep - spectrum sources showing a similar relation between the number of absorbers as a function of @xmath25 ( as in fig .",

    "yields a @xmath47-value of 7.6% for zero absorbers , 81% for one absorber , and 99% for two or more absorbers .",
    "such low significance levels are most consistent with the null hypothesis being true , i.e.  there is no quantitative difference between the redshift distributions of the flat- and steep - spectrum sources .",
    "this suggests a longer line of sight towards a source is not in itself responsible for an increase in rm within our data , and that while sources with more absorbers in our sample are located at higher redshifts , this is equally true for both the flat- and steep - spectrum sources .",
    "a spurious correlation that arises due to the sources with absorbers being located further away is therefore not consistent with the observed difference between flat- and steep - spectrum sources .    to explain the observed difference between flat- and steep - spectrum sources , given the distribution of our sample with redshift , therefore requires another hypothesis .",
    "consider if the flat - spectrum sources were evolving as a function of @xmath25 , while the steep - spectrum sources were not evolving .",
    "in such a scenario , we propose that some mechanism causes flat - spectrum sources to have a higher observed - frame rm at higher redshift .",
    "we now discuss the possibilities that could cause the observed - frame rm to appear to be scaling as a function of @xmath25 in flat - spectrum sources , while not in steep - spectrum sources .",
    "these explanations broadly fall into two categories : ( i ) systematic observational effects , and ( ii ) astrophysical source evolution .",

    "the observed correlation between the number of mgii absorbers and rm for flat - spectrum sources in our sample , therefore implies a _ smaller _ rm along the line of sight towards the _ fainter _ flat - spectrum sources , or conversely a _",
    "larger _ rm towards the _ brighter _ flat - spectrum sources .",
    "overall , this requires some mechanism that causes the measured rm at fixed - frequency towards flat - spectrum sources to tend to be smaller for low luminosity sources ; these sources then drop below the detection threshold at high @xmath25 and we perceive a net increasing rm .",
    "this would be consistent with relativistic beaming models that state that compact , flat - spectrum radio sources are seen at small viewing angles , with weaker cores being seen at progressively larger viewing angles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that : ( a ) those weaker cores at larger angles are poorly sampled at high @xmath25 within a flux - density limited survey ( leading to a luminosity effect ) , and ( b ) the line of sight through host galaxies with large viewing angles could possibly be reduced , giving rise to lower values of rm for these cores at larger angles ( depending on the distribution of electrons and magnetic field near to the central engine ) .",
    "note that such a scenario need not affect the rm observed towards steep - spectrum sources .",

    "this is hard to reconcile with the requirement of depolarization in this proposed alternative hypothesis .",
    "the proposed toy model also contradicts the observation that weak mgii absorbers are not correlated with rm along the line of sight @xcite , as this further suggests that there can not be an additional confounding variable , i.e.  no evolution of quasar magnetic fields with @xmath25 .",
    "one could counter that the nature of weak mgii absorbing systems is still poorly understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that previous studies have not separated sources based on the spectral index .",
    "regardless , the proposed toy model would still require a strong evolution of the observed - frame rm as a function of @xmath25 for flat - spectrum sources .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ ecdfs_rmversusz ] , there is no observed rm evolution in the flat - spectrum sources of our sample . there is only one remaining possibility : that our data are consistent with intervening systems , as traced by mgii absorption , containing regular magnetic fields that increase faraday rotation along the lines of sight towards distant background quasars .",
    "we have investigated the current theoretical and observational understanding of faraday effects originating along the line of sight due to intervening heavy - metal absorbing systems .",
    "we have divided a sample of flat- and steep - spectrum radio sources into subsamples both with and without mgii absorption along the line of sight .",
    "we have been able to use these samples as a proxy for core- ( flat - spectrum ) or lobe- ( steep - spectrum ) dominated sources . this has allowed us to study the same sight line at both optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "we find that the core - dominated sample has a larger |rm| when intervening mgii absorbers are present , with a probability of 0.044% of the increase in |rm| being this large or greater if the data were drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "conversely to previous studies , which have found no association between mgii absorption and faraday rotation at 1.4  ghz , we instead find evidence of an association that is stronger than that which has been presented before at any other observing frequency .",
    "we have considered various alternative effects , including varying luminosity in our essentially flux - limited sample , evolution of magnetic fields with redshift , and other more elaborate possibilities that may cause a spurious correlation .",
    "we find that none of them are fully consistent with both our data and our theoretical understanding of cosmic magnetism .",
    "the simplest way to explain our observations while remaining consistent with previous observational findings is to require the rm to be increased by additional magnetic fields , or ionised gas , that are associated with intervening mgii absorbing systems along the line of sight .",
    "if we assume that the correlation between mgii absorption and rm has an origin entirely due to intervening galaxies , then as a quantitative estimate , our data suggest that a typical absorber provides an additional rm contribution of @xmath68  rad  m@xmath62 in the observing frame . at the median redshift of our sample ,",
    "@xmath90 , this implies an rm contribution of @xmath71  rad  m@xmath62 from a typical intervening cloud of magnetized plasma in the source rest - frame .",
    "consequently our data are consistent with , and provide the strongest statistical indication to date for , the idea that coherent magnetic fields of substantial strength ( @xmath2  @xmath3 g ) are present in what are presumed to be normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility that faraday rotation along the line of sight to a typical quasar could be enhanced by an otherwise essentially invisible population of intervening normal galaxies is an intriguing one .",
    "the physical implications of this have been rigorously explored elsewhere , providing constraints for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , magnetic field generation , and dynamo mechanisms @xcite .",
    "our data complement previous studies by showing that connections between rm and mgii absorption are still detectable at lower radio frequencies , and that the contribution from intervening systems to the overall faraday rotation along the line of sight must be weak relative to that from the background quasars .",
    "it is also indicates the importance of probing similar lines of sight at optical and radio wavelengths , suggesting that projection effects between cores and lobes have been important contributors to previous studies .",
    "however , while our method of using the total intensity spectral index to identify the same line of sight at different wavelengths is a significant primary step , we do not currently have the data available to definitively confirm that the polarized emission is coincident with the total intensity emission . investigating such potential systematics",
    "would likely require full reprocessing of surveys such as the nvss , or the arrival of next generation surveys such as the polarization sky survey of the universe s magnetism ( possum ) that will be carried out with the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) @xcite .",
    "the significance of the correlation between intervening absorption lines and rm is currently only at a level equivalent to a @xmath91 event from a normally distributed process , although we note that we have been unable to calculate either a confidence interval , or the probability of the hypothesis . in future studies",
    ", a full bayesian framework would be useful to further analyse our statistical detection .",
    "our data show that connections between intervening systems and faraday rotation are difficult to detect , due to the multiple effects that may alter the rm at cosmological distances .",
    "placing the interaction on an even firmer statistical footing will require multiple quantities : larger samples of strong mgii absorbers , higher angular resolution radio data , unambiguous rms , broadband spectral indices , and improved estimates of the galactic foreground .",
    "future observations with facilities such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) will therefore be important in confirming these results with much greater statistical significance , and for determining the physical properties of the intervening systems themselves , such as improved estimates of the typical magnetic field strength , the physical size , and any redshift dependence of the magnetic field properties .",
    "the combination of existing radio morphology classifications @xcite , other radio surveys such as first @xcite , and measurements of the spectral index ( see section  [ combowavelengths ] ) , will also form the foundation of a useful future study .",
    "the intervenors themselves could also have implications for an ska ` rm - grid ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as rm measurements from core - dominated sources may have a more complex relation to the magnetic field of the galactic foreground .",
    "this would impede attempts to calculate a residual rotation measure ( see section  [ foreground ] ) using multiple lines of sight within some defined region of sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "broadband measurements of core - dominated sources , combined with reconstructions of the galactic foreground using simulated data , will be required to investigate such possibilities .",
    "overall , the new evidence presented here rules out models of partial coverage by inhomogeneous faraday screens ( see section  [ introduction ] ) ; the justification for such models has been based on the lack of connection between the number of mgii absorbers and the rm at 1.4  ghz .",
    "taken together with the connection between radio depolarization and total intensity spectral index @xcite , our results serve as a reminder of the importance of opacity effects on radio polarization measurements . in combination",
    ", these results suggest that depolarization is predominantly occurring in the local environment of the background agn , while the rm is significantly contributed to by the intervening normal galaxy population .",
    "the consequences are important for all future and upcoming radio polarimetric studies .",

    "the potential presence of partial coverage has previously been inferred from polarized spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . for some sources ,",
    "the polarized seds have been described by an equation of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the rm dispersion of the faraday screen within a single beam , @xmath8 is the observing wavelength , @xmath24 is the fractional polarization , and @xmath94 is the fractional polarization at infinite frequency .",
    "such external faraday depolarization was initially proposed by @xcite  a ` burn law ' . however , while in some sources the polarized fraction can behave similarly to equation  [ burnbabyburn ] at progressively shorter wavelengths , it remains unexpectedly constant out to longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these seds that follow a ` rossetti  mantovani law ' have been explained by assuming that only a fraction of the source is covered by an inhomogeneous faraday screen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in an effort to derive @xmath93 for these sources , @xcite made an empirical modification to the burn law so that @xmath95 \\ , , \\label{partialcoverage}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is interpreted as the covered ( depolarizing ) fraction of the source , with the uncovered fraction @xmath97 retaining a constant polarized fraction , @xmath98 , out to arbitrarily long wavelengths .",
    "this model has been found to be more successful than the burn law in reproducing the sed of some sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the existence of such partial coverage sed models and the mgii absorption line studies ( see section  [ introduction ] ) both imply partial coverage , this has been taken together to imply that there must be a link between partial coverage seds and mgii absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  with the inference that intervening mgii host galaxies may be responsible for the partial coverage .",
    "nevertheless , while some polarized seds show a similar run in the polarized fraction as a function of wavelength as that predicted by equation  [ partialcoverage ] , due to sample limitations there is currently no direct evidence available in the literature to connect these same sources to the presence of mgii absorption lines .",
    "attempts to justify partial coverage models have previously been made using equation [ partialcoverage ] , as this explains the functional form of some polarized seds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite found that faraday complexity appears to be more commonly observed in weakly polarized sources , which led to the proposal of a toy model that suggests this is related to enhanced depolarization of different source components due to partial coverage .",
    "however , flat - spectrum sources are also known to be intrinsically more weakly polarized than their steep - spectrum counterparts .",
    "it is therefore plausible that such effects could be caused by , for example , epoch - dependent variability between observations , or an increased presence of faraday complexity in the seds of flat - spectrum sources .",
    "such possibilities provide a more simple alternative to invoking a partial coverage model .",
    "irrespective of the presence of an intervenor , the majority of radio sources are known to undergo depolarization at increasing radio wavelengths due to coverage by an inhomogeneous ` faraday screen ' , i.e.  a magnetoionic region that is devoid of relativistic particles and that exists somewhere along the line of sight between the observer and the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we assume that these faraday screens are always inhomogeneous and contain a turbulent or systematically varying regular magnetic field , such that the screen causes depolarization , and not just faraday rotation .",
    "although the location of these screens along the line of sight can not be trivially determined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more recent data suggests that the most significant predictor of the depolarization properties is the total intensity spectral index @xcite  suggesting that the faraday screens are located within the local source environment and that radio opacity effects are important for polarization studies .",
    "following the conventional partial coverage model , consider the case where an intervening galaxy is known to be present and is believed to be partially covering the background quasar .",
    "the model of equation  [ partialcoverage ] makes the critical assumption that while a fraction of the source is partially covered by an inhomogeneous faraday screen from an intervenor , the other fraction is completely uncovered  with no covering depolarizing screen whatsoever .",
    "how this uncovered portion of the source altogether escapes the effects of faraday screens , and remains depolarization - free , is not explained . as a typical radio source without an associated intervenor",
    "is known to be covered by a depolarizing screen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similarly , portions of a source without an intervening object should also have a similar screen .",
    "one could argue that the screen across the uncovered portion of the source is a non - turbulent faraday screen , that does not depolarize and which only adds additional faraday rotation , although there are no suitable candidates for such a physical mechanism in this subset of sources .",
    "analogously , equation  [ partialcoverage ] states that when the covering fraction tends to zero , the polarized fraction will remain constant at all wavelengths .",
    "such a theory is incompatible with the observational evidence , which shows that there is no realistic expectation of detectable polarization at arbitrarily long wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that all other depolarization models that are typically available in the literature , such as the burn law , have all been derived from physical principles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to be physically justified , any partial coverage model must also allow for depolarization in the uncovered fraction of the source , or explain how the uncovered fraction can become immune to the effects of the inhomogeneous faraday screens that surround a typical radio source .",
    "we therefore extend the partial coverage model to include the effect of an inhomogeneous faraday screen across the uncovered fraction of a source , such that @xmath99 \\right ) } + \\left ( 1-f_{\\text{c } } \\right ) \\exp{\\left ( -2\\sigma_{\\text{norm}}^2\\lambda^4 \\right ) } \\right ] \\ , , \\label{partialcoverage2}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the rm dispersion in the absence of an intervenor ( whether this dispersion originates locally to the source , in the galaxy , or elsewhere ) , and @xmath101 is the screen provided by the intervenor and which is allowed to partially cover a fraction , @xmath96 , of the background emitting region , i.e.  a quasar or radio galaxy .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that the intervening and normal screens are independent and uncorrelated , such that the combined rm dispersion of the two overlapping screens is given by @xmath102 .",
    "we also assume that the background emitting region is optically - thin and that opacity effects are negligible .",
    "the functional form of the partial coverage model in equation  [ partialcoverage2 ] is advantageous to previous partial coverage models in that it is physically consistent , and when either @xmath103 or @xmath104  rad  m@xmath62 we retrieve a conventional burn law .",
    "the original partial coverage model in equation  [ partialcoverage ] is now only a special case , albeit a non - physical one , when @xmath105  rad  m@xmath62 .",
    "this extended partial coverage model has significant implications for our understanding of partial coverage .",
    "it can only recreate the observed constant portion of a polarized sed as a special case , when the normal depolarizing screen that covers a fraction @xmath106 of the source is exactly equal to zero , i.e.  @xmath105  rad  m@xmath62 . the polarized seds that can occur in this depolarization model",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ mgii_simulation ] .",
    "the seds show considerable variation depending on the ratio of @xmath107 , and exceptionally high - quality observational data would be required to distinguish between these various scenarios .",
    "importantly , for @xmath108 and low ratios of @xmath107 , the functional form is indistinguishable from the case where @xmath103 , i.e.  a burn law .",
    "furthermore , even for arbitrarily high ratios of @xmath107 , the polarized sed will not exhibit the constant polarized tail that is the crucial foundation for a ` partial coverage ' model .",
    "consequently , while derivation of @xmath93 using equation  [ partialcoverage ] may suitably mathematically parameterize the rate of decay of polarization as a function of @xmath8 , it is unlikely that @xmath93 describes the rm dispersion of a physical faraday screen .",

    "we therefore also propose an alternative model to explain their origin .",
    "it has previously been found that flat - spectrum radio sources typically maintain a relatively constant polarized fraction as a function of @xmath8 , which has been explained as a consequence of multiple optically - thick emission regions in the quasar core @xcite  such sources can maintain an approximately constant polarized fraction as a function of wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an extension of this , the polarized sed of an unresolved , compact source may be the superposition of two components : ( i ) a strongly polarized and strongly depolarizing optically - thin jets / lobes ( with @xmath30 ) , and ( ii ) a weakly polarized and weakly depolarizing optically - thick core ( with @xmath112 ) .",
    "such an sed would have a functional form similar to that presented in the original partial coverage model shown in equation  [ partialcoverage ] , as it would be dominated by the depolarizing jets / lobes at high frequencies and the weakly depolarizing core at low frequencies .",
    "note that this is the inverse of the typical situation in total intensity , where the steep - spectrum jets / lobes dominate the emission at low frequencies .",
    "such a model is falsifiable , as in all cases the approximately constant polarized tail that extends to low frequencies must have a polarized fraction @xmath113% , which is the maximum degree of polarization for an optically - thick region ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is consistent with the catalog of @xcite , which finds a maximum value for the polarized tail of 5.1% from their sample of sources that are classified using a partial coverage sed .",
    "however , if correct , this leads to complications for the typical physical understanding of a polarized fraction ( which is the ratio of the polarized and total intensity components ) . in unresolved sources with an sed of ` partial coverage '",
    "form , our measurements are biased towards the brightest _ polarized _ intensity within the resolution element seen in projection on the sky .",
    "meanwhile , the brightest _ total _ intensity for the same source may not correspond to the same emitting region . as the peak polarized and total intensity both sample different regions of the source , this leads to the possibility that a polarized fraction , @xmath24 , may not be at all related to the degree of magnetic field ordering in these unresolved sources .",
    "consequently , at a given frequency a source may be core - dominated in stokes @xmath114 and lobe - dominated in @xmath115 , or vice - versa .",
    "high resolution and broadband observations of lines of sight with known intervening objects will be necessary to test our predictions .",
    "we therefore highlight how the partial coverage model of equation  [ partialcoverage ] is both incompatible with observational evidence , and is also empirical rather than physical ",
    "unlike other depolarization laws ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have adjusted this mathematical model so that it is physically accurate , thereby including the more realistic case where a faraday screen other than the one provided by the intervenor is also present . in these cases ,",
    "depolarization from partial coverage can be indistinguishable from a burn law ( see equation  [ burnbabyburn ] ) at all wavelengths , and never has a constant polarized tail even for extreme ratios of @xmath107 .",

    "<S> strong singly - ionized magnesium ( mgii ) absorption lines in quasar spectra typically serve as a proxy for intervening galaxies along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have found a correlation between the number of these mgii absorbers and the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) at @xmath0  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we cross - match a sample of 35,752 optically - identified non - intrinsic mgii absorption systems with 25,649 polarized background radio sources for which we have measurements of both the spectral index and rm at 1.4  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we use the spectral index to split the resulting sample of 599 sources into flat - spectrum and steep - spectrum subsamples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our flat - spectrum sample shows significant ( @xmath1 ) evidence for a correlation between mgii absorption and rm at 1.4  ghz , while our steep - spectrum sample shows no such correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that such an effect can not be explained by either luminosity or other observational effects , by evolution in another confounding variable , by wavelength - dependent polarization structure in an active galactic nucleus , by the galactic foreground , by cosmological expansion , or by partial coverage models . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our data are most consistent with intervenors directly contributing to the faraday rotation along the line of sight , and that the intervening systems must therefore have coherent magnetic fields of substantial strength ( @xmath2  @xmath3 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the weak nature of the correlation will require future high - resolution and broadband radio observations in order to place it on a much firmer statistical footing . </S>"
