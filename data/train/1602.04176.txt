    "a great deal of effort has been devoted to gaining a better understanding of the optical and electron transport properties of one - component plasmas , which may be treated as two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) or three - dimensional electron gases ( 3deg ) [ ] . this is due in part to 2deg structures being used in models of semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "in contrast to its three - dimensional counterpart , the 2deg is by far more challenging because of the quantum effects arising from the confinement . in studying static properties , both integral equation theory and monte carlo simulations",
    "have been developed . the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation integral equation theory has been proved to be quite accurate compared to simulations based on phenomenological models @xcite , but it requires more elaborate numerical calculations due to the time consuming frankel transform , i.e. , the two - dimensional fourier transform .",
    "moreover , in the absence of a magnetic field , dynamical properties have been investigated through molecular dynamics ( md ) and kubo - greenwood short time expansions .",
    "good agreement between these two approaches has been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "fabrication of high mobility 2degs is desirable in the semiconductor industry . in these structures ,",
    "electrons are confined in a layer between two carefully chosen semiconductor materials , such as gaas and algaas .",
    "these have found useful applications in semiconductor devices as a result of the unique electron transport properties at the interface . in low magnetic fields , applied perpendicular to the 2deg , unusual transport properties have been observed .",
    "apart from the well - known magnetoresistance oscillations which are due to commensurability effects in modulated 2d systems @xcite , a number of other low magnetic field anomalies appear at low temperature .",
    "for example , an observed anomaly is the positive magnetoresistance followed by a resistance drop at higher magnetic fields .",
    "such behavior was observed in metallic single crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully explained by the suppression of bragg reflections due to the lorentz force induced by the magnetic field , an effect known as magnetic breakdown @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of information is available for the electron transport and optical properties of the 2deg @xcite from both an experimental and theoretical point of view in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field could lead to novel behavior when the coulomb interaction can not be neglected @xcite . since an understanding of the physics of these systems in an applied magnetic field is helpful in device and metrological applications , there is much interest in their properties as a function of an applied field .",
    "for example , cunningham , et al .",
    "@xcite and wright , et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the plateaus of an acoustoelectric current in a narrow channel within a 2deg .",
    "their goal was to examine how the quantization of the acoustoelectric current was affected by magnetic field .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in the static , dynamic and thermodynamic properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems on helium and other substrates @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been much effort regarding how a substrate affects the collective modes of graphene @xcite .",
    "the 2d system we are concerned with is described by the coulomb potential which is the solution of poisson s equation , and is thus given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 we the distance between the two charges and @xmath3 is a scaling length which we choose as the length of the simulation cell .",
    "such a 2d one - component plasma ( ocp ) consists of identical point particles carrying a charge @xmath4 and interacting through the coulomb potential . to ensure charge neutrality ,",
    "the particles are immersed in a uniform positive background of charge .",
    "the thermodynamic state of the ocp is completely defined by the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the wigner - seitz disk and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "depending on the value of the coupling parameter , the system can be in the weakly correlated gaseous phase , strongly correlated liquid phase or in the crystalline wigner lattice state .",
    "there is a reasonably good understanding theoretically for the 2d electron system @xcite in a magnetic field making use of various types of approximations to deal with the many - body effects . in this paper",
    ", we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "our calculations are for a simplified model of electron layers such as those on a liquid helium surface .",
    "these systems have been generated by grimes and adams @xcite as well as other related experiments @xcite , in which the thickness of the layers of the electrons trapped on the surface of liquid he is much less than the inter - particle spacing @xmath6 , and we may thus treat the system as 2d . as a matter of fact , ma , girvin , and rajaraman @xcite have argued that even though the coulomb potential in quasi-2d systems is really @xmath8 , the effective potential is closer to @xmath9 for a layer with high dielectric constant surrounded by material with much smaller dielectric constant .",
    "the application of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field does not affect the classical nature of the system as long as the separation between landau levels satisfies @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the number density , @xmath12 has been varied over a wide range , i.e. , @xmath13 @xmath14 with a fermi energy of at most @xmath15 k , for which the system may be treated classically . we have carried out calculations over a range of coupling parameters for which there is a variation of the velocity auto - correlation function ( vaf ) with magnetic field at finite temperature .",
    "yamada and ferry @xcite have also investigated in detail the effect of magnetic field on some transport properties of 2d electron systems .",

    ", we have presented our results for the velocity autocorrelation function when there is no external magnetic field as well as in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath81 = @xmath82 and @xmath83 t and when the coupling constant @xmath0 = @xmath84 . in fig .   2 ,",
    "the magnetic field is chosen as @xmath85 t and several values of @xmath0 are used in our calculations .",
    "the results show a series of well defined oscillations , whose period is independent of the value of the dimensionless variable @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is characteristic for one component charged fluids and has also been observed in the three dimensional ocp @xcite and the classical 2d electron fluid .",
    "a comparison of the results shows that the frequency of the oscillation is independent of @xmath0 , but for a chosen time , @xmath86 is decreased as @xmath0 is increased . from fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that the magnetic field has no effect on the vaf for the smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that the effect is small if the value of @xmath0 is increased .",
    "furthermore , for large values of @xmath0 , the simulation results clearly show that in the presence of a magnetic field , the amplitudes of the oscillations are slightly changed , but as the time increases , after a few oscillations , their difference is negligible .    in fig .  3 , the root mean",
    "square ( rms ) displacement is plotted as a function of time for various values magnetic field @xmath81 for one coupling constant @xmath87 .",
    "the reason for plotting the rms is to clearly see the effect of magnetic field on the diffusion constant .",
    "the simulation results clearly show that the diffusion constant does not decrease monotonically with magnetic field .",
    "additionally , the rms displacements at each magnetic field are investigated in order to determine what is the effect due to magnetic field on the diffusion , the mean square displacement is given by :    @xmath88    here , @xmath89 is the position of the @xmath90 electron at time @xmath91 , @xmath92 the total number of electrons and @xmath93 stands for taking the time average of a quantity . in fig .  3 , we have presented results for the mean square displacement as a function of time for @xmath81=0.0 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 5.0 , 10.0 and 15.0 t. parabolic increments are applied for all magnetic fields . the slope of the linear increments decreases with increasing magnetic field . since one can obtain the diffusion constant from the slope of the curve",
    ", it is clear that for each value of @xmath81 , the diffusion constant will be different .",
    "therefore , magnetic field has some effect on the dynamics of the system . by making a comparison between three values of diffusion constant ,",
    "it is apparent that by increasing the strength of the magnetic field , the diffusion constant is changing about @xmath94 , we have run the system quite a long time , and the behavior will not change if one runs the computer program even longer .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "we have plotted the self correlation function for @xmath81= 1.0 for @xmath87 , which is defined as    @xmath95    the self correlation function is directly related to the diffusion constant it is instructive to investigate whether the self correlation function also show in its behavior , the effect of magnetic field .",
    "we have plotted the self correlation function for various wave vectors for each of three values of magnetic field .",
    "we will make a comparison in two ways .",
    "first we will plot the self correlation function for each wavevector for three values of magnetic field , then chosen value of magnetic field and various wavevectors .",
    "our calculations have shown that as the magnetic field is increased , the self correlation function is quickly reduced .",
    "this is consistant with the behavior of the mean square plots .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field has some clearly affects the dynamics of the single - particle motion of the system , as expected .",
    "we conclude fron our results for the pair correlation function that electrons have no preferred location .",
    "since electrons can not approach each other arbitrarily close due to the strong repulsive coulomb force , they will preferably move to neighboring unit cells and the applied magnetic field has no control in deternining which cells they would migrate into .",
    "this is the physical reason why magnetic field has virtually no effect on @xmath96 .",
    "it is well known that relaxation times to equilibruim always favor shorter paths which correspond to smaller diffusion constant .",
    "this is clear from our results in figs .   2 and 3 and are consistent with a semiclassical approach . in our clssical formalism",
    ", electrons may move easily between potential minima and will never get trapped in potential well giving rise to some diffusion constant . however , in the presence of magnetic field , the the diffusion constant may be zero due to trapping in a potential minimum .",
    "however the applied magnetic field does not only change the electron dynamics , but also its energy . in summary ,",
    "we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations for a coulomb system in an external magnetic field .",
    "the simulation result clearly show the static properties are unchanged due to magnetic field .",
    "in fig .  1 , we have presented our results for the velocity autocorrelation function when there is no external magnetic field as well as in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath97 and @xmath83 t and when the coupling constant @xmath87 . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the magnetic field is chosen as @xmath85 t and several values of @xmath0 are used in our calculations .",
    "the results show a series of well - defined oscillations , whose period is independent of the value of the dimensionless variable @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is a characteristic for one component charged fluids and has also been observed in the 3d ocp @xcite and the classical 2d electron fluid .",
    "a comparison of our results shows that the frequency of the oscillation is independent of @xmath0 , but for a chosen time , @xmath86 is decreased as @xmath0 is increased . from fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that the magnetic field has no effect on the vaf for the smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that the consequence of the applied magnetic field is not significant if the value of @xmath0 is increased .",
    "furthermore , for large values of @xmath0 , the simulation results clearly show that in the presence of a magnetic field , the amplitudes of the oscillations are slightly changed , but as the time increases , after a few oscillations , their difference is negligible .    figs .",
    "1 and 2 provide information about the dynamics of electrons over intervals of @xmath98 sec which can be comparable with the time between particle collisions .",
    "this means that we are probing features of dynamical behavior mainly determined by electron - electron interactions .            where @xmath102 .",
    "time reversal symmetry ensures that the odd terms in @xmath91 vanish .",
    "the short - time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function is related to the mean square acceleration ( or mean square force @xmath103 ) and provides information about the interaction between the particles as well as the lattice structure .    the second term in the taylor series expansion of the vaf arises from the combined effect due to the random force @xmath104 and the single - particle velocity ( see eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) ) .",
    "our findings confirm the rapid decay and oscillatory behavior in the vaf due to a single binary collision between the tagged particle and the other particles .",
    "also , the rapid oscillations indicate the strong coupling with the collective plasma excitations @xcite .",
    "the einstein frequency @xmath105 is for small oscillations in the potential well formed from the electron - electron interaction .",
    "since our calculations show that the vaf at intermediate times strongly depends on the electron coupling parameter @xmath0 , the electron - electron interaction clearly dominates over the lorentz force and at small times , their combined effect is given by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) ) .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the system becomes disordered due to the random force field .",
    "the correlations between the random force and the velocity which together produce the oscillations in the vaf become less important as @xmath0 is increased and after a long time .    the lorentz force on an electron",
    "causes it to move on a circular orbit between collisions . after each collision , which is assumed instantaneous",
    ", the electron again moves on a circular path with a different center but whose cyclotron radius is unchanged since the energy is conserved .",
    "consequently , the motion of the electron is equivalent to that in a randomly applied time - dependent magnetic field that changes the center of the cyclotron orbit .",
    "this explains why the vaf , a dynamical quantity , depends on the fixed external magnetic field .",
    "also , the mean force which is determined by correlations through the pair correlation function is affeted by the value chosen for @xmath0 .    in summary",
    ", we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations for the vaf of a 2d ocp system in an external magnetic field .",
    "we presented numerical results for a range of values of the coupling parameter @xmath0 and the magnetic field @xmath81 .",
    "our simulation results show how the period and amplitude of the oscillations of the vaf depend on these two variables ; the period of the oscillations does not depend on @xmath0 but their amplitude does .",
