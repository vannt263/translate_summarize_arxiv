    "the kinematics of collisionless plasmas has been studied in a wide variety of fields , such as in laboratory plasma physics , space physics , and astrophysics .",
    "evolution of collisionless plasmas and self - consistent electromagnetic fields is fully described by the vlasov - maxwell ( or vlasov - poisson ) equations .",
    "thanks to recent development in computational technology , self - consistent numerical simulations of collisionless plasmas have been successfully performed from the first - principle vlasov - maxwell system of equations .",
    "there are two numerical methods to solve the vlasov equation .",
    "the most popular one is the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method @xcite , which approximates the plasma by a finite number of macro - particles .",
    "their trajectories calculated from the equation of motion are continuous in space , whereas electromagnetic fields are calculated on grid points in space .",
    "the pic method has been used for a wide variety of plasma phenomena , because it gives satisfying results even with a relatively small number of particles . however , the pic method inherently has the large statistical noise due to an approximation of the distribution function by a finite number of particles .",
    "this noise only decreases in @xmath0 when the number of particles @xmath1 is increased , making it difficult to study such as particle acceleration and thermal transport processes , in which a small number of high energy particles play an important role .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "an alternative method free from the statistical noise has been used , in which the vlasov equation is directly discretized on grid points in phase space .",
    "the so - called vlasov simulation involves solving the advection equation in multidimensions ( up to six ) .",
    "however , it has been widely known that a numerical solution of the advection equation suffers from spurious oscillations and numerical diffusion .",
    "a highly accurate scheme is required to preserve characteristics of the vlasov equation ( i.e. , the liouville theorem ) as much as possible .",
    "in contrast to the pic simulation , no standard scheme for the vlasov simulation has been established thus far .",
    "@xcite proposed a splitting scheme , in which the electrostatic vlasov equation is split into two advection equations in one - dimensional configuration and velocity spaces , and then are alternately advanced .",
    "both equations reduce to a simple form of the linear advection equation .",
    "moreover , their splitting method is equivalent to the second - order symplectic integration so that the conservation of energy is very well .    following them , many authors have proposed high order advection schemes and applied them to the vlasov simulation .",
    "one of standard time integration methods for the advection equation is the semi - lagrangian method , which advances a physical variable by interpolating its profile between grid points and then following the characteristics backward in time .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite employed this method with the cubic b - spline interpolation .",
    "@xcite developed a semi - lagrangian scheme in a conservative form with an upwind - biased lagrange polynomial interpolation , called the positive and flux conservative ( pfc ) scheme .",
    "the pfc preserves mass and positivity .",
    "proposed a non - oscillatory type of the pfc scheme .",
    "the above and many popular schemes consider the time integration of a single physical variable . on the other hand ,",
    "the concept of `` multi - moment '' that treats multiple dependent variables has been proposed . @xcite and @xcite developed a multi - moment semi - lagrangian scheme , called the constrained interpolation profile ( cip ) scheme .",
    "the cip scheme employs the cubic hermite interpolation .",
    "difference of the cip scheme from the others is that it treats not only a profile but also its first derivative in space as dependent variables , and their governing equations are solved as coupled equations .",
    "the cip scheme provides comparable or better solutions even with a relatively smaller number of grid points compared to the others , although it requires a higher memory cost to store multiple dependent variables . due to its high capability",
    ", the cip scheme has been applied not only to the vlasov simulation @xcite but also to magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "conservative schemes are preferable for the vlasov simulation , because the integration of the distribution function in phase space is equal to the number of particles . @xcite and @xcite also proposed a conservative form of the cip , called the cip - csl2 ( cip - conservative semi - lagrangian scheme with a second - order polynomial ) .",
    "the cip - csl2 scheme treats point values of a profile and its cell - integrated values as dependent variables .",
    "the cell - integrated value is advanced in a conservative form to guarantee the conservation of mass .",
    "therefore , the cip - csl2 scheme will be more suitable than the cip scheme for the vlasov simulation .",
    "various cip - csl type schemes have been proposed thus far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a non - oscillatory type of the cip - csl scheme was proposed by @xcite , and is successfully extended to fluid dynamic equations @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a conservative eulerian scheme , which is applied to the electrostatic vlasov - poisson simulation @xcite .",
    "although there has been a number of numerical schemes , they have been applied mainly to the electrostatic vlasov - poisson simulation .",
    "there is an increasing interest for the application of electromagnetic vlasov simulations to magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "however , the vlasov simulation of magnetized plasmas is more difficult than the electrostatic one , because no suitable scheme for solving the gyro motion ( solid body rotation in velocity space ) has been established thus far .",
    "@xcite proposed a rigorous time - splitting method to solve the solid body rotation problem using the one - dimensional pfc scheme , called the backsubstitution .",
    "even with this method , however , we find considerable numerical diffusion in a long time calculation that causes non - physical plasma heating during the gyration .",
    "for this reason , it is still quite limited to deal with plasma phenomena such as heating and acceleration on the basis of the electromagnetic vlasov simulation . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new numerical scheme for the advection equation , specifically designed to solve the vlasov equation in magnetized plasmas .",
    "we first argue in section [ sec : concept - mma - scheme ] that it is important to preserve high order moments of the distribution function to reduce numerical diffusion , on the basis of the concept of the conservation of the information entropy .",
    "we develop an advection scheme , in which not only point values of a profile but also its zeroth to second order piecewise moments are treated as dependent variables .",
    "details of the scheme are described in sections [ sec : mma - one - dimension ] and [ sec : mma - two - dimension ] for one and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "benchmark tests of the scheme and its application to electrostatic and electromagnetic vlasov simulations are presented in sections [ sec : numer - tests - mma1d ] and [ sec : numer - tests - mma2d ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider that the conservation of the information entropy is essential to develop a dissipationless scheme for the advection equation .",
    "when a profile @xmath2 follows the advection equation , @xmath3 , its entropy function , @xmath4 , also follows the equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the self - information function of @xmath7 , and @xmath2 is regarded as the probability function that rapidly decreases toward @xmath8 .",
    "the conventional information entropy function is @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite defined more general function of the form , @xmath10 .",
    "the shape of a profile will be preserved during the advection with constant velocity when its information entropy is conserved in a numerical simulation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position in physical space . however , it is difficult to develop an advection scheme that exactly guarantees the entropy conservation , because @xmath6 is nonlinear in general .",
    "then , we approximate it by expanding in the taylor series with respect to @xmath7 , @xmath13dx.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation tells that the entropy can be described as a linear combination of the zeroth to @xmath14-th order moments , @xmath15 .",
    "we then consider that better conservation of the entropy may be achieved by preserving information of high order moments .",
    "for example , the entropy of a gaussian profile , @xmath16/\\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\sigma_x$ ] , is described by up to the second order moment , @xmath17.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the gaussian profile is the most fundamental distribution in velocity space that maximizes the entropy in thermal equilibrium , preserving the entropy of this profile is crucially important for vlasov simulations .",
    "we speculate from this discussion that it is essential to treat , at least , up to the second order moment as dependent variables , to keep the characteristics of the vlasov equation .",
    "a `` multi - moment advection ( mma ) '' scheme is designed to treat the zeroth to second order moments as well as the profile itself as dependent variables , and advance them on the basis of their governing equations .",
    "we consider the time evolution of a one - dimensional profile @xmath18 and its zeroth to second order moments defined as @xmath19 the conservative advection equation of @xmath20 and governing equations of the moments are written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity . here",
    ", the conservative advection equation of @xmath20 is cast into the advective form .",
    "equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) are obtained by multiplying equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) by @xmath23 and then integrating over space .",
    "note that the cip - csl2 scheme considers equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) ( @xmath24 only ) .",
    "hereafter , we assume the constant velocity case , @xmath25 , because we are concerned with the vlasov equation .    to solve a set of these equations , the one - dimensional mma scheme ( mma1d ) treats four dependent variables ;",

    "the two - dimensional scheme allows us to solve the gyro motion and the @xmath251 drift motion for a long time with little numerical heating .",

    "although the present scheme correctly solves the moments up to the second order , the entropy is numerically increased in the two stream instability ( section [ sec : two - stre - inst ] ) , by the dissipation of fine structures in velocity space .",
    "this is understood that the perturbation of lower order moments decreases and higher order moments contribute to the entropy when the so - called filamentation phenomena proceed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the present scheme is designed specifically to solve the advection and rotation in velocity space in the vlasov equation . in our vlasov simulation code ,",
    "the cip - csl2 scheme has been employed to solve the advection in configuration space .",
    "we note that , however , another scheme can be applied to the advection in configuration space and be combined with the present scheme .",
    "several advection schemes proposed for vlasov simulations are designed to preserve positivity and non - oscillatory property , in order to suppress a non - physical growth of plasma waves caused by numerically - produced positive gradient in velocity space .",
    "@xcite argued that the positivity - preserving and non - oscillatory are important properties for reliable vlasov simulations . on the other hand",
