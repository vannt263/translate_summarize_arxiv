    "practical applications of quantum technologies will require the controlled production of many - body correlated quantum states , in particular ground states ( g.s . ) .",
    "it is thus desirable to find efficient mechanisms for their fast production .",
    "bosonic josephson junctions ( bjjs ) are among the simplest systems whose ground states already contain many - body correlations beyond mean field .",
    "schematically , bjjs are ultracold bosonic vapors in which , to a good approximation , the atoms populate only two mutually interacting single - particle levels .",
    "recently , bjjs have been studied experimentally by several groups  @xcite .",
    "current nomenclature calls external josephson junctions those in which the two levels are spatially separated , usually by means of a potential barrier  @xcite . in internal josephson junctions instead , the two levels are internal to the same atom  @xcite .",
    "the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian provides a suitable theoretical description of both internal and external junctions  @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of this simple hamiltonian is that , within subspaces of fixed number of particles , it can be mapped into an su(2 ) spin model .",
    "this makes these systems suitable to study very squeezed spin states  @xcite , as proven experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we described how a method to shortcut the adiabatic following in elementary quantum mechanical systems could be applied to produce of spin - squeezed states in bjjs .",
    "in particular , we adapted a simple method developed for harmonic oscillators in which the frequency could be varied in time  @xcite . in  @xcite we described the most straightforward application , where the inter - atomic interaction strength was the control parameter .",
    "this is nowadays a parameter that can be varied experimentally but it is difficult to control with good accuracy on the time scales considered . to overcome this problem , here we will extend the earlier protocol by varying instead the linear coupling between the states ( atomic levels ) in internal junctions  .",
    "this variation can be done with fantastic accuracy  @xcite and we shall focus on this case .    the protocols to shortcut adiabatic evolution are generally designed to drive in a finite time a system from some initial state to a final state that could be reached adiabatically .",
    "an important advantage of these protocols is that they can , in addition , aim at controlling other properties during the evolution , e.g. reducing transient energy excitation , noise sensitivity or optimizing other quantities of interest  @xcite .",
    "in addition , formulas to achieve shortcuts to adiabatic following are analytic for harmonic oscillator hamiltonians  @xcite . from the experimental point of view the methods are capable to produce a stationary eigenstate of the hamiltonian at the final time , making it unnecessary to stop or freeze the dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "similarly , for @xmath81 ms , the final coherence and number squeezing are essentially those of the corresponding ground state ( a , b ) .",
    "this is an important finding , as for instance the linear ramping produces roughly half of the number squeezing as compared to the adiabatic or shortcut protocol .",

    "we have presented a method to produce ground states of bosonic josephson junctions for repulsive atom - atom interactions using protocols to shortcut the adiabatic following .",
    "we inverse - engineer the accurately controllable linear coupling @xmath6 by mapping a schrdinger - like equation for the ( imbalance ) wavefunction of the josephson junction onto an ordinary harmonic oscillator for which shortcut protocols can be set easily .",
