    "classically , a topologically stable field configuration may be regarded as lying in a potential well in an infinite dimensional configuration space .",
    "two solutions in different sectors are separated by an infinite potential barrier by virtue of the topology .",
    "quantum mechanically , a particle can not sit at the bottom of a well : it always possesses a zero point energy dependent on the shape of the well bottom .",
    "the analogous situation applies to fields also .",
    "we wish to find the zero point energy associated with a kink configuration in a certain lattice sine - gordon model .",
    "the model was chosen because it has an exact lattice version of the topological lower bound on kink energy , and an explicit static kink which saturates this bound . the calculation is performed in the weak coupling approximation , by performing a taylor expansion of the potential about the kink configuration , truncating the expansion at quadratic order .",
    "we then find the normal modes of the truncated system , reducing the problem to that of an infinite set of decoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "on quantization , each contributes a zero point energy .",
    "summing over all oscillators gives an infinite total .",
    "if we similarly approximate the vacuum well - bottom we can derive the zero point energy associated with the trivial vacuum .",
    "this is also infinite .",
    "the `` physical '' quantity required is the energy difference between the kink and the vacuum , since we can always _ define _ the vacuum energy to be zero .",
    "this quantity , analogous to the casimir energy of quantum electrodynamics @xcite , turns out to be finite and less than the classical energy of the kink .",
    "since the model possesses only discrete translation symmetry , the normal mode frequencies , and hence the casimir energy depend periodically on the kink position .",
    "calculation of the normal mode frequencies amounts to finding the eigenvalues of an infinite - order , tridiagonal , symmetric matrix . in practice",
    "this is not possible and the system must be truncated symmetrically about the kink centre , ignoring the large @xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "it is possible to show that the resulting quantum energy correction must be negative , for any size of truncated system .",

    "the ground state energy of a kink at @xmath18 is @xmath46 where the sum may be taken over all eigenvalues since the one we wish to omit is zero anyway .",
    "there is no reason to expect either @xmath47 or @xmath48 to converge to a finite sum but one would expect finite casimir energy @xmath49 since the lattice spacing @xmath2 has effectively cut off the ultra violet divergence problems of the continuum model .",
    "we must still take care when manipulating the divergent sums of ( [ eq : qme ] ) that they are suitably regulated before being combined .",
    "the method of regulation is determined by practical considerations : we calculate @xmath47 and @xmath48 on a finite lattice , compute @xmath50 and then allow the lattice size to grow large . in practice",
    "we must truncate the lattice to finite size anyway in order to solve the kink matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "we now address the problem of finding the eigenvalues of the vacuum and kink @xmath30 matrices , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "let us first consider the vacuum matrix , obtained from ( [ eq : wexp ] ) by substituting @xmath53 : @xmath54.\\ ] ] this is a very simple matrix .",
    "all the diagonal entries are equal , as are all the upper and lower diagonal entries .",
    "consequently , the spectrum of the truncated matrix of order @xmath55 is known exactly ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath56 @xmath57 . in the @xmath58 limit",
    "this is strikingly similar to the dispersion relation for phonons on the lattice @xcite because the normal modes of oscillation about the vacuum _ are _ phonons .",
    "the question of making sense of the @xmath58 limit of @xmath59 is irrelevant because there is no hope of finding the exact spectrum of the kink @xmath30 matrix , @xmath60 . substituting ( [ eq : kink ] ) into ( [ eq : wexp ] ) we obtain an explicit expression for @xmath61 .",
    "since the kink is highly localized ( provided @xmath62 is not too small ) , at large @xmath63 the kink configuration rapidly approaches neighbouring vacuum minima so that @xmath64 tend to @xmath65 away from the matrix centre . the suggestion ,",
    "then , is that we truncate the lattice , pinning all the large @xmath63 degrees of freedom , for which the kink and vacuum configurations are essentially identical , to their classical values .",
    "the resulting finite problem may be solved numerically .",
    "one can prove that , whatever the order , @xmath55 ( an odd integer ) , of the symmetrically truncated system ( that is , truncated symmetrically about the lattice site @xmath66 ) , the casimir energy must be negative .",
    "the proof rests on the observation that , truncated to order @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the symmetric , tridiagonal matrix , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the diagonal matrix with elements , @xmath73.\\ ] ] now , @xmath72 manifestly has negative semi - definite eigenvalues , and @xmath69 is a special case of a class of matrices whose spectra are known to be negative semi - definite @xcite .",

    "we have assumed , on physical grounds , that @xmath84 the casimir energy of the order @xmath55 truncated system converges to a constant value as @xmath55 grows large . numerical evidence for this is presented in figure 1 , a graph of @xmath55 against @xmath85 for various values of @xmath62 .",
    "convergence is very fast for large @xmath62 ( the @xmath86 curve is essentially flat for @xmath87 ) but much slower for small @xmath62 .",
    "of course , this happens because the more finely space is discretized , the more degrees of freedom the kink structure is spread over .",
    "there is also a much smaller exacerbating effect due to the @xmath62 dependence in the kink solution , ( [ eq : kink ] )  large @xmath62 kinks are sharper in `` real '' @xmath88 space than small @xmath62 kinks .",
    "note that , as proved above , the casimir energy is always negative and that its magnitude grows large for small @xmath62 as we expect from consideration of the unrenormalized continuum model @xcite .",
    "although @xmath89 was chosen for these data , the rates of convergence are virtually independent of @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the casimir energy of suitably truncated systems is plotted as a function of kink position @xmath18 in figure 2 .",
    "it attains its maxima where the kink is located exactly on a lattice site and its minima where the kink is halfway between two sites . for large @xmath62",
    "the resemblance to a sinusoidal curve is remarkable : figure 3 shows a sinusoidal fit for @xmath91 .",
    "the resemblence deteriorates as @xmath62 decreases because numerical errors become relatively large as the casimir energy barrier @xmath92/m$ ] decreases ( figure 4 ) .",
    "striking though the similarity is , the author can find no analytic evidence to support the claim that @xmath93 really _ is _ sinusoidal .",
    "it is the casimir energy barrier ( figure 4 ) which is physically most relevant and which will directly affect classical kink dynamics . in the continuum limit full continuous translation symmetry",
    "is recovered , so the barrier should disappear , as is indicated by the plot . in fact , in common with other ( classical kinetic ) discreteness effects of the lsgm @xcite , the barrier is very small for all @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 for a given @xmath96 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath17 , as it appears to be , then given that @xmath97 , the barrier should approach a finite value in the @xmath98 limit .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that it does and that this value is around @xmath99 .",
    "we have seen that quantum fluctuations around the kink configuration spoil the level kink valley bottom by introducing a casimir energy which depends periodically on the ( classical ) kink position .",
    "this energy has been computed numerically in the weak coupling approximation and found to be approximately sinusoidal , maximum when @xmath100 and minimum when @xmath101 , the difference between these extrema being large for large @xmath62 but rapidly vanishing in the continuum limit .",
    "it is superficially similar to the peierls - nabarro potential of the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite ( the conventional lattice sine - gordon model ) but is entirely different in origin , being a purely quantum effect .",
    "since the casimir effect is a genuine physical phenomenon , experimentally verified in the context of quantum electrodynamics , we are led to the conclusion that classical kinks in this lattice model may be `` pinned '' by the quantum mechanics of the orthogonal modes .    finally , following a suggestion by gibbons and manton @xcite we could attempt to include the effect of variation of orthogonal mode frequencies on the quantized geodesic approximation of kink motion by including the casimir energy as an extra potential term in the hamiltonian : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the covariant laplacian on the submanifold of static kinks .",
    "given the periodic nature of @xmath50 , we would then expect band structure in the kink spectrum .",
    "there are two objections to this .",
    "first , the kink kinetic terms are of order @xmath104 ( due to the large kink mass ) , while the potential was expanded only up to order @xmath105 , so the perturbative expansion is not consistent .",
    "second , picking out the @xmath106 kinetic term at order @xmath104 is also not consistent because there are several other kinetic terms at this order neglected in equation ( [ eq : ci ] ) .",
    "this may be seen by rexpressing the kinetic hamiltonian of the full quantum field theory , @xmath107 ( an infinite dimensional laplacian ) in terms of the kink translation mode @xmath18 and the orthogonal modes @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting formula is very messy , and includes order @xmath104 cross terms with derivatives @xmath109 and @xmath110 in addition to the terms included in ( [ eq : ci ] ) .",
    "the analogous expression in the continuum model @xcite can be greatly simplified by boosting to the kink s rest frame , but this trick is not available to us here .",
    "these considerations cast doubt on the suggested procedure , at least in this case .",
    "however , one should note that a naive expansion of the hamiltonian in @xmath4 may not be the most physically relevant procedure when considering quantum kink dynamics .",
    "for example , one could imagine making the demand that the kink s `` speed '' ( in an appropriate quantum sense ) be of order @xmath105 .",
    "given the kink s large mass in the weak coupling approximation , one would then expect the kink kinetic term to _ dominate _ the hamiltonian .",
    "so the legitimacy of the suggested procedure remains an open and somewhat controversial question .",
