    "the main objective of the _ spectrum - roentgen - gamma _ ( _ srg _ ) observatory is to perform a sensitive all - sky survey in the 0.312 kev energy band with the erosita @xcite and art - xc @xcite telescopes .",
    "the survey ( see  [ s : tasks ] for details ) will last 4 years and consist of 8 repeated complete scans of the sky .",
    "the telescopes will be scanning the sky in great circles as a result of the spacecraft s rotation with a period of 4  hours around its axis pointed at the sun .",
    "this observational strategy provides the possibility of studying variable and transient x - ray sources on three characteristic time - scales corresponding to 1 ) the duration of a single scan of a point source , @xmath1  s , 2 ) the duration of a single observation of a source , @xmath5  day ( consisting of @xmath6 consecutive rotation cycles , depending on the ecliptic latitude ) , and 3 ) the duration of a single all - sky scan ( 6  months ) .",
    "information on temporal behaviour can greatly assist in identifying the types of x - ray sources discovered during the erosita all - sky survey .",
    "in particular , the x - ray afterglows of cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) form a class of bright transient sources that usually demonstrate power - law decay during the first hours and days after the burst ( see @xcite for a review ) . therefore",
    ", grb afterglows can manifest themselves by a distinct variability pattern on the time - scale of several successive erosita scans , which in principle makes it possible to identify such events by analysing the x - ray light curves of sources detected during the all - sky survey .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate the detection rates of grb x - ray afterglows during the erosita all - sky survey .",
    "previously , @xcite carried out a search for afterglows of untriggered grbs in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) data and found 23 afterglow candidates . however , a closer examination indicated that at least half and perhaps the majority of these events were flares of late - type stars . taking into account erosita s better ( by a factor of @xmath7 in the 0.52  kev energy band ) sensitivity and a factor of 2 larger sky coverage ( survey duration times field of view area ) of the planned survey",
    ", we can expect a significantly larger number of detected grb afterglows .",
    "we note in passing that in addition to afterglows , the _ srg _ all - sky survey may also detect a significant number of grbs themselves , depending on the unknown shape of the @xmath2@xmath8 distribution of grbs at very low fluences .",
    "this topic will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the main motivation for such a study is that erosita can provide the _ first unbiased sample of x - ray afterglows_. the problem with all existing samples of afterglows is that they are based on trigerred grbs and thus determined by the energy range , sensitivity and strategy of the particular grb experiments . as we discuss in this paper , erosita may find a significant number of afterglows associated with grbs falling near or below the detection threshold and/or having the spectral maximum outside the energy range of existing grb monitors .",
    "this will make it possible to construct an unbiased distribution of x - ray afterglow fluxes and will also provide valuable constraints on the shape of the grb @xmath2@xmath8 distribution at low prompt emission fluences .",
    "in addition , erosita may find a significant number of orphan afterglows , i.e. events without preceding prompt high - energy emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , and afterglows associated with failed grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) , which will provide interesting constraints on the properties of relativistic jets produced during the collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the _ srg _ observatory will be launched into the l2 point of the earth  sun system and the first 4 years of the mission will be devoted to performing an all - sky x - ray survey .",
    "the satellite will be rotating with a period of @xmath9  hours around its axis pointed at the sun ( or a few degrees away from the sun , the exact strategy is still to be decided ) , with the telescopes observing the sky at right angles to the axis .",
    "consequently , the rotation axis will be moving at a speed of 1  deg per day following the orbit of the l2 point around the sun . as a result ,",
    "a complete survey of the sky will be done every 6  months and a total of 8  scans will be completed over the course of the mission . with the 1  deg - diameter field of view ( fov ) , erosita will be scanning the sky with a speed @xmath10  deg@xmath11 per minute ( where @xmath12 is the all - sky area ) .",
    "a typical position on the sky will pass through the fov during 6 consecutive spacecraft rotations once during each all - sky scan .",
    "a single scan of a point source will last @xmath13  s , the time it takes for the source to cross the fov through its centre .",
    "therefore , most of the sky will receive an exposure @xmath14  ks by the end of the survey .",
    "in reality , the received exposure gradually increases towards the ecliptic poles , so that the ecliptic caps will receive up to @xmath15  ks by the end of the survey @xcite .",
    "this also means that any sources located in these regions will transit the erosita fov during more than 6 successive rotation cycles .",
    "below we consider two scientifically interesting tasks for the _ srg_/erosita survey : i ) identification of afterglows without any information about the bursts proper and ii ) search for afterglows of triggered ( by instruments aboard _ srg _ or other observatories ) grbs .      _",
    "swift_/xrt observations @xcite have demonstrated that the light curves of grb x - ray afterglows can not always be described by a power law and frequently not even by a combination of several power laws ( usually this is the case when one or more flares are observed ) , as had been previously suggested by _ bepposax _ observations of late - time afterglows @xcite . however , erosita should be most efficient for studying grb afterglows during the period from @xmath16 to @xmath17  s after the prompt emission , which usually corresponds to the phase of smooth decay with a slope of approximately 1.2 ( see segment iii in the cartoon in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus base our treatment below on the requirement that grb x - ray afterglow candidates have power - law - like light curves .",
    "consider the light curve of a grb afterglow in the 0.52 kev energy band ( where erosita is most sensitive ) of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the x - ray flux at 12  hours after the prompt emission and @xmath20 is the age of the afterglow , i.e. the time since its onset ( in hours ) .",
    "such an afterglow can be detected by erosita until the time @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the erosita detection limit for one ( @xmath13  s long ) scan of a point source . if @xmath23 , a light curve containing up to n+1 points can be obtained under suitable spacecraft orientation conditions . in principle , three consecutive flux measurements , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are sufficient to reconstruct a power - law - shaped light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ obs ] ) .",
    "indeed , in this case we have three equations for determining three parameters : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , or equivalently , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the age of the afterglow during the first successful scan .",
    "specifically , the decay index @xmath28 can be found by solving the equation @xmath31 making further determination of @xmath30 and @xmath27 trivial .",
    "however , in reality @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the _ measured _ values of the afterglow flux , and it is also necessary to take into account the uncertainties associated with flux measurement .",
    "we thus propose as the criteria for identification of afterglow candidates that :    1 .",
    "there is a sequence of 3 successive scans with the measured fluxes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) exceeding @xmath35 ; 2 .",
    "the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 fluxes are consistent within their uncertainties with a power - law decay with @xmath36 ( see appendix 1 ) ; 3 .",
    "the fluxes measured in scans preceding the @xmath32 measurement , if there are any , are consistent with zero ( to ensure that there is no rising phase that would contradict a grb afterglow origin ) ; 4 .",
    "the fluxes ( or upper limits ) measured in scans succeeding the @xmath34 measurement , if there are any , confirm the power - law decay .",
    "the second of the conditions listed above , together with the characteristics of erosita telescope , implies ( see appendix  1 ) that the effective limit ( @xmath35 ) for detection and identification of grb afterglows lies between @xmath37 and @xmath38  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 ( 0.52  kev ) . here",
    ", the higher value is more conservative , as it allows for the possibility of a significant background contribution to the detected photon flux and some uncertainty in the characteristics of the erosita telescope ; we will use both values for our estimates .",
    "[ obs ]    thus , for confident identification of a candidate afterglow we need at least three consecutive detections above the threshold specified above .",
    "this suggests that only afterglows with @xmath41  hr are useful for our purposes .",
    "furthermore , such afterglows can only be suitable if detected for the first time within @xmath42 after the onset of the afterglow .",
    "in other words , @xmath43 defines the time depth of an interesting afterglow . for a given afterglow",
    ", we can further introduce a survey volume @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the survey area , and a survey rate @xmath46 . as was mentioned above , the erosita scanning speed @xmath47 .",
    "however , because erosita will scan a given position in the sky typically for a total of 6 consecutive rotation cycles , only half of the fov ( see fig .",
    "[ obs ] ) is actually suitable for producing the first point of an at least three - point light curve .",
    "furthermore , only 1/3 of this area has the full time depth @xmath43 , where @xmath48  hr  the erosita all - sky scan period , but because the rate of grbs with @xmath49 is extremely small , the associated error is negligible . ] .",
    "for the remaining two thirds , the time depth equals @xmath50 , because a given event could already be detected in the fov @xmath9  hr before .",
    "thus , effectively @xmath51 let @xmath52 be the probability density function of @xmath43 for grb afterglows , normalised to some total grb rate per unit solid angle , @xmath53 .",
    "then , the expected number of grb afterglows detected ( and identified as such ) by erosita during a unit time interval is @xmath54 where @xmath55 therefore , to estimate the expected number of grb afterglows , one needs to specify the function @xmath52 , which can in principle be derived from observed distributions of grb fluences , afterglow x - ray fluxes and decay indices .    before proceeding to accurate estimates , it is useful to make some simplifying assumptions and determine a lower limit for the expected number of grb afterglows analytically .",
    "due to the form of equation  ( [ svol ] ) , it is natural to divide all potentially interesting afterglows into three categories :    1 .",
    "@xmath56  hr , hence @xmath57 and @xmath58 , 2 .",
    "@xmath59 , hence @xmath60  hr and @xmath61 , 3 .",
    "@xmath62  hr , hence @xmath63  hr and @xmath64 .",
    "swift_/xrt sample of grb afterglows is consistent with a lognormal distribution of @xmath27 ( 210  kev ) with @xmath65  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "assuming a crab - like x - ray spectrum with a photon index @xmath67 and fixing the light curve slope at @xmath68 , we find that for @xmath69  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 ( 0.52  kev ) , approximately half of all _ swift_/xrt grb afterglows have @xmath70  hr and thus fall into the third category described above .",
    "taking into account only such ( bright ) events , the total rate of afterglows detected by erosita will be @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the average over the lognormal distribution of fluxes for @xmath27 ( 0.52  kev ) @xmath73 . given that @xmath9  hr and assuming a total rate of grbs @xmath74 per year ( which corresponds to the _ swift _ detection rate recalculated to the full - sky area @xcite ) , we obtain that @xmath75 this is a conservative lower limit on the total afterglow detection rate by erosita . in reality , the detection rate should be higher owing to the contribution of weaker afterglows ( @xmath76 ) , but the result should be sensitive to the shape of the @xmath2@xmath8 distribution of grb fluences .",
    "we obtain more accurate estimates in  [ s : simul ] using monte carlo simulations .",
    "a different situation arises if a grb monitor provides sufficiently accurate coordinates of a grb . in this case",
    ", just one detection will be sufficient to identify its x - ray afterglow and measure its flux at a known time after the prompt emission .",
    "the effective erosita detection limit for this task is @xmath77  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 ( see appendix  2 ) , i.e. somewhat lower than for task 1 discussed above .    in the considered case ,",
    "@xmath78 and the whole fov is suitable for the first ( and the only needed ) detection of an afterglow : 1/6 of the fov has time depth @xmath79 and the other 5/6 of the fov @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , @xmath81 similar to task 1 , we can find a lower limit on the erosita afterglow detection rate for task  2 using information on _ swift _ x - ray afterglows : @xmath82 this estimate is based on the optimistic assumption that at the time of the _ srg _ mission there is a grb monitor or collection of grb monitors that constantly cover the whole sky with sufficient senstivity ( corresponding to @xmath83 in 15 - 150 kev energy band ) and localization accuracy ( @xmath84 10 arcmin ) .",
    "for example , _",
    "swift_/bat provides such characteristics except that its sky coverage is only 1.4 sr ( half - coded ) .",
    "finally , we note the interesting possibility of searching with erosita for afterglows of grbs detected by the interplanetary network ( ipn , @xcite ) .",
    "ipn events are often localised ( by triangulation ) to a large annulus on the sky .",
    "the presence of a decaying x - ray source at the intersection of the erosita fov with such an annulus within the first hours  days after a grb would indicate the detection of an afterglow .",
    "as was described in  [ s : tasks ] , the _ srg _ all - sky survey will not be homogeneous : the total accumulated exposure ( per source ) will be significantly larger at high ecliptic latitudes relative to the ecliptic plane .",
    "the ecliptic caps will also be advantageous for studying x - ray transients , because a point source will pass through the erosita fov during more than 6 consecutive rotation cycles and can thus be monitored for significantly longer than 1  day .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of the grb x - ray afterglow sky as would be seen by erosita , taking the planned survey strategy into account .",
    "the simulation consisted of the following steps : 1 ) model the position of the erosita fov as a function of time ( by calculating the phases of rotation around the sun and the satellite s axis ) over the duration of the survey ( several years ) , 2 ) assume a total rate , flux distribution and light curve characteristics of afterglows , 3 ) use these parameters to draw afterglows in random celestial positions , 4 ) check if a given event falls into the erosita fov and satisfies the detection criteria for task  1 or task  2 specified above .",
    "in what follows , we concentrate on classical long ( @xmath85  s ) grbs .",
    "possible additional contributions of other classes of bursts are considered in  [ s : other ] .",
    "the most important and non - trivial part of the simulation is the definition of the intrinsic characteristics of the afterglow population .",
    "the problem here is that all samples of afterglows reported in the literature are probably biased relative to the true population of such events , because they are based on samples of grbs triggered above certain detection thresholds .",
    "in fact , the erosita all - sky survey might help reveal the intrinsic properties of the grb afterglow population .      the largest existing grb sample has been provided by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) @xcite . the @xmath2@xmath86 ( here @xmath87 is the peak photon flux in the 50300  kev energy band ) distribution of long bursts from this sample , corrected for the survey s efficiency function ,",
    "can be described by a number of models ( @xcite , hereafter s02 ) . in our simulations , we used simple approximations to some of these models ( namely to sf1,m and sf3,m from table  2 in s02 ) and their extrapolations to lower fluences .",
    "specifically , our minimal model m1 reproduces the measured @xmath2@xmath88 distribution of bursts above the batse detection limit and has a sharp cut - off below this threshold ; this model has nearly the same normalisation ( total grb rate ) as the sf1,m model in s02 .",
    "our medium model m2 is the same as m1 but extrapolated by a constant level to lower fluences ( down to @xmath89  erg  @xmath40 ) ; it has nearly the same normalisation as the sf3,m model in s02 and corresponds to increasing star formation at large ( @xmath90 ) redshifts ( see @xcite ) . finally , our maximal model m3 is the same as m2 but has an additional power - law component with a slope of 3/2 ( also extending down to @xmath89  erg  @xmath40 ) , whose normalisation is chosen so as to distort the observed batse distribution near its threshold by @xmath91  20% , just within the uncertainty of this distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such an additional component may be present due to the existence of low - luminosity grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although only a few such events have been detected and associated with nearby ( @xmath92 ) supernovae so far , the total rate of low - luminosity grbs in the universe can be much higher than that of classical ( high - luminosity ) grbs @xcite and such events occurring at moderate distances ( @xmath93 ) can emerge in large numbers at currently inaccessible low fluences .    to proceed to the statistical properties of grb afterglows ,",
    "we need to convert the batse distribution ( @xmath2@xmath88 ) of grb peak fluxes in the 50300  kev energy band to a distribution of grb fluences in the _",
    "swift_/bat energy band ( 15150  kev ) .",
    "to this end , we first convert peak photon fluxes from 50300  kev to 15150  kev by the method described in @xcite , which provides rather good agreement between the batse and bat @xmath2@xmath88 distributions , and then the 15150  kev peak photon fluxes to 15150  kev fluences s@xmath94 using the average ratio of these two quantities found for the bat sample @xcite . fig .  [ lognlogsf ] shows the resulting distributions ( hereafter @xmath2@xmath8 ) for the different grb population models described above .",

    "@xcite . due to the higher sensitivity of the latter",
    ", @xcite argued that the _ swift_/xrt sample has the least bias , hence we base our analysis on the properties of this sample .",
    "we need to make a conversion from the distribution of grb prompt emission fluences ( @xmath95 ) discussed above to a distribution of x - ray afterglow fluxes ( e.g. at 12  hours after the prompt emission , @xmath27 ) .",
    "a strong linear correlation was found between @xmath95 and @xmath27 for _ swift_/xrt grbs @xcite .",
    "we thus use this correlation to predict @xmath27 for a given @xmath95 but also take into account the scatter associated with the correlation .",
    "specifically , we distribute @xmath27 lognormally with variance @xmath96 around the expected value . in addition",

    "table  [ sum ] summarises the detection rates for task  1 and task  2 for the different considered models , obtained by averaging over a large number of simulated all - sky scans .",
    "the simulated rates are somewhat higher than the analytical lower limits presented in  [ s : tasks ] due to i ) the contribution of weak ( @xmath98 ) events neglected in the analytical calculation ( only relevant for the @xmath99 rate , see  [ s : tasks ] ) and ii ) the increased number of scans at high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "the differences in the rates obtained for various models ( m1 , m2 and m3 ) are associated with the contribution of low - fluence grbs .",
    "the @xmath100 rate is especially sensitive to such events , because erosita with its effective detection threshold ( @xmath101 ) may find a large number of afterglows from weak grbs that are below the detection threshold of the current and previously flown grb detectors .",

    "cgro_/batse for grb detection was similar , 50300  kev .",
    "this suggest that there might exist a population of grbs with ultra - hard prompt emission and moderate or undetectable signal in the hard x - ray band .",
    "this hypothesis can now be tested with the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ , which is sensitive from 30  mev to 100  gev and has a fov of @xmath102  sr @xcite . the detection rate of _",
    "fermi_/lat is @xmath103 bursts per year , which corresponds to @xmath104 bursts per year over the whole sky .",
    "all of the long grbs detected by lat so far occurred outside the bat fov .",
    "detailed analysis of prompt and afterglow emission properties of the lat - detected grbs @xcite indicates that although these grbs have the largest fluences ever observed , their afterglows still fall within the flux distribution of _ swift_/bat - triggered grbs , exactly near its upper boundary , whereas the spectral and temporal behaviour of the lat - triggered grb afterglows are quite similar to those of the bat - triggered ones .",
    "because the scatter in the x - ray afterglow fluxes of lat - triggered grbs is fairly small ( probably owing to the fairly poor statistics provided by less than 10 grbs in the current sample ) , some instructive estimates can be obtained assuming that all of these afterglows have some average form . using the data from @xcite",
    ", we find that a typical lat - triggered grb afterglow has @xmath105  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 ( 0.52  kev flux at 12 hours after the prompt emission ) and @xmath106 ( temporal decay index ) .",
    "thus , assuming an erosita detection limit per scan of @xmath107  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 , such afterglows can be detected by erosita up to @xmath108  hours after the prompt emission ( see sect .",
    "[ s : task1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the corresponding detection rate @xmath109 per year over the whole sky ( given a total rate of @xmath110 of such bursts per year ) .",
    "in addition , there might be faint ultra - hard grbs remaining below the lat detection limit but capable of producing x - ray afterglows detectable by erosita for more than 8 hours .",
    "however , by analogy with classical grbs ( see table  [ sum ] ) , the number of such afterglows is unlikely to exceed the number of afterglows associated with detectable ultra - hard grbs .",
    "we thus expect the total erosita detection rate of afterglows of ultra - hard grbs to be less than 1.5  per  year ( see table  [ typesum ] )",
    ".      there can also be x - ray afterglows associated with so - called x - ray flashes , originally burst - like ( shorter than 1000  s ) events detected in x - rays by the wide field camera on _ bepposax _ but not detected by the gamma - ray monitor on the same satellite @xcite .",
    "comprehensive studies based on data from _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite , _ hete-2 _",
    "@xcite and most recently _ swift _ @xcite have not found significant differences between the duration and sky distributions of xrfs and classical grbs .",
    "moreover , the spectral properties of xrf prompt emission were found to be similar to those of grbs , except that the peak energies @xmath111 ( of the prompt @xmath112 spectrum ) , peak fluxes @xmath113 and fluences @xmath114 of xrfs are much smaller .",
    "this suggests that x - ray flashes arise from the same phenomenon as grbs , continuing the grb population to low @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the wide - field x - ray monitor on board _",
    "hete-2 _ makes it possible to readily estimate the rate of observable xrfs in comparison with grbs , because its threshold for detection and localisation of bursts in terms of the peak photon number flux is only weakly dependent on @xmath116 , i.e. nearly the same for xrfs and grbs @xcite .",
    "based on the fluence ratio @xmath117 , out of a total of 45 bursts in the _ hete-2 _ sample there are 16  xrf , nearly half of which have @xmath118  kev and a peak flux of @xmath119  ph  s@xmath39  @xmath120 in the 50300  kev energy band . here",
    "we are interested in such events because i ) they seem to be missing from the @xmath2@xmath8 distribution of batse grbs ( see figures 16 and 17 in @xcite ) , and ii ) detection of such bursts by _ swift_/bat in its 15150  kev energy range is challenging .",
    "studies of xrf afterglow emission based on _ bepposax _ and _ hete-2 _ @xcite and on _ swift _",
    "@xcite samples have produced somewhat controversial results .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that xrf afterglow light curves are similar to those of classical grbs , including the break feature at late times @xcite .",
    "the xrf afterglow fluxes were also found to be not much lower than for grb afterglows . on the other hand , the afterglows of xrfs from the more extensive _",
    "swift_/xrt sample , consisting of bursts with @xmath121  kev , exhibit no break in the light curves and are weaker by a factor of 2 or more compared to that of classical grbs @xcite .",
    "to extend this result to xrfs with @xmath122  kev , we may assume that there is a positive correlation between prompt emission fluence and x - ray afterglow flux , i.e. the afterglows of such xrf should be fainter than those of xrfs with @xmath123  kev .",
    "putting all these facts together , we estimate that afterglows of xrfs with @xmath118  kev are approximately 4 times rarer and at least 2 times fainter than afterglows of typical _ swift _ bursts .",
    "therefore , the total detection rate of the former is expected at the level @xmath124 per year ( see table  [ typesum ] ) .",
    "even after considering various subclasses of grbs and xrfs , our account of afterglows that can be detected by erosita is still incomplete .",
    "an additional contribution may come from afterglows that are not preceded by prompt @xmath125- or x - ray emission , which are often referred to as orphan afterglows ( oa ) .",
    "the standard theory of grbs , dealing with strongly beamed emission of a highly relativistic ( initial lorentz factor @xmath126 ) jet , allows for the existence of three classes of oa : 1 ) on - axis afterglows , observed within the opening angle of the initial relativistic jet but outside its narrow @xmath125-ray emitting ( due to a larger lorentz factor ) component ; 2 ) off - axis afterglows , observed outside the initial jet after the jet break time , when the jet expands sideways @xcite ; and 3 ) afterglows of so - called failed grbs ( fgrb ) , associated with baryon - contaminated fireballs with an initial lorentz factor of much less than 100 but still greater than unity @xcite .",
    "the light curve of an off - axis oa should initially rise until a moment that approximately corresponds to the jet - break time of normal grb afterglows ( @xmath127  s , @xcite ) and then decay in the usual post - jet - break manner ( with a decay slope greater than 1.5 and typically near 2.0 , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , for such an afterglow to satisfy our task  1 identification criteria ( i.e. a power - law - like decay ) , the required three successive ( spanning 8  hours ) detections by erosita should take place after the moment of maximal flux . however , the x - ray flux at this stage will typically be already too low for detection .",
    "therefore , such off - axis events are unlikely to be found in significant numbers by erosita .",
    "as regards on - axis oas , @xcite summarised observational constraints provided by the numbers of x - ray transients and grbs detected by _",
    "ariel  5 _ , _ heao-1 _ , _ rosat _ and _ bepposax _ and concluded that the average ratio of the opening angle of grb jets to that of their @xmath125-ray emitting components is @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that erosita may find a comparable number of orphan afterglows to that of normal afterglows , i.e. several events per year ( see table  [ sum ] ) and can thereby improve the constraints on the structure of relativistic jets in grbs .",
    "as concerns failed grbs , their existence seems rather natural from a theoretical point of view , because it is hard to produce a pure ( in terms of the baryonic content ) highly relativistic flow .",
    "the collapsar model @xcite predicts a great variety in the baryon mass and released energy , and consequently in the initial lorentz factor @xmath128 of the produced fireball , among different events . in most cases ,",
    "@xmath128 is expected to be low ( @xmath129 ) , leading to fgrbs that have almost the same initial energy as normal grb fireballs ( @xmath130  erg ) but are polluted by baryons with mass @xmath131 .",
    "it has also been suggested that a large population of fgrbs could arise if the jet failed to break out of the progenitor star in the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "in such a case , a uv / soft x - ray thermal burst followed by an afterglow with some distinct features should be observed @xcite .",
    "it is practically impossible to predict the rate of such events , but erosita may shed light on this explored population .",
    "the results of this study imply that it should be possible to detect and identify , by the shape of the light curve , 48 x - ray afterglows associated with classical long grbs per year in the erosita all - sky survey data ( see table  [ sum ] ) .",
    "the exact number will depend on the shape of the @xmath2@xmath8 distribution of grbs at low fluences ( near the effective threshold of _ cgro_/batse and _ swift_/bat .",
    "in addition , erosita is expected to find a small number of afterglows associated with other classes of grbs such short bursts , gev bursts and x - ray flashes ( table  [ typesum ] ) .",
    "thus , by the end of the 4-year survey , a sample of at least 2040 x - ray afterglows can be accumulated .",
    "this sample , although smaller than the already existing samples of afterglows , will nevertheless be interesting for systematic studies of grbs and their afterglows because of its unbiased nature . in particular , it can be used to construct an unbiased distribution of x - ray afterglow fluxes and to obtain constraints on the shape of the @xmath2@xmath8 distribution of grbs .",
    "the total number of afterglows detected by erosita may prove higher , perhaps by a factor of 2 or more , due to orphan afterglows and failed grbs .",
    "the actual detection rate will thus provide interesting constraints on the properties of relativistic jets associated with the collapse of massive stars .    the proposed algorithm for searching afterglows of non - triggered grbs ( task  1 ) in the erosita data",
    "is based on checking if the light curve of a given source resembles a power - law decline .",
    "although such a procedure may erroneously identify a large number of other types of variable x - ray sources ( e.g. agn and stellar flares ) as grb afterglows , most of such contaminants should be easily revealed through cross - checking of successive erosita all - sky scans and cross - correlation with large - area optical and infrared source catalogues .",
    "we have also discussed the possibility of using the erosita data for searching for afterglows of triggered ( by any grb monitors ) grbs .",
    "since the coordinates of the triggered bursts will be known , erosita just needs to detect a few photons from the afterglow in one @xmath132  s scan . as a result ,",
    "the total number of such events can be large , @xmath133  per year depending on the @xmath2-@xmath8 function ( see table  [ sum ] ) , provided that at the time of the _ srg _ mission there are grb monitors covering most of the sky at any given time .",
    "x - ray afterglows detected in this way can be interesting for statistical studies addressing the same scientific problems as discussed above in relation to the search for afterglows of non - triggered grbs .    finally , although _ srg _ data transfer is planned to occur only once per day , accurate ( @xmath4 ) coordinates provided by erosita within @xmath134  day after the event on afterglows of grbs and orphan afterglows can be valuable for scheduling further follow - up observations .",
    "here we determine the erosita 0.52  kev detection limit @xmath35 for candidate grb afterglows .",
    "the question we need to answer is to what accuracy do we need to obtain three consecutive flux measurements , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , to be able to conclude with certainty that the x - ray flux is decaying as a power law ? because the result is mostly sensitive to @xmath34 ( i.e. the latest flux measurement ) , the condition @xmath135 must be fulfilled .    to this end , we simulated light curves of grb afterglows as would be measured by erosita , assuming that photon counts obey the poisson distribution .",
    "the mathematical problem consists of fitting the intrinsic afterglow parameters @xmath27 , @xmath136 and @xmath28 ( equation  [ decay ] ) given @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with their corresponding statistical uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the power - law slope can be derived analytically from equation  ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "we found that , if the intrinsic slope @xmath68 and we require the measured value of @xmath28 to lie in the range from @xmath137 to @xmath138 this conservatively broad range reflects the observed scatter in decay indecies taking into account the post - break phase @xcite ) , then @xmath34 should be measured with accuracy better than @xmath15% , i.e. the latest measurement must be based on at least 9 photons . figure  [ uncert ] illustrates this conclusion .",
    "it shows the result of multiple realisations of a light curve for fixed intrinsic parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath139  hr ( the time of the first flux measurement ) and @xmath34 corresponding to 9 photons .",
    "the resulting family of possible power - law solutions is bounded ( within @xmath140 ) by two curves that correspond to @xmath141 and @xmath142 . for a characteristic x - ray afterglow spectrum with a photon index @xmath67 and the preliminary erosita response matrix ( http://mpe.mpg.de/erosita/response/ )",
    ", the 9 counts limit corresponds to @xmath143  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 for a diametral transition of a source through the erosita fov .    in reality",
    ", the effective detection threshold might be somewhat higher than estimated above because there is some uncertainty in the afterglow spectral properties and characteristics of the erosita telescope .",
    "we estimate that @xmath144  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 can be regarded as a conservative value .",
    "in the case of task  2 , the effective afterglow flux limit is mainly determined by the background level of the erosita detectors .",
    "it is expected that in the 0.52  kev energy band , the cosmic x - ray background ( galactic and extragalactic ) will dominate over the particle background . after excluding bright extragalactic sources that will be detected as individual point sources , the total background count rate in the 0.52  kev energy band over the erosita fov",
    "is expected to @xmath145 counts per second @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath146 counts inside the region of half - power diameter ( hpd , @xmath147 ) of the erosita point spread function over a 40  s exposure time . according to the poisson distribution",
    ", the probability that 2 or more background photons will be detected by chance in the hpd region is @xmath148 . assuming that the position of a given grb is known to an accuracy of @xmath149 ( as is e.g. the case for grbs detected by _",
    "swift_/bat ) , the probability of finding 2 or more background events inside this localisation region is less than @xmath150 , which , however , will not provide 3@xmath151 confidence of source detection",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to demand at least 3 counts as the detection limit for task  2 .",
    "this corresponds to a flux limit of @xmath152  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 ( 0.52  kev ) .",
    "however , such a detection will provide poor information about the afterglow brightness . to allow the accuracy of flux measurement of at least @xmath153% and account for some remaining uncertainty in the erosita background level ,",
    "we adopt a more conservative value @xmath154  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath40 , which approximately corresponding to 4 counts from a point source in the localisation region .",
