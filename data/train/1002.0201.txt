    "the possible existence of meson - nucleus bound systems is now one of the hot topics in hadron physics .",
    "especially , an antikaon is expected to be bound in a finite nucleus , thanks to a strong attraction between an @xmath4 @xmath5 pair  @xcite , and recent experimental findings of the signature of such a kaon - nucleus bound state  @xcite have brought a heated debate on whether it really exists with a decay width narrow enough to be observed experimentally .    in contrast , the interaction between an @xmath1 meson and a nucleon are also known to be also attractive , while its strength is not well - determined .",
    "the @xmath6 scattering length has a large ambiguity , between @xmath7 and @xmath8 for its real part and between @xmath9 and @xmath10 for its imaginary part  @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to carry out neither an x - ray measurement of mesic atom nor a scattering experiment , in order to derive information on @xmath6 interaction , different from the case for an antikaon . instead",
    ", experimental data of hadronic production and photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons are mainly used in theoretical analyses .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath11 resonance plays a dominant role in near - threshold @xmath1 production , since it lies just about @xmath12 above the @xmath6 threshold , and strongly couples with the @xmath6 channel , as seen in its large decay branching ratio into @xmath13 ( 4560%  @xcite ) .",
    "if the existence of @xmath1-mesic nuclei is confirmed experimentally , experimental observables such as the binding energy and decay width will impose a constraint on theoretical models about ( in - medium ) @xmath6 interaction and the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "haider and liu predicted their existence for the first time  @xcite , by using the scattering length of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and they found a bound state with the mass number @xmath16 may exist . if the scattering length is larger than they applied , there may be a possibility for lighter @xmath1-mesic nuclei to exist .    in this paper , we discuss experimental ideas to explore @xmath6 interaction and @xmath1-mesic nuclei by using the ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) reactions on different nuclear targets which will be feasible at the j - parc facility .",
    "secondary particles , such as pions and kaons , are produced by the bombardment of intense proton beam accelerated by the j - parc @xmath19 proton synchrotron onto the production target .",
    "then , they are extracted and transported into experimental areas .    at present , there are two beamlines , k1.8 ( available momentum up to @xmath20 ) and k1.8br ( up to @xmath21 ) , and further beamlines are planned . for simplicity ,",
    "we discuss experimental plans at the k1.8br area , where most of the detectors for the e15 experiment  @xcite may be reused after a small modification .",
    "the e15 experiment aims to search for a deeply - bound kaonic nuclear state @xmath22 by the @xmath23(@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) reaction .",
    "the layout of the experimental area together with the detectors to be installed is shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath24 is transported through the k1.8br beamline , and momentum - analyzed .",
    "scattered neutrons by the ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) reaction on the helium-3 target are detected by the neutron counter , located @xmath26 downstream from the target .",
    "the decay particles of @xmath27 are detected by the cylindrical detector system which surrounds the target .",
    "their trajectories can be reconstructed by the cylindrical drift chamber installed in a solenoid magnet which operates at @xmath28 parallel to the beam axis .",
    "the cylindrical detector hodoscopes , which locates outside of the cdc , are used for the trigger purpose and the particle identification .",
    "recently , a new measurement of the @xmath23(@xmath24 , @xmath29 ) reaction in the e15 experiment , by adding a detector system for scattered protons , was proposed ( j - parc p28  @xcite ) , and the proposal has been approved as a part of the e15 experiment . because a beam sweeping magnet is installed downstream of the target , scattered protons",
    "are also bent away from the beam axis ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "hence , an array of tof counters for scattered protons will be located next to the charge veto counters for neutrons . in order to enable an inclusive measurement , a set of drift chambers",
    "will be installed downstream of the target , so that the trajectories of the protons can be reconstructed .",
    "the present experimental setup is , of course , optimized for the e15 experiment .",
    "however , the ( @xmath30 , @xmath25 ) and/or ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) reactions on a different nuclear target can be investigated with almost the same setup . as discussed below , it is vitally important to detect rescattered particles in the @xmath31 reaction and decay particles from @xmath1-mesic nuclei",
    ". therefore , the usage of the cylindrical detector system will be desirable , too .",
    "in this section , we consider a _",
    "double - scattering reaction _ : @xmath33 where both the protons in the final state are involved ( fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] ) .",
    "this reaction must be distinguished from a _ quasi - free reaction _ : @xmath34 where the proton in the deuteron is a spectator .",
    "[ fig2b ] ) .",
    "the double - scattering reaction is a two - step process , namely the quasi - free reaction ( [ eq2 ] ) followed by the rescattering : @xmath35 the experimental goal is to obtain the missing - mass spectrum for the @xmath36 reaction with tagging @xmath37 as the @xmath38 final state . it is expected that a bump corresponding to the @xmath11 resonance due to the rescattering ( [ eq3 ] ) will be observed in the spectrum .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath6 interaction at low energy , the beam momentum should not be far from the recoilless condition for the @xmath39 reaction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the optimal beam momentum will be around @xmath40 .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath11 ( @xmath41 ) resonance will be almost at rest ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , as expected .",
    "then , one possibility to separate the double - scattering reaction from the quasi - free one is to detect a proton from the @xmath42 decay ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "while a proton from the decay of a @xmath42 with its mass @xmath44 has its momentum of @xmath45 , the fermi momentum of a nucleon in the deuteron hardly exceed @xmath46 .",
    "moreover by detecting a decay proton , a missing @xmath1 can be identified by use of the missing - mass of the @xmath47 reaction .    from an experimental point of view , the present cdc for the e15 experiment does not allow for the detection of such a slow proton because of the existence of its inner support .",
    "for instance , the range of a @xmath46 proton is only @xmath48 in a plastic scintillator .",
    "accordingly , a target has to be thin enough , less than a few mm will be used , instead of liquid @xmath49 . ] , and we have to equip a new detector system between the cdc and the target .",
    "for example , it is considered to install two barrels of plastic scintillators with different distances from the center ; the counter in the inner barrel measures the total energy of a proton , and that in the outer barrel serves as a veto counter to confirm the proton is stopped in the inner counter .    by the way , the @xmath50 reaction has been investigated by several groups  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section increases very rapidly from the threshold ( center - of - mass energy @xmath51 ) , and reaches more than @xmath52 in the @xmath11 resonance region . while the bump below @xmath53 can be explained by the predominant contribution of the @xmath11 resonance , the cross section above @xmath54 is strongly model - dependent  @xcite .",
    "it is because more resonances , such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and so on , contribute to the reaction .",
    "a similar behavior should hold for the @xmath60 reaction , due to the isospin symmetry .",
    "therefore , an incident pion momentum around @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath62 , may be suitable in order to avoid difficulties in model calculations .",
    "a measurement with a higher beam momentum may provide information on different resonances , including the second @xmath42 resonance .",
    "it should be noted that not only @xmath1 but also @xmath17 and vector mesons ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) can propagate as an intermediate meson , even if the center - of - mass energy of the pion and the neutron is adjusted to the @xmath11 region .",
    "this is also the case for the @xmath65 reaction near the threshold , which has been experimentally studied by cosy-11 and cosy - tof ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "theoretical calculations for the @xmath66 reaction  @xcite take into account these intermediate mesons between two nucleons .",
    "therefore , a new calculation for the @xmath31 reaction , based on a model for the @xmath67 and @xmath66 reactions , is awaited .",
    "this novel reaction might reveal unique features , i.e. , a possibility to make a constraint to parameters such as the a @xmath68 coupling constant .",
    "it is worth noting that an analogous reaction has been already discussed with regard to the @xmath69 resonance . in the chiral unitary model",
    ", it is shown that a @xmath69 , which is dynamically generated in the meson - baryon scattering , is a superposition of two poles  @xcite . the lower pole ( @xmath70 ) and higher pole ( @xmath71 ) couple strongly with the @xmath72 and @xmath5 channel , respectively . in order to confirm that the resonance in the @xmath5 channel locates around @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 ,",
    "the scattering of @xmath75 has to be examined .",
    "however , it is impossible to produce the @xmath69 resonance in a direct @xmath76 scattering , because it lies below the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "jido  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed a two - step process of the @xmath77 reaction , where the resonance can be produced by the scattering of an nucleon in the deuteron and an intermediate antikaon , and compared their calculation with an old experiment by braun _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite invariant - mass spectrum . ] , but also @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 were identified as final states . ] in j - parc , an experimental proposal to investigate the @xmath81 reaction , together with the identification of the decay mode of @xmath69 into @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 has been submitted  @xcite .    turning back to the double - scattering reaction ( [ eq1 ] ) , the situation is different in that the @xmath11 resonance is above the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "nevertheless , there is a possibility that one can access information on the @xmath2 scattering , caused by an intermediate @xmath1 meson , which can not be investigated by a direct reaction with `` @xmath1 meson beam '' .",
    "after haider and liu predicted the existence of @xmath1-mesic nuclei in 1986  @xcite , @xmath1-nucleon and @xmath1-nucleus interaction have been of particular interest both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "observation of @xmath1-mesic nuclei , as well as investigation of near - threshold @xmath1 production , will provide much better understanding of the interaction .",
    "the taps / mami experiment investigated the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesic @xmath23 by the @xmath84 and @xmath85 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section of the coherent @xmath1 production exhibits a peak - like structure at the threshold .",
    "an enhancement of correlated @xmath86 pairs with relative angles near @xmath87 is also observed near the @xmath1 production threshold , which may be attributed to the decay of @xmath1-mesic nuclei . by a simultaneous fit of the cross sections for the two channels , the binding energy @xmath88 and the width @xmath89",
    "are obtained .",
    "however , hanhart claimed that it is not possible to conclude whether the observed enhancement corresponds to a bound state or a virtual state , due to the lack of statistics  @xcite .",
    "recently , the cosy - gem experiment investigated the @xmath90 reaction at the recoilless kinematics  @xcite .",
    "they observed back - to - back @xmath91-@xmath29 pairs , whose energy corresponds to @xmath11 at rest .",
    "the missing - mass spectrum , with requiring back - to - back @xmath91-@xmath29 pairs in coincidence , shows an enhancement below the @xmath92 threshold .",
    "they obtained the binding energy ( @xmath93 and the width ( @xmath94 ) of the @xmath95 system .",
    "both the experiments tagged a pair of a pion and a nucleon as the decay product of @xmath1-mesic nuclei .",
    "since an @xmath1 meson and a nucleon strongly couples with a @xmath11 resonance ( @xmath96 ) , a main decay channel is considered to be @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath98 decay , which has a large branching ratio in free space , is suppressed because of the pauli blocking , even if the state is above the @xmath1 emission threshold .",
    "other decay modes , namely @xmath99 and @xmath100 , also contributes to the total decay width .",
    "the width of @xmath101 decay is estimated to be negligibly small  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath97 is easiest to identify , as its back - to - back topology is a clean signal .",
    "historically , the first experiment to search for @xmath1-mesic nuclei was done at bnl by using the @xmath102 reaction on lithium , carbon , oxygen , and aluminum targets  @xcite , motivated by a theoretical calculation by liu and haider  @xcite .",
    "a peak structure corresponding to @xmath1-mesic nuclei was not observed for any target .",
    "we consider that it is worthwhile to reconsider this reaction for two reasons , and plan to carry out a new experiment at j - parc  @xcite .",
    "first , the proton spectrometer was set to @xmath103 against the beam in the bnl experiment , and the momentum transfer is as large as @xmath46 for the incident beam momentum @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . a theoretical calculation by nagahiro _",
    "_ revealed that many subcomponents of different configurations of a nucleon - hole and an @xmath1 meson will contribute with substantial fractions , and that they will mask a possible peak structure of @xmath1-mesic nuclei  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the recoilless condition can be satisfied by measuring a proton scattered at almost zero degree . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the magic momentum , for the @xmath1 energy @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath106 is the mass of an @xmath1 meson , is @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . in this condition",
    "only substitutional states are enhanced , since the angular momentum of the target nucleus is conserved after the reaction .",
    "secondly , the bnl experiment investigated only the inclusive reaction . a signal of @xmath1-mesic nuclei",
    ", if exists , may be overwhelmed by a large background irrelevant to @xmath1 production .",
    "such a background will be reduced by detecting @xmath109 pairs in back - to - back simultaneously .    taking these points into consideration",
    ", we proposed to study the @xmath110 reactions on @xmath111 target at j - parc  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath111 , in addition to @xmath112 as a candidate of the target , because of less contribution of a proton in the @xmath113-shell .",
    "it is replaced by an @xmath1 meson with its orbital angular momentum 1 after the reaction ( @xmath29-wave component ) , and it is foreseen that the structure from the @xmath114-wave component from a proton in the @xmath115-shell is much more interesting than that from the @xmath29-wave component .",
    "furthermore , the missing - mass spectrum will be affected by the in - medium property of the @xmath116 resonance .",
    "_ derived the @xmath1-nucleus optical potentials , based on two kinds of chiral models  _ chiral doublet model _ and _ chiral unitary model _  and calculated the spectrum for each potential  @xcite .",
    "in the chiral doublet model , the @xmath96 is regarded as the chiral partner of the nucleon , and the mass gap between @xmath96 and @xmath18 decreases in a finite density because of partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "thereby , a level crossing between the @xmath96-@xmath117 and @xmath1 modes may take place in a nucleus , which results in a deeply - bound @xmath1 state and a bump structure in the unbound region .",
    "on the other hand , the mass gap will not change largely in nuclear medium in case of the chiral unitary model . a shallow bound state , which is similar to the result in ref .  ,",
    "will appear in the missing - mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , we expect to obtain information on the in - medium @xmath96 property in relation with the level crossing , via a missing - mass spectroscopy covering the unbound region as well as the bound region .",
    "we discussed experimental ideas to utilize the @xmath118 reactions for two purposes : investigation of the properties of the @xmath11 resonance , and search for @xmath1-mesic nuclei .",
    "it seems that both studies will shed light on the @xmath1-nucleon and @xmath1-nucleus interaction .",
