    "in source localization using antenna arrays in radar , sonar and communication systems , the underdetermined situation @xcite , where the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors , has been paid special attentions .    in order to detect more sources ,",
    "covariance - based algorithms have been explored . in these algorithms , the degree of freedom ( dof ) , which is measured by the number of distinct cross correlation terms in the associated difference co - array @xcite , plays an important role in determining the number of sources",
    "the array can identify . in @xcite ,",
    "the khatri - rao ( kr ) subspace approach is developed .",
    "the dof of an n - element uniform linear array ( ula ) is increased to @xmath0 by exploiting the self - khatri - rao product structure of the array manifold matrix and @xmath1 sources can be identified with the kr - music algorithm .",
    "the computational complexity turns into a noticeable issue because of the high dimension of the virtual array manifold .",
    "although a dimension reduction strategy is adopted in @xcite , subspace decomposition and spectral search are still computationally expensive due to the complex - valued operations in the algorithm .",
    "deploying the sensors with nonuniform spacings can raise the dof and hence help the covariance - based algorithms detect more sources in the underdetermined situation .",
    "nonuniform linear arrays , like the minimum redundancy array ( mra ) @xcite and the non - redundant array ( nra ) @xcite , have been designed to enhance the dof .",
    "however , no general analytical formulations can be provided to express the array geometry or the dof due to the lack of regularity in sensor deployment in mra and nra . lately ,",
    "two types of nonuniform linear arrays , the co - prime array and the nested array , are proposed in @xcite .",
    "the nested array consists of two or more ulas with increasing intersensor spacings .",
    "the dof achieved by using an n - element nested array is @xmath2 .",
    "compared with mra and nra , the uniform geometry inside each level of the nested array simplifies the formulation and analysis but sacrifices the dof .",
    "it is desirable to achieve higher dof by inerratic array geometry .    in this paper , real - valued kr approaches are developed for the underdetermined direction - of - arrival ( doa ) estimation problem .",
    "the complexities of subspace decomposition and spectral search are reduced compared with the complex - valued kr approach . by designing a special transformation matrix ,",
    "the influence of the noise is removed in the mean time while the data is transformed from the complex domain to the real domain . unlike using the orthogonal complement projecting @xcite or eliminating entries of the covariance matrix by additional matrix multiplication @xcite , no extra operations are required for eliminating the noise in the proposed real - valued kr approaches . by relocating the origin of coordinate and increasing the sensor spacing of the outer - level ula of pal s nested array , a new nested array geometry is designed .",
    "the real - valued denoising kr approach developed on the new nested array can resolve more sources with reduced computational complexity and increased spectral search efficiency .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the signal model based on the kr product is described in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the real - valued kr approach on the ula is designed . the new nested array geometry and the real - valued kr approach developed on it are presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
