    "<S> by direct numerical simulation and variational solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation , we studied the stationary and dynamic characteristics of a cigar - shaped , localized , collisionally inhomogeneous bose - einstein condensate trapped in a one - dimensional bichromatic quasi - periodic optical - lattice potential , as used in a recent experiment on the localization of a bose - einstein condensate [ roati _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , nature ( london ) * 453 * , 895 ( 2008 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential characterizing the spatially modulated nonlinearity is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the collisional inhomogeneity has influence not only on the central region but also on the tail of the bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the influence depends on the sign and value of the spatially modulated nonlinearity coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the stability of the stationary localized state by performing a standard linear stability analysis . where possible , the numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with the variational results . </S>"
