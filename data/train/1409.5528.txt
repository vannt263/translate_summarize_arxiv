    "this paper is concerned with multidimensional random walks in random environments ( rwre ) in the ballistic regime .",
    "we begin with a definition of the model , followed by a brief motivation and historical account .",
    "we then state our results and give an outline of the remainder of the paper .",
    "let @xmath3 be the simplex of all probability vectors on @xmath4 .",
    "we call _ environment _ any element @xmath5 of the environment space @xmath6 .",
    "fixed @xmath7 , the random walk in environment @xmath8 starting from @xmath9 is defined as the markov chain @xmath10 in @xmath4 with law @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 for each @xmath14 .",
    "a random environment is specified by choosing a probability measure @xmath15 on the environment space @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath17 are i.i.d .  under @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution @xmath18 is called the _ quenched _ law of the rwre starting from @xmath9 , and @xmath19 its _ averaged _ or",
    "_ annealed _ law .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the corresponding expectations .    given a vector @xmath22",
    ", we say that the rwre is _ transient in direction @xmath23 _ if @xmath24 it is well known that , if is satisfied , it is possible to define _ regeneration times _ @xmath25 that satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "these were first introduced by sznitman and zerner in @xcite , where their construction is detailed .",
    "another important type of hypotheses for the model are ellipticity assumptions .",
    "these are conditions on the positivity of @xmath27 for some collection of sites @xmath28 .",
    "for example , the environment is called _ elliptic _ if there exists a basis @xmath29 of @xmath4 such that @xmath30 a.s .  for all @xmath31 , and",
    "_ uniformly elliptic _ if there exists some @xmath32 such that @xmath33 a.s .  for all @xmath34 .",
    "milder conditions are also used in the literature ; in this case we call the environment `` weakly elliptic '' .",
    "the model described in section  [ ss : model ] has been the subject of intense study for several decades now . in one dimension ,",
    "it is currently very well understood but , in higher dimensions , important questions remain open despite many accomplishments .",
    "a subclass of models for which several results are available is the so - called _",
    "ballistic regime_. in this case , not only is the rwre transient as in but moves linearly with time in direction @xmath23 , often satisfying some prescribed deviation bounds .",
    "one way to obtain such bounds is to require finite moments for the regeneration time . indeed , for @xmath35 , under and supposing @xmath36",
    "< \\infty $ ] , the rwre satisfies a law of large numbers with a non - degenerate velocity ( see sznitman and zerner @xcite and zerner @xcite ) while , if @xmath37 < \\infty$ ] , it also satisfies a functional central limit theorem ( fclt ) under the annealed law ( see sznitman @xcite ) .    under stricter conditions ,",
    "one is able to prove also a fclt under the quenched law .",
    "this has been proved for example by rassoul - agha and sepplinen in @xcite under weak ellipticity and @xmath38 < \\infty$ ] , and by berger and zeitouni in @xcite under uniform ellipticity and @xmath39 < \\infty$ ] .",
    "the aim of this article is to improve the moment assumptions on @xmath40 under an additional restriction : the ballisticity condition @xmath41 , first introduced by sznitman in @xcite .",
    "it is then enough to require @xmath42 < + \\infty $ ] with @xmath43 .",
    "this result offers no improvement in the uniformly elliptic case since then condition @xmath41 is known to imply finite moments of all orders for @xmath40 .",
    "however , without uniform ellipticity the latter implication might not true , and our extension can considerably improve the range of validity of the quenched fclt .",
    "this is the case for example when the random environment has a product dirichlet distribution , as discussed in section  [ sec : dirichlet ] below .      in the following , we assume the existence of @xmath44 such that the random walk in random environment satisfies ( [ e : transience ] )",
    ". we will also assume the following conditions :    1 .",
    "* condition @xmath45 . *",
    "the walk has bounded steps : there exists a finite , deterministic and positive constant @xmath46 such that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "2 .   * condition @xmath49 .",
    "* the set @xmath50 of admissible steps under @xmath15 satisfies @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath53 .",
    "conditions @xmath45 and @xmath49 are exactly as stated in the article @xcite of rassoul - agha and sepplinen .",
    "they hold for example in the case of nearest - neighbour random walks in elliptic random environments , such as dirichlet random environments .",
    "transience , @xmath45 , @xmath49 and @xmath36 < + \\infty $ ] are enough to imply a strong law of large numbers with a velocity @xmath54 ( see sznitman and zerner @xcite and zerner @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath55 define now a sequence of processes @xmath56 by setting @xmath57}-[nt]v}{\\sqrt{n } } , \\;\\ ; t \\ge 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 : = \\max \\ { n \\in { \\mathbb{z } } : n \\leq x \\}$ ] stands for the integer part of @xmath9 .",
    "if in addition @xmath59 < + \\infty $ ] , then @xmath60 converges under the annealed law to a brownian motion with a non - degenerate covariance matrix ( see sznitman @xcite ) .",

    "the walk is transient in direction @xmath62 and there exists @xmath63 such that @xmath64 < \\infty .\\ ] ]    all concrete examples where an annealed fclt has been proved so far satisfy condition @xmath41 .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ theo : quenchedfclt ] set @xmath65 .",
    "we consider a random walk in an i.i.d .  random environment .",
    "assume that there is a direction @xmath66 where the transience condition ( [ e : transience ] ) holds , and denote by @xmath40 the corresponding regeneration time .",
    "suppose that the walk satisfies conditions @xmath45 , @xmath49 and @xmath67 for some @xmath61 .",
    "also suppose that @xmath42 < + \\infty $ ] for some @xmath68 .",
    "then , for @xmath15-a.e .  environment @xmath8 , the process @xmath69 converges in law ( as @xmath70 ) under @xmath71 to a brownian motion with a deterministic , non - degenerate covariance matrix .",
    "note that under a rather weak integrability condition on the environment at one site , denoted @xmath72 , campos and ramirez proved in the non - uniformly elliptic case that the @xmath0 conditions are all equivalent to a weaker polynomial condition @xmath73 , cf @xcite for a precise result ( in the uniformly elliptic case , this is a result of berger , drewitz and ramrez , @xcite ) .",
    "the polynomial condition is not stated in the same terms as in formula ( [ condition - t ] ) , but in terms of exit probabilities of boxes .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown to be equivalent to an integrability condition on some polynomial moments of @xmath74 .",
    "with respect to the quenched clt , theorem 1.1 of @xcite tells us that if condition @xmath72 and condition @xmath73 are satisfied for @xmath75 ( cf @xcite for the definition ) , then condition @xmath76 holds , reducing the condition of theorem [ theo : quenchedfclt ] to @xmath42 < + \\infty $ ] for some @xmath77 .",
    "note also that sufficient conditions for the integrability of moments @xmath78 $ ] have been given in two papers , by bouchet , ramrez , sabot in @xcite and fribergh , kious in @xcite .",
    "these conditions involve the environment at one site or in a small box .",
    "we believe that condition @xmath41 in theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] above can be replaced by the condition @xmath79 < \\infty \\ ; \\text { for some } \\ , p \\text { large enough ( depending on $ d$)}\\ ] ] and a more restrictive moment condition on the renewal times .",
    "but in fact , as explained above , under a rather weak ellipticity condition , the condition above is equivalent to the condition @xmath41 , cf theorem 1.1 in @xcite .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] is based on strategies and techniques used by berger and zeitouni in @xcite , and by rassoul - agha and sepplinen in @xcite .",
    "the key differences compared to @xcite and @xcite are in the following two steps :    * we improve the key estimate of section 4 of @xcite by means of condition @xmath41 . * the construction of the joint regeneration times of section 7 of @xcite is modified so that condition @xmath41 can be used to get better estimates on the number of intersections .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dirichlet ] , we discuss dirichlet random environments , which are examples where theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] significantly improves previously known results .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] is given in section  [ s : proof_theo_qfclt ] conditionally on two auxiliary theorems .",
    "the first auxiliary theorem reduces the problem to bounding the expected number of intersections of two independent copies of the rwre in the same random environment , while the second provides the required bound .",
    "their proofs are given in sections  [ sec : boundbyintersec ] and [ sec : boundonintersections ] and are based on section 4 of @xcite and section 7 of @xcite , respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider a particular case for which our theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] significantly increases the understanding of the behavior : the case of random walks in dirichlet random environments .",
    "this case is particularly interesting because it offers analytical simplifications , and because it is linked with reinforced random walks .",
    "indeed , the annealed law of a random walk in dirichlet environment corresponds exactly to the law of a linearly directed - edge reinforced random walk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a nearest neighbor walk on @xmath4 , @xmath80 , and we note @xmath81 the canonical vectors with the convention @xmath82 for @xmath83",
    ".    given a set of positive real weights @xmath84 , a random i.i.d .",

    "@xmath90 stands for the usual gamma function @xmath91 , and @xmath92 represents the image of the lebesgue measure on @xmath93 by the application @xmath94 .",
    "it is straightforward that the law does not depend on the specific role of @xmath95 .",
    "note that dirichlet environments are not uniformly elliptic : we can find no positive @xmath96 such that @xmath97",
    ".    set a dirichlet law with fixed parameters @xmath98 .",
    "theorem 1 of @xcite ( see also remark  3 and section  1.3.2 therein ) gives us that , if we assume @xmath41 with @xmath61 , then @xmath99 < + \\infty $ ] is satisfied whenever @xmath100 on the other hand , condition @xmath41 is satisfied for all @xmath61 whenever @xmath101 indeed , it was shown by tournier in @xcite ( see also enriquez and sabot @xcite ) that implies kalikow s condition , which is in turn known to imply condition @xmath102 ; see remark 2.5 ( ii ) in @xcite .",
    "the complete characterization of @xmath41 in terms of the parameters of the dirichlet law remains an open question , but we believe condition @xmath41 should be satisfied if and only if @xmath103 , i.e. , we expect the hypotheses of theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] to hold as soon as @xmath104 and the walk is non - symmetric .",
    "theorem  [ theo : quenchedfclt ] thus gives us a quenched functional central limit theorem for dirichlet environments as soon as the walk is transient , @xmath104 and holds .",
    "this is a real improvement compared to the results of @xcite ( that do not apply as the dirichlet environment is not uniformly elliptic ) or @xcite ( that required @xmath105 ) .",
    "also note that , in dimension @xmath106 , @xmath107 implies the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure for the environment viewed from the particle ( see sabot @xcite ) , which gives directly @xmath36 < + \\infty $ ] in the non - symmetric case .",
