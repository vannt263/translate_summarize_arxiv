    "nonclassical character of photon - number statistics occurs mostly at single - photon level . for this reason , we assume a regime in which the waveguide is pumped by a strong forward - propagating pump field and classical strong amplitude mean - values @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 are zero .",

    "suitable values of pump amplitude @xmath121 for sub - poissonian - light generation depend on length @xmath123 of the waveguide .",
    "the longer the waveguide , the smaller the suitable values of pump amplitude @xmath121 . a photonic band - gap structure with @xmath135 ( also @xmath181 is assumed ) inside the waveguide in this case leads to a redistribution of energy in the pump modes in the way that enables again sub - poissonian - light generation in mode ( @xmath115 ) . for a given value of length @xmath123 and a given sufficiently great value of @xmath182 there is an optimum value of @xmath21 for which the value of fano factor @xmath156 reaches a minimum value that is obtained also in the waveguide without a photonic band - gap structure ( @xmath183 , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . if the value of pump amplitude @xmath121 is small , the greater the @xmath21 the greater the fano factor @xmath156 ; i.e. a photonic band - gap structure does not support sub - poissonian - light generation in this case .",
    "nonzero values of linear phase mismatch @xmath124 in this otherwise phase - matched interaction result in greater values of fano factor @xmath156 .    in order to obtain sub - poissonian light in mode ( @xmath115 ) , the nonlinear interaction has to be stimulated , i.e. the incident small amplitudes @xmath184 and @xmath185 have to be nonzero .",
    "moreover , values of amplitudes @xmath184 and @xmath186 have to be nearly the same and their phases have to fulfill the condition @xmath187 . under these conditions",
    "fano factor @xmath156 of mode ( @xmath131 ) decreases with increasing values of amplitudes @xmath188 and @xmath185 . for a certain value of these amplitudes a minimum value of fano factor @xmath156",

    "if the nonlinear interaction is not phase - matched ( @xmath189 ) in the waveguide with no photonic band - gap structure ( @xmath180 ) sub - poissonian light in mode ( @xmath115 ) can still be obtained but greater values of fano factor @xmath156 occur .",
    "even values of fano factor @xmath156 can monotonically increase as the value of pump amplitude @xmath121 increases in some cases .",
    "then values of parameters of the photonic band - gap structure ( @xmath135 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) can be set in such a way that the original low values of fano factor @xmath156 are restored . if we consider @xmath192 mm@xmath130 under the conditions specified in caption to fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the lowest value of fano factor @xmath156 is approximately 0.8 .",
    "a suitable choice of values of @xmath21 and @xmath193 provides the original value of fano factor @xmath156 being roughly 0.3 , as is documented in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "according to our investigations , the region in @xmath194 space for which the influence of nonlinear phase mismatch @xmath128 is compensated lies around @xmath195 and also greater values of @xmath21 are needed . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the region where @xmath124 is greater than @xmath196 is not suitable for the generation of sub - poissonian light .",
    "a suitable choice of the incident phase @xmath197 of the forward - propagating pump mode [ @xmath198 can be used as a final step to reach the lowest possible value of fano factor @xmath156 that is allowed by a given set of values of waveguide parameters .",
    "we have observed a strong dependence of values of fano factor @xmath156 on the value of phase @xmath199",
    ".    low values of fano factor @xmath156 are usually reached when also integrated intensity @xmath200 of a given mode has low values .",
    "we now consider the influence of photonic band - gap structure in its full complexity , i.e. also the signal and idler fields are linearly scattered ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) . under phase - matched conditions increasing values of @xmath19 and @xmath139",
    "destroy sub - poissonian photon - number statistics in mode ( @xmath201 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , they support sub - poissonian - light generation in modes ( @xmath116 ) and ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "mode ( @xmath117 ) can have values of fano factor @xmath156 less than one only for small values of @xmath19 and also a nonzero value of @xmath139 is required . in general , oscillating regime of behavior of field amplitudes ( @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath125 ) is more convenient for sub - poisonian - light generation .",
    "values of fano factors @xmath156 in general depend only on the phase @xmath204 [ @xmath149 ] that combines phases of all linear coupling constants . the lowest value of fano factor @xmath156 in mode ( @xmath116 )",
    "is reached for @xmath206 ; @xmath207 has been found to be optimum for mode ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we note that a qualitative similarity can be found in the behavior of photon - number statistics between the investigated waveguide and that one composed of two separated nonlinear parts with co - propagating fields @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear waveguide can also be used for improving signal - to - noise ratio of an incident field .",
    "this effect can be explained claiming that the signal part and the noisy part of the incident field have different amplification coefficients in the nonlinear process .",
    "an average amplification coefficient of a field in a nonlinear process depends on a statistical distribution of incident - field phases ; there exists one phase for which the amplification is maximum .",
    "if the central phase of the incident field ( corresponding to a coherent signal amplitude ) has the strongest amplification then the noisy part ( with a blurred phase distribution ) is less amplified on average and signal - to - noise ratio increases .",
    "similarly as for sub - poissonian - light generation , the best conditions for the reduction of noise - to - signal ratio can be found in a phase - matched waveguide without a photonic band - gap structure .",
    "if nonlinear phase - matching can not be reached , a suitable photonic band - gap structure inside the waveguide compensates for nonlinear phase - mismatch and gives similar conditions for the reduction of noise - to - signal ratio as those found in the perfectly phase - matched waveguide . for a given value of nonlinear phase mismatch @xmath128 ( @xmath208 ) , there are regions in space @xmath209 where the optimum conditions for the reduction of noise - to - signal ratio are found .",
    "these regions lie around the line @xmath210 and also values of @xmath21 have to be greater . second reduced moment of integrated intensity @xmath211 [ @xmath212 for mode @xmath13 having incident @xmath213 ( 100 incident signal photons , 100 incident noisy photons ) is plotted in fig . [ fig11 ] assuming @xmath214 mm@xmath215 .",
    "regions suitable for the reduction of noise - to - signal ratio are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ; the lowest achieved value of @xmath211 is 1.36 .",
    "capability to reduce noise - to - signal ratio increases with the increasing forward - propagating pump amplitude @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "this monotonous behavior clearly shows that the nonlinear interaction is responsible for this effect .",
    "the strength of the effect also depends on the amount of incident noise . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for mode @xmath13 , an optimum value of the number of incident noisy photons exists for which the reduction of noise - to - signal ratio is the best .",
    "a planar nonlinear photonic band - gap waveguide with optical parametric process has been analyzed from the point of view of generation of squeezed light and light with sub - poissonian photon - number statistics . it has been shown that squeezed light as well as sub - poissonian light can be generated in compound modes composed of one signal and one idler field ; both forward- and backward - propagating fields can be successfully combined",
    ". the waveguide with a photonic band - gap structure can not provide better values of principal squeeze variance and fano factor in comparison with the waveguide with no photonic band - gap structure and having the nonlinear interaction phase - matched .",
    "however , if the nonlinear interaction in a waveguide can not be phase - matched for some reason , inclusion of a photonic band - gap structure such as to compensate for phase mismatch leads to values of principal squeeze variances and fano factors that are found assuming perfect phase - matching .",
    "this property makes nonlinear photonic band - gap waveguides promising as sources of light with nonclassical properties .",
    "moreover , if a noisy light is incident on the waveguide its signal - to - noise ratio can be improved as the light propagates in the waveguide .",
