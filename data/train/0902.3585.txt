    "thermonuclear fusion requires plasmas with a pressure of at least an atmosphere , and temperatures in excess of 100 million degrees kelvin .",
    "these conditions can be achieved in tokamaks such as jet@xcite , but the plasmas are subject to a number of instabilities , the consequences of which range from benign to structurally damaging . by understanding the instabilities that can occur ,",
    "they can be avoided or mitigated .",
    "a class of instabilities that are only partly understood are edge localised modes ( elms)@xcite .",
    "elms can lead to a rapid deposition of energy onto plasma facing components , and this is a potentially serious issue for proposed large tokamak devices such as iter@xcite .",
    "our present understanding of elms is based on the linear ideal magnetohydrodynamic peeling - ballooning instability ( wilson et al @xcite , gimblett et al@xcite ) , which is thought to trigger elms , that subsequently evolve non - linearly .",
    "the studies upon which this understanding were based considered tokamak equilibria with a smoothly shaped magnetic flux - surface at the plasma - vacuum boundary . in contrast , modern tokamak plasmas have a cross - section in which the outermost flux surface is redirected onto divertor plates , forming a separatrix with a sharp `` x - point '' where the magnetic topology changes from closed ( confined plasma ) , to open field lines along which plasma can flow to the divertor plates@xcite .",
    "the first numerical evidence for a stabilising effect from the separatrix was found by medvedev et al@xcite .",
    "more recently , numerical studies of the peeling - ballooning instability in these x - point plasmas ( huysmans@xcite ) , have found that as the plasma s outermost flux surface is made increasingly close to that of a separatrix with an x - point , the peeling mode becomes stabilised .",
    "crucially the stabilisation appeared to happen before the plasma formed a separatrix with an x - point , shaping alone appeared to be sufficient to stabilise the mode .",
    "this appears to be contrary to theoretical work by laval et al@xcite , which has indicated that the peeling mode is unstable in cylindrical plasmas with an arbitrarily shaped cross - section .",
    "in addition the elite code ( wilson et al@xcite ) has recently been used to examine peeling mode stability as the outermost flux surface approaches the separatrix .",
    "it was found that although the growth rate reduced in size as the boundary more closely approximated a separatrix , it did so increasingly slowly , and its asymptotic behaviour was uncertain ( saarelma@xcite ) . to help understand and reconcile these results , here in the first part of this two part paper we re - examine the assumptions made in the derivation of the peeling mode stability criterion for a cylinder , and generalise the calculation so that it applies to a toroidal tokamak plasma .    as with the original studies of the peeling mode in a cylinder , for simplicity we will firstly consider marginal stability , and generalise the condition for peeling mode stability in a straight cylinder to a condition for peeling mode stability in an arbitrary cross - section tokamak plasma .",
    "the resulting equations only describe peeling mode stability , and are not complicated by coupling to the ballooning mode instability , for example .",
    "this paper generalises previous analytic calculations in a number of ways .",
    "firstly it applies to axisymmetric toroidal geometries , as opposed to the cylindrical geometry in which the peeling mode has been extensively studied ( for example see laval et al@xcite , lortz@xcite , connor et al@xcite ) .",
    "it allows for equilibrium poloidal currents at the plasma edge , in addition to the toroidal current that is solely included in previous analytic studies .",
    "the skin currents that are induced by a plasma perturbation are related to the difference between the magnetic field in the plasma and the vacuum , and it is found that at marginal stability a plasma perturbation induces a skin current that is parallel and proportional to the equilibrium edge current and proportional to the amplitude of the radial plasma displacement .",
    "the complicated - looking plasma - vacuum boundary condition that is usually found in association with the energy principle may be expressed as a simple relationship between the normal components of the plasma and vacuum magnetic fields .",
    "this is used to relate the generalised equations for peeling mode stability at marginal stability to the energy principle , and this allows us to define the peeling mode in terms of the energy principle s @xmath1 . with this energy principle for the peeling mode we can consider the trial function used by laval et al@xcite , finding that a single parameter @xmath0 determines the sign and magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "finally the instability s growth rate is considered .",
    "laval et al@xcite considered a large aspect ratio ordering that neglects toroidal effects , and also neglects any equilibrium poloidal current at the plasma edge .",
    "the work suggests that the peeling mode will be unstable for a non - zero edge current , regardless of the plasma cross section .",
    "later we will reconsider peeling mode stability for arbitrary cross section tokamak plasmas , but firstly we consider some properties of the trial function considered by laval et al@xcite .    note that for an element of length @xmath2 along a flux surface in the poloidal plane , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the jacobian , @xmath5 the poloidal field , @xmath6 is the local field - line pitch , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 an orthogonal toroidal co - ordinate system ( for example , see freidberg@xcite for details ) . thus the poloidal angle used in laval et al",
    ", @xmath10 is the same as the usual straight field line angle@xcite , and @xmath11 .",
    "the perturbation they consider has a plasma displacement @xmath12 , so if we plot @xmath13 versus the length along a flux surface in the poloidal plane , then near the separatrix in an x - point equilibrium @xmath13 will oscillate arbitrarily rapidly as we approach the x - point ( see figure [ xiofchi ] ) .",
    "the most unstable modes have @xmath14 , so in the figure we plot a mode with @xmath14 , for which @xmath15 .",
    "alternately , when @xmath16 or @xmath17 , then the mode localises poloidally in the vicinity of the x - point , and is approximately constant elsewhere .",
    "the rapid oscillation of @xmath13 near the x - point makes it questionable whether it is physically acceptable , and other terms beyond ideal mhd need to be considered , but it certainly means that the closer we approach the separatrix the greater the number of fourier modes required ( since @xmath14 ) , and the smaller a computer code s mesh spacing would need to be to represent the mode .",
    "therefore as we approach the separatrix it will be increasingly difficult for a numerical calculation to represent the mode .",
    "here we outline the derivation of the marginal stability condition for an arbitrarily large aspect ratio ( cylindrical ) equilibrium with the tokamak ordering ( freidberg@xcite , wesson@xcite ) .",
    "we start from the usual force balance equation @xmath18 , and take the curl of both sides , expanding to give , @xmath19 linearising the equation then gives for the equilibrium quantities @xmath20 and for the perturbed quantities @xmath21 because eq . [ 00 ] holds everywhere , with @xmath22 having the constant value of zero , the last term in eq .",
    "[ linearised ] that arises from the displacement of the plasma surface by @xmath13 , is zero . in the large aspect ratio approximation ( freidberg@xcite , wesson@xcite ) ,",
    "[ linearised ] further simplifies to @xmath23    again , in the large aspect ratio ( cylindrical ) approximation we may write @xmath24 , for which @xmath25 with this same ordering ( freidberg@xcite , wesson@xcite ) , @xmath26 is taken to be parallel to @xmath27 .",

    "the perturbed field from @xmath47 may be discontinuous however .",
    "also @xmath48 just inside the plasma , but @xmath49 in the vacuum outside the plasma , so if we integrate from an arbitrarily small distance inside the plasma surface to an arbitrarily small distance outside the surface , we get @xmath50 - \\frac{im}{r }   \\tilde{\\psi}_m \\left[\\left| j_{0\\phi }   \\right|\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath51 $ ] indicates the _ difference _ between @xmath52 evaluated in the vacuum just outside of the plasma , and @xmath52 evaluated just inside the plasma ( @xmath53 $ ] _ does not _ equal the integral of @xmath52 from just inside to just outside the plasma ) .",
    "writing @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then gives @xmath56 } {    \\tilde{\\psi}_m } + \\frac{r j_a}{b_p}\\ ] ] as the condition for marginal stability .",
    "here we re - examine the assumptions made in going from eq .",
    "[ eleven ] to eq . [ twelve ] . to obtain eq .",
    "[ twelve ] , we allowed the perturbed fields to be discontinuous , but required the equilibrium fields to be continuous across the plasma - vacuum boundary .",
    "because a discontinuous magnetic field requires a skin current@xcite , we will allow perturbed skin currents , but the continuous equilibrium fields imply zero equilibrium skin currents .",
    "therefore we assume that : ( a ) there are no equilibrium skin currents , but @xmath26 can be discontinuous at the plasma - vacuum interface , and ( b ) perturbations to the magnetic field induce surface skin currents .",
    "the first of these assumptions means that with the exception of @xmath26 , the equilibrium quantities will be continuous across the plasma - vacuum boundary .",
    "so if we integrate along the unit normal to the plasma surface , from a distance @xmath57 just inside the surface to a distance @xmath57 just outside the plasma , then we will get @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a path parameterised by @xmath60 , that is parallel to the unit normal to the plasma , and where @xmath52 is a continuous equlibrium quantity .",
    "we also get @xmath61 however , because the equlibrium current is discontinuous at the plasma surface being non - zero within the surface but zero in the vacuum , its derivatives act like delta functions , and hence @xmath62\\ ] ] and similarly @xmath63\\ ] ] the second of these assumptions , that the perturbation will produce skin currents at the plasma surface ( i.e. that the perturbed magnetic field can be discontinuous at the perturbed plasma surface ) , means that for a perturbed current @xmath29 @xmath64 i.e. the skin current acts like a delta function at the plasma surface . the reason for including the factor of @xmath65 will be clear later .",
    "similarly if @xmath52 is a continuous function at the plasma surface , @xmath66    a few other remarks are worthwhile .",
    "firstly the terms in eq .",

    "for example if our trial function @xmath237 had been @xmath238 so that it had dimensions of length as opposed to dimensions of length times @xmath150 , then we would no longer have @xmath239 , despite our model only depending on the poloidal structure of the mode .",

    "the growth rate is discussed later .    are there any reasons why a computer code might fail to find an unstable mode ?",
    "one possibility is that the need for @xmath240 will require very high poloidal mode numbers as @xmath241 , and this could potentially prevent a numerical code from seeing the instability . also important , is the need to consider the most unstable mode .",

    "the second part to this paper calculates @xmath0 analytically , thereby avoiding the numerical problems associated with an x - point .",
    "another , less obvious reason why an unstable mode might not be found in computer calculations is that despite @xmath249 indicating that it is energetically favourable for the mode to be unstable , the growth rate can still be vanishingly small .",

    "finally we considered the growth rate , and found that even with @xmath325 , the growth rate can be vanishingly small .",
