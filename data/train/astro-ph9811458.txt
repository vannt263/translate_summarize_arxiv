    "gravitational lensing remains a rapidly evolving field of study , with observational evidence now firmly established for the phenomena of strong , weak , and micro - lensing .",
    "examples include multiple imaging of background quasars by foreground galaxies , weak distortion of background galaxy images by foreground galaxy clusters , and time - dependent enhancement of stellar brightness by underluminous objects in our own galaxy .",
    "in each of these cases , the intervening matter between the source and observer acts as a converging lens , leading to image splitting , magnification , and distortion . in addition to mass concentrations , _ underdensities",
    "_ in the matter distribution ",
    "voids  also affect the propagation of light rays across cosmological distances . over the last fifteen years",
    ", galaxy redshift surveys have revealed that a substantial fraction of the volume of the universe is occupied by giant voids , quasi - spherical regions almost empty of luminous matter ( e.g. , de lapparent _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , el - ad _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , da costa _ et al . _",
    "however , relatively little attention has been devoted to the possibility of detecting the gravitational lensing effects of voids .",
    "a light ray passing through an empty region is deflected away from the center of the void , since it is gravitationally attracted by the surrounding matter .",
    "this phenomenon is mentioned , although not discussed , in hammer & nottale ( 1986 ) , in connection with a cluster model with a surrounding underdense shell .",
    "it is also discussed in the linear limit by moreno & portilla ( 1990 ) , but they do not draw observational conclusions .",
    "the effects of large empty regions on light propagation in frw universes has been extensively studied ( e.g. , dyer & roeder 1972 ; see holz & wald 1998 for a recent discussion ) , but these works did not focus on the detectability of individual voids via lensing .",
    "in this paper we study gravitational lensing by large - scale voids and the possibility of its detection .",
    "our motivations are several : first , voids are ubiquitous and large , accounting for some 80% of the volume of the universe .",
    "it is in fact rather unlikely for a light ray from a distant source _ not _ to have passed through a void .",
    "second , to understand the formation of such large voids we would like to know their matter content : are they nearly devoid of matter or only lacking bright galaxies ? in principle , gravitational lensing can probe the matter content of voids .",
    "third , some theories predict the formation of _ primordial voids _",
    ", e.g. , due to cosmic explosions ( ostriker & cowie 1981 ; yoshioka & ikeuchi 1989 ) or primordial phase transitions ( la 1991 ; amendola & occhionero 1993 ; amendola _ et al .",
    "a search for such primordial structures could be pursued via their gravitational lensing signature .",
    "fourth ,  negative \" masses , i.e. , underdense regions , lead to new lensing phenomena that are of intrinsic theoretical interest .",
    "thus , we pose the following question : suppose a void of scale @xmath1 at redshift @xmath2 is identified in a galaxy redshift survey ; can its lensing effect on background sources be measured and use to probe its matter density ? since this is an exploratory study",
    ", we consider a highly idealized model of a void , comprising a uniform spherical underdensity surrounded by a uniform overdense shell , in an otherwise homogenous universe . while only a starting point for a more realistic treatment , such a model captures the broad features found in numerical and analytical studies of voids growing via gravitational instability .",
    "we consider two techniques for detecting the lensing effect of voids , color - dependent angular density amplification ( broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1995 , broadhurst 1996 ) and aperture densitometry ( kaiser 1994 , schneider 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we find that only voids with radii larger than 100 can be individually detected via weak lensing ; empty voids with radii @xmath3 , characteristic of those seen in galaxy redshift surveys , have a lensing signal - to - noise ratio smaller than unity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "here we review the basic features of gravitational lens theory and apply it to lensing by spherical voids .",
    "the lensing geometry in the case of voids is shown in figure 1 . in the figure , l is the center of the void , s is a distant point source , and o the observer .",
    "the source is at distance @xmath8 from the observer and @xmath9 from the lens , and the distance between lens and observer is denoted by @xmath10 ; these are angular diameter distances .",
    "light rays from the source are ` repelled ' by the lens center and are deflected by the angle @xmath11 ( the deflection angle is negative for a matter underdensity ) .",
    "the angular separations between lens and image and between lens and source are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that a void can be thought of as an `` extended negative mass lens '' and some of its lensing properties can be obtained from that of a `` negative point mass lens '' in exactly the same way as the standard point mass lens is generalized to an extended lens ( see , e.g. , schneider , ehlers and falco ( 1992 ) ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the `` thin lens '' approximation , applicable if the void radius @xmath1 is small compared with @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "now consider photons traveling in a weak gravitational field generated by a stationary bound system .",

    "since @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 at infinity , from poisson s equation we find @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the surface mass density , and the critical surface density @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 defining the convergence , @xmath33 , it follows from eqn.(6 ) that @xmath34    the shear is defined by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 from eqn.(4 ) , the jacobian matrix of the lensing mapping , which describes its local properties , can be expressed as @xmath38 since lensing conserves surface brightness , the image magnification @xmath39 is given by the increase in image area due to convergence and shear , @xmath40    we now apply this formalism to the spherical void lens .",
    "we model the void as a spherically symmetric matter distribution , with density excess @xmath41 given by @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the density contrast ( @xmath44 ) , and @xmath45 is the mean energy density of the universe . in eqn.(11 ) , @xmath1 is the void radius , and @xmath46 is the thickness of the surrounding mass shell .",

    "the source galaxies were all placed at the same redshift , and the distortion has been exaggerated to show the effect .",
    "since lensing changes the apparent brightness of a source , the galaxy number count vs. magnitude relation will be altered for sources behind a foreground lens ; this effect has been proposed as a method for probing cluster masses ( broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1994 , broadhurst 1996 , van kampen 1998 ) .",
    "weak lensing causes two opposing effects on the number density of background sources to fixed limiting magnitude .",
    "compared to an unlensed sample , sources behind a void are demagnified by a factor @xmath86 , resulting in fewer sources in a magnitude - limited survey . on the other hand",
    ", the radial deflection of light rays by the foreground void causes the background images to appear concentrated toward the line of sight to the lens , increasing their areal density by a factor @xmath100 . for galaxies observed in the red , the latter effect dominates , leading to an enhancement in the number density of galaxies behind a void ; for lensing by clusters , one expects a suppression of red background source counts .",

    "in fact this appears to be a good approximation up to @xmath116 . for deeper surveys ,",
    "the effective value of @xmath114 is larger and the effect we are estimating weaker . as will be clear from our results , even using this somewhat optimistic approximation",
    ", it is very difficult to obtain a high signal to noise ratio with this technique for voids .",
    "let us estimate the fractional variation @xmath117 in the number count of red galaxies behind a void and compare it with various sources of noise .",
    "we assume that the unlensed redshift distribution of the sources in the sample is given by the normalized function @xmath118 , which we will specify below .",
    "in the weak lensing limit , the magnification @xmath119 ; therefore , for objects at fixed angular separation @xmath120 from the lens center at @xmath2 @xmath121    there are four main sources of statistical error in this measurement : the variance @xmath122 due to lensing by random density fluctuations along the line of sight , the poisson noise @xmath123 due to the finite number of sources , the variance @xmath124 due to angular clustering of the source galaxies , and errors in the limiting apparent magnitude due to experimental errors and to uncertainties in the extinction / reddening correction .",
    "let us start with the latter error in @xmath125 .",
    "if the galaxy counts scale as @xmath126 with @xmath127 , then it is easy to show that the error in the number counts from an error in @xmath128 is smaller than the poisson fluctuation only if @xmath129 .",

    "clearly , the poisson and clustering contributions _ decrease _ with increasing depth of the sample , because the number of sources grows and the angular correlation function falls ; by contrast , the lensing variance @xmath152 _ increases _ with sample depth , because the number of lenses increases .",

    "we have studied two methods for detecting weak lensing by large - scale voids in the matter distribution , color - dependent density magnification and aperture densitometry .",
    "we have found that only voids larger than @xmath252 100 have a chance of being observed via lensing . in both cases ,",
    "the limiting factor is clustering : for density magnification , the problem is angular clustering of the background sources ; for aperture densitometry , the limit is set by lensing due to other clustered mass along the line of sight .",
    "we note that the model studied here is highly idealized .",
    "in particular , we have assumed that a single void lens dominates the distortion and amplification along the line of sight , while typical light rays from high - redshift sources will in fact traverse a number of voids . on the other hand ,",
    "if voids are ubiquitous , their mean cumulative effects should be described by the large - scale power spectrum , which we have taken into account via the cosmic variance noise .",
    "our study therefore should be considered as applying to the detectability of individual , relatively rare , large , nearly empty voids embedded in a matter distribution otherwise described by a cdm - like power spectrum .",
    "the existence of such large voids in the galaxy distribution is a question that should be addressed by the next generation of large redshift surveys , including the sloan digital sky survey and the two degree field survey .",
