    "microlensing is one of the most powerful methods that can be used to search for extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "recently , two robust microlensing detections of exoplanets were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the signal of a planetary companion to microlens stars is a short - duration perturbation to the smooth standard light curve of the primary - induced lensing event occurring on a background source star .",
    "the planetary perturbation occurs when the source star passes close to the caustic .",
    "the caustic represents the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "studies of the properties of the caustic are important because the characteristics of the planetary perturbations in the microlensing light curve depend critically on the properties of the caustic .",
    "for example , the location of the perturbation on the lensing light curve depends on the location of the caustic .",
    "the duration of the perturbation and the probability of detecting the perturbation are proportional to the caustic size .",
    "in addition , the pattern of the perturbation is closely related to the caustic shape .",
    "therefore , it is essential to understand the properties of caustics for the interpretation of the planetary lensing signals .",
    "although some of the properties of the caustics in planetary microlensing have been known , our knowledges of them are mostly from scattered information based on numerical approaches .",
    "the problem of the numerical approach is that the dependence of the planetary lensing behavior on the planet parameters of the star - planet separation @xmath0 ( normalized by the einstein ring radius @xmath1 ) and the planet / star mass ratio @xmath2 is not clear .",
    "there have been several attempts to overcome this ambiguity using analytic methods . by treating the planet - induced deviation as a perturbation , @xcite and @xcite derived analytic expressions for the locations of the _ central _ caustic , which is one of the two sets of caustics of the star - planet lens system located close to the primary star .",
    "based on a similar perturbative approach , @xcite provides analytic expressions for the locations of the lensing images .",
    "@xcite derived analytic expressions for the locations of not only the central caustic but also the _ planetary _ caustic , the other set of caustics , which are located away from the central star .",
    "however , there has been no analytic work on the detailed properties of the caustics such as the location , size , and shape , except the very recent work of @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) on the central caustics .",
    "following paper i , we conduct a comprehensive and analytic analysis on the properties of the planetary caustics . under the perturbative approximation ,",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the location , size , and shape of the planetary caustics as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . based on these expressions combined with those for the central caustics derived in paper i",
    ", we compare the similarities and differences between the planetary and central caustics .",
    "we provide an expression for the size ratio between the two types of caustics .",
    "we also derive an expression for the condition of the merging of the two types of caustics .",
    "we finally discuss the validity of the perturbative approximation .",
    "a planetary lensing is described by the formalism of a binary lens with a very low - mass companion .",
    "because of the very small mass ratio , planetary lensing behavior is well described by that of a single lens of the primary star for most of the event duration . however , a short - duration perturbation can occur when the source star passes the region around the caustics , which are important features of binary lensing .",
    "the caustics of binary lensing form a single or multiple closed figures where each of which is composed of concave curves ( fold caustics ) that meet at cusps . for a planetary case ,",
    "there exist two sets of disconnected caustics .",
    "one ` central caustic ' is located close to the host star .",
    "the other ` planetary caustic ' is located away from the host star and its number is one or two depending on whether the planet lies outside ( @xmath3 ) or inside ( @xmath4 ) the einstein ring .",
    "the size of the caustic , which is directly proportional to the planet detection efficiency , is maximized when the planet is located in the ` lensing zone ' , which represents the range of the star - planet separation of @xmath5 .",
    "the planetary caustic is always bigger than the central caustic .",
    "we start from the formula of @xcite for the position of the planetary caustics ( eqs . [ 49 ] and [ 50 ] of his paper ) . keeping up to the first order term",
    ", the formula are expressed as @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a variable and @xmath9^{1/2}. \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] in these expressions , the coordinates are centered at the position on the star - planet axis with a separation vector from the position of the star of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the position vector of the planet from the star normalized by @xmath1 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] ) .",
    "the origin of the coordinates corresponds to the center of the planetary caustic . for the pair of the planets with separations",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath12 , the centers of the caustics are separated from the star by the same distance ( because @xmath13 ) but directed toward opposite directions ( because @xmath14\\neq { \\rm sign } [ { \\bold r}(1/s)]$ ] ) . therefore , the center of the caustic is located on the same and opposite sides of the planet with respect to the position of the star for the planets with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "if one defines the lensing zone as the range of the planetary separation for which the planetary caustic is located within the einstein ring , the exact range of the lensing zone is @xmath15 to the first - order approximation , the size of the planetary caustic is proportional to @xmath16 as shown in equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the deviation of the approximation from the exact value in   4.3 .      in this case , between the two values of @xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) only the one with ` + ' sign is valid because the other one with ` @xmath18 ' sign results in @xmath19 . as a result , there exists only a single set of caustics for planets with @xmath3 as shown in figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "the planetary caustic of the planet with @xmath3 is composed of four cusps , with two of them are located on the @xmath20 axis and the other two are located on the @xmath21 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) .",
    "the positions of the individual cusps , @xmath22 , corresponds to the cases of @xmath23 ( for the two cusps on the @xmath20 axis ) and @xmath24 ( for the other two cusps on the @xmath21 axis ) .",
    "then , the positions of the cusps on the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axes are expressed respectively as @xmath25 @xmath26    if we define the horizontal and vertical widths of the planetary caustic as the separations between the cusps on the individual axes ( see fig .",

    "@xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) is valid only in the following range of @xmath8 @xmath34 for @xmath8 within these ranges , there are two possible values of @xmath17 corresponding to the signs . as a result ,",
    "there exist two sets of caustics for planets with @xmath4 ; one above and the other below the star - planet axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : two ] ) .",
    "each of the caustics for the planet with @xmath4 is composed of three cusps .",
    "one of them is located on the @xmath21 axis but the other two are not located on either of the axes .",
    "the caustic meets the @xmath21 axis at @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 when @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) . among these two positions ,",
    "the former corresponds to the cusp , and thus the location of the on - axis cusp is @xmath37 where the sign ` @xmath38 ' is for the cusps located above and below the star - planet axis , respectively .",
    "if we define the vertical width of the caustic as the separation between the two crossing points at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the width is expressed as @xmath41 where the factor ` 1/2 ' is included into consideration that there exist two planetary caustics for planets with @xmath4 and the expression after the arrow is that evaluated to the first non - vanishing order in @xmath0 in the case of @xmath42 . by defining the center of _ each _ caustic as the midpoint between the two crossing points ( see fig .",

    "then , combined with the possible range in equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) , the values of @xmath8 corresponding to the off - axis cusps are found to be @xmath48 with this value combined with equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , the positions of the off - axis cusps are expressed as @xmath49,\\cr }   \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 . in the limiting case of @xmath42 , equation  ( [ eq16 ] )",
    "is approximated as @xmath51 because @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . by defining the horizontal width as the separation between the two off - axis cusps ,",
    "the width is expressed as @xmath55 once again , the factor ` 1/2 ' is included into consideration that there are two planetary caustics . from equations  ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) ,",
    "the vertical / horizontal width ratio is expressed as @xmath56 in the limiting case of @xmath42 , each caustic shrinks as @xmath57 , c.f .",
    "@xmath58 for planets with @xmath3 , and @xmath59 , c.f .",
    "@xmath32 for planets with @xmath3 .",
    "based on the analytic expressions derived in the previous section , we now investigate how the properties of the planetary caustics such as the location , size , and shape vary depending on @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also compare the properties of the planetary caustics with those of the central caustics .      in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : three ] , we present example planetary caustics of several planetary systems with different @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in the lower panel ,",
    "we present the separation of the caustic from the planet - hosting star as a function of @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : four ] , we also present the variation of the caustic size ( as measured by the horizontal and vertical widths ) and the shape ( as measured by the vertical / horizontal width ratio ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of the planetary caustics found from the figures and the dependence of these properties on the planet parameters are as follows .    1 .   for @xmath3 ,",
    "the location of the caustic center depends on @xmath0 but not on @xmath2 . on the other hand , for planets with @xmath4 ,",
    "the caustic location depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in this case , the caustic is located farther away from the star - planet axis as @xmath2 increases ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq14 ] ] ) .",
    "2 .   although the caustic size depends on the mass ratio as @xmath60 , the shape of the caustic does not depend on @xmath2 and solely dependent on @xmath0 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq10 ] ] and [ [ eq19 ] ] ) .",
    "3 .   the rate of decrease of the caustic size with the increase of @xmath61 are different for planets with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . compared to the caustic of the planet with @xmath3 ,",
    "the rate of decrease is steeper for the planet with @xmath4 . in the limiting cases of @xmath29 and @xmath42 , the caustic sizes decrease as @xmath58 and @xmath62 for planets with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( see eqs .  [ [ eq8 ] ] , [ [ eq9 ] ] , [ [ eq13 ] ] , and [ [ eq18 ] ] ) .",
    "@xcite presented the analytic expressions for the location , cusp positions , width , and shape of the central caustics analogous to those presented in the previous section for the planetary caustics .",
    "the expressions for the location of the central caustic , analogous to equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for the planetary caustic , are @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a variable and the coordinates are centered at the position of the host star .",
    "there exists a single central caustic regardless of @xmath0 and it has an elongated asteroid shape with four cusps , of which two are located on the @xmath20 axis and the other two are off the axis .",
    "the analytic expressions for the positions of the individual cusps , which are analogous to equations  ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) for the planetary caustic with @xmath3 and to equations  ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) for the planetary caustic with @xmath4 , are @xmath66 , \\label{eq22}\\ ] ] @xmath67 , \\label{eq23}\\ ] ] where @xmath68^{1/2 }   \\}$ ] .",

    "then , the width ratio of the central caustic is @xmath71 which is analogous to those in equations  ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) for the planetary caustics with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . in the limiting cases of @xmath29 and @xmath42 ,",
    "the size of the central caustic decreases respectively as @xmath72    the planetary and central caustics have the following similarities and differences .    1 .",
    "unlike the planetary caustic , the pair of the central caustics with separations @xmath0 and @xmath12 are identical as demonstrated by the fact that the inversion @xmath73 in equations  ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) results in the same expressions .",
    "2 .   while the dependence of the size of the planetary caustic on the planet / star mass ratio is @xmath60 , the dependence of the central caustic is @xmath74 . therefore , the planetary caustic shrinks much more slowly with the decrease of the planet mass than the central caustic .",
    "3 .   for planets with @xmath3 , the rate of decrease of the size of the central caustic with the increase of @xmath61 is similar to that of the planetary caustic with @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath75 ( see eqs .  [ [ eq8 ] ] and [ [ eq27 ] ] ) , but smaller than that of the planetary caustic with @xmath4 , which shrinks as @xmath57 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq18 ] ] ) .",
    "then , what is the size ratio between the planetary and central caustics .",
    "if we use the horizontal width as a representative quantity for the caustic size , the size ratio between the two types of the caustics is found from equations  ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq18 ] ) , and ( [ eq24 ] ) and expressed as @xmath76 & for $ s<1 $ , \\cr } \\label{eq28}\\ ] ] where the additional subscripts ` p ' and ` c ' denote the planetary and central caustics , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : five ] , we present the size ratio as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath77 while @xmath78 , the dependence of the size ratio on the mass ratio is @xmath79 . for a given mass ratio ,",
    "the size ratio is maximized at around @xmath80 and decreases rapidly with the increase of @xmath61 .",
    ", the change rate of the size ratio is reversed as @xmath61 further increases beyond a critical value ( @xmath81 or @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , this reversal occurs at the separation beyond the lensing zone . ]    as @xmath83 , the location of the planetary caustic , i.e.  @xmath84 , approaches the position of the central star , around which the central caustic is located .",
    "then the two types of the caustics eventually merge together , resulting in gradual loss of distinction between the two types of caustics .",
    "the condition for the merging of the two caustics is that the separation between the two caustics is smaller than the half of the sum of the individual caustic widths , i.e.@xmath85 by using the analytic expressions for @xmath86 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq8 ] ] and [ [ eq18 ] ] ) and @xmath87 ( eq .  [ [ eq24 ] ] ) , we compute the region of the caustic merging in the parameter space of @xmath88 and presented in figure  [ fig : five ] ( the region enclosed by thick dashed lines ) .",
    "the region is confined in a small region around @xmath89 , but the width of the region increases as @xmath2 increases because the caustic size increases with the increase of @xmath2 .      are the presented analytic expressions based on perturbative approximation good enough for the description of the caustics in planetary microlensing ?",
    "we answer this question by comparing the two sets of caustics constructed based on analytic and numerical computations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : six ] , we present some pairs of the planetary caustics with different values of the planet parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in each panel of the figure , the blue caustic is drawn by using the analytic expressions while the red caustic is the exact one based on numerical computations . for reference , we note that the mass ratios of the planets with masses equivalent to the jupiter , saturn , neptune , and earth around a host star with @xmath90 of the most probable galactic lensing event are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , respectively . from the figure",
    ", we find that although the deviation increases with the increase of the planet / star mass ratio , the analytic approximation well describes the planetary caustic in most mass regime of planets ( @xmath9510^{-3}$ ] ) .",
    "for the earth - mass planet , we find that the two caustics are eventually indistinguishable .",
    "we derived analytic expressions for the location , size , and shape of the planetary caustic as a function of the star - planet separation and the planet / star mass ratio under perturbative approximation .",
    "based on these expressions , we conducted comprehensive analysis on the properties of the planetary caustics .",
    "combined with the analogous expressions for the central caustics derived in paper i , we compared the similarities and differences between the planetary and central caustics .",
