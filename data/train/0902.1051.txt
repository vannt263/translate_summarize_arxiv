    "usually , the potential @xmath7 has the minimum at a finite non - zero value of @xmath8 .    global monopole , which arise in some models where a global @xmath9 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath10 , is one of the most interesting defects .",
    "many important properties of global monopole with a canonical kinetic term ( canonical global monopole ) have been well studied ( see , for a review , @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking property of global monopole is that its mass is divergent in flat spacetime .",
    "the gravitational effects of global monopoles were firstly studied by barriola and vilenkin@xcite .",
    "when gravity is considered , the linearly divergent mass of the global monopole has an effect analogous to that of a deficit solid angle plus that of a tiny mass at the origin .",
    "later , harari and loust@xcite , and shi and li@xcite realized that this small gravitational mass is actually negative .",
    "it is shown that the properties of global monopoles in asymptotically de sitter / anti - de sitter(ds / ads ) spacetime @xcite and branes - dicke theory @xcite are very different from those of an ordinary global monopole .    in recent years",
    ", field theories with non - canonical fields were intensively investigated in the cosmological context .",
    "the so - called @xmath11-fields were first introduced in the context of inflation ( dubbed @xmath11-inflation scenario @xcite ) and then @xmath11-essence models were suggested as a candidate to dark energy @xcite .",
    "tachyon matter @xcite and ghost condensation @xcite are other examples of non - canonical fields in cosmology",
    ". symmetry - breaking models of @xmath11-field theory have also been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "general properties of global topological defects appearing in such models were studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the properties of such defects ( dubbed k - defects ) are quite different from `` standard '' global domain walls , vortices and monopoles .",
    "the gravitational property of a kind of global @xmath11-monopole was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a gravitational global @xmath11-monopole can produce a tiny gravitational field outside the core in addition to a solid angular deficit and , as a new feature compared with the canonical global monopole , this gravitational field can be attractive or repulsive depending on the non - canonical kinetic term in the lagrangian .    as a kind of @xmath11-field , dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) field recently attracted much attention .",
    "the main reason is that , in some string theories , the motion of the brane seems to admit an effective good description in terms of a dbi action coupled to gravity @xcite , and it results in a scalar field theory with non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "such a dbi action with higher derivative terms gives a variety of novel cosmological consequences @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the system of a dbi field plus a perfect fluid was investigated @xcite .",

    "it is found that , compared with a canonical global monopole , for the same false vacuum and symmetry breaking scale , a dbi global monopole has a smaller core and the absolute value of its effective mass is larger , then it can give a larger deflect angle to the light passing by .",

    "we choose @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "the three curves are plotted in the condition that @xmath77 ( which correspond to a canonical global monopole ) , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the numerical results of @xmath83 are shown in fig.[fig : m ] by a shooting method for boundary value problems where @xmath27 = 1 and @xmath64 = 0.001 .",
    "it is easy to find from the figure that the mass function of a dbi global monopole decreases from zero to a negative asymptotic value @xmath73 when @xmath45 approach to infinity .",
    "furthermore , the greater the value of parameter @xmath43 takes , the larger the absolute value of @xmath73 will become .",
    "this means that for the same conditions of potential height @xmath27 and the symmetry breaking scale @xmath26 , the effective mass of a dbi global monopole is less than that of a canonical global monopole .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath84 as a function of parameter @xmath43 for different value of @xmath27 are plotted in fig.[fig : minfty ] .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in fig.[fig : f ] that @xmath38 will trends to unity more quickly when the parameter @xmath43 takes a larger value .",
    "in fact , instead of solving the coupled equations([e - l eq])-([t1 ] ) , it is reasonable to assume the following configuration @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the core radius of the dbi global monopole . it should be noted that assumption ( [ f assume ] ) is not an exact solution of eq.([e - l eq ] ) .",
    "however , it will be shown later that , taking such a simplified model for the monopole configuration is reasonable since it gives us a simple way to discuss the main features of the dbi global monopole .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that this assumption means that the monopole is modeled by a false vacuum inside the core , and a true vacuum at the exterior .",
    "thus , the einstein equation inside the core can be solved by de sitter metric : @xmath87 with @xmath88 , while the exterior solution formally reads @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the effective mass function of the dbi global monopole .",
    "comparing eq.([a ex ] ) with eq.([outside ] ) under the assumption of eq.([f assume ] ) , for the region of @xmath91 , one can obtain that @xmath92 thus , using the continuity of the first derivatives of metric with respect to radical proper distance @xmath45 , we obtain the expression for the core radius : @xmath93 for a canonical global monopole , which corresponds to the case that @xmath94 , the core size @xmath95 . obviously , the existence of the @xmath43-term shrinks the size of the core .",
    "especially , for large value of @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , the size behaves asymptotically like @xmath97 .",
    "note that the size of the monopole core does not depend on the parameter @xmath64 and then the symmetric breaking scale @xmath26 . if one defines the asymptotic value for @xmath90 , @xmath63 , as @xmath98 it is easy to find that @xmath99 clearly , since the value of parameters @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath43 are always greater than zero , the value of @xmath63 is negative .",
    "in other words , just as that of a canonical global monopole , the effective mass of a dbi global monopole is actually negative .",
    "this conclusion is justified by the numerical results presented above .",
    "it is worth pointing out that when the condition @xmath100 is satisfied , @xmath101 ; however , when @xmath96 , @xmath102 , which does not depend apparently on the value of @xmath27 . actually , to a certain extent , this property is already illustrated in fig.[fig : minfty ] , which shows that the values of @xmath73 for different values of @xmath27 are gradually close to each other as the parameter @xmath43 grows larger .",
    "now let us turn to study the deflection of light around a dbi global monopole",
    ". since we are interested in the light moving outside the monopole core , and the effective mass @xmath70 and @xmath71 approach to their asymptotic value @xmath63 , taking them as a constant @xmath63 is a good approximation .",
    "we consider the geodesic equation in the metric ( [ line element ] ) with @xmath103 , where @xmath104 . by introducing a dimensionless quality @xmath105 ,",
    "it is easy to obtain a second order differential equation with respect to @xmath106 : @xmath107    since @xmath108 , we can obtain the approximate solution of @xmath106 : @xmath109 ^ 2}{l^2 ( 1-\\epsilon^2)}\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the closest approach to the core of the monopole .",
    "thus , when light passes by the monopole , the deflect angle of it will be @xmath111    the last term in eq.([angle ] ) is the modification when compared with the deflect angle passing by an ordinary star .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath112 is negative , this deflection describes a force of repulsive property , not attractive . moreover , since the effective mass of a dbi global monopole is more negative than that of a canonical one in the same condition of false vacuum and the symmetry breaking scale , this deflection is larger than that caused by a canonical global monopole .",
    "global monopole could be formed during the phase transition in the early universe . in this paper , we have generalized the field theory of global monopole to dbi scalar field and investigate the gravitational property of a dbi global monopole in four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "its main gravitational effect can be understood in terms of a deficit solid angle , which reveals a relatively small potential of repulsive nature . compared with a canonical global monopole ,",
    "for the same false vacuum and symmetry breaking scale , a dbi global monopole has a smaller core and the absolute value of its effective mass which is always negative is larger .",
    "when the scale of warp factor @xmath25 becomes infinite or , in other words , the parameter @xmath43 is close to zero , a dbi global monopole reduces to a canonical one and they are not distinct from each other in the circumstance .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath43 , the effective mass of a dbi global monopole is not mainly determined by potential parameter @xmath27 but decided by @xmath43 , which is qualitatively different from that of a canonical or other type of non - canonical global monopole .    as a kind of @xmath11-monopole ,",
    "there certainly exist some common features between dbi monopole discussed here and the @xmath11-monopole model considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "for example , they both produce tiny gravitational field outside the core in addition to a solid angular deficit , and both of the non - canonical kinetic terms in the two models can exert significant influences on the effective mass of the monopole .",
    "however , the most obvious difference between them is that the effective mass of a @xmath11-monopole considered in ref.@xcite can be positive , while that of a dbi monopole is always negative .",
    "it is noteworthy that , throughout the paper , we only consider global monopole solution in a dbi scalar field theory in which the warp factor is assumed to be constant . as a matter of fact , in string / m theory , the effective dbi scalar field theory of d - brane usually contains a variable warp factor @xcite .",
    "for example , for a pure @xmath113 throat , it is simply @xmath114 with @xmath115 a constant",
    ". it may be interesting to investigate global monopole solutions in these circumstances , which will be discussed in our preparing work .",
