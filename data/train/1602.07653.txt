    "one of the principal results from loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a discrete spacetime , a network of loops implemented by spin networks @xcite which is a digital / computational substrate of reality .",
    "so in order to better understand this substrate , it is natural to use tools from quantum information / quantum computation .",
    "gravity , from a general perspective , has been studied with thermodynamic methods and in recent years numerous questions on black hole entropy and entanglement entropy have made these intense fields of research .",
    "on the side of quantum information and quantum computation there have been large improvements , including the development of many tools and we will herein consider here the framework of the coined discrete time quantum walk ( dqw ) .",
    "we will see that the problem of a quantum particle on a fixed spin network background from lqg can be worked out with the dqw .",
    "this gives rise to a new understanding of entanglement entropy and entropic force , permitting the proposal of a model for dynamics . from an ontological viewpoint",
    "we will see that dynamics and mass emerge from the spin network topology , and that quantum walk implements it .    in summary we will reinterpret some results from lqg trying to approach a quantum information perspective of a quantum geometric spacetime .",
    "one more step in direction of wheeler s ` it from bit ' , or ` it from qubit ' .",
    "we start by considering a quantum particle on a quantum gravitational field from lqg @xcite . in lqg ,",
    "spin networks define quantum states of the gravitational field . to consider a quantum particle on this gravitational field we consider the state space built from tensor product of the gravity state @xmath4 and the particle state @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the lqg state space can be spanned by a spin network basis @xmath7 that is a spin network graph @xmath8 , with @xmath9 vertices ( nodes ) colouring and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) links colouring . for the particle state space",
    "the relevant contribution comes from the position on the nodes of graph @xmath12 , spanned by @xmath13 where ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the quantum state of the particle captures information from discrete geometry and can not be considered independently from it .",
    "therefore the hilbert space is spanned by @xmath15 and the hamiltonian operator can be derived by fixing a spin network , and calculating the matrix element of this operator @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , for the interaction between the particle and the fixed gravity state space @xcite we have , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant that we can initially take as equal to one , @xmath20 are the final points of the link @xmath21 and @xmath22 the initial points .",
    "so if the link @xmath21 starts at node @xmath23 and ends at node @xmath24 we can change the notation , relabelling the color of this link @xmath21 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 and the wave function on the end points as @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "now , for @xmath28 , we have @xmath29    the operator @xmath28 is positive semi - definite , and the ground state of @xmath28 corresponds to the case where the particle is maximally delocalized .",
    "this leads to entropy @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite it was considered that the classical random walk is associated with ( [ eq : isaiashamiltonian ] ) , a markov chain .",
    "the transition probabilities for this random walk are @xmath30 and @xcite shows that this reproduces an entropic force .",
    "this random walk is implemented with the laplacian read off from ( [ eq : isaiashamiltonian ] ) and differs from the laplacians coming from the discrete calculus calculate in @xcite .",
    "we will consider dqw related with those more general laplacians in other work .      as we are studying the influence of a discrete geometry on a quantum field , it is natural to consider the quantum version of this random walk . to have a dqw we need an auxiliary subspace , the coin space , to define the unitary evolution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a swap operation to change the position to a neighbour node and @xmath33 is the coin operator related to this auxiliary subspace . on some graphs its clear how to define the coin hilbert space @xcite but for the spin network considered above its not clear exactly what auxiliary space to use .",
    "for a more general approach we can make use of szegedy s dqw @xcite , which we can work in two ways ; 1- consider a bipartite walk ; or 2 - a walk with memory .",
    "for a bipartite walk , if we consider a graph @xmath12 we can simply make an operation of duplication to obtain a second graph @xmath34 , but for our purpose here , it s better to consider the second option : for the walk with memory , consider the @xmath35-dimensional hilbert space @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath35 is the number of the nodes @xmath40 .",
    "the state of the walk is given in the product @xmath41 spanned by these bases , by states at the previous @xmath42 and current @xmath43 steps , defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the transition probabilities that define a classical random walk , a markov chain , which is a discrete time stochastic process without a memory , with @xmath46 note that ( [ eq : transitionpequal1 ] ) is implied by definition of ( [ eq : isaiasprobabilitie ] ) .",
    "for the evolution we can consider a simplified version of szegedy s dqw @xcite , by defining a reflection , which we can interpret with the unitary `` coin '' operator , @xmath47 and a reflection with inverse action of the @xmath48 swap ( previous and current step ) that can be implemented by a generalized swap operation @xmath49 and we have the unitary evolution @xmath50 that defines the dqw .",
    "so using szegedy s approach is a straightforward way to obtain the discrete quantum walk on the spin network @xmath12 considered above .",
    "it is given by equations ( [ eq : szegedystate ] - [ eq : szegedyevolution ] ) with @xmath48 given by ( [ eq : isaiasprobabilitie ] ) .",
    "namely , for equation ( [ eq : szegedystate ] ) @xmath51 we can interpret that the coin space , the space of decisions encapsulating a non deterministic process and getting memory so that we have a unitary evolution ( deterministic ) , makes the usual entropy convert into entanglement entropy between steps in time .",
    "szegedy s dqw is a general algorithm to quantize a markov chain defined by transition probabilities @xmath52 .",
    "these transition probabilities are obtained directly from the hamiltonian of the system , so that szegedy s dqw is used to simulate this system with quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we turn now to calculate entanglement entropy .",
    "consider the schmidt decomposition .",
    "take a hilbert space @xmath53 and decompose it into two subspaces @xmath54 of dimension @xmath55 and @xmath56 of dimension @xmath57 , so @xmath58 let @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and positive real numbers @xmath62 , then the schmidt decomposition read @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the schmidt coefficients and the number of the terms in the sum is the schmidt rank , which we label @xmath65 . with this we can calculate the entanglement entropy between the two subspaces @xmath66 we can now calculate the local entanglement entropy between the previous step and the current @xmath24 step ( similar for current and next ) . identify the schmidt coefficients @xmath64 with @xmath45 given by ( [ eq : isaiasprobabilitie ] ) and from ( [ eq : szegedystate-1 ] ) we see that the schmidt rank @xmath65 is the valence of the node",
    ". then insert in ( [ eq : schmidtdecomp ] , [ eq : defentanglemententropy ] ) , and the local entanglement entropy on current step is @xmath67 by maximizing entanglement entropy @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the largest valence .",
    "which gives the entropic force for gravity worked out in @xcite with @xmath70 proportional to a small number identified with the particle mass @xmath71 @xmath72 where , if we take the logarithm of ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtimemax ] ) to be base 2 , @xmath73 is a constant of dimension @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "here we have different interpretations and applications . with the dqw we have unitary evolution by encoding a non - deterministic part of the classical markov chain .",
    "this gives an internal structure for the particle , and entanglement entropy .",
    "in this digital physics substrate the particle is walking to maximizing entanglement entropy related to a memory of its walking path ( a measurement of the system on @xmath24 implies the state at previous @xmath23 ) and this generates an entropic force .",
    "in fact we can consider von neumann entropy ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtime ] ) in the context of quantum information .",
    "the probabilities are the markov chain connecting the steps : so the particles are constructing `` words '' while walking and this entropy measures the information needed . from which we can see the entropic force emerge .",
    "the framework above simulates a quantum field interacting with a fixed discrete geometry from quantum gravity which can be related to a gravitational entropic force .",
    "consider now a regime from pure quantum gravity , like the black hole quantum horizon , so that there are no quantum fields , only quantum geometry .",
    "we can try to use this dqw to simulate this regime .",
    "note that dwq implies a local entanglement entropy ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtime ] ) in the sense that the chain / network is always under construction in this pixelated animated view .",
    "this resembles the isolated quantum horizons formulation from lqg @xcite that gives an understanding of the origins of black hole entropy in lqg . in this scenario",
    "the horizon and your area is emergent from the stepwise animated reality at the planck scale , that in our case is simulated by dqw .",
    "we can propose that this dqw is the black hole quantum horizon , where the particle mass is the black hole mass in a random quantum walk on a fixed spin network .    in the isolated quantum horizons formulation",
    "the entropy is usually calculated by considering the eigenvalues of the area operator @xmath75 and introducing an area interval @xmath76 $ ] of the order of the planck length , with relation to the classical area @xmath77 of the horizon .",
    "@xmath75 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the barbero - immirzi parameter and @xmath80 the planck length .",
    "the entropy , in adimensional form , is @xmath81 with @xmath82 the number of microstates of quantum geometry on the horizon ( area interval @xmath77 ) implemented , combinatorially , by considering states with links sequences that implement the two conditions @xmath83 related to the area , where @xmath84 is the number of admissible @xmath85 that puncture the horizon area , and @xmath86 related to the flux with @xmath87 the magnetic quantum number satisfying the condition @xmath88 . to compare with bekenstein - hawking entropy",
    "only the first condition is important .",
    "the detailed calculation @xcite shows that the dominant contribution to entropy comes from states in which there is a very large number of punctures .",
    "thus , it is very attractive to interpret this entropy by quantum informational entropy ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtime ] ) .",
    "let s investigate how the horizon area and related entropy can be emergent from maximal entanglement entropy of a dqw .",
    "condition ( [ eq : conditionbhentropy1 ] ) is associated with this dqw . from ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtime ] and [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtimemax ] ) , considering edge coloring , the maximal entanglement entropy occurs for states on nodes of large valence @xmath69 and sequence with @xmath89 ( @xmath90 .",
    "so for the entropy calculation we can consider that admissible @xmath85 that puncture the horizon area respect this sequences and the nodes associated have large valence .",
    "so we can rewrite condition ( [ eq : conditionbhentropy1 ] ) as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of admissible nodes , with @xmath93 and each @xmath94 is calculated from @xmath95 and considering the dominant contributions given by the over - estimate @xmath96 and counting @xmath97 that will give @xmath82 , each @xmath94 is a integer strictly greater than @xmath98 @xmath99 which means that the combinatorial problem we need to solve is to find @xmath97 such that ( [ eq : conditionbhentropya ] ) holds , i.e. counting the ordered @xmath92-tuples of integers strictly greater than @xmath98 summing to @xmath96 .",
    "this was discussed in a similar problem in @xcite and it is straightforward of the set of ordered tuples of integers strictly greater than @xmath98 summing to @xmath96 is the @xmath100 fibonacci number @xmath101 . ] to see that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the golden ratio . ] .",
    "we conjecture now that this entropy , relating to states that give maximal entanglement entropy , is just the entanglement entropy of the dqw .",
    "so the holographic quantum horizon can be simulated by the dqw with maximal internal entanglement entropy .",
    "the walker move is from node @xmath23 to node @xmath24 both with large valence so that equation ( [ eq : deltaentropyequalmass ] ) works .",
    "if we consider a walker mass spanning @xmath104 with planck mass @xmath105 , we can choose the proportionality constant so that @xmath106 so @xmath107 gives the amount of information on horizon , and @xmath108 is given in @xmath109 .",
    "we can make explicit the @xmath110 on ( [ eq : blackholeentropylognphi ] ) so that it is given in @xmath109 too and propose that @xmath111 , and that this measure of information gives the emergent bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "dqws capture the black hole information , so to infer your entropy , someone needs to make contact with some frame of dqw , the particle that simulates black holes will be more probable on a node of maximal entanglement entropy , this encapsulates @xmath112 .",
    "note that @xmath112 is really not the usual statistical entropy because we have not taken into account all of the microstates , nor the flux condition . from ( [ eq : blackholeentropyklnn ] ) the black hole entropy , changing the logarithm , is @xmath113 so bekenstein - hawking entropy is recovered by setting the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath114 showing that the states of maximal entanglement entropy are dominant to black hole entropy .",
    "so we can think of bekenstein - hawking entropy as emergent from the local entanglement entropy above .",
    "a horizon area @xmath77 spanning @xmath115 planck areas has @xmath104 @xmath116 like ( [ eq : deltaentropyequalmass-1 ] ) .",
    "the clebsh - gordan condition at each node is implied by covering the graph with loops . from ( [ eq : isaiasprobabilitie ] ) and ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwtime ] )",
    "we can compute the local entropy from a node as @xmath117 where @xmath118 of neighbour links .",
    "for example at a node @xmath119 , @xmath120 gives @xmath121 and @xmath122 . at a node @xmath123",
    ", @xmath124 gives @xmath125 , @xmath126 which is the maximal possible local entropy .",
    "note ( [ eq : entanglemententropyqwlocalformtoymodel ] ) is the local entropy formula given in @xcite as 14 , and in accordance with well known lqg formulas for quantized length and quantized area .",
    "the local entropy at each node is color coded . from equation ( [ eq : deltaentropyequalmass ] ) a massless particle move on same color and a massive particle moves along constant absolute color differences .    in the following figure : + ( blue)@xmath127 or @xmath128 ( side effect ) + ( white ) ... @xmath129 + ( yellow ) ... @xmath130 + ( orange ) ... @xmath119 + ( red ) ... @xmath123 .",
    "+ dynamics : + photons could orbit on orange hexagons . no possible particles with constant mass . possible travel of massive particle , with @xmath131 , ( @xmath132 ) interacting with photons at some orange node .        the walker position , or the presence of a particle at one node is encoded by a triangle .",
    "its move is a couple of 3 - 1 and 1 - 3 pachner moves on neighbor positions , piloted by the walk probability",
    "results from loop quantum gravity suggest the interesting idea that we can apply the results and tools from quantum information and quantum computation to a quantum spacetime . this is a field of research very promising . in this work",
    "we start a project to apply this tools like dqw to spacetime .",
    "we considered a dqw of a quantum particle on a quantum gravitational field and studyied applications of related entanglement entropy .",
    "this memory time related entanglement entropy can drive an entropic force and give contribution to black hole entropy . with this we proposed a model for a walker position topologically",
    "encoded on spin network .",
    "this results in anomaly cancellation because the particle is no longer a point but has planck scale size .",
    "we note that more complex models can be build , with more dimension and 8 quantum numbers in e8 model @xcite and models with realistic emergent masses can be explored by computation .",
    "a better understanding of entanglement entropy on black hole and application on cosmology are under investigation , as well as relating this model with quasicrystal e8 model @xcite : the spin network can be choosen as the dual of a quasicrystal and the digital physics rules can be implemented by the quantum walk ."
