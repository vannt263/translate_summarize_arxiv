    "the recent discovery of significant numbers of extrasolar planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 , marcy & butler  1996 ; marcy  1999 ) has driven an outbreak in research into planet formation . previously , our knowledge has been based entirely on one data point : our solar system .",
    "the large increase in the number of known systems has had two major consequences for our understanding of planetary formation and evolution : firstly , it seems that planetary systems are not rare , and secondly that they need not conform to solar system type configurations . specifically , the fact that the extrasolar planets discovered so far are gas giants commonly in close orbits was unexpected according to theories based upon the planets in the solar system ( eg lissauer  1993 ; ruden  1999 ) .",
    "this has led to new theories to explain how gas giants that form at distances similar to jupiter from their central star can migrate inwards to occupy the close orbits as has been found ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson  1996 ) .",
    "forming the gas giants at such distances is seen as improbable due to the lack of sufficient condensable material for planetesimal growth .",
    "a further complication to planet formation may arise due to the fact that stars are commonly found and perhaps generally formed in stellar clusters .",
    "in addition to the well known globular and open clusters , recent ir surveys have shown that most young stars are found in dense embedded clusters ( cf .",
    "clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand  2000 ) .",
    "the density of these clusters range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 stars pc@xmath1 in the core of the orion nebular cluster ( onc ) .",
    "larger clusters such as r136 in 30 doradus have even higher densities ( @xmath4 ) and are probably more appropriate for the early conditions of globular clusters .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate how the high stellar density in such regions affect both planet formation and planetary survival .",
    "cluster membership has other disadvantages as the proximity of massive stars can also act to impede planet formation ( armitage  2000 ) .",
    "in determining how relevant stellar interactions are for planets and planet formation , we have to consider not only the present cluster conditions but also the cluster s previous evolution .",
    "although it is difficult if not impossible to determine the previous evolution in individual cases , we can estimate probable evolutionary histories by considering cluster dynamics and initial conditions .",
    "firstly , if we consider the young ( embedded ) clusters found in star forming regions , they generally contain significant amounts of mass in the form of gas .",
    "for example , the onc is believed to contain 50 per cent of its mass in gas ( hillenbrand & hartmann  1998 ) .",
    "as the imf and median mass are typical of field stars ( hillenbrand  1997 ) , the majority of this mass will be ejected from the system . in general , the mass that is not accreted will help unbind the cluster .",
    "the evolution of the cluster undergoing gas removal depends critically on the gas fraction and on the removal timescale ( lada , dearborn & margulis 1984 , goodwin  1997 ) .",
    "simulations of cluster expansion due to gas expulsion have shown that for clusters that do survive , they generally increase their half - mass radii by factors of @xmath5 ( kroupa , aarseth and hurley  2000 ; goodwin , pearce & thomas  2000 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a decrease in the mean cluster density of 10 to 100 .",
    "another way of quantifying this expansion is by comparing the youngest embedded clusters with older open clusters .",
    "thus , from densities of @xmath6 to @xmath7   typical of the onc the clusters must evolve towards densities of @xmath8  typical of open clusters .",
    "this is probably a lower limit as some gas removal may have already occurred in the youngest systems .",
    "furthermore , the lower frequency of open compared to embedded clusters implies that many of the embedded clusters do not survive the expansion phase .",
    "the timescale for this high density phase is likely to be the lifetime of the most massive stars in the system . especially in systems with high velocity dispersions such as young globulars , multiple supernova events are the likely cause of gas removal and thus setting a timescale of several @xmath9 years .",
    "after gas removal , the cluster will continue to expand due to a combination of mass segregation , tidal interactions with the galaxy which removes stars from the cluster ( eg terlevich  1987 ) and binaries which absorb a large fraction of the binding energy .",
    "the combination of all these effects can typically increase the cluster s radius substantially and thus decreases the stellar density .",
    "simulations of post core - collapse clusters including the effect of binaries have shown a decrease in density of @xmath10 ( giersz & heggie  1997 ) when not filling their tidal radius .    from these considerations , we can estimate that cluster densities generally decrease by factors of 10 to @xmath11 ( or possibly up to 1000 in some cases ) over their evolution .",
    "although these higher density phases may have occurred over much shorter timescales , they could potentially have had dramatic effects on any planetary systems .",
    "the clusters we consider here range from the low density open clusters in the stellar neighbourhood to the globular clusters such as 47 tuc and the possible precursers of both of these types of systems .",
    "open clusters generally have stellar densities of @xmath12 and ages of @xmath13 years with low velocity dispersions , @xmath14 .",
    "based on the above discussion , precursers of such systems probably had densities of @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( possibly as high as @xmath17 )  with still low velocity dispersions of a few .",
    "globular clusters commonly have densities of @xmath18 ages of @xmath19 years and velocity dispersions of @xmath20 .",
    "precursers of present - day globular clusters , again based upon expectations from gas expulsion and later evolution , are likely to have had densities of @xmath4  to @xmath21  over their first few million years .",
    "the first potential effect of the stellar environment on any planetary systems is on their potential for formation .",
    "most theories for the formation of gas giant planets involve the slow growth of planetesimals through collisional processes in the circumstellar disc .",
    "this process requires sufficient condensible material in the disc which in most disc models only exist beyond a few from the star . in this scenario ,",
    "any gas giant closer to the parent star has to undergo an inward migration , possibly due to the torques from the accretion disc ( lin et .",
    "al .  1996 ) .",
    "the growth from planetesimals to a planetary core can take up to a million years , while the subsequent gas accretion to build a giant planet can take up to 10 million years ( eg .",
    "lissauer  1993 ; pollack  1996 ) .",
    "thus , if extrasolar planet formation occurs in an analogous fashion as is believed to have occurred in our solar system , then the primary requirement is that the circumstellar disc is present and relatively stable over such timescales . in a crowded region",
    ", any stellar encounters can perturb this disc and thus suppress its planet forming potential .",
    "in addition , any encounter that occurs before the planet has migrated is likely to eject the planet from the system .",
    "investigations of stellar encounters including non - self gravitating circumstellar discs have shown that the encounters generally remove any material exterior to one - third of the periastron distance ( hall , clarke & pringle  1996 ) .",
    "so , for example , if a star passes within 10 of another , this will remove all disc material exterior to @xmath22 .",
    "if we assume that any giant planets will form at separations typical of the gas giants in the solar system , then any encounters within 10 will suppress the formation of gas - giant planets .",
    "alternatively , encounters within 50 will truncate the circumstellar disc to @xmath23 , which will impede some planet formation and possibly affect the subsequent migration of any inner planets .",
    "for a given star in the cluster , the mean time interval , @xmath24 , between encounters within a distance  is ( binney & tremaine  1987 ) :    @xmath25    from equation  [ eqtcoll ] we can see that the timescale for an encounter depends on both the stellar density @xmath26 and the velocity dispersion @xmath27 in addition to the interaction length @xmath28 . the first term in brackets on the right hand side represents the contribution of the geometric cross section of the target , the second term represents the effect of gravitational focussing .",
    "figure  [ detdenstimea ] plots the timescale for encounters within 0.5 , 10 and 50 for clusters containing 240 and @xmath29 stars as a function of the stellar density ( @xmath27 is chosen to ensure that the clusters are virialised ) .",
    "we see that for encounters within a disc radius to occur within the planet formation timescales , @xmath30 years , requires relatively high stellar densities ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the required densities are lower for larger clusters due to their larger velocity dispersions . in order for encounters to seriously affect planet formation ( @xmath30 years ) , cluster densities of @xmath4",
    "are required .",
    "such densities are high relative to today s globular clusters but are not unreasonable for the earliest phase of a globular cluster s lifetime before expansion due to gas expulsion .",
    "it is interesting to note that encounters within 0.5 are not expected to occur on reasonable timescales for most clusters and even a high density phase would have to be very long ( @xmath31 years ) in order to have appreciable numbers of encounters that close to the parent star .",
    "thus , the disruption of close - in gas giant planets is unlikely to occur due to encounters in a stellar cluster . in this context , in order to explain the lack of close - in giant planets in 47 tuc ( brown  2000 ; gilliland  2000 ) requires that either the giant planets did not form or that they did not migrate .",
    "figure  [ destdensvel ] plots the necessary conditions in terms of cluster density and velocity dispersions for encounters within 10 and 50 ( of a 1.0  star ) to occur on timescales of two and ten million years",
    ". the timescale decreases with increasing density and , weakly , for increasing velocity dispersion . for example",
    "an encounter within 10 will occur in ten million years for clusters with densities @xmath32  and velocity dispersion of @xmath33  whereas clusters with densities of @xmath34  and velocity dispersion of @xmath33  will have similar encounters within one million years .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ destdensvel ] show the possible evolutions in density - velocity space of clusters with @xmath35 and @xmath36 stars , as they expand ( assuming virialised conditions ) .",
    "thus , if the planet formation timescale is @xmath37 years , stars in a cluster of @xmath38 stars with densities @xmath39  will typically have their discs stripped through stellar interactions before they are able to form gas giant planets .",
    "the effect of the number of stars on the necessary cluster conditions can be seen in figure  [ destnvel ] which shows the critical densities for encounters within 10 and 50 ( of a 1.0  star ) on timescales of 2 and 10 million years as a function of the number of stars in the cluster .",
    "the decrease in critical densities in larger - n systems is due to the larger velocity dispersions in such systems . from this",
    ", it can be seen that densities @xmath3 start to become interesting for disrupting some outer planets or the outer disc whereas densities @xmath4 are required to affect planets that form at distances of @xmath40 .    combining the expected evolution of clusters of different numbers of stars and the expected encounter timescale",
    ", we expect that encounters within 10 can occur within the planet forming timescale in the large - n globular clusters but not in the smaller - n open ( embedded ) clusters .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the expected densities in the earliest stages of the cluster evolution combined with the higher critical densities for encounters in the low - n systems .",
    "planetary systems that do succeed in forming in a stellar cluster are then subject to disruptions from stellar encounters .",
    "once a planet has formed , and possibly migrated to its final separation from the parent star , the probability of a disruptive encounter depends on this separation and on the cluster properties . in order to quantify this probability we performed simulations of the evolution of a population of planets in various cluster conditions .",
    "the initial distribution of planetary orbits was taken to be flat in log separation , and spanned a range of 0.01 to 100 .",
    "two main cluster types were investigated , globular clusters and open clusters . for the globular cluster case , we chose a velocity dispersion of 10 .",
    "for the open cluster case , the velocity dispersion is 2 .",
    "we then used equation([eqtcoll ] ) to calculate the probability of encounters within various time intervals and cluster densities ( see figures  [ case11 ] and  [ case12 ] ) . in each case , the total time interval was split into smaller time steps , so that multiple encounters were possible .",
    "the effect of an encounter on a planetary system was determined as follows . where the kinetic energy of the perturber was greater than the binding energy of the planet , the planetary system was assumed to be detroyed ( or ` ionised ' ) . where the kinetic energy of the perturber was less than the binding energy of the planetary system , the planet was assumed to lose energy and move closer to its parent star ( the system is ` hardened ' ) .",
    "this hardening was taken to be 25% , based on average values obtained in binary - single star scattering experiments ( sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; davies 1997 ) . in the former case , the system is termed ` soft ' , while in the latter , it is said to be ` hard ' .",
    "the hard / soft boundary is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the masses of the primary , secondary ( in this case planet ) and of the perturber star .",
    "the encounter velocity , @xmath43 is essentially the velocity dispersion , , of the cluster .    from equation  [ hardsoft ]",
    "we see that most planetary systems , where @xmath44 is small , are ` soft ' and will easily be ionised through encounters .",
    "the question of hardenning is therefore not crucial to our conclusions .",
    "in addition , encounters can drive eccentricity into the planetary system , and thus potentially further instability ( davies & sigurdsson  2000 ) .",
    "the results from our simulations are divided into two sections depending on the chosen velocity dispersion .",
    "firstly we present the results appropriate for globular clusters with @xmath45 , then those for open clusters with @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ case11 ] presents the results for the planetary systems in clusters where the velocity dispersion is @xmath10 .",
    "the figure is broken up into different panels each appropriate for a specific stellar density and for a specific amount of time .",
    "globular clusters have typical core densities of @xmath47 , mean densities of @xmath18  and lifetimes that extend to the age of the galaxy ( @xmath48 years ) .",
    "the cluster densities increase from left to right and the time increases from top to bottom .",
    "the dotted lines give the initial planetary distribution while the heavy solid lines give the final planetary distribution .",
    "the light solid lines indicate the fraction of planetary systems , and their initial separations , that have been ionised .",
    "the overall result is that the wider ( softer ) systems are more easily disrupted than are the tighter systems . their larger cross section for an encounter results in lower critical densities and in shorter encounter timescales .",
    "tighter systems require higher stellar densities in order to ensure a reasonable timescale for an encounter .",
    "furthermore , a cluster of given stellar density will disrupt increasingly tighter systems with time until reaching the hard / soft boundary .",
    "thus , wide systems are disrupted in most clusters although they do require longer timescales in the least dense clusters .",
    "in contrast , the tighter systems are only disrupted in sufficiently old , dense , clusters .",
    "it can be seen that in the case of @xmath49 , all systems are soft .",
    "there is no hardening ( moving planets to smaller separations ) and any system that is perturbed is disrupted .",
    "this occurs as the hard / soft boundary is at @xmath50 or 4 ( smaller than the separations considered here ) .",
    "thus some hardening can be expected of only the tightest of planetary systems .",
    "it should be noted that probable evolutionary paths ( based on the discussion of   2 ) of a globular cluster through this diagram will be from the upper right ( gas - rich cluster ) towards the lower left . in general , any high density phase , will last for @xmath51 years whereas subsequent phases will last successively longer as the cluster evolves on a relaxation timescale .",
    "it is also worth noting that the long time - periods that a cluster spends in the less dense phases can actually be more destructive of the relatively short - period planetary systems than are the short - lived high - density phases .",
    "present day globular clusters such as 47 tuc have mean stellar densities ( near the half - mass radius ) and ages that put them in the lower - left part of figure  [ case11 ] ( densities of @xmath18  and ages of @xmath19 years ) .",
    "thus , any planetary systems with separations @xmath52 are likely to have suffered a disruptive encounter and no systems with separations greater than 10 should still exist . in the core of such a cluster with densities @xmath3 ,",
    "even those systems as tight as 0.1 are likely to be disrupted and only those with separations @xmath53 are completely safe .",
    "even these systems can be disrupted if the core density is as high as @xmath17 .",
    "lower densities typical of the halo of the cluster will leave wider systems ( @xmath54 ) intact .",
    "planetary systems with very small separations @xmath55 are generally unaffected by stellar encounters in globular clusters unless the cluster density was extremely large ( @xmath4 ) for the majority of the cluster s lifetime ( @xmath56 years ) .",
    "thus , the only way to destroy tight planetary systems in globular clusters is to destroy the disc before the planet forms and before it has a chance to migrate inwards .",
    "if the planet forms in situ , then stellar encounters are not a promising way of disrupting the system .",
    "figure  [ case12 ] shows the contrasting case more typical of open clusters where the velocity dispersion is a few .",
    "the first difference to note is that the hard / soft boundary for planetary systems is significantly further out ( @xmath57 0.6 ) and that a cluster with large densities for long time periods could experience significant hardening .",
    "typical densities and lifetimes of open clusters ( @xmath58  and @xmath59 years ) precluding significant hardening of planetary systems as the probability of encounters near the hard / soft boundary is not very high . in general , most planetary systems",
    "are not adversely affected by stellar encounters in open clusters .",
    "significant disruption only occurs for systems with separations @xmath33 .",
    "even an early high density phase is unlikely to be sufficiently dense or long - lived to cause much disruption to any but the widest of planetary systems .      in order to illustrate how the cluster evolution might affect the planetary populations , we have repeated the simulations of  5.1 and  5.2 but with time - dependent parameters ( density and velocity dispersion ) , designed to mimic a simple cluster evolution model .",
    "an example of this is included in figure [ evolclus ] for a cluster containing @xmath29 stars .",
    "we assume an initial stellar density of @xmath29  during the gas rich phase which persists for several @xmath9 years .",
    "once the gas is expelled , the density decreases rapidly to @xmath60 .",
    "the subsequent evolution has four possibilities .",
    "firstly a constant density representing a non - evolving cluster .",
    "secondly a cluster that continues to expand on its relaxation timescale or , thirdly , on ten relaxation times .",
    "these model evolutions include , in a heuristic way , the effects expected from relaxation ( chernoff & weinberg  1990 ) and from binary heating ( giersz & heggie  1997 ) .",
    "lastly , a model where the cluster expands on ten relaxation times is included to illustrate the effects of core - collapse on any planetary systems in the cluster core .",
    "it should be noted that the different evolutionary models can be taken to represent different parts of the cluster .",
    "each model is evolved up to @xmath61 years , while the velocity dispersion is adjusted such that the cluster is virialised .",
    "we see that the initial high density phase can disrupt any systems ( or discs ) that extend to several ( to ten ) or more .",
    "systems with smaller separations are disrupted during the following less - dense phases due to their longer timescales .",
    "the fastest evolving model destroys the fewest planetary systems but still leaves only those closer than @xmath55 with a 50 % chance of survival at @xmath62 .",
    "the model that evolves on ten relaxation times destroys almost all systems @xmath63 whereas the constant density model removes systems @xmath0 . the model with increasing density",
    "such as occurs in a core - collapse removes systems @xmath64 with a 50 % survival rate interior to @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these last two evolutions include significant hardening inside @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus in this simplified model there should still be some gas giants on very tight orbits .",
    "an interesting question to pose is what can we deduce of the probable natal environment of the sun and whether such an environment would leave a detectable trace in the solar system .",
    "the existence of the planets in the solar system and beyond them of the kuiper belt to @xmath68 ( jewitt & luu  2000 ) implies that any stellar encounters must have been more distant than that .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the sun spent a significant fraction of its lifetime in a high density environment .",
    "alternatively , the apparent lack of kuiper belt objects beyond 50 ( hahn  2000 ) could imply a stellar encounter that truncated the solar system at that radius ( see also ida , larwood & burkert  2000 ) .",
    "if this is the correct interpretation , we can deduce from figure  [ case12 ] the probable cluster properties in order to have a significant probability of such an encounter .",
    "thus , the sun could have been a member of an open cluster with a mean density of @xmath69  for @xmath70 to nearly @xmath71 years , or alternatively , that the cluster had an earlier high - density phase with either a density of @xmath18  for @xmath72 to nearly @xmath73 years or a density of @xmath47  for @xmath74 a few @xmath9 years .",
    "the existence of the oort cloud beyond the limit of the kuiper belt implies that any interaction would have had to happen before the bulk of the oort cloud was ejected from the solar nebular disc , thus within a few @xmath75 years .",
    "this is possible if the sun was born in a cluster with a density of @xmath76 that dissolved , or evolved to a lower density , within @xmath77 years .",
    "one of the implications of stellar encounters disrupting planetary systems in stellar clusters is that there should then be a population of free - floating planets .",
    "such a population due to stellar encounters is unlikely to be significant in most open clusters as these clusters are not sufficiently long - lived .",
    "even fewer free - floating planets are expected in the young clusters due to the disruption of planetary systems .",
    "alternatively , the more frequent disruption of planetary systems in globular clusters should result in a population of free - floating planets .",
    "for example , in clusters with ages @xmath78 years and densities @xmath15 , any planetary systems with separations @xmath52 should have been disrupted and these planets liberated into the cluster .",
    "if such systems resemble our own , then a number of planets would be liberated per event .",
    "the likelihood for finding free - floating planets depends on their velocities .",
    "in open clusters any free - floating planets are likely to have velocities after disruption well in excess of the escape speed ( smith & bonnell  2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , post - disruption velocities in globulars are more likely to be comparable or less than the higher escape speeds there ( smith & bonnell  2000 ) . in either case , due to their low - mass",
    ", subsequent two - body encounters will increase their velocity dispersion and thus limit their lifetime in the cluster .",
    "we have shown that young planetary systems similar to the solar system have a good chance of surviving their early years if they have the good fortune to form in an open cluster environment .",
    "planetary systems formed in globular clusters , on the other hand , face two major obstacles to their reaching adulthood .",
    "firstly , the natal disk from which planets could form must survive for at least a few million years .",
    "if the earliest stages of a globular cluster include a high - density phase ( @xmath79 ) then the circumstellar disc can be truncated inside the region where gas - giant planets are believed to form . such a high density phase is consistent with expectations based on the efficiency of star formation in nearby embedded ( young ) stellar clusters and on subsequent cluster dynamics .",
    "this could explain the recent find of a lack of close planets in 47 tuc ( brown  2000 , gilliland  2000 ) .    secondly , the planetary systems must endure a constant bombardment from neighbouring star systems .",
    "these interactions will destroy most planetary systems beyond about 0.3 over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "we conclude that giant planet formation may be made more difficult in a globular cluster and that any that do form are unlikely to survive unless their orbits are @xmath80 .",
    "the planets thrown out by interactions would be expected to form a population of free substellar bodies in the cluster .",
    "the velocity obtained by them from the initial disruption and subsequent encounters are likely to be higher than the escape velocity of the cluster and thus free - floating planets should not form a significant population in stellar clusters .",
