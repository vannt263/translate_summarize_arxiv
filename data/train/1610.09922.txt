    "nano(micro)-mechanical oscillator , due to its applications in ultra - high precise sensing and testing quantum phenomenon at macroscopic scale @xcite , has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years . combined with cavity opto- and electro - mechanics , the mechanical oscillator ( mo ) has been explored extensively as a quantum interface @xcite . besides",
    ", strong coupling for hybrid mo systems have been realized , which can be used to achieve ground state cooling , quantum information processing etc @xcite .",
    "recently , more and more attentions have been paid on interfacing the mechanical degrees of freedom with a single quantum object such as a 2-level system whose quantum state can be precisely controlled .",
    "it has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally of coupling a nanomechanical oscillator with solid state qubits , such as nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "resonating nanostructures made of single - crystal diamond are expected to possess excellent mechanical properties , including high - quality factors and low dissipation .",
    "diamond has been expected to have great applications as a uniquely versatile material , yet one that is intricate to grow and process .",
    "fortunately , quality factors exceeding one million are found at room temperature , surpassing those of single - crystal silicon cantilevers of similar dimensions by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , diamond hosts interesting intrinsic dopants @xcite  most prominently the nv center  that have been recognized as rich resource for single - photon generation , quantum engineering and nanoscale magnetic sensing . with all these advantages , the diamond nanostructures may lead to wide applications in quantum science .",
    "nv centers are formed by a nitrogen atom and a nearby vacancy in diamond , usually negatively charged , possessing 6 electrons , with spin @xmath0 in the ground state and regarded as artificial atoms in solid systems @xcite . because of the long coherence time and sensitive to magnetic field , they are promising candidates for quantum information processing and also widely used as solid - state ultra sensitive magnetic field sensor .",
    "there are usually two kinds of methods to couple the nv centers with mo .",
    "the first one requires the strain induced effective electric field to mix phonon mode with nv centers electron spins @xcite .",
    "the strain induced coupling is very sensitive to the size of the mo .",
    "the strong coupling regime is very difficult to approach through this direction .",
    "the second one is based on the strong first order magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "for the first method , one of the main problems in the hybrid systems of nv center and mo is the strong coupling condition requiring ultra - high magnetic gradient @xcite .",
    "one way to solve the problem is to reduce the effective mass of the oscillator or trapping frequency @xcite .",
    "here we study the third coupling mechanism between nv center and mo based on second order magnetic coupling , which was studied for heating one mode of the mo to cool the other one to quantum ground regime @xcite .    in this article , we propose a scheme to realize strong coupling between mo and nv center under the second order magnetic field gradient . in section",
    "ii , we firstly introduce a new model used to describe the coupling between mo and nv centers and demonstrate the increased coupling between them . in section iii , we propose the scheme to generate the entanglement and realize state transfer between the nv center and the mo",
    ". then we generalize our model to the interaction between the mo and the nv centers ensemble . in section iv",
    ", we show another application in two - mode squeezing of the mo . in section",
    "v , we give the brief discussion and summary .",
    "as shown in fig.[model ] , a nano - diamond mo is fabricated and oscillates along the @xmath1 axis with two modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while one nv center is hosted at the end of the oscillator @xcite .",
    "two magnetic tips point at each other along @xmath1 axis and are situated at two sides of oscillator symmetrically .",
    "external static magnetic field @xmath4 is added along @xmath5 axis .",
    "the frequency difference between nv center electron spin states @xmath6 and @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the @xmath9 as ground state @xmath10 , and the @xmath11 as the excited @xmath12 .",
    "the driven force is exerted on the oscillator with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the energy split of nv center electron spin is tuned to satisfy the relation @xmath13 . in the rotating frame",
    "@xmath14 , the two modes hamiltonian can be simplified as @xcite@xmath15 \\sigma _ { x } , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath16 , @xmath17 represent the annihilation ( creation ) operator of two oscillator phonon modes , respectively , @xmath18 is the driven strength for the mode @xmath19 , @xmath20 are coupling strength with second order magnetic field gradient .",
    "the pauli operators are defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "firstly , we initialize the nv center to the ground state , and then only the uncoupling hamiltonian term @xmath23 matters . in the presence of the driving , the mo tends to behave coherently .",
    "the dynamics of the mo can be derived through quantum langevin equation @xcite@xmath24 -\\frac{\\gamma _ { 1}}{2}a+\\sqrt{\\gamma _ { 1}}% a_{in } , \\\\ \\dot{b } & = -i\\left [ b , h_{0}\\right ] -\\frac{\\gamma _ { 2}}{2}b+\\sqrt{\\gamma _ { 2}}% b_{in } , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath25 @xmath26 are dissipation rates of modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xmath30 are output noise operator of modes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath31 .",
    "the steady state amplitude of each mode satisfies the relations as below@xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that by increasing the amplitude of phonon mode and thus , increases the coupling strength between nv center and mo .",
    "once the steady state established , we turn the nv center into excited state and the second order interaction between the nv center and mo comes into effect . near steady state , we can make transformation as @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian near steady state takes the form@xmath36 \\sigma _ { x } , \\end{aligned}\\]]in rotating frame @xmath37 and rotating frequency approximation , the effective hamiltonian can be got as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we set the frequency of nv center as @xmath41 , the mode frequency of mo @xmath42 @xmath43 , driving frequency @xmath44 , @xmath45 the dissipation of the a mode @xmath46 .",
    "the second order magnetic field gradient could be in the order of @xmath47 , corresponding to coupling @xmath48 hz @xcite .",
    "here we choose the coupling strength @xmath49 .",
    "we get @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the effective coupling strength can be enhanced by @xmath51 times .",
    "as @xmath52 , the effective coupling strength between the nv center and the mo is greatly enhanced .",
    "furthermore , if there are many nv centers in the end of the mo , the effective interaction between the mo and nv centers could be increased by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of nv centers @xcite . following the above steps",
    ", we can derive the effective hamiltonian as@xmath55where @xmath56 and the interaction among nv centers has been neglected . for this system , from the following analysis , the interaction time decreases to @xmath57 and the fidelity of the state has been lifted .",
    "the basic requirement of quantum information processing is entanglement and state transfer between the nv center and mo . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the entanglement and state transfer for the system of nv center and diamond mo .",
    "we assume that the mo is cooled to near the ground state and nv center is in the state @xmath12 .",
    "we neglect the effects of decoherence at first . from eq .",
    "the system evolves as@xmath58 represent the system state with mo in fock state @xmath59 and nv  center in ground ( excited ) state , respectively .    from the wave function",
    "eq . , we can see that at time @xmath60 , entanglement between nv center and mo is maximal .",
    "the entanglement of system can be measured through negativity , which defined as @xmath61 @xcite , where the partial transformed density matrix @xmath62 has elements @xmath63 and the trace norm @xmath64 which corresponds to the sum of the absolute value of eigenvalues of @xmath65 at this situation , the negativity can be obtained as @xmath66 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath67 is @xmath68 , corresponding to the maximal entanglement .",
    "the jc hamiltonian eq . can also be used for quantum state transfer between nv center and the mo . as the mo s oscillation begins ,",
    "the interaction between the mo  and nv  center is generated and results in the energy exchange between mo  and nv  center .",
    "we can see that at @xmath69 , the state is a product state and the state transfer has been realized , from @xmath70 to @xmath71 and at this moment , the state entanglement decreases to zero corresponding to the minimal value of @xmath72 .    in experiment ,",
    "the effect of the environment should be considered and the state of the system is usually in the mixed state , expressed by density matrix @xmath73 .",
    "we use the following master equation to describe the evolution of the density matrix @xmath74 + \\frac{\\gamma _ { 2}}{2}\\left ( \\overline{n}_{t}+1\\right ) l\\left [ b\\right ] \\rho \\left ( t\\right)\\\\ & + \\frac{\\gamma _ { 2}}{2}\\overline{n}_{t}l\\left [ b^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\rho \\left ( t\\right)+\\frac{d } { 2}l\\left [ \\sigma ^{z}\\right ] \\rho \\left ( t\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath75 denote the dissipation rate of mo and dephasing rate of nv center , respectively and @xmath76 \\rho = 2o\\rho o^{\\dagger } -o^{\\dagger } o\\rho -\\rho o^{\\dagger } o$ ] . in realistic experiment ,",
    "the initial state of phonon is in thermal state and have the form as @xmath77 with @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mean thermal phonon number of mo . here , we suppose mo has been cooled near ground state .",

    ", we explore the entanglement of system using negativity , which can be read from fig.[entanglement ] .",
    "the red line depicts the negativity of pure state and the values of negativity increase with the increasing of entanglement .",
    "the maximal and the minimal values are @xmath68 and @xmath91 , corresponding to the maximal entanglement state and product state , respectively .",
    "however , when we consider the influence of thermal noise of mo , the entanglement can be demolished .",
    "the black dash line shows the negativity with thermal noise .",
    "we can see that the maximal value can no longer reach 1/2 and it decreases with increasing of thermal phonon number , which is shown fig.[entanglement ] .",
    "this is because that state evolves into mixed state due to the thermal phonon , and the components of the target state in density matrix decreases with the increasing of thermal phonon number .",
    "the fidelity is of course the essential parameter in quantum information processing and here we investigate the fidelity of maximal entanglement state and product state .",
    "we define the fidelity between a pure target state latexmath:[$%    @xmath73 as @xmath93 .",
    "that is , the fidelity is equal to the square root of the overlap between @xmath94 and @xmath95 due to the dissipation , dephasing rate and thermal noise , the fidelity decays with time . as fig.[fidelity ] shows , we describe the fidelity under different thermal noise and driving strength . since the thermal phonon can mix other states into the density matrix",
    ", we can see that the fidelity decays with thermal mean photon number increasing .",
    "however , if we increase the driving strength , the effective coupling between the nv center and the mo could be enhanced .",
    "therefore , the operation time for both state transfer and the entanglement generation can be greatly suppressed .",

    "the effective coupling strength has been enhanced and thus , the speed to achieve the operation goes fast , which lead to the increasing of fidelity directly . however ,",
    "more noise could be induced for nv centers ensemble compared with single nv center , which decreases the fidelity .",
    "the competition of two factors lead to the final results of fidelity for two operations . in fig.[fidelityne ] ( upper plot ) , we can see that at beginning , the effect of noise is more obvious and then , the effect of enhanced effective coupling strength play the leader role .",
    "therefore , the fidelity of maximal entanglement decreases firstly and then rises up latter .",
    "but for state transfer as in fig.[fidelityne ] ( lower plot ) , the effect of enhanced effective coupling strength is more obvious that of noise all the time and thus , the fidelity is monotic function of the number of nv centers .    .",
