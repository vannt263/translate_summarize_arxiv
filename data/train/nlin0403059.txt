    "chaotic saddles are the saddle - type invariant cantor sets associated with a horseshoe construction @xcite .",
    "they play a central role in many complex dynamical phenomena , e.g. , the existence of supertransients @xcite and the fractal structure of chaotic scattering @xcite .",
    "the chaotic saddles constructed to date have been related to either homoclinic orbits associated with hyperbolic periodic orbits or special types of equilibria . in this letter",
    "we are concerned with a fundamentally new type of high dimensional chaotic saddle structure that can occur only in hamiltonian systems with three or more degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and we describe a computational method for detecting it which also illustrates its geometrical complexity .    the chaotic saddle is associated with a _ normally hyperbolic invariant manifold _ ( nhim ) @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of nhims arises from the fact that their stable and unstable manifolds control the _ phase space transport _ across equilibria of saddle - centre- ... -centre stability type .",
    "this is is not only the fundamental mechanism for the evolution from reactants to products in chemical reaction , but also for `` transformations '' in general in a large , and diverse , number of applications as e.g. ionisation problems in atomic physics @xcite , rearrangements of clusters @xcite , cosmology @xcite , and solid state and semi - conductor physics @xcite . though it had been recognised that it is important to understand the _ dynamics _ near saddle - centre- ... -centre equilibria it was only recently that new developments in dynamical systems theory offered the theoretical framework and computing power offered the means to study the _ phase space structure _ near saddle - centre- ... -centres for systems with 3 or more dof @xcite . besides the nhim and its stable and unstable manifolds it is now possible to compute a codimension 1 submanifold of the energy surface , the so - called _ transition state _ , which is transverse to the hamiltonian flow and _ locally _ divides the energy surface into two disjoint components .",
    "_ locally _ , the transition state provides the only means of passing from one phase space region ( associated with `` reactants '' ) to another phase space region ( associated with `` products '' ) , i.e. trajectories must cross the transition state in order to `` react '' .",
    "the transversality of the transition state to the hamiltonian flow is essential for rate calculations as it solves the problem of _ locally _ recrossing trajectories .    in this letter",
    "we go beyond this local result and consider more global issues associated with the dynamics related to the transition state and nhim .",
    "in particular , we describe a computational method for determining the existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections to nhims .",
    "using recent results in @xcite , the existence of certain types of these homoclinic orbits allows us to infer the existence of a new type of chaotic saddle ( in fact , a cantor set of chaotic saddles ) .",
    "because of the ubiquity of saddle - centre- ... -centre type equilibria in applications ( as described above ) , we expect that the methods and results presented here , which are applicable to three and more dof , to be of broad interest .",
    "the physical system we choose to illustrate our method is one from celestial mechanics ; the 3-d hill s equations @xcite .",
    "advances in detector technology have opened up new frontiers in celestial mechanics with the discovery of trans - neptunian objects and binary systems in the kuiper belt .",
    "the calculation of capture probabilities requires the study of the 3-d hill s equations ( rather than the thoroughly studied 2-d case ) because many of the capture events occur from high inclination ( see e.g. the recent work by goldreich , lithwick and sari @xcite ) .",
    "the circular restricted three body problem ( crtbp ) models the motion of a tiny particle under the gravitational influence of one ( large ) primary mass and one ( smaller ) secondary mass both in circular orbits about their common centre of mass @xcite .",
    "hill s problem is a limit version of the crtbp which describes the motion of the particle in a neighbourhood of the secondary mass .",
    "hill s equations can be derived from the following hamiltonian in dimensionless units , @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that hill s equations have two equilibria , which are denoted traditionally by l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 , and that the matrices associated with linearising hamilton s equations about each equilibrium have a pair of real eigenvalues and two pairs of pure imaginary complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "this means that l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 are equilibria of saddle - centre - centre type .    a detailed theory for _ phase space transport _ near saddle - centre - centre equilibrium points has been developed in recent years @xcite . for energies slightly above that of the saddle - centre - centre equilibrium point ,",
    "on the @xmath4-dimensional energy surface there exists an invariant @xmath5-dimensional sphere @xmath6 of saddle stability type .",
    "this @xmath5-sphere is significant for two reasons :    * it is the `` equator '' of a @xmath7-dimensional sphere called the _",
    "transition state_. except for the equator ( which is an invariant manifold ) , the transition state is locally a `` surface of no return '' in the sense that all trajectories that start in a neighbourhood of the transition state in the energy surface must cross the transition state and exit the neighbourhood ( in the appropriate direction in time ) . for energies `` sufficiently close '' to the energy of the saddle - centre - centre equilibrium point ,",
    "the transition state satisfies the _ bottleneck property_. this means that , the energy surface _ locally _ has the geometrical structure of @xmath8 ( i.e. , 4-sphere @xmath9 interval ) and the transition state divides the energy surface into two disjoint components .",
    "moreover , the _ only _ way a trajectory can pass from one component of the energy surface to the other is to pass through the transition state . *",
    "the 3-sphere is a _ normally hyperbolic invariant manifold _",
    "@xcite ( nhim ) , which means that the expansion and contraction rates of the dynamics on the 3-sphere dominate those transverse to it . just like a `` saddle point '' it therefore has stable and unstable manifolds . in this case",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds are @xmath7-dimensional , having the structure of _ spherical cylinders _ ,",
    "hence , they are of one less dimension than the energy surface and act as `` separatrices '' ; they `` enclose '' a volume of the energy surface .",
    "their key dynamical significance is that the only way that trajectories can pass through the transition state is if they are inside the region of the energy surface enclosed by the stable and unstable spherical cylinders .",
    "these phase space structures can be realised through a procedure based on poincar - birkhoff normalisation by which explicit formulae for the nhim , its stable an unstable manifolds , and the transition state are given @xcite in `` normal form coordinates '' .",
    "the phase space structures are then mapped back into the original coordinates by the inverse of the normal form ( nf ) transformation .",
    "we will visualise the phase space structures near hill s equilibria l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 as their projections to configuration space .",
    "in understanding the result , and its implications , it is useful to recall that the level sets of the effective potential energy @xmath11 the so - called _ zero velocity surfaces _ , confine the motion in configuration space .    in figure  [",
    "fig : zvs](a ) we show the zero velocity surface ( zvs ) @xmath12 for an energy @xmath13 which is 0.1 above the energy of the equilibrium points .",
    "the zvs encloses the energetically - allowed volume of configuration space . for hill s",
    "equations its shape has two `` bottlenecks '' associated with l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 which divide the allowed volume into three regions : a bounded region about the origin ( for which @xmath14 ( a ) ) and two unbounded regions ( for which @xmath15 ( b ) and @xmath16 ( c ) , respectively ) .",
    "the phase space structures near l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 regulate the transport through the bottlenecks between these regions .",
    "the nfs about l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 are related by symmetry .",
    "it is thus sufficient to compute explicitly only the nf about l@xmath2 . as a result of the two complex eigenvalues associated with the equilibria being rationally independent ,",
    "the nf , to any desired finite order of computation , is completely integrable with integrals given by @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the nf hamiltonian can be written solely as a function of the integrals , @xmath19 , and hamilton s equations decouple into the product of independent linear systems @xmath20 the transition state 4-sphere is given by @xmath21 . from the equations of motion",
    "it is easy to see that it is a `` surface of no return '' .",
    "its equator @xmath22 is the nhim ( @xmath5-sphere ) .",
    "it has @xmath7-dimensional stable ( @xmath23 ) and unstable ( @xmath24 manifolds . in the energy surface volume enclosed by the stable and unstable manifolds",
    "@xmath25 is positive ; outside @xmath25 is negative .",
    "the nhim has a special structure .",
    "it is _ foliated _ by a one parameter family of invariant @xmath26-tori ( the `` hopf fibration '' ) @xcite .",
    "these tori can be parametrised e.g. by the integral @xmath27 where @xmath28 is then given implicitly by energy conservation and @xmath29 .",
    "at the minimal and maximal values of @xmath27 the 2-tori degenerate to periodic orbits , the so - called `` lyapunov orbits '' .",
    "the @xmath26-tori and the periodic orbits have @xmath5-dimensional and @xmath26-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds , respectively , which are contained in the @xmath7-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of the nhim .",
    "these geometrical considerations will play an important role described below .",
    "we perform the nf computation to order 18 using the computer algebra system _ mathematica_. as a result the nf hamiltonian is a sum over @xmath30 multivariate monomials in @xmath31 .",
    "each component of the mapping between nf coordinates and the original phase space coordinates involves sums over about @xmath32 multivariate monomials .",
    "the resulting transition state and nhim are shown in figure  [ fig : zvs](b ) .",
    "notice that the transition state completely blocks the `` bottleneck '' in the zvs in configuration space ; it also blocks the bottleneck in the level set of the hamiltonian in phase space .",
    "the `` saddle integral '' , @xmath17 , plays the key role in our numerical approach to detecting orbits connecting the same nhim , or orbits connecting different nhims . taking into account the hopf fibration of the nhim",
    "our procedure consists of the following four steps :    * in the nf coordinates , choose an invariant @xmath26-torus on the nhim and seed a mesh covering the torus with initial conditions . displace these initial conditions slightly in the direction of the unstable manifold of this torus ( @xmath33 ) . *",
    "map the initial conditions back into the original coordinates using the nf transformation . *",
    "integrate the initial conditions forward in time using hill s equations .",
    "since they are in the unstable manifold they will leave the neighbourhood in which the nf transformation is valid ( which is why we integrated them in the original coordinates ) . * check if a trajectory returns to the neighbourhood of l@xmath2 or l@xmath3 where the nf is valid .",
    "if so , map it into the nf coordinates and check the value of its saddle integral .",
    "if the saddle integral is zero , the trajectory must be on the stable manifold of the respective nhim ( since the trajectory is already on the unstable manifold and two unstable manifolds can not intersect ) .",
    "the procedure can be understood as a shooting method between the @xmath25-fibres of the locally valid nfs .",
    "we apply the method to hill s problem by displacing ( with @xmath34 ) meshes of initial conditions on invariant 2-tori of the nhim near l@xmath2 along the respective unstable manifold branches which are directed towards the bounded region about the origin , see figure  [ fig : zvs ] .",
    "these initial conditions are propagated by integrating hill s equations where the singularity at the origin is taken care of by the kustaanheimo - stiefel regularisation .",
    "if the resulting trajectory reenters or enters the neighbourhood of validity of the nf about l@xmath2 or l@xmath3 , respectively , we check the value of the integral @xmath25 .",
    "a positive @xmath25 means that the trajectory will cross the respective transition state which leads to an exit to the outside of the bounded region about the origin . in this case",
    "the integration is stopped .",
    "a negative value of @xmath25 means that the trajectory does not exit on this approach of l@xmath2 or l@xmath3 and the integration is continued until the trajectory reaches a validity neighbourhood of the nf with positive @xmath35 .",
    "it is to be noted that along the part of a trajectory which traverses the validity neighbourhood of the nf the values of the integrals @xmath31 are conserved to 12 digits and more , demonstrating the high accuracy of the nf .",
    "we illustrate the results in figure  [ fig : hopf ] where contours of the integral @xmath36 ( light blue / dark blue ; exit through the transition state near l@xmath2 ) and @xmath37 ( yellow / red ; exit through the transition state near l@xmath3 ) are shown plotted on the corresponding torus of the nhim . at the boundary of a light blue / dark blue region @xmath36",
    "goes to zero and points on the boundary correspond to homoclinic orbits which connect the nhim near l@xmath2 to itself .",
    "similarly , boundaries of yellow / red regions represent heteroclinic connections between the nhims near l@xmath2 and l@xmath3 .",
    "though the individual regions in figure  [ fig : hopf ] themselves are regular in the sense that they each have a smooth boundary , the disposition of the regions is very intricate .",
    "we illustrate this for initial conditions on the 2-dimensional unstable manifold of the lyapunov periodic orbit near l@xmath2 which has @xmath38 and in configuration space lies in the @xmath39-plane , see figure  [ fig : lyapunov ] . between each two arcs which extend from two consecutive zeros of @xmath25 as a function of the angle conjugate to @xmath27",
    "there is an infinity of further arcs .",
    "each zero represents an orbit which in time is backward asymptotic to the lyapunov periodic orbit and forward asymptotic to the nhim near l@xmath2 ( blue ) or the nhim near l@xmath3 ( red ) .",
    "the result is a self - similar structure well known from classical scattering systems .",
    "while orbits homoclinic to normally hyperbolic invariant tori have been studied ( @xcite ) , tori _ can not _ be normally hyperbolic in _ hamiltonian _ systems @xcite .",
    "the nhim is normally hyperbolic , yet there are no theorems describing the dynamics associated with orbits homoclinic to a normally hyperbolic invariant sphere ( part of the difficulty here comes from the fact that a sphere can not be described by a single coordinate chart , but see @xcite for numerical evidence that this could be an important mechanism for chaos ) .",
    "an important piece of this problem has recently been solved by cresson @xcite who proved that if the stable and unstable manifolds of a torus in the nhim intersect transversely , then there exists a ( uniformly ) hyperbolic invariant cantor set on which the dynamics is conjugate to a shift map , i.e. , a _ chaotic saddle_. the stable and unstable manifolds of a @xmath26-torus are @xmath5-dimensional in the @xmath4-dimensional energy surface .",
    "a transverse intersection is necessarily @xmath40-dimensional , i.e. , a trajectory .",
    "when the effect of the neglected terms in the normal form expansion ( i.e. , the non - normalised `` tail '' of the expansion ) are included we expect , by kam theory , that a cantor set of non - resonant tori in the hopf fibration will persist .",
    "homoclinic intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of a given 2-torus ( rather than more general connections between the manifolds of such a torus and those of the entire nhim ) can be detected easily by our numerical procedure described above .",
    "we therefore not only check the value the integral @xmath25 upon entering the neighbourhood of validity of the same nf that we started from , but also the difference between the centre integral @xmath27 of the 2-torus we started from and the centre integral @xmath41 in the entered validity neighbourhood .",
    "if both @xmath42 and @xmath25 vanish we have a homoclinic orbit to the 2-torus under consideration .",
    "the result of such a procedure is shown in figure  [ fig : homorbit](a ) where homoclinic connections appear as the intersection points of the zero contours of @xmath42 ( sharp boundaries between dark blue and light blue within the blue regions ) and those of @xmath25 ( boundaries of the blue regions themselves ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : homorbit](b ) shows the example of a homoclinic orbit which corresponds to one of the prominent intersection points marked by a white dot in the figure .",
    "in fact there are many more intersection points located in the finer structures of figure  [ fig : homorbit](a ) .",
    "there is a tendency that the homoclinic orbits become more complicated in the finer regions .",
    "in this letter we have described a numerical method for detecting a cantor set of chaotic saddles in hamiltonian systems with three dof .",
    "we have illustrated it for the spatial hill s problem .",
    "the implications for this problem should be of current interest in celestial mechanics . recently it has been shown that chaos plays an important role in the energetics of capture @xcite , and this cantor set of chaotic saddles should be central to this process .",
    "chaotic scattering in systems with three or more dof is poorly understood , and our results and methods should provide a window into this subject . towards this end ,",
    "our methods detect the chaotic saddles by detecting appropriate homoclinic orbits .",
    "concerning transition state theory , as described by truhlar @xcite , there are two types of trajectories that exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state : local and global .",
    "as described in the introduction , the correct choice of transition state solves the local recrossing problem .",
    "however , characterising the global recrossing problem , i.e. the question of whether there are trajectories , which , after crossing the transition state and leaving its neighbourhood , return to the transition state and cross it again , is more difficult . under additional assumptions on the geometry of the homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits , the chaotic saddles consist of trajectories that enter and leave a neigborhood of the transition state , recrossing it infinitely often .",
    "this will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "it would also be of some interest to actually compute and visualise the chaotic saddles themselves . a recently developed numerical method @xcite may play a role for this purpose .",
    "finally , we remark that our results are not limited to 3 dof .",
    "the general theory developed in @xcite applies to hamiltonian systems with arbitrary dof .",
    "the numerical method generalises easily since the saddle integral is a _ scalar _ function regardless of the number of dof .",
