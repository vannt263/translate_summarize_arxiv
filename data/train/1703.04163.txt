    "the solutions of the five - dimensional gauged supergravity models play a central role in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , @xcite , providing a dual description of strongly - coupled conformal field theories ( cfts ) on the four - dimensional boundary of five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .    in the minimal case ,",
    "the bosonic sector of the gauged supergravity model consists only of the graviton and an abelian vector field .",
    "however , despite its simplicity , constructing solutions of this theory is a nontrivial task , since the known generation techniques do not work in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "thus one has to resort to trial and error or to numerical calculations , starting from an appropriate ansatz . restricting to stationary solutions approaching asymptotically a globally ads@xmath0 spacetime ,",
    "one notes that the problem greatly simplifies for the special case where the two independent angular momenta of the generic configurations are set equal .",
    "this factorizes the dependence on the angular coordinates , leading to a cohomogeneity-1 problem , with ordinary differential equations .",
    "subject to these assumptions , a general black hole ( bh ) solution has been found in closed form in @xcite , @xcite by cveti , l and pope ( clp ) .",
    "this solution is characterized by three non - trivial parameters , namely the mass , the electric charge , and one independent angular momentum .",
    "these parameters are subject to some constraints , such that closed timelike curves and naked singularities are avoided .",
    "moreover , the clp solution possesses an extremal limit which preserves some amount of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "a simple inspection of the bh in @xcite shows that it does not possess a globally regular solitonic limit which could be viewed as a deformation of the ads background , while the magnetic field vanishes asymptotically .",
    "however , a number of recent studies @xcite-@xcite have provided evidence that the previously known solutions of the einstein - maxwell system in a globally ads@xmath1 background , represent only ` the tip of the iceberg ' , being in some sense the ads counterparts of the ( well - known ) minkowski spacetime bhs .",
    "a variety of new configurations were shown to exist .",
    "in strong contrast to the asymptotically flat case , this includes particle - like solitonic configurations @xcite , @xcite and even bhs with no spatial isometries @xcite . their existence can be traced back to the `` box''-like behavior of the ads spacetime , which allows the existence of electric ( or magnetic ) multipoles , as test fields , which are everywhere regular .    however , this `` box''-like behavior is not specific to ads@xmath1 spacetime .",
    "it has been shown recently that cohomogeneity-1 solutions of einstein - maxwell theory in odd @xmath2 dimensions can be obtained with a non - vanishing magnetic field at the ads@xmath3 boundary @xcite .",
    "these represent new families of @xmath4 solitons and black holes with rather different properties as compared to the well - known reissner - nordstrm - ads solutions .",
    "this result suggests that similar solutions should exist also for @xmath5 dimensions within the minimal gauged supergravity model .",
    "however , the einstein - maxwell - chern - simons case is more complex ; apart from the absence of the electric - magnetic duality , we note that the solutions with a magnetic field necessarily rotate and also that the sign of the electric charge becomes relevant @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the results of a preliminary investigation in this direction , by focusing on the simplest case of configurations with equal magnitude angular momenta .",
    "the new solutions reported here provide an extension of the clp bhs which contains an additional parameter associated with the magnitude of the magnetic potential at infinity .",
    "our results show the existence of a variety of new properties of the solutions .",
    "for example , the bhs possess a nontrivial particle - like limit describing charged rotating solitons .",
    "also , one finds solutions which rotate locally but have vanishing total angular momentum .",

    "however , @xmath13 will be kept general in all relations below , ( such that ( [ emcsac ] ) will describe a generic einstein ",
    "maxwell  chern - simons ( emcs ) model ) , although the numerical results will cover the sugra case only .",

    "the field equations of this model consist of the einstein equations @xmath22 together with the maxwell  chern - simons ( mcs ) equations @xmath23      before approaching the full model , it is interesting to consider the probe limit , @xmath24 a u(1 ) field in a fixed ads spacetime with a line - element @xmath25 in the above line element , the ( round ) @xmath26 sphere is written as an @xmath27-fibration over @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the left invariant one - forms , @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 also , the coordinates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the euler angles on @xmath26 , with the usual range .",

    "also , one can show that both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are nodeless functions .",
    "other properties of the mcs solutions are similar to those of their gravitating generalizations discussed in section 3 .",
    "moreover , rather similar configurations are found when considering instead a schwarzschild - ads bh background .",
    "when taking into account the backreaction on the geometry , the solutions above should result in emcs solitons and bhs .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that no analytical techniques can be used to construct these solutions in closed form ) .",
    "an approximate form of the static solitons ( @xmath56 ) can be constructed there by considering a perturbative expansion of the solutions in terms of the parameter @xmath43 . ] . as such ,",
    "in this work we approach this problem by solving the emcs equations numerically , subject to a set of boundary conditions compatible with an approximate expansion at the boundaries of the domain of integration .",
    "the corresponding metric ansatz is found by supplementing ( [ ads ] ) with four undetermined functions which take into account the deformation of the ads background and factorize the angular dependence allowing for configurations with two equal angular momenta @xmath57 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the gauge field ansatz kaluza - klein theory .",
    "however , the properties of those solutions are very different . ] is still given by ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "this framework can be proven to be consistent , and , as a result , the emcs equations reduce to a set of six second order ordinary differential equations plus a first order constraint equation , whose expression can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "also , these equations possess two first integrals @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are two constants .",
    "in deriving the far field expression of the solutions , we impose that , asymptotically , @xmath61 the geometry becomes ads in a static frame , @xmath62 the electric potential vanishes , @xmath63 ; and , as a new feature as compared to the clp case , @xmath64 the magnetic potential approaches a constant nonzero value , @xmath65 .",
    "then a far - field expression of a solution compatible with these assumptions can be constructed in a systematic way .",

    "another physically relevant parameter one can define is the r - charge , associated with the conservation of the r - current of the dual theory at the ads boundary @xcite : @xmath91 note that these three charges coincide in the absence of a boundary magnetic field , @xmath92 .",
    "also , the first integral ( [ firstint ] ) implies that @xmath93 .    in the above relations , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are parameters which enter the far field expansion ( [ inf ] ) .",
    "also , we remark that the interpretation proposed for @xmath43 in the probe limit , as a magnetic flux at infinity , still holds in the backreacting case .",

    "also , as expected , the qualitative behavior of solutions with small @xmath121 resembles that of the unmagnetized case .",
    "however , this changes for large enough values of @xmath43 and one finds @xmath125 a monotonic behavior of mass and horizon area as a function of temperature .",
    "in particular , this means that for large values of @xmath121 , the bhs become thermodynamically stable for the full range of @xmath100 , with the existence of one branch of solutions only . also , the sign of @xmath43 is relevant for small values of @xmath121 , only .",

    ", the solutions here can be viewed as the simplest ads@xmath0 generalizations of the @xmath132 einstein - maxwell solitons and bhs recently reported in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",

    "the most interesting new feature as compared to the clp case is perhaps the existence of a one parameter family of globally regular , smooth solitonic configurations .",
    "different from the previously known emcs solitons with @xmath92 which are supported by the nontrivial topology of spacetime @xcite , the solutions here can be considered as deformations of the globally ads background and require a non - vanishing magnetic field on the boundary .",

    "an interesting question here concerns the possible existence , within the proposed framework , of configurations possessing a killing spinor .",
    "however , the results in @xcite show that this is not the case : a supersymmetric solution with a nonzero boundary magnetic field is not compatible with the far field asymptotics ( [ inf ] ) , requiring a @xmath141 @xmath26 sphere at infinity .    as avenues for future research",
    ", we remark that the framework and the preliminary results proposed in this work may provide a fertile ground for the further study of charged rotating configurations in the @xmath5 gauged supergravity model . for example",
    ", it would be interesting to study in a systematic way their domain of existence , together with the extremal limit .",
    "moreover , one expects some of the solutions properties to be generic when adding scalars or taking unequal spins .",
