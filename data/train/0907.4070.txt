    "analyticity has played a key role in the development of our mathematical understanding of the nature of critical phenomena . at various levels ,",
    "the assertion of the analytic dependence of a suitable physical observable on some variable has provided a powerful starting point for theories , and its ultimate failure has informed the next step in their refinement .",
    "the first example of this was perhaps landau theory , in which the free energy @xmath0 $ ] is postulated to be analytic in the order parameter @xmath1 : @xmath2=\\int\\left((\\nabla{\\bf m})^2+{\\rm tr}({\\bf h}\\cdot{\\bf m})+r_0{\\rm tr}{\\bf m}^2+\\lambda_3{\\rm tr}{\\bf m}^3+\\cdots\\right)d^d\\!x\\,.\\ ] ] in this expression , all terms allowed by symmetry are in principal present . the requirement that @xmath1 should minimize @xmath3 , @xmath4 , implies that there are critical points ( in the mathematical sense ) at certain values of the parameters .",
    "the singular behavior close to these is described by the mathematical theory of bifurcations .",
    "the critical exponents which emerge from this analysis are super - universal in that they do not depend on the spatial dimension @xmath5 or the symmetry of the order parameter .    of course",
    ", the successes and the limitations of landau theory are well understood .",
    "it does not account for the fluctuations in the order parameter . in high enough dimensions these",
    "can usually be ignored as far as the universal behavior is concerned , but in general they should be taken into account by computing the full landau - ginzburg - wilson partition function @xmath6=\\int_{|{\\bf q}|<\\lambda}[d{\\bf m}(x)]\\,e^{-f[{\\bf m}]}\\,,\\ ] ] with a suitable cut - off @xmath7 on the short wavelength modes .",
    "this of course is impossible except in some simple cases , but these can often be used as a starting point for a perturbative expansion .",
    "however this approach generally fails near the critical point .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) of wilson , fisher and others was a way of dealing with this problem , by considering the response to changes in the cut - off @xmath8 in such a way as to move the parameters into a region where perturbation theory is applicable . requiring that the long - distance physics remains the same then leads to the rg flow equations @xmath9 for the parameters @xmath10 in @xmath0 $ ] . the critical behavior is then controlled by the fixed points where @xmath11 .",
    "one of the crucial assumptions of the rg theory is that these functions themselves are analytic in the @xmath10 near the fixed point .",
    "thus analyticity is moved to a higher level of abstraction : the non - analyticity of the free energy results from a potentially infinite number of applications of the analytic rg mapping .",
    "[ interestingly enough there is very little direct evidence for the strict validity of this assumption .",
    "it is largely based on analysis of perturbation theory which begs the question .",
    "solvable models in two dimensions have so much analytic structure built into them that analyticity of the rg flows is almost inevitable , and possible detailed violations of analyticity have not , to my knowledge , been carefully studied in numerical simulations in higher dimensions .",
    "indeed in one case , @xmath12 , when the beta - function can be evaluated analytically , it displays an essential singularity at the fixed point . ]",
    "the next example of the use of analyticity is in the solution of integrable models in two dimensions . in this case",
    "the independent variable parameterizes the solution manifold on which the boltzmann weights satisfy the yang - baxter equations .",
    "its physical interpretation , to be discussed later , is the degree of anisotropy of the model in two - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the yang - baxter equations imply that the row - to - row transfer matrices at different values of this parameter commute . assuming that the analytic properties of the local weights in the parameter lift to thermodynamic quantities , baxter and others have shown that these obey functional relations which often determine them completely .",
    "the other main approach to understanding two - dimensional critical behaviour attempts to describe the continuum critical scaling limit directly , and also exploits analyticity .",
    "this is the approach of conformal field theory ( cft ) , more recently also linked to schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the analyticity is in the two - dimensional coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in cft ,",
    "correlation functions of certain observables are holomorphic functions of @xmath15 ( or antiholomorphic functions of @xmath16 . )",
    "these observables are of two types : conserved currents corresponding to continuous symmetries , such as the stress tensor @xmath17 , or so - called parafermions @xmath18 whose 2-point correlation function in the full plane have the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the conformal spin , is in general fractional .",
    "these holomorphic ( and antiholomorphic ) objects are the building blocks of many cfts .",
    "they also give an explicit meaning to the statement of conformal covariance : if we consider the scaling limit of a critical lattice model in a domain @xmath21 , then the behavior of a multi - point holomorphic correlator is completely determined by its singular behavior at coincident points and the boundary conditions on @xmath22 .",
    "if these are themselves conformally covariant ( _ e.g .",
    "_ if @xmath23 is determined by the boundary tangent angle ) , then , under any conformal mapping @xmath24 of the interior of @xmath21 to another domain @xmath25 @xmath26 _ _    it is the purpose of this paper to review recent work which forges a link between these last two realizations of analyticity .",
    "more specifically , starting from certain lattice models we identify so - called discretely holomorphic observables , whose correlators satisfy a lattice version of the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "these have fractional spin by construction , and are presumably the lattice precursors of the parafermions in the corresponding cft .",
    "we find , as expected , that discrete holomorphicity holds only when the boltzmann weights lie on the critical manifold of the model , but , more surprisingly , that they also lie on the _ integrable _ critical manifold , that is , they satisfy the yang - baxter equations . _ _    this work has been described in detail in several papers . in @xcite a discretely holomorphic observable",
    "was identified for the random cluster representation of the @xmath27-state potts model . in @xcite",
    "several were found , directly from the boltzmann weights , for the @xmath28 clock models , and the close connection to integrability was first observed .",
    "smirnov @xcite also found such an observable for the random curve representation of the o@xmath29 model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this was extended to the o@xmath29 model , and further generalizations , on the square lattice in @xcite , where the parameter space is large enough to make clear the connection to integrability .",
    "smirnov s objective in identifying these holomorphic objects associated with curves was to show that their scaling limit in described by schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) .",
    "this approach is fully described in @xcite and we refer the reader there",
    ". suffice it to say that proving that the discretely holomorphic lattice observables go over into fully holomorphic quantities in the scaling limit is in general a very difficult problem which has been solved completely only in a few special cases , in particular that of the ising model ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) @xcite .    in this account",
    "we shall describe in detail only two examples .",
    "the first is the simplest : the case @xmath32 of the @xmath28 model , more usually known as the ising model . in this case the parafermion has conformal spin @xmath33 and is related to the fermionic objects used in the various exact solutions of the model , going back to onsager .",
    "it is defined , in a standard way , as a product of nearby order and disorder variables .",
    "this identification dates back ( at least ) to fradkin and kadanoff @xcite , but the simple argument given in @xcite that a particular lattice definition is discretely holomorphic is , to our knowledge , new .",
    "an essential ingredient in the definition of a disorder operator is that the model must possess a dual description in the sense of kramers and wannier .",
    "however , the second example is the o@xmath29 model which does not possess this . in this case",
    "the parafermionic observables are instead defined in terms of the random curve representation of the model , which is nonlocal in terms of the original spin degrees of freedom .    before proceeding , however",
    ", we give a proper definition of discrete holomorphicity .",
    "suppose @xmath34 is a planar graph embedded in @xmath35 , for example a square lattice .",
    "let @xmath36 be a complex - valued function defined at the midpoints @xmath37 of each edge @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath3 is discretely holomorphic on @xmath34 if @xmath39 where the sum is over the edges of each face @xmath40 of @xmath34 .",
    "this is a discrete version of the contour integral . for a square lattice ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "it reduces to @xmath41     is defined at the mid - points of the edges.,width=113 ]    a little thought shows , however , that the total number of such equations , one for each face of @xmath34 , is in general far less than the number of unknowns , one for each edge .",
    "therefore even on the lattice this system does not determine @xmath36 for suitable boundary conditions , unless further information is available .",
    "( for the ising model it turns out that more is known about the phase of @xmath3 , so the system is rigid . )",
    "however , in the continuum limit as the lattice spacing tends to zero , we can approximate arbitrarily closely the contour integral @xmath42 by a sum of the left - hand side of ( [ holo ] ) over faces @xmath40 which tile the interior of @xmath43 , and therefore assert that is vanishes for all reasonable contours @xmath43 .",
    "morera s theorem then assures us that _ if _ @xmath44 is continuous then it is analytic . in field theory",
    "the continuity of correlation functions is usually taken for granted , but strictly this needs to be proved . _ _",
    "the square lattice ising model has spins @xmath45 at the vertices @xmath46 .",
    "the boltzmann weights are @xmath47 with @xmath48 , where the sum is over edges @xmath49 .",
    "note that the weights can also be written + @xmath50 .",
    "the insertion of a disorder operator @xmath51 at the dual vertex @xmath52 corresponds to changing @xmath53 on all edges which cross a ` string ' attaching @xmath52 to the boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "that is @xmath54 the correlator @xmath55 corresponds to such a string connecting @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and is invariant under deformations of the string .    the parafermionic variables @xmath58 are defined on the midpoints of each edge @xmath59 connecting the vertex @xmath46 to a neighboring dual vertex @xmath52 , which form the covering lattice : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the angle that @xmath59 makes with ( say ) the positive @xmath62-axis ,",
    "but we have to be careful about its multivaluedness ( see below ) .",
    "consider now an elementary square ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .        from ( [ eq1 ] ) we have @xmath63 where we have set @xmath64 depending on whether @xmath49 is parallel to the @xmath62 or @xmath65-axis .",
    "now multiply ( [ eq2 ] ) by @xmath66 and @xmath67 and use @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to two linear equations in the four parafermionic variables defined on the edges of the square .",
    "simple algebra then shows that these imply the discrete holomorphicity condition ( [ holo ] ) as long as :    * we distort each square into a rhombus whose angle depends on the anisotropy @xmath69 ; * we are careful , since @xmath20 is in general non - integer , to define @xmath61 consistently so that it varies only by increments in the interval @xmath70 on going around the square ; * the couplings lie on the critical manifold @xmath71 .",
    "this example illustrates the general results discussed in the introduction .",
    "it also shows how the lattice should be embedded in @xmath35 so that its continuum limit is rotationally and conformally invariant .",
    "however since the nearest neighbor ising model is integrable for all values of the couplings @xmath72 , it is not general enough to illustrate the role of integrability .",
    "this is afforded by the generalization to the @xmath28 models @xcite . in these models",
    "the ising spins are generalized to complex roots of unity such that @xmath73 .",
    "the boltzmann weights take the form @xmath74 it is then found that one can identify discretely holomorphic parafermions , again the product of neighboring order and disorder operators , with spins @xmath75 as long as the parameters lie on the manifold @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "here @xmath78 is the half - angle at the vertex of the rhombus into which the square lattice must be distorted , and therefore measures the degree of anisotropy .",
    "however this manifold is precisely the critical _ integrable _ case for the general nearest neighbor @xmath28 model found by fateev and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "the values of the conformal spins above agree precisely with those of the parafermionic holomorphic conformal fields in the cft postulated by the same authors @xcite to describe the continuum limit of this model . _",
    "_    the above analysis can be generalized simply to a general graph @xmath79 whose faces are 2-colorable , sometimes called a baxter lattice ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ baxter ] .     formed by the curved lines are 2-colorable ( not shown ) . order variables",
    "@xmath20 and disorder variables @xmath80 are associated with alternately colored faces respectively .",
    "the covering lattice is shown as solid lines .",
    "the theorem of kenyon and schlenker @xcite asserts that for every such graph the covering lattice admits a rhombic embedding in the plane , that is one where all its edges have the same length.,width=226 ]    the @xmath28 spins @xmath81 are defined on the faces of a given color , and the disorder variables @xmath51 on the others .",
    "neighboring order and disorder operators then lie at the vertices of quadrilaterals which tile the plane .",
    "a theorem due to kenyon and schlenker @xcite asserts that , under rather general conditions , they can can be distorted in the plane so they are all rhombi , that is , they form an isoradial lattice , on which nearest neighbors are all the same distance apart . if now the interactions across each rhombus are chosen to satisfy ( [ eq : man ] ) , where @xmath78 is the half - angle of the rhombus , then the associated parafermion is discretely holomorphic on the isoradial lattice .",
    "moreover the corresponding weights satisfy the star - triangle , or yang - baxter equations , as explained in fig .",
    "[ startriangle ] .     as compared to that on the right .",
    "discrete holomorphicity for each rhombus fixes the couplings on the dashed lines to be related by the star - triangle transformation .",
    "the two pictures are also related in the original graph @xmath79 by moving one of the curves past the vertex formed by the other two  the yang - baxter relation.,width=302 ]    we note that although we have defined the parafermions in this case directly in terms of the modified boltzmann weights , they may also be identified with observables of random curves in the model . for the case of the ising model it is well known that the high - temperature expansion , in powers of @xmath82 , of the correlation function @xmath83 can be expressed as sum over graphs on the lattice .",
    "the argument is clearer for the honeycomb lattice , when these graphs consist of non - intersecting closed loops and one open curve @xmath84 from @xmath85 to @xmath46 .",
    "the additional complications on the square lattice are believed to be irrelevant to the scaling limit .",
    "the introduction of the disorder operator @xmath51 neighboring @xmath81 acts to weight configurations of the open curve with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of times @xmath84 crosses the string .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the winding angle of @xmath84 . in the scaling limit",
    "this takes arbitrarily large values and so it does not matter whether we compute it in increments of @xmath90 as it crosses the string , or simply in increments of @xmath91 as we proceed along @xmath84 .",
    "this latter definition corresponds to the one used by smirnov @xcite .",
    "as a second example we consider the so - called o@xmath29 model on the square lattice , first considered by nienhuis @xcite . although it can be written in terms of @xmath92-component spins @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) located on the edges of a square lattice through local , but non - nearest neighbor , interactions , it is more easily formulated in terms of a gas of dilute non - intersecting planar loops .",
    "each elementary square can take one of the configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , with the indicated weights .",
    "when patched together these curves form closed loops , each of which receives an additional weight @xmath92 , which no longer has to be an integer and may be parameterized by @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "note that we have grouped the anisotropic weights so that there is symmetry under reflections in the diagonal axes .",
    "this symmetry is preserved when the plaquettes are deformed into rhombi .",
    "since every loop configuration has an even number of plaquettes of type @xmath97 or @xmath98 , the change @xmath99 does not affect the boltzmann weights .    in order to define a suitable candidate for the parafermionic observable",
    "we must consider not only closed loops but also open curves which begin and end at different points , say @xmath85 and @xmath46 .",
    "such configurations arise , as in the previous section , if we compute the correlator @xmath100 of the o@xmath29 spins . once again , to define an object with non - zero spin , we additionally weight each open curve by a phase factor @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the winding angle from @xmath85 to @xmath46 , the accumulation of the turns through @xmath91 . note that this can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this type of observable for the o@xmath29 model was first considered on the honeycomb lattice by smirnov @xcite .",
    "now consider the contributions to the holomorphicity equation ( [ holo ] ) where @xmath46 is one of the edges of an elementary square .",
    "since the open curve ends at @xmath46 , it must first intersect the square on some edge @xmath101 ( not necessarily the same as @xmath46 ) .",
    "the configurations can then be decomposed according to the different possible @xmath101 . without loss of generality",
    "we take it to be on the lower edge in fig .",
    "the configurations can then be further decomposed into classes corresponding to the various cases shown in this figure . in the last three cases a curve connects two of the other edges",
    ": it may be part of a closed loop or of the open curve .",
    "the idea is to sum over all possible ways of connecting up the curves internally through the square , keeping the external configuration fixed , and to try to satisfy ( [ holo ] ) for _ each _ of these configurations .",
    "this can be done , and yields the following linear system for the weights : @xmath102 where we have set @xmath103 . for real weights , ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] ) are four complex linear equations for six real unknowns + @xmath104 , and we have the relations : @xmath105 & = & 0 \\\\     { \\rm im}\\ \\left [      \\lambda \\mu^{-1 } ( \\lambda^2-n \\lambda^{-2 } ) \\",

    "\\{\\ref{eq : syst - on4}\\ }    \\right ] & = & 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we can generally reduce ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] ) to a @xmath106 real system .",
    "_ _     connected to point @xmath85 .",
    "]    there are two classes of solutions , for vanishing and non - vanishing @xmath107 .",
    "first , if @xmath108 , then the configurations corresponding to \\{[eq : syst - on4 ] } never occur , and so this equation does not hold . in the special case @xmath31 ,",
    "there exists a non - trival solution _ for any value of @xmath20 _ :",
    "@xmath109 it turns out @xcite that this model can be mapped onto the six - vertex model ( see figure  [ fig : on-6v ] ) , with weights @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding anisotropy parameter is @xmath111 .",
    "this is an example of a model admitting a holomorphic observable on the lattice , but for which the scaling limit of the corresponding curve _ can not _ be described by simple sle .",
    "this is because , for ordinary sle , the central charge of the cft is directly related to the sle parameter @xmath112 @xcite and hence to the conformal spin @xmath20 : @xmath113 . in the present case ,",
    "since the boundary conditions for the six - vertex model are not twisted , its scaling limit has central charge @xmath114 for all @xmath115 .",
    "however the conformal spin @xmath20 varies continuously with @xmath115",
    ". therefore the scaling limit of the curve can be sle , with @xmath116 , for at most one value ( in fact @xmath117 . )",
    "we conjecture that other values of @xmath115 in fact correspond to a variant of sle called sle@xmath118 . _ _    for @xmath119 , we get a @xmath120 linear system , with determinant @xmath121 . imposing @xmath122 yields @xmath123 and in turn @xmath124 , where @xmath125 are integers .",
    "thus , for the solution to exist at any value of @xmath78 , we have to set @xmath126 .",
    "the boltzmann weights are then : @xmath127 the solution of the case @xmath128 is similar , and leads to the same boltzmann weights and spin @xmath126 .",
    "if we change the sign of @xmath129 , then the model ( [ eq : n+1 ] ) is equivalent to a dense loop model which corresponds to the critical @xmath27-state potts model , with weight per loop @xmath130 . to see this ,",
    "fill empty spaces with loops of weight @xmath131 ( _ ghost loops _ ) .",
    "the local weights do not depend on the type of loops involved ( actual or ghost loops ) , so each loop has an overall weight @xmath132 . as a consequence , the dense loop model has a lattice antiholomorphic observable ( @xmath133 ) , besides the holomorphic one found in  @xcite .",
    "however , several arguments rule out the hypothesis that this corresponds to an antiholomorphic field in the continuum limit .",
    "first , @xmath134 is lattice antiholomorphic for any @xmath135 , whereas it is well known that the self - dual potts model is only critical for @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath137 in [ eq : n+1 ] does not depend on the angle @xmath78 , which means that the same model has an antiholomorphic observable for any deformation angle : this is not acceptable physically in the continuum limit .",
    "so we conclude that , in the case @xmath108 and generic @xmath138 , the holomorphicity conditions ( [ holo ] ) for the dilute o@xmath29 model merely lead to the case of the dense loop model , but the corresponding @xmath18 is not a candidate for an antiholomorphic field in the continuum limit .",
    "let us now discuss the solutions of second class ( @xmath139 ) , for a generic value of @xmath92 .",
    "we get the @xmath106 real system : @xmath140 with determinant : @xmath141 .",
    "non - trivial solutions exist if the spin satisfies : @xmath142 the various solutions to [ eq : s - on1 ] can be parameterized by extending the range of @xmath143 to @xmath144 $ ] , and setting : @xmath145 then , we get the second class of solutions , with boltzmann weights : @xmath146 a remarkable fact is that the weights ( [ bw1][bw6 ] ) are a solution of the yang - baxter equations for the o@xmath29 loop model on the square lattice . indeed ,",
    "after a change of variables @xmath147 , they coincide with the integrable weights in  @xcite .",
    "so , by solving the holomorphicity equations  ( [ eq : syst - on1][eq : syst - on4 ] ) on a deformed lattice , we recover the integrable weights .",
    "other more complicated loops models ( for example one with different types of loops known as the c2(1 ) model @xcite ) can also be studied with similar results @xcite .",
    "we have given two main examples of lattice models , the @xmath28 model and the o@xmath29 model on a square lattice , in which observables can be identified whose correlators are discretely holomorphic , as long as the weights are both critical and satisfy the yang - baxter relations .",
    "this is surprising , since the holomorphicity conditions are linear in the weights , and work for a fixed value of the anisotropy parameter , while the yang - baxter relations are cubic functional equations for the weights .",
    "while in the case of the @xmath28 models the connection to integrability may be understood by generalizing the problem to an inhomogeneous baxter lattice , this explanation is at present missing for the loop models . while it would be nice to elevate these observations to a more general result connecting holomorphicity , integrability and conformal field theory , the counter - example given in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] in which a lattice holomorphic observable apparently does not correspond to a conformal field should warn us that there may be subtleties .",
    "for the @xmath28 models for larger values of @xmath87 , problems in a lattice identification of the value of the conformal spin @xmath20 were also noted in @xcite .",
    "although it is to be hoped that the results of smirnov @xcite in using these holomorphic observables to prove that the scaling limit of lattice curves is given by sle can be extended to other models , the examples we have given which correspond to cfts with central charge @xmath148 show that this may not always be the case .",

    "<S> these are objects whose correlation functions satisfy a discrete version of the cauchy - riemann relations . </S>",
    "<S> their existence appears to have a deep relation with the integrability of the model , and they are presumably the lattice versions of the truly holomorphic observables appearing in the conformal field theory ( cft ) describing the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis sheds light on the connection between cft and integrability , and , if verified , can also be used to prove that the scaling limit of certain discrete curves in these models is described by schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) . </S>"
