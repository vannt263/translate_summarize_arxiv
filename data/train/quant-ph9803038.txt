    "the recent experimental realization of bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold atomic gases , @xcite has triggered the theoretical exploration of the properties of bose gases .",
    "specifically there has been a great interest in the developement of applications which make use of the properties of this new state of matter . perhaps , the recent development of the so  called atom laser @xcite is the best example of the interest of these applications .",
    "the current model used to describe a system with a fixed mean number @xmath0 of weakly interacting bosons , trapped in a parabolic potential @xmath1 is the following nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) ( which in this context is called the gross  pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) ) @xmath2 which is valid when the particle density and temperature of the condensate are small enough . here",
    "@xmath3 characterizes the interaction and is defined in terms of the ground state scattering length @xmath4 .",
    "the normalization for @xmath5 is @xmath6 and the trapping potential is given by    @xmath7    @xmath8 being , as usual , constants describing the anisotropies of the trap @xcite . in real experimental systems",
    "the geometry of the trap imposes the condition @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the quotient between the frequency along the @xmath11-direction @xmath12 and the radial one @xmath13 .",
    "( [ pura ] ) is strictly valid in the @xmath14 and low density limit , but has been validated by different ways for the current experimental systems , e.g. by the comparison of the experimental @xcite and theoretical low energy excitation spectra of the condensates @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work extends the applicability of the gpe to the high density limit @xcite .    when @xmath15 the interaction between the particles in the condensate is repulsive , as in most current bec experiments @xcite . in opposite case ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the interaction is attractive @xcite .",
    "although the gpe is widely accepted as a valid model for the dynamics of the bec at @xmath17 k , the knowledge of the dynamics of the condensates is scarce since the gpe is non - integrable and explicit solutions are not known . in the positive scattering length case",
    "( [ pura ] ) has been solved numerically for cylindrically symmetric systems and analytically some work has been done in the framework of the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . the negative scattering length case is mostly unexplored except some numerical results @xcite .",
    "other approach to the dynamics of the condensate is the time dependent variational technique @xcite which assumes a fixed profile and computes the evolution of some parameters such as the width , etc .",
    ", by variational techniques    an important fact related to negative scattering length condensates is that stable solutions to eq .",
    "( [ pura ] ) exist only under certain conditions on the number of particles and the size of the trap @xcite .",
    "when those conditions are not satisfied the condensate is unstable and destroyed by the collapse phenomenon because the density @xmath18 increases up to a point where nonlinear losses ( not included in eq .",
    "( [ pura ] ) ) become dominant .",
    "so , to have a _ large _ stable negative scattering length condensate collapse must be avoided .",
    "having larger condensates is important to get better experimental observations of bec .",
    "the reason the critical number of particles that can be put in the condensate without collapse is very small for current experimental parameters and thus , it is difficult to perform accurate measurements and to obtain experimental data of the condensation process .",
    "other reason for the interest of large condensates is their future practical applications ( atom interferometers , atom clocks , etc . ) , where coherent atom clouds as large as possible are necessary .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of negative scattering length condensates in cigar - shaped traps .",
    "we present a new class of soliton  like stable solutions which can be of interest in the applications of these coherent atom aggregates .",
    "from now on we will study the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ pura ] ) in cylindrically symmetric parabolic traps ( [ parabolic ] ) .",
    "more explicitly we will consider cigar  like condensates , i.e. , the case in which the trapping potential in @xmath19 is much weaker than the trapping potential in @xmath20 ; mathematically @xmath21 .",
    "let us make the change of variables : @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the size of the ground state solution of the noninteracting gpe with a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath25 ( except for a @xmath26 factor ) .",
    "let us also define a new wavefunction as @xmath27 , then equation ( @xmath28 ) reads    @xmath29 u,\\ ] ]    with the normalization condition @xmath30 .",
    "the solution of this nonlinear partial differential equation is a challenging problem and no explicit solutions are known .",
    "however due to the different interaction scales involved in our particular problem it is possible to find approximate ( but very accurate ) analytic forms for the ground state solutions of eq .",
    "( [ nls3 ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis using multiscale expansions is done in the appendix . here",
    "we will derive the ground state solution by simple physical arguments .",
    "we will first assume that it is possible factor the solution of eq .",
    "( [ nls3 ] ) as @xmath31 then , @xmath32 satisfies the following equation @xmath33 eq .",
    "( [ prima ] ) is a well - known eigenvalue problem , the two dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator .",
    "its _ ground state _",
    "solution is @xmath34 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ nls3 ] ) by @xmath35 and integrating to eliminate the @xmath20 dependence we find @xmath36 where the additional factor @xmath37 in the nonlinear term comes from the quotient @xmath38 .",
    "finally , let us make the change @xmath39 to obtain @xmath40 this equation is a 1-dimensional nlse , that in the @xmath41 case can be integrated by the inverse scattering technique @xcite . when @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ nls2 ] ) has stationary normalized single - soliton solutions of type @xmath42 from here and using the galilean invariance of the 1d - nlse it is possible to find travelling soliton solutions that propagate without distortion .    the width of the cloud in the @xmath19 direction is related to the nonlinear coefficient through the relation @xmath43 this fact is remarkable and means that condensates with a small number of particles ( @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath0 ) would be very long , while condensates with more particles would be shorter . if the number of particles is large enough the condensate is unstable and collapse occurs .    to justify approximation ( [ factor ] )",
    "let us note that in the transverse direction the trapping potential and nonlinear force tend to compress the wavepacket competing against the linear dispersion effect provided by the kinetic energy term .",
    "on the other hand the trapping force in the @xmath19-direction has been removed so that along that axis there is only a competition between the nonlinear attraction and the dispersion . when the main force on the transverse direction is the one caused by the trapping potential the approximation will be justified . to check it",
    "let us compare both potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the soliton solution .",
    "their ratio is a function @xmath47 given by @xmath48 since @xmath49 , evidently when @xmath50 then @xmath51 except for very small values of @xmath20 .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , the parabolic potential dominates over the self - interaction , and then the only effect of the nonlinear term on the transverse shape is to provide small shape corrections near the center of the trap , which is the place where the parabolic potential is lower and the nonlinear term more relevant .    to see whether the soliton solutions really exist",
    "we have computed numerically the ground state solution of ( [ nls3 ] ) for different values of @xmath52 . in the non interacting limit ( small @xmath44 ) the solution",
    "is given by @xmath53 decreasing @xmath52 and increasing @xmath44 preserving also the condition @xmath51 we should obtain the soliton solutions ( [ soliton1 ] ) . to compute the ground state solutions we have used the steepest descent method described in @xcite to minimize the hamiltonian @xmath54\\ ] ] over a discrete lattice , where the solution is defined . in fig .",
    "1 we plot sections of the fundamental state @xmath55 for different values of the trapping potential in @xmath19 ( parametrized by the value of @xmath52 ) and @xmath56 .",
    "as the @xmath52 value decreases the solutions get wider , but when @xmath57 the solutions do not widen indefinitely .",
    "the profile is then very close to the one defined by eq .",
    "( [ soliton1 ] ) , while the transverse profile is gaussian as eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) predicted .",
    "for @xmath58 it is seen in fig .",
    "2 that the @xmath41 solutions are not so close to the profiles predicted by eq .",
    "( [ soliton1 ] ) .",
    "this is because when @xmath44 is large the approximation involved in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ soliton1 ] ) is not valid and the nonlinear energy term is comparable to the transverse harmonic trapping energy .",
    "however , it is striking that even for this large @xmath44 case the differences between the numerically calculated profile and the solitonic profile are less than 10% . in this case",
    "it is seen that compact solutions exist when the trapping in @xmath11 is absent .    on the other hand , when a strong trapping potential is applied in the @xmath19-direction ( stronger than the nonlinear self - interaction term )",
    "the numerical solution is close to the exact gaussian ground state solution ( [ gaussian ] ) , and the effect of the nonlinear term is only an enhanced compression of the solution near the center of the trap .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in fig . 1 ( plot with @xmath59 ) .    the existence of atomic solitons has been put forward in @xcite in the context of the motion of an atom beam in the field of a travelling wave laser and in a similar context in @xcite . in those papers",
    "however the trap effect was not considered and the validity of the transition to 1-d equations was not studied .",
    "thus , we have numerically established the existence of localized solutions and obtained their analytical form when the trapping in @xmath19 is eliminated ( provided the number of particles @xmath60 is small enough to avoid collapse ) .",
    "also there exist travelling solutions of this type that could propagate without distortion .",
    "now it is interesting to study the response of the center of mass of the condensate to an external potential to because it could allow to control the motion of the condensate .",
    "let us then study the evolution of the center of mass of a condensate governed by eq .",
    "( [ pura ] ) in an _ arbitrary _ external potential @xmath61 ( the following results are valid for any potential not only for _ parabolic traps _ ) .",
    "defining @xmath62 and computing its time derivatives using eq .",
    "( [ pura ] ) we find @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the usual momentum operator , @xmath65 and @xmath66 which is the ehrenfest theorem of quantum mechanics .",
    "( [ ehr ] ) means that this theorem is still valid for the gpe so that the center of mass of the wavepacket behaves like a classical particle .",
    "it is possible to check the validity of ( [ ehr ] ) for more general nls equations ( i.e. , more general nonlinear terms ) , a fact which is not well  known @xcite .",
    "this result implies that one could manipulate a condensate by using an external potential as is known for the 1d - nlse @xcite . joining this result with the previous one , i.e. , the existence of localized solutions",
    ", we find a way to control the motion of a negative scattering length condensate : just relax the trap in one direction and apply an external force along that axis , the condensate will respond by preserving its shape and moving like a classical particle . of course the external force should be smoothly varying since the localized solutions have been derived in the limit where no forces are present @xcite .",
    "it is not strictly true that a condensate would respond as a whole to the external force .",
    "it is well known @xcite that any initial data evolving following ( [ nls2 ] ) decomposes into solitons and  radiation \" .",
    "so , it should be simple to find experimentally these solitonic objects by just adiabatically relaxing the trap and applying an external potential .",
    "doing so radiation ( which in these context means some free atoms ) would be generated and some solitons obtained .",
    "only if the initial data is already a soliton there would not be a breaking of the initial data into a soliton train plus radiation .    concerning the motion of a soliton wavepacket in a highly asymmetric trap ( with @xmath52 small but different from zero ) it",
    "must be said that there are no completely stationary solutions as shown by @xcite .",
    "however there would be a quasi - stationary solution with gaussian tails in the @xmath67 and near - sech profile in the @xmath68 region as recently proposed in @xcite . if the number of particles is large enough so that the soliton size is small compared with the scale of variation of the potential it will be expected a smooth motion of the  soliton \" towards the  boundary \" .",
    "however , if the soliton size and trap size are of the same order of magnitude there will be a competition of both scales which can result in cuasiperiodic motion or even into chaotic motion as discussed in @xcite .    another  tool \" to control the motion of the condensate could be a laser field as has been put forward in @xcite but in those cases the interaction between the trasverse laser field and the atoms should be carefully considered .",
    "let us analyze the relevance of our results for the lithium bose ",
    "einstein condensates @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite we will take as parameters @xmath69 and the usual trapping potentials for the cigar - trap that are about @xmath70 hz corresponding to @xmath71 m .    to ensure the validity of eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) it is necessary that @xmath72 and then we find that @xmath73 .",
    "however in fig .",
    "2 it is seen how even in the case @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) the differences between the soliton profile and the real ground state are small .",
    "another interesting limit corresponds to collapse . in principle",
    "one would expect that the cigar  like trap would allow a larger number of particles to be put before collapse occurs .",
    "the physical reason is that keeping free the condensate in one spatial direction collapse would not occur along that axis but through compression of the orthogonal ( transverse ) directions , which are smaller and thus ` feel ' stronger interactions .",
    "this means that the system would behave in a two - dimensional like manner and then the collapse conditions should be less severe @xcite .    to test this hypothesis",
    "we have performed simulations of the largest @xmath44 value allowed using the same code as for the computation of the ground state .",
    "the upper limit found for the cigar - like trap is @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "this number is somewhat lower than the gaussian bound given in @xcite which is @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath79 .",
    "these numbers compare favourably with the spherically symmetric results . in that case",
    "the limit found using the steepest descent method is @xmath80 corresponding to about @xmath81 , again lower than the gaussian bound @xmath82 and then @xmath83 . so the cigar - like trap allows to increase the maximum number of particles by 25% .",
    "this is a small but significant increase .",
    "we have cheked by numerical solution of the gaussian equations of ref .",
    "@xcite and numerical simulations of ( [ nls3 ] ) that the cigar trap is the optimal one ; i.e. there is no another parabolic trap configuration with better collapse - avoiding properties .",
    "as stated in the introduction one would like to increase the number of particles in the condensate as much as possible .",
    "this would allow the control of a large coherent pulse of atoms .",
    "to do so one could try to use a higher order soliton @xcite . however , for those solutions the shape performs complicated ( but periodic ) oscillations and develops high spatial and temporal gradients that probably would rule out the approximation and induce collapse if the order of the soliton is large enough .",
    "it is also possible to generate a soliton train where the solitons have different global phases so that the interaction between them is repulsive .",
    "this idea should work for some situations allowing many particles to be put in the ground state and will be elaborated in future work .",
    "other possibility is to use a non  gaussian fundamental mode for the transverse solution as in @xcite .",
    "however the question of the stability of those solutions under general three - dimensional perturbations is not trivial and is the subject of current research .",
    "finally , other possibilities proposed in the literature could be of use here such as using two condensates @xcite or the control of the value of the scattering length @xcite .",
    "we have found compact solutions of ( [ nls3 ] ) that exist due to nonlinear effects even when the @xmath11 trapping potential is absent . joining this result with ( [ ehr ] )",
    "we conclude that it is possible to control the motion of the condensate , which could propagate without distortion by using smoothly varying external potentials .",
    "thus , the atom cloud could be manipulated very easily , e.g. , with an atom guide .",
    "it is interesting and curious that this cigar - like packet could be transported in that rigid way behaving like a quasiparticle .",
    "this behavior is specific of negative scattering length condensates and an advantage over the positive scattering length ones , which tend to fill all the available space due to the repulsive atom - atom interaction .",
    "additionally we have pointed out that relaxing the trapping potential in one direction in current traps would allow to increase the number of particles that can be put into a negative scattering length condensate .",
    "we hope that this study will stimulate the experimental efforts in performing bec with negative scattering length and think that the soliton solutions here studied will be of practical applicability in bose - einstein condensate  engineering \" .",

    "here we will give the details of a more formal derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ prima ] ) and ( [ nls2 ] ) from ( [ nls3 ] ) using multiple scale analysis @xcite .",
    "let us first choose the      this scaling satisfies the desiderable property that the @xmath85 norm of @xmath86 is conserved and that the potential in @xmath11 is weaker than the nonlinear interaction ( and the later weaker than the trasverse potential ) when @xmath87 . inserting ( [ scaling ] ) into eq .",

    "ii . joining the longitudinal and the trasverse solution and changing back to the nonscaled variables we find that the ground state solution has the form @xmath96 at least to the first order in @xmath97 .",

    "it is easy to see that the equations have solutions @xmath98 , so the solution is determined at least to order @xmath99 by @xmath92 .",
