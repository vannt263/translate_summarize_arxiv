    "while most of the geological evidence about the evolution of our solar system has been erased by cataclysmic events , we can study the evolution of stellar systems like our own by observing circumstellar debris disks around solar - type ( f , g , and k type ) stars .",
    "much work has been done to observe and characterize debris disks ( e.g. bryden et al .",
    "2006 ) , but it has been notoriously complicated to track the evolution of these disks .",
    "the root of the problem is the difficulty in determining stellar age .",
    "while the ages of clusters and associations can be determined by their bulk properties ( i.e. hr diagrams ) , such techniques are not useful for isolated field stars .",
    "because of the difficulty of stellar age - dating , the study of debris disk evolution has been largely constrained to a - type stars ( su et al .",
    "2006 , rieke et al .",
    "since a - type stars evolve quickly on the main sequence , their ages can be estimated from stellar isochrones .",
    "( 2006 ) found that dust around a - type stars declines with age as t@xmath2/t , where t@xmath2=150 myr .",
    "isochrone dating is not adequate for solar type stars , however , since they evolve slowly on the main sequence .",
    "it is important to extend the study of debris disk evolution to solar - type stars , since they offer the best evidence about the evolution of our own solar system .",
    "chromospheric activity dating has a well - calibrated age relation , and carries smaller errors than isochrone dating ( mamajek @xmath3 hillenbrand 2008 ) .",
    "we constructed a sample of 2,820 main - sequence field stars for which we have calculated age based on chromospheric activity . by using field stars , we created a sample with a smooth background age distribution .",
    "thus , any dependence of debris disk incidence on stellar age should stand out .    the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) offers a unique opportunity to discover new circumstellar disks .",
    "wise band 4 ( 22 @xmath0 m , hereafter w4 ) can trace infrared emission from the small ( micron - sized ) dust grains which dominate the emission from debris disks . not only is wise sensitive to 6 mjy ( 5@xmath4 ) at 22 @xmath0 m ( wright et al .",

    "these were mostly young ( @xmath61 gyr ) f and g type stars .",
    "thus , their detection rate will be higher than in an unbiased survey .",
    "they found 33 stars with evidence of ir excess ( a detection rate of 22 @xmath1 ) .",

    "in the present paper , we consider a sample of 2,820 stars with activity - determined ages which we examined with wise at 22 @xmath0 m , finding definite excesses around 98 stars ( detection rate of 3.5@xmath1 ) .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the process we used to determine whether or not an infrared excess was present . in section 3",

    ", we describe any potential issues and errors associated with our findings .",
    "since most debris disks can not be resolved , we depend on spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to identify ir excesses .",
    "seds were created with a fully automated fitting technique using theoretical models from hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to predict stellar photospheric fluxes .",
    "the seds were generated using available photometry from hipparcos ( perryman et al .",

    "these candidate excess sources were double - checked visually to make sure that the calculated excess was not due to a bad photospheric fit.@xmath9@xmath14 a blackbody was then fit to the apparent ir excess .",
    "when available , we used supplementary data from spitzer and herschel to better constrain the dust temperature and fractional ir luminosity .",
    "these data were downloaded from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive website ( irsa.ipac.caltech.edu ) .",
    "relevant data are found in table 3 .",
    "one sed representative of our sample is shown in figure 1 .",
    "zuckerman et al . (",
    "2011 ) found that hauschildt photopsheric models underpredicted the flux at 22 @xmath0 m by @xmath53@xmath1 .",
    "we used a subset of stars from jenkins et al .",
    "( 2011 ) - a sample of stars with known chromospheric activity - to test the hauschildt models . of the 868 stars in the jenkins sample",
    ", we used 230 stars which had snr between -1 and 1 , and which had w2 fluxes @xmath61 jy ( to avoid the saturation limit at 2 jy ) .",
    "we used this sample of 230 stars to compare two different photosphere models - one from hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the second a linear fit to w1 , w2 , and w3 . in the end , we chose to define snr using the  corrected \" photospheric value ( w4@xmath12 * 1.03 ) .",
    "finally , the data products from wise were individually inspected to make sure that there were no contaminating sources which could be mimicking an excess ( such as a binary companion or a background galaxy ) .",
    "the fwhm of the psfs for the different wise bands are : w1(3.4 @xmath0 m ) : 6.08@xmath15 ; w2(4.6",
    "@xmath0 m ) : 6.84@xmath15 ; w3(11 @xmath0 m ) : 7.36@xmath15 ; w4(22 @xmath0 m ) : 11.99@xmath15 .",
    "since we are considering excess in the w4 band , we use the fwhm of the psf in that band as the contamination radius ; if a point - like secondary source were found within 24@xmath15 ( 2@xmath16fwhm@xmath17 ) of the target , we considered that star to be  contaminated \" and it was no longer considered to be a candidate excess source .",
    "we allowed more room for extended nearby sources such as background galaxies . in the case of a nearby extended source , we define a contamination radius to be from the center of the contaminating galaxy to the center of the target in question , and set that radius at 1@xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , there were several cases in which an excess was seen at w4 in the sed , but no star is apparent in the wise data product .",
    "these stars were considered non - detections.@xmath19 if none of the aforementioned issues were encountered , the data product is considered to be  clean . \"    we also considered the possibility of an unseen background galaxy contaminating our w4 excess sources . given that the wise data products were checked for nearby sources , any remaining contaminating source would have to lie within the 6@xmath15 beam of the w4 band .",
    "kennedy & wyatt ( 2012 ) predict 0.06 spurious sources in their wise 468 targets ( a contamination rate of @xmath50.01@xmath1 ) . therefore , for our 2,820 targets",

    "stars with a deep convective zone ( cz ) experience differential rotation which heats the cz and ionizes the material in it .",
    "as this ionized material rotates , it enhances pre - existing weak magnetic fields .",
    "the strengthened magnetic field magnetizes material in the stellar wind as it leaves the system .",
    "this causes the outflowing material to rotate , resulting in a net loss of angular momentum . over time , the star will spin - down which , in turn , reduces its magnetic activity .",
    "thus as a star ages , it will spin down and its magnetic activity will weaken in a predictable way ( skumanich 1972 , barnes 2003 )    the magnetic activity can be measured by looking at the collisonally - dominated ca ii h@xmath3k absorption lines at @xmath53900 . in these lines ,",
    "the photosphere of the star is suppressed by absorption , and we can see the emission cores due to magnetic heating of the chromosphere .",
    "mamajek & hillenbrand ( 2008 ) - hereafter mh08 - provide us with a cluster - calibrated relationship between chromospheric activity and age :    @xmath20    where _ _",
    "r__@xmath21@xmath22 is a parameter measuring the strength of the ca ii h@xmath3k emission core and _ t _ is age in years .",
    "this relation is only valid ( calibrated ) if -5.1@xmath6log__r__@xmath21@xmath22@xmath6 - 4.0 . typical errors in age associated with this method are @xmath560@xmath1 ( mh08 ) .",
    "for some stars , there may be an additional uncertainty due to the long - period ( @xmath510 year ) magnetic variations due to the stellar cycle .",
    "this is discussed further in section 5.2 .",
    "in addition to an activity - age relation , mh08 suggests that an activity - rotation - age calculation can be used which , when used to calculate the ages of stars in binaries and open clusters , resulted in lower errors .",
    "also , the activity - rotation - age relation takes the mass of the star ( parameterized by the _ ( b - v ) _ color ) into account.this calculation requires that the chromospheric activity index is first used to calculate the rossby number ( noyes et al .",
    "1984 ) , which can then be used to calculate a rotation period .",
    "this period is then fed into a cluster - calibrated rotation - age (  gyrochronology \" ) relation :    @xmath23^{b}t^{n}\\ ] ]    where mh08 found that _ _",

    "these constants were determined by fitting the rotation - age equation to clusters with known ages ( up to the age of the hyades - 625 myr ) .",
    "it is valid for stars with 0.495@xmath6__(b - v)__@xmath2@xmath61.4 .",
    "the combined activity - rotation - age relation was calibrated to clusters up to 625 myr , field binaries up to @xmath510 gyr , and field stars up to @xmath515 gyr . by comparing the calculated ages of field binaries ,",

    "wright et al . (",
    "2004 ) constructed a sample of over 1,200 f , g , k , and m type stars with chromospheric activity measurements derived from 18,000 spectra from lick and keck observatories .",

    "three stars have evidence of an ir excess at w4 and clean data products . of those 3 stars ,",
    "all are presented here for the first time .",
    "the following discussion is taken largely from the annual review article by wyatt ( 2008 ) : the ir excess seen in debris disks differs significantly from that seen in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the most obvious difference is that protoplanetary disks consist largely of gas and sub - micron sized dust grains .",
    "these grains radiate very efficiently ( due to their high surface area - volume ratio ) .",
    "thus the fractional ir luminosities ( @xmath27 ) seen in protoplanetary disks are several orders of magnitude higher than those seen in debris disks and higher yet compared to the sun s kuiper belt ( kb)(@xmath27@xmath28@xmath510@xmath29 , @xmath27@xmath30@xmath510@xmath31 , @xmath27@xmath32@xmath510@xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition to their higher ir luminosities , protoplanetary disks also have shorter lifetimes than debris disks .",
    "most protoplanetary disks are completely dispersed @xmath510 myr after their formation due to mass loss and gas accretion onto the star ( wyatt 2008 ) .",
    "thus the circumstellar disks we see around @xmath1310 myr stars must be second generation ( zuckerman 2001 ) .      the dust observed in debris disks",
    "is thought to have formed from a collisional cascade in the planetary disk .",
    "the generally accepted model of dust formation is as follows : once the gas in the disk has been dispersed , rocky planetesimals can begin growing . at first , the disk experiences runaway growth as larger objects grow at faster rates due to gravitational focusing . once objects reach @xmath51000 km in size , they undergo oligarchic growth ( wyatt 2008 ) . in this phase , a few large planetesimals clean out the small ( @xmath6100 km ) bodies in their neighborhood , and grow slowly into protoplanet - sized objects . at this stage , the large objects in the forming planetary system can dynamically stir the leftover small objects .",
    "these small objects will eventually be given enough of a velocity kick for the resulting collisions between small bodies to be destructive .",
    "the cold dust that we see around stars with ages @xmath1310 myr is likely the result of these collisions .",
    "dust can be removed from the system in several ways .",
    "the most effective mechanism is due to radiative forces from the star .",
    "once collisions between intermediate ( @xmath6100 km ) sized bodies begins , a collisional cascade is triggered .",
    "two bodies collide to create a population of smaller bodies , which collide with each other to create even smaller bodies , and so on until the debris reaches the blow - out radius . at this point , the dust can be ejected from the system by radiative forces .",
    "dust can also be destroyed by spiraling toward the star as a result of poynting - robertson drag and ultimately being vaporized .",
    "small particles can also be carried out by a strong stellar wind . however , since the dust collision timescale for observed debris disks is much smaller than the timescale for poynting - robsertson drag , most dust loss is  collision dominated . \"",
    "( zuckerman 2001 ) .",
    "we examined the wise fluxes of 2,820 stars with chromospheric activity measurements .",
    "of those , 98 have excesses at 22 @xmath0 m ( 3.5@xmath1 ) .",
    "this detection rate agrees with the rate reported by trilling et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for 24@xmath0 m excesses around 184 fgk stars ( 3.8@xmath1)@xmath9@xmath34 .",
    "the ages of our debris disks range from 24 myr to 9.1 gyr , with an average of 2.7 gyr .",
    "the debris disk parameters are found in table 1 , and the associated wise data are found in table 2 . in figure 2 , we display the distribution of sample stars and debris disk stars as a function of chromospheric activity . we see the expected distribution of stars , with most of our sample being inactive ( log(__r__@xmath21@xmath22)@xmath6 - 4.8 ) and a hint of the vaughan - preston gap at intermediate activity levels ( vaughan & preston 1980 ) .",
    "it is clear that , relative to the background sample , debris disks are found preferentially around active stars .",
    "this is expected , since more active stars tend to also be younger .",
    "the distribution of the sample as a function of age is shown in figure 3 and indeed , we see that debris disks are found preferentially around younger stars . by fitting a logarithmic decline to our histogram of debris disk ages , we find that the number of debris disks declines as e@xmath35 where t@xmath2@xmath5175 myr ( figure 4 ) .",

    "we examined the evolution of the infrared luminosity fraction @xmath27 ( = l@xmath36/l@xmath37 ) with age , where @xmath27 is determined from the following formula :    @xmath38    where _ _ r__@xmath39 and _ _ t__@xmath39 are determined by the best - fit photospheric sed , _ _",

    "figures 6 , 7 , and 8 show a visualization of the dust radii compared with the solar system s kuiper and asteroid belts .",
    "the mass of the dust can be derived given certain assumptions about the observed dust :    @xmath43    where _ d _ is the distance from earth and @xmath44 is the dust opacity , and ( in the literature)is often assumed to be 1.7 cm@xmath8g@xmath46 at 800 @xmath0 m ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",

    "( 2007 ) provides a relation between the dust mass and the fractional ir luminosity @xmath27 ( = l@xmath36/l@xmath37 ) :    @xmath47    where _ a _ is the characteristic radius of the grains .",
    "this formula was confirmed empirically using stars with dust masses measured directly from the submillimeter flux , assuming that the dust is in an optically thin ring and that the radius and density of the grains do not change significantly from star to star ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "we similarly calculate dust masses for those stars in our sample with well defined values of @xmath27 ( those stars whose ir excess could be fit with a unique blackbody curve@xmath9@xmath48 ) .",
    "these masses are listed in table 3 .",
    "we expect the amount of dust ( parameterized by the fractional infrared luminosity ) to decline as a function of stellar age . over time , there should be more collisions between planetestimals , leading to more debris being ground down to the blow - out size and ejected from the system by radiative forces .",
    "this decline in @xmath27 with age has been seen in a stars and solar - type stars ( e.g. su et al . 2006 , bryden et al .",
    "2006 , rhee et al .",
    "we are able to reproduce this trend with our data ; the dustiest debris disks are found around young stars ( @xmath62 gyr ) .",
    "a summary of our findings broken down by spectral type can be found in table 4 .",
    "we find that debris disks were detected predominantly around k - type stars with @xmath52.5@xmath4 significance .",
    "this seems like a strange result .",
    "since a typical wise sensitivity limit is 6mjy , a detectable excess would have to be at least 6mjy above the photosphere . for stars at the same distance from earth",
    ", this excess would constitute a higher percentage of the photosphere ( a higher @xmath27 ) for a dim k star than for a bright f star .",
    "in other words , a higher @xmath27 would be required to constitute a significant excess around a dim k star , while a lower @xmath27 would be necessary to be detectable at that same level around an f - type star .",
    "thus we are sensitive to smaller @xmath27 in f stars than in k stars .",
    "since our sensitivity is set by the flux of the photosphere at 22 @xmath0 m ( for a given distance ) , we should be able to quantify our sensitivity bias .",
    "the flux of the photosphere is defined by :    @xmath49    where _ r _ is the radius of the star and _ d _ is the distance to earth .",
    "since our distance distribution shows no strong dependence on spectral type , we can assume that our f stars and k stars are essentially at the same distance .",
    "we also assume that all stars in table 1 have reached the rayleigh jeans tail by 22 @xmath0 m so that b@xmath50@xmath51 t . thus :    @xmath52    using average values for our f and k stars ( _ _ r__@xmath53=1.05r@xmath54 , _ _",

    "t__@xmath55=4100k ) , we find that _ _",
    "f__@xmath56/__f__@xmath57 = 2.5 .",
    "thus we are 2.5 times more sensitive to f stars than to k stars ; any discrepancy in the detection rate between f stars and k stars would only be magnified when this sensitivity is taken into account .",
    "trilling et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also found that k stars had a higher debris disk detection rate than g stars ( albeit with a smaller sample size ) .",
    "if young stars are preferentially found closer to earth , then we would be more sensitive to younger stars , and thus our sample would be biased .",
    "we examine this possibility in figure 9 . in figure 9",
    ", we can see that there is no obvious correlation between distance and age@xmath9@xmath58 .",
    "thus we do not believe that a parallax effect is biasing our data .",
    "since debris disks are found around the dustiest stars , it might be expected that they would also be preferentially found around stars with high metallicities .",
    "we gathered metallicity data for as many stars in our sample of 2,820 as possible ( @xmath52,000 stars ) from anderson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and examined the dependence of debris disk incidence on metallicity ; no correlation is apparent ( figure 10 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the findings of greaves et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who found no correlation between debris disk incidence and metallicity , even when there was a correlation between giant planet incidence and stellar metallicity .",
    "anderson et al . ( 2012 ) provide data on known planet hosts ; 136 of our 2,820 stars ( @xmath55@xmath1 ) are known hosts to one or more substellar objects .",
    "four stars out of 98 debris disks presented here ( @xmath54@xmath1 ) are planet hosts , and all have only one known giant planet .",
    "this is a surprising result , since we believe that debris disks are signposts of planet formation .",
    "the existence of planets , especially giant planets , helps to dynamically stir the population of small bodies to the velocity necessary for a collisional cascade .",
    "one therefore might expect to see a high percentage of planet hosts in our debris disk sample .",

    "hip 3391 also has a 22 @xmath0 m excess , but without additional data points we can only provide an upper limit on the temperature ( and a lower limit on the semi major axis of the dust ) . for a maximum dust temperature of 200 k ,",
    "the inner semi major axis of the dust is at 2.1 au .",
    "we can thus say that the dust is likely outside the orbit of the planet .",
    "we then refitted the dust blackbody , and found a minimum temperature of 45 k , corresponding to a maximum inner semi major axis of the dust of 42 au .",
    "hip 7978 is orbited by a 0.9m@xmath59 planet at 2.022 au ( butler et al .",
    ", 2011)and a 55 k belt of dust 30 au from the host star ( this work ) .",
    "additional data were taken from the irs , iras and mips catalogs and corroborate the ir excess seen by wise .",
    "thus we are confident about the quoted dust temperature and radius .",
    "hip 90593 hosts a 0.67m@xmath59 planet orbiting 2.24 au from its host star ( fischer et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it also has a single - channel excess indicating a debris disk with temperature 47 k@xmath6__t__@xmath6200 k , corresponding to a range of inner radius 2.62 au@xmath6__r__@xmath40@xmath647.4 au .",
    "the dust is likely located outside of the planet .",
    "hip 118319 is host to a 0.71m@xmath59 which orbits its host star at 0.233 au ( johnson et al .",
    "it also has a 137 k debris disk ( confirmed by a spitzer 70 @xmath0 m data point presented by bryden et al . 2009 ) at a minimum radius of 8.43 au , well outside the orbit of the planet .",
    "the results are consistent with a dust location analogous to the kuiper belt rather than the asteroid belt . thus our results seem consistent with the physical picture of a debris disk ( though we are working with small - number statistics and assuming that there are no undetected close - in planets ) .",
    "a visualization of the debris disks found around planet hosts with ill - determined dust locations can be seen in figure 11 .",
    "note that the dust radii in the top two panels of figure 11 represent the minimum radii of the dust orbits ( or the maximum temperature for the dust blackbody fits ) .",
    "the abundance of li absorption at 6707.8 @xmath60 has been cited as a possible tracer of stellar age ( e.g. zuckerman & song 2004 ) .",
    "twenty - eight stars in our debris disk sample have lithium abundances available in the literature . we were also able to measure lithium abundances for 8 stars in our debris disk sample using the hamilton echelle spectograph on the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "we reached typical sensitivities of 10 - 15 m@xmath60 .",
    "the relevant data are listed in table 5 .",
    "we compared the li abundance with the age determined from the activity - rotation - age relation of mh08 , and see that the li abundance decreases as a function of age ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "four of our stars which appear to be old according to their low levels of chromospheric activity also have no detectable lithium .",
    "this correlation supports our use of chromospheric activity as an age indicator .",
    "we know that our sun undergoes variations in magnetic activity over a @xmath5 11 year period",
    ". it is assumed ( and in some cases , observed ) that other solar - type stars experience similar short - term variations ( duncan et al .",
    "if snapshots of stellar activity are taken , there is no way to tell if the star is being observed during an active period , or a quiet period . only by taking long ( @xmath510 year ) baseline observations",
    "can we be certain that we are measuring the average magnetic activity of that star .",
    "few such surveys have been conducted ( e.g. wright et al .",
    "2004 ) , and future surveys will be limited by telescope availability ( a spectral resolution of at least 1 @xmath60 is needed to observe the ca ii h & k emission cores which indicate magnetic activity ) and the willingness of observers to spend decades on a single sample of stars .",
    "this systematic uncertainty introduces an extra source of error in the calculation of age from chromospheric activity . for the sun",
    ", this variation amounts to a 20@xmath1 uncertainty in age as calculated from the chromospheric activity during quiescence and during a period of high activity ( see vican 2012 for further discussion of this issue ) .      for single band excesses ,",
    "many different blackbodies could theoretically be fit to the same data point ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "the excess we see could be from warm dust emission , or the wein tail of a blackbody for cooler dust . in some cases",
    ", we were able to add data from previous studies ( spitzer , iras , etc . ) to constrain a blackbody fit to the dust .",
    "for those stars for which we found only one data point in excess ( i.e. w4 ) , we fit the maximum temperature blackbody , which corresponds to a lower limit to @xmath27 (= l@xmath36/l@xmath37 ) . for these stars , it is difficult to say how relevant our calculations for _ _ r__@xmath40 and _ _ m__@xmath40 may be , but we include these calculations in table 1 .",
    "follow - up observations with mid - ir instruments such as those on sofia might help resolve these discrepancies by providing a second data point with which one could constrain a blackbody dust fit .",
    "physical maps of the dust from alma would be the best way to determine the dust radius , since the blackbody radius often underestimates the true radius of the dust ( rodriguez & zuckerman 2012 ) .",
    "we examined 2,820 solar type ( f , g , and k type ) stars using wise to search for an infrared excess at 22 @xmath0 m .",
    "we found 98 stars with a clear wise excess at 22 @xmath0 m ( a detection rate of 3.5@xmath1 ) , 74 of which are presented here for the first time .",
    "an ir excess at 22 @xmath0 m is indicative of either hot dust or the wein tail of a cold dust component . for debris disks with only the 22 @xmath0",
    "m data point in excess , follow - up observations are necessary to constrain the properties of the dust .",
    "if the dust is truly hot ( @xmath5200 k ) , the drop - off in flux at long wavelengths will make detections with sub - mm instruments ( e.g. alma , scuba-2 ) unlikely ( although a non - detection could also help to constrain the dust temperature ; see bulger et al .",
    "mid - ir instruments such as forcast on sofia could be used to confirm the presence of cold dust .",
    "it is important to understand the temperature evolution of the dust , especially for those stars which seem to be old ( @xmath132 gyr ) .",
    "these old systems are either ( 1 ) the tail end of the steady - state evolution of solar type debris disks or ( 2 ) the result of cataclysmic collisions between two large rocky bodies ( e.g. bd + 20 307 , song et al . 2005 ) .",
    "observations in the mid - ir and sub - mm to determine the dust temperature will help distinguish between formation mechanisms .",
    "partial support for this work was supported by a nasa grant to ucla and by an nsf graduate research fellowship to laura vican .",
    "this project made use of the simbad and two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) databases and vizier search engine , operated by cds in france .",
    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer is a joint project between the university of california , los angeles , and the jet propulsion laboratory , funded by nasa .",
