    "the semi - conservative replication of dna requires a complete separation of the two strands , which occurs concomitantly with the production of new strands .",
    "even transcription needs a partial separation of the two strands of dna to read the genetic code of the base sequence @xcite .",
    "the traditional view of a temperature or ph induced melting is getting superseded by a more mechanical procedure of force or torque induced unzipping @xcite .",
    "this paradigm shift is because of the lack of extreme temperatures or the environment required in general for the melting ( the melting temperature is around 70 - 100c ) and the recent establishment of the unzipping as a genuine phase transition@xcite .",
    "a double - stranded ( ds ) dna remains in the bound doublet state below its melting temperature even when pulled by a force at one end until and unless the force exceeds a critical force @xmath0 , above which it opens into two single stranded ( ss ) dna .",
    "many aspects of this transition have been studied since then both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , mostly in equilibrium , though puzzles remain@xcite .    _ in vivo _ , a dna is opened by helicases , which are motors that move along the dna@xcite .",
    "both the motion and the opening processes require constant supply of energy . a few examples are dna - b , a ring like hexameric helicase that pushes through the dna like a wedge@xcite , pcra that goes through cycles of pulling the ds part of the dna and then moving on the ss part@xcite , viral rna helicase nph - ii that hops cyclically from the ds to the ss part of dna and back@xcite",
    ". such cycles of action and rest , with the periodic atp consumption , indicates an exertion of a periodic force on the dna .",
    "it suffices to describe the equilibrium unzipping transition by the two thermodynamic conjugate variables , force @xmath1 and separation @xmath2 of the pulled base pair ( fig.1 ) . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "a quasi - static change of the force from zero to a maximum @xmath3 and then back to zero , keeping other intensive quantities fixed , would result in retracing the thermodynamic path , ending at the initial state ; history plays no role because of ergodicity .",
    "in contrast , under a periodic force , the mismatch between the relaxation time and the external timescale for change of force would restrict the dna to explore a smaller region of the phase space , creating a difference in the response to an increasing or a decreasing force . near a phase transition , where the typical time scales of dynamics become large , the difference between the forward and the backward branches becomes prominent .",
    "this is hysteresis of dna unzipping@xcite .",
    "more recently kapri@xcite showed how the work theorem can be used _ via _ a multi - histogram method to extract the equilibrium isotherm from the hysteresis curves .",
    "the nature of hysteresis and its dependence on the applied field and frequency are well studied in the context of magnetic and structural systems@xcite , though it is the time - averaged loop that has received the attention . with the advent of single - molecule experiments on short dna chains ( oligomers )",
    ", it might be possible to probe the time - resolved loops , not just averages .",
    "motivated by the biological relevance and the experimental feasibility , we explore the behavior of dna under a periodic force , to be called a _ periodically driven dna_. our results show that without changing the physiological conditions ( _ e.g. _ the temperature or ph of the solvent ) , a dna chain may be brought from the unzipped state to the zipped state and _ vice versa _ by varying the frequency ( @xmath4 ) alone . by using a probabilistic description of the time variation of the dna response , we propose a force - frequency @xmath5-@xmath6 phase diagram for the driven dna .",
    "a similar dynamic symmetry breaking transition is known to occur in magnets where the nature of the hysteresis loop changes@xcite .",
    "because of the two stable phases , the unzipping transition has often been described by a two state landau type free energy functional @xcite . as a two phase system , we make use of the magnetic ising model to corroborate the behavior of dna , both undergoing a first order transition and showing hysteresis .",
    "we establish that the observed features and the phase diagram are robust and generic , and not tied to any particular dna model .",
    "it was recently shown that the dna hairpin ( fig .",
    "1 ) of 32 beads ( stem 10 base pairs and loop of 12 bases ) captures the essential properties of a long dna chain with implicit bubbles @xcite .",
    "the force - temperature diagram of the dna hairpin is found to be qualitatively similar to the dna unzipping experiment @xcite in the entire range of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , whereas the phase diagram for a dsdna of 16 base pairs differ significantly with the experiment . since , under the periodic force , the chain may unzip and rezip , the bubble dynamics and the wandering interface ( y - fork junction ) meeting transient bubbles ( extra source of entropy ) , would play important roles in hysteresis . needless to say that such bubbles are ubiquitous in a long chain .",
    "a dna hairpin is the simplest model , where the premade loop allows us to study the dynamics of such implicit bubbles .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dna - hairpin - under ] , we introduce the model used for the hairpin and the method of study .",

[ fig-1-sup ] ) .",
    "there have been efforts @xcite to understand transcription like processes by applying a constant force in the middle of a dna chain .",
    "a very rich phase diagram has been obtained though no such experiment has been reported so far to confirm the phase diagram .",
    "it appears that applying a force in the middle of the chain is experimentally difficult .",
    "moreover , the biological situation requires the force following a moving replication fork , which is also not amenable to single molecule force experiments . in view of these",
    ", we use a simpler geometry where the force is applied at one end of the hairpin keeping the other end fixed , which could be used in single molecule experiments",
    ". the typical time scale of fluctuations involved in unzipping varies from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and therefore we avoid the details of an all atom simulation by adopting a minimal off - lattice coarse grained model of a dna hairpin , where each bead represents nucleotide as a basic unit , which comprises a base , a sugar and a phosphate group .",

    "the parameter @xmath24 corresponds to the equilibrium distance in the harmonic potential , which is close to the equilibrium position of the average l - j potential .",
    "we obtained the dynamics of the system by using the following langevin equation @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of a bead which is set equal to one here , and the friction coefficient used in simulation is @xmath27 .",

    "the sequence of hysteresis loops ( fig.[fig-2 ] ( 11,21 & 31 ) ) is of a different nature .",
    "these clearly reflect that the dna starts from the z ( @xmath69 at the start of the cycle ) , goes to the u ( @xmath70 ) and then back to the z @xcite .",

    "the @xmath85-@xmath4 phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that of the dna hairpin , shown in fig [ fig : bound ] .",
    "this paper reports the possibility of a dynamical transition of a dna hairpin and a magnetic spin system both under a periodic drive .",
    "when a dna is subjected to a periodic force , or , a magnetic system is subjected to a periodic magnetic field , then the system driven away from equilibrium shows hysteresis .",
    "usually to get the hysteresis curve , one averages over many cycles of the field or force .",

    "this can be observed if one looks at the individual cycles . by quantifying the state of a cycle by @xmath73 , the average separation for dna or the average magnetization for the spins , we find that the distribution of @xmath73 is multi - peaked .",
    "whenever a distribution is multi - peaked , the average is not a good representation of the state .",
    "we identify the peaks of the distribution with the zipped ( z ) , unzipped ( u ) and the dynamical ( d ) state for the dna .",
    "there is a dynamical transition from one phase or state to another phase , and also there are coexistence of phases in some range of strength of drive and frequency .",
    "the phase diagrams constructed from the data for both the dna hairpin and the magnetic system are of similar nature .",
    "the role of hysteresis in biological processes remains an unexplored territory . on a more quantitative front ,",
