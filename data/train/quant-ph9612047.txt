    "soon after the discovery of fast quantum algorithms for factorization  @xcite , it was realized that the efficiency of quantum computers depends crucially on the control of errors during a computation .",
    "this is not surprising in itself , since classical computers also require an active monitoring of errors to operate properly .",
    "however , the dissipative techniques used in classical error correction destroy the superpositions necessary for quantum computation .",
    "this problem stimulated an important effort in the direction of quantum error correction .",
    "in the last year or so , after the initial discovery of quantum error correction codes by shor  @xcite and steane  @xcite , significant progress has been made in the development and understanding of these codes .",
    "much attention has been devoted to the construction of codes using a variety of different techniques to convert classical codes into quantum codes  @xcite and providing a mathematical description of large families of these codes  @xcite .",
    "minimal codes , that correct only one or a few errors , were also derived  @xcite .",
    "most of this work addresses the issue of how most efficiently to preserve a quantum state in a noisy environment _ given _ that encoding and decoding can be done in an error - free way .",
    "only a few recent papers have addressed the possibility of encoding and decoding in the presence of noise  @xcite ; these fault - tolerant schemes are relatively complicated and involve many more qubits than the earlier simple codes .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that we will see an experimental implementation of these more elaborate proposals in the near term . on the other hand ,",
    "the issue of errors arising during encoding and decoding has only been partially investigated in the simplest error correcting codes proposed so far  @xcite .",
    "these are the codes that could be implemented in a near - future quantum computer .",
    "the aim of this work is to bridge this gap , and provide numerical as well as algebraic evidence that for certain regimes of noise , error correction is worthwhile even when noise is present during the encoding and decoding steps , as will be the case in any real experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ noiseandec ] reviews the effect of unwanted environmental coupling on a quantum computer , its description in terms of master equations , and the fundamental operation of error correcting codes .",
    "section  [ analytic ] presents an analytical discussion of the effect of errors on an evolution consisting of encoding , free evolution of an encoded qubit , and decoding , with noise present at all stages .",
    "the concept of a quantum trajectory is described in section  [ sec4 ] , where numerical simulation algorithms are presented using two unravelings of the master equation ( quantum jumps and quantum state diffusion ) as well as direct numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "the numerical methods are found to be in reasonable agreement with the analytical model .",
    "a quantum system in complete isolation evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the state of the system ( in this case a quantum computer ) and @xmath3 is the hamiltonian ( in this case representing the action of the quantum `` gates ; '' in general , @xmath3 will be time - dependent ) .",
    "this evolution is unitary .",
    "unfortunately , the approximation of a system being isolated is only good for microscopic noninteracting systems .",
    "as a system becomes larger and more complicated , the effects of the environment become more important .",
    "consider the example of a single qubit interacting with an external environment .",
    "the state of the qubit is described by a vector in a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a convenient basis is the canonical basis @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that the qubit is initially in a superposition state @xmath5 and the environment in some unknown state @xmath6 .",
    "as the system and environment interact , the initial product state @xmath7 can evolve into an entangled state @xmath8 , where the environment has become correlated with the state of the system ( more realistic models of coupling with the environment can be found in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the system can no longer be described by a state on its own .",
    "normally , an environment is very complicated , containing many degrees of freedom , so it is likely that @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be orthogonal ( or very nearly so ) .",
    "thus , if we trace out the environment degrees of freedom , an ensemble of our systems of interest is left in a _ mixture _ , described by a reduced density matrix @xmath11 in effect , the environment has measured the value of the qubit , and the superposition has been destroyed . in this case , the evolution of the reduced system is no longer unitary ; and algorithms which depend on the unitarity of the evolution , such as the shor algorithm , will no longer function .",
    "the general effects of the environment on a quantum system can be very complicated and difficult to describe .",
    "however , a useful approximation is to assume that the effects of the environment are markovian , or local in time . in this case",
    ", it is possible to describe the evolution of the reduced density matrix by a _ master equation _ of lindblad form @xcite @xmath12 +   \\sum_j\\left(\\hat l_j\\hat\\rho \\hat l_j^\\dagger   - { 1\\over2 } \\hat l_j^\\dagger\\hat l_j\\hat\\rho    - { 1\\over2}\\hat\\rho   \\hat l_j^\\dagger\\hat l_j\\right ) \\ ; , \\label{eqmaster}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the system hamiltonian and the @xmath14 are the lindblad operators representing the interaction with the environment .",
    "this markovian approximation is generally very good when the environment is large compared with the system and the interaction between them is fairly weak .",
    "it might fail , however , for some realizations of quantum computers .",
    "what kinds of lindblad operators typically occur in ( [ eqmaster ] ) ?",
    "this depends on the physics of the system , but certain operators are common in quantum optical and atomic physics models .",
    "one normal effect of environmental interaction is _ dissipation _ , as in _",
    "spontaneous emission_. if the qubit state @xmath15 represents an excited state , there will be a lindblad operator proportional to the lowering operator , of the form @xmath16 , ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the qubit will tend to the ground state in the long term , regardless of its initial state .",
    "if the environment has a non - zero temperature , there is the possibility of thermal excitations as well , represented by another lindblad operator proportional to the raising operator @xmath19 .",
    "even if the rate of dissipation is small enough to be negligible , the environment can still act to destroy superpositions . as we saw in ( [ dephase ] ) , correlations which develop with the environment can randomly _ dephase _ the basis states @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "this process is represented by a lindblad operator proportional to the @xmath21 pauli matrix , @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the most general interaction will reduce the qubit ensemble density operator to the one at the center of the bloch sphere .",
    "the individual ( pure ) states of the members of the ensemble can be viewed as moving randomly on the surface of the sphere .",
    "this effect is represented by _ isotropic noise _",
    ", with three lindblad operators proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , used in studying the depolarizing channel @xcite .",
    "the exact choice of model is determined by the physics of the quantum computer and its environmental interactions .      for a qubit @xmath27 ,",
    "the most general form of single - qubit error induced by the environment can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary operator which can be decomposed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the identity and the @xmath32 are the pauli matrices . in the simplest case ( when one wants to protect a single qubit ) , error correcting codes consist in encoding the basis states @xmath33 and @xmath34 of a qubit in well chosen states of several qubits : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 belong to the extended hilbert space of several qubits .",
    "numerous techniques for constructing these codes have appeared in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "these error correcting techniques commonly assume that the encoding step ( i.e. the operation by which a single qubit in state @xmath38 is entangled with additional qubits to form the state @xmath39 ) as well as the decoding and correcting steps are done in a noiseless environment .",
    "the issue of noisy encoding and decoding has been addressed little outside the context of fault - tolerant techniques , which require many more qubits @xcite . in this work , we will focus on earlier and more compact codes , and analyze the issue of noisy encoding and decoding . in the next two sections we review the two codes that we have analyzed .      if one seeks to protect a qubit against a dephasing noise ( in eq .",
    "[ generror ] this is equivalent to setting @xmath40 ) , it can be shown that the smallest possible code requires three qubits to encode the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the initial qubit .",
    "this carefully chosen superposition was first proposed by shor  @xcite .",
    "we use here an equivalent version found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath41 ( normalization factors have been omitted ) .",
    "we use the networks for encoding and for decoding / correcting shown in fig .",
    "[ 3bitfig ] .",
    "initially , the first qubit is in the state @xmath5 .",
    "this is the state we wish to protect .",
    "the second and third qubits are in the state @xmath33 .",
    "the result of the encoding network is the three - qubit state @xmath39 .    in these figures",
    "we choose the various quantum gates in such way that they can be described by simple hamiltonians .",
    "the gates @xmath42 correspond to the unitary operation @xmath43 effected by the hamiltonian @xmath44 acting for one unit of time .",
    "similarly the gate @xmath45 corresponds to the unitary operation @xmath46 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath47 acting for one unit of time .",
    "please note that these matrices are represented in the basis @xmath48 , as is the convention in the quantum computation literature .",
    "unfortunately , this is precisely the opposite of the usual convention for the pauli matrices . for this paper",
    "we have retained the quantum computation basis , as we do not present the pauli matrices explicitly , but this notational conflict should be resolved .",
    "the two - bit gates of the network correspond to controlled phase shifts .",
    "these are represented in the canonical basis @xmath49 by the unitary operator @xmath50 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 designate the two qubits on which the gate acts and @xmath54 is the projector on state @xmath34 . in this case",
    "a state @xmath55 picks up a phase @xmath56 iff both qubits are in state @xmath34 .",
    "variants on this gate can be obtained by replacing either or both of the projection operators with @xmath57 in the definition of the hamiltonian .",

    "we have been explicitly assuming that the influence of the environment produces errors of type ( [ error_form ] ) .",

    "however , it should be noted that this continuous evolution is not necessarily the _ desired _ evolution ; the non - hermitian component may produce unwanted effects , depending on the lindblad operators .",
    "if we choose dephasing noise , so that @xmath162 , then the effective hamiltonian is @xmath163 , resulting merely in a renormalization of the state ; in the case of spontaneous emission , however , we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 , which changes the relative weight of the @xmath20 and @xmath15 states .    this sort of _ continuous _ error does not fit the error correction paradigm , and therefore can not be completely corrected .",
    "however , all is not lost : if @xmath166 is very small , then it is possible to expand @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a function of the commutator of @xmath3 and @xmath169 , and to first order in @xmath166 the error correcting algorithm will still work .",
    "similarly , we see that the second and higher terms in ( [ rho_expansion ] ) correspond to more than one `` error '' occurring during the time @xmath69 ; hence , error correction techniques for single errors will be ineffective for these terms . but",

    "assume further that between the encoding and decoding stages , the hamiltonian @xmath181 for the three qubits ( interaction picture ) .",

    "such errors can not necessarily be corrected , and represent a loss additional to that from the higher order terms in the expansion .",
    "the first two terms represent the possibilities of no errors or a single correctable error occurring .",
    "the longer the time @xmath69 between error correcting steps , the larger the higher - order terms , while the shorter the time @xmath69 , the higher the proportion @xmath183 spent encoding and decoding . hence , there should be an optimal time @xmath184 between error corrections as a function of @xmath130 and @xmath124 , which minimizes the total error rate , consistent with the result of ( [ topt ] ) . for dephasing or isotropic noise , ( [ topt ] )",

    "can be overcome by unraveling the density operator evolution into _ quantum trajectories _",
    "since quantum trajectories represent the system as a state vector rather than a density operator , they often have a numerical advantage over solving the master equation directly , even though one has to average over many quantum trajectories to recover the solution of the master equation .",
    "a single quantum trajectory can also give an excellent , albeit qualitative , picture of a single experimental run .",
    "we see from section [ secerrorqj ] that we can justify the use of the stochastic error models in sections 2 and 3 , in spite of the continuous , deterministic character of the master equation itself .",

    "we have applied both jump and qsd equations to the problems considered in this paper .",
    "it turns out that to obtain good statistics , a significantly smaller number of trajectories need be summed when the qsd equation was used .",
    "we thus limit further discussion to the qsd equation , a nonlinear stochastic differential equation for a normalized state vector @xmath198 : @xmath202 the first sum in this equation represents the deterministic drift of the state vector due to the environment , and the second sum the random fluctuations .",
