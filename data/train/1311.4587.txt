    "( [ eq : ssleptons ] ) .",

    "such degeneracy is not necessarily expected in generic susy models such as the pmssm unless there is a protective symmetry : for instance , @xmath1 or @xmath2 gut symmetry provides the required degeneracy provided additional contributions ( such as running gauge contributions ) are not very large .",
    "our results seem to hint at the existence of an additional organizing principle if a decoupling solution ( with sfermions heavier than @xmath0  tev ) to the susy flavor , cp , gravitino and proton - decay problems is invoked along with electroweak naturalness .",
    "this could well be a grand unification symmetry , in accord with recent calculations of flavor changing contributions to @xmath108 where @xmath2 mass relations also contribute to suppress flavor violation@xcite .",
