    "the equilibrium dynamics of a dense polymer system , i.e. , a melt , a solution of high concentration , or a free chain moving through a gel , is an important topic of polymer physics .",
    "it has been investigated for many years , but still is not fully understood .",
    "the problem is quite complex , even if we concentrate on the motion of a single chain .",
    "clearly , its motion is strongly hindered by the surrounding chains , which the chain considered can not cross .",
    "this has led to the idea @xcite that the motion of the chain is confined to a tube roughly defined by its instantaneous configuration .",
    "thus the tube is assumed to have a random walk configuration which changes only by the motion of the chain ends .",
    "the ends can retract into the tube which thus is effectively shortened , and they can creep out of the original tube , thus creating a new tube segment in some random direction .",
    "the interior parts of the tube are assumed to be fixed in space until they are reached by the diffusive motion of the chain ends .",
    "this concept of a tube is one basic ingredient of the ` reptation ' @xcite scenario , which certainly is valid provided the obstacles confining the chain motion form a rigid , time independent network . in a realistic system",
    "the surrounding chains are mobile , which sheds some doubt on the postulated existence of a well defined tube . indeed",
    ", there exist other approaches @xcite , more in line with standard many body theory , which are not based on the tube concept .",
    "most work on the reptation model concentrates on asymptotic results expected to hold for long chains in special time regions ( see sect .",
    "ii.a ) . in comparison to experiments or simulations",
    ", these results often fail on the quantitative level @xcite , and partly other theories seem to be more satisfactory @xcite .",
    "thus some work @xcite has been invested to incorporate additional physical effects like relaxation of the surrounding or specific interaction effects into asymptotic reptation theory .",
    "however , the evaluation of the pure reptation model outside asymptotic limits has found only little attention . in recent work @xcite , we presented such a calculation for the motion of individual segments of the chain .",
    "we found that asymptotic results , which for the quantities considered take the form of specific power laws , apply only to surprisingly long chains .",
    "large time intervals are covered by crossover regions .",
    "our crossover functions compare very well to simulations @xcite of the pure reptation model , i.e. , to the motion of a flexible chain through a fixed regular lattice of impenetrable obstacles .",
    "furthermore , also results of simulations of melts look quite similar to our analytical results for short chains .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the tube diameter , i.e. , the average distance among effective obstacles extracted from the simulations , is fairly large . since in the pure reptation model ,",
    "the tube width is of the order of the effective segment size of the reptating chain , this implies that to map melt dynamics on the reptation model , we have to consider a coarse grained chain of effective segment number @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the chain length ( polymerization index ) of the physical macromolecule , whereas the ` entanglement length ' @xmath9 is the length of a subchain which shows a coil radius of the order of the obstacle spacing . in recent simulations @xcite of melts ,",
    "a value @xmath10 was reached , far below the value @xmath11 needed according to our theory to clearly identify asymptotic power laws .",
    "other recent simulations @xcite reach a value @xmath12 , but for this chain length they cover only times short compared to the characteristic time scales of the reptation model .",
    "still , the onset of a first power law regime is seen , again consistent with our theory .",
    "thus , concerning the motion of individual chain segments within a melt , there at present seems to be no need to invoke other mechanisms than pure reptation .",
    "the motion of specific segments is easily accessible only to computer experiments .",
    "physical experiments often measure dynamic scattering functions .",
    "asymptotic results of the reptation model for the coherent scattering function have been worked out previously @xcite , but our analysis of segment motion suggests that an evaluation of the scattering function outside asymptotic limits is needed .",
    "this is the topic of the present work .",
    "we use the same analytical reptation model as in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "we also measured the coherent structure function in monte carlo simulations , again using the same implementation of the model as previously @xcite .",
    "this allows for a comparison among theory and data , where all parameters are fixed by our previous work .",
    "some results of the simulations will be presented here , but a detailed comparison of our simulation results to the present and previous theories will be presented in a separate , less technical paper @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the basic features of the reptation model and recall previous results for the coherent structure function . in sect .",
    "iii , we introduce our analytical model and outline the structure of our approach . in sect .",
    "iv , we consider those contributions to the coherent structure function in which the initial tube is not yet completely destroyed by the stochastic motion .",
    "a rigorous analysis is possible as long as end effects can be neglected .",
    "these end effects , known as ` tube renewal ' and ` tube length fluctuations ' , can be treated only in some approximation .",
    "we here generalize an approach which in our previous work gave good results for the segment motion . in sect .",
    "v , we compare our rigorous results for the motion within the initial tube to those of the model of a ` rouse chain in a coiled tube ' @xcite .",
    "pronounced differences are found and their origin is clarified . in sect .",
    "vi , we derive an integral equation which takes complete tube destruction into account . for long chains and times large",
    "compared to the internal relaxation time of the chain , we recover the results of the ` primitive chain ' model @xcite , as shown in sect .",
    "typical numerical results of our theory are discussed in sect .",
    "it is found that tube length fluctuations , which have been neglected in previous calculations of the coherent scattering function , in fact determine the scattering up to times larger than the rouse time . in sect .",
    "viii , we also present some results of our simulations , which compare favorably with our theory .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "ix contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the full evaluation of the reptation model leads to quite involved expressions , and some part of the analysis is summarized in appendices .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the reptation model assumes the existence of a tube defined by the instantaneous configuration of the chain together with the surrounding obstacles .",
    "the chain can not leave the tube sideways since it would have to fold into a double - stranded conformation which costs too much entropy .",
    "those parts of the chain , which lie stretched in the tube , essentially can not move . in the interior of the tube only little wiggles of ` spared length ' are mobile , as illustrated in fig .  1 for the special case of a lattice model .",
    "these wiggles carry out brownian motion along the chain .",
    "if a wiggle reaches a chain end , it may decay and prolong the tube by its spared length .",
    "chain ends also may produce new wiggles which then diffuse into the interior of the tube .",
    "this shortens the tube by the spared length of the newly created wiggle . in the long run",
    ", this random motion of the chain ends leads to a complete destruction of the initial tube .",
    "this very simple dynamical model involves several time scales .",
    "it needs a microscopic time @xmath13 until the segment motion feels the existence of the constraints .",
    "@xmath13 generally is identified with the rouse time of a chain of length equal to the entanglement length @xmath9 : @xmath14 @xmath13 is relevant for the short - time dynamics of melts , where the tube diameter typically is found to be quite large @xcite : @xmath15 . for reptation , @xmath13 defines the elementary time step , since this theory does not deal with the unconstrained motion on scale of the tube diameter .",
    "a second scale @xmath16 is the time a wiggle needs to diffuse over the whole chain . since in the coarse grained description ,",
    "the wiggle has to diffuse a distance of @xmath8 steps , one finds @xmath17 @xmath16 thus is of the order of the rouse time of the whole chain .",
    "finally , the reptation time @xmath18 is needed to destruct the initial tube completely .",
    "reptation theory @xcite predicts @xmath19 as limiting result for long chains .",
    "asymptotically power laws as function of @xmath20 and @xmath1 are predicted to hold for the segment motion or the motion of the center of mass in the time windows @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . as a typical result we quote the mean squared spatial displacement of some bead of the chain : @xmath24 here @xmath25 gives the spatial position of bead @xmath26 at time @xmath20 .",
    "the bar indicates the ( dynamic ) average over the stochastic motion and the pointed brackets denote the ( static ) average over all tube configurations .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath27 beads ( @xmath1 segments ) , labelled by @xmath28 .",
    "the coherent structure function is defined as @xmath29 by definition @xmath30 refers to a single chain .",
    "it can be measured by appropriately labelling a few chains in the system .",
    "reptation results for @xmath30 previously have been derived by doi and edwards @xcite and by de gennes @xcite .",
    "doi and edwards have evaluated a simplified version of the reptation model , where the internal motion of the chain is neglected .",
    "the physical chain is replaced by a ` primitive chain ' , which only can slide along the tube so that all segments experience the same curvilinear displacement @xmath31 .",
    "this model therefore reduces the dynamics to diffusive motion of the single stochastic variable @xmath32 . for the coherent structure function , it yields the result ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 6.3.4 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of gyration and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the debye function : @xmath37 the @xmath38 are the positive solutions of @xmath39 neglecting all internal motions , the result can be applied only for @xmath40 , i.e. , in a time regime where the internal degrees of freedom are equilibrated . in the limit of large wave numbers @xmath41 ,",
    "the result reduces to @xmath42~.\\ ] ] this is the scattering from that part of the primitive chain which at time @xmath20 still resides in the initial tube @xcite .    the limit @xmath43 has also been considered by de gennes . taking the internal relaxation of the chain into account ,",
    "his result @xcite for the normalized coherent scattering function is a sum of two terms : @xmath44 the ` creep term ' @xmath45 is given by eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) and thus describes the large time behavior @xmath40 .",
    "it tends to @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the ` local term ' @xmath48 is taken from an approximate evaluation of the internal relaxation of an infinitely long one - dimensional rouse chain , folded into the three - dimensional random walk configuration of a tube of @xmath8 segments .",
    "the result reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 this introduces an additional @xmath51-dependent time scale @xmath52 which in view of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath55 governs the relaxation of segment density fluctuations on scale @xmath56 . in view of @xmath43",
    ", @xmath55 is much smaller than @xmath57 , and for times @xmath58 , the creep term is constant , @xmath59 . on top of this plateau , @xmath48 yields a peak rapidly decreasing in time .",
    "note that @xmath48 for @xmath60 behaves as @xmath61 .",
    "the amplitude of the peak is determined by @xmath62 , which only depends on @xmath63 and @xmath9 .",
    "both these approaches neglect end effects like tube length fluctuations , which are governed by the time scale @xmath16 .",
    "the approximations involved greatly simplify the analysis but are no essential part of the reptation model . in the sequel",
    ", we present an analysis of the full model , accounting for the internal degrees of freedom and the finite chain length .",
    "since all the dynamics is driven by the diffusion of the spared length as the only stochastic process , this yields a unified description of local relaxation , global creep and tube length fluctuations .",
    "we will find that tube length fluctuations , in particular , have an important influence for intermediate times and chain lengths .",
    "internal relaxation , however , is of much less influence than the results referred to above suggest .",
    "we here recall the essential features of our model . a more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "the chain is modeled as a random walk of @xmath1 steps of fixed length @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the motion is due to the diffusion of wiggles of spared length @xmath66 .",
    "these are represented by particles hopping along the chain from bead to bead , with hopping probability @xmath67 per time step .",
    "the particles do not interact , and a given particle sees the others just as a part of the chain .",
    "if a particle passes a bead @xmath26 , it tracks it along by a distance of the spared length @xmath66 , which is taken to be the same for all particles .",
    "the end beads @xmath68 of the chain are coupled to large reservoirs , which absorb and emit particles at such a rate that the equilibrium density @xmath69 of particles on the chain is maintained on average . keeping track of the change of the particle number in these reservoirs",
    ", we control the motion of the chain ends : creation or decay of a wiggle at a chain end implies emission or absorption of the corresponding particle by the reservoir .    for the motion of beads in the interior of the tube , the essential stochastic variable of the model is the number @xmath70 of particles which passed over bead @xmath26 within time interval",
    "@xmath71 $ ] .",
    "@xmath72 here @xmath73 is the number of particles that came from the ` left ' @xmath74 or from the ` right ' @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "consider , for instance , the motion of segment @xmath26 for a time interval in which it stays in the original tube .",
    "its displacement in the tube is given by @xmath76 , and since the tube has a random walk configuration , its spatial displacement is given by @xmath77 since the underlying stochastic process is single particle hopping , the distribution function of @xmath70 is easily calculated , with the result ( ref .",

    "similarly , from the other end tube destruction within time @xmath20 proceeds to bead @xmath109 with @xmath110 being the maximal negative fluctuation of the occupation number @xmath111 of the reservoir at chain end @xmath1 . the stochastic processes @xmath103 or @xmath111 are not markovian , since a particle emitted by a reservoir can be reabsorbed by the same reservoir later .",
    "this induces a correlation which dies out only if the particle has time to reach the other reservoir , i.e. , on time scale @xmath16 .",
    "for such a correlated process , the distribution and the moments of @xmath112 can not be calculated rigorously , even though arbitrary moments of @xmath113 , involving any number of time variables @xmath104 , can be evaluated ( see @xcite , sect .",
    "as soon as tube renewal comes into play , we therefore have to resort to some approximation .",
    "some important quantity entering our theory is the average @xmath114 .",
    "it , for instance , yields the motion of the end - segment via the relation [ ref .",

    "this ` mean hopping rate ' approximation , which was discussed in more detail in @xcite , gives good results for larger times .",
    "for microscopic times , it underestimates @xmath114 by about a factor of 2 , but with increasing time it approaches the full result for @xmath118 as found in simulations . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the deviation for the motion of the end segment , which is most sensitive to our approximation , is of the order of 10 % only ( see fig .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the basic quantity to be considered , is the scattering from a pair of beads @xmath120 which must be summed over the beads to find the coherent structure function @xmath0 .",
    "to get some information on the contribution of the different parts of the chain , we consider a slight generalization in which we sum only over the @xmath121 central beads @xmath122 clearly , the coherent structure function of the full chain is @xmath123    to calculate @xmath124 , we first consider the contribution @xmath125 which results from those stochastic motions for which a part of the initial tube still exists at time @xmath20 .",
    "( the upper index @xmath126 stands for ` tube ' . )",
    "we then can set up an integral equation for @xmath124 , in which @xmath125 shows up as inhomogeneity ( see sect .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath127 , contributions where the tube is destroyed completely , are negligible , and @xmath128 coincides with @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath125 incorporates the effects of internal relaxation and tube length fluctuations , and its calculation is the most tedious part of our analysis .",
    "we here need to simultaneously control the motion of segment @xmath26 and of the chain ends .",
    "more specifically , we will need the distribution function @xmath130 i.e. , the simultaneous distribution of @xmath70 and @xmath106 under the constraint that a part of the initial tube still exists . again",
    "the correlated nature of the stochastic motion of the chain ends prevents a rigorous evaluation of @xmath131 , and we use random walk theory to construct an approximate functional form .",
    "the result depends on @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath20 only through the rescaled variables @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , and in the spirit of our mean hopping rate approximation , we in these variables replace the normalizing factors @xmath136 and @xmath137 of the random walk by their counterparts for the proper correlated process .",
    "in essence , this again amounts to replacing the correlated stochastic motion of the chain ends by a whole sequence of uncorrelated random walks , parametrized by an effective hopping rate @xmath138 .",
    "this hopping rate is adjusted such that the random walk which replaces the correlated process for final time @xmath20 , at _ that time _ yields the correct moments @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "( it in fact yields the correct gaussian distribution of the single variable @xmath70 . )   as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , sect .",
    "v.b , @xmath138 changes from a value @xmath141 at microscopic times to @xmath142 for @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath141 governs the short time motion of a segment whereas @xmath142 is the mobility of the primitive chain , the mean hopping rate approximation smoothly interpolates between these more rigorously accessible limits .",
    "this will be discussed again in sect .",
    "iv.c , after we presented the details of our approach .",
    "our theory involves three important time ( and segment index ) dependent parameter - functions : @xmath143 measures the extent of tube destruction and thus accounts for tube length fluctuations . for @xmath114",
    ", we use the approximation ( 3.16 ) .",
    "it turns out that the time dependence of @xmath144 which very slowly tends to its asymptotic limit @xmath145 ( cf .",
    "( 7.2 ) ) , is responsible for the well known crossover behavior of the reptation time : @xmath146 , where @xmath147 slowly approaches its asymptotic value @xmath148 from above .",
    "( a detailed discussion of the reptation time will be given in a separate paper . )    a second function , @xmath149 , measures the coupling of the motion of an interior segment @xmath26 to the motion of a chain end .",
    "initially , this coupling vanishes , but it increases with time due to particles created at a chain end and traveling over segment @xmath26 . if this coupling is fully developed , all segments approximately have moved the same distance in the tube and the primitive chain model results .",
    "the precise definition of @xmath150 is given in eq .",
    "( 4.17 ) .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the effective mobility of a segment for @xmath151 depends on its position in the chain , an effect already present for free rouse type motion .",
    "this is taken into account by the function @xmath152 , which is defined in eq .",
    "( 4.36 ) .",
    "having described the main ideas of our approach , we now turn to the details .",
    "we first construct and analyze the tube conserving contribution @xmath153 to the structure function .",
    "in this and the next section , we consider the contribution of those stochastic processes , which do not destroy the initial tube completely , i.e. , we insist on the inequality @xmath154 since due to the definitions ( 3.12 ) , ( 3.15 ) , the tube has been destroyed up to segment @xmath98 from chain end @xmath105 or @xmath155 from chain end @xmath1 , respectively .",

    ", we have to distinguish several cases .",
    "we use the notation @xmath157 and we illustrate the analysis with two typical cases shown in fig .  2 .",

    "a gives a schematic sketch of a situation , in which the inequalities @xmath158 hold .",
    "that means that tube renewal from chain end @xmath105 has not passed over the original position of segment @xmath156 , and segment @xmath26 at time @xmath20 is not found in the part of the new tube created from chain end @xmath1 .",

    "this is not due to our approximations which essentially only concern the treatment of tube length fluctuations .",
    "considering for instance the data for @xmath592 , we note that the deviations from the theory are strongest for @xmath602 , where tube destruction and tube length fluctuations are irrelevant and our theory for the internal part @xmath603 is an exact evaluation of the reptation model .",
    "furthermore , the deviations are fairly independent of the lengths of the end pieces @xmath604 .",
    "this suggests that we see some ( non - universal ) relaxation of the micro - structure .",

    "the wave - vector @xmath605 is large enough to resolve such details .",
    "since the dynamic effects of micro - structure should saturate at larger times , this suggests that we should scale down the theoretical curves by some factor @xmath606 .",

    "for @xmath608 , theory and data agree excellently .",
    "the same level of agreement can be reached for the data of fig .",
    "we therefore believe that our theory adequately describes the universal part of the coherent scattering function , including tube length fluctuations and ( universal ) internal relaxation .",
    "a more extensive presentation of simulation results , comparing with the present and previous theories , will be published elsewhere .",
    "here we only note that we have taken data for values of @xmath609 ranging from 1.0 to 0.1 , and the @xmath51-dependence found for the initial deviation among theory and simulations strongly supports the interpretation as micro - structure effects .",
    "in this work , we have exploited the pure reptation model to calculate the coherent structure function @xmath2 of a flexible chain moving through an array of impenetrable topological obstacles .",
    "our analysis is rigorous for a subchain ( length @xmath5 ) in the interior of an infinitely long chain @xmath610 .",
    "this allows for a detailed comparison with an approach where the interior motion of the chain is modeled as one dimensional rouse motion along a coiled tube .",
    "we found that the latter model starts from unphysical non - equilibrium initial conditions , which relax only on the scale of the rouse time @xmath611 of the subchain .",
    "this relaxation completely distorts the time dependence of @xmath612 for times @xmath613 . only for times",
    "@xmath614 , this model is equivalent to the reptation model . if applied to the total chain , local relaxation calculated as rouse motion in a tube therefore is unphysical .",
    "a realistic system may show some relaxation which is specific to the microscopic dynamics , and which is not contained in the pure reptation model .",
    "however , our analysis sheds strong doubts on an interpretation of such non - universal effects within the framework of the model of a rouse chain in a tube .    to evaluate the total structure function for all times , we have derived integral equations which split @xmath381 into a contribution @xmath475 of configurations where some part of the initial tube still exists , and the remainder .",
    "the kernel and in particular the inhomogeneities ( like @xmath475 ) of these equations can not be calculated rigorously .",
    "they involve distribution functions coupling the motion of a given segment to tube renewal , which is a non - markovian process with memory time of the order of the rouse time @xmath615 . to calculate the functional form of these distributions , we used a random walk approximation .",
    "we thus at each instant of time replaced the correlated process by an uncorrelated process which as closely as possible reproduces the instantaneous distributions of the correlated process .",
    "this ` mean hopping rate ' approximation introduces functions @xmath616 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 which appear as parameters in the distribution functions and can be calculated from the microscopic hopping process of spared length in the reptation model .",
    "they also have a simple physical meaning : @xmath144 measures the average extent of tube destruction , @xmath150 describes the coupling of motion of segment @xmath26 to tube destruction , and @xmath617 takes care of the inhomogeneity of the effective segment mobility along the chain which arises from the fact that the mobile units , i.e. , the wiggles of spared length , can be created and destroyed only at the chain ends .    in the limit of long chains and time @xmath40",
    ", the parameters @xmath221 and @xmath294 tend to 1 irrespective of @xmath26 , and @xmath618 .",
    "our theory then reproduces the results of the ` primitive chain ' model .",
    "our proof of this asymptotic result amounts to a derivation of the primitive chain model from microscopic reptation dynamics .",
    "combined with the analysis of the internal motion for @xmath259 , this result allows for a mapping of the microscopic parameters of our reptation model to the more commonly used rouse - type parameters .",
    "the parameter functions @xmath149 , @xmath617 , and @xmath144 approach their asymptotic behavior only slowly , and it needs chain lengths of order @xmath619 to find a time region where the primitive chain model is valid .",
    "in particular , for shorter chains the reptation time , if extracted by fitting the doi - edwards result for the primitive chain model to the large time behavior of @xmath30 in the reptation model , does not obey the asymptotic power law @xmath620 . as will be shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it rather exhibits the well known behavior @xmath146 , with an effective exponent @xmath621 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath149 , @xmath617 , and @xmath144 from their asymptotic primitive chain behavior incorporates the effect of internal relaxation and tube length fluctuations .",
    "our numerical evaluation of the full theory illustrates that these effects in general are quite important .",
    "in particular , we find a clear difference among the time variation of scattering from the total chain compared to scattering from internal pieces .",
    "the latter are less influenced by tube length fluctuations but are more strongly affected by internal relaxation .",

    "<S> our theory concentrates on the universal aspects of reptational motion , and our results in all details show excellent agreement with our simulations of the evans - edwards model , provided we allow for a phenomenological prefactor which accounts for non - universal effects of the micro - structure of the monte carlo chain , present for short times . </S>",
    "<S> previous approaches to the coherent structure function can be analyzed as special limits of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> first , the effects of internal relaxation can be isolated by studying the limit @xmath4 , @xmath5 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the results do not support the model of a ` rouse chain in a tube ' . </S>",
    "<S> we trace this back to the non - equilibrium initial conditions of the latter model . </S>",
