    "in recent years there has been increasing interest in how we can model complex systems using network theory .",

    "in particular , a network based approach of studying complex systems has become very popular in econophysics @xcite , an interdisciplinary research field that studies economic and financial phenomena .",
    "one of the important and fundamental problems in this approach is to filter the most relevant information from financial networks . as a result traditional algorithms from network theory",
    "have been adapted and some new methods have been introduced . in 1999",
    "mantegna @xcite introduced a method for finding a hierarchical arrangement for a portfolio of stocks by extracting the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) from the complete network of correlations of daily closing price returns for us stocks .",
    "this work has developed to include asset graphs ( ag ) as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and threshold networks @xcite , @xcite . building from the work by mantegna @xcite with the mst , one of the most recent developments was an algorithm proposed by tumminello _",
    "@xcite where the complete network can be filtered at a chosen level , by varying the genus of the resulting filtered graph .",
    "so if a graph is embedded on a surface with genus = @xmath3 , as @xmath3 increases the resulting graph becomes more complex and so reveals more information about the clusters formed , while keeping the same hierarchical tree as the corresponding mst .",
    "the simplest form of this graph is the planar maximally filtered graph ( pmfg ) , on surface @xmath4 .",
    "+ the pmfg is constructed in a similar way to the mst .",
    "specifically , for a graph with @xmath0 vertices , a weighted edge is associated with all paired vertices where the value of the edge is the similarity coefficient between the two vertices .",
    "the weighted edges @xmath5 are placed in descending order @xmath6 .",
    "the first edge @xmath7 is selected and a graph is constructed with @xmath7 and the two vertices that it connects .",
    "the ordered edges continue to be selected and added to the network structure only if the resulting network can be embedded into a plane i.e. can be drawn on a planar surface without edges crossing .",
    "( there are some tests for planarity based on kuratowski s theorem . for more details on these",
    "refer to hopcroft and tarjan @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm ends when all vertices @xmath8 are connected , using @xmath9 edges .",
    "+ mantegna @xcite illustrates how the mst can extract the hierarchical arrangement between the vertices of a correlation network ( in particular between stocks ) .",
    "similar to this , one of the key properties of the ag , threshold networks and pmfg is that cliques can form between the vertices in the network which can highlight relationships .",
    "_ @xcitecreates threshold networks to analyse the chinese stock market using a correlation threshold value @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the correlation coefficient between two stocks .",

    "@xcite state that _ `",
    "the financial interpretation of the clique in the stock correlation network is that it defines the set of stocks whose price fluctuations exhibit a similar behaviour . ' _ + the pmfg has proven to be an important tool for filtering the most relevant information from a network , particularly in correlation based networks that model the correlation between stock prices .",
    "for example , pozzi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite consider the level of risk and the returns on portfolio s selected using filtered graphs , including pmfg .",

    ", the pmfg can tell us about the clusters ( as mentioned above ) that form within the dataset , regardless of the network nature , as a result of the underlying topological properties of the network .",
    "@xcite introduce a technique to extract the cluster structure and detect the hierarchical organisation within a complex dataset .",
    "this method has been developed using the topological structure of the pmfg such as the separating 3-cliques which separate a graph into two disconnected parts .",
    "@xcite discuss the benefits of studying networks in terms of their surface embeddings . by considering the topology of the pmfg we can see that the basic structure ( or motif ) of the pmfg is a series of 3-cliques .",
    "consider a sphere , a surface with @xmath14 the pmfg separates the sphere into a sequence of triangular faces , with each vertex of the network belonging to a 3-clique .",
    "for a set of vertices there are various representations that this underlying series of 3-cliques can form ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "a set of three 3-cliques joined by the shared edges of a fourth 3-clique will form a 4-clique between a group of four vertices .",
    "@xcite discusses that there must be strong relations between the properties of these 4-cliques and the ones of the system from which the cliques have been generated . for the pmfg we consider the vertices that form the 3- and 4-cliques ( as the maximum number of elements that can form a clique is 4 ) .",
    "tumminello _ et al _ @xcite state _ ` ... normalizing quantities are @xmath15 for 4-cliques and @xmath16 for 3-cliques .",
    "although we lack a formal proof , our investigations suggest that these numbers are the maximal number of 4-cliques and 3-cliques , respectively , that can be observed in a pmfg of @xmath17 elements . '",
    "_ as well as looking at the average correlations within the cliques and whether the cliques are from one sector or cross - sector we also consider the ratio between the number of cliques that have formed to the maximum number of cliques that could form . for this , tumminello @xcite used the normalizing quantities that have been mentioned above , an approach that has also been used by refs .",

    "+ this paper is organised as follows : section 2 provides relational definitions and notations including diagonal flips ( 2.1 ) and surface triangles and separating 3-cycles ( 2.2 ) .",
    "section 3 discusses various representations of each maximal planar graph , including standard spherical triangulation form ( 3.1 ) .",
    "our main results are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 concludes and gives future direction for our research .",
    "here we introduce some key terminology that we use throughout the paper .",
    "consider a graph @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the set of vertices belonging to @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the set of edges belonging to @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the number of vertices @xmath22 and the number of edges @xmath23 . + let @xmath20 be a _ planar graph _ ,",
    "i.e. a graph that can be embedded in the plane in such a way that the edges of @xmath20 will only intersect at the end points ( the vertices of @xmath20 ) . the planar graph divides the plane into _ faces _ , with each face bound by a simple cycle of @xmath20 .",
    "the number of edges in this boundary is the _ degree _ of the face .",
    "the _ planar representations _ of @xmath20 are all possible isomorphic embeddings of @xmath20 in the plane . + a _ triangulation _ of a closed surface is a simple graph , one that does not contain self- or multiple - edges , which is embedded into the surface so that each face is a triangle and that two faces meet along at most one edge .",
    "a planar graph is _ maximal _ if it is triangulated because if a face has more than 3 edges we can add a diagonal edge . a pmfg is a triangulation of a sphere . within this paper",
    "we shall denote @xmath24 as a _ maximal planar graph _ with @xmath0 vertices . +",
    "a _ chord _ is an edge connecting two vertices of a cycle , which is not included in the cycle itself . for a graph @xmath24 , a cycle of length @xmath25 @xmath26",
    "is called a @xmath25-cycle , denoted as @xmath27 . a cycle",
    "@xmath28 is a _ pure chord - cycle _ if the interior of @xmath28 contains no vertices and all the interior faces of @xmath28 are triangles .",
    "if each of the cycles of 4 or more vertices within a graph has a chord , then the graph is called a _",
    "chordal graph_. a _ wheel graph _",
    ", denoted as @xmath29 , is a graph with @xmath30 formed by connecting a single vertex to all other vertices of an @xmath31-cycle .",
    "consider two triangular faces which share a common edge and form a quadrilateral , ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "negami @xcite defines a _ diagonal flip _ of an edge as replacing the existing common edge with a new edge between the other two vertices .",
    "a diagonal flip is only possible if the resulting quadrilateral does not contain any multiple edges .",
    "+          for a graph @xmath18 a subset of vertices @xmath32 is called a _ clique _ if the subgraph @xmath33 is a complete graph and is denoted as @xmath34 where @xmath35 as a result of kuratowski s theorem we know that the pmfg allows cliques up to a maximum size of 4 vertices and so in this paper we will consider cliques of sizes 3 and 4 .",
    "the 3-cliques can take the form of triangles on the surface ( a pure chord - cycle of length 3 that forms a face of the pmfg ) or a _ separating 3-cycle _ ( a 3-cycle where both the interior and exterior of @xmath36 contain one or more vertices ) , ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "+        the faces bounded by a cycle of edges are called _ finite faces _ whereas the unbounded face ( abc in figure 2 ) is called the _ infinite face_. as the pmfg is a triangulation of the sphere this unbounded infinite face will also form a triangle .",
    "+ in section 4 we will study the maximum number of 3-cliques possible in a pmfg , however we begin by studying the maximum number of triangles on the plane ( i.e. the maximum number of faces ) .",
    "to do this we use the handshaking lemma and euler s formula ( refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . for",
    "the remaining of this section let @xmath18 be a simple , undirected , finite planar graph .",
    "+    let @xmath20 be a pmfg with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath37 edges and @xmath38 faces",

    "+ we can substitute into euler s formula and obtain the following , + @xmath44 @xmath45    and similarly , + @xmath46 @xmath47    so for a pmfg , the triangulation of a sphere , we have a maximum number of @xmath48 surface triangles .",
    "in this section the various representations of planar graphs are presented , which are used to achieve the main results shown in section 4 .",
    "+ using the relationship between the number of edges and the sum of the vertex degree we can calculate the maximum sum of all vertex degrees for a pmfg with @xmath0 vertices . by considering all combinations of the possible degrees of each vertex we can see what embeddings would be possible and , from these , which would be planar graphs . the following worked example shows this more clearly .",
    "+ * example 1 . * take @xmath18 where @xmath49 then we know : + @xmath50 and so @xmath51 + then each vertex can have a degree value from the set \\{3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 } due to the restrictions that each vertex can be joined to all other vertices at most once ( the pmfg does not allow for multiple edges ) and the degree of each vertex must be at least 3 .",
    "from this set there are 53 possible combinations that would give the total degree sum of 36 and from these combinations 13 would produce a planar graph .",
    "graphs that have the same combination of vertex degrees and are isomorphic to each other are known as _ planar representations _ and they will have the same number of 3-cliques ( denoted @xmath52 ) and 4-cliques ( denoted @xmath53 ) , ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "for @xmath70 we select one of these pure chord - cycles and start by deleting the chord edge .",

    "in this paper we have discussed possible embeddings of @xmath0-vertex triangulations in the form of maximal planar graphs . we used the generating operations proposed by eberhard to construct these maximal planar graphs and have proven that the maximum number of 3-cliques that can exist in a maximal planar graph with @xmath0 vertices is @xmath101 and the maximum number of 4-cliques that can exist is @xmath102 , where the number of vertices @xmath30 .",
    "this is true for when a maximal planar graph is constructed using the pmfg algorithm .",
    "+ finally , we have shown how any maximal planar graph can be transformed to a standard spherical triangulation form retaining the original number of vertices and edges and that this structure will always contain the maximum number of 3- and 4- cliques .",
    "+ the work on pmfg has recently been extended to include partial correlation planar maximally filtered graphs ( pcpg ) which use partial correlations between the stocks as opposed to pearson correlations @xcite , @xcite .",
