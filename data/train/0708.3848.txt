    "one of the most intriguing questions of astrophysics and astronomy is the origin of the elements in the early universe , and how this relates to the first formation of structure .",
    "about 200,000 years after the big bang the epoch of structure formation emerged and the first stars were born from the initial , pristine baryonic matter . without any elements heavier than helium to provide cooling , the first stars that formed from the baryonic matter trapped in the emerging mini - dark matter halos were probably very massive , greater than 30@xmath0  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these massive stars burned through their available fuel in about one to two million years , exploded as supernovae , and dispersed the first elements heavier than helium into the nascent universe , or collapsed into black holes .",
    "these first events of stellar evolution influenced their early universe neighborhood , and determined under which conditions and with which initial abundance low - mass stars with masses like the sun eventually formed .",
    "these take about 100 to 1000 times longer to form than more massive stars .",
    "thus , by the time the first low - mass stars formed there was already a small amount of heavier elements present .",
    "such low - mass stars are really the second stars , stars which formed from a non - primordial abundance distribution .",
    "these second stars are important because while the massive first stars have long since vanished , some second stars are still around .",
    "their importance lies in their capacity as carriers of the information about the formation and evolution of those long gone first generations of stars .",
    "the second stars are also important because of the nuclear production they are capable of by themselves ( for example the first s - process in the second stars ) .",
    "observations of such second stars are now emerging in increasing quantity and with high - resolution spectroscopic abundance determination @xcite .",
    "there are a number of strategies to find ultra and extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "the most effective appears to be spectroscopic surveys .",
    "most of the emp and ump stars have been discovered in the hk survey @xcite and the hamburg / eso survey ( he s * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here ,",
    "i designate somewhat arbitrarily ultra metal - poor ( ump ) stars as those with @xmath1 } } } \\leq -3.5 $ ] ( @xmath2 ) and extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars as those with @xmath1 } } } \\leq -1.8 $ ] ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "emp stars include the most metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "ump stars are rare and hard to find in the spectroscopic surveys .",
    "only approximately a dozen have been reported so far , with the present record holder he 0107 - 5240 at @xmath1 } } } = -5.4 $ ] @xcite . at and below this metallicity spectral features",
    "are so weak that even the 10 m class telescopes are barely suitable for the job .",
    "the formation mode of the second stars depends on a complex history of events , each of which may leave signatures in the observed abundances of emp and in particular the ump stars .",
    "these events include the ionizing radiation of the very first primordial stars and the expansion of the associated h ii regions , their effect on possibly primordial star formation in neighboring mini - dark matter halos , as well as possibly the metal enrichment from a pair - instability supernova , depending on the mass of the first primordial stars .",
    "these processes and the cosmological assumption that fix the underlying dark - matter structure will eventually determine the abundance distribution of the emp and ump stars now discovered and analyzed .",
    "the most recent studies confirm that the very first primordial stars are massive @xcite .",
    "however in these calculations the effect of the ionization from star formation in nearby mini - dark matter halos is taken into account , and it is found that the following generation of primordial stars may include intermediate mass stars .",
    "the most metal - poor stars are potentially an extremely powerful tool to study star formation and evolution in the early universe @xcite .",
    "these stars with metallicities reaching in excess of 5 orders of magnitude in metallicity below the solar metallicity often show abundance distributions that are very different from the solar abundance distribution .",
    "the solar abundance distribution is the result of a long galactic chemical evolution , reflecting the cumulative result of mixing and nuclear processing of many generations of stars of a wide range of masses .",
    "the most metal - poor stars are very old and have formed very early , at the onset of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the abundance pattern in these second stars are the result of only few different sources and corresponding stellar nuclear production sites .",
    "the goal is to identify these nuclear production sites and the mechanisms and processes through which the corresponding stellar ejecta have been brought together in the star formation cloud of the second stars .",
    "an important part of the problem is to account for self - pollution or external pollution events that may have altered the stellar abundances between the time of second star formation and observation .",
    "as the number of emp and ump stars with detailed abundance continuously grows one can discern certain abundance patterns .",
    "a very unusual sub - group are the carbon - rich emp and ump stars .",
    "observations indicate that many of these stars are polluted by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) binary companions .",
    "this implies that reliable models of agb stars including their heavy element production through the s - process at extremely low metallicity are required to understand these stars , and to disentangle the agb contribution from other sources that have contributed to the observed abundance patterns . in the following section",
    "the carbon - rich emp and ump stars will be discussed in more detail . in  [ sec : improve ] current models of emp intermediate mass stars and their uncertainties are presented .",
    "such models have important applications for the emerging field of near - field cosmology , which uses galactic and extra - galactic stellar abundances to reconstruct the processes that lead to the formation of our and other galaxies (  [ sec : nfc ] ) .",
    "then , ongoing work  both observational and theoretical  to determine the nucleosynthesis of nitrogen at extremely low metallicity is described (  [ sec : nitrogen ] ) and  [ sec : hingba ] covers the hydrogen - ingestion flash in born - again giants , because this type of events may be important for emp agb stars as well , and may indeed be a major source of nitrogen in these stars .",
    " [ sec : spr ] deals with the , and how it can be used as a diagnostic tool to improve the physics understanding of stellar mixing",
    ". finally , and before some forward lookgin concluding remarks (  [ sec : concl ] ) the importance of nuclear physics input for the question of c - star formation will be discussed in  [ sec : enrt ] .",

    "many of the heavier elements , like ti , cr , mn or zn in cs 29497 - 030 are either not overabundant or rather somewhat underabundant compared to the solar distribution .",
    "large overabundances of n and na are not predicted by standard models of massive stars , neither for pop iii @xcite nor at larger metallicity @xcite",
    ". primary production of n requires to expose the he - burning product c to h - burning again .",
    "such a condition is encountered in massive agb stars during hot - bottom burning @xcite .",
    "na is made in c - burning in massive stars but its final abundance is sensitive to the neutron excess , and thus scales less than linear with metallicity . if primary @xmath9  is exposed to he - burning it will lead to the production of @xmath10 .",
    "either an additional proton collected in hot - bottom burning , or a neutron from the @xmath11 reaction in the he - shell flash of agb stars can then lead to primary @xmath12  production .",
    "this process leads to significant na overabundances in standard agb stellar models of very low or zero metallicity @xcite .",
    "the overabundances of c , n and na are not the only indication that the abundances in c - rich emp stars are at least partly caused by agb stellar evolution .",
    "all of the objects mentioned above , and in fact most c - rich emp stars show in some cases significant overabundances of the s - process elements .",
    "in addition they reveal their binarity through radial velocity variations , corresponding to binary periods of a few days in the case of he 0024 - 2523 @xcite to more typically one to a dozen years .",
    "in fact , in their statistical analysis @xcite find that observations of radial velocities of cemp - s stars ( c - rich emp stars with s - process signature ) obtained to date is consistent with a @xmath13 binarity rate of cemp - s stars .",
    "he 0107 - 5420 is currently the intrinsically most metal - poor star with @xmath1 } } } = -5.3 $ ] .",
    "however , the total metal abundance in terms of elements heavier than he is quite large . in particular",
    "the cno elements are significantly overabundant compared to the solar abundance ratios , with @xmath5 } } } = + 4.0 $ ] , @xmath6 } } } = + 2.4 $ ] @xcite , and @xmath7 } } } = + 2.3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the large overabundance alone indicate that only a few nuclear sources were involved in creating this abundance pattern . together with the low fe abundance the large cno abundances require a primary production of the cno elements . a primary nucleosynthesis production chain in a star is based only on the primordial elements h and he .",
    "a secondary production in contrast requires heavier elements already to be present in the initial element mix at the time of star formation .",
    "for example , standard models of massive stars predict a secondary production of n from cno cycling of c and o that is initially present from earlier generations of stars .",
    "he 0107 - 5420 is a good example to discuss the possible nuclear production sites that may be important at the lowest metallicities",
    ". certainly the production of the first massive pop iii stars plays an important role . @xcite",
    "have discussed the observed abundance pattern within the framework of mixing and fallback of the ejecta during the explosion of supernovae that eventlually form a black hole .",
    "they show that the mixing and fallback parameters can be chosen in a way that accounts for much of the observed pattern .",
    "for example , their model correctly reflects the large observed fe / ni ratio , and the large c / fe and c / mg ratios .",
    "the model does predict a significant n overabundance but it quantitatively falls short of matching the observed value .",
    "their model predicts the charactereistic odd - even effect that reflects the small ( or missing ) neutron - excess of the primordial nuclear fuel .",
    "one of the observed species that hints that he 0107 - 5420 may not have such a pronounced odd - even pattern is na .",
    "the observerved overabundance is @xmath8 } } } = 0.8 $ ] , more than 1.5 dex above the model prediction from the mixing and fallback supernova .",
    "unfortunately , for the heavy trans - iron elements only upper limits could be derived so far , which prohibits definite access to the s- and r - process abundances in he 0107 - 5420 . at this point na and to a lesser extent n are the major indicators that some additional sources are part of the nuclear production site inventory that caused the abundance pattern in this most metal - poor star .    without better guidance from ab - initio coupled structure and star formation simulations  such as shown in fig.[fig : dmhalo ]  several scenarios have to be considered .",
    "material from the first supernova could be ejected from the corresponding halo and injected into a neighbouring halo .",
    "this metal enrichment could lead to the formation of an intermediate mass star , for example a very massive agb star , maybe even a super - agb star that eventually ends in a onemg core - collapse supernova .",
    "as shown in ",
    "[ sec : improve ] a contribution from such stars can account for both na as well as n , but more detailed models of this particular scenario need to be done for quantitative comparison . a low - mass star like he 0107 - 5420",
    "could then form from the combined nuclear production of these two sources , a roughly @xmath14 black hole forming supernova and a massive agb or super - agb star .    alternatively the low - mass star forms from the ejecta of just one supernova , and this initial abundance pattern is modified by self - polution .",
    "he 0107 - 5420 is in fact a giant on the first ascent .",
    "observations , in particular of globular cluster red giants show that mixing and nuclear processing of c into n below the deep convective envelope lead to secondary n production @xcite .",
    "this could explain the quantitative discrepancy between the observed n abundance and the model by @xcite .",
    "however , the rather large carbon isotopic ratio @xmath15 implies that self - polution can not account for the observed na abundance , in particular assuming the absence of @xmath10which is a secondary nucleosynthesis product in massive stars .",
    "this leads to the external polution scenario that is frequently considered in this context . as mentioned above many cemp stars",
    "are in fact in binary systems , and the abundance signatures seen in these c - rich very metal - poor stars could be  in part  the result of mass transfer from the agb progenitor of a white dwarf companion . for he 0107 - 5420 @xcite discuss this possibility in detail .",
    "for the evolution of primordial agb stars they consider the possibility of the h - ingestion flash , a process in which the he - shell flash convection zone reaches outward into the h - rich envelope , resulting in a peculiar nucleosynthesis and mixing regime .",
    "such events are known at solar metallicity to cause a significant fraction of young white dwarfs to evolve for a short period of time back to the agb ( born - again evolution ,  [ sec : hingba ] ) , and the most prominent representative of this class of objects is sakurai s object @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section the evolution of low- and intermediate mass stars at zero or extremely or ultra metal - poor abundance is essential for studying the most metal - poor stars and their cosmological origin and environment . this section deals first with the evolution of agb stars that may have formed from big bang material . a possibly important evolutionary phase -",
    "the h - ingestion flash triggered by the he - shell flash - has been observed in models of pop iii and even in models of non - zero but ultra - low metal content (  [ sec : hflash ] ) . finally the evolution and yields of extremely metal - poor tp - agb stars is described .",
    "the evolution of pop iii massive stars is discussed , for example , by @xcite .",
    "simulations show that many of the overall properties of pop iii intermediate mass stellar models @xcite probably apply to ultra metal - poor stars as well . at @xmath16",
    "the initial thermal pulses may show peculiar convective mixing events at the core - envelope boundary during or after the actual he - shell flash .",
    "but eventually the models enter a phase of rather normal thermal pulse agb evolution , with regular thermal pulse cycles , third dredge - up , hot - bottom burning and mass loss . many uncertainties of the pop iii stellar evolution is related to the possibility of flash - burning that is not yet well understood (  [ sec : hflash ] ) .",
    "@xmath16 stellar evolution is different from evolution at higher metal content because cno catalytic material for h - burning is initially absent .",
    "burning hydrogen via the pp - chain requires a higher temperature than h - burning via the cno cycle .",
    "eventually the triple-@xmath17 process will provide some c , and a mass fraction as low as @xmath18 is sufficient to switch h - core burning to cno cycling . during he - core burning",
    "some c is produced outside the convective core and a tail of carbon reaches from the convective core out toward the h - shell .",
    "after the end of he - core burning , and depending on the initial mass , this carbon and some nitrogen is mixed into the envelope . according to @xcite this second dredge - up raises the envelope c - abundance above @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "for such a c - abundance the h - shell is fully supported by cno cycling . as a result",
    "the thermal pulse agb evolution is like that of the ultra metal - poor cases .",
    "models with initial masses below @xmath21 show a peculiarity that is unknown in more metal - rich models .",
    "after an initial series of weak thermal pulses the h - shell forms a convection zone when it re - ignites after the he - shell flash @xcite .",
    "the lower boundary of this convection zone is highly unstable , because it coincides with the opacity discontinuity that marks the core - envelope interface .",
    "even small amounts of mixing will drive flash - like burning and deep mixing , as protons enter a @xmath22-rich zone .",
    "it seems that the details of the evolution of the h - shell convection zone is not important as this one - time event leads to deep dredge - up and enrichment of the envelope with a sufficient amount to support regular cno cylce burning in the h - shell thereafter .",
    "accordingly , these lower - mass cases will evolve like extremely metal - poor stars too , and the @xmath16 models discussed here can be used as proxies for what is in reality born as an ultra metal - poor star .",
    "the effect of rotationally induced mixing processes may alter the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars and very low metallicity even before the the agb and lead to a qualitatively different thermal pulse evolution . @xcite",
    "describe models for metallicity @xmath23 in which @xmath22  and @xmath24  is mixed out of the he - burning core and up to the location of the h - shell .",
    "this leads to an increase of cno material , in particular @xmath9  in the envelope that could result in a rather normal thermal pulse evolution without any peculiar hydrogen convection zone . whether the rotationally induced",
    "mixing processes before the agb or the subsequent thermal pulse agb evolution with the associated dredge - up events dominate the final cno yields is not yet clear .",
    "the difference between a real pop iii and an extremely metal - poor thermal pulse agb star is the initial absence of fe and other elements heavier than al in the pop iii star .",
    "this does not preclude that a pop iii agb stars can not generate -elements by the slow neutron capture process .",
    "@xcite have used the -framework established for solar - like metallicities (  [ sec : spr ] ) and ran network calculations with an initial abundance appropriate for the interior of a @xmath16 tp - agb star .",
    "they used the models of @xcite as stellar evolution input .",
    "the major uncertainty was the mixing for the formation of the neutron donor species @xmath25 , and the unknown feedback of such mixing to the thermodynamic structure evolution . @xcite and @xcite have shown that this feedback is likely very important . nevertheless , the -models for @xmath16 are instructive , because they show that if a sufficient neutron source is available , the  can be based on seed nuclei with lower mass number than fe , for example c. c is produced in a primary mode in tp - agb stars .",
    "for such a @xmath16  the fe / ni ratio should be markedly sub - solar , approximately close to the quasi steady - state value of @xmath26 , that is given by the ratio of the neutron cross sections of ni and fe ( the isotopic minimum for each element ) .",
    "he 0107 - 5240 with @xmath1}}}=-5.3 $ ] @xcite shows a larger than solar fe / ni ratio , which is evidence for the contribution of supernovae to the abundace distribution of this star .",
    "the peculiar h - convective episode described in the previous section was observed in agb models with of @xmath27 and @xmath16 by @xcite . during the following thermal pulse the he - shell flash convection zone reachea out into the h - rich envelope .",
    "this leads to the h - ingestion flash ( hif ) .",
    "protons are mixed on the convective time scale into the he - shell flash region which is with depth increasingly hot .",
    "the hydrogen flash - burning leads to a separate convection zone as shown in fig.[fig : ff08348 ] .",
    "convective h - burning in this layer is characterized by a large abundance of @xmath22  and protons .",
    "the protons have been mixed into this region from the envelope . accordingly",
    "the @xmath9  abundance in this layer is very large , up to @xmath28 by mass in a layer of @xmath29 .",
    "the models show that after both the he - shell flash and the hif have subsided a deep dredge - up episode will mix this @xmath9-rich layer into the envelope . this may account for a substantial @xmath9  production and part of the observational pattern observed in emp stars that are believed to be poluted by emp agb stars (  [ sec : nitrogen ] ) .",
    "a hif was also found in the @xmath30 , @xmath16 model , but @xcite did not find the hif in models of @xmath31 .",
    "agb stars are highly non - linear systems .",
    "the occurrence of the hif depends on many details of the models , including the physics of mixing , opacities , the numerical resolution and nuclear reaction rates .",
    "small changes in any of these ingredients , that may go unnoticed during a more robust stellar evolution phase ( like the main - sequence ) , can be the deciding factor here whether a hif occurs or not .",
    "currently , theoretical models do not agree if and in which initial mass and metallicity regime the hif occurs @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to better understand this situation because the hif may play an important role in the  in extremely metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "hydrogen ingested into the he - shell flash or pulse - driven convection zone ( pdcz ) may lead to @xmath25  production which could release neutrons . @xcite",
    "propose that the abundance pattern of the currently most metal - poor star ",
    "he 0107 - 5420  is in part due to the nucleosynthesis in a thermal pulse agb star with hif .",
    "the details of the nucleosynthesis in a hif depend sensitively on the physics of simultaneous rapid nuclear burning and convective mixing .",
    "the hydrogen - ingestion flash can also be a source of lithium , distinctly different from conditions during hot - bottom burning @xcite .",
    "the evolution of born - again stars , like sakurai s object , provide valuable additional constraints with regard to the hif in agb stars (  [ sec : hingba ] ) .",
    "the very late thermal pulse is associated with a hif @xcite . by reproducing the evolution of stars like sakurai s object one can gain some confidence in models of the hif in metal - poor agb stars .",
    "@xcite showed that models in which the convective hydrogen ingestion occurs with lower velocities than predicted by the mixing - length theory @xcite feature a faster born - again evolution than mlt models , quantitatively in agreement with observations .",
    "the physical interpretation is that rapid nuclear burning on the convective time scale releases energy and adds buoyancy to down - flowing convective bubbles , leading to additional breaking of the plumes .",
    "the temperature and time scales for nucleosynthesis during the hif would be significantly different .",
    "this has not yet been applied to hif models at @xmath16 or extremely low metallicity .      by definition",
    "all yields of pop iii stars are primary , because the initial composition contains only big bang material .",
    "nuclear production is secondary when nuclei heavier than h and he are already present in the initial abundance distribution and transformed in other species .",
    "pop iii or emp agb stars can produce a large number of species in primary mode , including the cno elements , ne , na , mg and al .",
    "the production of heavier elements depends on the availabilitity of neutrons .",
    "some of these primary species , like oxygen , are usually not considered a product of agb evolution at moderate metal - deficiency or solar metallicity . however , the initial envelope mass fraction of oxygen for models with @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath24  in the intershell material ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : kipp ] ) that is dredged - up is primary and even at this low metallicity of the order @xmath34 by mass .",
    "dredge - up of such material will enhance the envelope abundance significantly .",
    "a set of low- and intermediate mass agb stellar evolution models with @xmath32 ( [ fe / h ] = -2.3 ) with detailed structure , nucleosynthesis and yield predictions has been presented by @xcite . the oxygen overabundance in these models is @xmath35 , depending on mass . the abundance evolution for c , n , o and na is shown in fig.[fig : nacno ] for two initial masses .",
    "the evolution of c and n is qualitatively different in the two cases .",
    "the lower mass sequence shows the increase of c and some o due to the repeated dredge - up events .",
    "no significant amount of @xmath9  is dredged - up .",
    "the result is a large c / n ratio .",
    "the @xmath27 track shows the opposite behaviour .",
    "the much lower c / n ratio is the result of hot - bottom burning @xcite .",
    "c and o are dredged - up after the thermal pulse as in the lower mass case , but during the following quiescent intperpulse phase the envelope convection reaches into the region hot enough for h - burning and the envelope c is transformed into n. the initial - mass transition between hot - bottom burning models with large n abdundances and c dredge - up models without hot - bottom burning is very sharp .",

    "the signature of hot - bottom burning in fig.[fig : nacno ] is a gradual change of abundance between the steps caused by dredge - up . from this",
    "it can be seen that na has a different nuclear production site depending on initial mass . in the @xmath30 case",

    "@xmath12  is the dredged - up but not produced during the interpulse phase .",
    "the neutron - heavy mg isotope @xmath37  is produced in a similar way . in the @xmath27 case",
    "na is mainly produced in hot - bottom burning , by p - capture on dredged - up @xmath10 .    in the previous section",
    "it was argued that due to the large primary production of cno and many other species the @xmath16 model predictions would also apply approximately to stars with ultra - low metallicity as well .",
    "neutron capture reactions play an important role , and need to be included in yield - predictions , together with a neutron - sink approximation for species not explicitely included in the network .",
    "this has been done in a qualitatively similar way by both @xcite for the @xmath32 models and @xcite for their @xmath16 models , and the abundance evolution is quantitatively similar .",
    "both model sets predict for non - hot - bottom burning cases large primary production of c and o , while the @xmath9  abundance does not change .",
    "@xmath10  is produced in both cases in the he - shell flashes , and in both cases",
    "the final @xmath10  exceeds that of @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath38  and @xmath37  is qualitatively the same too .",

    "this is in particular interesting as these low - mass agb models predict that @xmath39 , contrary to the signature of hot - bottom burning .",
    "one of the largest uncertainties is the adopted mass loss .",
    "while mass loss in agb stars of solar metallicity can be constraint observationally , this has not been possible for extremely low metallicity .",
    "other uncertainties relate to mixing in emp agb stars .",
    "@xcite has shown that convection induced extra - mixing , like exponential overshoot that is used to generate a @xmath25  pocket for the  in higher - metallicity models , may lead to vigorous h - burning during the third dredge - up . depending on the efficiency of such mixing the third dredge - up",

    "ba is typically considered an main - component  element ( at least at @xmath1 } } } > -2 $ ] ) because the elemental solar abundance has a @xmath42  contribution @xcite .",
    "only the smaller remaining fraction is made in the r - process .",
    "as discussed above , the nuclear production site of the main - component of the s - process are low- and intermediate mass agb stars , in the initial mass range @xmath43 .",
    "this component of galaxy chemical evolution needs even more time to contribute than the sn ia . and",
    "indeed , [ ba / fe ] behaves differently from @xmath40}}}$ ] in halo stars and satellite stars .",
    "[ ba / fe ] is on average higher in the satellite stars than in halo stars , with a considerable spread .",
    "this is consistent with the framework of truncated chemical evolution of systems that were early disrupted in merger events , and with the understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis that @xmath17-elements are predominanty made in short - lived massive stars , while ba originates in rather old populations .",
    "it is then extremely interesting to consider the r - process element eu , which in the solar abundance distribution has a very small  contribution of only @xmath44 .",
    "this element does not behave like @xmath17-elements . instead , [ eu / fe ] is on average the same in halo stars and dwarf galaxy stars , however with a larger spread in the latter . in order to remain in the proposed scenario of why abundances in the halo differ from those in the nearby dwarf galaxies one",
    "would then have to assume that at least an important fraction of the r - process elements does not originate in sn ii , which eject their yields on a short time scale .",
    "instead , one would have to assume that eu in the satellite stars comes from a source that releases the ejecta on a time scale comparable to or longer than the fe production in sn ia .",
    "such sources could be the accretion induced collapse @xcite or the collapse of a super - agb star in the initial mass range @xmath45 , if the core mass grows to the chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "it would certainly go to far at this point to draw any further conclusion , for example in conjunction with the two r - porcess source model proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is clear , that the full potential of using the abundances patterns of stars to reconstruct the formation of galaxies in their cosmological context can only be reached with detailed yield predictions including all masses and reaching down to extremely low metallicity .",
    "y is another example that reinforces this notion . in the solar abundance distribution",
    "it has a @xmath46 fraction from the main - component  originating in low - mass stars .",
    "however , it is also the termination point of the weak  from massive stars , and it does have some r - porcess contribution . in the data presented by @xcite",

    "nitrogen is the fifth most common element in the universe . in stellar evolution of very low metallicity",
    "the primary production is of particular importance . strictly from a nucleosynthesis point of view nitrogen is always made in a well established sequence of events , involving first the triple-@xmath17 process that makes @xmath22  and then two subsequent proton captures that are part of the cn - cylce . in a stellar model sequence the problem is to identify the mixing processes that can account for this sequence of events . how can @xmath22 , that is made in the he - burning that requires higher temperatures , be brought into layers of lower temperature where h - burning still takes place .",

    "nitrogen is certainly present in the most metal - poor stars in the milky way @xcite . according to standard stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models primary",
    "n comes from intermediate mass ( i m ) agb stars @xcite , with perhaps a small contribution from rotating massive stars @xcite . in agb",
    "stars the repeating sequence of thermal pulses induce convective mixing events that lead to the prodution of n. c is made in the he - shell flash .",
    "dredge - up after the flash mixes that c into the envelope , and in massive agb stars the c in the envelope is then transformed into n. the low [ n/@xmath17 ] abundances observed in some damped lyman-@xmath17 systems @xcite have prompted suggestions that the imf may be biased in favor of massive stars in some systems @xcite , or that these systems represent the earliest stages of chemical evolution of massive stars only @xcite .",
    "observations of n and c abundances in c - rich emp stars with -signature provide another way to study the n production at low metallicity .",
    "about 30@xmath48 of all extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] < -2 ) are strongly c- and to a lesser extent n - enhanced (  [ sec : cemp ] ) .",
    "in particular the overabundance of c and of n in addition to their s - process signature has lead to the assumption that the agb star progenitor of the current white dwarf companion to the cemp - s star is responsible for the observed abundance pattern .",

    "nitrogen ] the [ c / n ] and [ c / fe ] ratios of literature data are shown , together with the agb model prediction of @xmath49 - @xmath21 tracks .",
    "the literature data show systematically lower [ c / n ] ratios than what is expected by @xmath49 or @xmath50 models that dredge - up c , but do not produce n. this poses the question of the primary origin of the n in theses stars .",
    "models of initial masses between 4 and 6 feature efficient hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) which turns most dredged - up primary carbon into nitrogen resulting in [ c / n]<-1 and [ c / fe]<1.5 .",
    "however , none of the literature data seem to show the very low [ c / n ] ratio that would be expected for an emp star that happened to have an agb companion in the @xmath51 initial mass range .",
    "we have carried out observations of emp targets with 0.5<[c / fe]<1 using the ch and the nh band for abundance determination @xcite .",
    "specifically we wanted to find out whether the paucity of emp stars with [ c / n]<-1 is a selection effect or a systematic observational bias imposed by the abundance indicators employed in previous studies .",
    "while c - strong stars can be identified by the g - band at @xmath52 , the strong nh band at @xmath53is never observed in the medium - resolution surveys that provide the targets for detailed abundance studies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "only the cn bands at @xmath54and @xmath55are included , and cn lines are not strong in n - rich stars unless c is also enhanced by a large amount .",

    ". we did not find any stars with low [ c / n ] , and the analysis of additional data is underway to put our findings on a more robust statistical basis .",
    "this leaves us with two important open questions : ( 1 ) where are the emp stars polluted by massive agb stars ? and ( 2 ) where does the n in the cemp stars come from that we do observe ?",
    "while we do not have any idea at this point of what the answer to the first question could be , there are a number of possibilities to address the absence of primary n. these include rotationally induced mixing before the agb phase (  [ sec : z00 ] ) , the h - ingestion flash (  [ sec : hflash ] ) , and extra - mixing in agb stars @xcite as envoked in models of rgb stars to account for abundance anomalies in globular cluster member stars @xcite . in any of these cases",
    "the interpretation of n abundances in metal - poor systems of all kinds may have to be re - evaluated .",
    "nuclear production in the agb stellar interior can become observable at a later time in the evolution , during the post - agb phase , on the surface of those central stars of planetary nebulae that become h - deficient . here",
    "h - deficient means in most cases that the mass fraction of h as observed in the stellar spectrum is less than @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to additional important constraints on the evolution of agb stars , which is in particular important to study agb evolution at extremely low metallicitiy .",
    "h - deficient central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) as well as very young white dwarfs have been analysed in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and new important information about the abundances of these stars is yet to be revealed .",
    "stellar evolution predicts that about @xmath57 of all post - agb stars will eventually loose all their small remaining h - rich envelope mass of the order @xmath58 and expose the bare h - free cores .",
    "the carbon , oxygen and helium rich nature of these objects is evident from their wolf - rayet or pg1159 type emission line spectra , and reflects nuclear processed material that has been built up during the stars progenitor evolution .",
    "although there is considerable spread in the observed abundances of these stars , the pattern can be summarized in mass fraction as he @xmath59 c @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these h - deficient cspn are important for agb evolution modeling , because they provide a unique opportunity to study directly the nuclear processing shells in agb stars . in order to explain the evolutionary origin @xcite introduced the born - again evolution scenario .",
    "the star evolves off the agb , and becomes a hydrogen - rich central star and eventually a very hot , young white dwarf .",
    "however , the he - shell may still be capable to ignite a late he - shell flash , and in that case the star retraces its evolution in the hrd , back into the giant region ( fig.[fig : hrdsak ] ) . as a result of hydrogen - ingestion into the he - convection and rapid burning , or by mixing from the emerging convective envelope ( or because of both )",
    "the surface abundance of such born - again stars will be extremely h - deficient or even h - free .",
    "stellar models of this evolutionary origin scenario connect the surface abundance of the wolf - rayet central stars and the pg1159 stars with the intershell abundance of the progenitor agb star .",
    "the intershell layer between the he- and the h - shell is well mixed during each he - shell flash .",
    "this zone contains the main nuclear production site of the progenitor agb star , and the abundance of this zone reflects contributions from both he- and h - shell burning ( fig.[fig : kipp ] ) . as a result of the born - again evolution",
    "these layers become visible at the surface of the resulting h - deficient cspn .",
    "the initial models of the h - deficient central stars by iben and collaborators showed qualitatively that the born - again scenario could account for high he and c abundances , as these elements were abundant in the intershell of the agb progenitor model they used .",
    "however , they could not account for the high observed oxygen abundance .",
    "@xcite were the first to propose that the solution could be non - standard mixing during the agb evolution .",
    "models with overshooting at the bottom of the pulse - driven convection zone do not only feature higher temperatures at the bottom of that layer (  [ sec : spr - mix ] ) , but they also show higher c and in particular o abundances in the pdcz .",
    "subsequently , @xcite has explored in detail how the various abundances depend on the overshoot efficiency and other details .",
    "in essence , overshooting brings agb intershell abundances of he , c and o in very good quantitative agreement with the observed abundances of wolf - rayet type central stars and pg1159 stars , in the framework of the born - again evolution .",
    "more effort is needed to consolidate these constraints on the intershell abundance with the possibly tight upper limits on overshooting at the bottom of the pdcz that the  may provide (  [ sec : spr - mix ] ) .",
    "the connection of the surface abundances of the hot pg1159 stars and the progenitor agb intershell abundance has been reinforced recently by several new observational findings .",
    "these include a substantial overabundance of ne @xcite , f abundances ranging from solar up to 250 times solar @xcite in good agreement with agb nucleosynthesis predictions by @xcite , and fe - deficiencies of at least 1 dex compared to solar @xcite , which may reflect the depeletion of fe in the agb intershell due to  n - captures . in that case",
    "the fe / ni ratio should be low , as in fact observed in sakurai s object .",
    "this born - again star is the smoking gun of the very late thermal pulse scenario and links this evolutionary scenario with the h - deficient pg 1159 and wolf - rayet type central stars @xcite .",
    "much of the observed abundance pattern of sakurai s object as well as the rapid evolutionary time scale has been reproduced quantitatively with stellar models @xcite .",
    "similar to the pg 1159 stars , sakurai s object shows fe depletion of about 1dex compared to solar .",
    "the low ratio of @xmath62 , shows that sakurai s object shows surface material that has been directly irradiated with neutrons @xcite .",
    "new radio observations show that sakurai s object has started reheating again , on its second evolution into the cspn @xcite .",
    "this marks a new phase of the evolution of this star , and confirms the concept of convective mixing efficiency modified by nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "the  is the origin of half of all elements heavier than iron @xcite .",
    "it is also important for isotopic ratios and in some cases elemental abundances of lighter elements - in particular at extremely low metallicity .",

    "observations and theory agree that the nuclear production site of the main and strong component of the ( @xmath65 ) originates in low mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the weak component below the first  peak at @xmath66 is produced during he and c burning in massive stars .",
    "here we deal only with the  in agb stars .",
    "the  is important in the context of the second stars for two reasons .",
    "first , the observed elemental abundance distribution of the trans - iron elements is at any given metallicitiy a mix of s- and r - process contribution . in order to disentangle the two contributions in very - low metallicity stars ,",
    "the  in this metallicity regime needs to be understood .",
    "this may than enable progress in identifying the conditions for the r - process .",
    "second , -branchings can be used to probe the physics for stellar mixing (  [ sec : spr - diag ] ) , which is particularly usefull when modeling the evolution of emp stars .",
    "the  in low - mass agb stars has two neutron sources .",
    "the main source is @xmath25 , that forms via the @xmath67 reaction . at the end of the dredge - up phase ( fig.[fig : kipp ] ) after the he - shell flash , when the bottom of the h - rich convective envelope has penetrated into the @xmath22  rich intershell layer , partial mixing at this interface would create a thin layer providing simultaneously the required protons and @xmath22 .",
    "the  in the @xmath25  pocket is characterized by low neutron densities ( @xmath68 ) that last for several thousand years under radiative , convectively stable conditions during the quiescent interpulse phase .",
    "the physics of mixing at the h/@xmath22  interface at the end of the third dredge - up phase has not yet been clearly identified ( see below ) .",
    "most likely it is some type of convection induced mixing beyond the convection boundary .",
    "the @xmath11 reaction requires the high temperatures that can be found at the bottom of the pulse - driven convection zone ( pdcz ) during the he - shell flash ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the neutrons are released with high density ( @xmath70 ) in a short burst @xcite .",
    "these peak neutron densities are realised for only about a year , followed by a neutron density tail that lasts a few years , depending on the stellar model assumptions .",
    "the current quantitative modeling of the  uses the thermodynamic output from a stellar evolution calculation including mass loss as input for nucleosynthesis calculations with a complete  network @xcite .",
    "the post - processing accounts for both the @xmath25   neutron source as well as for the @xmath10  source , and mixes the different contributions according to the information provided by the stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the free parameter of the model is the @xmath25  abundance in the @xmath25  pocket that is proportional to the neutron exposure that results from burning the @xmath25  in the @xmath71 reaction .",
    "physical mixing processes which are responsible for bringing protons down from the envelope into the @xmath22-rich core to enable @xmath25  formation , are not explicitely included in this model .",
    "observationally , models have to account for observed spread in observables that are related to the neutron exposure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this spread is not only evident from stellar spectroscopy , but also from sic grain data , that indicate that a spread by a factor of five is necessary for the neutron exposure for a given mass and metallicity @xcite . currently , this spread is accounted for by a range of different cases in each of which the @xmath25  abundance in the pocket is assumed to be different @xcite .",
    "however , the physics of the mixing that is associated with the range of neutron exposures has yet to be identified .",
    "it is useful to distinguish -mixing for solar and moderately metal - poor stellar evolution , and the extremely and ultra metal - poor cases . in the first , the assumption that -mixing does not feedback strongly into the thermodynamic evolution is generally valid , in the latter it is generally not .",
    "many more observational constraints exist for the solar and moderately metal - poor , in particular the isotopic information from the pre - solar sic grains .",
    "mixing for the for the solar and moderately metal - poor  has to satisfy two general constraints : ( 1 ) how is the partial mixing zone of h and @xmath22  generated that eventually forms the neutron source species @xmath25 , and ( 2 ) what is the origin of the observed spread in neutron exposures .",
    "mixing for the @xmath25  pocket is probably related to the penetrative evolution of the bottom of the convective envelope during the third dredge - up .",
    "possible mechanisms include exponential diffusive overshooting @xcite , mixing induced by rotation @xcite , and mixing by internal gravity waves @xcite .",
    "each of these effectively leads to a continuously and quickly decreasing mixing efficiency from the h - rich convection zone into the radiative @xmath22-rich layer , and each of these will lead to the formation of two pockets which are overlapping @xcite . at low h/@xmath22  ratios h - burning is proton - limited , and protons will make @xmath25  via the @xmath72 reaction but no ( or little ) @xmath9 . at larger h/@xmath22  ratio a @xmath9pocket forms",
    "the maximum abundance of both @xmath25  and @xmath9  depends on the @xmath22  abundance in the intershell . therefore , the conditions in the @xmath25  pocket are not independent of , for example , the mixing at the bottom of the pdcz .",
    "@xcite derive the relationship @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the intershell @xmath22  mass fraction and @xmath75 is the maximum neutron exposure reached in the @xmath25pocket .",
    "the observations of h - deficient post - agb stars described in ",
    "[ sec : hingba ] require that the @xmath22  abundance in the pdcz of agb stars is about @xmath76 .",
    "this value is reproduced in agb stellar evolution models with overshooting at the bottom of the pdcz , and about twice as large as in models without overshooting .",
    "apart from the maximum amount of @xmath25  in the pocket the mixing process must produce a partial mixing layer of the right mass @xmath77 which eventually contains  enriched material . in the exponential overshooting model of @xcite",
    "the mixing coefficient is written as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mixing - length theory mixing coefficient at the base of the convection zone , @xmath80 is the geometric distance to the convective boundary , @xmath81 is the pressure scale height at the convective boundary , and @xmath82 is the overshooting parameter . if applied to core convection @xmath83 reproduces the observed width of the main sequence .",
    "@xcite finds that @xmath84 at the bottom of the convective envelope generates a large enough @xmath25   pocket .",
    "however , the maximum neutron exposure in the @xmath25  pocket of the overshooting model is @xmath85 , while in the non - overshooting models this value is @xmath86 .",
    "correspondingly @xcite obtained only negative values for the logarithmic ratio [ hs / ls ] , while the overshooting model with the larger neutron exposure predicts [ hs / ls]@xmath87 .",
    "this compares to an observed range of @xmath88}}}<0.0 $ ] for stars of solar metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a compilation of observational data ) .",
    "models with overshooting at all convective boundaries can reproduce only the largest observed hs / ls ratios , indicating that the neutron exposure in the @xmath25  pocket in these models is at the maximum of the observationally bounded range .",
    "overshooting alone is not able to account for all features of -mixing .",
    "in particular there is no mechanism to acount for the spread in neutron exposures within the overshooting framework .",
    "rotation , however , may induce a range of mixing efficiencies for a sample of stars with otherwise identical parameters .",
    "models of rotating agb stars were presented by @xcite , and the was analyzed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the implementation of rotation for the agb models was the same as the one that had been used previously to construct rotating models of massive stars @xcite .",
    "this implementation yields a @xmath25  pocket generated by shear mixing below the envelope convection base , however an order of magnitude smaller than what is needed in the partial mixing zone of a non - rotating model to reproduce the observed overproduction in stars .",
    "the second important finding is that shear mixing which initially generates the small @xmath25  pocket , prevails throughout the interpulse phase , even when the base of the convection is receding in mass after h - shell burning has resumed .",
    "when the dredge - up ends , the low - density slowly rotating convective envelope and the fast rotating compact radiative core are in contact and mixing is induced through shear at this location of large differential rotation .",
    "this radial velocity gradient remains as a source for shear mixing at exactly the mass coordinate of the @xmath25  pocket with important consequence for the .",
    "shear mixing during the interpulse phase swamps the @xmath25  pocket with @xmath9  from the pocket just above . by the time the temperature has reached about @xmath89 and @xmath25  starts to release neutrons via @xmath90 , @xmath9  is in fact more abundant than @xmath25  in all layers of the @xmath25  pocket .",
    "@xmath9  is a very efficient neutron poison .",
    "it has a very large @xmath91 rate and simply steels neutrons from the iron seed . as a result ,",
    "the neutron exposure is only @xmath92 , about a factor of ten too small to generate the observed  abundance distribution .",
    "the detailed post - processing models of current rotating agb stars showed that they are not capable to account for the observed overabundances .",
    "parametric models show that weaker shear mixing during the interpulse leads to a weaker poisoning effect .",
    "for very small poisoning effects the neutron exposures are still large enough to reproduce some observations .",
    "while neither rotation or overshooting alone provide the right amount of -mixing it is interesting to consider a combination of these .",
    "in essence the idea is that overshooting would provide mixing for the formation for the @xmath25  pocket and for a larger @xmath22abundance in the pdcz to obtain a large neutron exposure in the @xmath25pocket .",
    "then , shear mixing during the interpulse could add some poison and result in the observed spread .",
    "magnetic fields have not yet been considered in agb stellar evolution .",
    "however , one may assume that qualitatively magnetic fields will add coupling between the fast rotating core and the slowly rotating envelope and provide additional angular momentum transport .",
    "models including this effect could result in smaller shear mixing than predict by the current rotating agb stellar models .    it is interesting to note that such an effect of magnetic fields may also help to reconcile the predicted rotation rates of agb cores of @xmath93 with the rotation rate determinations of white dwarfs .",
    "spectroscopic determinations of rotation rates of white dwarfs of spectral type da can not rule out such values , but most are also consistent with zero or very low rotation @xcite . however , asterioseismological measurements of wd rotation rates clearly yield smaller values in the range @xmath94 ( see references in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high precision information on the pre - solar meteoritic sic grains provide isotope ratio measurements that allow to probe the conditions at the  nuclear production site in more detail .",
    "one example is the highly temperature dependent nucleosynthesis triggered by the release of neutrons from @xmath10  at the bottom of the pdcz .",

    "thus stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis connects nearby phenomena of planetary system formation with star formation and evolution in the earliest time of the universe as recorded in the element distribution patterns of the most metal - poor stars .    in the future",
    "the quantity and quality of spectroscopic data of stars , in particular the valuable most metal - poor stars , will increase dramatically , due to multi - object spectroscopy and large spectroscopic surveys .",
    "it is already becoming clear that this data can be put to full use only with qualitatively and quantitatively improved simulations of nuclear production in stars , including low and intermediate mass and massive stars .",

    "<S> _ the ejecta of the first probably very massive stars polluted the big bang primordial element mix with the first heavier elements . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ultra metal - poor abundance distribution provided the initial conditions for the second stars of a wide range of initial masses reaching down to intermediate and low masses . the importance of these second stars for understanding the origin of the elements in the early universe are manifold . while the massive first stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently observed . </S>",
    "<S> they are the carriers of the information about the first stars , but they are also capable of nuclear production themselves . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in order to use ultra or extremely metal - poor stars as a probe for the r - process in the early universe a reliable model of the s - process in the second stars is needed . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions ranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements , not only in the early but also in the present universe . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the c - rich extremely metal - poor stars , most of which show the signature , are thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase of intermediate mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> models of such agb stars at extremely low metallicity now exist , and comparison with observation show important discrepancies , for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen . </S>",
    "<S> this may hint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal - poor evolved stars that are not yet included in the standard picture of evolution , as for example the hydrogen - ingestion flash . </S>",
    "<S> the second stars of intermediate mass may have also played an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through slow neutron capture reaction chains ( s - process ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of models with observations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to be improved . </S>",
    "<S> the s - process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing the physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in stars , like for example rotation . as new observational techniques and strategies continue to penetrate the field , for example the multi - object spectroscopy , or the future spectroscopic surveys </S>",
