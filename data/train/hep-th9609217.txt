    "extended objects , known as ` branes ' , currently play an essential role in our understanding of the non - perturbative dynamics underlying ten - dimensional ( d=10 ) superstring theories and the 11-dimensional ( d=11 ) m - theory ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the context of the effective d=10 or d=11 supergravity theory",
    "a ` p - brane ' is a solution of the field equations representing a p - dimensional extended source for an abelian @xmath0-form gauge potential @xmath1 with @xmath2-form field strength @xmath3 . as such",
    ", the @xmath4-brane carries a charge @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hodge dual in the d - dimensional spacetime and the integral is over a @xmath7-sphere encircling the brane , as shown schematically in the figure below : 0.5 cm 0.5 cm in the case of a static infinite planar p - brane this formula is readily understood as a direct generalization of the @xmath8 case , i.e. a point particle in electrodynamics , with the @xmath9-dimensional ` transverse space ' ( spanned by vectors orthogonal to the @xmath0-dimensional worldvolume ) taking the place of space . in the case of a closed p - brane , static or otherwise , the charge @xmath10 can be understood ( after suitable normalization ) as the linking number of the p - brane with the @xmath7-sphere in the @xmath11-dimensional space .",
    "examples for @xmath12 are provided by the d=10 heterotic strings , for which @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the 3-form field strength for the 2-form gauge potential @xmath15 from the massless neveu - schwarz ( ns ) sector of the string spectrum .",
    "further d=10 examples are provided by the type ii superstrings , with the difference that @xmath15 is now the 2-form of origin in type ii superstring theory .",
    "a d=11 example is the charge @xmath16 carried by a supermembrane , where @xmath17 is the 4-form field strength for the 3-form potential @xmath18 of d=11 supergravity .",
    "the statement that a @xmath4-brane carries a charge of the above type can be rephrased as a statement about interaction terms in the effective worldvolume action governing the low - energy dynamics of the object .",
    "consider , for example , type ii and heterotic strings .",
    "let @xmath19 be the worldsheet coordinates and let @xmath20 describe the immersion of the worldsheet in the d=10 spacetime .",
    "then the worldsheet action in a background with a non - vanishing 2-form @xmath15 will include the term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the alternating tensor density on the worldsheet .",
    "thus the string is a source for @xmath15 and , since the coupling is ` minimal ' , it will contribute to the charge @xmath23 defined above .",
    "similarly , in a d=11 background with non - vanishing 3-form potential @xmath18 , the membrane action includes the term @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the immersion of the supermembrane s worldvolume in the d=11 spacetime , and @xmath26 are the worldvolume coordinates .",
    "this minimal interaction implies that the membrane is a source for @xmath18 with non - vanishing charge @xmath27 .",
    "the actions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are actually related by double - dimensional reduction , as are the full supermembrane and iia superstring actions @xcite .",
    "the dimensional reduction to d=10 involves setting @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coordinate of the compact 11th dimension , and taking all fields to be independent of @xmath31 . from the worldvolume perspective",
    "this amounts to a special choice of background for which @xmath32 is a killing vector field .",
    "double - dimensional reduction is then achieved by setting @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coordinate of a compact direction of the membrane , and then setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which is the ansatz appropriate to a membrane that wraps around the 11th dimension .",
    "the action @xmath28 then becomes @xmath29 after the identification @xmath37 , where @xmath38 indicates contraction with the vector field @xmath39 .    a coupling to @xmath15 of the form ( [ eq : introd ] ) is possible only for oriented strings .",
    "of the five d=10 superstring theories all are theories of oriented strings except the type i theory .",
    "thus , the type i string does _ not _ couple minimally to @xmath15 .",
    "instead , it couples _ non - minimally_. in the lorentz - covariant gs formalism in which the worldsheet fermions , @xmath40 , are in a spinor representation of the d=10 lorentz group , the worldsheet interaction lagrangian is @xmath41 because of the ` derivative ' coupling of the string to @xmath15 through its field strength @xmath14 , the @xmath23 charge carried by the type i string vanishes .",
    "as the above interaction shows , the type i string theory origin of @xmath15 is in the sector rather than the sector .",
    "this example illustrates a general feature of string theory : charges are _ not _ carried by the fundamental string . if there is anything that carries the charge @xmath23 in type i string theory it must be non - perturbative",
    "it is now known that there is such a non - perturbative object in type i string theory @xcite ; it is just the @xmath42 heterotic string !",
    "this is one of the key pieces of evidence in favour of the proposed ` duality ' , i.e. non - perturbative equivalence , of the type i and @xmath42 heterotic string theories .",
    "another is the fact that the two effective supergravity theories are equivalent , being related to each other by a field redefinition that takes @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dilaton @xcite .",
    "since the vacuum expectation value @xmath45 is the string coupling constant @xmath46 this means that the weak coupling limit of one theory is the strong coupling limit of the other .",
    "an important consequence of the charge @xmath10 carried by a @xmath4-brane is that it leads to a bps - type bound on the p - volume tension , @xmath47 of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is some constant characteristic of the particular supergravity theory , the choice of vacuum solution of this theory , and the value of @xmath4 . if one considers the class of static solutions with @xmath4-fold translational symmetry then a bound of the above form follows from the requirement that there be no naked singularities .",
    "this bound is saturated by the solution that is ` extreme ' in the sense of general relativity , i.e. for which the event horizon is a degenerate killing horizon . however , these considerations are clearly insufficient to show that the p - brane tension actually _ is _ bounded in this way because the physically relevant class of solutions is the much larger one for which only an appropriate _",
    "behaviour is imposed .",
    "remarkably , the attempt to establish a bps - type bound succeeds if and only if the theory is either a supergravity theory , or a consistent truncation of one @xcite . in particular",
    ", _ the presence of various chern - simons terms in the lagrangians of d=10 and d=11 supergravity theories is crucial to the existence of a bps - type bound on the tensions of the @xmath4-brane solutions of these theories_. this is so even when , as is usually the case , these chern - simons ( cs ) terms play no role in the @xmath4-brane solutions themselves in the sense that they are equally solutions of the ( non - supersymmetric ) truncated theory in which the cs terms are omitted .",
    "these facts hint at a more important role for the supergravity cs terms in determining the properties of @xmath4-branes than has hitherto been appreciated .",
    "this observation provided the principal motivation for this article , as will become clear .",
    "although the charge @xmath10 has only a magnitude , it is associated with an object whose spatial orientation is determined by a @xmath4-form of fixed magnitude .",
    "thus , a @xmath4-brane is naturally associated with a @xmath4-form charge of magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the supersymmetrization of terms of the form ( [ eq : introd ] ) or ( [ eq : introe ] ) leads to a type of super - wess - zumino term that implies a modification of the standard supersymmetry algebra to one of the ( schematic ) form @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an antisymmetrized product of @xmath4 dirac matrices and @xmath52 is a @xmath4-form charge whose magnitude is given by the coefficient of the wess - zumino term . for @xmath8",
    "this is the well - known modification that includes @xmath53 as a central charge .",
    "more generally , @xmath10 may be identified as the magnitude of @xmath52 , and an extension of the arguments used in the @xmath8 case @xcite shows that the supersymmetry algebra ( [ eq : extraone ] ) implies the bps - type bound on the p - brane tension @xmath47 .",
    "it also shows that the ` extreme ' @xmath4-brane solutions of supergravity theories which saturate the bound must preserve some of the supersymmetry , and the fraction preserved is always 1/2 for @xmath4-brane solutions in d=10 and d=11-branes in @xmath54 , but these can always be viewed as composites ( e.g. intersections ) of @xmath4-branes in d=10 or d=11 .",
    "we shall not need to consider such solutions here . ] .",
    "the heterotic and type ii superstrings and the d=11 supermembrane are examples not only of charged @xmath4-branes but also of _ extreme _ charged @xmath4-branes .",
    "this follows from the ` @xmath55-symmetry ' of their lorentz covariant and spacetime supersymmetric worldsheet / worldvolume actions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the bps - saturated @xmath4-branes are important in the context of the non - perturbative dynamics of superstring theories or m - theory for essentially the same reasons that bps - saturated solitons are important in d=4 field theories .",
    "in fact , most of the the latter can be understood as originating in d=10 or d=11 bps - saturated @xmath4-branes . for these reasons ,",
    "the bps - saturated p - branes are the ones of most interest and will be the only ones considered here .",
    "it should therefore be understood in what follows that by ` brane ' we mean ` bps - saturated brane ' .",
    "one of the lessons of recent years has been that much can be learned about the non - perturbative dynamics of superstring theories from the effective d=10 supergravity theories .",
    "one example of this is the fact that there exist p - brane solutions of type ii supergravity theories which are charged , in the sense explained above , with respect to the @xmath0-form gauge fields from the sector of the corresponding string theory . by supposing these branes to be present in the non - perturbative string theory one can understand how otherwise distinct superstring theories might be dual versions of the same underlying theory .",
    "the basic idea is that branes can ` improve ' string theory in the same way that strings ` improve ' kaluza - klein ( kk ) theory .",
    "for example , the @xmath56-compactified iia and iib supergravity theories have an identical massless d=9 spectrum but are different as kaluza - klein theories because their massive modes differ .",
    "the corresponding string theories are the same , however , because the inclusion of the string winding modes restores the equivalence of the massive spectra .",
    "similarly , the @xmath57-compactified type iia superstring theory and the @xmath58-compactified heterotic string theory have an identical massless d=6 spectrum , but since they differ in their perturbative massive spectra they are inequivalent as perturbative string theories .",
    "however , the non - perturbative massive spectrum of the iia superstring includes ` wrapping ' modes of 2-branes around 2-cycles of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these leads to the same massive bps spectrum in the two theories , and there is now strong evidence of a complete equivalence @xcite .",
    "this evidence rests , in part , on the fact that branes now have a remarkably simple description @xcite in string theory as d - branes , or d-@xmath4-branes if we wish to specify the value of @xmath4 ; the worldvolume of a d-@xmath4-brane is simply a ( p+1)-dimensional hyperplane defined by imposing @xmath9 dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundaries of open string worldsheets .    the distinctions between the various kinds of type ii p - brane , such as whether they are of or type , are not intrinsic but are rather artefacts ( albeit very useful ones ) of perturbation theory .",
    "non - perturbatively , all are on an equal footing since any one can be found from any other one by a combination of ` dualities ' .",
    "this feature is apparent in the iia or iib effective supergravity theories which treat all p - form gauge fields ` democratically ' .",
    "their string theory origin is nevertheless apparent from the supergravity solutions if the latter are expressed in terms of the _ string metric _ , instead of the canonical , or ` einstein ' , metric .",
    "one then finds that there are three categories of p - brane , ` fundamental ' ( f ) , ` dirichlet ' ( d ) and ` solitonic ' ( s ) according to the dependence of the p - volume tension on the string coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "specifically , @xmath60 note that according to this classification only strings can be ` fundamental ' .",
    "this is hardly surprising in view of the fact that we are discussing the dependence of the tension in terms of the string metric , but it seems to be a reflection of a more general observation @xcite that a sensible perturbation theory can be found only for particles or strings . similarly only 5-branes can be ` solitonic ' .",
    "this is a reflection of the electric / magnetic duality between strings and 5-branes in d=10 and the fact that the magnetic dual of a fundamental object is a solitonic one .",
    "it does not follow from this that all strings are fundamental and all 5-branes solitonic .",
    "this is nicely illustrated by the string solution of n=1 supergravity representing the heterotic string .",
    "this solution is ` fundamental ' as a solution of the effective supergravity theory of the heterotic string , as it must be of course , but it is a d - string when viewed as a solution of the effective supergravity theory of the type i string .",
    "thus , a single supergravity solution can have two quite different string theory interpretations .",
    "the m - theory branes , or ` m - branes ' , consist of only the d=11 membrane and its magnetic dual , a fivebrane .",
    "we saw earlier that the classical iia superstring action is related to that of the d=11 supermembrane by double - dimensional reduction .",
    "this was widely considered to be merely a ` coincidence ' , somewhat analogous to the fact that iia supergravity happens to be the dimensional reduction of d=11 supergravity ; after all , the _ quantum _ superstring theory has d=10 as its critical dimension .",
    "however , the critical dimension emerges from a calculation in _ perturbative _ string theory .",
    "it is still possible that the non - perturbative theory really is 11-dimensional , but if this is so the kk spectrum of the @xmath56-compactified d=11 supergravity must appear in the non - perturbative iia superstring spectrum .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the extreme black holes of iia supergravity , now regarded as the effective field theory realization of d-0-branes , are candidates for this non - perturbative kk spectrum .",
    "this means that the iia superstring really _ is _ an @xmath56-wrapped d=11 supermembrane , but it does not then follow that the supermembrane is also ` fundamental ' because this adjective is meaningful only in the context of a specific perturbation theory .",
    "for example , the @xmath42 heterotic string is ` fundamental ' at weak coupling but as the coupling increases it transmutes into the d - string of the type i theory .",
    "another example is the iib string which is ` fundamental ' at weak coupling but which transmutes into the d - string of a dual iib theory at strong coupling @xcite . in the iia case",
    "the strong coupling limit is a decompactification limit in which the d=11 lorentz invariance is restored and the effective d=10 iia supergravity is replaced by d=11 supergravity @xcite .",
    "the ` fundamental ' iia superstring transmutes , in this limit , into the unwrapped d=11 membrane of m - theory but , because of the absence of a dilaton , there is no analogue of string perturbation theory in d=11 and so there is no analogous basis for deciding whether or not the membrane is ` fundamental ' .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall shortly see , there is an intrinsic asymmetry between m - theory membranes and fivebranes which suggests a fundamental role for the membrane in some as yet unknown sense .",
    "given that the heterotic string appears as a d - brane in type i string theory one might wonder whether the type i string should make an appearance somewhere in the non - perturbative so(32 ) heterotic string theory . as we have seen , however , the type i string carries no @xmath23 charge , so its description in the effective supergravity theory would have to be as a non - extreme , or ` black ' , string .",
    "infinite uncharged black strings have been shown to be unstable against perturbations that have the tendency to break the string into small segments @xcite ( whereas extreme strings are stable because they saturate a bps - type bound ) .",
    "this is exactly what one expects from string theory since a closed type i string can break , i.e. type i string theory is a theory of both closed and open strings .",
    "the reason that this is possible for type i strings , but not for heterotic or type ii strings , is precisely that the type i string carries no @xmath23 charge . to see this ,",
    "suppose that a string carrying a non - zero @xmath23 charge were to have an endpoint .",
    "one could then ` slide off ' the 7-sphere encircling the string and contract it to a point .",
    "provided that the integral defining @xmath23 is homotopy invariant , which it will be if @xmath61 , the charge @xmath23 must then vanish , in contradiction to the initial assumption .",
    "we conclude that the only breakable strings are those for which @xmath62 .",
    "thus type ii and heterotic strings can not break . clearly , similar arguments applied to @xmath4-branes carrying non - zero @xmath10 charge lead to the conclusion that they too can not break .    by ` break ' we mean to imply that the @xmath63-brane boundary created in this process is ` free ' in the sense that its dynamics is determined entirely by the @xmath4-brane of which it is the boundary .",
    "an ` unbreakable ' p - brane may nevertheless be open if its boundary is tethered to some other object because there may then be an obstruction to sliding the @xmath7-sphere off the end of the p - brane .",
    "examples of such obstructions are the d - branes on which type ii superstrings can end .",
    "one way to understand how this is consistent with conservation of the charge @xmath23 is to consider the d - brane s effective worldvolume action , which governs its low - energy dynamics .",
    "the field content of this action is found from the massless sector of an open type ii superstring with mixed neumann / dirichlet boundary conditions at the ends .",
    "these fields are essentially the same as those of the open type i string without chan - paton factors with the difference that they depend only on the d - brane s worldvolume coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , these worldvolume fields include an abelian 1-form potential @xmath64 .",
    "the bosonic sector of the effective worldvolume action , in a general background , can be deduced from the requirement of conformal invariance of the type ii string action for a worldsheet with a boundary @xcite .",
    "this effective worldvolume action is found to contain the term @xmath65 where the integral is over the @xmath0-dimensional worldvolume @xmath66 and it is to be understood that the spacetime 2-form @xmath15 is pulled back to @xmath66 .",
    "this shows that the d - brane is a source of @xmath15 .",
    "if we modify the equation @xmath61 in order to include this source we find , by integration , that @xmath67 where @xmath23 is defined as before in ( [ eq : introa ] ) . the integral on the right hand side of ( [ eq : introi ] ) is over a @xmath68-sphere in the d - brane surrounding the string s endpoint and @xmath69 is the _ worldvolume _ hodge dual .",
    "this result can be interpreted as the statement that the charge of the string can be ` transferred ' to an electric charge of a particle on the d - brane , so charge conservation is compatible with the existence of an open string provided that its endpoints are identified with charged particles living on a d - brane .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the d=11 membrane which , we recall , is an electric - type source for the 3-form gauge potential @xmath18 of d=11 supergravity . in this case , the d=11 fivebrane has a worldvolume action containing the terms @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the 3-form field strength for a worldvolume 2-form potential @xmath72 , and it is again to be understood that @xmath18 is the pullback of the spacetime field to the worldvolume . actually , the worldvolume 3-form @xmath73 is _ self - dual _ , but this condition must be imposed after variation of the action ( [ eq : introj ] ) .",
    "the second term in this action is needed for consistency of the self - duality condition with the @xmath72 field equation . apart from this subtlety ,",
    "we see from its worldvolume action that the fivebrane is a source for @xmath18 .",
    "its inclusion in the field equation for @xmath18 leads , after integration , to the equation @xmath74 which can be interpreted as the statement that the membrane charge can be transferred to a charge carried by a self - dual string within the fivebrane .",
    "this string is just the boundary of an open membrane .",
    "thus , the d=11 fivebrane is the m - theory equivalent of a d - brane @xcite .",
    "the above analysis can be generalized @xcite to determine whether a @xmath4-brane can end on a @xmath75-brane , as follows .",
    "one first determines the worldvolume field content of the @xmath75-brane . if this includes a @xmath4-form gauge field @xmath76 , and if the spacetime fields include a @xmath0-form gauge potential @xmath1 , then one can postulate a coupling of the form @xmath77 in the @xmath75-brane s effective worldvolume action .",
    "this leads to the @xmath75-brane appearing as a source for @xmath1 such that @xmath78 where the integral in the @xmath75-brane is over a @xmath79-sphere surrounding the @xmath63-brane boundary of the p - brane .",
    "thus , the @xmath4-brane charge can be transferred to the electric charge of the @xmath63-brane boundary living in the @xmath75-brane .",
    "that is , charge conservation now permits the @xmath4-brane to be open provided its boundary lies in a @xmath75-brane .",
    "the cases discussed above clearly fit this pattern , but there are drawbacks to this approach .",
    "firstly , it is indirect because one must first determine the worldvolume field content of all relevant branes .",
    "secondly , it is _ ad hoc _ because , in general , the worldvolume coupling is postulated rather than derived .",
    "the subtleties alluded to above in the construction of the fivebrane action show that this is not a trivial matter .",
    "in fact , even the bosonic fivebrane action is not yet fully known and until it is one can not be completely certain that the wanted terms in this action really are present .    in this contribution",
    "i will present a new , and extremely simple , method for the determination of when @xmath4-branes may have boundaries on @xmath75-branes .",
    "essentially , _ one can read off from the chern - simons terms in the supergravity action whether any given @xmath4-brane can have a boundary and , if so , in what @xmath75-brane the boundary must lie_. as such , the method provides a further example of how much can be learned about the non - perturbative dynamics of superstring theories , or m - theory , from nothing more than the effective supergravity theory .",
    "i have called the method ` brane surgery ' because of a notional similarity to the way in which manifolds can be ` glued ' together by the mathematical procedure known as ` surgery ' , but it is not intended that the term should be understood here in its technical sense .",
    "it is pleasure to dedicate this contribution to the memory of claude itzykson , who would surely have apreciated the remarkable confluence of ideas that has marked recent advances in the theory that is still , misleadingly , called ` string theory ' .",
    "i shall explain the ` brane surgery ' method initially in the context of the iib theory .",
    "both iia and iib supergravity have in common the bosonic fields ( @xmath80 ) from the sector , all of which have already made an appearance above .",
    "the remaining bosonic fields come from the sector .",
    "the ( massless ) fields of the iib theory are @xmath81 i.e. a pseudoscalar @xmath82 , another 2-form gauge potential @xmath83 and a 4-form gauge potential @xmath84 with a _ self - dual _ 5-form field strength @xmath85 .",
    "the self - duality condition makes the construction of an action problematic but , as with the self - duality condition on the d=11 fivebrane s worldvolume field strength @xmath73 , one can choose to impose this condition _ after _ varying the action . when the iib action is understood in this way it contains the cs term @xmath86 where @xmath87 , as before , and @xmath88 .",
    "this cs term modifies the @xmath15 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 field equations .",
    "consider first the @xmath15 equation .",
    "this becomes @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the self - dual 5-form field strength for @xmath84 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath91 since @xmath92 is no longer a closed form its integral over a 7-sphere will no longer be homotopy invariant .",
    "clearly , the well - defined , homotopy invariant , charge associated with the fundamental iib string is _ not _ @xmath23 as defined in ( [ eq : introa ] ) but rather @xmath93\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : onee}\\ ] ] let us again suppose that the iib string has an endpoint . far away from this endpoint",
    "we can ignore all fields other than @xmath14 , to a good approximation , so that @xmath94 .",
    "how good this aproximation is actually depends on the ratio of the radius @xmath95 of the 7-sphere to the its distance @xmath96 from the end of the string , and it can be made arbitrarily good by increasing @xmath96 for fixed @xmath95 .",
    "this shows , in particular , that @xmath97 for the fundamental iib string .",
    "let us now ` slide ' the 7-sphere along the string towards the endpoint .",
    "if the @xmath98 term could be entirely ignored we would be back in the situation described previously in which we arrived at a contradiction , so we are forced to suppose that an endpoint is associated with a non - vanishing value of @xmath99 .",
    "nevertheless , the approximate equality of @xmath100 to @xmath23 , which ignores the @xmath99 term , can be maintained , to the same precision , if the 7-sphere surrounding the string is contracted as we approach the endpoint so as to keep the ratio @xmath101 constant .",
    "then , as @xmath102 so also @xmath103 , until at @xmath104 the 7-sphere is contracted to the endpoint itself .",
    "we can then deform the 7-sphere into the product @xmath105 so that @xmath100 now receives its entire contribution from the @xmath99 term as follows : @xmath106 the @xmath105 integration region is illustrated schematically by the figure below : 0.5 cm 0.5 cm observe that the @xmath107 integral is just the definition of the charge @xmath108 carried by a 3-brane , so the iib string has its endpoint on a 3-brane ; the @xmath109 integration surface lies within the 3-brane and surrounds the string endpoint . let us choose @xmath110 . if we further suppose that @xmath111 within the 3-brane , which is reasonable in the absence of any d - string source for this field , then @xmath83 is a closed 2-form which we may write , locally , as @xmath112 for some 1-form @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114 effectively , @xmath113 is a field living on the worldvolume of the 3-brane .",
    "clearly , it can not be globally defined because the right hand side of ( [ eq : onefa ] ) is a magnetic charge on the 3-brane associated with the vector potential @xmath113 .",
    "now consider the @xmath83 equation .",
    "taking the cs term ( [ eq : oneb ] ) into account we have @xmath115 by the same reasoning as before we deduce that the d - string can end on a 3-brane .",
    "charge conservation is satisfied because the d - string charge can be expressed as @xmath116 since there is no fundamental string source in the problem we may suppose that @xmath117 , so that now @xmath15 is a closed 2-form which we may write , locally , as @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath110 we now have @xmath119 so the d - string charge has been transferred to a magnetic charge of the 1-form potential @xmath64 on the 3-brane s worldvolume .",
    "it must be regarded as a weakness of the above analysis that it does not supply the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath113 , although we know that there must be one because both supersymmetry and an analysis of the small fluctuations about the 3-brane solution show that there is only _ one _ worldvolume 1-form potential .",
    "in fact , @xmath64 and @xmath113 are dual in the sense that @xmath120 where we recall that @xmath69 indicates the _ worldvolume _ hodge dual . using this relation , ( [ eq : oneg ] )",
    "becomes @xmath121 i.e. the endpoint of the iib string on the 3-brane is an _ electric _ charge associated with @xmath64 .",
    "we thereby recover the d - brane picture for the iib 3-brane ; the fact that the d - string can end on the magnetic charge associated with @xmath64 is then a consequence of the strong / weak coupling duality in iib superstring theory interchanging the fundamental string with the d - string .",
    "it will be seen from the examples to follow that the need to impose a condition of the type ( [ eq : onega ] ) is a general feature , which is not explained by the ` brane surgery ' method .",
    "however , the method does determine whether a given p - brane can have a boundary and , if so , the possible q - branes in which the boundary must lie .    as a further illustration",
    "we now observe that whereas ( [ eq : onec ] ) was previously rewritten as ( [ eq : oned ] ) , we could instead rewrite it as @xmath122 thus an equivalent definition of @xmath100 is @xmath123\\ .",

    "we conclude that @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a locally - defined 3-form field on the 5-brane worldvolume , which can be traded for a 1-form potential @xmath64 via the relation @xmath132 we conclude that the cs term allows the fundamental iib string to end on a 5-brane as well as on a 3-brane , and that the end of the string is electrically charged with respect to a 1-form potential @xmath64 living on the 5-brane s worldvolume .",
    "this is just the usual picture of the d-5-brane .",
    "interchanging the roles of @xmath15 and @xmath83 leads to the further possibility of the d - string ending on the solitonic 5-brane .",
    "we have not yet exhausted the implications of the cs term ( [ eq : oneb ] ) because we have still to consider how it affects the @xmath84 equation of motion .",
    "we find that , from the ` modified ' bianchi identity for @xmath85 . ]",

    "can be slid towards , and contracted onto , the boundary , after which it emerges as the product @xmath136 . setting @xmath118 again we arrive at the expression @xmath137 for the 3-brane charge .",
    "the singularity involved in this deformation of the 7-sphere is now the 2-brane boundary of the 3-brane within a d-5-brane , since we recognise the first integral on the right hand side of ( [ eq : onel ] ) as @xmath127 .",
    "setting @xmath128 we learn that the 3-brane charge can be transferred to a magnetic charge of a d-5-brane worldvolume 1-form potential @xmath64 , defined by a 2-sphere in the d-5-brane surrounding the 2-brane boundary .",
    "the main point in all this is that a 3-brane can have a boundary in a d-5-brane , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this possibility follows by t - duality from the previous results : the configuration of a d - string ending on a d-3-brane is mapped to a d-3-brane ending on a d-5-brane by t - duality in two directions orthogonal to both the d - string and the d-3-brane . by interchanging the roles of @xmath15 and @xmath83 in the above analysis one sees that a 3-brane can also end on a solitonic 5-brane .",
    "we have seen that the cs term ( [ eq : oneb ] ) allows a iib string to end on a d-3-brane or a d-5-brane , but we know from string theory that it can also end on a d - string or a d-7-brane .",
    "as we shall see shortly , these possibilities are consequences of the fact that the kinetic term for @xmath138 actually has the form @xmath139 there is no obvious relation to cs terms yet , but if we perform a duality transformation to replace the 2-form @xmath83 by its 6-form dual @xmath140 with 7-form field strength @xmath141 , so that _ on shell _ @xmath142 then one finds that the dualized action contains the cs term @xmath143 clearly , this modifies the @xmath15 equation so that , following the steps explained previously , we end up with an expression @xmath144 the first integral can be identified , using ( [ eq : onema ] ) , as the d - string charge .",
    "the final ` integral ' over @xmath145 is just the difference between the value of @xmath82 on either side of the string boundary on the d - string ; by the same logic as before we may assume that @xmath146 , _ locally _ , but allow the constant @xmath82 to be different on either side .",
    "thus , the charge @xmath23 on the fundamental iib string is transformed into the topological charge of a type of ` kink ' on the d - string .",
    "alternatively , we can deform @xmath124 to @xmath147 , so that @xmath148 the first integral is the charge @xmath149 associated with the d-7-brane .",
    "this charge can be non - zero because of the periodic identification of @xmath82 implied by the conjectured @xmath150 invariance of iib superstring theory @xcite . for @xmath151 , and setting @xmath152 for 5-form potential @xmath153 ( since we may assume that @xmath154 ) , we have @xmath155 defining the 1-form @xmath64 on the 7-brane s worldvolume by @xmath156 we can rewrite ( [ eq : oneq ] ) as @xmath157 we conclude that the iib string may end on an electric charge in a 7-brane .",
    "this is just the description of the d-7-brane .",
    "the ` brane surgery ' method should now be clear .",
    "we shall now apply it to iia supergravity , for which the gauge potentials are @xmath158 i.e. a 1-form @xmath159 and a 3-form @xmath18 .",
    "we might start by considering the cs term @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the 4-form field strength of @xmath18 .",
    "consideration of this term leads to the conclusion that ( i ) a iia string can end on a 4-brane , and ( ii ) a 2-brane can end on either a 4-brane or a 5-brane . since the cs term ( [ eq : twob ] ) is so obviously related to the similar one in d=11 to be considered below we shall pass over the details . the fact that the iia string can also end on either a 2-brane or a 6-brane follows from the fact that the field strength @xmath161 has a ` modified ' bianchi identity @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the field strength of @xmath159 ( this has a kaluza - klein origin in d=11 ) .",
    "we can dualize @xmath18 to convert this modified bianchi into a cs term of the form @xmath164 where the 6-form @xmath165 is , on - shell , the hodge dual of @xmath161 .",
    "this modifies the @xmath15 equation to @xmath166 we may therefore take the modified charge @xmath100 to be @xmath167\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : twof}\\ ] ] now , by the identical reasoning used in the iib case , we first deform the 7-sphere so as to arrive at the formula @xmath168 we then identify the first integral as the charge @xmath27 of a membrane .",
    "we then set @xmath169 and @xmath170 for some scalar @xmath31 defined locally on the worldvolume of the membrane to conclude that the iia string can end on a membrane , with the string s charge now being transferred to the magnetic - type charge @xmath171 of a particle on the membrane @xcite .",
    "this charge can be non - zero if @xmath31 is periodically identified .",
    "clearly , from the kk origin of @xmath159 , we should interpret @xmath31 as the coordinate of a hidden 11th dimension .",
    "defining the worldvolume 1-form @xmath64 by @xmath172 we recover @xcite the usual description of the iia d-2-brane , in which the end of the string on the membrane carries the electric charge @xmath173    returning to ( [ eq : twoe ] ) we can alternatively define the modified string charge to be @xmath174\\ , \\label{eq : twok}\\ ] ] where @xmath175 is the 5-form potential associated with @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath176 . since @xmath177 is the 6-brane charge , similar reasoning to that above , but now setting @xmath178 , leads to the conclusion that a iia string can also end on a 6-brane and that the string charge is transferred to the 6-brane magnetic charge @xmath179 which can be rewritten in the expected electric charge form @xmath180 by introducing the worldvolume 1-form potential @xmath64 dual to @xmath181 .    the remaining iia d - branes are the 0-brane and the 8-brane .",
    "the possibility of a iia string ending on a 0-brane is _ not _ found by the ` brane surgery ' method for the good reason that it is actually forbidden by charge conservation unless the 0-brane is the endpoint of two or more strings .",
    "thus , a modification of the method will be needed to deal with this case .",
    "neither is it it clear how the method can cope with the iia 8-brane , because of the non - generic peculiarities of this case .    leaving aside these limitations of the method , there are further consequences to be deduced from the cs term ( [ eq : twod ] ) .",
    "we have still to consider its effect on the @xmath175 equation of motion .",
    "actually it is easier to return to the modified bianchi identity ( [ eq : twoc ] ) , which we can rewrite as @xmath182 this shows that the homotopy - invariant magnetic 4-brane charge is actually @xmath183\\ .",

    "the second integral is the magnetic charge associated with a 3-brane within the 6-brane .",
    "the 3-brane is of course the 4-brane s boundary .",
    "thus a 4-brane can end on a 6-brane .",
    "this is not unexpected because it follows by t - duality from the fact that a iib 3-brane can end on a d-5-brane .",
    "we could as well have rewritten the modified bianchi identity ( [ eq : twoc ] ) as @xmath186 in which case a similar line of reasoning , but setting @xmath187 , and so @xmath170 , leads to the expression @xmath188 the first integral is the magnetic 5-brane charge @xmath189 , so we deduce that a 4-brane can also end on a ( solitonic ) 5-brane .",
    "the 3-brane boundary in the 5-brane is a magnetic source for the scalar field @xmath31 .",
    "the kk origin of @xmath31 suggests a d=11 interpretation of this possibility .",
    "it is surely closely related to the fact that two d=11 fivebranes can intersect on a 3-brane @xcite , since by wrapping one of the 5-branes ( but not the other one ) around the 11th dimension we arrive at a d-4-brane intersecting a solitonic 5-brane in a 3-brane .",
    "this is not quite the same as a d-4-brane _ ending _ on a 5-brane , but the intersection could be viewed as two 4-branes which happen to end on a common 3-brane boundary in the 5-brane .",
    "this illustrates a close connection between the ` brane boundary ' rules and the ` brane intersection rules ' , which will not be discussed here .",
    "finally , we turn to m - theory , or rather d=11 supergravity and its p - brane solutions . the bosonic fields of d=11 supergravity are the 11-metric and a 3-form gauge potential @xmath18 with 4-form field strength @xmath17 .",
    "the bianchi identity for @xmath161 is @xmath190 from which we may immediately conclude that the d=11 fivebrane must be closed .",
    "the same is not true of the d=11 membrane , however , because there is a cs term in the action of the form @xmath191 which leads to the following field equation term .",
    "we note that since the 5-brane is actually a completely non - singular solution of the d=11 field equations @xcite it should not be necessary to include it as a source . ]",

    "set @xmath197 .",
    "we may also set to zero the components of @xmath161 ` parallel ' to the fivebrane , so that @xmath198 in the second integral . we then have @xmath199 which is the magnetic charge of the string boundary of the membrane in the fivebrane .    in fact , the 3-form field - strength @xmath200 ( or rather @xmath201 in a general background ) is _ self - dual _ but we do not learn this fact from the ` brane surgery ' method . as for the iib 3-brane , where we saw that the worldvolume 1-forms @xmath64 and @xmath202 are related by hodge duality of their 2-form field strengths ,",
    "this information must be gleaned from a different analysis .",
    "the similarity between these constraints on the worldvolume gauge fields suggests that a deeper understanding of the phenomenon should be possible .    in this contribution",
    "i have discussed the rules governing ` brane boundaries ' in superstring and m - theory and shown that they follow from consideration of interactions in the corresponding effective supergravity theories .",
    "it should be appreciated that brane boundaries constitute a subset of possible ` brane interactions ' , which include intersecting branes and branes of varying topologies .",
    "a reasonably complete picture is now emerging of the static aspects of brane interactions , but little is known at present about the dynamic aspects , i.e. the analogue of the splitting and joining interaction in string theory .",
