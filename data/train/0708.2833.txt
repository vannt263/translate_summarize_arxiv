    "the standard leading twist formalism for calculating deeply inelastic lepton - proton scattering ( dis ) cross sections provides a foundation for understanding parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) in general . at issue in the present paper",
    "are the various approximations to parton kinematics that are fundamental to the standard approach , as we will review in sec .",
    "[ sec : breakdown ] .",
    "these approximations are appropriate for very inclusive cross sections , and they result in a number of appealing conceptual and practical simplifications .",
    "the resulting factorization theorems involve standard ( fully integrated ) pdfs that have rigorous definitions and depend only on the longitudinal component of the parton momentum  @xcite .",
    "but when the true final states are studied in more detail , problems arise .",
    "although various resummation methods are used to overcome the problems , it has become increasingly clear @xcite that it is the standard kinematic approximations that should be questioned .",
    "the problems arise because the approximations change momenta of particles in the final state , typically resulting in a final state that does not obey 4-momentum conservation . for a fully inclusive cross section ,",
    "this is not a critical issue .",
    "furthermore , if one is only concerned with obtaining a leading - logarithm approximation ( improved only by the use of an appropriate running coupling ) , it is legitimate to be imprecise about the details of the kinematic approximations .    but to be able to make systematic improvements by including higher order corrections to the hard scattering , and to the showering and evolution kernels , etc , a precise formulation of the approximations is needed .",
    "of course , one must expect approximations to be needed if one is to obtain tractable factorization results .",
    "but for the formalism to be generally applicable , it is necessary to define the approximations in such a way that final - state momenta are unaltered .",
    "attempts to remedy the situation are now stymied by the use of conventional `` integrated parton densities '' ; there is a mismatch @xcite between the definitions of integrated parton densities and the imperatives of factorization with correct final - state kinematics .",
    "the mismatch extends equally to fragmentation functions .",
    "as explained in @xcite , when we use methods that treat final - state kinematics exactly , we are led to the replacement of conventional parton densities by more general quantities .",
    "the range of methods , from standard ones with approximated final - state kinematics to the improved ones that are the subject of this paper , can be characterized by the kind of parton densities , or generalization , that are used :    * * conventional integrated parton densities : * these are the usual pdfs ; they depend only on a longitudinal momentum fraction variable , @xmath0 , and the hard scale , @xmath1 .",
    "all other components of parton momentum are integrated over .",
    "correspondingly , the intrinsic external parton transverse momentum @xmath2 and virtuality are neglected in the hard scattering .",
    "these parton densities have consistent operator definitions @xcite used in the classic proofs of factorization . *",
    "* unintegrated parton densities : * these are the @xmath2-dependent pdfs obtained when the integral over parton transverse momentum is left undone , while the minus component ( or virtuality ) is still integrated over .",
    "the concept of an unintegrated parton density appeared quite early @xcite , necessary for the treatment of the transverse momentum distribution in the drell - yan process .",
    "these quantities are also called transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton densities .",
    "there are also tmd fragmentation functions .",
    "+ unintegrated parton distribution functions also appear naturally in the high energy limit of qcd @xcite where one of the key features is the lack of the transverse momentum ordering of subsequent gluon emissions .",
    "small-@xmath0 resummation then provides an evolution equation in a rapidity variable for this unintegrated gluon distribution function . in this approach the integrated gluon density",
    "is defined simply as an integral over the transverse momentum up to a hard scale .",
    "however , the definitions of tmd densities that we refer to in this work may not , in general , agree with other definitions appearing in the literature .",
    "+ as for a definition , the obvious and natural one is given by the hadron expectation value of the parton number operator in light - front quantization , equivalent to a standard simple expression as an expectation value of a bilocal field operator , in light - front gauge .",
    "however , this definition suffers @xcite from what we will call rapidity divergences , from where the rapidity of internal gluons goes to infinity .",
    "these divergences occur even when ultraviolet and infra - red divergences are cut off , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "+ so a correct definition requires an explicit cutoff for the rapidity divergences .",
    "collins and soper @xcite used a non - light - like axial gauge for this purpose .",
    "certain improvements are probably necessary , as we will see .",
    "other work suffers from an imprecision in the definitions .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we do not see the operator definitions at all , and the issues concerning rapidity divergences are completely hidden , probably in some application of a leading logarithm approximation , with cutoffs on both real and virtual lines in feynman graphs . however , it is important to understand the differences in the definitions of tmds within different theoretical treatments .",
    "for example , in a recent analysis of dijet correlations at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite , it is shown that there is a large variation between the predictions obtained using different tmds from the literature .",
    "therefore it is necessary to construct a precise and unique operator definition of the unintegrated parton distribution functions .",
    "then , hopefully , the different cases discussed above ( for example those which emerge in the context of bfkl @xcite or angular ordered @xcite evolutions ) will follow naturally as particular limits of the general definition , or as changes of factorization scheme .",
    "+ for the concept of a parton density to be applicable in the real world of hadron physics , it needs to include all the relevant non - perturbative phenomena concerning the actual state of the parent hadron .",
    "in particular , the need for tmd densities arises when we treat final states in enough detail to be sensitive to the transverse momenta of partons relative to their parent hadrons , etc .",
    "more recent work devoted to providing precise definitions to the tmd densities was done in ref .",
    "* parton correlation functions : * an even closer examination of final - state kinematics , as was done for small-@xmath0 physics by watt , martin , and ryskin @xcite , indicates that `` doubly unintegrated '' pdfs ( differential in all components of parton momentum ) are more appropriate in many situations .",
    "these can also be called `` fully unintegrated parton densities '' , but in this paper we will simply call them `` parton correlation functions '' ( pcfs ) . collins and jung @xcite showed very generally that for differential distributions in final - states the use of parton correlation functions is necessary .",
    "collins and zu @xcite set up a complete formalism in a model field theory , suitable for monte - carlo event generator implementation , with the possibility of incorporating arbitrarily non - leading - order corrections .",
    "+ under the label of parton correlation function we will include both the fully unintegrated generalization of parton densities , and related objects for fragmentation , and for soft factors in factorization theorems .",
    "the need in the general case for making no approximations on final - state kinematics impels us to a formalism that uses pcfs .",
    "unfortunately , a complete treatment and derivation of factorization using pcfs does not yet exist for qcd .",
    "therefore , our aim in this paper is to initiate the construction of such a formalism .",
    "the new formalism should handle non - leading - order corrections as generally as the standard formalism .",
    "thus it will be as good , if not better , in cases where more traditional approaches are applicable .",
    "but it will also apply to more general situations .    to treat kinematics correctly , we need to go back to the foundations , and we will see that the basic structure of the derivation in fact needs to be significantly modified _ even at the lowest - order , parton - model level _ for dis . normally , one starts with the handbag diagram of fig .",
    "[ lodiags](a ) , where the outgoing struck quark is exactly massless and on - shell .",
    "but even without any sophisticated treatment of qcd effects , we know that the quark must turn into a jet .",
    "so a minimum logical foundation starts from fig .",
    "[ lodiags](b ) , where the outgoing quark line now has acquired a jet subgraph . in fact , examining the kinematics of such graphs gives the motivation @xcite for searching for methods that use pcfs .",
    "c@c   &   + ( a ) & ( b ) +   +    however , in real qcd , this is not sufficient .",
    "there must certainly be non - perturbative interactions at late times to neutralize the color of the outgoing quark .",
    "furthermore , even in perturbation theory , and even _ without going to the conventional domain for nlo corrections where extra high transverse momentum jets are produced _ , it is necessary to consider all regions of the form symbolized by the graphs of fig .",
    "[ lodiags](c ) .",
    "there are arbitrarily many collinear gluons exchanged between the jet and spectator subgraphs and the hard scattering , and there are arbitrarily many soft ( interacting ) gluons connecting the jet and spectator subgraphs .",
    "we do not have topological factorization @xcite of the subgraphs .",
    "only after an application of ward identities to give a coherent sum over different graphs does one obtain factorization for the cross section .",
    "a consequence is that , to obtain a correct factorization formula , one needs to make a careful selection of an appropriate gauge - invariant definition of the parton correlation functions .",
    "so the key issues center around what such a definition is and why .",
    "these issues are in fact present in conventional factorization , although most treatments do not emphasize them . the reasons why we now need to examine them in much closer and exact detail",
    "are coupled to our current aims of treating final states less inclusively .",
    "the ward identities used to derive factorization apply only after the application of certain approximations . in the most obvious way of setting them up , the approximations are only valid in regions of appropriately strongly ordered kinematics .",
    "moreover , there is a general tendency in constructing derivations to neglect power - suppressed corrections whenever it assists the ease of derivation .",
    "the ward identity arguments are therefore typically applied to amplitudes where cutoffs are imposed on the momenta of internal lines of the graphs .",
    "but the ward identities are only exact when applied to amplitudes in the exact theory , i.e. , when no cutoffs whatever are applied to the internal momenta other than , possibly , a conventional gauge invariant cutoff for uv divergences .",
    "there is therefore a conflict between the cutoffs used in discussing why factorization occurs and the lack of cutoffs needed for the validity of the ward identities . once we go beyond the leading logarithm approximation we can not restrict the kinematics to strongly ordered regions .",
    "a careful and precise formulation of approximations and ward identities is needed , otherwise there are likely to be present uncontrolled correction terms that can readily violate factorization .",
    "a subtraction formalism , such as we will use , avoids the problems with direct cutoffs on the momenta of lines of feynman graphs .",
    "examination of the literature  e.g. , @xcite  shows that the ward identities for proving factorization are typically stated and proved too inexplicitly for our purposes .",
    "we stress that the treatment in this paper is limited to lowest order in the hard scattering , where the final states are rather simple .",
    "what we discuss in this paper may be thought of as a formal generalization of the parton model to cases where the details of over - all kinematics are important .",
    "this is a critical step toward a complete formalism because higher order calculations rely on the subtraction formalism to avoid double counting the zeroth order contribution .",
    "knowing exactly what is subtracted requires a complete understanding of the zeroth order contribution .",
    "if it turned out that factorization were universally true , these issues would not be pressing .",
    "however , recent work indicates otherwise .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite , rather unambiguously @xcite that factorization fails for production of hadrons of high transverse momentum in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this is in the case that the hadrons are close to back - to - back azimuthally , when unintegrated parton densities are an appropriate tool .",
    "see also the recent paper by bauer and tackmann @xcite for a closely related argument .",
    "in other situations , model calculations can appear to show that factorization fails , but the culprit is an inappropriate definition of parton densities .",
    "an example is the transverse single - spin - asymmetry ( ssa ) in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , which brodsky , hwang and schmidt @xcite found to be non - factorizing .",
    "collins @xcite showed that factorization does actually hold , but only if suitable wilson line operators are used in the definition of the unintegrated parton densities .",
    "these motivations lead us to the detailed treatment in the present paper .",
    "the issue that makes the work of collins and zu @xcite insufficient is the presence of extra gluonic connections between the subgraphs of fig .",
    "[ lodiags](c ) .",
    "further difficulties are associated with the masslessness of the gluon in qcd , and with the complicated nature of ward identities in a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "it is useful to solve the difficulties one - by - one .",
    "so the full technical results in this paper are restricted to the case of an abelian gauge theory with a massive gluon .",
    "however , much of our treatment applies more generally and includes qcd .",
    "furthermore we will obtain a factorization stated in terms of pcfs with precise definitions as certain operator matrix elements .",
    "the statement of factorization is equally applicable to qcd .    in sec .",

    "the parton - model region is where the transverse and minus components of @xmath18 are small relative to @xmath19 , and where @xmath18 and @xmath29 both have small virtualities relative to @xmath30 .",

    "the integrand in ( [ eq : f2parmodapprox ] ) is a good numerical approximation to the original integrand , if it is a smooth enough function .",
    "however , because it involves replacing final - state momenta by somewhat different momenta , the approximation will change certain kinds of cross sections differential in the final state .",
    "even when we only treat inclusive cross sections , the changes in the kinematics affect the positions of thresholds .",

    "now , the integral on the right - hand side is uv - divergent in a renormalizable theory like qcd so , as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ oldpdf ] ) is ill - defined and needs to be replaced by something else .",
    "the divergence comes from regions of the integral where @xmath55 and @xmath2 are large , i.e. , from values of @xmath18 that are far from parton kinematics .",

    "( [ oldpdf ] ) near the hard scale , @xmath56  @xcite . while physically plausible , such a definition has problems when one tries to make it gauge invariant  the same problems that we will have to solve in our improved treatment with parton correlation functions .",

    "so far , the factorization formula we have derived involves a rather trivial hard scattering coefficient .",
    "however , having precisely formulated the factorization for the zeroth order hard scattering , the structure of higher order hard scattering coefficients can be readily determined using the subtraction formalism .",
    "a calculation of this type is in progress .",
    "we expect that a reasonably straightforward generalization of the methods of ref .  @xcite will be suitable .",
    "thus the hard scattering will be obtained from on - shell partonic cross sections with subtractions that compensate double counting with regions associated with lower - order hard scattering .",
    "the subtractions remove singular contributions where some of the partons in the hard scattering become collinear or soft .",
    "because of our use of exact parton kinematics , the subtractions will be applied point - by - point in parton momentum , and will result in hard scattering coefficients that are ordinary integrable functions of external parton momenta .",
    "thus they will correctly represent the corrections to parton probabilities differential in parton kinematics .",
    "in contrast , standard methods of collinear factorization result in hard - scattering coefficients that contain non - trivial generalized functions , e.g. , the well - known plus distributions .",
    "such distributions are very singular and can not represent the detailed differential distribution of parton kinematics .",
    "they only give correct results for cross sections that involve a broad average over parton kinematics .",
    "there is still much work to do .",
    "first , the evolution equations for the pcfs need to be derived , presumably a natural generalization of the the css equations .",
    "then we need to obtain methods for higher - order corrections to the hard scattering matrix elements .",
    "we need to extend the derivations to a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "in addition , we need to determine if and how this formalism can be recast in terms of pcfs defined with light - like wilson lines , but with factors that cancel light - cone divergences , as in @xcite .",

    "consider the contribution to the outgoing jet bubble represented by the following sum of graphs : @xmath164{appb_graph1}\\ ] ] here the outgoing quark attaches to two additional gluons as it enters the final state on the left side of the final state cut .",

    "the soft gluon insertion is represented by the attachment with a double line and arrow , indicating that we have made the approximations discussed in the main text that lead to eq .",

    "in particular , the soft momentum , @xmath149 has been contracted with the soft gluon vertex , and there is a division by @xmath165 .",

    "now we notice that we can eliminate quark propagators and utilize the dirac equation by substituting the following trivial identities for @xmath170 : @xmath171 these are each of the form of a difference of the denominators for the two quark lines next to the vertex for the @xmath149 gluon , so that @xmath172 in the sum , all the intermediate terms cancel , to leave only the last term , @xmath173 the soft gluon @xmath149 has been factored out of the rest of the graph leaving only an over - all factor corresponding to the eikonal line propagator and eikonal vertex .",

    "figure  [ appb_wi_multa ] can be re - written in a way that corresponds more directly with the feynman rules of wilson lines if we note that the product of eikonal propagators can be written as , @xmath179 \\left [ n_j \\cdot ( h_1 + h_2 ) \\right ]   \\times \\cdots \\times \\left [ n_j \\cdot ( h_1 + h_2 + \\cdots + h_{n_s } ) \\right ] } .\\ ] ] the summation sign means that we sum over all permutations of the momenta @xmath180 in the denominator on the right side .",
