    "physics of ultracold atoms is fascinating in many respects .",
    "the ways how these systems can be manipulated in magnetic and optical traps open possibilities to an enormous number of physical effects which can be realized and studied in these systems @xcite , hofstetter .",
    "thanks to a large variety of experimental techniques one can manipulate atomic gases by magnetic and electromagnetic fields giving rise to realization of various macroscopic quantum effects .",
    "first of all , a number of effects known in standard superfluids and superconductors were already realized in ultracold atomic gases @xcite , hofstetter . in that sense a number of already developed theoretical methods and ideas in solid state physics were used in physics of ultracold atoms . on the other hand this fascinating field gives us new possibilities in studying many aspects of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and of the superfluidity of fermi condensates ( bcs ) which are difficult to realize in solid state physics .",
    "for instance in an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms , such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 , one can study bose - einstein condensation(bec ) .",
    "if instead we deal with a gas of _ fermionic atoms _ , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , one can study not only fermionic superfluidity ( bcs ) but also the transition bec - bcs by directly controlling the interaction ( scattering length ) between atoms @xcite .",
    "then by tuning magnetic field in magnetic traps and/or electromagnetic field in optical lattices one can vary the atomic scattering length @xmath16 in a broad range ( especially for energies just near the feshbach resonance ) , that even bcs - like pairing of ultracold atoms can be realized with @xmath17 .",
    "it seems that this possibility is already realized with ultracold fermionic alkali gases @xmath18 and @xmath15 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the cooling of  a magnetically trapped spin - polarized @xmath15 fermi gas up to @xmath19 atoms at @xmath20 @xmath21 and up to @xmath22 atoms at @xmath23 @xmath21 is already realized .",
    "the strength of the atomic interaction was controlled by applying a magnetic field and tuning to feshbach resonances , which occur when the total energy of interacting particles in open channels is the same as the energy of a bound molecular state in closed channels .",
    "for such a two - level fermionic system it was proposed by the present author and his collaborator in the paper `` inhomogeneous superconducting phase in absence of paramagnetic effect '' a bcs - like model for the _ `` isotopic spin '' pairing _ of two ( or more ) species @xcite - the @xmath24 model .",
    "the basic ingredient of the @xmath24 model is that two species ( atoms , electrons , quarks , nucleons , etc . )",
    "may have either different kinetic energies , or different energy levels ( or chemical potentials ) , i.e there is a mismatch of energy levels of fermionic atoms which participate in pairing .",
    "it turns out that this model is an adequate theoretical framework for a number of experimental situations which deal with ultracold fermionic alkali gases , such as for instance @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the present experimental techniques allow realizations of systems with two ( or more ) hyperfine levels .",
    "they can be furthermore manipulated in order to maintain various kinds of atomic pairing from bcs - like to strong coupling case as well as to realize the mismatch between the paired `` isotopic '' atomic levels ( chemical potential ) .",
    "for further application of this model see below .    in the following we apply this model in studying nonuniform superfluidity in ultracold fermionic atomic gases ( @xmath0 ) with oscillating order parameter @xmath25 - which is due to the mismatch effect of two hyperfine states of fermionic atoms .",
    "this effect is analogous to the larkin - ovchinikov - fulde - ferrell ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) phase in superconductors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "based on this effect we propose a novel josephson junction ( @xmath28 ) where the left and right superfluid ( @xmath29 )  gases have uniform order parameters @xmath30 , while the weak link ( @xmath4 )  with the mismatch effect is in the normal state .",
    "this gives rise to an oscillating superfluid amplitude inside the weak link @xmath4 and as a result the so - called @xmath2-junction can be realized .",
    "we show that if such a junction is a part of the closed ring then _ spontaneous and dissipationless superfluid current _ can flow through the ring depending on the size of the ring . in that case",
    "there is _ spontaneous breaking of the time - reversal _ in the system .",
    "finally , we discuss possible realizations and generalizations of this novel effect in ultracold fermionic gases .",
    "the model with the `` isotope - spin '' pairing ( @xmath24 ) @xcite is a generalization of the bcs pairing mechanism to systems with internal degrees of freedom such as for instance , _ nuclear matter _ - with isospin numbers , _ quark matter _ - with the color and flavor quantum numbers , _ ultracold fermionic gases _ - with quantum numbers of the hyperfine atomic states , _ layered _ and _ multiband superconductors _ - with quantum numbers enumerating layers and bands .",
    "the pairing constituents ( electrons , nucleons , quarks , neutral atoms , etc . ) can be either charged or not and in those cases we deal either with real superconductivity or with superfluidity of matter .",
    "all these systems posses a natural mismatch in energies ( or masses ) of constituents participating in pairing .",
    "this is an important property since in the case when the mismatch parameter @xmath1 is of the order of the bare superconducting gap @xmath31 a nonuniform superfluidity ( superconductivity ) is realized - an analogue of the @xmath26 state in metallic superconductors placed in the zeeman field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath24 model is given by @xcite    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    the @xmath24 order parameter @xmath35    @xmath36    in the following we shall study the bcs - like pairing and josephson effect in ultracold fermionic alkaline gases ( @xmath0 )  in which case @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 only - see the explanation below , while the electronic spin states @xmath40 and @xmath41 do not enter ( they are accounted for via @xmath42 ) . for simplicity",
    "we omit indices @xmath42 in @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 . in the case of two ( @xmath45 )  `` isotopic '' bands with the mismatch in their energies ( or chemical potentials ) - the _ `` isotopic '' band splitting _ ( @xmath1 ) -",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum is given by @xmath46note , that the splitting parameter @xmath1 can in principle depend on momenta too , but the results obtained below are qualitatively valid also in this case .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the above model and some physical results @xcite were frequently used later on in studying diverse physical problems such as : ( @xmath47 ) _ ultracold _ _ fermionic atomic gases _ - where @xmath48 enumerate hyperfine atomic states of alkali atoms ; ( @xmath49 ) in _ quantum chromodynamics _ - where the problem of pairing in the quark matter , i.e. , the _ color superconductivity _ ( @xmath50 ) , was studied @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the @xmath50 pairing of the colored quarks is mathematically more complicated than the standard bcs case , since the former system is characterized by the matrix coupling constant @xmath51 in the internal degrees of freedom , where @xmath52 are quantum numbers of quarks : @xmath53 - _ color _ ;",
    "@xmath54 - _ flavor _",
    "( up , down , strange , ... ) ; @xmath55 - _ spin_. at the same time the hamiltonian @xmath56 ( for instance the nambu - lasinio hamiltonian ) , which is an analogue of the bcs one in the @xmath50 pairing , must be invariant under the symmetry group of strong interactions @xmath57 - see rischke .",
    "let us mention some application of this model in _ _  the solid state physics _ _ such as _ _  bi - layered superconductors _ _ in the presence of the zeeman effect ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{zeeman}\\]]it turns out that the paramagnetic field @xmath60 can compensate the `` isotopic '' mismatch of the chemical potentials ( @xmath61 ) giving rise to some novel effects @xcite .",
    "for instance , in case when @xmath62 superconductivity is destroyed by the isotopic - splitting @xmath1 , while the zeeman term can compensate this mismatch and thus inducing superconductivity for @xmath63 - the _ reentrant superconductivity",
    "recently , similar effects were found to exist in layered superconductors placed in the zeeman field @xmath60 buzdin - layered . in that case",
    "the bi - layer superconductivity was studied in the model ( similar to that in eq.([h0]-[bcs ] ) ) with the _ intralayer _ pairing @xmath9 only . in that case the interplane hoping ( @xmath64 ) in the bi - layer system plays the role of the `` isotopic '' splitting parameter , i.e. @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are  the bonding ( @xmath67 ) and antibonding ( @xmath68 ) bands , respectively .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath69 the bi - layer superconductivity is realized , i.e , @xmath70 , while for @xmath71 it is destroyed , i.e. , @xmath72 . however , for @xmath73 superconductivity appears again ( reentrant superconductivity ) on the expense of the @xmath2-phase difference between the order parameters on the bilayer ( in the up- and down - plane ) , i.e. @xmath74 . in the language of the @xmath24 model",
    "there is a pairing between the antibonding and bonding levels only , i.e. , @xmath75 while @xmath76 .",
    "this result is of a potential interest in high - temperature superconductors , especially in bi - layer bisco .",
    "one expects that similar effects can be realized also in the _ quark matter _ with the color superconductivity ( @xmath50 ) with two flavor quarks , such as pulsars - magnetars , where the @xmath50 gap is @xmath77 @xmath78 which is of the order of mass difference @xmath79 @xmath78 between up and down quark .",
    "having in mind that the magnetic field in magnetars is huge , @xmath80 , then the above compensating effect ( by magnetic field and zeeman effect ) might be operative there .",
    "the @xmath24 model renders a number of interesting effects and some of them were discussed in @xcite . in the following",
    "we study systems with two levels @xmath45 only and apply it to the ultracold fermionic gases .",
    "it is assumed pairing between two species @xmath81 for @xmath39 , only .",
    "this two - state model is realistic approximation since in diluted gases , for instance in @xmath15 , the interaction of atoms in different hyperfine states is several order of magnitude larger than in the same states @xcite .",
    "recently , the fermionic superfluidity was realized recently by several groups @xcite .",
    "however , the definitive experimental prove of the fermionic superfluidity was given recently in the remarkable experiment of the ketterle s group @xcite .",
    "they cooled @xmath15 in magnetic trap below the fermi degeneracy .",
    "this fermi cloud , consisting of approximately@xmath82 atoms with two lowest hyperfine states @xmath83 and @xmath84 , was loaded into an optical dipole trap . between these states",
    "there is a feshbach resonance at @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "the bec - bcs transition occurs in the region between 780 g and 925 g , where for @xmath87 @xmath88 the system is in the bcs side . since the ( attractive ) coupling between atoms in states @xmath83 and @xmath84 at low t is strong in the @xmath89-channel , this means that the spatial part of the two - body wave function @xmath90 is symmetric under the exchange of atoms , i.e. @xmath91 . as the result the spin part of the wave function is antisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "\\label{spin}\\]]the pairing is strong between the states @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath93 while @xmath94 . the crucial observation in @xcite was the creation of vortices in the rotating systems above some rotation frequency , what can be considered as a definite prove for fermionic superfluidity .",
    "since the @xmath24  model strongly reminds on metallic superconductors with the zeeman ( paramagnetic ) effect , this analogy might be useful in studying ultracold fermionic gases .",
    "_ first _ , in the case when the `` isotope '' splitting is larger than the critical value @xmath95 , then in the region @xmath96 ( at @xmath97 @xmath98 ) a _ nonmagnetic analogue _ of the @xmath26 phase is realized with the nonuniform order parameter @xmath99",
    ". for @xmath100 the modulation vector @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the fermi velocity .",
    "it is known that the structure of the order parameter may contain more wave vectors @xmath104 thus making the so called crystalline structure more favorable @xcite - this ( still unsolved ) problem is not the subject of this paper . concerning the critical value @xmath105 it depends on dimensionality of the system - in 3d one has @xmath106 , in 2d @xmath107 while for 1d @xmath108 .",
    "note , that for @xmath109 ( at @xmath97 k ) the system is in uniform superfluid ( superconducting ) state , i.e. @xmath110 . the transition at @xmath105 depends on the type of the nonuniform solution - for instance for the one plane solution we use here ( only for simplicity ) the transition at ( @xmath97 , @xmath111 ) is second order .",

    "second , it turns out that the @xmath26 state appears at temperatures @xmath114 and in the phase diagram there is a tricritical lifshitz point ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .",
    "near this point  one can perform the ginzburg - landau ( @xmath117 ) expansion analogously to that obtained in @xcite , @xcite . in order to prove the existence of the @xmath2- junction in the superfluid @xmath0 we shall study the nonuniform superfluidity near the point ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) where it is straightforward to derive the @xmath117 expansion by using eqs.([bcs]-[gap ] ) . as the result the ( dimensionless ) density of the free - energy functional @xmath120 ( where @xmath121 is the condensation energy and @xmath122 ) is given by buku - glexpansion , @xcite @xmath123@xmath124here , @xmath125/t^{\\ast } $ ] , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the transition temperature from the normal ( @xmath129 ) to the uniform bcs state but in the absence of the @xmath26 state .",

    "we shall demonstrate below that in principle it is possible to have a @xmath2-_josephson contact ( weak link ) _ based on cold fermionic gases which is analogous to the so called @xmath152 contacts ( weak links ) in the solid state physics , where in the ferromagnetic weak link ( @xmath153 ) electrons with different spin projections have different energies ( zeeman - mismatch ) . in this case",
