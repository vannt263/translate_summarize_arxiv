    "the exploration of galaxies at cosmological distances has sensibly changed the current perspective of optical astronomy , as the effect of redshift is to allow the study of the restframe ultraviolet ( uv ) emission of distant objects .",
    "the lack of a reliable overlap with local galaxy templates ( mainly due to the atmosphere absorption ) , and the possible effect of evolution , require however a more accurate modelling of galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at short wavelength in order to consistently match high - redshift observations ( buzzoni 2002a )",
    ".    sampling of integrated uv emission from the galaxy population at increasing distances has revealed to be in principle a powerful tool to track cosmic star formation at the different cosmological epochs ( madau 1998 ) . for its relevance , this method has received special attention in a number of works , considering the possible bias sources in the data interpretation . this included the effect of dust ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; massarotti et al .  2001 ) , and the incomplete sampling of galaxy luminosity function at faint magnitudes ( connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) . in any case",
    ", as far as evolution is taken into account , important changes are to be expected for galaxies beyond @xmath0 , both in their apparent morphology and uv emission . in this contribution , i would like to briefly assess both issues and their possible influence in the interpretation of deep observations .",
    "uv luminosity is known to be a fairly accurate tracer of actual star formation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this relationship basically derives from a selective contribution of the brightest main sequence ( ms ) stars to the integrated luminosity of a stellar aggregate .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 , by comparing the theoretical c - m diagram of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) in two different photometric bands .",
    "as far as 2000   luminosity distribution is concerned ( left panel in the figure ) , one sees that a substantial fraction of the ssp luminosity is provided by turn off ( to ) stars in the brighter magnitude bin of the ms region .",
    "quite remarkably , giant stars nearly disappear in the ultraviolet , while on the contrary they extensively contribute to the integrated luminosity at optical and infrared wavelength ( right panel ) . as a consequence of this selective mechanism , the integrated uv luminosity directly relates , at any time , to the actual star formation rate , once linking the youngest component of high - mass stars to the size of the stellar population as a whole , through an appropriate imf . in case of a salpeter imf , with stars in the mass range between 0.1 and 120  m@xmath1 ,",
    "a theoretical calibration for the 2800   luminosity ( buzzoni 2002b ) is : @xmath2 } =   { { l_{2800}}\\over { 4.8\\,10^{27 } } } \\quad { \\rm [ erg / sec / hz]},\\ ] ] quite insensitive to the details of past star formation history ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "another important issue that should be considered , when tackling the study of the high - redshift galaxy population , is the possible morphological evolution . apart from dynamical arguments ( that deal , for instance , with the `` monolithic '' or `` hierarchical '' formation hypothesis )",
    ", the apparent effect of redshift on the sampled sed , and the different photometric evolution of the galaxy sub - systems ( i.e.  bulge , disk and halo ) likely tend to change the apparent look of galaxies with changing distance .",
    "the are basically two `` competing '' effects , in this sense , that could introduce an important bias in the morphological classification with increasing @xmath3 .    from one hand , in case of late - type systems",
    ", uv luminosity especially enhances the presence of star - formation regions across the disk .",
    "when shifted to optical wavelength ( i.e.  for galaxies at @xmath0 or beyond ) this makes the disk plot much more knotty and irregular , compared with low - redshift templates ( and this , _ in spite _ of any intrinsic evolution ... ) .",
    "simulations actually show that outstanding local galaxies , like m33 or m51 , could hardly be recognized at the distance of the hubble deep field ( burgarella et al .",
    "2001 ; kuchinski et al .",
    "when compared with local morphological studies , the net effect of sampling the galaxy uv spectral range is therefore in the sense of artificially increasing the number of irregular ( interactive ? ) systems at high redshift ( van den bergh et al .",
    "2000 ; kajisawa & yamada 2001 ) .",
    "to some extent , this trend could even be reinforced by the abrupt disappearence of early - type systems beyond @xmath4 , mainly as a consequence of the disfavoring action of the k - correction .",
    "on the other hand , we should also consider the effect of photometric evolution when moving to large look - back times .",
    "we know that bulge stellar population in spirals closely resembles that of ellipticals ( e.g.  jablonka et al .",
    "1996 ) , and consistently matches the theoretical case of a ssp .",
    "this means that bulge luminosity is expected to fade with time , as a consequence of the increasing number of dead stars and a prevailing dominance of low - mass stars . on the contrary ,",
    "the disk undergoes more or less continual stars formation allover galaxy s life , and its luminosity is therefore dominated at any time by fresh ( high - mass ) stars .",
    "therefore , when looking back in time , we should in general expect a more prominent contribution of the bulge over the disk , and high - redshift spirals ( and ellipticals ) should more likely appear as sharply nucleated objects , compared to their low - redshift homologues .",
    "this would explain the apparent lack of grand - design spirals ( i.e.  sb - sc systems ) in the galaxy population at large distances ( e.g.  van den bergh et al .",
    "the effect is quantified in the two panels of fig .  3 , where we computed the relative contribution of the spheroid component ( i.e.  bulge+halo ) to galaxy luminosity at red / infrared and ultraviolet wavelength ( johnson @xmath5 band ) .",
    "when accounting for expected photometric evolution , according to buzzoni s ( 2002b ) template galaxy models , one sees that later - type spirals ( sc - sd types ) at 1 gyr might closely look like present - day s0-sa systems .",
    "the combined action of the morphological and photometric evolution is expected to sensibly modulate the galaxy luminosity function at high redshift .",
    "a main issue , in this regard , concerns the shape of the faint - end tail of the schechter ( 1976 ) function , sizing the contribution of dwarf systems .",
    "this problem has at least a twofold impact on the cosmological theory as _ i ) _ faint galaxies might provide a large fraction of the uv cosmological background ( adelberger and steidel 2000 ) , thus sensibly increasing the estimated cosmic star formation according to the madau ( 1998 ) plot ; _ ii ) _ low - mass systems could play a key role in the physical mechanisms that led to formation of the high - mass galaxies ( white et al .",
    "1987 ) .    as a first plain approach to the problem , we relied on the work of marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who investigated the dependence of the local galaxy luminosity function on morphology using a wide sample of over 5,000 low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the marzke et al .",
    "luminosity function , obtained in the johnson @xmath6 band , is displayed in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 , together with the relative contributions from _ bona fide _",
    "`` elliptical '' , `` spiral '' , and `` irregular '' galaxies .",
    "the faint - end slope of the data distribution ( i.e.  the power - law index @xmath7 of the schechter function ) is found to be @xmath8 for the whole sample over the observed magnitude range , but irregular galaxies clearly dominate at fainter magnitudes with a steeper slope ( @xmath9 ) . starting from this partition , and accounting for the mean @xmath10 color as from the buzzoni ( 2002b ) template models , in the middle panel of fig .",
    "4 we report the inferred luminosity function at the 2000   restframe wavelength . the main feature , in this regard , is the dramatic fading of elliptical galaxies , as a consequence of their exceedingly `` red '' @xmath10 color due to a vanishing star formation at present time . quite interestingly , this makes the faint - end slope of the schechter function even steeper ( @xmath11  ? ) , as ellipticals will now reinforce the i m contribution at faint magnitudes .    on the other hand , if we let galaxies evolve back in time and consider the luminosity partition for 5 gyr models ( this is roughly the expected scenario for @xmath12 galaxies , depending on the cosmological model ) , then the restframe @xmath13 luminosity function will match observations along the @xmath14 bands ( cf .",
    "right panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "again , while the bright galaxy population is clearly dominated by late - type systems , and the i m galaxy component moves to fainter magnitudes ( because of a lower contribution of unevolved low - mass stars ) , ellipticals partially recover due to the age effect .",
    "our guess is therefore that deep optical observations should point to a steeper slope for the faint - end tail of the luminosity function , compared to the local framework ( cf .  the solid line in the right panel of fig .  4 , for reference )",
    ", with a value of @xmath7 eventually comprised between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this trend could even be strenghtened as far as the effect of dust or the c - m galaxy drift is taken into account , in a more sophisticated approach .",
    "both effects lead in fact to predict redder ( i.e.  uv fainter ) galaxies at brighter magnitudes , and this is in the sense of steepening the faint - end tail of the uv galaxy luminosity function ."
