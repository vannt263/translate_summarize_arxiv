    "diffusion processes , when seen as the continuous limit of a random walk , are well known to display uncanny properties when the associated probability distribution of length or duration steps for a walker possesses diverging moments . among these unusual diffusion processes , lvy flights have been extensively studied on lattices and continuous media @xcite as they can display _ superdiffusion _ , so that the variance of the distance covered during the process grows superlinearly @xmath2 with @xmath3 at odds with linear diffusion for the brownian motion @xcite .",
    "this enhanced diffusion entails an efficient exploration of the space in which the diffusion process takes place : thus both in natural contexts and in artificial ones lvy flights have emerged as a strategic choice for such an exploration and for search strategies @xcite . in the case of lvy flights ,",
    "the whole process relies on the divergence of the second moment of the jump probability distribution @xmath4 , i.e. the probability to perform a jump of length @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the walker is allowed to perform very long jumps , the flights , which give , as macroscopic effect , the aforementioned superlinear growth of the total displacement variance @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if we focus on the temporal properties of the diffusion , we can introduce for the walker a waiting time probability distribution @xmath6 determining the probability of jumping after a time @xmath7 has elapsed since the last move .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , assuming its first moment is divergent , a subdiffusive behaviour can emerge due to the occurrence of very long waiting times that slow down the dynamics , i.e. @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these two ingredients , the jump length and the waiting time distributions can be blended to create a richer phenomenology as it is possible to steer from the subdiffusive regime to the superdiffusive one by tuning the power law distribution exponents of the jump and waiting time probabilities @xcite .    in the framework we just described , anomalous diffusion arises from such a choice of the probability distributions for jumps and rest times but it",
    "could be unleashed by other properties of the walkers motion . in this work ,",
    "we adopt precisely this perspective : in our model we rely on setting _ microscopic",
    "_ rules for the walker s displacement so that each `` flight '' is seen as the result as a series of @xmath0 unitary very small hops , as in fig .  [ fig : hops ] .",
    "anomalous diffusion will therefore stem without the need of an _ a priori _ knowledge of the jump length , as in the canonical lvy flight frame , but it shall be the macroscopic manifestation of such a fragmented and microscopic walk .    the fundamental pivot for the analysis will thus be to relate these microscopic displacements with a macroscopic jump probability distribution @xmath4 .",
    ", we investigate this relation on a 1-d chain where we derive an analytical form for the @xmath4 distribution as well as an explicit formula for the displacement variance @xmath10 .",
    "our main result will be that , under suitable conditions on the elementary micro - steps distribution @xmath1 , the walker can indeed exhibit nonlinear diffusion .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : themodel ] we introduce the model and we demonstrate that the probability distribution of the jumps @xmath4 can display a divergent second moment .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : flights ]",
    ", we calculate the probability distribution for the walker that , having in the asymptotic limit a stretched exponential form , leads to a superdiffusive behaviour . in sec .  [",
    "sec : simus ] we show some numerical simulations and we conclude in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] with some final remarks .",

    "b ) we present a possible avalanche , the walker performs @xmath12 hops , two in the positive direction and @xmath13 in the negative one , for a total effective displacement of @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig : hops ] ]",
    "in our model , we consider walkers moving on a @xmath15-d lattice able of performing _ elementary steps _ of unitary length , say @xmath16 and @xmath17 , both with equal probability @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hops ] . at each time step , the walker is able to perform @xmath0 such elementary steps , where @xmath0 is extracted by some probability distribution function . in the following",
    "we will assume the latter to follow a power law distribution of exponent @xmath3 : @xmath18\\text { and } p_n=\\frac{c_{\\gamma}}{n^{\\gamma}}\\quad \\forall n\\geq 1\\ , , } } \\ ] ] being @xmath19 a normalising factor and @xmath20 the riemann @xmath21-function . if the probability of not performing any elementary jumps @xmath22 then the walker can remain stuck in its current position without doing any elementary steps ; on the other hand if @xmath23 the walker , at each time step , always performs some elementary jumps , whose possible outcome may eventually be returning to its starting position .    as we sketched in the introduction , the pivotal passage for the analysis",
    "is to determine the probability @xmath24 to perform a total jump of length @xmath25 for some @xmath26 in a time step .",
    "assume the walker performs @xmath0 elementary steps , then the probability of making @xmath27 steps in the positive direction , and thus @xmath28 in the negative one , is given by a binomial process @xmath29 , hence the total length will result to be @xmath30 .",
    "in conclusion we can found : @xmath31 being the last term the probability of performing a total jump of length @xmath32 because the walker did not move at all .",
    "the probability to have @xmath32 is composed by this term and an additional one , given by @xmath33 , which accounts for the case the walker makes an even number of elementary steps whose total sum is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "let us observe that , given @xmath25 , not all the values of @xmath0 do contribute to the sum : to ensure the positivity of the binomial coefficient , we must require @xmath35 and their sum should be an even number , @xmath36 , i.e. they should be both odd or even at the same time .",
    "the function @xmath24 is even , as we demonstrate in appendix  [ app : properties ] ; we can thus restrict ourselves to @xmath37 and rewrite eq .   for even integers @xmath38",
    "as follows : @xmath39 ( note that @xmath40 is not allowed in the sum because it is taken into account thanks to the term @xmath41 ) and the case @xmath32 reads @xmath42 for odd integers @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 having computed the probability @xmath24 , we now focus on its momenta , in particular the second one as its divergence is known to cause the departure from normal diffusion @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 be independent random variables such that @xmath46 , that is @xmath47 is the displacement of the walker at the @xmath48th jump , then one can define @xmath49 to be the walker position after @xmath50 time steps . because of the parity property of @xmath24 one gets @xmath51 , an thus @xmath52 for all @xmath27 ( see appedix  [ app : properties ] ) .",
    "using this last remark one can compute the mean square deviation ( msd ) as @xmath53 and thus @xmath54 where we used the definition of @xmath24 and we rearranged the terms in the sum .",
    "this latter expression acquires a far simpler form ( see lemma  [ lem : cn ] in appendix  [ app : proof ] and the probability distribution eq .  ):",
    "@xmath55 and thus @xmath56 in conclusion , if @xmath57 the walker undergoes a linear diffusion process , @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath59 we can not conclude anything using the previous analysis ; to overcome this difficulty we will consider separately the case @xmath59 in the next section .",
    "although eq .   has proven the divergence of the msd when the @xmath60 with @xmath59 , we do not possess so far any information on how , from a functional perspective , this divergence impacts on the probability distribution .",
    "let us define @xmath61 the probability for the walker to be at distance @xmath62 from the starting position after exactly @xmath50 time steps , that is @xmath63 . then using the independence of each jump one can derive the following relation : @xmath64 that is the probability to be at distance @xmath62 at step @xmath65 is given by the probability to be one step before at some position @xmath66 and then make a jump of length @xmath25 . to disentangle this",
    "convolution is customary to pass in the fourier space : @xmath67 hence using eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain @xmath68 from which , by iteration , the following expression results @xmath69 and , applying the inverse fourier transform , one can recover @xmath61 from @xmath70 eq .",
    "illustrates how , from the behaviour of @xmath71 for @xmath72 , one can deduce the behaviour of @xmath73 and thus of @xmath61 in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath74 .",
    "we lever here this standard result to circumvent the divergence in eq .   and , in order to unveil the divergence rate of the msd , we shall focus on the behaviour of @xmath71 for small @xmath75 in the following . as we detail in appendix",
    "[ app : lambda ] , we are able to explicitly cast it in the form @xmath76 let us define @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then , using the chosen form for @xmath1 , we can rewrite eq .   as : @xmath79 to determine the dependence on @xmath80 in the sum we use the following approximation : @xmath81 for any @xmath82- let us remember that we are interested in @xmath83 and thus @xmath84- we can define @xmath85 and thus change the integration variable form @xmath86 to @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is defined by the last equality .",
    "we note that for @xmath90 then @xmath91 .",
    "so , in conclusion we obtain @xmath92 where we used the fact that @xmath93 .",
    "back to @xmath71 we obtain for @xmath94 being @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we thus have , from eq .  , for small @xmath75 @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , in the limit of large @xmath50 , the above expression tends to the stretched exponential form typical of lvy flights characteristic function : @xmath100 the inverse fourier transform of the characteristic function in eq .   does not have a straightforward analytical expression and , being non - analytic , the evaluation of the msd using the @xmath101 is impeded because the expression diverges .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to exploit the self - similarity property of the distribution in order to obtain a scaling relation showing the impact of the local exponent @xmath102 on the .",
    "using , we can thus recast the inverse fourier transform @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a function of the sole variable @xmath106 . as a closure to the present section we would like to make a remark on the probability of @xmath41 .",
    "let us observe that the walker will always perform lvy flights for any @xmath107 , being the impact of @xmath41 only on @xmath108 , more precisely @xmath109 when @xmath110 , but not on the exponent @xmath111 .",
    "only in the extremal case @xmath112 the walk degenerates into an absence of movement .",
    "in the previous section we considered a discrete time process in which the steps occurred at a regular pace . in this section we extend our analysis introducing in our description the waiting time probability distribution , which allows the walker to wait for a time interval @xmath7 before hopping again .",
    "thus our process is now composed by two moves : a waiting time , whose length is weighted by a distribution @xmath6 , and a dynamicphase in which @xmath0 elementary steps are instantaneously performed . in our approach , we consider the probability distributions and @xmath6 as independent and the dynamic phase can be interpreted as the flights in our model since it does not take time , similarly to the classical lvy flights . with these hypotheses ,",
    "the derivation of the final probability distribution in fourier - laplace space @xmath113 is straightforward in the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) frame @xcite , but we detail here the passages for the sake of completeness .",
    "the walker can , as before , perform @xmath0 microscopic moves : in panel a ) these macro - movements result in displacements of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath114 .",
    "if we introduce the waiting times , the displacements are interspersed by waiting intervals : in panel b ) the walker stays put from @xmath116 to @xmath117 and from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "[ fig : hops_time ] ]    we thus assume that the walker starts at @xmath120 and let @xmath121 be the probability distribution function of the occurrence of the @xmath50th jump at time @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the waiting time drawn at the @xmath48th jump.one clearly has @xmath124 @xmath125 now that the distribution @xmath126 accounts for the non - linear relation between steps and time , we can proceed to include it within the definition of the @xmath127 , i.e. the probability for the walker to be at distance @xmath62 from the origin ( the initial point at time @xmath120 ) at time @xmath7 .",
    "we observe that this probability is a generalisation of the previously defined @xmath61 : of course , in case all the waiting times are equal to the duration of the rest period , @xmath128 , then @xmath127 reduces to @xmath61 where @xmath129 , as we had in eq .  . using our starting hypotheses , i.e. that the jumps are costless in time and the waiting time is uncorrelated with the jumps ,",
    "we can write @xmath130 meaning that the probability @xmath127 is the probability to be at @xmath62 after exactly @xmath50 steps times the probability to have performed @xmath50 steps in the time interval @xmath7 . using once again the laplace transform for time , fourier for space and the result of the previous section we arrive at the classical result @xcite : @xmath131 we thus have that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath127 shall be governed , in the @xmath132 limit , by the moments of the @xmath71 and @xmath133 in the corresponding limit @xmath134 in the fourier - laplace space . therefore we combine the approximation of @xmath71 in eq .   with a waiting time distribution",
    "a power - law form @xmath135 with @xmath136 for @xmath137 . in order to investigate if the waiting time distribution interferes , we focus , for the jump part , on the interesting case where @xmath138 as we demonstrated in the previous section that it leads the second spatial moment to diverge . passing to fourier - laplace space , the laplace transform of @xmath6",
    "reads @xmath139 for small @xmath80 by virtue of the tauberian theorem and , substituting the approximation of @xmath71 and @xmath133 in eq .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath140 we then extrapolate the scaling behaviour in the same fashion we derived eq .",
    ", where now both the exponents @xmath141 and @xmath102 intervene in the temporal scaling @xcite @xmath142",
    "the aim of this section is to present some numerical results to support the theory presented above .",
    "we are left now with the numerical evaluation of the to confirm the impact brought by the local exponents @xmath141 and @xmath102 on the overall diffusion process .",
    "( a ) ( b )    \\(a ) ( b )    as a closing note , it is worth mentioning that other methods exists to tame the numerical instability and investigate , albeit indirectly , the theoretical scaling of such as computing the fractional moments @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 @xcite , the mean of the displacements @xmath146 logarithm , called the geometric mean @xmath147 @xcite and , finally , computing the probability density averaged within a box with time depending bounds @xmath148 $ ] @xcite .",
    "concluding , in this work we introduced a random walk model igniting a lvy flight type of behaviour and leading to superdiffusion on a one dimensional lattice .",
    "the specificity of this model is to impose a microscopic condition on the walk , with no need for an a priori knowledge of the topology in order to perform the jumps . in our approach",
    ", one jump event corresponds to an `` avalanche '' of @xmath0 elementary steps , whose size @xmath0 is distributed according to a probability distribution @xmath1 .",
    "we then demonstrated that a power law form @xmath60 entails the divergence of the second moment of the jumps length distribution when .",
    "starting from this divergence , we derived , in sec .",
    "[ sec : flights ] , the probability distribution @xmath149 in fourier space which has the characteristic stretched exponential form .",
    "we furthermore introduced the possibility for the walker to stay put on a in sec .",
    "[ sec : wt2 ] , showing finally , in sec.[sec : simus ] we confirmed through direct numerical simulation the analytical behaviour on a closing note , we would like to stress that the approach itself is independent of the functional form and that it could be generalised to other distributions . the actual meaningful information carried by the is the creation of a divergence in the distribution .",
    "it is worth of note that this divergence stems from the interplay of both the shape and the @xmath150 topology ; therefore a careful choice of the former might be a way to create anomalous diffusion in more general network topologies .",
    "widening further our perspective , the walk described in this paper could be used when the underlying space does not possess a proper metric and is small - world , as in the case of complex networks @xcite , such that the probability to perform a walk at a certain distance is not univocally defined . in that case , adopting a local perspective for the walker dynamics might prove useful to test the notion of anomalous diffusion @xcite . another possible application",
