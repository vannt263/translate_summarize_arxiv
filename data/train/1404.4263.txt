    "in 1976 jackiw and rebbi @xcite introduced the important concept of the fractional fermion number of the solitons , considering two different fermion - soliton models , one of them in one and the other in three spatial dimensions . in both models ,",
    "the key observations that lead to the fractional charge of the soliton are that the models possess charge conjugation symmetry and also there is a nondegenerate zero - energy fermionic mode .",
    "they showed that in the presence of the zero mode the prescribed soliton is a degenerate doublet carrying charge @xmath7 . in the ensuing decades",
    "there has been a vast number of works confirming and elaborating on the j - r finding .",
    "this discovery has motivated much of the works on this subject and the concept of the vacuum polarization by background fields has been investigated in many branches of physics such as particle physics @xcite , cosmology @xcite , condensed - matter physics @xcite , polymer physics @xcite and atomic physics @xcite .    we now explain some of these works which are relevant to this paper . in 1981",
    "goldstone and wilczek @xcite invented a powerful method , called the adiabatic method , for calculating the vacuum polarization of fermions induced by the background solitons . in this method the final topological background field , which is assumed to be slowly varying in space , is considered to be slowly evolving from the topologically trivial configuration . using their method , they investigated some models which lack the symmetry in the energy spectrum of the fermion and showed that the fermion number of the vacuum can be any real number and not just @xmath7 . later on this method was generalized by mackenzie and wilczek @xcite . in their method",
    "the requirement of the slow spatial variation of the background field was lifted and therefore they could consider models including solitons with arbitrary variations in the space . using their method , they concluded that sharply varying solitons can never polarize the vacuum .",
    "following these works , some authors used these methods to investigate the vacuum polarization for different models . in one of these papers , the authors @xcite studied an exactly solvable model in which a fermion is coupled to a background field with two adjustable parameters . by varying these parameters",
    ", one can have different topological background fields with different topological charges and scale of variation . using this simple model",
    ", they were able to explore the effect of the scale of variations of the solitons on the vacuum polarization .    in the j - r model",
    "there is no explicit mass term for the fermi field and the zero mode is always present , regardless of the values of the parameters of the model .",
    "these parameters are the yukawa coupling constant , denoted by g , the values of the background field at spatial infinity , denoted by @xmath1 , and its slope at zero , denoted by @xmath3 . in a previous paper we presented exact solutions for the j - r model and showed explicitly that there is a dynamically generated mass @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we also reasoned that as @xmath1 increases and a mass gap appears in the spectrum , the two threshold bound states which separated the continua at @xmath9 , join to form the ever present self - charge - conjugate nondegenerate zero mode . in this paper",
    "we generalize the j - r model by adding an explicit mass term for the fermi field , denoted by @xmath10 , and solving the dynamical equations exactly , we find that the system possesses some unusual properties .",
    "in particular the potentials appearing in the two schrodinger - like equations obtained from decoupling the dirac equation have unequal values at @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we have , in addition to the usual bound and continuum states , reflecting continuum states .",
    "moreover , a schematic plot of the spectrum as a function of @xmath1 reveals an energy gap region in the form of a triangle where no bound states can exist .",
    "the end point of this region is a critical value @xmath12 .",
    "the zero mode is formed from the union of the threshold bound states present at this point and this zero mode exists for @xmath13 .",
    "for the j - r model @xmath14 .",
    "hence the vacuum polarization is zero for @xmath15 and @xmath7 for @xmath13 .    in section 2",
    "we define the massive j - r model which includes a massive fermion interacting with a prescribed background field in the form of the familiar kink .",
    "we then briefly discuss some important symmetries of our model which are the same as the original massless j - r model . in section 3",
    "we obtain the second order decoupled schrdinger - like equations obtained from the first order dirac equation .",
    "then , we solve these decoupled differential equations , analytically . depending on the range of energy , three kinds of states",
    "are possible for the fermion .",
    "we first find the bound states in subsection 3.1 .",
    "the second kind of states which we call reflecting continuum states are obtained in subsection 3.2 .",
    "the wave functions of these states vanish at @xmath16 , but are a superposition of an incident wave and a reflecting one with equal amplitude at @xmath17 .",
    "in subsection 3.3 we obtain and discuss the continuum scattering states .",
    "the wave functions of these states are oscillatory at both spatial infinities . in section 4",
    "we plot the allowed energies of the fermion as a function of the parameters of the kink i.e.@xmath1 and @xmath3 . in these graphs",
    "we plot the energy levels of the bound states and also show the region for the energies of the reflecting and scattering states .",
    "we observe that the zero mode in the massive j - r model is not always present and there is an energy gap in the form of a triangle in the @xmath1 graph in which no state is permitted . in section 5",
    "we summarize the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "consider a ( @xmath18)-dimensional model including a fermi field @xmath19 coupled to a pseudoscalar field @xmath20 , and defined by the following lagrangian @xmath21\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass of the free fermion , @xmath22 is a positive coupling constant , and @xmath23 is a prescribed background field in the form of @xmath24 which is the kink of the @xmath25 theory .",
    "notice that the lagrangian has an explicit fermion mass term and the mass of the fermion is nonzero even in the noninteracting case .",
    "however , the interaction term changes the mass of the fermion at the tree level .",
    "we can define two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are the value of the kink at spatial infinity ( @xmath28 ) and its slope at @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) , respectively .",
    "we choose the following representation for the dirac matrices : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this model possesses the charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "this operator relates the states with positive energy to the ones with negative energy as @xmath32 and a zero - energy fermionic mode , if it exists , is self charge conjugate , i.e.@xmath33 .",
    "one can easily check that this system also possesses the particle conjugation symmetry whose operation is @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , for every state with energy @xmath35 , there is a corresponding state with energy @xmath36 and the fermion spectrum is completely symmetric with respect to the line @xmath37 .",
    "this model is not invariant under the parity , since the background field is the kink which is an odd function in space .",
    "hence , this model does not preserve the cp and consequently it is not invariant under the time reversal .",
    "notice that all the symmetries of this massive model are the same as the massless one ( @xmath38 ) .    in the following section we solve the equations of this model exactly and find the whole spectrum of the fermion , including the bound and continuum states .",
    "the presence of the background filed can in general cause essential changes in the spectrum of the fermion . to find the spectrum of the fermion in our model",
    ", we solve the dirac equation of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath39 , the dirac equation in the presence of the background field @xmath23 is as follows @xmath40 this equation consists of two coupled first order differential equations . in order to find the fermion spectrum ,",
    "it is easier to first obtain the two decoupled second order equations obtained from eq.([eom ] ) .",
    "then , we can construct the solutions to the original dirac eq.([eom ] ) .",

    "also , all energies higher than @xmath48 are allowed . however , as we shall see , the continuum states with energies in the range @xmath49 are different from the continuum states with energies higher than @xmath50 . from now on we use the redefinitions @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for the brevity of the notation . applying these redefinitions , eq.([new2ndorder ] )",

    "here we present a very short derivation of the solutions mainly for the purpose of setting up our notation .",

    "solid and dashed lines show @xmath43 , respectively . for this figure",

    "therefore , the solution of eq.([subs ] ) can be written as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the hypergeometric function , and a and b are the expansion coefficients .",
    "these coefficients should be determined by the use of the asymptotic behavior and normalization of the wave functions .",
    "suppose that the energy @xmath108 is greater than @xmath109 but smaller than @xmath110 ( see fig.[potential ] ) .",
    "in this range the quantity @xmath111 is real but the quantity @xmath112 @xmath113 is imaginary ( see eqs.([aandb],[aandb2 ] ) ) .",
    "as we know , continuum states are possible in this range of energy . the wave functions of these states vanish when @xmath82 . however , they are oscillatory at @xmath114 . since when @xmath82 , the first solution in eq.([oursol ] ) behaves as @xmath115 , @xmath116 should be positive .",
    "however , the second solution in eq.([oursol ] ) does not have the proper behavior when @xmath82 and we should set again @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the wave functions of these solutions are as follows @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the normalization factors for these states",
    ". we can easily check that these wave functions satisfy eq.([eom ] ) if we set @xmath120 .",

    "now , we focus our attention on the states with energies greater than @xmath110 . in this range both the quantities",
    "@xmath125 and @xmath126 are imaginary .",
    "all the energies of this range are permitted and we have continuum states .",

    "these solutions satisfy eq.([eom ] ) , when @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "we can refer to this as a left - scattering process .",
    "analogously , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath138 ( eq.([scatt2 ] ) ) , shown in eq.([asympscatt2 ] ) , describes a right - scattering process .",
    "in this section we show the energies of the fermion in some graphs . in the left and right graphs of fig.[bnd1 ] we depict the bound state energies as a function of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "the free fermion in this model has no explicit mass term .",
    "therefore , there is no mass gap for the free dirac field and the two threshold half - bound states present for the free case in ( @xmath18 ) dimensions have both zero energy in j - r model .",

    "the zero - energy bound state exists only for @xmath147 and this is in sharp contrast to the original j - r model where the zero mode is always present , regardless of the values of the parameters of the model .",
    "consequently , the kink in the massive j - r model does not always polarize the vacuum and vacuum polarization jumps between the value zero and @xmath7 at @xmath148 .",
