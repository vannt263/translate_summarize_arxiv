    "in the context of soil consolidation , one can consider the problem of fluid  segregation .",

    "an extension of the classical biot theory has been formulated via a nonlinear poromechanical model within the framework of second gradient theories @xcite .",
    "this model is able to describe the occurrence of a second stationary state richer in fluid .",
    "thus , fluid  segregation is described by considering a kind of phase transition .    the model in @xcite",
    "is based on the introduction of a quartic energy potential , depending on the strain @xmath0 and the variation of the fluid mass density @xmath1 .",
    "this potential is an extension to that of biot @xcite and , beside the new fluid  rich phase , it provides the same biot s standard phase . the dissipation process which characterizes the dynamics of consolidation",
    "is described considering a pure darcy dissipation rather than a pure stokes dissipation .",
    "it is possible to prove that darcy dissipation implies the behavior of the porous system to be governed by a kind of cahn  hilliard set of partial differential equations ( pde ) , whilst pure stokes dissipation yields a kind of allen  cahn set of equations @xcite .",
    "the effect of the external world on the consolidating porous medium can be coded into the boundary conditions of the pde problem describing the evolution of the system .",
    "the main mathematical difference between the two pde cases is that the allen  cahn  like equation is a second  order pde , while the cahn  hilliard equation a fourth  order one .",
    "thus , in the latter case two additional boundary conditions have to be prescribed .    here",
    "we describe the effects of an impermeable wall on the consolidation process .",
    "the main appropriate equation in this context is the cahn ",
    "hilliard one ; in fact in this case we can prescribe boundary conditions on the chemical  potential or on its derivative ( seepage velocity ) , while in the allen ",
    "cahn case , being this choice impossible , the chemical potential is fixed to be zero in the boundaries , thus letting the fluid be free to flow .    in @xcite , as an extension to the model @xcite , the authors introduced an impermeable wall in one of the boundaries ; in order to obtain the fluid ",
    "segregation inside the porous medium , the fluid  poor and the fluid ",
    "rich phases at the boundaries of the medium itself were prescribed thanks to dirichlet boundary conditions .",

    "segregation dynamics is obtained by a prescription of the boundary values , a set of more realistic boundary conditions has to be taken into account . in the present work we discuss the effects of the impermeable wall by choosing a set of neumann homogenous boundary conditions .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the choice of these piecewise conditions is that it is straightforward to expect an accumulation of fluid in the neighborhood of the impermeable wall as the level @xmath180 grows ( with @xmath179 remaining fixed ) , so that the fluid could remain trapped into the porous medium , thus giving a dynamics towards a stationary solution of interface type . on the other hand , it is also possible that , if the fluid level @xmath180 is too high , also the dynamics without the impermeable wall can lead to a not constant stationary solution ( see figure [ dinamica1 ] and discussion below ) , so that it is important to study thoroughly the effects of the more ( or the less ) amount of fluid in the initial state , in order to obtain different final states for the dynamics with the two different natural boundary conditions .      in figures",
    "[ dinamica1 ] , [ dinamica2 ] and [ dinamica3 ] we report the evolution of the system starting from three different piecewise initial states . + the first condition , corresponding to case @xmath181 of table [ tabella1 ] , is an evolution for which the final state in both cases ( zero  chemical and one  side  impermeable problem ) is the same .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in figure [ dinamica1 ] , in both cases the motion is divided in two steps , the same as the evolutions studied in @xcite , i.e. the formation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 profiles and the slow motion towards the not costant ( interfaces ) stationary solutions .",
    "the main reason of the similar evolution in both cases is the fact that the amount of water of the initial state is very high ( see section above ) , so that the formation of the interfaces is a direct consequence .",
    "even if the final state of both the evolutions is the same , some differences can be observed in the first step of the evolutions . in the case without the impermeable wall , water can enter from the right boundary so that the formation of the profile is not only quicker but also more straightforward , as confirmed by the velocity profile , than the first step with the impermeable wall .",
    "in fact , in this last case , due to the presence of the wall , the fluid has to slowly accumulate in the neighborhood of the right boundary , giving rise to depression phenomena in the first moments of evolution ( see the first three rows of figure [ dinamica1 ] ) .",
    "+ the evolution depicted in figure [ dinamica2 ] corresponds to case @xmath182 of of table [ tabella1 ] . in this case , the dry portion of the medium being the same , the water level of the initial state is less with respect to case @xmath181 so that the evolution without an impermeable wall ends with the classical consolidation of a porous medium ( the fluid flows out completely ) and the final state is the standard poor  fluid state @xmath183 .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding evolution with an impermeable wall has a different beahvoiur , actually the same behaviour of the previous case @xmath181 and that of the the evolutions studied in @xcite .",
    "the way of fluid emptying in the zero  chemical potential evolution is first the accumulation of the initial state fluid in the center of the medium , thus giving rise to a double  interface  like profile ( as can be observed by the velocity profile ) , then the symmetric slow release of the fluid through the boundaries . regarding the evolution in the one  side ",
    "impermeable case , the first step of dynamics is slight different from that of figure [ dinamica1 ] ; in fact in this case , due to the less amount of water of the initial state , the depression phenomenon before the fluid accumulation in the neighborhood of the roght boundary is much more appreciable .",
    "+ finally we analyze the evolution of figure [ dinamica3 ] , which refers to case @xmath184 .",
    "the water level of the initial state is the same as that of case @xmath182 , but the dry portion of the medium is much less .",
    "the evolution with the impermeability is quite different in this case .",
    "in fact , the final state corresponds to the fourth case of figure [ figurastazionario1 ] , i.e. a double interface .",
    "the fluid amount of the initial state is not enough to produce a single  interface profile , but not so little to let all the water exit from the left boundary .",
    "the result is that the fluid remains trapped in the center of the medium instead of in its right part . in this case",
    ", the water depression is observed in the center of the porous medium .",
    "it is worth to note that the final velocity profile is the same of that of the cases studied in @xcite , but duplicated .",
    "+ in this case the evolution of the system without impermeable wall is quite similar to that of figure [ dinamica1 ] .",
    "the evolution depicted in figure [ dinamica4 ] represents the dynamics described by problems ( [ problema - d ] ) and ( [ problema - d - osi ] ) with the impermeabilty in @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 . the initial state is a piecewise function with a continuous junction between the fluid  poor @xmath183 and the fluid  rich phase @xmath185 . in this case , like those of figures [ dinamica2 ] and [ dinamica3 ] , the final state of the evolution is different with the different natural boundary conditions .",
    "the evolution with the impermeability condition is very similar to that of the the evolutions studied in @xcite , as can be seen by the final shape of the velocity profile in figure [ dinamica4 ] .",
    "the dynamics without the impermeable wall is just a process of fluid filling inside the medium so that , when the fluid  rich state is reached , the evolution ends and the velocity profile is identically zero .",
    "+ the reason for this behaviour is that , at the beginning , the medium is almost filled with the fluid and the possibility of flowing trough the left boundary quickly fills the whole bar with water while , in the case of impermeability , a water depression in the neighborhood , remaains as a feature of the whole evolution , thus leading to the formation of the interface , which is the most close solution to the initial state .",
    "+ the choice of this initial state is that of ( numerically ) investigating the occurence of different final states ( with different boundary conditions ) in the presence of a water depression in the neighborhood of the left boundary .",
    "+ with this choice we proved that , in the case of the one - side  impermeable problem , if the evolution starts with a water depression , due to the wall , the depression remains during the whole evolution .",
