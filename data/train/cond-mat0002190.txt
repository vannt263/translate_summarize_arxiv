    "josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) measurements in highly anisotropic layered superconductors @xcite probe directly the interlayer josephson coupling and the effect of pancake vortices on this coupling , because the squared jpr frequency , @xmath7 , in the most part of vortex phase diagram , is proportional to the average interlayer josephson energy @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the zero field plasma frequency , @xmath10 is the c - component of the london penetration depth , @xmath11 is dielectric constant , and @xmath12 is the josephson critical current .     near two misaligned pancakes.,width=278 ]    the jpr measurements performed in the liquid vortex phase at relatively high magnetic fields , @xmath13 , revealed that the plasma frequency drops approximately as @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the josephson length , @xmath16 is the anisotropy ratio and @xmath17 is the interlayer distance .",
    "the above dependence is characteristic for the pancake liquid weakly correlated along the @xmath18 axis.@xcite in this phase many pancake vortices contribute to the suppression of the phase difference at a given point .",
    "in contrast , in the vortex solid pancake vortices form aligned stacks and suppression of coupling is caused by weak misalignments of the pancake vortices due to the thermal fluctuations and random pinning .",
    "jpr measurements in bi@xmath19sr@xmath19cacu@xmath19o@xmath20 ( bi-2212 ) crystals @xcite have shown that the jpr frequency decreases approximately linearly with field in the vortex solid . in the fields above 20 oe",

    "the linear dependence was observed experimentally in refs .",
