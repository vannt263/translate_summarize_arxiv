    "chemical elements appear in the universe as a consequence of three main processes of production : the big - bang nucleosynthesis , the spallation process and the stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the first one only explains h and he and some traces of other light elements , while the second one transforms , by the collision of cosmic rays , some chemical elements in other lighter by the fragmentation of the weightier ones .",
    "the third one is actually the most important in forming the majority of elements of the universe .",
    "chemical evolution models are the classical tool to interpret observed elemental abundances , and associated quantities such as gas and stellar surface densities , star formation histories , and the distribution of stellar ages .",
    "elemental patterns carry the fingerprint of star formation timescales from their birth location , regardless of a star s present - day position .",
    "chemical evolution codes solve a system of first order integro - differential equations , assuming an analytical star formation ( sf ) law , an initial mass function ( imf ) , stellar lifetimes , and nucleosynthetic yields .    in ( * ?",
    "* hereafter md05 ) we calculated a grid of 440 theoretical galaxy models , applied to 44 different radial distributions of galaxy mass and with 10 different values between 0 and 1 for the molecular gas and star formation efficiencies , which implies 10 different evolutionary histories for each one of the different sizes / masses of galaxies .",
    "this grid was calibrated on the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) , by using the data of surface densities of hi , h@xmath0 , stars and sf rate ( sfr ) , and also of c , n , and o abundances , and with time evolution data for the solar region such as the metal - enrichment or the sfr histories .",
    "our model has the advantage over similar ones in the literature of assuming that stars form in two steps : first the molecular clouds form from the diffuse gas following a classical schmidt law , then cloud - cloud collisions lead to the formation of stars .",
    "therefore , we derive radial distributions for * both * gas phases in a galaxy .",
    "this allows a certain delay in the star formation , doing smoother star formation histories .",
    "results from that work show that , as expected , the sfr radial distributions follow those of the molecular gas ; however both showing a drop in the inner regions of the disks , at variance with observations .    in order to explore those differences further , we have started the computation of a new grid of models including updates to all the relevant ingredients as the stellar yields in @xcite , or the infall rate law in @xcite . in the present work , our aim is to improve the predicted @xmath1 and sfr radial profiles , while maintaining abundance radial gradients in agreement with those observed .",
    "for that we will study the changes in the molecular gas radial distributions when using different prescriptions existing in the literature about the formation of molecular clouds from the diffuse gas and select which of them is the best one to reproduce the existing observations on the mwg taken as the calibration galaxy .",
    "section 2 of this work presents some of these new prescriptions taken from @xcite , describing the different models we compute . in section 3",
    "we show our model results for the mwg , comparing them with recent observational data as given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we check if our results reproduce the universal radial profile h@xmath0/hi given by @xcite , analyzing the dependencies of this ratio on the galaxy morphological type and on the dynamical mass .",
    "finally , in section 5 we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we are going to summarize our basic multiphase chemical evolution model ( hereinafter mulchem ) and describe the different prescriptions used in this work , to be included in it , to form molecular clouds , h@xmath0 , from the diffuse gas , hi .      as described in @xcite , we start computing the radial mass distributions for 16 theoretical galaxies following @xcite equations , defined in terms of the virial mass of the dark matter haloes , @xmath2 , and their associated rotation curves for the galaxy disk and halo .",
    "the virial masses are in the range @xmath3$]m@xmath4 , with associated barionic disk masses in the range @xmath5$]m@xmath4 .",
    "the initial gas in each model collapses onto the disk on timescales based in the @xcite relationship , which gives the ratio between the galaxy disk and the dark matter halo masses , @xmath6 . from the rotation curves ,",
    "we calculate the radial distribution of the galaxy dynamical mass , @xmath7 as well as the predicted disk mass , @xmath8 , at the present time .",
    "thus , we obtain the infall rate necessary to produce , at the end of a given model evolution , the appropriate disk for each galaxy dynamical mass .",
    "these infall rates are defined by a collapse time scale @xmath9 given by these two accumulated masses distributions , @xmath7 an@xmath8 through the corresponding mass in each radial region , which we define as 1 kpc wide :    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12 \\label{eq_infall_rate}\\ ] ]    the infall rates inferred from expression  ( [ eq_infall_rate ] ) vary among different galaxies and among the different radial regions within them , and they imply a modest evolution with time of the infall rate for the disks but a strong evolution for bulges .",
    "the radial regions in a disk for a galaxy with @xmath13m@xmath4(i.e . , a mwg - like analog ) show present day infall rates of @xmath14m@xmath4yr@xmath15 for galactocentric radii @xmath16kpc , in agreement with @xcite s data , being much lower for the outer regions , @xmath17kpc , ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .    once defined our initial scenario with these radial distributions of masses , it is necessary to solve the equation system which solves the evolution along the time of each radial region located at a galactocentric distance r , in the halo and in the disk . in mulchem",
    "we solve the following system :    @xmath18    these equations predict the time evolution of the different phases of the model .",
    "more importantly , we consider in our model mulchem @xcite two phases of gas in the disk : diffuse gas , @xmath19 , and molecular gas , @xmath20 , which are well known to be essential ingredients in the process of star formation , but have only recently been explicitly included in other chemical evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to disk and halo , respectively .",
    "the infall rate , @xmath26 , is the inverse of the collapse time @xmath9 , given by the expression [ eq_infall_rate ] , and the death rates are computed with : @xmath27 being @xmath28 the mass limiting the low mass stars from intermediate mass and massive stars , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the lower and upper mass limits of the initial mass function @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the main sequence lifetime of a star of mass @xmath33 .",
    "as explained in md05 , in our model it is assumed that the star formation takes place following a schmidt law in the halo regions ; in the disk , however , it occurs in two steps : first molecular clouds , @xmath34 , form from diffuse gas , @xmath35 , then stars form through cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "besides , a second star formation process appears resulting from the interaction of massive stars , @xmath36 with the molecular clouds surrounding them .",
    "therefore , we have different processes defined in the galaxy :    1 .   star formation by spontaneous fragmentation of gas in the halo : @xmath37 , where we use @xmath38 2 .   disk formation by gas accretion from the halo or protogalaxy : @xmath39 3 .",
    "clouds formation by diffuse gas . in our standard models this process is @xmath40 .",

    "diffuse gas restitution due to the induced star formation : @xmath45 ,    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the proportionality factors of the star formation in the halo , the cloud formation , the cloud - cloud collision and the cloud - massive stars interactions ( last two create stars from molecular clouds ) , @xmath50 , @xmath25 and @xmath51 , used in our previous works to denote the parameters defining the star formation in the halo , the molecular clouds formation in the disk , the cloud - cloud collisions and the cloud - massive stars interactions , by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "since stars are divided in two groups , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , the parameters involving star formation are divided in the two groups too , thus : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , where terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 refer to the restitution of diffuse gas due to the cloud - cloud collisions and massive stars - cloud interaction processes .",
    "thus , the star formation law in halo and disk is : @xmath64    the factors @xmath46 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 have a radial dependence , as discussed in previous studies @xcite :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the halo and the disc volumes of each radial region , @xmath69 is the average cloud density and @xmath70 is the average mass of massive stars .",
    "thus , we converted these parameters in relationships with the volume and with other quantities that we called _ efficiencies _ , @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath55 , which represent probabilities ( in the range @xmath71 $ ] ) associated to the processes of conversion among the different phases and that we assume constant for all radial regions within a galaxy . the efficiency to form stars in the halo , @xmath56 ,",

    "we assumed that it is approximately constant for all halos .",
    "the last efficiency , @xmath55 , was also obtained from the best value @xmath73 for the mwg , and it is also assumed constant for all galaxies , since these interactions between clouds and massive stars are local processes .",
    "thus , we have only one free parameter : @xmath58 . in the present work we are going to modify the formation of h@xmath0 , keeping this efficiency @xmath58 as a free parameter with values in the range [ 01 ] as in md05 and @xcite .",

    "( 22 ) represents the mass of an element @xmath96 ejected by all stars of mass @xmath33 .",
    "this method allows to relax the hypothesis of solar proportions in the ejection , since each element @xmath96 relates with its own sources .",
    "it was originally introduced to compensate for the lack of stellar models of different metallicities , when the dependence on z was not included in the stellar yields calculations now that stellar yields for different metallicities are available , the use of @xmath92 matrices allows to us to take into account possible differences of chemical composition within a given z. stellar yields have usually been computed assuming only solar relative abundances among the different elements at a given z. however , the relative abundances of elements are not always solar nor constant along the evolutionary time . therefore ,",

    "the reason for this is that the same total mass is chosen for the six models and the infall rate is also the same for all of them ; simultaneously , the sfr is quite similar too .",
    "there are , however , important differences out of this galactocentric distance .",
    "this occurs because , at variance with our classical models std and mod in which the sfr begins at the initial time @xmath134 , the other four models require a threshold value for the total or stellar density or the metallicity to initiate the formation of molecular clouds and the subsequent sfr .",
    "in fact , we have added a threshold metallicity @xmath135 to the z term in gne , kru and asc models , to avoid the parameter @xmath47 to be always zero ( and the sfr too ) thus preventing any evolution .",
    "this threshold translates into an abrupt increase of @xmath47 in the last 4 models when the required conditions are reached and , simultaneously , a strong decrease of the star and gas surface densities in the outer regions of disks in different degrees , due to low densities or metallicities .",
    "panel a ) showing the diffuse gas surface density is where the largest differences arise among the different models .",
    "this is expected since they differ in the prescriptions to convert this diffuse gas into molecular gas . at any rate ,",
    "all of them show a flatter radial distribution than the other three panels , with asc showing the best agreement with data up to a galactocentric distance of 14 - 15kpc , while the others look slightly high , in the limit of the error bars .",
    "the radial distributions resulting from models kru , gne and asc , on the other hand , show a maximum just at @xmath136kpc , that we interpret as due to a strong decrease in the parameter @xmath47 and that can also be seen in the decreasing of the distributions in panels b ) , c ) and d ) . this way , outer than 15 - 16 kpc , bli shows a better agreement with data than asc and also better than kru , and gne .",
    "nevertheless , we should bear in mind that the large errors in the data corresponding to the outer regions do not allow to discriminate among the different models . in panel b ) , the comparison is clearer : all models behave basically in the same way within the optical disc . at face value ,",
    "bli and asc fit better the observations in the outer disk , while std and mod show values higher than expected , and kru and gne show a very steep decrease . in any case , it is again necessary to take into account the large error bars of these estimates . in c ) all models are plausible up to a galactocentric distance of 14 - 15kpc and differences arise out of this radius . as there are no data out of 16kpc any model seems valid . in panel d ) the data points lie between bli and asc models and std and mod . summarizing ,",
    "gne and kru yield the worst agreement with data , while bli and asc seem to provide the best one .    in fig .",

    "again we only see differences in the outer disk regions , as in panels b ) , c ) and d ) of the previous fig .",

    "bli is in between the two types . following o and n data , which arrive until 17 - 10kpc , the classical models std ad mod behave better than models using new prescriptions .",
    "however , c data shows a stepper radial gradient , mainly in he outer disk , more in agreement with models gne , bli , kru and asc . if the radial gradients are steeper or flatter in the outer disk is still a matter of discussion , but there are growing evidences that there exist an universal radial gradient ( when measured as function of a normalized radius ) which shows a flattening beyond 2r@xmath137 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) , which would fall around 1213kpc in mwg . if this is the case , the strong decrease of the radial distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ disk ] and fig .",
    "[ abun ] by models gne , kru and asc would be in total disagreement with observations , with only bli as marginally valid , and std and mod the only actually able to maintain a certain _ flattening _ although not totally enough .",
    "it is necessary to take into account , when analyzing these results , that all the new prescriptions , that is , gne , bli , kru and even asc models , have some parameters taken as constant which actually might be changed , thus modifying the results .",
    "thus , gne uses a parameter @xmath138 which we take as 1 , just because we are calculating a model for mwg .",
    "this parameter , however , could be slightly different along the galactocentric radius , since it depends basically on the ultraviolet stellar radiation at 1000 which , in turn , would change with the number of massive stars born in each time and region . with a lower value , @xmath139 , ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , a high value of @xmath140 may be reached at low densities of gas .",
    "therefore , the sfr will be higher , since it depends on the molecular gas , and also the stars ; simultaneously , a strong decrease of the diffuse gas will be produced .",
    "on the contrary , with a higher value , as @xmath141 , the molecular clouds and stars formation will decrease and , therefore , hi density will maintain high .",
    "using a parameter @xmath138 variable with radius would do possible to fit the outer regions of the galactic disk better than with a constant value .",
    "we have checked this idea with @xmath142 in @xmath143kpc and a straight line from @xmath144kpc and @xmath145 .",
    "we have seen that effectively the fit improves in the outer disk beyond 14kpc .",
    "it will be necessary to analyze carefully this subject and its consequences in a future work , after calculating the spectral energy distribution of each time and region , and the corresponding variation of the intensity of 1000 in order to include a more precise dependence on this parameter .",
    "similarly it occurs with other quantities included in the other prescriptions , as the local number density of dust grains in asc , calculated with a fiducial value @xmath146 while other authors use the half of this value @xcite , or the functions @xmath147 or @xmath148 included in kru , which are obtained through approximations and simplifications by using typical values of the number density , dust cross section , and h@xmath0 formation rate coefficient , to compute a value @xmath149 , which may also be different in other times or other radial regions of the mwg .",
    "these considerations do that the proportionality factors included in eq.(37 ) , ( 43 ) , ( 63 ) and ( 64 ) , might vary a factor between 2 and 5 .",

    "the fact that the radial gradient be the same when it is measured as a function of a normalized radius related with the stellar population existing in each time is reasonable , since stars are who produce the elements and eject them to the interstellar medium .",

    "although they divide their sample in two bins with disks and spheroids , respectively , and we use the ones for the disk galaxies , the effective radius is computed including the bulges , and , moreover , are biased towards massive early galaxies , and maybe for this reason their averaged effective radii are shorter than those we find for a mwg - like model ( whose stellar mass is within their data range ) .",
    "the use of the new prescriptions in models gne , bli , kru and asc produces disks more slowly than the use of a free parameter , as in models std and mod in which the formation of the disk occurs very quickly ( @xmath165 ) ; in gne and kru models this happens at @xmath166 and in asc and bli at @xmath167 . on the other hand , gne and kru cross at @xmath168 and gne also crosses with two other : asc and bli , at @xmath169 .",

    "clearly our old prescriptions as included in std and mod models are not as good as the new ones , since they produce very flat radial distributions , even increasing at the outer regions , in disagreement with the mwg data at face value ( although still within errors , which are quite large in these outer regions of the disc ) .",
    "they also differ in the observational trends shown in @xcite .",
    "models gne , bli , and kru have a better behavior , but actually only asc shows a shape closer to the correlations found by these authors .",
    "the same can be seen in the figures at the right panel . at variance with models",
    "std and mod using the old efficiency to form molecular clouds , models computed with the new prescriptions show an increase in the ratio @xmath174 with the stellar surface density",
    ". however , the slope of these relationships are smaller than the observed one , asc being the closest model to that line , although it does not present a straight line in the logarithmic scale but a curve .",

    "given the data for these regions , scarce for c , and reaching far for o , it is quite difficult to determine which of these models is the best one .",

    "the oxygen abundances show a similar slope in their disk distributions when only radial regions within @xmath177 are considered .",
    "it is necessary to take into account that the disk grows at a different rate in each model . in consequence",
    "the radial gradient of oxygen abundance measured within the optical disk is the same for all models and all redshifts , independently of the differences of grow existing among models ( fig .",

    "this point will need more detailed analysis in a future work .",

    "this implies that the asc method to compute the conversion between gas phases , including a dependence on the stellar and gas densities and on the global metallicity , seems to produce good results when compared to observational constraints .",
    "this model , however , produces a worst fit to the sfr at early times .",
    "furthermore , the n and o radial gradients seem to be better reproduced by the std and mod models at the outer disk . however , if we want to use a more realistic prescription to form molecular clouds than a free parameter , asc may be considered the best choice to be used in modern numerical chemical evolution models as well as in cosmological simulations .",
