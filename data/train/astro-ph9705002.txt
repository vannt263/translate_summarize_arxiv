    "the origin of structure in the universe is one of the most outstanding problems in modern cosmology . in the gravitational instability picture",
    "it is assumed that structures in the universe formed by gravitational growth of small density fluctuations seeded at some early epoch of the universe evolution .",
    "the cobe discovery of the microwave background anisotropies ( smoot et al 1992 , bennett et al 1996 ) proved convincingly that density fluctuations were already present at @xmath13 .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that these were indeed the seeds of the density field that were to lead to the present day structures . following the cobe discovery of the large - scale structure at @xmath14",
    "it is therefore even more imperative to try to reconstruct the pregalactic density field on scales and at epochs inaccessible to the microwave background measurements .",
    "the spectrum of the density field determines the epoch and the order of galaxy and structure formation .",
    "its normalization point is fixed by observations that show that fluctuations in the galaxy counts today at @xmath15 have unity amplitude on scale @xmath16mpc . given this amplitude at @xmath17 , or mass scale @xmath18 , and the slope of the spectrum",
    ", one can predict when and on what scales the first objects in the universe began to collapse .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "similarly , on scales @xmath19 where the density field is still in linear regime , the various properties of galaxy and cluster distribution can be used to determine the spectrum of the density field on scales currently inaccessible to space - borne microwave background measurements .    on theoretical level , the density field is assumed to have been seeded at some early epoch in the evolution of the universe .",
    "the most popular of such mechanisms involves inflationary cosmology with cold - dark - matter contributing most of the mass in the universe .",
    "various discussions have also concentrated on the density fluctuations seeded by topological defects , such as strings and textures , that can be produced naturally during early phase transitions .",
    "another possibility is the empirical approach , not necessarily motivated by the current ideas from high - energy physics , whereby one deduces the properties of the early universe from the present data , instead of  predicting \" what the present - day universe should be .",
    "the density field at some early time can be characterised by both its spatial and fourier components which are related via @xmath20 .",
    "if one assumes the density field to be a random variable , one can describe its statistical properties via the moments of its probability distribution .",
    "assuming an overall spherical symmetry the correlation function of the field is defined as the generalized scalar product @xmath21 .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as @xmath22 , where the average is performed over all phases .",
    "the correlation function and the power spectrum represent a pair of three dimensional fourier transforms .",
    "in addition the mean square fluctuation over a sphere of volume @xmath23 containing mass @xmath24 is related to @xmath2 via : @xmath25 . if the phases of @xmath26 are random , the distribution of the density field is gaussian , and the correlation function ( or its fourier transform ) uniquely describes all properties of the density distribution .",
    "the central theorem ensures that the gaussian distribution is reached in most inflationary mechanisms for generating energy - density fluctuations . in models with topological defects , however , the density field is not gaussian and , in addition to @xmath2 , it is determined by higher moments of the probability distribution .",
    "enough data have by now been accumulated over a large range of scales to strongly constrain the models , on the one hand , and on the other to attempt to determine the spectrum of the pregalactic density field independently of theoretical prejudices .",
    "this is the aim of this article where we analyse the various data to show that the data lead to a consistent and unique density field in the pregalactic universe .    when using the data derived from galaxy catalogs one determines the distribution of light , whereas in order to understand the physics of galaxy formation and early universe one needs to determine the distribution of mass .",
    "therefore , one has to introduce the biasing factor which determines how the two are related to each other .",
    "the most common assumption is that of linear basing , @xmath27 , although more complex and complicated biasing schemes can be considered .",
    "therefore , before we proceed to the main results of the paper we address the reliability of the general assumption of light - tracing - mass by comparing the velocity field predicted by the galaxy correlation function data with peculiar velocities in the great attractor region .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 we briefly define the cold - dark - matter models which we will test against the data in the paper and discuss the microwave background ( cobe dmr ) constraints on the very large scale part of the density field where it is likely that the power spectrum has preserved its original slope . in sec.3",
    "we analyse the data from the apm survey divided into narrow magnitude bins ( @xmath28 which contain galaxies at the same evolutionary stages . in this way we establish whether significant galaxy evolution effects could affect determination of the spectrum of the density field from the projected apm data . following this",
    ", we discuss the various fits to the apm data and conclude that they all give essentially the same field of light ( galaxy ) distribution on linear scales , @xmath29 .",
    "the data in the narrow magnitude bins , however , set somewhat stronger limits on cdm models than used before .",
    "in sec.4 we elaborate on a method to interrelate the data on the galaxy correlation function from both apm and cfa catalogs to that on peculiar velocities .",
    "this establishes if the light traces light and the constraints both datasets suggest for @xmath11 and the bias factor .",
    "thus we determine the spectrum of the pregalactic density field and its correlation function on scales ( 10 - 100)@xmath10mpc . in sec.5",
    "we calculate the amplification in the cluster correlation function due to gravitational clustering of density fluctuations .",
    "we then use the data on both the spatial slope of the cluster correlation function and on its richness - amplitude dependence in order to set further constraints on the cdm models .",
    "we devise a method to invert the richness - correlation amplitude dependence of clusters of galaxies in order to obtain directly the spectrum of the pregalactic density field on scales ( 5 - 20)@xmath10mpc .",
    "in sec.6 we provide comparison between the density field deduced independently from the apm catalog and from the cluster correlation data in order to constrain @xmath11 by requiring that the two match on the same scales . in sec.7",
    "we discuss the limits on the small - scale part of the pregalactic density field from the data on the existence and ages of high-@xmath12 galaxies and clusters .",
    "we also reconstruct the pregalactic density field from the data on the fundamental plane of modern - day ( elliptical ) galaxies , their absolute photometry and the dynamics of their haloes from the recent x - ray observations . at the end of this",
    ", we reconstruct in sec.8 the _ pregalactic _ density field over two decades in linear scale , @xmath30(1 - 100)@xmath10mpc .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 9 .",
    "because of its elegance and simplicity inflation is probably the most popular of the current theories for the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "the density field in inflationary picture originates from quantum energy fluctuations generated during the slow roll - over of the inflaton field during this era .",
    "exponential expansion of the underlying space - time during inflation ensures that the fluctuations are seeded by normal causal processes on scales well in excess of the current particle horizon of @xmath31mpc . in its simplest and most natural form inflation",
    "leads to gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations with the initial power spectrum which is scale - free and of the harrison - zeldovich slope , @xmath32 with @xmath5 . in conjunction with the cobe observations inflationary models generally require flat universe ( kashlinsky , tkachev and frieman 1994 ) while big bang nucleosynthesis implies a small baryon density ( pagel 1997 , walker et al 1991 ) . thus in order to reconcile inflationary prejudices with observations one has to postulate the existence of cold - dark - matter that was not directly coupled to the baryon - photon plasma in the prerecombination universe ( e.g. blumenthal et al 1984 and references cited therein )",
    ".    dynamical evolution of cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) in the early universe is well understood by now ( peebles 1982 , vittorio and silk 1985 , bond and efstathiou 1985 ) . in the cdm model",
    "one assumes that evolution during some early ( inflationary ) epoch resulted in adiabatic gaussian density fluctuations with _ initially _ scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "later the evolution of density fluctuations leads to modification of the power spectrum because of the different growth rates of sub- and super - horizon harmonics during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "thus in cdm models the power spectrum of the density field at the epoch of recombination is given by : @xmath33 the transfer function , @xmath34 , depends mainly on the size of the horizon scale at the matter - radiation equality , @xmath35 , and is @xmath36^{-1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath37mpc ( bardeen et al 1986 ) .",
    "on scales greater than the horizon scale at the matter - radiation equality , @xmath38mpc , the spectrum retains its original form and power slope index @xmath39 . on smaller scales",
    "it is modified in a unique , for given @xmath40 , way .",
    "the values of @xmath39 that are usually considered are @xmath41 , required by the simplest cdm model based on inflation",
    ". however , a case has been made also for a tilted cdm model with @xmath42 ( cen et al 1992 ) .    in models invoking topological defects , such as strings ,",
    "the evolution of the initial density field can also be calculated although with significantly more uncertainty because of the possible evolutionary modes of strings when they enter horizon ( albrecht and stebbins 1992 ) . in models which involve only baryonic matter",
    ", the primeval density fluctuations have to be purely isocurvature , and the evolution of the density field is further complicated by the possible reheating and reionisation effects after recombination ( e.g. peebles 1987 ) .",
    "in what follows we will distinguish between the  primordial spectrum \" and what we term the  pregalactic spectrum \" of the density field .",
    "by primordial we will mean the spectrum that was presumably produced during the very early stages of the universe s evolution and which is assumed to be self - similar and characterised only by its power slope index @xmath39 .",
    " pregalactic \" in the terminology of the paper will refer to the spectrum of the density field after recombination but prior to galaxy formation , e.g. at redshifts @xmath43 . in principle",
    ", the primordial spectrum can be recovered from the pregalactic one by assuming a transfer function .",
    "we will not do this , since it involves various uncertain assumptions , such as the nature of the dark matter , the type of density fluctuations , the values of cosmological parameters , assumptions about the degree and history of reionisation after recombination , etc .    in what follows",
    "we will aim to reconstruct the pregalactic density field in the universe from a variety of astronomical data , each dataset responsible for uncovering the spectrum of the density field over a certain range of scales . because of the theoretical appeal of the cdm models we will compare the results in each range of scales to the anzatz eqs .",
    "( 1),(2 ) predicted by inflationary cold - dark - matter models .    in all models of the early universe evolution , the density field on the largest scales which were always outside the horizon during radiation dominated era , @xmath44 a few hundred @xmath10mpc ,",
    "is expected to have preserved it initial , primordial , form .",
    "the spectrum of the density distribution on such scales is constrained by the cobe dmr data probing the microwave background anisotropies on angular scales @xmath45 . assuming a scale - free primordial power spectrum with adiabatic initial conditions , cobe dmr data ( smoot et al 1992 , bennett et al 1996 ) , after correcting for the galactic cut , imply a roughly power - law spectrum with @xmath46 at the 68% confidence level ( gorski et al 1996 ) .",
    "normalization to the cobe data also fixes the value of the bias parameter @xmath47 for a given power spectrum of the density field and @xmath11 ( kashlinsky 1992 ; efstathiou , bond and white 1992 ) .",
    "cdm models normalized to the cobe dmr data require @xmath48 ( e.g. stompor et al 1995 ) .    on smaller scales the pregalactic density field can be constrained and , as we show below , determined from the astronomical data out to @xmath12 of a few . in the remainder of this article we recover the pregalactic density field from the various datasets on the present - day universe .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction the two - point galaxy correlation function , @xmath2 , and the power spectrum represent a pair of three - dimensional fourier transforms and , for gaussian density fluctuations , define all properties of the density field .",
    "they are related via : @xmath50 measurements of the two - point correlation function from galaxy catalogs show that on small scales @xmath2 is very close to a power law @xmath51 , where @xmath52mpc and @xmath53 ( groth and peebles 1977 ) .",
    "this in turn means that the rms fluctuation in galaxy counts @xmath54 is unity on scale @xmath55mpc ( davis and peebles 1983 ) . here",
    "@xmath56 is the @xmath39-th order spherical bessel function and @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "( 4 ) also defines the connection between the  counts - in - cells \" analysis used in some galaxy surveys ( e.g. saunders et al 1991 ) and the underlying power spectrum or the 2-point correlation function , @xmath2 .",
    "the data on the correlation function on larger scales are now available from the apm catalog measurements ( maddox et al 1990 , hereafter mesl ) .",
    "the apm survey contains about 2.5 million galaxies in the blue magnitude range @xmath58 .",
    "mesl measured the 2-point angular correlation , @xmath1 , down to a systematic error of @xmath59 , remaining due to plate - to - plate gradients .",
    "these data are consistent with a variety of measurements of @xmath60 from measurements at other bands ( picard 1991 ) , catalogs ( collins , nichol and lumdsen 1992 ) and counts in cells analysis of iras galaxies ( saunders et al 1991 ) .",
    "these measurements of @xmath1 probe @xmath2 to considerably larger scales than the non - linear scales of @xmath61 .",
    "if galaxy distribution along the line of sight is known one can relate @xmath1 to the 3-dimensional correlation function , @xmath2 , via the limber equation ( limber 1953 ; peebles 1980 ) .",
    "its relativistic form is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the proper length , @xmath64 is the co - moving distance to @xmath12 , @xmath65 accounts for the fraction of galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 .",
    "the number of galaxies per @xmath68 with apparent magnitude @xmath69 is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the galaxy luminosity function at redshift @xmath12 and @xmath74 is the absolute luminosity of galaxy with apparent magnitude @xmath75 at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "eq.(5 ) can be rewritten to relate @xmath1 directly to the power spectrum ( kashlinsky 1991a ; peacock 1991 ) .",
    "substituting ( 3 ) into ( 5 ) and using that @xmath76 leads to : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the zero - order cylindrical bessel function . note that deducing the 3-dimensional power spectrum from the projected galaxy angular correlation function is independent of the distortions caused by peculiar velocities in the distribution of galaxies mapped in the redshift space ( kaiser 1987 ) . throughout the paper",
    "we will deal mostly with the shape of the power spectrum , rather than its amplitude .",
    "hence we chose to normalize eq.(7 ) by introducing in the denominator the explicit expression , eq.(4 ) , for unity galaxy counts over a sphere of radius @xmath17 .",
    "as eqs.(3),(5),(7 ) show a power law for @xmath79 implies a power law behaviour for @xmath80 or power spectrum @xmath81 .",
    "the apm survey represents the most accurate and biggest dataset for determining the correlation function galaxies . on small scales",
    "the projected angular correlation behaves like a power law @xmath82 with slope @xmath53 . on larger scales",
    "@xmath1 falls off sharply and eventually becomes lost in the systematic errors dominated by the plate to plate gradients of the apm catalog , @xmath83 .",
    "the falloff clearly implies the rollover in @xmath84 at large scales , or small @xmath85 .",
    "the apm catalog contains galaxies down to the limiting blue magnitude of @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath87 .",
    "thus in order to interpret the data on @xmath1 in terms of the power spectrum today ( or at any other coeval epoch ) one must eliminate or reduce the possible effects related to evolutionary uncertainties of the luminosity function , k - correction , and galaxy clustering .",
    "various fits have been suggested for the power spectrum to describe the apm data .",
    "kashlinsky ( 1992a ; hereafter k92 ) suggested an empirical fit to the power spectrum to describe the data : on small scales @xmath81 to reproduce @xmath82 at small angles . on large scales , or @xmath88 ,",
    "the power spectrum was assumed to go into the harrison - zeldovich regime consistent with the cobe dmr data .",
    "k92 used the apm data divided into six narrow magnitude of @xmath89 .",
    "this way one can reduce effects of evolution since such narrow slices are more likely to contain galaxies at similar depths . approximating the selection function like that of the lick catalog ( groth and peebles 1974 ; peacock 1991 ) k92 found that satisfactory fits to the apm data can be obtained for @xmath90mpc .",
    "baugh and efstathiou ( 1993 - hereafter be93 ) have developed an iterative deprojection technique using the lucy method ( lucy 1974 ) .",
    "they approximated the galaxy selection analytically and assumed that the time evolution of the power spectrum is scale independent .",
    "be93 then applied the method to invert @xmath1 from the entire apm dataset of @xmath58 . the resultant three dimensional power spectrum with the error bars from the method and the apm data uncertainties is plotted in fig.7 of be93 .",
    "application of their method to the two - dimensional power spectrum from the entire apm dataset led to similar numbers for @xmath84 ( baugh and efstathiou 1994 ) .    in terms of cdm models ,",
    "the apm data require significantly more large - scale power than predicted by the standard cdm model with @xmath91 ( mesl ) .",
    "various suggestions have been made to account for the observed excess of large scale power on scales where the present - day density field is still linear , @xmath92 .",
    "efstathiou et al ( 1990 ) have noted that the required large - scale power can be reproduced by low-@xmath11 cdm models in which case a non - vanishing cosmological constant would be required to keep the universe flat in accordance with the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "cen et al ( 1992 ) suggested that the excess power can be explained by the so - called tilted cdm model with @xmath930.7 - 0.8 .",
    "either of these modifications , decreasing @xmath11 or introducing @xmath94 , would boost the large - scale power of the cdm models on scales which are in the linear regime today .",
    "( at the same time this would , however , suppress the small scale power in such models ; implications of this are discussed later in the paper ) .",
    "we now turn to quantifying how good the above fits and models for @xmath84 are viz - a - viz the various evolutionary corrections that can affect the accuracy of the various interpretations .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function will affect the selection function of the limber equation , while evolution of spectral energy distribution will determine which galaxies appear in the b - band at @xmath15 . finally , the rate of the evolution of clustering pattern will introduce another redshift - dependent factor in the integrand of the numerator of ( 7 ) .",
    "in addition , eq.(7 ) contains a dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "mesl presented their data in two ways : 1 ) the entire sample of 2.5 million galaxies with @xmath95 magnitudes between 17.5 and 20.5 , and 2 ) the data for sub - samples of galaxies binned in 6 narrow magnitude slices of @xmath89 . in the first dataset , which was used in be93 , the galaxies are at very different depths and possibly very different evolutionary stages .",
    "the second apm dataset used in k92 is more immune from effects of evolution since it is more likely to separate galaxies at different depths and any evolution can be more readily uncovered and corrected for .",
    "we thus consider the apm data on @xmath1 for the six slices each @xmath89 in width .",
    "fig.1 plots the selection function , @xmath96 , for the six slices with @xmath97 of the apm survey from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "the luminosity function in eq.(6 ) was adopted from loveday et al ( 1992 ) : i.e. the schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function with @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the relativistic @xmath103 correction was modelled as @xmath104 with @xmath105 which adequately describes galactic spectra in the visible bands ( cf . yoshii and takahara 1988 ) .",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath106 and dotted to @xmath107 and no evolution was assumed .",
    "one can see that there is little dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , there would be little change for other plausible values of @xmath108 .",
    "the nearest slice of the apm galaxies contains galaxies typically lying at @xmath109 and the farthest slice contains galaxies at @xmath110 , so certain amount of evolution could have occurred .",
    "there is no overlap at the fwhm level between galaxies in the nearest and most remote slices , although certain overlap exists between galaxies in the nearby slices .",
    "on co - moving scales less than @xmath17 the present day density fluctuations are non - linear and the clustering pattern has been strongly distorted by gravitational evolution ( e.g. davis et al 1985 ) .",
    "on larger scales the density field is still in the linear regime and the clustering pattern there is likely to have preserved the original power spectrum of the density field .",
    "we use the small scales , @xmath111 , where the power spectrum is well known and its evolution with @xmath12 better understood , to constrain the possible evolutionary effects that can plague the apm data interpretation .    as @xmath112 the apm two - point correlation function is approximated well by a pure power law . at the same time , for small angular separations , the contribution to eq.(5 ) from @xmath2 at large separations becomes negligibly small .",
    "thus in the limit of small angular separations the 3-dimensional two - point correlation function at @xmath15 can be taken from the lick catalog to be @xmath113 with @xmath114mpc .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath2 can be modelled in the very non - linear regime as @xmath115 .",
    "two extremes of clustering evolution are generally considered for very small scales ( peebles 1980 ) : if clustering is stable in co - moving coordinates @xmath116 ; if it is stable in proper coordinates @xmath117 .",
    "thus for small scales the evolutionary effects must be constrained to match the apm data for all six slices : @xmath118 .",
    "substituting @xmath119 into ( 5 ) leads to : @xmath120^\\gamma \\psi^2(z ) ( 1+z)^2 \\sqrt{1+\\omega z } dz\\ ] ] comparison between ( 8) and the amplitude measured in the apm data provides an integral constraint on the amount of possible evolution .",
    "fig.2 plots the data from the apm survey ( mesl ) divided into 6 narrow magnitude bins .",
    "the magnitude limits for each bin are shown on the top of each box .",
    "the data is plotted with open triangles .",
    "the power - law fits corresponding to @xmath121 are plotted with two sets of straight lines .",
    "dashed lines are for @xmath107 and dotted are for @xmath106 and @xmath72 .",
    "the two lines of each type correspond to clustering pattern stable in co - moving ( lower lines ) and proper coordinates .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath122 are shown for @xmath105 .",
    "one can see that no - evolution models describe the low - angle behaviour of @xmath1 extremely well .",
    "the dependence on @xmath11 can be neglected and the dependence on the precise rate of the evolution of clustering pattern is also small . for clarity of the figure",
    "we do not show the lines for other values of @xmath103 , but note that the change is very small .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath103 would move the lines a little up , decreasing it to @xmath123 would make them lie exactly on top of the data at small angular scales . similarly , making the clustering pattern evolve a little faster than @xmath124 , as is suggested by simulations of non - linear gravitational clustering ( melott 1992 ) would shift the lines even closer to the data points . thus we conclude that the apm data are consistent with no or little evolution out to the epochs accessible to the apm magnitude limit of @xmath99 .",
    "the slight excess in the computed amplitude @xmath122 can be easily reduced to zero by adopting a slightly lower value of @xmath103 or requiring the the clustering pattern to evolve faster than @xmath116 .",
    "the first of these is quite reasonable given the evolution of stellar populations in the relevant bands ( e.g. bruzual 1983 ) .",
    "the second could be required if mergers play significant role in the evolution of clustering on non - linear scales ( melott 1992 ) ; this may even be suggested by the deep galaxy counts data ( broadhurst et al 1992 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that luminosity evolution plays a minor role out to @xmath125 for the standard population of blue galaxies with @xmath126 .",
    "the no - evolution models with non - linear clustering stable in co - moving coordinates can be used sufficiently accurately in interpreting the apm data on @xmath1 in terms of the underlying power spectrum of galaxy distribution .",
    "thin solid lines in fig.2 show the be93 fits to the six slices of the apm data assuming no luminosity evolution and with the luminosity function adopted from loveday et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "the three lines correspond to the best determined @xmath84 of be93 and to one standard deviation uncertainty .",
    "the clustering pattern was assumed to be stable in co - moving coordinates on all scales .",
    "the be93 power spectrum fits well the data at the various depths .",
    "it under - predicts the power on large scales by a small margin for the most distant of the apm slices .",
    "this , however , can be accounted for by assuming that the power spectrum on linear scales evolves less rapidly with redshift than the @xmath127 adopted from the non - linear scales .",
    "indeed , linear scales should evolve differently in accordance with the growth predictions in linear regime . in principle , one can try to reproduce the consistent evolution of the power spectrum on all scales following the prescription of hamilton et al ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how well such fits work for arbitrary cosmologies and ( non - power - law ) power spectra ( cf .",
    "peacock and dodds 1994 ) .",
    "the fit of be93 power spectrum to the apm data is good and we adopt it as a reasonable approximation to the power spectrum of galaxy distribution .",
    "the k92 fit is essentially the same as shown in fig.1 of the k92 paper and for brevity and clarity we do not show this set of lines in fig.2 , other than to point out that the be93 power spectrum fits the apm data much better than the earlier k92 empirical fit .    the k92 and be93 power spectra fit the clustering hierarchy today over both linear and non - linear scales . on linear scales",
    "the power spectrum today should reflect initial conditions , but on scales less than @xmath17 the initial power spectrum was distorted by gravitational effects .",
    "cdm models predict power spectrum only in the linear regime so it makes little sense to plot them in the already condensed fig.2 . in order to constrain cdm models from the binned apm data we proceed as follows :",
    "the apm data is accurate for @xmath128 and the small angular scales analysis suggested that evolutionary effects are small for scales and depths probed by the apm survey .",
    "the largest angular scales , where @xmath1 can still be probed , are dominated by contributions from linear scales , @xmath129 , and the data should be reproduced by eqs.(1),(2 ) within the framework of cdm models .",
    "thus for a given cdm model specified by @xmath39 and @xmath40 we computed the angular scale , @xmath130 , on which the predicted angular correlation function drops to the value @xmath131 .",
    "fig.3 plots the resultant @xmath130 vs the mean magnitude , @xmath95 , of the slices in fig.2 for the apm data and for predictions of the standard ( @xmath5 , upper boxes ) and tilted ( @xmath7 , lower boxes ) cdm models .",
    "the left boxes are for @xmath132 , which is just above the systematic error of @xmath133 induced by the plate - to - plate gradients in the apm survey .",
    "the right boxes are for @xmath134 which is significantly larger than @xmath135 and should be quite accurate .",
    "the thick plus signs show the values of @xmath130 derived from the apm data .",
    "cdm models are shown with the other signs : x s correspond to @xmath136 , squares to @xmath6 , triangles to @xmath4 , rhombs by @xmath137 and asterisks to @xmath138 .    as was mentioned the values of @xmath139",
    "are more reliable , but there is general agreement between the cdm fits to angular scales at both values of @xmath131 .",
    "there is also consistency between the fits for various slices or depths .",
    "the fits in fig.3 show that the linear part of the apm data can be described by cdm models which would then require @xmath4 if @xmath5 or @xmath6 if @xmath7 . increasing @xmath39 above 0.7",
    "would require even lower values of @xmath40 .",
    "the limit on @xmath40 required by cdm models for @xmath5 is in good agreement with what was claimed before ( efstathiou et al 1990 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the limits on the power parameter @xmath40 for the cdm models come from the nearby slices .",
    "the differences in the values of @xmath139 between cdm models of different @xmath40 are most profound for the nearest ( and least affected by any evolution ) slices . for the first three slices the apm data ( pluses ) would overlap with cdm predictions only for @xmath4 if @xmath5 and for @xmath6 if @xmath7 ; cdm models with both smaller and larger @xmath40 would predict values of the angular scale @xmath130 where @xmath140 different from what is observed .",
    "the limit on @xmath40 ( = 0.3 ) for the tilted model is significantly lower than what was suggested before in cen et al ( 1992 ) who used the entire apm galaxies lumped together and then scaled to the depth of the lick catalog .",
    "thus even if the primordial @xmath39 were as low as 0.7 one would still require low @xmath11 to fit the apm data with the cdm power spectrum .",
    "strictly speaking , the above discussion applies only to the distribution of light ( galaxies ) . in order to relate the power spectrum of galaxy distribution to that of mass one",
    "has to make assumptions about biasing or whether and how the light traces mass .",
    "the most economical and commonly made assumption to make is that of linear biasing ( kaiser 1984 ) , i.e. that light traces mass at least to within a scale - independent constant .",
    "we followed this assumption in this section , but it must be remembered that the plots in figs.2,3 refer to the distribution of luminous matter only .",
    "the next section discusses this assumption in more detail and there we propose an empirical justification for it based on comparing the density field of the apm survey to that probed by the velocity data .    assuming that light indeed traces mass , information on the initial ( pregalactic ) power spectrum in present - day galaxy catalogs is preserved only on scales where the density field is still in the linear regime , @xmath129 .",
    "thus fig.4 plots the r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuation , @xmath141 , over a sphere containing mass @xmath24 vs the co - moving scale this mass subtends for the spectra required by the apm data .",

    "fluctuation over a sphere of radius @xmath17 , and the numbers are shown for @xmath3mpc where the galaxy density field is still in the linear regime .",
    "this ratio is used because in linear regime it is roughly epoch independent and also because for linear biasing the quantity @xmath143 recovered from the apm data is independent of the ( constant ) biasing factor @xmath47 .",
    "solid lines are the k92 power spectra with the transition scale @xmath144mpc from bottom up . dashed lines correspond to the be93 power spectrum with three lines showing the mean and @xmath145 one standard deviation uncertainty .",
    "the cdm models that fit the apm data in six narrow magnitude slices are shown with thick dashed lines : @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "( the two models would essentially overlap over the range of scales plotted in fig.4 ) .",
    "the various fits to the data practically overlap on scales @xmath148mpc . on larger scales the be93 spectrum , which fits the apm data best , gives the least amount of large - scale power . within the uncertainty of the methods the cdm models required by the apm data reproduce roughly the same @xmath143 ratio as the be93 spectrum on scales @xmath149mpc .    _",
    "the quantity @xmath143 plotted in fig.4 is independent of the bias factor provided the latter is scale - independent .",
    "it also measures the spectrum of the density field in linear regime and is approximately independent of the redshift at which it is evaluated .",
    "these are the main reasons why in this paper we choose to reconstruct this quantity from various datasets . _    to conclude this section : 1 ) by analysing apm catalog data in narrow magnitude slices it was demonstrated that evolutionary effects are unlikely to affect interpretation of the apm data .",
    "2 ) the power spectrum derived by be93 provides a good fit to the apm data at all depths .",
    "3 ) assuming that light traces mass , the apm data can be fit at all depths by the standard cdm models with @xmath5 if @xmath150 .",
    "4 ) tilted cdm models will require @xmath151 if @xmath7 and lower values if @xmath39 is increased .",
    "5 ) in any case , all the above fits give practically identical numbers for @xmath143 on linear scales @xmath148mpc .",
    "this quantity measures density field in the linear regime and is approximately redshift independent .",
    "if the possible bias factor is scale independent the quantity @xmath143 determined from the apm data is independent of the bias factor .",
    "6 ) fig.4 demonstrates consistency of this approach and we conclude that , provided that light - traces - mass , the pregalactic density field on these scales is close to that drawn in the figure .",
    "the previous section established the power spectrum of galaxy distribution on scales @xmath152(60 - 100)@xmath10mpc . in order to reliably identify it with the spectrum of the pregalactic density field one",
    "has to establish the relation between the light and mass distributions .",
    "furthermore , as was discussed in the framework of the cdm models apm data would require a low @xmath11 universe .",
    "an independent test of these findings and assumptions can be provided by inter - comparison between the observed properties of peculiar velocity and density fields ( kashlinsky 1992b , 1994 ) .",
    "we address these questions in the section .",
    "measurements of peculiar velocities provide one with direct probe of the mass distribution in the universe and thus set strong limits on the large - scale structure models ( e.g. vittorio , juszkiewicz and davis 1987 ) .",
    "recent advances with the new distance indicators ( djorgovski and davis 1987 ; dressler et al 1987a ) allowed one to measure the peculiar flows in the local part of the universe up to @xmath153mpc ( see strauss and willick 1995 for a review ) . the results from using the fundamental plane properties of elliptical galaxies ( dressler et al 1987b ) suggest a large coherence length and amplitude of the local peculiar velocity field .",
    "the results from analysis of 1,355 spirals using the tully - fisher relation to determine distances ( mathewson et al 1992 ) would lead to an even larger coherence length and a similar amplitude .",
    "other samples are also in agreement with the great attractor findings ( e.g. willick 1990 ) . in a more controversial finding postman and lauer ( 1995 ) find from analysis of clusters of galaxies that the peculiar flows can be coherent over a much larger scale than the great attractor findings .",
    "all the results indicate significant deviations from the hubble flow with a large coherence length .    since peculiar velocities probe the mass distribution and also depend on the density parameter @xmath11 one can determine the latter by comparing the mass distribution implied by the velocity field with the observed distribution of galaxies .",
    "the density parameter is thus determined to within the uncertainty of the bias factor @xmath47 by determining the factor @xmath154 .",
    "there are various ways to use this information to get at @xmath11 .",
    "bertschinger and dekel ( 1989 ) developed potent method whereby the mass distribution is reconstructed by using the analog of the bernoulli equation for irrotational flows .",
    "they used the method to analyse in great detail and accuracy the peculiar velocity field out to about 60@xmath10mpc ( bertschinger et al 1990 ) . in dekel",
    "et al ( 1993 ) they compared the previously determined velocity field with the observed distribution of galaxies and concluded that the best fit is achieved with @xmath155 .    a different method was presented by kashlinsky ( 1992b ) and was based on comparing the velocity correlation function with the galaxy correlation function from the apm catalog ; this led to low values of @xmath1560.2 - 0.3 .",
    "herebelow we present a more detailed analysis based on the latter scheme and show that the results are indeed suggestive of low values of the density parameter .",
    "we also show that the results are in agreement with the scale independent bias factor .",
    "we define the dot velocity correlation function @xmath157 ( vittorio , juszkiewicz and davis 1987 , peebles 1987 ) .",
    "@xmath158 since gravity force is conservative , the flow caused by it must be irrotational . for irrotational flow the @xmath85-th component of the fourier transform of the peculiar velocity field is @xmath159 where @xmath160 . for the case of zero cosmological constant @xmath161 .",
    "if the cosmological constant , @xmath162 , is not zero @xmath163 will be different , but for the most interesting case of @xmath164 the above approximation would work very well ( lahav et al 1991 ) .",
    "eqs ( 3),(9),(10 ) are also valid for the filtered fields in which case both @xmath165 and @xmath2 must be replaced with their filtered versions .    assuming that light traces mass to within a constant bias factor , @xmath47 , substituting @xmath166 into ( 9 ) , and then taking laplacian operator of both sides would lead to : @xmath167 where it was used @xmath168 along with eq.(3 ) .",
    "this equation was evaluated independently in kashlinsky ( 1992b ) and juszkiewicz and yahil ( 1989 ) and it can be used to relate the on both peculiar velocity field and galaxy correlation function to get @xmath154 ( kashlinsky 1992b,1994 ) .",
    "the advantage of using ( 10 ) rather than the power spectrum data in conjunction with ( 9 ) ( e.g. kaiser 1983 ) is that eq.(10 ) can be integrated to contain only the scales over which the _ data _ on both @xmath2 and @xmath165 are known , while in the former case assumptions have to be made about the power spectrum over the wavelengths inaccessible to observations ( vittorio et al 1987 ) .",

    "only one of the constants of integration remains in ( 11 ) , the other constant of integration vanishes because the velocity field must be finite at @xmath171 .",
    "the constant of integration remaining in ( 11 ) is just the  central \" velocity dispersion , @xmath172 .    strictly speaking in order to use eq.(10 ) the data on both @xmath165 and @xmath2",

    "we ask now the following question : given the _ measurement _ of @xmath165 on some scale what should one expect to find for @xmath182 given the _ data _ on @xmath2 ?",

    "kashlinsky ( 1987,1991b ) proposed that one can combine kaiser s original suggestion with gravitational clustering theory ( press and schechter 1974 ) to explain both the amplification and its correlation with the cluster richness .",
    "he supposed that structure formation in the universe forms via a  natural bias \" ( cf .",
    "davis et al 1985 ) , i.e. systems of galaxies ( clusters and groups ) should be identified with regions that had turn - around time time less than the age of the universe .",
    "the model successfully explained the correlation between the cluster correlation function and richness ( mass ) with objects that turned - around on a larger scale having a greater correlation amplitude .    within the gravitational clustering model the properties of the hierarchy",
    "would then depend uniquely upon the power spectrum and the mass of the objects that formed / turned - around . in this section",
    "we first evaluate in greater detail the predicted properties of the cluster correlation function according to the gravitational clustering picture ( kashlinsky 1987 , 1991b ) and then apply the results to invert the data on cluster correlation function to obtain the spectrum of the density field on scales @xmath222mpc .",
    "we start with the density field at some initial epoch , @xmath223 , when density fluctuations were linear on all scales of interest .",

    "e.g. at a given number of standard deviations for gaussian models , such as cdm , collapsed objects would be less abundant than in models with non - gaussian density field such as strings ( cf .",
    "mahonen et al 1995 ) . a different argument about galaxy formation epoch",
    "is required in order to estimate the small - scale pregalactic density field directly .",
    "we now move to estimating the epoch of galaxy formation from the galaxies and then estimating the density field from which they formed directly .",

    "white and rees 1978 ) .",
    "we assume further that the forming halo turns - around at radius @xmath444 with little kinetic energy , i.e. its total energy per unit mass is @xmath445 .",
    "the ensuing cold collapse will lead to violent relaxation during which the time - dependent gravitational potential redistributes energy and particle distribution ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , while the total mass of the halo remains conserved .",
    "thus at the end of the violent relaxation the kinetic energy , @xmath446 , and potential energy , @xmath23 , will be related by the virial equilibrium relation : @xmath447 .",

    "therefore for halo that has one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath449 and , at least initially , had total mass @xmath24 ( which later could have been lost by e.g. tidal stripping ) the redshift of its turn - around is given by : @xmath454^\\third ( 1+z_{ta})\\ ] ] or in terms of numbers : @xmath455^\\third ( 1+z_{ta } ) = 13.3 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{200 { \\rm km / sec}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{m}{10^{12}h^{-1}m_\\odot}\\right)^{-2/3}\\ ] ] once the redshift of the halo turn - around has been evaluated one can calculate the redshift of its collapse , @xmath456 , by assuming the collapse to have taken twice the turn - around time ( e.g. gott and rees 1975 ) . as expected , at a given @xmath449 the low mass haloes should have collapsed at higher redshifts .",

    "we will thus be restricted to elliptical galaxies , but we will assume that the results are representative of the entire galaxy population .",
    "the fundamental plane relations of ellipticals are equivalent to the mass - to - light ratio of stellar populations of ellipticals scaling @xmath472 . from a detailed study of 37 ellipticals by van der marel ( 1991 )",
    "we adopt @xmath473 .",
    "assuming further that the ratio of the dark - to - luminous matter is constant throughout the universe and that luminous parts of galaxies formed by gas dissipation inside formed haloes ( white and rees 1978 ) would allow to relate the total ( initial ) mass of formed haloes to the blue luminosity of the present day galaxies .",
    "( by  initial \" we mean the mass at the time of the halo collapse ; clustering processes would have later stripped parts , or all , of the halo material to form a continuous dark matter distribution of clusters and groups of galaxies . )",
    "thus the mass of the halo at the time of its collapse is assumed to be given by : @xmath474 the @xmath475-function factors in ( 39 ) come from requiring that @xmath476 with @xmath477    observationally it is known that inner parts of elliptical galaxies are dominated by both stellar and halo potentials ( e.g. rix et al 1997 ) which would be consistent with ellipticals forming by dissipational collapse ( kashlinsky 1982 ) .",
    "thus central velocity dispersions of elliptical galaxies would not provide a good measurement of the halo potential well .",
    "the latter can be determined from dynamics in the outer parts of elliptical galaxies , where the only available measurements today come from x - ray data from hot gas coronae .",
    "the best measurements of temperature electron density profiles around ellipticals come from asca ( matsumoto et al 1997 , matsushita 1997 ) and rosat ( davis and white 1996 ) satellites .",
    "since the cooling time of the gas is of the order of @xmath478 the gas is likely to be hydrostatic .",

    "we show that by using the data on the underlying galaxy correlation function , @xmath2 at some fixed @xmath186 ( we chose @xmath313mpc ) , enables one to invert the amplitude - richness data to obtain the values of the rms fluctuations , @xmath143 , for the _ pregalactic density field _ on cluster mass - scales .",
    "applying the method to the data we obtain the pregalactic density field whose slope is in excellent agreement with the apm field on the same scales . requiring then that the two amplitudes coincide fixes @xmath11 to be 0.3 independently of the bias factor ; the same value that is implied by the dynamics of the coma cluster .",
    "\\4 ) we then use the data on objects at high redshift to constrain the small - scale part of the pregalactic density field .",
    "we argue that data on the existence of clusters of galaxies at redshifts @xmath525(1 - 2 ) , observations of galaxies at @xmath385 and the recent determination of galaxy ages from keck observations for a number of high-@xmath12 galaxies imply more power on small scales than predicted in cdm models normalized to the large - scale galaxy correlation data .",
    "we then reconstruct the pregalactic density field out of which modern - day ( elliptical ) galaxies have formed . to do this we use the data on blue absolute luminosities of faber et al ( 1989 ) and assume the fundamental plane relations to determine the initial halo mass ( normalized further to reproduce the mass - to - light ratio of the coma cluster ) and the x - ray data from rosat and asca satellites to determine the halo velocity dispersion .",
    "despite the simplifying assumptions we recover a density field which is in good agreement with the simple extrapolation of the reconstructed density field from larger scales .",
    "\\5 ) at the end of these steps we reconstruct the pregalactic density field over linear scales encompassing two orders of magnitude , @xmath526mpc .",
    "the recovered field is difficult to fit with cdm models and constant bias parameter over this range of scales .",
    "we argue that the most economical explanation of the density field on all scales would be to assume that the results in fig.20 represent the pregalactic density field with constant bias parameter @xmath527 and @xmath528 as required by dynamics of galaxy systems and the consistency between the x - ray observations of rich clusters and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( white et al 1993 )",
    "i am grateful to people who provided the data used in the paper : to sandy faber for providing the absolute photometric data for galaxies , kyoko matshushita for permitting me to use the results from her thesis on asca observations of galaxies , carlton baugh for the data on the be93 power spectrum , mike vogeley for the cfa data used for peculiar velocity calculations and will sutherland for the apm data binned in six narrow magnitude slices .",
    "particular thanks go to richard mushotzky for several valuable discussions on x - ray observations of galaxies and to raul jimenez on the age determinations of high redshift galaxies .",

    "<S> in this paper we evaluate the spectrum of the pregalactic density field on scales @xmath0mpc from a variety of astronomical data . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the apm data on the projected angular correlation function , @xmath1 , in six narrow magnitude bins and check whether possible evolutionary effects can affect inversion of the @xmath1 data in terms of the underlying power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by normalizing to the angular correlation function on small scales where the underlying 3-dimensional galaxy correlation function , @xmath2 , is known . </S>",
    "<S> using the apm data in narrow magnitude bins allows us to test the various fits to the apm data power spectrum more accurately . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for linear scales @xmath3mpc the baugh and efstathiou ( 1993 ) spectrum of galaxy distribution gives the best fit to the data at all depths . </S>",
    "<S> fitting power spectra of cdm models to the data at all depths requires @xmath4 if the primordial index @xmath5 and @xmath6 if the spectrum is tilted with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> next we compare the peculiar velocity field predicted by the apm spectrum of galaxy ( light ) distribution with the actual velocity data . </S>",
    "<S> the two fields are consistent and the comparison suggests that the bias factor is scale independent with @xmath8(0.2 - 0.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these steps enable us to fix the pregalactic mass density field on scales between 10 and @xmath9mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the next dataset we use to determine the pregalactic density field comes from the cluster correlation data . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate in detail the amplification of the cluster correlation function due to gravitational clustering and use the data on both the slope of the cluster correlation function and its amplitude - richness dependence . </S>",
    "<S> cluster masses are normalized using the coma cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we find that no cdm model can fit all the three datasets : apm data on @xmath1 , the data on cluster correlation function , and the data on the latter s amplitude - richness dependence . </S>",
    "<S> next we show that the data on the amplitude - richness dependence can be used directly to obtain the spectrum of the pregalactic density field . applying the method to the data , we recover the density field on scales between 5 and 25@xmath10mpc whose slope is in good agreement with the apm data on the same scales . requiring the two amplitudes to coincide , </S>",
    "<S> fixes the value of @xmath11 to be 0.3 in agreement with observations of the dynamics of the coma cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the data on high-@xmath12 objects to constrain the small - scale part , ( 1 - 5)@xmath10mpc of the pregalactic density field . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the data at high redshifts require more power than given by cdm models normalized to the apm and cluster data . </S>",
    "<S> then we reconstruct the pregalactic density field out of which modern - day galaxies have formed . </S>",
    "<S> we use the data on blue absolute luminosities , the fundamental plane relations and the latest x - ray data on the halo velocity dispersion . from this </S>",
    "<S> we recover the pregalactic density field on comoving scales between 1 and 5@xmath10mpc which is in reasonable agreement with the simple power - law extrapolation from the larger scales .    </S>",
