    "in this note , we comment on the ubiquity of the so - called warped anti - de sitter spacetimes in three - dimensional supergravity theory . these spacetimes are homogeneous vector - like deformations of anti - de sitter , defined on the group manifold @xmath1 such that the isometry algebra algebras denotes whether they generate the left ( right ) action on the group @xmath1 . ] of anti - de sitter @xmath2",
    "is broken to its subalgebra @xmath3 , which is the centralizer of a left - invariant vector @xmath4 in @xmath5 , @xmath6=0\\right\\ } ~.\\ ] ] the vector @xmath7 may in turn be timelike , spacelike or null with respect to the metric , which corresponds to an elliptic , hyperbolic or parabolic element .",
    "we accordingly call the warped anti - de sitter spacetimes as spacelike , timelike or null warped anti - de sitter .",
    "these solutions have appeared as supersymmetric solutions of the @xmath8 supergravity model in @xcite and recently as supersymmetric solutions of the @xmath0 model in @xcite .",
    "the motivating question of this note is `` _ _ how natural is the existence of these solutions ? _ _ '' . by using isometry - invariant tensors and simple counting",
    ", we will prove their existence for arbitrary @xmath0 supergravity models suitably defined close to a minimal model .",
    "although one may argue about the existence of these solutions for more general theories , we will concentrate firmly on @xmath0 anti - de sitter supergravity .",
    "the supersymmetry multiplet consists of a dreibein , a complex gravitino , two gauge fields and a real scalar .",
    "their supersymmetry variations close off - shell , so one can make a distinction between supersymmetry results that hold for a solution to an arbitrary @xmath0 supergravity model and the solution of a specific @xmath0 supergravity model .",
    "that is , we make here the important distinction between an ( offshell ) _ background _ and an ( onshell ) _ solution _ of a particular model .",
    "we will use a minimal model that contains the einstein - hilbert term , a cosmological constant , and a gravitational topological term .",
    "this model has been called the @xmath0 cosmological topologically massive supergravity @xcite , where the term massive refers to a massive gravity mode @xcite and cosmological due to the cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "the minimal model provides us with a rich set of warped anti - de sitter solutions .",
    "there are three instances where warped anti - de sitter has appeared with regard to @xmath0 supergravity    a.   a half - supersymmetric solution is found in @xcite that corresponds to timelike warped anti - de sitter .",
    "b.   all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds are found in @xcite , which include timelike , spacelike and null warped anti - de sitter . c.   the purely gravitational solutions that are discussed for instance in @xcite , which according to the results of @xcite",
    "are not supersymmetric .",
    "we make the following observations about these backgrounds and solutions .",
    "the half - supersymmetric solution in @xcite is produced from what is called there a general constancy ansatz that is imposed on supersymmetric solutions of the minimal model .",
    "it is generic in the sense that a ratio of coupling constants need only satisfy a certain inequality .",
    "the maximally supersymmetric spacelike , timelike and null warped anti - de sitter of @xcite was also produced in @xcite from what was called there the special constancy ansatz , again imposed on supersymmetric solutions .",
    "the special constancy ansatz produces this solution only if a ratio of coupling constants of the minimal model is at a fixed value .",
    "these observations motivate a couple of questions with regard to the landscape of warped anti - de sitter as supersymmetric backgrounds and as solutions to @xmath0 supergravity models .",
    "firstly , we ask whether `` there are any other warped anti - de sitter solutions to be found in the minimal model '' . indeed , the solutions of @xcite are the result of an ansatz imposed on supersymmetric solutions , the constancy ansatz , so there may be other warped anti - de sitter geometries that evade the method of @xcite , which may or may not be supersymmetric .",
    "we prove that the supersymmetric warped anti - de sitter solutions in @xcite contains all supersymmetric warped anti - de sitter solutions of the minimal model , and there is only one more class of non - supersymmetric warped anti - de sitter solutions , the purely gravitational solutions of case ( c ) above .",
    "perhaps more interesting than our result is the method we use .",
    "the method we employ to find all warped anti - de sitter solutions of the minimal model draws corrections .",
    "] inspiration from @xcite .",
    "it allows us to answer the motivating question `` how natural these solutions are '' not only for the minimal model but for other @xmath0 models or even more general theories .",
    "specifically , we call a warped anti - de sitter background a geometry on the group manifold @xmath1 where all fields are invariant under the isometry @xmath9 that was described in",
    ". we may then decompose all equations of motion into its isometry - invariant components , which comprise a finite dimensional space .",
    "this reduces the problem to a non - linear analysis of five algebraic equations for five algebraic constants .",
    "this provides a definite answer for both the minimal model and more general theories parametrically close to the minimal model .",
    "the second question we answer is `` which of the backgrounds preserve supersymmetry and how much '' .",
    "we thus find conditions for allowing none , one , or two complex supersymmetries . with regard to maximally supersymmetric backgrounds",
    "we are confirming parts of the results of @xcite and with regard to the half - supersymmetric solution of the minimal model we are confirming a part of the results of @xcite .",
    "the essential novelty of this section is then the conditions for allowing half - supersymmetric backgrounds , which may or not be solutions to any given theory . in any case , we provide here a supersymmetry analysis , namely the integrability of the killing spinor equations , by using invariant objects of the geometry .",
    "we conclude with the supersymmetry preserved by some isometric quotients .",
    "a schematic of the two questions and their answer is given in figure [ fig : venn ] .",
    "in sections  [ sec : preliminaries ] and  [ sec : wads ] we respectively introduce @xmath0 supergravity and define appropriately the warped anti - de sitter backgrounds . in section  [ sec : assolutions ] we answer the question of how natural these backgrounds are as solutions to @xmath0 supergravity models and in section  [ sec : assusy ] we analyze their supersymmetry .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : asquotients ] we conclude with a discussion on the killing superlagebras and their supersymmetric quotients .",
    "for ease of reading , we will relegate details of the null case to the appendix .",
    "we will not use explicit coordinates to parametrize @xmath1 , coordinate forms of the maurer - cartan one - forms and of the metrics can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the offshell supersymmetry transformations of the ( 2,0 ) supergravity multiplet were given in @xcite by fixing the scale of a three - dimensional superconformal multiplet .",
    "the supergravity multiplet then consists of a dreibein @xmath10 , a complex gravitino @xmath11 that transforms under a local @xmath12 with gauge field @xmath13 , an abelian gauge field @xmath14 and a real scalar @xmath15 .",
    "we define the field strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the mutiplet transform under a complex grassmann - odd spinor @xmath18 as @xmath19 } -\\frac{1}{4 }   \\bar{\\epsilon}\\,\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma^{\\nu\\rho}\\hat{d}_{\\nu}\\psi_{\\rho } - i \\bar{\\epsilon}\\,\\hat{g}\\,\\psi_\\mu - d\\bar\\epsilon\\ , \\psi_\\mu + \\text{h.c . }",
    "\\\\ \\delta d & =   -\\frac{1}{8 } i\\bar{\\epsilon}\\,\\gamma^{\\mu\\nu}\\hat{d}_{\\mu}\\psi_{\\nu } + \\text{h.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the supercovariant derivative is @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the supercovariant field strength of @xmath22 .",
    "our conventions for the gamma matrices are @xmath23 for a mostly plus signature metric and @xmath24 in an orthonormal basis with indices @xmath25 is a sign @xmath26 that depends on the volume form @xmath27 then , @xmath28-forms act on spinors via their image in the clifford module , e.g. @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . with these conventions ,",
    "we note the useful relation @xmath32for a one - form @xmath7 and that @xmath33 on the whole of the exterior algebra .",
    "we will identify and the action of the lie derivative along killing vectors , e.g. @xmath34 and @xmath35 are unambiguous . ] a vector @xmath7 with its metric - dual one - form @xmath36 , so that an expression such as @xmath37 also makes sense .",
    "the spinor inner product in the supersymmetry transformations is anti - hermitian for commuting spinors , but spinor bilinears will not enter our analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 multiplet transforms under a local @xmath38 as @xmath39 the supersymmetry parameter @xmath18 transforms with the same weight as @xmath40 , @xmath41 and it follows that the supercovariant derivative @xmath42 in is @xmath12 covariant .",
    "we will make the distinction between a ( bosonic ) background that is given by the data @xmath43 that might or not be a solution to an actual model , and a ( bosonic ) solution to a given @xmath0 supersymmetric model that is a background satisfying the model s equations of motion with @xmath44 . a killing spinor of a background @xmath43 is such that @xmath45 clearly , if @xmath18 is a killing spinor of a background then so is @xmath46 and killing spinors form a finite - dimensional complex space of maximal complex dimension two .",
    "therefore , the supersymmetry preserved by the background is either none , half or full .",
    "note that the distinction between a background and a solution is not meant to imply that any background is a solution to some suitable @xmath0 model .",
    "however , we may tacitly consider killing spinors as the fermionic counterpart of killing vectors and the supersymmetry transformations as the counterpart of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms , without a reference to any given theory .",
    "we will eventually want to connect to solutions of specific models .",
    "we choose the topological massive @xmath0 theory that is minimal in the sense that it provides a rich set of warped anti - de sitter solutions .",
    "the bosonic section of the lagrangian is given by @xmath47 and contains all @xmath0 supersymmetry invariant terms up to third - order derivatives @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian depends on two real parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which we may vary freely in order to fix the model in the theories parameter space .",
    "we will ultimately consider models that are parametrically close to the minimal model , in the sense of adding higher - order terms with small enough coefficients or by varying @xmath48 and @xmath49 from some fixed values .",
    "the equations of motion from the lagrangian are @xmath50 and the einstein equation @xmath51 where we define the symmetric and traceless cotton tensor @xmath52 note that @xmath15 and @xmath53 are fixed algebraically by and and can be replaced back into the lagrangian . in this model",
    "the two @xmath54 bundles are identified in and in fact one might locally integrate the gauge field equations of motion into a single massive vector equation .",
    "a more important note to us is that , a minimal model solution depends on the choice of orientation , e.g. its sign appears in the definition of the cotton tensor and the hodge operation in .",
    "it is also useful to recall that , if we set the gauge fields to zero , the model and supersymmetry transformations coincide with the purely gravitational @xmath55 cosmological topologically massive supergravity , whose supersymmetric solutions where solved for in @xcite .",
    "we will now introduce the warped anti - de sitter backgrounds . let us momentarily note that there are various types of @xmath1-invariant metrics , more general to warped anti - de sitter .",
    "however , warped anti - de sitter is an @xmath1-invariant deformation of anti - de sitter that may be characterized as a vector - like deformation , it enjoys special properties such as the supersymmetry in @xcite , and in fact appears frequently in the literature , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we will use the `` lorentzian '' conventions of @xcite for the @xmath56 bases .",
    "on @xmath1 we define the left - invariant mauer - cartan basis of one - forms @xmath57 and their dual left - invariant vector fields @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which generate the right action @xmath60 on the group manifold . they satisfy",
    "@xmath61= f_{ab}{}^cl_c \\longleftrightarrow { \\mathrm{d}}\\tau^a+ \\frac{1}{2}f_{bc}{}^a \\tau^b \\wedge \\tau^c = 0~,\\ ] ] where we use the convention that @xmath62 is completely antisymmetric and the @xmath63 labels on @xmath58 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are raised and lowered with a mostly plus minkowski metric @xmath66 .",
    "we also define the basis of right - invariant vector fields @xmath67 such that @xmath68= f_{ab}{}^cr_c~,\\ ] ] which commute with the @xmath58 and generate the left action @xmath69 , whence @xmath70 the three - dimensional anti - de sitter metric is the cartan - killing metric on the group manifold @xmath1 @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the cosmological radius . upon using that the @xmath64 transform in the @xmath73 representation of @xmath74 as an orthonormal frame , @xmath75 we may confirm that the anti - de sitter metric is indeed invariant under both the left and right action , as stated in .",
    "spacelike , timelike and null warped anti - de sitter is refered to the deformation of the anti - de sitter metric by a constant times @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a left - invariant one - form , @xmath78 we may use the @xmath79 action on @xmath77 to bring it to the form @xmath80 where the flip @xmath81 is also an inner automorphism of the algebra ( by also exchanging the sign of @xmath82 ) and @xmath83 may be rescaled freely by a lorentzian boost in @xmath79 , @xmath84 we then have the following cases of vector - like homogeneous deformations of anti - de sitter , the so - called warped anti - de sitter metrics @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath72 are constants .",
    "note that by null warped anti - de sitter we call both a negative and a positive sign deformation .    in each of the three cases , we may find the left - invariant vector @xmath7 that leaves @xmath77 invariant , i.e. @xmath87 , and thus leave the metric @xmath88 invariant .",
    "in fact , we may unambiguously relate @xmath77 and @xmath7 via the metric @xmath89 .",
    "let us use this convention for any vector @xmath90 and identify it with its metric dual one - form @xmath91 .",
    "we henceforth normalize @xmath7 to be unit @xmath92 in the spacelike / timelike case and @xmath93 in the null case , @xmath94 the isometry of the warped anti - de sitter metrics is the centralizer @xmath95 of @xmath7 in @xmath5 , as first mentioned in .    we will call a warped anti - de sitter background a background where all fields are invariant under the isometries of the warped anti - de sitter metric and not only the metric . let us explain what that means in the case of the spacelike warped anti - de sitter .",
    "let us denote the tangent bundle @xmath96 with a slight abuse of notation as the space of vector fields , i.e. sections of the former .",
    "we say that a vector field @xmath97 is isometry invariant , and write @xmath98 if it is left invariant by all isometries , i.e. under the infinitesimal action it satisfies @xmath99 let us expand the vector field @xmath90 in the left - invariant maurer - cartan basis @xmath64 ( more precisely expand the metric dual one - form of @xmath90 ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are generically functions on @xmath1 . since @xmath104 leaves the mc forms invariant , i.e. @xmath105 and acts freely on @xmath1 , we deduce that the @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are constants .",
    "but the remaining killing vector @xmath7 of spacelike warped anti - de sitter rotates the @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the vector representation @xmath108 of @xmath109 , hence we must have @xmath110 .",
    "that is , the space of isometry - invariant vector fields is a finite - dimensional vector space that is spanned by @xmath82 , @xmath111 we will thus require the gauge field @xmath112 to be proportional is a gauge field we require a gauge choice such that this is true . ]",
    "to @xmath82 up to a constant .",
    "one can similarly prove that the space of isometry - invariant two - forms is one - dimensional , @xmath113 and the space of isometry - invariant symmetric tensors is two - dimensional , @xmath114 analogous results exist for timelike warped anti - de sitter , e.g. in that case we will take @xmath112 proportional to @xmath106 up to a constant , and similarly for null warped anti - de sitter .    the unique geometry for the fields on the manifold @xmath1 such that the isometry group of spacelike warped anti - de sitter leaves them invariant , is parametrized by the spacelike warped anti - de sitter background @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are constants , the orthonormal frame we choose is @xmath121 and we define the sign @xmath122 .",
    "similarly , the timelike warped anti - de sitter background is @xmath123 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are again constants , the orthonormal frame we choose is @xmath124 and we define the sign @xmath122 .",
    "this is again the unique geometry for the fields that the isometry group of timelike warped anti - de sitter leaves invariant .",
    "finally , we present the null warped anti - de sitter background : @xmath125 where @xmath116 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are again constants , and we define the sign @xmath126 via the volume form @xmath127 note that we are presenting here two different null vector deformations that are differentiated by the sign @xmath92 .",
    "the details of null warped anti - de sitter is given in the appendix [ sec : null ] .",
    "for reasons of brevity , we will expose both spacelike and timelike warped anti - de sitter at the same time and differentiate s generate elliptic ( compact ) and hyperbolic ( non - compact ) subgroups of @xmath1 respectively .",
    "however , at the level of lie algebras where we work , @xmath7 may smoothly vary from being spacelike to being null and then timelike . ]",
    "the two with an upper or lower sign respectively .",
    "the two anstze are parametrized by the five parameters @xmath128 and two signs , see - .",
    "we will first find solutions in the minimal model and then generalize to other theories .",
    "any tensor made out of the fields of the backgrounds is necessarily invariant under the isometries .",
    "consider for instance the ricci tensor and the cotton tensor , which are made out of the metric , two symmetric tensors ( the cotton tensor is also traceless ) .",
    "the space of isometry - invariant symmetric tensors is a finite - dimensional vector space that is spanned by two elements : the metric @xmath88 and @xmath129 , see for instance .",
    "accordingly , the ricci and cotton tensors decompose in this basis as @xmath130 the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein equation that is proportional to @xmath131 also decomposes into two terms proportional to @xmath88 and @xmath129 with constant coefficients",
    ". that is , the entire einstein equation has only two non - trivial components , respectively those of @xmath88 and @xmath129 , with constant coefficient that we set to zero @xmath132 the two vector field equations for @xmath112 and @xmath133 also decompose into the space of isometry - invariant one - forms , which is a one - dimensional space that is spanned by @xmath7 alone , see for instance .",
    "we thus get two more algebraic equations from the vector equations .",
    "the equation for @xmath53 fixes @xmath118 in terms of @xmath119 , @xmath134 whereas the equation for @xmath133 gives @xmath135 the equation of motion for @xmath15 fixes @xmath136 we thus have five algebraic equations , - , we can use to solve for five unknown parameters @xmath137 .",
    "note that only involves @xmath118 , whence we can solve for @xmath118 easily , and from we solve for @xmath120 .",
    "the algebraic equations have four types of solution for the remaining parameters :    a.   [ item : ads ] anti - de sitter , for which @xmath138 note how anti - de sitter requires all gauge fields turned off so that its enhanced isometry @xmath5 is unbroken . b.   [ item : general]generic @xmath139 gives a real - parameter solution only for the timelike case @xmath140 the parameter @xmath86 can be both squashed @xmath141 or stretched @xmath142 . c.   [ item : special]for @xmath143 both timelike and spacelike warped anti de sitter can be found .",
    "it can be parametrized by @xmath144 for @xmath86 a free parameter .",
    "note how this requires @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) for spacelike ( timelike ) warped anti - de sitter .",
    "d.   [ item : puretmg]the purely gravitational timelike and spacelike warped anti - de sitter , with @xmath145 all vector fields are turned off .",
    "we henceforth stop grouping the spacelike and timelike warped anti - de sitter solutions with a sign .    by using isometry invariant tensors , the equations of motion",
    "decompose into five algebraic equations for five unknown parameters that yield four types of solutions .",
    "rather disappointingly , they comprise all known spacelike and timelike warped anti - de sitter solutions @xcite .",
    "anti - de sitter ( type [ item : ads ] ) is maximally supersymmetric . for generic @xmath146",
    "there is one purely gravitational spacelike warped anti - de sitter ( type [ item : puretmg ] ) and one purely gravitational timelike warped anti - de sitter ( type [ item : puretmg ] ) , and if holds then one timelike warped anti - de sitter solution ( type [ item : general ] ) that is according to @xcite half - supersymmetric . from the results of @xcite",
    "about @xmath55 purely gravitational tmg , both type [ item : puretmg ] solutions are not supersymmetric .",
    "for @xmath143 there is a line of solutions ( type [ item : special ] ) , which according to @xcite coincides with the maximally supersymmetric backgrounds of @xcite . at @xmath147 the generic solution type [ item : general ] and the purely gravitational solution [ item : puretmg ] coincide with anti - de sitter .",
    "the null warped anti - de sitter case is treated in the appendix [ sec : null ] and we summarize it here .",
    "both negative and positive deformed null warped anti - de sitter minimal model solutions are allowed for @xmath148 , and only the negative sign deformation for @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath148 solutions are purely gravitational .",
    "besides these , there are no other solutions",
    ". it should be possible to see some of the null warped anti - de sitter solutions as limits of the spacelike and timelike warped anti - de sitter solutions , type [ item : general ] and [ item : special ] , see @xcite .",
    "for instance , the limit for type [ item : special ] is manifest in @xcite , with @xmath150 there .",
    "we will now show that the method of decomposing into isometry invariants will yield type [ item : general ] and [ item : puretmg ] solutions for any putative @xmath0 theory that is suitably close to the minimal model .",
    "first notice that by including higher order terms , the equations of motion still decompose into five algebraic equations for five unknown parameters @xmath151 @xmath152 the @xmath153 parametrize an arbitrary number @xmath154 of higher - order terms of the lagrangian . in order to argue for the existence of a solution to these equations",
    ", we will consider a finite deformation from the minimal model .",
    "suitably close has the meaning of adding small enough higher order corrections to the lagrangian and these terms will only shift the parameters of the minimal model solutions .",
    "this perspective is influenced by  @xcite .",
    "consider first linearizing to first order the five equations with higher order terms with a derivation @xmath155 and evaluated at our theory parameters @xmath146 and solution the parameters @xmath151 that we found earlier , e.g. for the type [ item : general ] solution .",
    "we derive this way a @xmath156 linear system for @xmath157 in terms of an arbitrary number of linearized theory parameters @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 : @xmath161 since the type [ item : general ] solution is a fixed point solution of the minimal model , we may safely assume that the determinant of @xmath162 is non - zero .",
    "this would give a solution @xmath163 in terms of the @xmath164 .",
    "since the determinant is a continuous function on the space of @xmath156 matrices , the determinant will continue to be non - zero for small enough finite deformations .",
    "the deformation can thus be integrated by parallel transport , although the solution might depend on the path of the deformation .",
    "additionally , how small the finite deformation needs to be depends on the specifics of the higher order terms .",
    "for instance , if we simply vary only @xmath48 and @xmath49 then the inequality must be kept in order to preserve the solution .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for the anti - de sittter solution type [ item : ads ] : higher order terms will only correct the radius @xmath72 of the anti - de sitter solution and its scalar @xmath165 .",
    "this shows that the gauge fields will remain unexcited in the space of warped anti - de sitter backgrounds for small enough corrections from anti - de sitter space .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed on the purely gravitational solution type [ item : puretmg ] without exciting the gauge fields .",
    "the same analysis however can not be performed for the type [ item : special ] solution .",
    "this is because the equivalent linearized matrix at @xmath143 for this solution has zero determinant , because the solution is a line parametrized by @xmath86 .",
    "the ensuing analysis would depend crucially on the specific linearized theory parameters that are added and this is beyond the scope of this analysis .",
    "one may now broadly comment on the naturalness of the timelike and spacelike warped anti - de sitter solutions in more general theories . a theory with a metric , @xmath166 vectors and @xmath167 scalars will be parametrized by @xmath168 constants .",
    "this is the same number of isometry - invariant components of the field equations . whether the non - linear system of algebraic equations has a solution depends on the details of the theory",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a solution can always be explained in this framework naturally .",
    "the same is not true if we add , for instance , a higher - spin tensor .",
    "for instance , a spin - two symmetric field @xmath169 will be parametrized by two constants , but will typically obey two field equations , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , yielding ultimately three algebraic equations .",
    "the system would be in principle overdetermined .",
    "in this section , we ask how much ( 2,0 ) supersymmetry a warped anti - de sitter background admits . for",

    "this is still in agreement with @xcite . in their work",
    ", they find all backgrounds that are maximally supersymmetric , but the equations of a theory are not used .",

    "of course , non - supersymmetric minimal model solutions and non - supesymmetric backgrounds that are not solutions always exist .",
    "the regular isometric quotients of spacelike , timelike and null warped anti - de sitter were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the identification under an isometry , @xmath209 is required to either define a quotient without pathologies , or if such pathologies exist , namely closed causal curves , that they are hidden behind an absolute horizon as in the btz construction of @xcite .",
    "one may then ask how much @xmath0 supersymmetry the regular quotients will preserve",
    ". for the supersymmetric btz quotients see @xcite",
    ".    our treatment will not be exhaustive .",
    "we will concentrate on two quotients :    1 .",
    "the so - called self - dual quotient @xcite , see also @xcite , with @xmath210 on the maximally supersymmetric spacelike warped anti - de sitter .",
    "the `` asymmetric vacuum '' quotient , similar to the vacuum used in @xcite , which corresponds to the quotient of half - maximal timelike squashed @xmath141 anti - de sitter with @xmath211 .",
    "the minimal model solution for @xmath141 requires @xmath212    in both cases there are no pathologies  @xcite .",
    "however , the quotients might break some or all supersymmetry . in @xcite a specific killing spinor",
    "is explicitly solved for and shown to be independent of the angle @xmath213 in both of the above quotients .",
    "our purpose is to see precisely _ how many _ killing spinors survive and highlight some subtleties in the problem .",
    "we will now see that the first quotient , the self - dual quotient , is in fact maximally supersymmetric .",
    "this is because @xmath214 is central in the killing superalgebra and in particular it acts trivially on the space of killing spinors @xmath215 .",
    "indeed , the spinorial lie derivative along @xmath216 on any killing spinor @xmath18 is @xmath217 where we use the definition of a killing spinor to replace @xmath218 , the maximal supersymmetry conditions - , and the identity @xmath219 from . as a result , for @xmath220 we have",
    "that @xmath221 and all killing spinors survive the self - dual quotient .",
    "in fact , all of its killing superalgebra , i.e. including its killing vectors , commute with @xmath214 and hence are preserved by the quotient .",
    "let us comment that the killing superalgebra is not entirely trivial .",
    "the killing spinors transform under @xmath222 and the odd - odd bracket of two killing spinors should square into @xmath222 . note that @xmath214 leaves all of the background fields invariant , including the @xmath12 gauge field @xmath112 .    in order to discuss the supersymmetry preserved by the second quotient ,",
    "that on the half - supersymmetric space by @xmath223 , one should calculate the action of @xmath224 on its complex one - dimensional space of killing spinors @xmath225 . in order to do this , we will need the relation @xmath226 for the derivatives of the left - action killing vectors @xmath67 in the timelike warped anti - de sitter background .",
    "a sketch of the proof of is given in appendix [ app : dr ] .",
    "note here that such a form is expected from representation theory and only the constants in have to be calculated .",
    "then , by using the half - supersymmetry conditions of timelike warped anti - de sitter , and , the action turns out to be trivial : @xmath227 again , the quotient preserves its half supersymmetry . at the same time , the isometry algebra of the quotient is broken to the two commuting elements @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "note that the quotient vector @xmath230 preserves all fields including the gauge field @xmath112 .",
    "this concludes the study of the two quotients . in a sense",
    "we have been lucky , since the two quotients discussed preserve all the fields and the killing spinors .",
    "this was not expected a priori and a similar calculation to shows that in the case of the timelike half - supersymmetric warped anti - de sitter background , the killing vector @xmath231 does act on its killing spinor @xmath232 in fact , a different @xmath12 gauge choice , under which the killing spinor transforms as , will render the killing spinor invariant under @xmath7 .",
    "that is , is replaced with @xmath233 in a different gauge . however , in this new gauge choice the killing vector @xmath7 would not leave invariant the gauge field @xmath112 , as would follow from consistency of , and .",
    "although this did not happen in the two previous examples , more generally and if the fundamental group is not trivial then a supersymmetric quotient may be reached by using a @xmath12 patching under which both @xmath112 and the killing spinors transform .",
    "alternatively , the quotient might require a non - trivial spin structure , which may even include lorentz rotations .",
    "the identification under @xmath234 in the timelike half - maximal warped anti - de sitter discussed here is in fact supersymmetric and yields an anti - periodic spin structure @xmath235 . in any case , this discussion is not necessary since @xmath236 is timelike and the quotient has closed timelike curves .",
    "in this note we focused on warped anti - de sitter backgrounds in @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we gave conditions of when they preserve half supersymmetry and we also explained why one should indeed expect to find such solutions in the minimal model and its deformations .",
    "similar statements can be made for @xmath8 supergravity and indeed warped anti - de sitter features in the supersymmetric solution of @xcite .",
    "a simple counting shows that these solutions are in a sense natural .",
    "we hope to have given here a useful and clarifying answer about the ubiquity of these geometries , as was our motivation .",
    "all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds of @xmath0 supergravity where derived in @xcite . besides anti - de sitter and minkowski",
    ", the rest also have the form of a hopf - like fibration over a two - dimensional maximally symmetric space of either signature @xmath237 or else they are a generalization of a pp - wave .",
    "the lorentzian sphere is , in a similar sense to our definition , a vector - like deformation metric are equal as in .",
    "] of the round sphere .",
    "very similar results to what were produced here are expected for the lorentzian sphere . indeed , in @xcite the form of the superderivative on the squashed sphere that admits maximal supersymmetry is very similar to and .",
    "for instance , one may ask whether the maximal supersymmetric lorentzian sphere is a solution to the minimal or some other model , because the method of @xcite did not produce the maximally supersymmetric lorentzian sphere .",
    "we have not been exhaustive in all of our treatment in this note .",
    "for instance , there are still some healthy quotients of timelike squashed anti - de sitter without horizons and some other quotients of the null warped anti - de sitter , see @xcite . another interesting question that arises from our exposition",
    "is whether it is natural to expect only supersymmetric minimal solutions when the gauge fields are turned on .",
    "for instance , if one deforms the theory as in the end of section ",
    "[ sec : assolutions ] , one expects that the supersymmetry conditions of section  [ sec : assusy ] will not hold anymore .",
    "so why are all non - gravitational warped anti - de sitter solutions of the minimal model supersymmetric to begin with ?",
    "it is also not clear here under what conditions a supersymmetric theory deformation preserves the supersymmetry of the deformed solutions .",
    "the author acknowledges support from the scientific and technological research council of turkey ( tbitak ) project 113f034 .",
    "we repeat here the analyses for the case of null warped anti - de sitter . recall that we differentiate two backgrounds with a minus or plus sign , see .",
    "the ricci tensor and cotton tensor decompose into @xmath238 the minimal model equation of motion for @xmath133 gives @xmath239 the equation of motion for @xmath112 solves for @xmath118 , while the einstein equation of motion decomposes into @xmath240 and @xmath241 as before . with",
    "the radius @xmath72 fixed , the only solutions are    1 .   if @xmath242 , then both positive and negative purely gravitational @xmath243 null warped anti - de sitter are allowed .",
    "if @xmath143 , then the negative deformation is allowed with @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "note that only the last solution has the vectors turned on , and both solutions impose a restriction on @xmath48 or @xmath49 , @xmath148 and @xmath143 respectively .    in order to write the killing spinor equation",
