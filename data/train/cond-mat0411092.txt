    "the theory of the cuprate high temperature superconductors remains one of the most important and daunting problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "the high @xmath2 cuprate superconductors are layered materials with relatively complex structures and chemical composition .",
    "they are highly correlated , with an effective bandwidth roughly equal to the effective local coulomb interaction .",
    "the short - range correlations are known to play a paramount role in these materials .",
    "therefore , the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite , which treats short - range correlations explicitly and the long - range physics at the mean - field level , is an ideal tool for the investigation of these systems .    a common characteristic all the cuprate materials share is the presence of quasi - two - dimensional @xmath3 planes .",
    "these planes are commonly believed to contain the low - energy physics . however , the full complexity of the orbital chemistry of just the @xmath4 planes and the strong coulomb repulsion on the cu ions would lead to models which are very difficult to study with conventional techniques .",
    "the cuprates are characterized by a very rich , but also in many respects very intriguing physics .",
    "the undoped materials are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulators with a gap of approximatively @xmath5 . upon doping the afm",
    "is destroyed and the system becomes superconducting ( sc ) . at small doping , in the proximity of the afm phase , the normal state physics can not be described in terms of fermi liquid theory and is characterized by the presence of a pseudogap .",
    "an essential demand of every successful theory is to capture all these fundamental features at the same time .",
    "experimental data show that the phase diagram and other physical characteristics like the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level of the hole - doped and electron - doped materials are very different  @xcite",
    ". there could be many reasons for this asymmetry .",
    "the electron and the hole doped materials are physically different and apart from the @xmath4 planes , they contain different elements and chemical structures . these structural and compositional differences can influence the low - energy physics . therefore in this paper",
    ", we use dca to address whether the physics of a pure @xmath4 plane contains this asymmetry or if the origin of the asymmetry in real materials comes from other influences .",
    "different models for describing the physics of a @xmath3 plane were proposed by various authors .",
    "photoemission experiments in the insulating parent material show that the first electron - removal states have primarily oxygen character ; whereas , the first electron - addition states have @xmath6 character , already suggesting a strong asymmetry .",
    "this places these materials in the charge - transfer gap region of the zaanen - sawatzky - allen scheme  @xcite .",
    "early on , considering the ligand field symmetry and band structure calculations  @xcite , it was realized that the most important degrees of freedom are the cu @xmath7 which couple with the in - plane o @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "therefore , one of the first models proposed to describe the physics of high @xmath2 materials was the so called _ three - band hubbard model _ introduced by varma _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and emery _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which considers explicitly both the oxygen @xmath9 and the cooper @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "in fact , because the direct oxygen - oxygen hopping is neglected , only the combination of oxygen orbitals with @xmath10 symmetry couples with the @xmath6 orbitals , and the above proposed three - band model reduces to a two - band one .",
    "however zhang and rice ( zr )  @xcite argue that the low - energy physics of the _ hole doped _ superconductors can be described by a single - band model . starting from the two - band model , zhang and rice claim that an extra hole added into the oxygen band binds strongly with a hole on the @xmath11 , forming an on - site singlet .",
    "this singlet state , which has zero spin can be thought as moving through the lattice like a hole in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "consequently , the physics can be described by a one - band t - j model .",
    "pertinent criticism to these simplified models were raised by various authors . with respect to cu degrees of freedom , h. eskes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite stressed the possible importance of the other @xmath6 orbitals , showing that they should be explicitly considered when physics which implies excitations with energy larger than @xmath12 is involved .",
    "however , these criticisms do not concern us for the present study since we are interested only in physics at energies lower than @xmath13 .    investigating the relative importance of various parameters describing the @xmath3 planes it was realized early on that in addition to the cu on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath14 ) and cu - o hopping integral ( @xmath15 ) the o - o hopping integrals result in a large o @xmath16 band width ( @xmath17 ) , indicating that these should be included explicitly in any theory  @xcite",
    "therefore , using the dca technique as a means of including all these most important parameters and bands , we address two major problems in this paper : the physics of the @xmath3 plane ( including a detailed study of the electron - hole asymmetry ) and the reduction of the multi - band model to a single - band model .",
    "regarding the reduction to a one - band model , one of the most serious criticisms to zr theory is the neglect of the o @xmath16 band structure  @xcite .",
    "the natural tendency of the finite oxygen bandwidth is to delocalize and destabilize the zr singlets .",
    "the question arises whether the low - energy states ( i.e. the zr singlets ) are still well separated from the higher energy states ( i.e. the non - bonding oxygen states ) .",
    "otherwise , the reduction to a single - band model which neglects these high energy states is not possible .",
    "this problem was previously considered by eskes and sawatzky  @xcite within an impurity calculation approach , but there , unlike in the dca approach , both the spatial correlation effects and the dispersion of the low - energy states were neglected .",
    "another important objection to zr theory was first raised by emery and reiter  @xcite , and regards the nature of the low - energy states .",
    "are these states real singlets which can be mapped onto holes , or does the hole on the o bind into a more complicated state which involves more than one cu hole ? choosing a particular solvable example , which considers the cu spins arranged ferromagnetically , they showed that the low - energy states are in fact an admixture of the zhang - rice singlets and the corresponding triplets .",
    "this implies a nonzero value for the oxygen spin , and destroys the equivalence of these states to holes .",
    "however , it is not clear if the situation is similar in the cuprates , i.e. if the zr singlet - zr triplet admixture is significant .",
    "but the merit of emery and reiter is to emphasize that the fact that , as a consequence of the strong cu - o hybridization low - energy states well separated from the non - bonding oxygen band states appear , does not necessarily mean that the physics can be reduced to a single - band model .",
    "the third problem we address regarding the reduction to a single - band model is the estimation of the single - band parameters .",
    "we notice that different approximations result in different values of the parameters .",
    "especially the magnitude of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping is very dependent of the initial assumptions .",
    "for example , if we assume that the hole addition low - energy states are genuine zr singlets , i.e bound states between a cu hole and a orthogonal wannier oxygen orbital , we obtain a negligible next - nearest - neighbor hopping  @xcite . on the other hand , if we consider the low - energy states to be plaquette singlets , i.e. bound states between a cu hole and a hole on the state formed by the four oxygen around the cu , the value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping is significant  @xcite . of course , because of the nonorthogonality of the plaquette states , the plaquette singlets are not genuine singlets and therefore they can not be rigorously mapped into holes .",
    "however , because their overlap with the local singlets is large ( @xmath18 )  @xcite , it is still possible that this approximation is good .",
    "our calculations show that a multi - band model and a single - band t - t-u hubbard model with a significant value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping exhibit a similar low - energy physics .",
    "the essential parameter needed for the agreement is the next - nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter is also the main culprit for the observed electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the large value of @xmath0 can not be obtained in a strict zr picture .",
    "thus our results also implicitly indicate that the multi - band model can not be rigorously reduced to a single - band model .",
    "therefore , besides showing the similarities between the two models , we also point out their significant differences in this paper .",
    "the final conclusion is that a single - band t - t-u hubbard model , with a significant value of @xmath0 , captures the basic physics of the cuprates , and thus is suitable to describe the afm , pseudogap and sc physics together with the relevant asymmetries observed in the phase diagram , in the one - particle spectra and in the two - particle response functions .",
    "however , we believe that it is not suitable for a quantitative material specific analysis , for describing the higher energy spectroscopic features as in optical spectroscopy or resonant inelastic x - ray scattering , or for studying more subtle features related to the finite value of the spin on the oxygen .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : form ] the two - band hubbard model and the dca technique",
    "is introduced .",
    "our two - band model takes fully into account the oxygen dispersion and considers only the oxygen degrees of freedom which couple directly to the cu @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "the results of the dca calculation applied to the two - band hamiltonian are presented in section  [ sec:2bm ] .",
    "the possible reduction of the two - band model to a single - band one , together with a detailed analysis of the single - band t - t-u hubbard model , is addressed in section  [ sec:1bm ] . a discussion regarding the similarities and the differences between the two - band model and the single - band one is given in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the conclusions of our study are reviewed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "band structure calculations  @xcite , cluster calculation  @xcite , photoemission  @xcite and other experiments show that the relevant cu degrees of freedom are the @xmath7 orbitals which couple with the in - plane @xmath19 and @xmath20 o orbitals .",
    "all these degrees of freedom result in a five - band ( four oxygen and one copper band ) hamiltonian in general .",
    "we have studied the five - band model in detail  @xcite and have found that due to the strong cu - o hybridization , only the oxygen degrees of freedom which couple directly with cu are relevant for the low - energy physics .",
    "consequently , to a very good approximation , the five - band model can be reduced to a two - band one .",
    "the two - band model contains one cu @xmath7 correlated band and one oxygen band . at every site",
    "the oxygen states are obtained by taking a linear combination with @xmath21 symmetry of the four o @xmath22 orbitals which form a plaquette around the cu ion .",
    "these are the only oxygen states which hybridize directly with cu .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that these plaquette states are not orthogonal , two neighboring states sharing a common oxygen atom .",
    "an orthogonal basis can be obtained by the procedure described in the original zr paper  @xcite .",
    "first , applying a fourier transform , translational invariant ( bloch ) states are constructed .",
    "the bloch states are orthogonal but not normalized , so they should be multiplied by a normalization factor @xmath23^{-1/2}~.\\ ] ] after normalization a complete and orthonormal set of oxygen states is obtained .    in this basis",
    "the two - band hubbard hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath24    we work in the hole representation and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) represents the creation operator of a cu ( o ) hole with spin @xmath27 and momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the o band dispersion and the cu - o hybridization are given by @xmath29 @xmath30    with @xmath31 being the o - o hopping integral .",
    "the last term in eq.[eq : ham ] represents the coulomb repulsion between two holes on the same @xmath6 orbital .",
    "we choose the commonly accepted values of the parameters , based on the band structure calculations of mcmahan _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and hybertsen _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite because of the low density of oxygen holes ( @xmath32 ) , we treat the coulomb repulsion on @xmath33 ( given by @xmath34 ) and the repulsion between nearest - neighbor cu and o holes ( given by @xmath35 ) at the mean field level as a reasonable approximation .",
    "the effect will be an increases of our estimation for @xmath36 by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the average occupation of cu and respectively o bands . a choice of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 results in a increase of @xmath43 by @xmath44 .    to conclude , we take in eq .

    "the dca maps the lattice to a finite - sized cluster embedded in a host .",
    "non - local correlations up to the cluster size are treated explicitly , while the physics on longer length scales is treated at the mean field level .",
    "this technique is ideal for the problems where short - ranged correlations are predominant as in the high-@xmath2 materials . here",
    "we calculate the properties of the embedded cluster with a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm .",
    "the cluster self - energy is used to calculate the properties of the host , and this procedure is repeated until a self - consistent convergent solution is reached .",
    "the self - energy and vertex functions of the cluster are then used to calculate lattice quantities .",
    "a detailed description of the qmc - dca algorithm is given in ref .",
    "@xcite    in the two - band model the oxygen degrees of freedom are not correlated , and therefore they are not included explicitly in the cluster .",
    "their effect is fully contained in the cluster - host hybridization function and in the host green s function .",
    "here we consider a @xmath50 cluster of cu ions , which we believe to be large enough to capture the essential physics of hubbard - type models .",
    "the @xmath50 cluster will result in a coarse - graining of the bz in four cells , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : zr ] and the hole addition states would be of pure o character . when the cu - o hybridization @xmath56 is switched on , the extra holes added to the oxygen band will scatter with the @xmath11 spins and bound states will appear at the bottom of the oxygen band .",
    "this is illustrated by the solid line , which plots the partial @xmath6 dos which was obtained using the maximum entropy method ( mem)@xcite for the analytic continuation of the qmc data to real frequencies .",
    "it can be noticed that the first hole addition states have a strongly mixed @xmath6 and @xmath8 character ( the @xmath6 character in the spectrum is large now ) and an energy pushed well below the edge of the initial non - bonding oxygen band .",
    "therefore only these states are relevant for the low - energy physics   up to @xmath57 hole doping . ] . in the zr theory these low - energy states which appear as a consequence of the strong cu - o hybridization are considered to be local singlets which move through the lattice like holes in an afm background .",
    "consequently the claim is that the physics can be described by a one - band t - j model .        in order to determine the phase diagram we calculate a large number of susceptibilities which are relevant for spin , charge and superconducting ordering , both at the center and the corner of the bz .",
    "for example , the nel and sc critical temperatures , @xmath58 and respectively @xmath2 in the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] are determined from the divergence of the corresponding susceptibilities .",
    "the pseudogap crossover temperature @xmath59 is obtained from the maximum in the uniform magnetic susceptibility when accompanied by a suppression of spectral weight in the dos .",
    "similar to what was found in the single - band hubbard model  @xcite , we find afm and d - wave sc for both electron and hole doped regimes . however the electron - hole symmetry is broken . in the electron doped case afm",

    "the total dos looks qualitatively similar and at the chemical potential we see in both cases a depletion of states which indicates the presence of the pseudogap .",
    "the @xmath47 dependent dos is very different .",
    "the important feature which we want to stress is the location of the pseudogap in the bz . in the hole doped case",

    "@xmath72 corresponds to the pseudogap ( seen in the dos ) onset temperature .",
    "the suppression of the spin excitations below @xmath72 was also seen in nmr  @xcite experiments and it was associated with the pseudogap . besides these common features the electron and the hole doped susceptibilities behave differently .",
    "generally , the maximum value of the spin susceptibility increases with hole filling .",
    "this means that in the hole doped case , the spin susceptibility at the pseudogap temperature is strongly increasing with doping unlike in the electron doped case where it decreases upon doping . at the same doping the hole doped spin susceptibility is much larger than the electron doped one .",
    "another interesting feature is the very strong increase of the charge susceptibility for the electron doped case in the underdoped region ( @xmath63 doping ) , suggesting a tendency towards phase separation  @xcite .",
    "asymmetric behavior can also be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scsus ] , where we plot the _ inverse _ of the @xmath6-wave paring susceptibility .",
    "above @xmath73 the pairing susceptibility increases with doping in the electron doped case and remains more or less constant in the hole doped case .    because of the large cu - o hybridization the system is strongly covalent .",
    "for example in the undoped regime the cu occupation number is only @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that the cuprates are strongly covalent was also observed in nmr measurements  @xcite .",

    "it can be noticed that , for the electron doped regime , the cu hole occupation number is decreasing faster than the hole concentration , which indicates an increasing covalency with increasing electron doping .",

    "the extra holes go primarily on the oxygen band , and therefore we do not have a direct measure of the covalency .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndmiu]-a the unscreened moment on the cu orbitals is shown .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath80 the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a measure of the double occupancy with holes on cu sites . in the electron doped regime",
    "the double occupancy is very small , but it increases substantially in the hole doped regime , which indicates that the low - energy hole addition states contain double occupied cu configurations in a significant measure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndmiu]-b the screened moment on cu , defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is cu spin operator at site @xmath85 , is shown . the main effect of the extra holes is to screen the spins on the cu sites .",
    "the screening starts to be effective bellow temperatures of about @xmath13 ( not shown ) . in the zhang - rice scenario",
    "an extra hole perfectly screens one spin on cu forming a strongly bound on - site singlet which would contain a significant amount of the double occupied cu configuration .",
    "so , our results do not contradict the zr theory , but also do not exclude other scenarios where the extra holes form more complicated bound states which involve more than one cu spin .",
    "quantitative analysis based on the amount of screening as function of hole doping can not give an answer to the validity of the zr assumption , because , aside from the screening due to the oxygen holes , there are also non - local processes which contribute to the screening of cu moments ( for example , a possibility is the formation of inter - site spin singlets associated with the resonance valence bond scenario ) .",
    "concluding that the electron - hole asymmetry is an intrinsic property of the @xmath3 plane , we next address the cause of this asymmetry and the possible reduction to a one - band model .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2bm ] we showed that , due to the cu - o hybridization , the addition of holes results in the formation of low - energy states , with an energy well bellow ( @xmath12 ) the initial oxygen band ( see fig .  [",

    "the reduction to a one - band model is based on the zr claim that these states are singlets , i.e. spinless entities which can be regarded as holes moving in an antiferromagnetic background . due to the monte carlo nature of our calculation , which does not provide a wave function for the ground state",

    "the oxygen operators @xmath88 describe the orthogonal wannier states .",
    "the zr assumption implies that @xmath89 is responsible for the formation of the low - energy states ( local singlets ) , and @xmath90 will determine the hopping parameters .",
    "therefore the cell - perturbation theory provides a means to determine the one - band parameters provided that the zr assumption is correct .",
    "elaborate calculations along this line were done in  @xcite for a variety of multi - band parameters . in a first order approximation in @xmath91 ,",

    "[ eq : jj ] by @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , a comparison with a one - band hubbard model , should be done cautiously .",
    "second , we want to stress that the value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) is very small compared to the nearest - neighbor terms .",
    "the reason is that the initial oxygen - oxygen hybridization , @xmath31 , results in an effective hopping term comparable in magnitude with the one resulting from the copper - oxygen hybridization , but with a different sign .",
    "this was also remarked in  @xcite , and turns out to be an important observation for our final conclusions .",
    "the other approach used for determining the parameters of the one - band model is based on a cluster calculation . in order to estimate the nearest - neighbor hopping , the next - nearest - neighbor hopping and the exchange terms , eskes _",
    "@xciteconsidered two clusters , @xmath108 ( which contains two nearest - neighbor cu ions ) and respectively @xmath109 ( which contains two next - nearest - neighbor cu ions ) .",
    "the exchange term is determined as the energy difference between the singlet and the triplet state of two holes on a cluster . for three holes on a cluster , the two energetically lowest states",
    "can be very well ( @xmath110 ) approximated with the bonding and anti - bonding states of a _ plaquette zr singlet _ hopping between the two cells .",
    "therefore , the differences between these two levels is two times the zr singlet hopping , @xmath101 . in an analogous way ,",
    "considering only one hole on a cluster , the electron hopping , @xmath102 , is determined . using the cluster approach , our two - band model results in the effective parameters shown in the second row of the table  [ tab : zrparam ] .",
    "it can be immediately noticed that the two approaches produce different parameters , especially regarding the value of the next - nearest - neighbor hoppings . in the cluster calculation",
    "we obtain significant next - nearest - neighbor hoping terms , @xmath111 and @xmath112 with different sign for the hole and respectively electron doped case ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between the two approaches is that , unlike the cell - perturbation method which considers local singlets , the cluster approach considers singlets between a cu hole and a oxygen state formed on the plaquette around the cu ion .",
    "since the oxygen plaquette states are nonorthogonal it is possible to write them as a linear combination of many orthogonal oxygen states at different sites , i.e. the plaquette singlets are nonlocal states ( in the orthogonal base ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that at first glance this non - locality seems irrelevant ( the overlap of the local oxygen states with the plaquette states  @xcite is about @xmath18 ) , but apparently it turns out to influence the value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping of the reduced hamiltonian considerably .",
    "as pointed out by emery and reiter  @xcite , the plaquette singlets are in fact an admixture of zr singlets and zr triplets and this can result in a significant value of the spin - spin correlation on the oxygen sites  .",
    "of course , if the zr singlet - zr triplet admixture is significant , this will make a rigorous reduction to a one - band model impossible , because now the low - energy states have also a spin component and therefore can not be mapped into holes ( spinless entities ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in the cluster approach , the large value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms results solely from the finite oxygen dispersion and the lack of hopping between the copper and the next - nearest neighbor oxygen plaquette state . on the other hand , in the cell - perturbation theory a copper - next - nearest neighbor oxygen hopping term is present .",
    "it results in an effective next - nearest - neighbor hopping with a sign different than the one produced via oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "we believe that a comparison between the two - band hubbard model and a single - band hubbard model should be done with extreme caution .",
    "we want to stress the possible problems here .",
    "first , the reduction based on the zr approximation , which results in a single - band t - j ( or t - t-j ) model assumes the strong - coupling limit , i.e. a ratio @xmath115 ( the two - dimensional bandwidth is @xmath116 ) . the low - energy density of states of the two - band model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] indicates a bandwidth of the order of the gap , showing that we are rather at the intermediate - coupling than at strong - coupling .",
    "in the cell - perturbation theory we get @xmath117 , which also suggests intermediate - coupling physics . therefore , the question to be asked is whether the intermediate coupling regime , characterized by an effective repulsion of the same order of magnitude as the bandwidth , can still be well approximated by a second - order perturbation reduced t - j model .",
    "second , considering the previous objection , one may think that a reduction to the single - band hubbard model in intermediate coupling regime , rather than to a t - j model , is more appropriate . however , serious problems arise from the fact that , in the zr theory the nature of the antiferromagnetic correlations is different from that in the single - band hubbard model , i.e. it is not directly related with the quasiparticle ( zr singlet or electron ) hopping . therefore ,",
    "unless both the two - band hubbard model and the one - band hubbard model can be reduced to a t - j model , a comparison between them does not make much sense . nevertheless , we believe that even when the effective repulsion is comparable with the bandwidth the second order perturbation theory which produce the t - j model can be used successfully . we are going to discuss this at the beginning of the next section ( sec .  [ ssec : ttu ] ) .",
    "third , the non - locality of the low - energy states ( in the sense discussed in sec .",
    "[ sssec : comp ] ) can have very serious consequences beyond determining the value of the hopping parameters , making the single - band approach to fail completely .      , for different values of the ratio @xmath118 of the single - band hubbard model .",
    ", width=316,height=211 ]    the t - j model results as a low - energy effective hamiltonian from the hubbard model by projecting out the doubly occupied states .",
    "therefore , the double occupancy of the site orbitals constitutes a measure of the validity of this approximation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : docc ] we plot the double occupancy of the site orbitals for different values of the ratio @xmath118 .",
    "it can be noticed that for @xmath119 the double occupancy is always smaller than @xmath120   beyond this value , the double occupancy increases fast , being about @xmath121 for @xmath122 . ] .",
    "this indicates that , even in the intermediate coupling regime the low - energy physics of the one - band hubbard model can be well described by a t - j model .    even if , it is more natural to compare the two - band model with a t - t-j ( or a t - t-j - j ) model , this turns out from our perspective to be rather inconvenient due to the technical difficulties encountered by the qmc when applied to such models .",
    "therefore , we proceed by comparing the two - band model with a t - t-u hubbard model , focusing on the qualitative features rather than on a quantitative comparison . in the strong - coupling limit , the t - t-u model reduces to a t - t-j - j model , with the constraint @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that if the value of @xmath124 is not too large and the reduction of the two - band model to a single - band model is valid , the two models should exhibit similar physics .    assuming that the reduction to a one - band model in the spirit of the zr approximation is possible",

    "however , we believe that the comparison of only the one - particle and the two - particle spectral functions is compelling enough , especially since the experimental information is also obtained by measuring the response functions behavior ( and in almost all cases the two - particle operators or the one - particle ones , as in photoemission , are involved ) .",
    "it is also true that a comparison of the dynamic susceptibilities would be required , but with our quantum monte carlo based algorithm the calculation of these quantities for the two - band model is extremely computational resources consuming and has not been done yet .",

    "[ sec:1bm ] is that a t - t-u hubbard model describes qualitatively well the physics of the two - band hubbard model , but only if a substantial next - nearest - neighbor hopping is considered .",
    "however , the calculation in sec .",
    "[ sssec : cell ] ( first row of table .",
    "[ tab : zrparam ] ) and the more rigorous results by feiner _",

    "@xcite , show that in a strict zr picture the next - nearest - neighbor hopping is negligible . therefore it is difficult to explain the two - band hubbard model physics assuming the formation of local zr singlets . for hole doped systems ,",
    "a significant value of @xmath0 can be obtained only if the extra holes form nonlocal bound states with the existing cu holes , presumably something close to the plaquette singlets .",
    "of course we have no reasons to discard other states spread over even more oxygen sites , which can result in a magnitude of the hopping parameters different ( probably not too much ) form the one obtained by cluster calculation ( second row of table .  [",

    "the critical exponent @xmath137 which defines the divergence of the susceptibility at @xmath2 , is much smaller ( around @xmath157 at finite hole doping ) than the one characteristic to the one - band model ( around @xmath158 ) , indicating larger fluctuations   from the mean - field value @xmath159 is a measure of fluctuation . ] .",

    "we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "the one - band hubbard model retains much of the two - band hubbard model physics , but a significant next - nearest - neighbor hopping ( @xmath1 ) should be provided .",

    "we use dca to study the role of the different parameters in the single - band t - t-u hubbard model and compare the phase diagram , the one - particle and the two - particle response functions with the corresponding two - band hubbard model ones .",
    "we conclude that the two models exhibit similar low - energy physics provided that a significant next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 is considered .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is also the main culprit for the electron - hole asymmetry of the cuprates .",
    "the large value of @xmath0 needed for a qualitative agreement between the two models can not be obtained in a strict zr picture where the extra holes form local singlets with the existing cu holes .",
    "plaquette singlets , which in the oxygen wannier representation are not local , and presumably other spatially extended states can provide a larger value of @xmath0 .",
    "the doping dependent covalency in the electron doped case also indicates that the non - local cu - o hybridization is important .",
    "however , the formation of non - local low - energy states also implies that they are not real singlets and consequently can not be rigorously mapped into holes and therefore the two models are not equivalent .",
    "we also point out some differences between the two models . in the two - band hubbard model the fluctuations in the @xmath6-wave pairing channel above @xmath2 is much stronger . the deduction of the parameters both in cell - perturbation and cluster approach results in a larger nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath127 for the hole doped regime .",
    "however the critical temperatures @xmath59 and @xmath2 in the two - band hubbard model are approximatively the same in both regimes , quite different from what should be expected .",

    "<S> we calculate the properties of the two - band hubbard model using the dynamical cluster approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram resembles the generic phase diagram of the cuprates , showing a strong asymmetry with respect to electron and hole doped regimes , in agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> asymmetric features are also seen in one - particle spectral functions and in the charge , spin and d - wave pairing susceptibility functions . </S>",
    "<S> we address the possible reduction of the two - band model to a low - energy single - band one , as it was suggested by zhang and rice . comparing the two - band hubbard model properties with the single - band hubbard model ones , we have found similar low - energy physics provided that the next - nearest - neighbor hopping term @xmath0 has a significant value(@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 is the main culprit for the electron - hole asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , a significant value of @xmath0 can not be provided in a strict zhang and rice picture where the extra holes added into the system bind to the existing cu holes forming local singlets . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that by considering approximate singlet states , such as plaquette ones , reasonable values of @xmath0 , which capture qualitatively the physics of the two - band model can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a single - band t - t-u hubbard model captures the basic physics of the cuprates concerning superconductivity , antiferromagnetism , pseudogap and electron - hole asymmetry , but is not suitable for a quantitative analysis or to describe physical properties involving energy scales larger than about 0.5 ev . </S>"
