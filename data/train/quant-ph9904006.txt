    "the classical statistical theory of thermodynamical phenomena , due largely to boltzmann , maxwell , and gibbs , is one of the cornerstones of 20th century physics .",
    "it describes equilibrium phenomena ranging from gas dynamics over steam engines to crystals , while its quantum extension accurately describes radiation phenomena , metals , and superconductivity , to name but a few examples .",
    "nature s tendency to move towards equilibrium following a perturbation  captured by boltzmann s second law",
    " implies that most everyday - life phenomena are indeed taking place in an equilibrated system , for which this theory is applicable and eminently successful . for the brief _ transitory _ periods , however , the time during which a system _ approaches _ equilibrium , our bag of tricks  containing the tools of statistical mechanics  is of little use",
    ". the canonical phenomena of this type are relaxation or transport processes , phenomena which are usually termed `` irreversible '' , and phase transitions for which the entropy is not a constant .",
    "the standard approach to deal with such situations is to study the @xmath0-body dynamics of the system , with a hamiltonian that includes an interaction term ( in equilibrium statistical mechanics the hamiltonian is a sum of non - interacting one - body terms ) and the construction of equations that follow the @xmath0-particle distribution function through time : the boltzmann equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach suffers from the drawback that it can only be solved in perturbation theory , which obscures the relation to the `` exact '' formalism of thermodynamics . in this paper",
    ", we would like to explore the possibility that a formalism well - known from engineering  shannon s statistical theory of information  provides a bridge between equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical phenomena , and that its quantum extension ( developed primarily in support of the recent efforts in quantum computation and communication ) represents an adequate framework to investigate certain quantum statistical phenomena that have so far resisted a satisfying treatment .",
    "naturally , however , we should not expect that the classical and quantum theory of information provides a complete theory of all non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "for most dynamics with complicated time - dependent interactions and many - body correlations , a transport - equation approach will still be the only tractable alternative .",
    "standard non - equilibrium phenomena are usually termed `` irreversible '' , an adjective that captures a practical aspect  a direction of time  which , however , we know not to be fundamental .",
    "rather , time - reversal invariance guarantees that all dynamics can , in principle , be reversed as long as the participating degrees of freedom can be controlled . even though this is clearly not always possible in practice , it may appear as an oversight that a practical limitation seems to be at the origin of a theorem  the second law of thermodynamics . indeed , as irreversibility is only practical",
    ", so must be the second law .",
    "if we were , then , able to devise a formalism in which the second law is replaced by a _ conservation law _ for entropy ( and in which case the second law would appear as a corollary ) we may then be in possession of a formalism that can quantitatively describe even the _ approach _ to equilibrium and other non - equilibrium statistical phenomena .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to point out that this formalism exists in the form of the classical theory of information , introduced by shannon  @xcite .",
    "its extension to the quantum regime ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) is particularly interesting as it consistently describes quantum unitary dynamics which dictates that the von neumann entropy  the quantum extension of the shannon entropy  is a _",
    "constant_.    in the next section we begin by describing the classical statistical theory of information in physical terms ( as opposed to the more engineering - oriented approach given in most textbooks  @xcite ) .",
    "we then apply it to two classical non - equilibrium statistical processes  measurement , and equilibration of an ideal gas  to demonstrate the use of the formalism in physics . in section 3",
    "we formulate the quantum theory with special emphasis on those aspects that differ from the classical theory , and discuss the epr paradox as an illustration .",
    "we present an application to black hole formation and evaporation  a quintessential non - equilibrium scenario  in section 4 .",
    "we close with conclusions and comments in section 5 .",
    "readers familiar with the information - theoretic approach to classical and quantum statistical phenomena may skip directly ahead to section 4 .",
    "the intimate relation between information theory and statistical mechanics has been pointed out earlier by jaynes  @xcite in order to _ justify _ statistical mechanics via information theory . here , we use information theory to _ extend _ statistical mechanics to the non - equilibrium regime .    the concept of entropy was introduced by shannon with respect to _",
    "random variables_. for a random variable @xmath1 that can take on values @xmath2 with probabilities @xmath3 respectively , the shannon _ uncertainty _ ( or entropy ) is given by h(x)=-_i=1^np_ip_i .",
    "[ shanent ] instead of random variables , however , we may imagine any physical system with enumerable degrees of freedom and enumerable states @xmath4 . as is well - known and we show below",
    ", the shannon entropy then represents the _ physical _ entropy of the system .",
    "in fact , this concept of entropy can be expanded to cover continuous variables , where it will suffer from the same ambiguity ( redefinition up to a constant ) as standard thermodynamical entropy . for the moment , let us confine ourselves to discrete degrees of freedom and imagine that any continuous variables are _ coarse - grained _ ( either by assuming appropriate boundary conditions , or else artificially . )",
    "the relation to boltzmann - gibbs entropy becomes manifest if we consider not _ general _ probability distributions @xmath5 , but an equilibrium distribution where the @xmath6 are given by the gibbs distribution : p_i=1ze^-e_i / kt , [ boltz ] where @xmath7 is the _ energy _ of state @xmath4 , and @xmath6 then represents the _ probability _ of @xmath1 to take on energy @xmath7 .",
    "note that this probability is normalized by the partition function @xmath8 . inserting ( [ boltz ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ shanent ] ) produces h = + z = 1kt(e - f ) [ class ] and confirms that the shannon entropy is just the standard physical entropy in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics when rescaled by the boltzmann constant @xmath9 : s = k h. above , we defined the free energy @xmath10 in the usual manner .",
    "similarly , thermodynamical averages are obtained via a= 1z_i=1^n a_i e^-e_i / kt for an observable @xmath11 that takes on the value @xmath12 in state @xmath4 .",
    "returning to random variables for a moment , imagine an additional variable @xmath13 that takes on states @xmath14 with probabilities @xmath15 .",
    "we can then define the conditional probability of finding @xmath1 in state @xmath4 , _ given _ that @xmath13 is in state @xmath16 p_i|j= , where @xmath17 is the _ joint _ probability to find @xmath1 in state @xmath4 and simultaneously @xmath13 in state @xmath18 .",
    "this concept will allow us to quantify _ correlations _ between degrees of freedom , a particularly important task in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "indeed , equilibrium can be _ defined _ as the state where `` all ` fast ' things have happened and all the ` slow ' things not ''  @xcite , which implies that all non - permanent correlations have vanished in equilibrium .",
    "armed with conditional probabilities , we can define the _ conditional entropy _ of system @xmath1 _ given _ that @xmath13 is in , say , state @xmath18 , i.e. , the entropy of @xmath1 if we are fully aware that @xmath13 is in state @xmath18 , or in other words , the _ remaining _ entropy of @xmath1 if @xmath13 is held fixed in state @xmath18 .",
    "naturally , this is defined as h(x|y_j ) = -_ip_i|j . also , the _ average conditional entropy _ of @xmath1 given @xmath13 is in _ any _ fixed state , or quite generally is _ known _ , is then h(x|y)=h(x|y_j)= -_ijp_ijp_i|j .",
    "[ condent ] the vertical bar in the expression @xmath19 denotes the conditional nature of the entropy , and is usually read as `` x given y '' , or `` x knowing y '' .",
    "armed with the conditional ( or remaining ) entropy , we can find a measure for the amount of correlation between two systems .",
    "this is just the ordinary entropy minus the remaining entropy if one of the system s variables are known : the _ shared _ entropy ( also called correlation , or mutual , entropy ) h(x : y ) = h(x)-h(x|y ) .",
    "this is the central quantity introduced by shannon : the mathematical measure of _ information _ and @xmath13 is customarily used to indicate a shared entropy , and reminds us that correlation entropy is symmetric : @xmath20 . ] .",
    "the relation between unconditional ( also called `` marginal '' ) entropies such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , mutual , and conditional entropies are best visualized by _",
    "venn diagrams_. in fig .  1",
    ", the area of each circle represents an entropy , whereas the union of both circles represents the joint entropy @xmath23 .    0.5 cm    it is straightforward to see that these quantities can be translated into thermodynamics , by replacing the arbitrary probability distributions by equilibrium ones .",
    "we can see immediately , however , why they play no role in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the probability of system @xmath1 to take on energy @xmath7 if @xmath13 has energy @xmath24 is trivial : it is just given by @xmath25 simply _ because _ @xmath1 and @xmath13 are in equilibrium .",
    "thus , in equilibrium , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . away from equilibrium , conditional and mutual _ thermodynamical _ entropies become crucial , as we now see .",
    "we first treat the dynamics of classical _ measurement_. a measurement involves the contact between two equilibrated systems , usually at different temperatures .",
    "the measurement device is constructed in such a manner as to induce correlations between some of its variables  the `` pointer''and the measured system s degrees of freedom ( those which we desire to measure ) . after the initial contact between the systems and subsequent relaxation , equilibrium is re - established but thermodynamics seems to offer a paradox : the entropy of the measured system appears to have been reduced .",
    "furthermore , this reduced entropy _ can _ be used to perform work  in apparent violation of the second law ( this puzzle is usually termed the _ maxwell demon _ paradox , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this dynamics is again practically irreversible , we can describe what happens in terms of the entropies introduced above .    before the measurement ,",
    "the system ( denoted by @xmath28 ) is independent of the measurement device ( denoted by @xmath29 , see fig.2a ) .",
    "they do not share any entropy , which implies that knowledge of any one of the systems will not allow any predictions about the other .",
    "bringing the two systems into contact introduces correlations , and reduces the _ conditional _ entropy of both @xmath28 and @xmath29 . note that before measurement , @xmath30 .",
    "the amount by which the conditional entropy is reduced is of course just the _ acquired information _ , or shared entropy @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "this shared entropy plays a fundamental thermodynamical role : for example it can be shown that erasing it requires the dissipation of an equal amount of heat  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the marginal entropy did not really decrease in this process , but rather _ stayed constant_. in contrast , the conditional entropy of @xmath28 is reduced , as can be seen by inspection of the diagram in fig .",

    "[ master ] turning eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) around : h(s)=h(s|m)+h(s : m ) demonstrates that non - equilibrium dynamics affects only the distribution of @xmath32 into either ( conditional ) entropy or information , that the two however always add up to @xmath32 .",
    "another example of irreversible dynamics is the notorious `` perfume bottle '' experiment , in which a diffusive substance ( let s say , an ideal gas ) is allowed to escape from a small container into a larger one .",
    "both the initial and the final state of the system is in equilibrium ; common wisdom however states that the entropy of the gas is _ increasing _ during the process , reflecting the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "we shall now show that this is not the case , by describing the gas in the smaller container by a set of variables @xmath33 , one for each molecule .",
    "the entropy @xmath34 thus represents the entropy per molecule .",
    "the entire volume , on the other hand , is described by the _ joint entropy _",
    "h_gas = h(a_1a_n ) , [ joint ] which can be much smaller than the sum of per - particle entropies , the standard ( equilibrium ) thermodynamical entropy @xmath35 h(a_1a_n)_i=1^n h(a_i)=s_eq .",
    "the difference is given by the @xmath36-body correlation entropy h_corr= _",
    "i=1^n h(a_i)-h(a_1a_n ) [ corr ] which can be calculated in principle , but becomes cumbersome already for more than three particles .",
    "we see that in this description the molecules after occupying the larger volume can not be independent of each other , as their locations are _ in principle _ correlated ( as they all used to occupy a smaller volume , see fig .",
    "these correlations are not manifest in two or even three - body correlations , but are complicated @xmath36-body correlations which imply that their positions are not independent , but linked by the fact that they share initial conditions .",
    "again , this state of affairs can be summarized by turning around eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) h(a_1a_n ) = _",
    "i=1^n h(a_i)-h_corr .",
    "we assume that before the molecules are allowed to escape , they are uncorrelated with respect to each other : @xmath37 , and all the entropy is given by the extensive sum of the per - molecule entropies .",
    "after expansion into the larger volume , the standard entropy increases because of the increase in available phase space , but this increase is balanced by an increase in the correlation entropy @xmath38 in such a manner that the actual joint entropy of the gas , @xmath39 , remains unchanged .    note that this description is not , strictly speaking , a redefinition of thermodynamical entropy . while in the standard theory entropy is an _ extensive _ , i.e. , additive quantity for uncorrelated systems , the concept of a thermodynamical entropy in the absence of equilibrium distributions has been formulated as the number of ways to realize a given set of occupation numbers of states of the joint system ( which gives rise to ( [ shanent ] ) by use of stirling s approximation , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and is thus fundamentally _ non - extensive_. assuming the systems @xmath12 are uncorrelated reduces @xmath40 to the extensive sum @xmath41 , and thus to an entropy proportional to the volume the systems inhabit . from a calculational point of view",

    "the `` missing '' entropy @xmath88 therefore is contained in radiation @xmath90 emitted during the collapse .",
    "this scenario , which is the time - reverse of the evaporation process considered next , naturally leads to a radiation field @xmath90 that is causally uncoupled from the black hole , as @xmath92 .",
    "tracing over the `` reference '' field @xmath72 leads to the trivial entropy diagram diagram @xmath93 .",
    "we need to keep in mind , however , that just as in the epr situation described previously , the wavefunctions of @xmath90 and the black hole are linked via entanglement with the quantum degrees of freedom @xmath72 .",
    "the processes of black hole formation and evaporation can be considered time - reverse images of each other .",
    "evaporation of black holes occurs through the formation of virtual particle ",
    "anti - particle pairs of energy @xmath94 close to the horizon due to quantum mechanical tunneling in the strong gravitational field .",
    "if one of the members of the pair disappears behind the horizon while the other manages to escape , the escaping particle appears to have a black - body spectrum with temperature @xmath95 , while the energy of the black hole is reduced by @xmath96 .",
    "the paradox occurring here thus appears to be the same as the one encountered in the condensation process .",
    "how does the radiation pick up the extra entropy ? in terms of quantum information theory , the creation of a particle  anti - particle pair is akin to the creation of an epr state with vanishing entropy , described by the entropy diagram in fig .",
    "however , just as in standard first - order `` evaporation '' transitions , the black hole has to provide in addition the latent heat for `` decondensation '' , i.e. , the energy to create the entropy @xmath88 .",
    "thus , a pair created with @xmath97 and temperature @xmath95 will not reduce the black hole mass by an amount @xmath98 , but by e = de - t_hs , which restores the entropy and energy balance .",
    "the entropy of the escaping particle is @xmath99 while at the same time the entropy of the black hole is reduced by ds_bh=4(m^2-(m - e)^2 ) = -s .",
    "arguments have been raised ( see the reviews  @xcite and in particular  @xcite ) that seem to imply that information stored in correlations and entanglement between the black hole and its surrounding radiation field can not be retrieved , even in principle .",
    "these arguments rest on the assumption that the ( low - energy ) quantum fields live in a hilbert space that is of the product form @xmath100 , and an application of the quantum no - cloning theorem .",
    "while the fields do live in a product hilbert space , the wavefunction of an epr pair created at the event horizon of the black hole indirectly becomes entangled with the hole the moment one of the particles crosses the horizon ( even though the quantum fields are separated by space - like distances ) and the combined quantum state becomes inseparable .",
    "this situation is not unlike the scenario we noted in the formation of the black hole , where the accreted particle and the radiation it emits when tumbling into the black hole can be considered an entangled , epr - type state ( albeit with real rather than virtual energy ) . just as in that case",
    "the radiation @xmath90 shared no entropy with the black hole , neither does the hawking radiation , while still being entangled with it .",
    "thus , the hawking radiation carries `` information '' about the inside of the hole in the same manner as the measurement of epr partners separated by space - like distances reveals correlations in measurement devices that are at space - like distances . yet",
    ", a fundamental problem remains that is unlikely to be solved within the present formalism .",
    "the hawking radiation  while emitted in a unitary manner and while information loss certainly does not take place  remains causally uncorrelated to the black hole as long as the horizon separates the black hole entropy from the radiation field . in a sense",
    ", we have to wait until the last moment  the disappearance of the black hole  for the entropy balance to be restored .",
    "this appears to put a severe strain on current black hole models , as it is hard to imagine that this much entropy can be stored in an ever - shrinking black hole .",
    "this problem is likely due to our incomplete understanding of late - stage black holes , rather than a problem intrinsic to quantum mechanics .",
    "an alternative solution would present itself if the bekenstein - hawking entropy could be understood in terms of a _",
    "conditional _ entropy . in that case ,",
    "entropy flow from the black hole to the outside via the formation of virtual pairs is understood easily , as the member of the pair that crosses the horizon not only has negative energy but also negative conditional entropy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig4]b ) . as a conditional entropy",
    "can become as negative as the marginal entropy of the system it is a part of , we can circumvent the argument that `` the black hole can not store the information until the end because it runs out of quantum states '' , because the radiation could `` borrow '' as much entropy as necessary from the black hole until the horizon has disappeared . within the present framework",
    ", there appears to be no physical picture which would suggest that the bekenstein - hawking entropy is in fact conditional .",
    "it is not inconceivable , however , that a quantum statistical information theory extended to curved space - time would reveal such a state of affairs .",
    "we have used a formalism developed in the exploration of quantum computers  quantum information theory  to describe quantum processes away from thermodynamical equilibrium , such as the formation and evaporation of black holes .",
    "the formalism emphasizes the _ conservation _ of entropy , and is particularly useful in situations where entropy is distributed over two or three systems .",
    "we emphasize that great care is needed in using the concepts of entropy and information consistently : information , for example , can _ never _ be `` stored '' in one system ( e.g. , a black hole ) .",
    "rather , information is a measure of correlation _ between _ two systems , which implies that information is _ always _ stored in correlations .",
    "the analysis of information storage in black hole formation and evaporation presented here is a simple application of these rules to a scenario in which black holes are considered special states of matter with an equation of state different from that of radiation ( or usual matter ) . transitions between those states occur continuously as the specific heat of black hole matter is negative  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "radiation and black hole matter are unstable at any time , and transitions must occur as long as matter of either kind is present . yet , a consistent formulation of the correlations between radiation and matter shows that entropy is not created during the process , and consequently that information is conserved .",
    "still , the mechanism by which the pure state is restored in the last stages of black hole evaporation may require deeper insights into quantum gravitational dynamics , and possibly an extension of information theory to curved space - time .",
    "we are indebted to h. a. bethe for many useful discussions , in particular for suggesting to us to address the impact of negative entropies on quantum statistical mechanics .",
