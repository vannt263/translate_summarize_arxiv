    "studies of statistical properties of complex quantum systems ( chaotic or disordered ) show that their eigenvalue spectra exhibit patterns of universal fluctuations , whose structure mainly depends on the fundamental symmetries of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "such a universality opens an attractive possibility of modelling the fluctuations by comparing them with those observed in long sequences of eigenvalues of random matrices of appropriate symmetry @xcite .",
    "namely , systems with no time reversal invariance are known to be adequately described by gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of complex hermitian matrices , and systems with time reversal invariance are described by gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) or gaussian symplectic ( gse ) ensembles of real symmetric or complex quaternion matrices , depending on the existence of strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "more recently , the interest in studying spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems was much revitalized by the understanding that their energy spectra display a universal change in their characteristics as a response to external perturbations of various kinds .",
    "the nature of the perturbation may vary considerably depending on the physical system , and usually involves application of external fields ( magnetic or electric ) , change of boundary conditions or the shape of the system , rearrangement of positions of impurities in disordered medium , or variation of temperature , pressure or any other tunable physical characteristics .",
    "one of the frequently used measures of parametric sensitivities of complex quantum systems is the distribution of level curvatures , which are defined as the second order derivative of eigenvalues with respect to a perturbation parameter .    in @xcite gaspard and co",
    "- authors developed expressions for the probability densities of level curvatures and found that the large curvatures must exhibit universal behaviour classified according to the underlying gross symmetries .",
    "indeed , the curvatures become large in the vicinity of avoided crossings of energy levels as functions of a parameter and their distribution can be simply related to that of small eigenvalue spacings . on the basis of extensive numerical investigations of both random matrices and several quantum chaotic systems ,",
    "zakrzewski and delande conjectured an analytical expression for the full distribution of curvatures @xcite . later on zakrzewski - delande formulae",
    "were derived analytically by von oppen @xcite and by fyodorov and sommers @xcite for the random matrix models of all three universality classes .",
    "however , in many relevant experimental circumstances , physical systems have accidentally more underlying symmetries ( frequently called  geometric \" ) acting in addition to the presence or the absence of the time - reversal invariance . such symmetries naturally induce classification of energy levels according to irreducible representations of the corresponding symmetry group , and the energy levels corresponding to different representations form statistically independent subsequences .",
    "only these subsequences may be then meaningfully compared with the universal random matrix patterns .",
    "in fact , a generic situation may be even more complicated , since geometric symmetries may not be exact , but approximate .",
    "this will clearly lead to spectra being a mixture of different subsequences with uncertain statistical consequences of mutual interference .",
    "recent experimental studies on acoustic resonance spectra in quartz blocks @xcite suggest that the system may fall into the latter category , and the deviations from standard theoretical predictions of parametric correlations may have their origin in remnant geometric symmetries .",
    "this fact motivated several groups to investigate the effects of partial symmetry breaking on the level curvatures @xcite . however , closed form analytical expressions for curvature distributions for the case of partly broken symmetries are not available , to the best of our knowledge .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a simpler , but related model .",
    "rather than studying level curvatures in a system with partly broken symmetry , we address the case of two non - interacting subsystems subject to a perturbation which induces both coupling between the subsystems and variation of parameters within each of the two subsystems .",
    "this should be generically the case for a perturbation which does not respect the underlying symmetry .",
    "of course , we do not claim that our simple model to be adequate for describing experimental situation in quartz blocks , but we rather hope that our results could help in indicating how various factors may affect the shape of level curvature distributions .    employing the random matrix calculations allows to derive exact expressions for the level curvature distribution as a function of relative weight of induced inter- and intra - sublattice osculating variations .",
    "the curvature distribution naturally interpolate between the simple cauchy - lorentz shape - characteristic for a pure symmetry - breaking perturbations which couple two subsystems without modifying them individually , - and the zakrzewski - delande formulas typical for perturbations respecting the underlying symmetry .",
    "we first treat a simpler case of complex hermitian matrices ( systems with broken time reversal invariance ) in detail , and then extend the derivations to the case of real symmetric matrices .",
    "our analytical calculations are supported and corroborated by accurate numerical simulations of random matrix ensembles .",
    "to study the parametric dependence of energy levels of a system with some underlying symmetry , we consider a random matrix model where the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the system linearly depends on a perturbation parameter @xmath1 : [ model]h()=+.for the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 we choose a block - diagonal matrix @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being @xmath5 random matrices ( complex hermitian or real symmetric ) taken either from gue or , respectively , from goe .",
    "these can be thought of as representing two non interacting chaotic subsystems .",
    "that means , we consider the matrices @xmath6 as random gaussian , with entries @xmath7 being independent and identically distributed variables with mean zero and variances @xmath8 for the gue case ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 for goe case ( @xmath11 ) . the joint probability density for @xmath6 is then written as [ probdh]()=c^_n\\{- tr^2},where @xmath12 is the appropriate normalization constant .",
    "we introduce an interaction between blocks @xmath4 by considering a general coupling matrix @xmath13 .",
    "we assume here that @xmath14 have the same symmetry properties as the diagonal blocks @xmath4 and their probability densities can be written as [ prob - jb ] ( _ p)\\{-tr_p^2}.as for the off - diagonal blocks @xmath15 , they represent general gaussian random matrices ( complex for @xmath9 or real for @xmath11 ) with no further symmetry constraints are imposed .",
    "the probability density for @xmath15 is then chosen for both cases to be [ probdv]()\\{-tr^}.    models of this kind were previously employed with satisfactory results in the analysis of data relative to symmetry breaking in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "denote the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath6 by @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath17 this implies that @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our main goal is to find the distribution of level curvatures , defined as the second order derivative of eigenvalues of @xmath0 with respect to the perturbation parameter @xmath1 .",
    "employing in the usual way the second order perturbation theory we can write the expression for the curvature corresponding , say , to an eigenvalue that for @xmath21 coincides with the ( unperturbed ) eigenvalue @xmath22 as : [ eq - l1i2 ] _ i=_ki^n + _ k=1^n.this expression shows that there are generically two contributions to the level curvatures .",
    "the first sum is essentially the level curvature induced by the _ block - diagonal _ part of the perturbation which does not lead to any mixing between levels of the two non - interacting subsystems . taken alone , this term ( which we will denote here as @xmath23 ) must",
    ", therefore , yield the zakrzewski - delande curvature distribution .",
    "in contrast , the second sum that will be denoted as @xmath24 reflects the influence of the off - diagonal perturbation , which mixes the levels of two subsystems .",

    "we further use [ tr]tr(^)=(*v*^_i1*v*_i1)_k_k z_(*v*^_k2*v*_2),and recall that @xmath33 are eigenvectors of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are those of @xmath36 . using the orthogonality of the eigenvectors : @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",

    "the distribution shows a power law tail , the gue - like behaviour @xmath158 being replaced by the cauchy - lorentz one @xmath159 with the relative growth of the ratio @xmath156 . for any @xmath160 the most distant tail is always of the cauchy - lorentz type , but intermediate gue - like behaviour is clearly seen for @xmath161 when intra - subsystem coupling appreciably exceeds the inter - subsystem one . the crossover curvature value between the two regimes of decay is approximately described by the expression [ cc ] _ cr(+ ) , which can be obtained by equating the large - curvature tails originating from the two competing terms in the expression eq.([curfin - red ] ) . for curvatures in the interval @xmath162 ,",
    "the behaviour is gue - like , changing to a slower cauchy - lorentz decay at @xmath163 .",
    "it is also easy to verify that the maximal value of the distribution @xmath164 always decreases with the increasing ratio [ peak ] ( 0)=      we plot this distribution superimposed over the numerical data for various values of @xmath156 .",
    "again , they agree rather well with the numerics and a crossover behaviour from goe - like tail to cauchy - lorentz one can be seen clearly for small @xmath156 , e.g. @xmath166 .",
    "in fact , one may notice from our plots that decrease in maximal value of the distribution starts to be noticeable at much smaller values of @xmath156 than the modification of tail behaviour at not very large values of @xmath150 .",
    "this fact qualitatively corroborates with the experimental observations in quartz blocks @xcite , where noticeable deviations were detected in the center of the distribution , whereas the tails agreed well .",
    "although , our oversimplified model clearly can not be considered as adequate for describing the actual experimental situation , we nevertheless mention that the choice of @xmath167 allows matching the drop of the peak value with the experimentally observed deviation and produces an overall good agreement with the experimental curve .    as we already noted in the text of the paper , and as clearly seen from the numerical log - log plots , the limiting large @xmath168 curvature distribution due to purely off - diagonal ( inter - subsystem ) perturbations turned out to have the same cauchy - lorentz form irrespective of the underlying symmetry , for both @xmath9 and @xmath11 . below",
    "we give an alternative , heuristic derivation of this fact , which sheds some light on the origin of such a behaviour .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is expression eq.([av - v ] ) for @xmath9 or eq.([av - vo ] ) for @xmath11 .",
    "denoting @xmath169 , as in the text above , we rewrite those formulas as : [ av - v1 ] _ k=1^n ^ _ _ 2= _ k=1^n^ _ _ 2 + = \\{_k=1^n } _ _ 2 _ _ 2 . at the last step we made a plausible assumption that the expression above in the limit of large @xmath43 can be approximated by expanding the logarithms in the exponential to the first non - vanishing term .",
    "now we introduce an _ exact _ eigenvalue density for @xmath36 as : [ dos ] ( ) = _ k=1^n(-_2,k ) , where @xmath170 stands for the dirac delta function . in terms of this density the ensemble average ( [ av - v1 ] ) can be rewritten as : [ av ] \\{-id ( ) } _ _ 2 .",
    "now , we use the well - known fact that the exact eigenvalue density for random matrices is _ self - averaging _ , which means in the limit @xmath171 converges to a _ non - random _ smooth function -the mean eigenvalue density . the latter function is just given by the wigner semicircular law @xmath172 for @xmath173 , where @xmath174 for gue and @xmath175 for goe .",
    "all these facts suggest that in the limit of large @xmath43 the ensemble average in ( [ av ] ) can be suppressed in favour of replacing the exact density with its semicircular form .",
    "moreover , since @xmath176 is a smooth function , in the limit of @xmath177 we can use the sohotsky formula : [ sohotsky ] _",
    "n_-_sc^_sc d_sc ( ) = p_-_sc^_sc d_sc()-isgn[]_sc ( ) , where the first term is understood as a principal value integral , and @xmath178 stands for the sign function of the argument .",
    "in fact , with some effort the integral can be evaluated explicitly : [ exp - int ] _",
    "-_sc^_sc d=2.collecting all terms we see that : [ scs ] .^/2 |_n=\\{- } , which coincides with the earlier derived expressions in eq.([x>0 ] ) and in eq.([1x>0 ] ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that such a derivation can be made mathematically rigorous .",
    "however , despite its simplicity and conceptual clarity , such a method can not be straightforwardly applied to evaluation of the more complicated averages such as those in eqs.([av1-wth ] ) and ( [ avo - wth1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the application of the outlined procedure to eq.([av1-wth ] ) amounts to approximating the extra determinant factor in the large - n limit as : [ large - lim ] ^2(_n - h_2)\\{2n_-_sc^_sc d}= e^,which is indeed a correct expression up to the _ leading _ order in @xmath43 in the exponential .",
    "it serves to cancel the extra factor @xmath179 in front of the ensemble average in eq.([av1-wth ] ) .",
    "however , it is easy to understand that to arrive to the correct expression eq.([avo - wth ] ) one needs to take into account _ subleading _",
    "terms -those of the order of unity in the exponential .",
    "this goal goes beyond the simple use of self - averaging , and requires a much more detailed treatment .",
    "it is not clear at the moment how to implement such a treatment in the present heuristic scheme .",
    "that is why the  supersymmetrization \" method , which yields fully controllable results in all cases should be in general preferred .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have derived exact expressions for the distribution of level curvatures in a model describing a mixing of two independent spectra by a generic perturbation .",
    "although the model is too simple to describe actual experimental situation in systems with partially broken symmetries , some features of the behaviour of our curvature distribution may play a role of useful analogy helping to understand the deviations in experimentally measured level curvature distribution of the acoustic resonances of quartz blocks @xcite .",
    "indeed , the maximum value of the latter distribution was found to be considerably lower than predicted for pure goe case , whereas the tail shows good @xmath180 decay .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with our observation that the peak value of the curvature distribution might be more sensitive to remnant symmetries than the power law tail behaviour .",
    "in fact , an ideal experimental realisation of our model may be the system of two superconduction microwave billiards coupled by an antenna in a variable way @xcite .",
    "although , in real experiments of this type the coupling was changed in large discrete increments , it is in principle possible to change it in a much more controllable way , and to study level dynamics induced by such a coupling .",
    "we hope that our results may stimulate experiments of this sort .",
