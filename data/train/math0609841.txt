    "in this paper we develop a method for calculating equivariant volumes of non - compact symplectic spaces ( where they are also known as _ regularized volumes _ ) equipped with a hamiltonian action of a torus @xmath1 , in the case when these spaces are finite - dimensional symplectic reductions or hyper - khler quotients .",
    "the hamiltonian action gives a moment map @xmath2 , and we are interested in the improper integrals @xmath3 of the function @xmath4 with respect to the liouville measure @xmath5 . under certain conditions",
    "this integral converges for @xmath6 in an open subset of the lie algebra @xmath7 .",
    "formally we may write it as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a class in a completion of the equivariant cohomology ring @xmath10 . because @xmath11 is not compact ,",
    "however , the integral of this class can not be directly defined cohomologically .",
    "the method described here is essentially a combination of the symplectic cut of lerman  @xcite and the jeffrey - kirwan residue formula of non - abelian localization  @xcite .",
    "the symplectic cut allows us to reduce the integral to an integral over a compact space @xmath12 , such that the original integral is recovered in the limit as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "once in the compact setting , the residue formulas ( which require compactness ) allow the integral over the quotient to be expressed in terms of equivariant data on the space that one takes the quotient of .",
    "the key observation is that the cutting operation introduces new fixed points ` at infinity ' , whose contribution is crucial .    in the particular case of symplectic reductions or hyper - khler quotients of vector spaces by linear actions , we are able to describe the outcome of this procedure in greater detail , and express the corresponding volumes as iterated residues of a single rational function . for hyper - khler quotients for instance we have @xmath14 in the rational function @xmath15 in question , @xmath16 is the product of the positive roots of @xmath17 , and both @xmath18 and the denominator are products of linear factors entirely determined by the action of @xmath17 on @xmath19 .",
    "the iterated residue @xmath20 extracts the relevant information out of the rational function ; its definition is given in section  [ linact ] .",
    "our motivating examples come from physics : the equivariant volumes of moduli spaces of framed instantons , which are the main ingredient in the recent instanton counting of nekrasov  @xcite .",
    "the famous adhm construction  @xcite realizes these spaces as hyper - khler quotients , and using this we completely carry out the calculational strategy described below for them .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we interpret the integrals we study as _ regularized volumes _ @xmath21 , i.e. bona fide improper integrals , firmly rooted in symplectic geometry , which is true to the initial formulation of the problem of instanton counting in physics .",
    "this is somewhat in contrast to other authors  @xcite , who work with a formal integral @xmath22 in equivariant cohomology of the class 1 , essentially defined through a localization formula . from our more naive point of view ,",
    "all localization formulas are theorems rather than definitions , and more importantly for us , this perspective allows for our calculational method , as the moment map gives the exact recipe for handling the residues of the new fixed points introduced by the cut .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ pw ]",
    "we discuss the basic object of our study , the regularized volumes of non - compact symplectic spaces with hamiltonian torus action , and review the prato - wu theorem that calculates their volume . in section  [ basisidee ]",
    "we discuss the jeffrey - kirwan residue theorem , and develop our main conceptual idea , combining the residue theorem with symplectic cutting to calculate the equivariant volume of quotients .",
    "in section  [ linact ] we specialize to _ linear _ symplectic reductions and hyper - khler quotients , and discuss the specific implementation of our calculational method in these cases .",
    "as examples of this calculational method we implement it in section  [ nstntn ] for the adhm spaces for the classical gauge groups , and compare the results with the work of nekrasov - shadchin  @xcite whose formulas we rederive .",
    "we will use the following notation throughout : @xmath23      i would like to thank lisa jeffrey , mikhail kogan , nikita nekrasov , michle vergne and peter woit for useful conversations . the bulk of the work presented here was done while i was a graduate student at columbia university , and i would like to thank my advisor michael thaddeus for continuous guidance and encouragement , as well as a careful reading of the final version of this article .",
    "finally i would like to add that this work was largely inspired by reading the early paper  @xcite .",
    "this article was partially written during a stay at the max - planck - institut fr mathematik , bonn , whose hospitality and support is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the famous formula of duistermaat - heckman  @xcite establishes an expression for the integral of the _ equivariant volume _ of a compact symplectic manifold @xmath24 equipped with a hamiltonian action of a torus @xmath1 with moment map @xmath25 : @xmath26 where the sum in the right hand side is over the connected components of the fixed point set for the action of @xmath1 , @xmath27 is the normal bundle of @xmath28 in @xmath11 , and @xmath29 is its equivariant euler class . in",
    "@xcite this formula was established as a particular instance of localization in equivariant cohomology , using the cartan model . in  @xcite , this theorem is discussed in the case where @xmath11 is no longer compact :    let @xmath24 be a ( non - compact ) symplectic manifold equipped with a hamiltonian action of a torus @xmath1 . if the fixed - point set @xmath30 is compact and there exists a @xmath31 such that the corresponding component of the moment map @xmath32 is proper and bounded on one side ( assume bounded above ) then the duistermaat - heckman formula @xmath33 still holds true , provided one interprets the right - hand side as the integral of the function @xmath34 with respect to the measure induced by the liouville volume @xmath35 , and one restricts oneself to @xmath6 inside of an certain open cone @xmath36 .",
    "the open cone occurring in the theorem is exactly the set of all @xmath6 for which the integral in the left hand side of ( [ pwform ] ) converges .",
    "the right - hand side can now be interpreted as a function on @xmath7 with poles on an arrangement of hyperplanes containing the origin , and the cone used is contained in a component of the complement of the hyperplanes .",
    "one can prove this theorem by means of the _ symplectic cut _ construction introduced by lerman  @xcite : the conditions stated above guarantee the existence of a circle @xmath37 in @xmath1 whose moment map @xmath38 is proper and bounded above , hence the symplectic cut @xmath39 with respect to this circle is a compact symplectic space , still equipped with a @xmath1-action . as the open dense subset inherits its symplectic structure from the inclusion of @xmath40 in @xmath11 , one can moreover recover the integral over @xmath11 we are interested in as the limit of integrals over the symplectic cuts : @xmath41 for the compact spaces @xmath12 the original duistermaat - heckman formula holds , and as @xmath42 is assumed to be compact , one can remark that the fixed point set @xmath43 , for @xmath13 large enough , consists of the ` original ' fixed point components of @xmath11 , together with ` new ' ones introduced by the cut : @xmath44 as the components of @xmath30 do nt depend on @xmath13 , ( [ blah ] ) becomes @xmath45 moreover , in the limit as @xmath46 , one can easily show that the contributions of the new fixed points ( i.e. the @xmath1-fixed points of @xmath47 ) will vanish , @xmath48 provided that one exactly restricts to values of @xmath6 in the open cone @xmath49 , which establishes ( [ pwform ] ) .",
    "indeed , the values of any new fixed - point component @xmath28 under the moment map @xmath25 will vary with the parameter @xmath13 , and the cone @xmath49 is such that the exponent of @xmath50 is negative .",
    "it was pointed out to the author by m. vergne that the original proof of @xcite essentially follows this line , although the technology of symplectic cuts had not been introduced at the time .    in @xcite",
    ", paradan discusses the above formula in the much broader setting of equivariant cohomology with generalized coefficients . for our purposes",
    "the naive interpretation given above suffices however , and we will restrict ourselves to this framework .",
    "in this section we describe the main idea of this paper : in order to calculate the equivariant volume of a non - compact quotient @xmath51 , compactify both @xmath11 and @xmath51 by a symplectic cut , use a residue formula to calculate the volume of the cut of @xmath51 , and recover the result in the limit .",
    "kirwan showed in  @xcite that for the symplectic reduction of a compact symplectic space @xmath24 by a compact connected lie group @xmath52 there is a surjective map , the _ kirwan map _",
    ", @xmath53 in  @xcite jeffrey and kirwan established a method for calculating integrals over @xmath51 of images of this map , by means of the residue formula instead of @xmath54 as the equivariant symplectic form",
    ". we will follow the version given in  @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the residue formula where given in  @xcite . ] :    [ lisafrances ] @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a maximal torus of @xmath17 , @xmath57 is the constant @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the number of positive roots , the volume @xmath60 is taken with respect to an invariant metric on @xmath56 , @xmath61 is the weyl group of @xmath17 , @xmath16 is the product of the positive roots of @xmath17 , @xmath62 is the inclusion @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the jeffrey - kirwan residue operation .",
    "the residue @xmath64 is a linear operation defined on a class of meromorphic forms on a vector space , with poles on an arrangement of hyperplanes ( i.e. the denominator has to split as a product of linear factors ) .",
    "the residue depends on the choice of a cone @xmath65 ; for different choices of @xmath66 the residue will affect the terms in the right hand side differently , but the total result is independent of the choice for @xmath66 .",
    "the original definition of the residue was given in terms of formal fourier transforms , and a characterizing list of axioms was determined in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 8.11 ) .",
    "another intrinsic formulation of the residue was given in  @xcite .",
    "we will however restrict ourselves to using another definition of the residue , given in  @xcite , as iterated one dimensional residues .",
    "begin by looking at the one - dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath67 be a function on @xmath68 of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 are rational functions on @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . then define the residue of the @xmath73-form @xmath74 to be",
    "@xmath75 this one - dimensional residue will be the building block for defining higher - dimensional versions . a very useful little fact that we shall use often later on",
    "is : if @xmath76 are polynomials on @xmath7 such that @xmath77 , then @xmath78 as can easily be seen by interpreting this rational form as a rational form on @xmath79 , calculating @xmath80 by using the cauchy theorem , and looking at the residue at @xmath81 .",
    "now the higher - dimensional version that we want to use is in practice obtained by iterating such one - dimensional residues @xmath80 .",
    "suppose @xmath82 is a linear coordinate system on @xmath83 .",
    "then for any function given as a sum of terms of the form @xmath84 with @xmath85 a polynomial on @xmath7 , and @xmath86 , we can still define one - dimensional residues @xmath87 for any of the given coordinates , by treating all other coordinates as generic constants .",
    "the result of this is a new function of the form([goeiefunctie ] ) , but this time only in the remaining variables @xmath88 .",
    "we then follow  @xcite in defining the residue operation @xmath64 inductively as an iterated residue : @xmath89 ) = \\triangle{\\text{jkres}}^+_{x_1}\\ldots { \\text{jkres}}^+_{x_n}h(x_1,\\ldots , x_n ) [ dx]_1^n \\end{split}\\ ] ] for any generic coordinate system @xmath90 such that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the determinant of any @xmath93 matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis of @xmath83 defining the same orientation as @xmath94 ( a metric on @xmath83 is tacitly understood ) .",
    "different choices for @xmath66 will give different results when applying @xmath64 to the summands in the rhs of ( [ jefkir ] ) , but the total result will be unaffected",
    ". in general @xmath64 will only give a non - zero contribution for the summands corresponding to components @xmath95 where @xmath96 , the dual cone of @xmath66 . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that this definition of @xmath64 coincides with the earlier one given in terms of a fourier transform .    as indicated above the residue operation",
    "acts on meromorphic forms rather than functions , but for notational convenience we will suppress the relevant form part @xmath97_1^n$ ] throughout .",
    "we want to apply theorem  [ lisafrances ] for the calculation of equivariant volumes of non - compact spaces that arise as symplectic reductions , in the sense described in section  [ pw ] .",
    "we will take the same approach as the one outlined above for the theorem of prato - wu in ( [ blah ] ) : one can relate the integral on the non - compact space to a limit of integrals on compact spaces by means of varying symplectic cuts , and then use the available residue theorems for the compact spaces . in sharp contrast",
    "however with the theorem of prato - wu is that the contributions of the ` new ' fixed points introduced by the cuts will not vanish in the limit .",
    "in fact , in the cases that we study later on , these ` fixed points at infinity ' carry all the information .    in order to implement this we need the following straightforward equivariant generalization of the jeffrey - kirwan theorem :    [ equijk ] let @xmath17 and @xmath98 be two ( compact , connected ) lie groups with commuting hamiltonian actions on a compact symplectic manifold @xmath24 .",
    "then the action of @xmath98 descends to the symplectic reduction @xmath51 , and with the equivariant kirwan map @xmath99 and the notation as in theorem  [ lisafrances ] we have @xmath100    as our proof of this is a fairly straightforward reduction of the equivariant to the non - equivariant @xmath101 case and mainly consists of technical remarks , we postpone it to appendix  [ appen ] .",
    "now suppose that we have two commuting hamiltonian group actions on a symplectic manifold @xmath24 , of a compact connected lie group @xmath17 and a torus @xmath1 with moment maps @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and suppose that @xmath103 has a component that is proper and bounded from below .",
    "then , as before , we can find a circle in @xmath1 such that the symplectic cuts of both @xmath11 and @xmath51 with respect to this circle are compact .",
    "moreover , since all group actions commute and a symplectic cut is a symplectic reduction at heart , we have @xmath104 .",
    "if we express the equivariant volume of the reduced space @xmath51 as the limit of the equivariant volumes of the cut spaces @xmath105 , the equivariant residue formula allows us to calculate the equivariant volumes of @xmath51 as    @xmath106    one now has to make the basic but important observation that the symplectic cut introduces new fixed points  under the conditions stated above we have , for large @xmath13 , @xmath107 furthermore , when considering the limit as @xmath108 we restrict ourselves to the open cone in @xmath7 as in section  [ pw ] . on this open cone",
    "the limit of most  but not all  of the terms given by the residue formula vanishes .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the physical concept of renormalization for quantum field theories : we have introduced a ` scale ' ( the momentum cut @xmath13 ) , but it turns out that there are quantities independent of the scale , and those are the ones that survive the limit as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "we further remark that for our purposes , we shall use theorem  [ equijk ] in the case where the second group @xmath109 is a torus . in this situation ,",
    "the integrals over the fixed point components are integrals in @xmath1-equivariant cohomology that we can calculate via the usual localization .",
    "therefore we can actually replace the sum on the right - hand side with the sum over all the @xmath110-fixed point components @xmath111 .",
    "let us illustrate this principle in the simplest possible case : the equivariant integral on @xmath112 with respect to a circle @xmath113 acting linearly with weight two .",
    "this is nothing but a gaussian integral , which can be calculated using the prato - wu theorem @xmath114where the right - hand side is the contribution of the unique fixed point to the localization formula .",
    "this result needs to be interpret as holding only on the open cone @xmath115 in @xmath116 , or if preferred on the cone @xmath117 in the complexification @xmath7 . indeed",
    ", if we would follow the reasoning of equation  ( [ cmp ] ) and compactify @xmath118 through a symplectic cut to obtain @xmath119 , then this cut would introduce a single extra fixed point , with contribution @xmath120 . in the limit @xmath121 , the contribution of this fixed point ` at infinity ' would vanish for @xmath122 or @xmath117 .",
    "alternatively , we can construct @xmath118 as well as the reduction of @xmath123 by the action of a circle @xmath124 acting with weights @xmath73 and @xmath125 : @xmath126 the action of @xmath98 lifts to @xmath11 as well , by @xmath127 we can depict the images under the moment maps of @xmath11 and @xmath12 as in figure  [ voorbeeldje ] .",
    "after making the cut @xmath128 and using affine coordinates for @xmath129 and projective coordinates for @xmath79 , it is easy to see that there are three fixed points in @xmath12 : the original @xmath130 in @xmath11 , and the two new fixed points , ` at infinity ' , @xmath131 $ ] and @xmath132 $ ] . for the calculation of the residue",
    ", we only need to take @xmath131 $ ] into account , as the residues of the contributions of the other fixed points give zero .",
    "the weights of the isotropy representation of @xmath1 on its tangent space are directly read off from figure  [ voorbeeldje ] : @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "hence we get as an integral : @xmath135 the reason only one of the two terms given by the residue survives the limit as @xmath46 is exactly that the cone on which we consider the outcome ( namely @xmath115 or @xmath117 ) is such that every exponential that still occurs vanishes .",
    "in order to put the above idea to use , one must have a way of handling the limit of the residues as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves from now on to symplectic reductions and hyper - khler quotients of vector spaces by linear group actions , where this becomes feasible .",
    "we first need some remarks about how we interpret the symplectic cut for hyper - khler quotients",
    ".      we will be interested in applying this philosophy to calculate equivariant volumes of hyper - khler quotients of a vector space @xmath19 by a linear group action , @xmath136 however , we will not be interested in the full hyper - khler structure , but rather in the symplectic structure induced by one of the complex structures . with a choice of a preferred complex structure we can single out the moment map @xmath137 associated with the corresponding khler form , and pack the ` other ' moment maps together in a complex valued @xmath138 .",
    "we will therefore mainly think of the hyper - khler quotients as symplectic reductions of a level set of this complex moment map : @xmath139 the torus actions of @xmath1 on @xmath19 that we will consider do not preserve the hyper - khler structure , but as @xmath140 is ( quadratic ) homogeneous it will preserve the variety @xmath141 and therefore it will descend to an action on @xmath142 .    now in order to apply the calculational scheme outlined above , we need to study the symplectic cut @xmath143 .",
    "our calculations become much simpler , however , if we remark here that this symplectic cut , a subspace of @xmath144 , can still be interpreted as a zero - set of a section of a vector bundle . indeed , in the cases studied later on , the symplectic cut happens with respect to a circle acting with global weight , and hence the cut space @xmath144 is a projective space .",
    "as @xmath140 is quadratic , we can therefore associate with it an equivariant section of the @xmath1-equivariant bundle @xmath145 over the projective space @xmath144 , which we will also denote as @xmath140 : @xmath146\\\\ \\ \\\\ v_{\\lambda}\\ar@/^1.5pc/[uu ] ^{\\mu_{{\\mathbb{c } } } } } \\ ] ] by further abuse of notation we will say that @xmath147 this allows us now to reduce integration over @xmath148 to integration over @xmath149 , by using the ( equivariant ) euler class of the bundle as equivariant poincar dual to this zero - set . strictly speaking there is no poincar duality in equivariant cohomology , but one still has the property that @xmath150 for a sufficiently general ) that the zero - level of the complex moment map for adhm spaces is a complete intersection . ] section @xmath151 of an equivariant bundle @xmath152 over a compact @xmath11 , see e.g.  @xcite . hence we can adapt the calculational method given above in  ( [ master ] ) to the case of hyper - khler quotients of vector spaces : @xmath153    we have been conspicuously silent about an important aspect of this method : the possibility that the quotient @xmath51 or @xmath154 is singular .",
    "( the simple example discussed in section  [ basex ] above was a particular case where a reduction at a singular value of the moment map was nevertheless smooth . ) in essence , everything still goes through , and we postpone the discussion about this to section  [ nstntn ] .      since in practice most , if not all , finite - dimensional hyper - khler quotients are quotients of vector spaces by linear group actions",
    ", we will now restrict ourself to those cases .",
    "for these , as outlined above , we need a circle inside @xmath1 that acts with a single global weight , and hence the cut space @xmath144 will be a projective space @xmath155 .",
    "as all the fixed point data in this projective space are determined by the representation of @xmath110 on @xmath19 , we can expect a more direct approach that bypasses the procedure of making the cut to compactify , examining the fixed points on the cut locus @xmath156 and their residues , and then taking the limit @xmath108 .",
    "indeed this is the case , and below we give a description for the outcome that no longer mentions the cut .",
    "we will take a shamelessly pragmatic approach , explicitly using coordinates and working with a residue operation defined through iterated one - dimensional residues as in ( [ beupf ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that all relevant ( i.e. whose residue is not manifestly zero ) @xmath157 fixed points on @xmath144 are isolated  which is the case for all the examples we will discuss below .",
    "we will use the following notation : for a meromorphic function @xmath158 expressed in linear coordinates @xmath94 and with all @xmath159 linear , denote by @xmath160 the meromorphic function in the variables @xmath161 obtained by taking the residue in the variable @xmath162 of the pole determined by the @xmath163-th factor in the denominator ( and meanwhile considering all other variables as generic constants ) .",
    "the new form lacks a @xmath163-th factor in the denominator , but for convenience we keep the same name and labelling of factors ( i.e. the index skips @xmath163 ) . as an example we have @xmath164",
    "now , let us examine how to implement the above calculational method ( [ ideetje ] ) when we have a ( compact connected ) lie group @xmath17 with maximal torus @xmath56 which acts tri - hamiltonianly on a hyper - khler vector space @xmath19 , with complex moment map @xmath140 .",
    "( everything below still goes through if @xmath19 is just a complex vector space of which we want to take a symplectic reduction , by just dropping the extra factors coming from @xmath140 throughout . )",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is further equipped with the action of a torus @xmath1 , commuting with @xmath17 , such that @xmath1 contains a circle acting with global weight one .",
    "let @xmath159 be the weights ( repeated in the case of multiplicities ) occurring in the weight decomposition of the torus action of @xmath157 on @xmath19 .",
    "clearly the ` new ' fixed point components of the cut space in @xmath165 will correspond exactly to weight spaces @xmath166 for some @xmath167 . with the assumption of isolated fixed points made above",
    ", the relevant such weights will have multiplicity one , and the image under the moment map @xmath168 of such an isolated fixed point of @xmath144 will be @xmath169 .",
    "one can also easily see that the weights of the isotropy representation at the fixed point corresponding to the weight @xmath159 are given by @xmath170 .",
    "we will further abuse notation by writing the equivariant euler class of the bundle ( [ lim ] ) , of which the complex moment map is a section , at the fixed point @xmath171 as @xmath18 as well ( this is also a polynomial , a product of linear factors ) , and at the fixed point determined by @xmath159 as @xmath172 .",
    "let us examine the contributions of such a fixed - point component to the formula given above .",
    "clearly the iterated residue @xmath64 ( [ beupf ] ) gives rise to a sum of terms , each of which is obtained by taking the residue at one pole for each variable @xmath162 on @xmath173 : @xmath174 calculating ( [ sommeke ] ) in practice comes down to determining exactly which iterated residues need to be included in the right - hand side . for each term in the right - hand side of ( [ sommeke ] )",
    "we can indicate which poles were chosen for which variables by a path @xmath175 as in figure  [ admispath ] , and denote this by @xmath176 .",
    "as taking the residue at a pole eliminates that pole , each path can only contain every pole at most once , but certainly this is not a sufficient condition .",
    "let us examine more closely which paths can occur in the sum ( [ sommeke ] ) .",
    "recall from ( [ bijna2 ] ) the definition of the one - dimensional residue @xmath177 iterating this gives the condition that just before taking the residue for the @xmath178 variable determined by the path , the coefficient of the @xmath179 variable of the exponent has to be positive , and this holds for all @xmath163 .",
    "let us call this condition a.    furthermore , we are only interested in the terms that survive the limit @xmath108 ( as always , only considering the answer as a function on an open cone in @xmath173 ) . in order for there to be any term that survives the limit , the last pole that is evaluated has to be the @xmath167-th one , so our path has to end at the @xmath167-th vertex in the right - most column . call this condition b. indeed , if the @xmath167-th pole occurs sooner in the path , the next step in the full iterated residue @xmath64 clearly yields zero .",
    "likewise , if the @xmath167-th pole is never used in a residue coming from a path , the term corresponding to that path would still have a non - zero coefficient in the exponent , and the cone in the lie algebra on which we evaluate the final result is such that in the limit @xmath108 the term would vanish .",
    "let us call a path satisfying both these conditions a and b an _ admissible path_. hence we have @xmath180      from the above it is clear that in practice calculating the residue @xmath64 boils down to determining which paths @xmath175 are admissible , and calculating the corresponding contribution @xmath181 for each admissible path @xmath175 ending at @xmath182 .",
    "let us use the following notation : given a linear form @xmath183 and a choice of ( linear ) coordinates @xmath94 on a vector space , we say that @xmath184 if the @xmath178 coefficient of @xmath183 is greater than @xmath171 . with this notation",
    ", we can state the conditions for a path to be admissible as follows : first , we need to verify that @xmath185 . after taking the residue in the @xmath186 variable at the pole determined by @xmath187 , we then want @xmath188 , and this keeps repeating until variable @xmath189 .",
    "in particular , when testing if a path is admissible , this requires at each step calculating @xmath190 before we can determine if the vertex @xmath191 can be part of the path , which is quite inefficient .    using some elementary linear algebra , however",
    ", we can reshuffle the calculations for contributions of admissible paths in such a way that we gain two distinct advantages .",
    "firstly , the conditions for a path to be admissible become more straightforward .",
    "secondly , we can apply the iterated residues corresponding to all admissible paths _ to the same single function _ , irrespective of the vertex at which the paths end ( i.e.  the fixed point to whose contribution the term belongs ) .",
    "hence we eliminate referring to the actual ` fixed points at infinity ' , as we directly extract their contributions from one single function .",
    "a path @xmath192 giving rise to the term @xmath193 in the contribution of the fixed point corresponding to the weight @xmath159 is admissible if and only if we have at the beginning @xmath194 and then at each step @xmath195 .",
    "furthermore , its contribution can also be computed as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the path @xmath198 .    for the first statement",
    "it suffices to remark the following .",
    "we each time want to test the function @xmath159 in the exponent after consecutive residues : @xmath199 .",
    "however the poles at which we take the consecutive residues are exactly @xmath200 .",
    "as taking a residue at such a pole essentially sets that term to zero , we might as well test for @xmath201 .",
    "for the second statement , notice that calculating one - dimensional residues @xmath202 can essentially be understood in terms of elementary linear algebra as gaussian elimination for a matrix . indeed , if you organize all the occurring linear functions ( expressed in coordinates ) as rows in a matrix as follows : @xmath203 & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "the factor of the pivotal entry is all that remains of the row used .    from this one",
    "immediately sees that taking the consecutive one - dimensional residues comes down to doing row - reduction for the first @xmath204 rows , replacing the remaining factors in the original function by the corresponding new rows , and dividing the function by the determinant of the upper @xmath205 submatrix in the above matrix . with this in mind",
    "it is now clear that one can in fact change the ordering of the poles used for the consecutive residues , as well as the ordering of the variables used , with the sign change that occurs through the determinant as the only penalty .",
    "the single condition that needs to be satisfied is that for the new ordering , all the pivotal elements need to be non - zero .",
    "now , given our ordering of the poles ( i.e. @xmath206 ) , change the ordering by making the last pole used first ( hence obtaining @xmath207 ) . as we have used @xmath208 for the first pole",
    ", this immediately implies that we might as well change all the other factors ( i.e. @xmath209 as well as @xmath210 ) to the corresponding factors ( i.e. @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) for the ` central function ' @xmath15 .",
    "this ordering also has the advantage that it exactly corresponds to the ordering of the testing explained above , and furthermore the consecutive conditions that the pivotal elements are non - zero is indeed implied through the consecutive tests @xmath213 .",
    "with this it makes sense to define the following :    let @xmath214 be a choice of linear coordinates on a complex vector space @xmath19 . then for any rational function @xmath215 on @xmath19 , where @xmath216 , and where each @xmath217 comes with a preferred polarization , we define @xmath218 inductively as @xmath219 where in each step the other variables are treated as generic constants , and where the single - variable residues are defined as @xmath220 @xmath217 in the sum on the right hand side being the factors of @xmath221 .    with this definition",
    "we now can summarize the discussion of this section :    let a compact connected lie group @xmath17 act tri - hamiltonianly on a hyper - khler vector space @xmath19 , such that the group action commutes with the action of a torus @xmath1 .",
    "assume that @xmath1 acts hamiltonianly with respect to one of the khler structures on @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath222 and @xmath223 denote the corresponding khler form and moment map on the hyper - khler quotient @xmath154 .",
    "then with the notation as above we have @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the constant @xmath226 .",
    "here @xmath227 is a linear coordinate system on the lie algebra of @xmath17 , suitable in the sense of ( [ beupf ] ) . for the volume of a symplectic reduction of a vector space with a linear action ,",
    "the formula is identical except that @xmath18 is missing .",
    "we remark here the difference in the definitions of the various residue operations : @xmath64 and the one - dimensional @xmath228 on the one side , and @xmath218 on the other .",
    "the former , originally coming from a fourier - transform , involve a positivity test for the coefficient in the exponent of the numerator ( hence the choice of the position of @xmath66 and @xmath229 in the notation ) .",
    "the latter involves a test of positivity on the factors of the denominator .",
    "the advantage of the reordering of the poles is that in practice it offers an easier way to go through the calculations of residues : at each step ( i.e.  when taking the residue for each successive variable ) just take the sum of the residues at the poles corresponding to factors where the variable has a positive coefficient .",
    "we remark that the way we have written the residue above does not simply apply to rational functions  in particular each factor in the denominator has to come with a preferred sign , which is similar to the choice of polarization used in the guillemin - lerman - sternberg approach to the duistermaat - heckman formula  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will use this result further to compare our calculational method with the one given by nekrasov and shadchin  @xcite in the physics literature .",
    "we are now ready to apply the calculational techniques described above to our guiding examples : the calculation of the equivariant volumes of the adhm spaces as they occur in instanton counting .",
    "we discuss the corresponding residue formulas , both for their own sake and as examples of how to implement the calculational heuristic given above in various settings , and rederive the results of nekrasov and shadchin  @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect still requiring settlement is the matter of the singularities of the quotients .      the recent work regarding instanton counting  @xcite is a direct answer to an open problem in physics . in particular ,",
    "it is concerned with @xmath230 supersymmetric quantum yang - mills theory .",
    "one now wants to describe the low - energy behavior of this theory , and using the ideas of the wilson renormalization group , one finds that this low - energy limit is described by means of another action , the _ effective action_. in general it is extremely difficult to explicitly write down the effective lagrangian .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath230 quantum yang - mills theory it was shown by seiberg and witten in the seminal  @xcite that the entire lagrangian for the low energy effective theory is determined by a single ( multivalued ) holomorphic function @xmath231 , the seiberg - witten prepotential .",
    "furthermore , using an assumption that a form of electric - magnetic duality ( called montonen - olive duality ) holds for the quantum theory , seiberg and witten managed to describe this prepotential analytically , in terms of period integrals of a family of curves .",
    "their work was a major breakthrough in physics , but led to spectacular advances in mathematics as well , in particular in the framework of the seiberg - witten invariants in differential geometry .",
    "the original work of seiberg and witten was based on an assumption of duality , and though this duality is widely believed to hold , it is conjectural even for physicists as no derivation from first principles is known . in the last 10 years",
    "attempts were made to derive and verify their results directly .",
    "it was shown that this reduces to calculating certain integrals over moduli spaces of framed instantons on @xmath232 ( see e.g.  @xcite for background ) , but the actual calculations of these integrals were very difficult in general .",
    "the solution to this outstanding problem was finally accomplished by nekrasov in 2002  @xcite .",
    "the strategy nekrasov employs is to use maximal symmetry on the moduli spaces , induced by change of framing of instantons and rotations in @xmath232 , and then compute equivariant volumes with respect to this group action by means of localization techniques in equivariant cohomology .",
    "in particular nekrasov considers the following generating function also has an extra factor , @xmath233 , the _ perturbative one - loop contribution _ , which is of no concern to us . ]",

    "nekrasov argues that one can write @xmath245 as @xmath246 where the function @xmath247 is analytic and regular near @xmath248 .",
    "furthermore , he claims that @xmath249 corresponds to the instanton part of the prepotential of seiberg - witten .",
    "as the latter can be defined rigorously in terms of periods of certain families of curves , this correspondence gives rise to a remarkable conjecture in geometry . in 2003 , this conjecture was proven independently by nakajima and yoshioka  @xcite and nekrasov and okounkov  @xcite for the gauge group @xmath250 , using very different techniques . in  @xcite",
    "nekrasov and shadchin indicated how the proof of  @xcite could be adapted to the other classical gauge groups .",
    "more recently , a non - computational proof for all simple gauge groups was given by braverman and etingof in  @xcite .",

    "strictly speaking , the moduli space of framed instantons ( or , equivalently , framed rank @xmath204 holomorphic bundles on @xmath260 with second chern number @xmath236 ) is the non - singular locus of this quotient .",
    "this non - singular locus does nt satisfy the conditions to apply either the prato - wu theorem ( [ pwform ] ) or the method described above  in particular the moment map for the torus actions we are considering is not proper , due to the fact that the space is not metrically complete in the khler metric .",
    "one can however extend ( ` partially compactify ' ) these spaces in various ways : first of all , one can allow for so - called _ ideal instantons _ , which are interpreted in differential geometry as being ( framed ) connections whose curvature is concentrated at certain points .",
    "this leads to the _ uhlenbeck space _ , which is the full hyper - khler quotient : @xmath261 the uhlenbeck space is highly singular , however .",
    "a better option is to extend the non - singular locus in another way , which provides a desingularization of the uhlenbeck space .",
    "as the group @xmath257 occurring in the hyper - khler quotient has characters , we can vary the symplectic reduction or git quotient ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) by changing the value of the real moment map .",

    ", one can lift the action of @xmath274 to @xmath252 as was done in @xcite : for @xmath275 this gives @xmath276      for this torus action one can now calculate the regularized or equivariant volume of the moduli space .",
    "we remark that the original question asks for the equivariant volume of the moduli space with respect to the khler form it inherits from being included in the uhlenbeck space ( which is an affine variety ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can work with the gieseker space by pulling back the symplectic form from the uhlenbeck space to the gieseker space  so we desingularize in algebraic geometry but not in symplectic geometry .",
    "this gives a closed 2-form on @xmath264 which is degenerate on the exceptional set of @xmath277 ; on @xmath278 it is exactly the form we are concerned with .",
    "alternatively , one could think of the degenerate symplectic form as a limit of proper symplectic ( even khler ) forms that degenerate in the limit , and the regularized volume that we are interested in as the limit of the corresponding equivariant volumes for the gieseker space . despite the degeneracy , one can speak of moment maps with respect to this form . as usual , the sum of the @xmath279-form and the moment map determines a cohomology class in the cartan model of equivariant cohomology , and one can look at the localization formula for the formal exponential of this class , as was already remarked , even with the degeneracy , in  @xcite . from our viewpoint",
    ", we look at the integral of a function with respect to a volume form , and as @xmath280 has measure zero we have @xmath281    for the torus action described above , one can now give explicit descriptions of the fixed points ( which are all isolated ) , and the isotropy representations on their tangent spaces , as was done for @xmath264 in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they can be described very nicely by @xmath204-tuples of partitions @xmath282 such that @xmath283 .",
    "as all these fixed points lie above the same unique fixed point in @xmath284 under the desingularization @xmath277 , they all take the same value ( i.e.  @xmath171 ) under the moment map for the degenerate symplectic form on @xmath264 , and hence we have by the prato - wu theorem @xmath285 where the right - hand side has to be interpreted as a formal integral ( of the class @xmath73 ) defined by a localization formula .",
    "this is the viewpoint taken by several authors : the integrals that form the coefficients of the nekrasov partition function are the formal equivariant integrals of @xmath73 over the gieseker space @xmath264 .    on the other hand",
    ", we could apply the technique described in the sections above . in order to do this",
    ", however , it is very crucial that one thinks of the integral as an equivariant volume rather than the formal integral of 1 , as one now has to use the new fixed points ` at infinity ' introduced by the cut .",
    "the value of these new fixed points under the moment map will not be zero , and through the residue the geometry of the moment map gives the recipe for obtaining their contribution .",
    "from ( [ goodjobnaka ] ) we can see that the necessary condition for our cutting construction to work is clearly satisfied : there is a subgroup in @xmath286 acting with global weight @xmath73 on @xmath252 .",
    "with this lift we can now implement the calculational method described above .",
    "the resulting formula is @xmath287 where @xmath288 @xmath289 and @xmath290 where we use a maximal torus of the form @xmath291 for @xmath292 .",
    "we can now try to implement the same method to compute the regularized volumes of the moduli spaces of @xmath293 and @xmath294 instantons .",
    "we remark that for these other classical groups no equivalent of the gieseker space is known ; hence a direct localization calculation as ( [ gewloc ] ) is not available .",
    "the uhlenbeck spaces do exist here , but as before they are highly singular .",
    "we repeat that the integrals we are interested in are the indefinite integrals of a function , @xmath295 , depending on a parameter in @xmath7 with respect to a volume form @xmath5 on the non - singular locus of these uhlenbeck spaces . when implementing our method ,",
    "two minor issues need to be addressed : we need to treat the singularities differently because of this lack of a gieseker space , and the lifting of the torus action to the space of adhm data is not automatic .",
    "the adhm construction for gauge groups @xmath294 and @xmath293 was discussed in  @xcite and described in greater detail in e.g.  @xcite . in both of these cases",
    "the groups occurring by which one has to quotient are simple , and hence one can not hope to obtain a desingularization of the hyper - khler quotient by means of a variation of git quotient as was the case for the gauge group @xmath250 . however , in  @xcite , kirwan describes a method for constructing desingularizations of singular quotients @xmath51 by blowing up certain subvarieties in @xmath11 to obtain a new space @xmath296 , and then constructing the desingularization of @xmath51 as @xmath297 .",
    "one could therefore use this approach to obtain an equivariant desingularization of the uhlenbeck spaces for gauge groups @xmath294 and @xmath293 , and use these to calculate the equivariant volumes .",

    "let us illustrate this by calculating the regularized volume of the simplest hyper - khler quotient , @xmath387 , where @xmath388 acts as @xmath389 furthermore we consider a @xmath238 action on @xmath390 by @xmath391 as the complex moment map @xmath140 for the @xmath385 action is @xmath392 , the @xmath238 action indeed preserves @xmath393 , and furthermore the moment map for the @xmath238 action on @xmath390 clearly has a component that is proper and bounded below , hence all the conditions are satisfied . for the calculation according to nekrasov - shadchin",
    "we need to find the hilbert - series of @xmath394 on @xmath395 , which is @xmath396 in order to calculate the hilbert series over the quotient @xmath397 we then have to take the contour integral @xmath398 finally set @xmath399 and @xmath400 and take @xmath401 , which gives @xmath402    on the other hand , in the method we have outlined above , we can use the symplectic cut on @xmath390 with respect to the diagonal @xmath403 , which gives @xmath404 . for clarity we shall not take the calculational shortcut discussed in section  [ strat ] , but actually go through the procedure of making the symplectic cut and taking the limit as @xmath121 .",
    "there are five fixed points for the @xmath405 action on this space , of which we only need to consider @xmath406 $ ] and @xmath407 $ ] for the jeffrey - kirwan residue formula .",
    "applying this gives @xmath408 as usual , we are only interested in the terms that survive the @xmath108 limit on the open cone of @xmath409 ; hence for each of the two above terms we only need to consider the residue at the pole that cancels the exponent , which gives the exact same expression as ( [ nekras ] ) .",
    "on could essentially try to adapt any proof of theorem  [ equijk ] to the equivariant setting . the approach we take here is almost completely based on  @xcite , and we restrict ourselves to commenting on how to adjust it .",
    "we can break up the proof in two steps : first reduce the case where @xmath17 is a general compact connected lie group to the corresponding statement for a maximal torus @xmath410 of @xmath17 , and then prove the theorem just for the case when @xmath17 is a torus .",
    "the first step is achieved by the abelianization theorem :    [ equimartin ] let @xmath11 as above be equipped with commuting hamiltonian group actions of compact connected lie groups @xmath411 , let @xmath56 be a maximal torus of @xmath17 , and let @xmath412 be an element of @xmath413 .",
    "then in @xmath414 , @xmath415    this theorem is a corollary of the jeffrey - kirwan residue theorem  @xcite , but was also proven directly by martin  @xcite .",
    "the original theorem of martin was not formulated in an equivariant setting ( i.e.  no @xmath98 was present ) , but it suffices to remark here that the proof given in  @xcite is valid without modifications in the equivariant case as well .",
    "now , to prove theorem  [ equijk ] for a torus @xmath416 , we will first outline the strategy of the proof given in  @xcite , and then comment on how it can be used for our equivariant purposes .",
    "begin by choosing a cone @xmath66 , as follows .",
    "look at the weights of the torus @xmath1 at all the components of @xmath42 .",
    "each of these determines a hyperplane in @xmath83 .",
    "choose a connected component of the complement of their union ; call this @xmath66 .",
    "then look at a polyhedral cone containing the dual cone , say @xmath417 .",
    "the next step is to take the symplectic cut @xmath418 of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath419  having chosen @xmath419 in such a way that this is smooth . for technical purposes",
    "we here first alter our moment map for the @xmath1-action a little by choosing a point @xmath420 , and replacing @xmath223 by @xmath421 . as we inherit a commuting action of @xmath1 and @xmath98 on this",
    ", we can investigate the fixed - point set @xmath422 .",
    "the fixed - point components come in three flavors : ` old ones , ' i.e. components @xmath28 with @xmath423 , ` new ones , ' i.e. components @xmath424 with @xmath425 , and the component at the vertex of @xmath419 , which we can identify with @xmath426 . applying the localization theorem",
    "to @xmath418 gives @xmath427 as a function on @xmath428 this is ` holomorphic ' ( i.e. the analytic continuation is holomorphic on the complexification @xmath429 ) , and for such functions it is proven by jeffrey and kogan  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.3 ) that the residue with respect to @xmath66 and @xmath430 give the same results .",
    "this leads to the equality @xmath431 \\\\",
    "= { \\text{jkres}}^{-\\lambda } \\left ( \\sum_f \\int_f \\frac{e^{\\tilde{\\omega}}\\ i_f^ * \\eta}{e_{t } ( \\nu_f ) } + \\sum_{\\tilde{f } } \\int_{\\tilde{f } } \\frac{e^{\\tilde{\\omega}}\\ i_{\\tilde{f}}^ * \\eta_{\\sigma}}{e_{t_1 } ( \\nu_g ) } + \\int_{m{/\\ ! \\!/}_{\\epsilon p } t}\\frac{e^{\\tilde{\\omega}}\\ i^ * \\eta}{e_{t_1 } ( \\nu_{m{/\\ ! \\!/}t } ) } \\right)[dx ] .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the modification of the moment map from @xmath103 to @xmath432 is done exactly to ensure that the residue operation is valid for all the terms appearing above .",
    "next it is shown in  @xcite that in fact , for small enough @xmath433 and with the choices of @xmath66 , @xmath419 and @xmath432 as above , @xmath371 terms in this equality are zero , leading to @xmath434= { \\text{jkres}}^{\\lambda } \\sum_f \\int_f \\frac{e^{\\tilde{\\omega}}\\ i_f^ * \\eta}{e_{t } ( \\nu_f)}[dx].\\ ] ] finally , take the limit as @xmath435 . by identifying the weights of @xmath1 on @xmath436 ( which is a bundle of rank @xmath437 ) , one obtains @xmath438= \\int_{m{/\\ !",
    "\\!/}t } e^{\\omega}\\ \\kappa{\\eta},\\ ] ] and finally this gives @xmath439.\\ ] ] this is how theorem  [ lisafrances ] is proved in the non - equivariant case in  @xcite .",
    "now in order to make this valid in the presence of the extra group action of @xmath98 , we remark that because the actions of @xmath1 and @xmath98 on @xmath11 commute , the action of @xmath98 descends to @xmath418 .",
    "now we can use our approximation of the borel model by smooth finite - dimensional spaces @xmath440 , determined by finite - dimensional approximations @xmath441 to the classifying space @xmath442 .",
    "these spaces are not symplectic , but they still are poisson manifolds , with the fibers of @xmath443 as the symplectic leaves .",
    "furthermore , as the moment map @xmath444-action is invariant under @xmath98 , we get moment maps @xmath445 in the sense of poisson geometry ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "also , as the proof of the localization theorem used in ( [ misschien ] ) essentially only uses the functoriality of the integral as a push - forward ( see  @xcite ) , we can apply it to other ( proper ) push - forwards as well .",
    "in particular , consider @xmath446 denote the corresponding push - forward by @xmath447 , so that @xmath448 and @xmath449 the equivalent of the localization formula is then @xmath450 we can now apply the residue operation @xmath64 to both sides ( or rather the obvious extension of the residue from @xmath451 to the various @xmath452 ) , and we observe that for the same reasons as in  @xcite , the equivalences of ( [ eindelijk ] ) and the cancellations of the four terms are still valid  this time interpreted as happening in @xmath453 .",
    "the same is the case for the equivalent statement of ( [ pfst ] ) : essentially the only thing we need to remark for this is that the weights for the action of @xmath1 occurring on the normal bundles of @xmath454 in @xmath418 are the same as the weights for the normal bundle of @xmath455 in @xmath456 .",
    "furthermore , as all the spaces are finite - dimensional , the inverses of the euler classes exist in the usual way .",
    "so we have @xmath457.\\ ] ] now we want to take the limit @xmath458 to obtain the desired @xmath98-equivariant result .",
    "we need to observe in which ring we allow all of the manipulations to take place . begin by remarking that in the proof of the abelian localization theorem  @xcite , which was the basis of all of our localization results , one had to kill some of the torsion in the equivariant cohomology ring , but tensoring with the full fraction field @xmath451 is a bit excessive . in particular , we can do with just inverting all products of linear factors @xmath459 , with @xmath460 . doing this has the advantage that we still have a grading on the ring we obtain ( say @xmath461 ) .",
    "this gives a bigrading on @xmath462 for all @xmath463 .",
    "now complete these rings by means of the filtration @xmath464 where @xmath465 consists of finite sums of elements of bidegree @xmath466 such that @xmath467 .",
    "this completion has all the desired properties ( though it is of course not unique as such ) : it contains the formal cohomology classes @xmath468 , and it allows us to invert the equivariant euler classes  which because of the splitting principle we can write without loss of generality as @xmath469 with @xmath470 , @xmath471  as @xmath472 the residue @xmath64 of an integral of such a class will lie in the usual completion of @xmath414 by degree .",
