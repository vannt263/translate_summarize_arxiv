    "it has been known for some time that the @xmath0 scattering amplitude at high energies will be a very useful tool in the search for new particles and interactions in an @xmath2 linear collider operated in the @xmath3 mode . in particular , as according to present ideas , this scattering can be achieved by colliding @xmath4 beams at a future linear collider , such as the ilc , with laser photons ( which are subsequently backscattered , through the compton effect ) to produce very energetic photons of high luminosity along the @xmath4 direction ; while the @xmath4 beams would loose most of their energy . as such , these searches may involve either the direct production of new degrees of freedom ( for example , charginos , light sleptons or a light stop in susy models ) ; or the precise study of the production of sm particles , where the the new degrees of freedom contribute virtually in some loop diagrams . in this respect ,",
    "processes like @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 should all provide very important tools for searching or constraining new physics @xcite ; particularly as the sm contributions in these processes first appear at the one - loop level and should be small .    as a large number of helicity amplitudes can contribute to these processes , due to the presence of spin - one particles in the initial and final states , considerations of symmetries and other invariances",
    "is required to reduce this number .",
    "furthermore , in the sm the amplitudes of @xmath0 will have contributions from one - loop diagrams mediated by charged fermions ( leptons and quarks ) and @xmath1-bosons . at large energies ( @xmath7 ) it is know that the @xmath1 contributions dominate over the fermionic contributions . at these energies",
    "it should also be noted that the dominant amplitudes are predominantly imaginary .",
    "therefore we expect that any new physics effects in the @xmath0 process may come from the interference terms between the predominantly imaginary sm amplitudes and new physics effects to these amplitudes .",
    "at this point we would like to point out that though the sm has been very successful in explaining all electroweak interactions probed so far , there is no symmetry or relation which protects the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "in fact the higgs mass diverges quadratically when quantum corrections in the sm are taken into account . but precision electroweak data demands the lightest higgs boson mass be @xmath8gev ! in order for this to happen we either need to invoke some symmetries which will protect the higgs mass to a much higher scale ( possibly gut scale ) or assume that the sm is an effective theory valid up to only the electroweak scale . in either of these possibilities",
    "it is expected that some new physics should takeover from the sm at the tev scale . as such",
    ", supersymmetry has provided one popular example of new physics , where additional symmetries are invoked which help protect the higgs mass up to gut scale . recently",
    "a new approach to address this problem has been advocated , the approach popularly known as the _",
    "`` little higgs models '' _ , which addresses some of the problems in the sm by making the higgs boson a pseudo - goldstone boson of a symmetry which is broken at some higher scale @xmath9 .",
    "the suggestion of making the higgs a pseudo - goldstone boson was proposed some time ago @xcite but has been revived recently , where such models have been successfully constructed by arkani - hamed , cohen and georgi @xcite .",
    "the successful little higgs models are constructed in such a way that _ no single _ interaction breaks all the symmetries , but the symmetries are broken _",
    "collectively_. in these models the scale @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is chosen to be @xmath11tev .",
    "the scale @xmath9 acts as a cut - off which separates the weakly interacting low energy range from possible strongly interacting sectors at higher energies .",
    "the higgs fields then acquire a mass radiatively at the electroweak scale .",
    "note that in this model the higgs field remains light , being protected by the approximate global symmetry and free from any one - loop quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff scale @xmath9 .",
    "note also , that in doing this we are required to introduce several new heavy gauge bosons and other new particles , which shall be discussed further in section 2 .",
    "however , it must be noted that the originally proposed implementations of the lh approach suffered from severe constraints from precision electroweak measurements @xcite , which could only be satisfied by finely tuning the model parameters .",
    "the most serious constraint resulted from the tree - level corrections to precision electroweak observables due to the exchanges of the additional heavy gauge bosons present in the theories ( because their masses are much smaller than the cut - off scale ) , as well as from the small but non - vanishing vev of an additional weak - triplet scalar field . as a result ,",
    "masses of new particles had to be raised , and the fine - tuning of the higgs boson mass is re - introduced . motivated by these constraints , several new variants of the lh model were proposed @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the implementation of the @xmath12 symmetry , called t - parity , into the model , as proposed in references @xcite .",
    "t - parity explicitly forbids any tree - level contribution from the new heavy gauge bosons to the observables involving only sm particles as external states .",
    "it also forbids the interactions that induced the triplet vev . as a result , in t - parity symmetric lh models , corrections to precision electroweak observables",
    "are generated exclusively at loop level .",
    "this implies that the constraints are generically weaker than in the tree - level case , and fine tuning can be avoided @xcite .    note that due to t - parity the lightest t - odd particle becomes stable and a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "this is an interesting feature of the model , because the existence of dark matter is now established by recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "since the lightest t - odd particle is electrically and colour neutral , and has a mass of @xmath13gev @xcite in many lh models with t - parity , these models provide a wimp dark matter candidate @xcite , and are able to account for the large scale structure of the present universe .    with this in mind , we review the lh model we have used in section 2 before proceeding to investigate the helicity amplitudes of the scattering process @xmath0 in section 3 .",
    "finally we conclude with the discussion of the results of our numerical analysis in section 4 .",
    "in this section we will briefly describe the lh models which we have used in our analysis .",
    "in particular the minimal version of the lh model , the so - called _ littlest higgs model _ @xcite .    to begin ,",
    "let us recall that it is known that the scalar mass in a generic quantum field theory will receive quadratically divergent radiative corrections , all the way up to the cut - off scale .",
    "the lh model solves this problem by eliminating the lowest order contributions via the presence of a partially broken global symmetry ( where the non - linear transformation of the higgs fields under this global symmetry prohibits the existence of a higgs mass term of the form @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is done by introducing a new set of heavy gauge bosons ( with the same quantum numbers as the sm gauge bosons ) , where the gauge couplings to the higgs bosons are patterned in such a way that the quadratic divergences induced in the sm gauge boson loops are canceled by the quadratic divergence induced by the heavy gauge bosons at one - loop level .",
    "one also introduces a heavy fermionic state which couples to the higgs field in a specific way , so that the one - loop quadratic divergence induced by the top - quark yukawa coupling to the higgs boson is canceled . furthermore , extra higgs fields exist as the goldstone boson multiplets from the global symmetry breaking . on this framework",
    "the _ littlest higgs _ model was introduced , which was based on an @xmath15 coset .",
    "the phenomenology of this model was discussed in great detail in precision tests @xcite and low energy measurements @xcite .",
    "lh models generically also predict the existence of a doubly charged triplet higgs .",
    "the phenomenology of triplet higgs within the context of the lh model has also been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "a detailed review of lh models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the model we shall use in our analysis , the _",
    "littlest higgs model _",
    "@xcite , is a non - linear @xmath16 model based on an @xmath17 global symmetry which contains a gauged @xmath18_1\\bigotimes \\left[su(2 ) \\times u(1 ) \\right]_2 $ ] symmetry with couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 as its subgroup .",
    "furthermore , the global @xmath17 symmetry is broken into @xmath21 by the vacuum expectation value of the sigma field _ 0 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & + 0 & 1 & 0 + & 0 & 0    ) .",
    "[ eq : sec2:1 ] where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 identity matrix .",
    "this breaking simultaneously breaks the gauge group to an @xmath24 subgroup , which is identified with the sm group .",
    "the breaking of the global @xmath25 gives rise to 14 goldstone bosons , @xmath26 which can be written as = e^i /f _ 0 e^i ^t / f = _ 0 + _ 0 + o(1/f^2 ) , [ eq : sec2:2 ] where @xmath27 corresponds to the broken @xmath17 generators .",

    "as stated earlier , the vev ( @xmath41 ) given in eqn([eq : sec2:1 ] ) breaks the gauge group to the diagonal one , which is then identified with the sm group .",
    "this generates mass and mixings of the gauge bosons .",
    "the heavy gauge boson mass eigenstates are given by w_h^a = - c w_1^a + s w_2^a  ,   b_h = - c b_1 + s b_2 , [ eq : sec2:7 ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mixing angles given by c = & g/g_2  ,   s & = g/g_1 , + c = & g / g_2  ,   s & = g / g_1 .",

    "[ eq : sec2:10 ] the orthogonal combination of these gauge bosons are identified with the sm @xmath1 and @xmath45 .    in the sm",
    "the top quark introduces quadratic corrections to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the lh model addresses this problem by the introduction of a new set of heavy fermions which couple to the higgs such that it cancels the quadratic divergences to the higgs mass ; due to the sm top quark . a vector like top quark is usually introduced in the lh model to do this job .",
    "the yukawa interactions in the lh model are chosen to be : _",

    "[ eq : sec2:13 ] in the lh models there is no higgs potential at tree level , this is generated at one - loop level via the interactions with gauge bosons and fermions .",

    "this gives the higgs masses as : m_^2 = 2 m_h^2 , [ eq : sec2:14 ] where @xmath55 is the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "therefore , for this kind of lh model ( based on @xmath15 ) we have five input parameters , in addition to the sm higgs mass , explicitly , these are @xmath56    the advantage of this model now becomes apparent ; by noting that as the gauge generators are embedded in the @xmath17 group , in such a way as to commute with an @xmath57 subgroup , one pair of gauge couplings must be set to zero .",
    "therefore the higgs mass would be an exact goldstone boson and massless .",
    "as such , any diagram renormalizing the higgs mass will vanish unless it involves at least two of the gauge couplings .",
    "note that at the one - loop level all diagrams satisfying this condition are only logarithmically divergent .",
    "therefore the symmetry breaking mechanism protects the higgs mass from quadratic divergences at this level .",
    "generically the particle spectrum of the lh model , apart from sm particles is :    * heavy vector like top quark ( t ) ; * heavy gauge bosons : charged ( @xmath58 ) , neutral ( @xmath59 ) ; * additional triplet higgs : ( @xmath60 ) .    as mentioned in the introduction , the original lh models were severely constrained by precision electroweak experiments @xcite .",
    "the main constraints coming from the @xmath61 parameter and the @xmath62 @xcite vertex contributions . other models which evade these constraints have been proposed , but all of these enlarge the global or gauge symmetries . recently cheng and low @xcite introduced a discrete @xmath12 symmetry , which we now call _ ",
    "t - parity \" _ to resolve the electroweak precision constraints in the lh models .",
    "the advantages of introducing t - parity is two fold .",
    "firstly it helps relaxing the precision constraints and secondly it also provides a dark matter candidate .",
    "the new parity is an exchange of the two gauge groups and the lagrangian in eqn ( [ eq : sec2:5 ] ) is invariant under this exchange provided that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the implication of this is that the gauge boson mass eigenstates will have the form @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the sm gauge bosons are even under t - parity and are designated by a @xmath67 subscript , and the new _  t - odd \"",
    "_ gauge bosons are designated by a @xmath68 subscript .",
    "the different t - parity states do not mix and after electroweak symmetry breaking , the weinberg angle is given by the usual sm relation , as are other electroweak observables ( thus removing the constraint ) .",
    "note further that as the transformation law ensures that the complex @xmath30 triplet is odd under t - parity , whilst the higgs doublet is even , the trilinear coupling @xmath69 is forbidden .",
    "this further relaxes precision electroweak constraints on the model .",
    "thus the main implications of the introduction of t - parity are :    * all new particles ( except one heavy top quark ) are odd under t - parity ; * t - parity exchanges @xmath70_1 $ ] and @xmath71_2 $ ] ; * t - parity imposes a relationship between the couplings , for example @xmath63 , @xmath72 ; * the fermion sector is extended to include t - odd fermions ; * there is no vev to the triplet higgs .",
    "this being assured by the absence of a @xmath73 coupling .",
    "in such a model ( @xmath15 with t - parity ) the input model parameters ( apart from sm higgs mass @xmath55 ) are : @xmath74 the first two have been defined before and @xmath75 is a free parameter whose range is @xmath76 @xcite . as we are interested in the @xmath0 process , where this process occurs at one - loop by the mediation of charged particles , it should be noted that in the sm this process is mediated by charged @xmath1 and fermions ( charged leptons and quarks ) .",
    "this process in the lh model can also be mediated by charged gauge bosons ( @xmath58 ) , charged higgs ( @xmath77 ) and new fermions ( @xmath78 in the lh model without t - parity ; note that in the lh model with t - parity , there shall also be @xmath79 and heavy t - odd fermions which can mediate the process ) . to conclude this section , we have given the mass spectrum of these particles in the lh models in table [ table:1 ] .",

    "whereas this relationship is not present for other values of the scattering angle .    we should note , at this point , that the @xmath0 scattering proceeds through loops , both in the sm and in the lh models . in these loops intermediate particles are pair produced ( which is why lh models with t - parity are particularly interesting as precision and cosmological constraints on lh particle masses is much weaker @xcite ) . in the sm these are dominated by @xmath1 loops , leading to a peak in the sm cross - sections around the threshold of the @xmath1 pair production @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the lh model ( with and without t - parity ) , the dominant contribution will come from the new heavy @xmath1-boson and the higgs particles ( especially those that are doubly charged ) , once we exceed the threshold for the pair production of these particles .",
    "as such , we have plotted the various cross - sections for a range of energies ( @xmath109 ) well above the threshold for the sm @xmath1-bosons , but in the vicinity of the pair production energy for the new particles in the lh models , see figures ( [ fig : lh_intcross_1],[fig : lh_intcross_2 ] ) . note",
