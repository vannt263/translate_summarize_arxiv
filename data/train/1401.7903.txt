    "the noncommutative spaces have been the subject of a great number of studies in recent years @xcite .",
    "the natural appearance of these spaces in some areas of physics , for example in the string theory , is a part of the motivation . in particular , the canonical relation @xmath0=\\mathrm{i } \\,\\theta_{a\\ , b}\\,\\id,\\ ] ] is shown to describe the algebra between the coordinates of the longitudinal directions of @xmath1-branes in presence of a constant @xmath2-field background @xcite .",
    "the natural extension of the above algebra is to take the commutators of the coordinates non - constant .",
    "examples of this kind are , the noncommutative cylinder and the @xmath3-deformed plane @xcite , the @xmath4-poincar algebra @xcite , and linear noncommutativity of the lie algebra type @xcite . in the latter",
    "the dimensionless spatial position operators satisfy : @xmath5= f^c{}_{a\\ , b}\\,\\hat{x}_c,\\ ] ] in which @xmath6 s are the structure constants of a lie algebra , for example the algebra by so(3 ) or su(2 ) groups .",
    "a special case , the so - called fuzzy sphere , is when an irreducible representation of the position operators is taken , by which the casimir of the algebra is constant , hence the name sphere @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is to not restrict the representation to an irreducible one , but all of the irreducible representations would be taken @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "in particular , the regular representation of the group would be considered , and as the consequence , the model is built on the whole space , not on a sub - space , as the case with fuzzy sphere .    in @xcite basic ingredients for calculus on a linear lie type",
    "fuzzy space and the field theoretic aspects on such a space were studied in details .",
    "the most remarkabale features of the field theories on such a space happen to be : 1 ) they are free from any ultraviolet divergences if the group is compact ; 2 ) the momentum conservation is modified , in the sense that the vector addition is replaced by a non - abelian operation @xcite ; 3 ) in the transition amplitudes only the so - called planar graphs contribute .",
    "the classical motion on noncommutative space has attracted interests as well @xcite . in particular , the central force problems on space - times with canonical and linear noncommutativity and their observational consequences have been the subject of different research works @xcite . in @xcite the classical mechanics defined on a space with su(2 ) algebra was studied . in particular , the poisson structure induced by noncommutativity of su(2 ) type was investigated , for either the cartesian or euler parametrization of su(2 ) group . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that on a su(2 ) type space it is only the kepler potential , as a single - term power - law one , for which all of nearly circular orbits are closed .",
    "further , it was proved for the kepler potential all of bounded orbits , no matter how far from circle , is closed @xcite .",
    "the commutation relations of the position and momentum operators on a space with su(2 ) algebra was studied in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical aspects of these models were explored in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to continue the study the quantum mechanics on space with su(2 ) algebra . in particular ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem for radial potentials is considered in a space whose spatial coordinates satisfy the su(2 ) lie algebra .",
    "the interesting feature by the su(2 ) algebra is , the space happens to have a lattice nature , however a rotationally symmetric one .",
    "also , due to the lattice structure , the maximum value of momentum is bound from above .",
    "the bound on momentum would appear as the basis for surprising features for the model .",
    "in particular , on such a space a repulsive potential can develop bound - states , or an attractive region may be forbidden for particles to propagate with higher energies . as definition of the position eigenstates of the form @xmath7 is not possible due to the algebra ( [ 2 ] ) , the momentum space is commutative , and hence all the necessary ingredients for the model can be defined in this space .    the scheme of the rest of this paper is as following . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the basic notions to formulate quantum theory on a space with lie type noncommutativity are presented .",
    "also in this section the construction is specialized for the case of the su(2 ) group . in sec .",
    "3 the exact radial eigen - functions are constructed by means of associated chebyshev functions . in sec .",
    "4 the radial stepwise potentials are considered , and the exact expression for the energy quantization condition as well as the eigen - functions are presented . in sec .  5 the case with a general radial potential is discussed . in particular",
    "it is shown that the discrete energy spectrum can be obtained in desired accuracy by means of given forms of continued fractions .",
    "consider a lie group g. denote the members of a basis for the left - invariant vector fields corresponding to this group by @xmath8 s .",
    "these fields ( which are sections of the tangent bundle tg ) satisfy ( [ 2 ] ) , with the structure constants of the lie algebra corresponding to g. the coordinates @xmath9 are defined such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the group element corresponding to the coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the identity , and @xmath14 is the flux corresponding to the vector field @xmath15 .",
    "the hilbert space to be considered is the space of functions defined on g , which are square integrable with respect to the haar measure of the group .",
    "the action of the functions of the group and the vector fields defined on the group , on the functions of the group are defined through multiplication and lie derivation , respectively .",
    "the commutators of the operator forms of the coordinate functions and the left invariant vector fields are ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath16&=0 , \\\\\\label{5 } [ \\hat{x}_a,\\hat{k}^b]&=\\hat{x}_a{}^b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 s are functions of g. these satisfy @xmath18    next consider the right - invariant vector fields @xmath19 , so that they coincide with their left - invariant analogues at the identity of the group @xcite : @xmath20 these field satisfy the commutation relations",

    "one then arrives at the following commutation relations @xcite @xmath28&=0,\\\\ \\label{21 } [ x_a , p^b]&=\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,x_a{}^b,\\\\ \\label{22 } [ x_a , x_b]&=\\ir\\,\\ell\\,f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,x_c,\\\\ \\label{23 } [ j_a , x_b]&=\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,x_c,\\\\ \\label{24 } [ p^c , j_a]&=\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,p^b,\\\\ \\label{25 } [ j_a , j_b]&=\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,j_c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that in the limit @xmath29 the ordinary commutation relations are retrieved .      for the group su(2 ) , the commutation relations ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 21 ] ) , and ( [ 22 ] ) make in fact the algebra of a rigid rotator , in which the angular momentum and the rotation vector have been replaced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , that is , the roles of position and momenta have been interchanged . as the consequence",
    ", the position operators do not have simultaneous eigenstates and the space has a lattice structure . as the momentum space is commutative with well - defined eigenstates , we switch to this space . as usual",
    "it is convenient to use the euler parametrization of su(2 ) , defined through @xmath32 where @xmath33a are the generators of su(2 ) satisfying the relations @xmath34&=\\epsilon^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,t_c,\\\\\\label{28 } [ t_a , t_b]_+&=-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta_{a\\,b},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which the second is valid for the defining representation of su(2 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the range of the euler parameters so that each point of the group is covered one and only one time is @xcite @xmath35 one also has @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 . in the euler momentum basis the inner - product of wave - functions is defined using the so - called haar measure @xmath38 , given by : @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is a constant , and is fixed once the normalization prescription is fixed .",
    "the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the momentum basis with proper dimension are given in @xcite : @xmath43 @xmath44,\\\\ \\label{36 } j_2\\to&\\;\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\,\\cos\\theta+\\sin\\psi}{\\sin\\theta}\\ , \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}+(-\\cos\\phi+\\cos\\psi)\\ , \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.+\\frac{-\\sin\\phi-\\sin\\psi\\,\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\psi}\\right],\\\\ \\label{37 } j_3\\to&\\;\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\psi}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that the above operators are hermitian with respect to the inner - product defined by the haar measure ( [ 31 ] ) .    introducing the new parameters : @xmath45 one arrives at ( @xmath46 ) @xmath47 resulting in @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and subsequently @xcite : @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using ( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) , it is seen that the angular momentum eigenfunctions ( @xmath50 s ) satisfying @xmath51 are products of an arbitrary function @xmath52 , and @xmath53 s ( the usual spherical harmonics ) with the cosine of the colatitude equal to @xmath54 and the longitude equal to @xmath55 , that is @xmath56    hereafter we consider su(2)-invariant systems , that is they are rotationally invariant and the hamiltonian @xmath57 and @xmath58 s commute . as",
    "@xmath58 s generate rotations of both @xmath30 and @xmath59 , for a su(2)-invariant system @xmath57 is a function of only @xmath60 and @xmath61 , namely : @xmath62 in which @xmath63 and @xmath64 are representing the kinetic and the potential terms , respectively .",
    "an example for @xmath63 is @xcite @xmath65 by the above choice , originated from the characteristics of spin - half irreducible representations of the group , the kinetic term happens to be monotonic with respect to @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) @xcite .",
    "in the commutative limit @xmath29 this kinetic term is reduced to the commutative case @xmath68 .",
    "for such a su(2)-invariant system , @xmath57 , @xmath69 and one of the components of @xmath70 ( say @xmath71 ) can be taken to have common eigen - functions .",
    "now , the aim is to exploit the su(2)-symmetry of such a hamiltonian to write down an eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian so that that equation contains only one variable , out of the the three variables corresponding to the momentum .",
    "it is in fact an easy task by the expressions obtained so far . by the given form of @xmath61 by ( [ 42 ] ) , and the relation ( [ 44 ] ) , one finds @xcite @xmath72 \\,f(v),\\ ] ] by which the radial part of the schrodinger equation in momentum space takes the form @xmath73",
    "as seen in sec .  2 , for the systems with rotational invariance , as in case on ordinary space , the eigenvalue problem is reduced to a one - dimensional one .",
    "however , it is reminded that in the present case the one - dimensional problem , in contrary to ordinary space is not the length of the position vector @xmath74 , but it is the length of momentum vector , @xmath75 , or alternatively @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "so it is natural to define the basis @xmath78 as the eigenvector of operator @xmath79 acting on subspace with orbital angular momentum @xmath80 : @xmath81 for which using the haar measure ( 31 ) and the variables ( [ 38 ] ) , we have @xmath82 in the present section the aim is to find the eigen - functions of the operator @xmath61 , for which in the @xmath83-space we earlier found : @xmath84\\ ] ] fortunately the operator in the bracket for @xmath85 is known , with the _ chebyshev polynomials _ of type  ii as eigen - functions , satisfying : @xmath86 constructing the eigenfunctions for cases with @xmath87 is rather straightforward , just like the method by which the associated legendre polynomials are constructed @xcite . in general , we will find for the _ associated chebyshev functions _ the following @xmath88 in which @xmath89 , and @xmath90 in which the pre - factor is set in the way that the eigen - functions are normalized , satisfying @xmath91 it is reminded that the original @xmath92 is not normalized to one , and in fact @xmath93 . also , as @xmath94 is a polynomial of degree @xmath95 , by construction @xmath96 , for @xmath97 .",
    "as the associated chebyshev functions are rather less available , in the appendix  a explicit expressions for them together with the plots are presented .",
    "readily , by the basis constructed by @xmath98 s , a representation of @xmath99-function in @xmath83-space is given @xmath100 by these all , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath61 happen to be @xmath101 , for @xmath102 , leading to the degeneracy @xmath103 . reminding that the coordinates @xmath8 s satisfy the algebra ( [ 22 ] ) for su(2 ) , this result is the one to be expected .",
    "so every wave - function with orbital angular momentum @xmath80 can be expanded in terms of @xmath98 s , namely @xmath104 by the above expansion , the probability that the particle would be found at the radial site @xmath105 is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "( [ 54 ] ) for @xmath85 , as a second order differential equation , also has another linearly independent solution , usually denoted by @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "this solution is normalizable , but diverging as @xmath108 .",
    "similar the construction for @xmath98 , one can generate the solutions for @xmath87 , denoted by @xmath109 : @xmath110 it is seen that these associated solutions are neither normalizable nor finite within the interval @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "further , as the original @xmath107 s are not in polynomial form , it can be seen that @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "it will be seen later that due to this property these functions can not appear as coefficients in expansion ( [ 58 ] ) in regions containing sites with radial sites @xmath113 .",
    "the behavior of the two solutions and their associates best can be obtained by the trigonometric function representation of them @xcite , namely : @xmath114 with @xmath115 . to express the solutions in the exponential form one can define the linear combinations : @xmath116 this",
    "exponential representations appear useful to express the wave - functions in terms of oppositely oscillating radial waves .",
    "also , the behavior of the above functions at large-@xmath95 beyond their defining interval @xmath117 would come in forms of exponentially decreasing and growing functions of @xmath95 . as we will see in next section",
    ", these functions might appear as the coefficients @xmath118 s in the expansion ( [ 58 ] ) in the regions with constant potential ; for example in tails of the bound - state solutions of the radial stepwise potentials . in fact , by the above form the behaviors of the linear combinations are summarized at large-@xmath95 as : @xmath119 in which @xmath120 .",
    "it is helpful to remind the recurrence relation @xcite @xmath121 with @xmath122 s are either @xmath123 , @xmath124 , or @xmath125 types , and @xmath126 we mention @xmath127 it is easy to check that the above introduced functions not only satisfy the above identity in their defining domain @xmath117 , but also formally on the whole real axes , @xmath128 . as the kinetic term is linear in @xmath83 , the above identity",
    "comes extremely helpful to obtain the recurrence relations between the coefficients of the trial expansions .",
    "as an illustration , let us consider the case of a free particle . by ( [ 45 ] ) , the energy eigen - function in momentum space",
    "takes the form : @xmath129 in which @xmath130 specify the direction of the momentum , and @xmath83 is related to the momentum by @xmath131 . as for a free particle momentum",
    "commutes with the hamiltonian , its energy eigen - function is proportional to @xmath99-function in @xmath83-space . using the representation ( [ 57 ] ) , for a free particle with momentum @xmath132 , with @xmath133 , we have : @xmath134 it would be instructive to check the above result by the use of the expansion ( [ 58 ] ) . by the hamiltonian of free particle , @xmath135 and",
    "the identity ( [ 64 ] ) , the equation @xmath136 would lead to the recurrence relation for the coefficients in the expansion ( [ 58 ] ) : @xmath137 with the boundary condition @xmath138 . defining @xmath139 and a fresh use of the identity ( [ 64 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath140 , as confirmation of the result ( [ 69 ] ) . in an alternative way",
    ", one may choose the linear combination @xmath141 for which by the condition @xmath138 , we find @xmath142 , leading to the previous result . by the condition @xmath143 for detectable particles , we find @xmath144 expressing that the energy of a free particle with its momentum taking values on a compact space would be bounded from above .",
    "by the quantized radial distance as @xmath145 , the radial stepwise potentials may be defined by @xmath146 in which @xmath147 and @xmath148 correspond to the radial barrier and the radial square well potentials , respectively . as mentioned for the free particle , the total energy eigen - function in momentum space",
    "has the form ( [ 68 ] ) , for which the dependence on @xmath83 can be expanded as ( [ 58 ] ) . for the regions  i and ii of the potential , the recurrence relations for the coefficients are found as below : @xmath149 in which @xmath150 accompanied by the boundary condition @xmath138 . by the condition @xmath151 mentioned in the previous section",
    ", the more interesting cases happen when @xmath152 , for which the recurrence relation in region  i has nonzero solution . by the properties of @xmath98 s mentioned before and the boundary condition , for the region",
    "i the acceptable solution comes in the form @xmath153 for the region  ii , based on the behavior of the eigen - function for @xmath154 , either @xmath125 with the argument inside the interval @xmath111 $ ] , or exponentially decreasing @xmath155 type outside the interval by ( [ 63 ] ) , are acceptable solutions .        here",
    "we consider the barrier and square well cases separately .",
    "+   + in this case three domains for @xmath159 are recognized , for each one the corresponding @xmath160 are mentioned : @xmath161 out of three domains mentioned in above we have @xmath162 , which are not acceptable for a particle detectable in either region  i or ii .",
    "for the first two domains in above , @xmath163 takes the values for which in region  ii the particle can make oppositely oscillating waves .",
    "so @xmath164 the continuity condition between two regions at @xmath165 and @xmath166 would give the relations between three pre - factors @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and no condition on energy would be required .",
    "as the consequence , in the domains the energy spectrum is continuous .",
    "we mention that this domain of energy reaches the upper bound for the energy of a free particle obtained in the previous section .    for the third domain for energy , however ,",
    "the particle can not have a propagating nature in the region  ii , and so the wave - function should vanish exponentially as @xmath169 .",
    "so , by @xmath170 in third domain and ( [ 63 ] ) , we have @xmath171 in this case the two continuity equations , namely @xmath172 are sufficient to fix the relation between two pre - factors @xmath167 and @xmath173 , provided that the determinant of the equations would vanish , leading to @xmath174 the last expression is in fact the quantization condition , by which a discrete set of the energies in the third interval is obtained . as for these kinds of solutions",
    "@xmath175 by @xmath169 , these states with discrete energies are bound - ones .",
    "the surprising feature of these bound - states is that they are obtained with an initially supposed repulsive potential of a barrier .",
    "it is in fact the result of the bound on the momentum . in particular , although it is expected that outside the repulsive region  i the momentum would grow , but due to the bound , outside the repulsive region would appear forbidden for particle to propagate .",
    "+   + also in this case three domains for @xmath159 are recognized : @xmath176 for the first interval , the acceptable solutions in region  ii are of the form of ( [ 83 ] ) , but with @xmath177 replaced by @xmath178 .",
    "so the quantization condition comes to the form @xmath179 in this case the energy spectrum is discrete , and the eigen - functions , as expected , are bound - states .    for the second and third energy intervals the acceptable solutions are of the form of ( [ 82 ] ) , and we encounter with asymptotically free states .",
    "the surprising feature in this case is with the third interval , for which , although the energy is higher , but due to the bound on the maximum momentum , it is forbidden for the particle to propagate in the attractive region  i.      here also we consider the barrier and square well cases separately .",
    "+   + in this case two domains for @xmath159 are recognized , for each one the corresponding @xmath160 are mentioned : @xmath180 by the same reasonings of the previous part , in the first interval the energy spectrum is continuous and in the second one is discrete ( by condition ( [ 86 ] ) ) .",
    "also , again due to the bound on momentum , in the second interval region  ii is forbidden for particle to propagate , and so states are surprisingly bound - ones .",
    "also in this case there is a gap in the interval @xmath181 $ ] between the continuous ( lower ) and the discrete ( higher ) parts of the spectrum .",
    "+   + also in this case two domains for @xmath159 are recognized : @xmath182 it is easy to see that in the first interval the energy spectrum is discrete ( by condition ( [ 88 ] ) ) , and in the second one is continuous .",

    "the spectrum of energy for stepwise potentials obtained in the previous subsections can be checked in both discrete and continuous parts by approximate methods ; for example by the basis @xmath184 in the rayleigh - ritz perturbation method @xcite .",

    "<S> the eigenvalue problem for radial potentials is considered in a space whose spatial coordinates satisfy the su(2 ) lie algebra . </S>",
    "<S> as the consequence , the space has a lattice nature and the maximum value of momentum is bounded from above . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows interesting features due to the bound , namely , a repulsive potential can develop bound - states , or an attractive region may be forbidden for particles to propagate with higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> the exact radial eigen - functions in momentum space are given by means of the _ associated chebyshev functions_. for the radial stepwise potentials the exact energy condition and the eigen - functions are presented . for a general radial potential </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the discrete energy spectrum can be obtained in desired accuracy by means of given forms of continued fractions .     </S>",
