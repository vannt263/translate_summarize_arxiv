    "graphene , an atomic layer of graphite that supports massless dirac fermions , displays remarkable and promising electronic properties .",
    "recently there is increasing interest in bilayers and few layers of graphene , where the physics and applications of graphene become richer , with , e.g. , a tunable band gap  @xcite for bilayer graphene .",
    "there are some key signatures of dirac fermions that distinguish graphene from conventional electron systems .",
    "( i ) in a magnetic field , graphene supports , as the lowest landau level ( lll ) , a special set of four zero - energy levels differing in spin and valley , as observed via the half - integer quantum hall effect .",
    "( ii ) graphene is an intrinsically many - body system equipped with the valence band acting as the dirac sea .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the filled valence band are fierce , even leading to ultraviolet divergences ; and one encounters such many - body phenomena as velocity renormalization ,  @xcite screening of charge ,  @xcite and nontrivial coulombic corrections to cyclotron resonance .",
    "@xcite    in multilayer graphene the zero - mode landau levels acquire a new aspect .",
    "bilayer graphene supports eight such levels , with an extra twofold degeneracy  @xcite in landau orbitals @xmath1=0 and 1 .",
    "trilayer graphene has 12 such levels with threefold @xmath2orbital \" degeneracy , and so on .",
    "this orbital degeneracy is a new feature peculiar to the lll in multilayer graphene , and leads to intriguing quantum phenomena  @xcite such as orbital mixing and orbital - pseudospin waves . in real samples",
    "these zero - energy levels evolve , due to general interactions , into a variety of pseudo - zero - mode ( pzm ) levels , or broken - symmetry states within the lll , as discussed theoretically .",
    "@xcite    it has been unnoticed until recently that many - body effects work to lift orbital degeneracy . each zero - mode level , subjected to quantum fluctuations of the valence band , gets shifted differently within the lll , just like the lamb shift  @xcite in the hydrogen atom .",
    "this orbital lamb shift was first noted  @xcite for bilayer graphene and is also realized in an analogous fashion  @xcite in rhombohedral ( @xmath3-stacked ) trilayer graphene , which is a @xmath2chiral \" trilayer generalization of bilayer graphene .",
    "this orbital shift is considerably larger in scale than intrinsic spin or valley breaking , and one has to take it into account in clarifying the fine structure of the lll in multilayers .",
    "graphene trilayers attracted theorists attention  @xcite even before experiments , and it has been verified experimentally  @xcite that the electronic properties of graphene trilayers strongly depend on the stacking order , with @xmath3-stacked trilayers exhibiting a tunable band gap and bernal @xmath4-stacked trilayers , the most common type of trilayers , remaining metallic",
    ". currently trilayers are under active study both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to examine the orbital lamb shift and its consequences in @xmath0-stacked trilayers , with focus on electron - hole and valley asymmetries due to general band parameters .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 trilayers critically differ in zero - mode characteristics from @xmath3 trilayers .",
    "in particular , the way the coulomb interaction acts within the lll substantially differs between the two types of trilayers , leading to distinct basic filling - factor steps in which large level gaps appear in each of them .",
    "in addition , the lll of @xmath0 trilayers , unlike that of @xmath3 trilayers , is greatly afflicted with interaction - enhanced electron - hole and valley asymmetries , which affect the sequence of broken - symmetry states within the lll , observable via the quantum hall effect .    in sec .  ii we examine the one - body spectrum of the pzm levels in @xmath0-trilayer graphene , and in sec .",

    "let us now note that , due to this @xmath199 asymmetry , the level spectra may evolve in a different pattern when one empties the pzm sector rather than filling it .",
    "indeed , such a difference is clearly seen from fig .",
    "4(a ) , which shows the evolution of level spectra when the filled pzm sector is gradually emptied ( i.e. , @xmath397 ) under the same @xmath360 t .",
    "actually , fig .",

    "how the spectra evolve at intermediate filling factors , as we have seen , depends on whether one fills or empties the pzm sector and how one does it , e.g. , under fixed @xmath63 or fixed density @xmath399",
    ".    it will be clear from the model calculations above that the @xmath249 and @xmath251 levels evolve individually without mixing with others while @xmath370 and @xmath369 move in pairs , so do @xmath400 .",
    "actually , with this experience , a close look into the empty / filled spectra in fig .  3",
    "allows one to draw a general idea about how the level spectra evolve under fixed @xmath63 and @xmath188 ( or even for small @xmath38 as well ) .",
    "for example , the presence or absence of level mixing is inferred from fig .",
    "level mixing takes place so as to avoid crossing of paired levels @xmath401 or @xmath252 .",
    "as noted in sec .",
    "ii , the ordering of these paired levels , i.e. , @xmath402 and @xmath403 for @xmath404 , is reversed for the full spectra @xmath405 when the coulomb potential @xmath406 is strong enough .",
    "it is thus this inversion of ( empty ) paired levels that drives level mixing .",
    "accordingly , with @xmath407 , mixing of paired levels is necessarily present for almost all values of @xmath63 in fig .",
    "3(a ) , as indeed seen from figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) . for fig .",
    "3(b ) , i.e. , for a weaker potential with @xmath317 , mixing is present only at low @xmath408 t and is absent at higher @xmath63 , as is the case with fig .",
    "when bias @xmath38 is turned on , mixing of @xmath400 disappears rapidly with increasing @xmath38 , but mixing of @xmath401 tends to persist at low @xmath63 , as verified easily .    in the level spectra of fig .  3",
    ", the @xmath251 level is relatively isolated upward from the paired levels @xmath252 , so is @xmath249 from @xmath409 .",
    "it is therefore the lowest - lying @xmath400 pair that is filled first as @xmath410 ( or emptied last as @xmath411 ) .",
    "this leads to a unique @xmath412 ground state [ consisting of filled @xmath252 levels ] with a relatively large @xmath412 level gap , as is evident from fig .",
    "4 . likewise",
    ", an isolated @xmath249 level leads to a unique @xmath413 state with a relatively large gap .",
    "the ground states at other filling factors , in contrast , vary in composition case by case .",
    "in particular , one notices an equally large @xmath414 gap and a relatively small @xmath415 gap in the spectra of figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(d ) , which show essentially the same low-@xmath63 characteristics of the pzm sector",
    "[ at @xmath416 in fig .",
    "3(a ) or @xmath417 in fig .  3(b ) ] .",
    "interestingly , in those low-@xmath63 cases , the @xmath415 state ( essentially ) consists of filled @xmath418 levels , which is the same in composition as the @xmath415 state one naively expects from the one - body spectra @xmath191 in fig .  1 alone .",
    "we have so far supposed unresolved electron spins .",
    "note that the exchange interaction acts on pairs of the same spin and valley .",
    "accordingly , if , e.g. , in fig .",
    "4(b ) , there were two @xmath400 pairs of spin up and down resolved against possible disorder , each pair would repeat the @xmath410 evolution in the figure over the interval @xmath419 , yielding a @xmath420 gap comparable to the @xmath412 gap . in this way ,",
    "small spin gaps , if resolved , are equally well enhanced by the interaction , and will modify the evolution patterns in fig .  4 accordingly .",
    "the transport properties of graphene trilayers have been studied in a number of experiments ,  @xcite and some nontrivial features of the lll of @xmath0-stacked trilayers have been observed .",
    "evidence for the opening of the @xmath415 gap comes from early observations  @xcite of an insulating @xmath415 state in both @xmath0 and @xmath3 trilayers .",

    "common to these observations , in particular , is @xmath199 asymmetry in the sequence of plateaus , with a prominent @xmath412 plateau .",
    "the @xmath379 and @xmath366 case of fig .",

    ", this case will lead to large gaps at @xmath427 , 0 , 3 and 5 , and relatively small gaps at @xmath428 , -3 and -5 . in our picture ,",
    "appreciable @xmath199 asymmetry is a result of coulombic enhancement of the @xmath199 asymmetry in @xmath429 and a large @xmath412 gap is triggered by the valley asymmetry of @xmath429 such that @xmath430^{k ' }   < { \\rm min}[\\epsilon_{0}^{\\rm h } , \\epsilon_{1_{-}}^{\\rm h } ] ^{k}$ ] , i.e. , the @xmath169 valley is relatively lower in spectrum . in general ,",
    "large level gaps are associated with evolution of orbital modes @xmath401 and @xmath400 of basic filling step @xmath431 per spin and evolution of rather independent modes @xmath249 and @xmath251 of step @xmath432 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of @xmath3 trilayers , where large gaps within the lll are associated with evolution ( actually , mixing ) of orbital modes of basic step  @xcite @xmath433 per spin , leading to visible @xmath434 plateaus .",
    "in a magnetic field graphene trilayers develop , as the lll , a multiplet of twelve nearly - zero - energy levels with a three - fold orbital degeneracy . in this paper",
    "we have examined the quantum characteristics of this pzm multiplet in @xmath0 trilayers , with the coulomb interaction and the orbital lamb shift taken into account .",
    "it turned out that @xmath0 trilayers are distinct in zero - mode characteristics from @xmath3 trilayers examined earlier .",
    "@xcite we have , in particular , seen that both valley and @xmath199 symmetries are markedly broken in the lll of @xmath0 trilayers .",
    "these asymmetries appear in the one - body spectra @xmath435 already to first order in nonleading hopping parameters ( such as @xmath203 , @xmath436 and @xmath28 ) , and are enhanced via the lamb - shift contributions @xmath437 and the coulomb interaction acting within the lll .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath3 trilayers the one - body pzm spectra @xmath435 involve , for zero bias @xmath188 , only a tiny @xmath199 asymmetry of @xmath438 and no valley breaking  @xcite linear in nonleading parameters @xmath439 . the lamb - shift corrections @xmath437 add no further breaking ( to the leading order ) .",
    "accordingly , in @xmath3 trilayers the lll is far less afflicted by @xmath199 and valley asymmetries .",
    "the pzm levels differ in structure between the two types of trilayers . in @xmath0 trilayers",
    "they are composed of the @xmath172 and @xmath173 orbital modes distributed in a distinct way at each valley , as noted in sec .",
    "ii , and in this sense the associated valley asymmetry is intrinsic .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath3 trilayers these levels are characterized by the @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath440 orbital modes residing predominantly on one of the outer layers ,  @xcite with the two valleys related symmetrically [ by layer and site interchange @xmath441 $ ] .",
    "the two types of trilayers substantially differ in the way the coulomb interaction acts within the lll .",
    "they thus differ in the way large level gaps or the associated conductance plateaus appear within the lll , with @xmath0 trilayers having basic filling steps of @xmath442 and @xmath3 trilayers having a step of @xmath433 .",
    "interlayer bias @xmath38 also acts quite differently on the two types of trilayers . for @xmath3 trilayers ,",
    "@xmath38 acts oppositely at the two valleys and enhances valley gaps .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath0 trilayers , it works to further split @xmath443 ( and @xmath444 ) , i.e. , enhance orbital breaking at each valley .",
    "the orbital lamb shift is a many - body vacuum effect but is intimately correlated with the coulomb interaction acting within the multiplet .",
    "this is clear if one notes that the filled pzm sector and the empty one , both subject to quantum fluctuations of the filled valence band , differ by the amount of this coulomb interaction .",
    "it will be clear now why this vacuum effect , though it could easily be overlooked if one naively relies on the coulomb interaction projected to the lll alone , has to be properly taken into account in every attempt to explore the pzm sector in graphene few - layers .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath199 and valley asymmetries inherent to @xmath0 trilayers substantially modify the electron and hole spectra within the lll .",
