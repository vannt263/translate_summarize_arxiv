    "entanglement is the key ingredient of all applications in the field of quantum information . due to the non - local character of the correlations that entanglement induces ,",
    "it is expected that entanglement is especially valuable in the context of many parties . despite a lot of efforts however , it has been proven exceedingly hard to get insight into the structure of multipartite entanglement . still , the motivation of our work is as follows . in the bipartite ( pure )",
    "setting , the entanglement present in a bell - einstein - podolsky - rosen ( bell - epr ) state is essentially unique ; i.e. , we can evaluate any bipartite entangled state by the number of equivalent bell pairs , in either a qubit- or a qudit- system , both in the single - copy and multiple - copies case .",
    "the situation is totally different in the multipartite setting however , where interconvertibility under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is not expected to hold @xcite .",
    "multipartite entanglement exhibits a much richer structure than bipartite entanglement .",
    "the first celebrated example thereof was the 3-qubit ghz state , called after greenberger , horne and zeilinger @xcite .",
    "this state was introduced because it allows to disprove the einstein locality for quantum systems without invoking statistical arguments such as needed in the arguments of bell .",
    "another interesting aspect of multipartite entanglement was discovered by wootters _",
    "they showed that a quantum state has only a limited shareability for quantum correlations : the more bipartite correlations in a state , the less genuine multipartite entanglement that can be present in the system .",
    "this led to the introduction of the so - called 3-qubit w state @xcite , which was shown to be essentially different from the ghz state as they are not interconvertible under locc even probabilistically .    in this paper",
    ", we will generalize these results and present one of the very few exact and complete results about multipartite quantum systems , by classifying multipartite entanglement in the @xmath2 cases . since this include the 4-qubit system distributed over _ 3 parties _",
    ", which is the case in e.g. , entanglement swapping , our results will clarify what kinds of essentially different multipartite entanglement there exist in this situation , and give better understanding for multi - party locc protocols .",
    "more specifically , we will address the stochastic locc ( slocc ) classification of entanglement @xcite , which is a _ coarse - grained _ classification under locc .",
    "let us consider the single copy of a multipartite pure state @xmath3 on the hilbert space @xmath4 ( precisely , in abuse of the notation , we would denote a ray on its complex projective space @xmath5 by @xmath3 ) , @xmath6 where a set of @xmath7 constitutes the standard computational basis and it often will be abbreviated to @xmath8 . in locc , we recognize two states @xmath3 and @xmath9 which are interconvertible deterministically , e.g. , by local unitary operations , as equivalent entangled states . on the other hand in slocc , we identify two states @xmath3 and @xmath9 as equivalent if they are interconvertible probabilistically , i.e. , with a nonvanishing probability , since they are supposed to be able to perform the same tasks in quantum information processing but with different success probabilities .",
    "mathematically , @xmath3 and @xmath9 belong to the same slocc entangled class if and only if they can be converted to each other by _ invertible _ slocc operations , @xmath10 is any local operation having a nonzero determinant on the @xmath11-th party @xcite , i.e. , @xmath12 is an element of the general linear group @xmath13 ( we do not care about the overall normalization and phase so that we can take its determinant 1 , i.e. , @xmath14 . ) .",
    "it can be also said that an invertible slocc operation is a completely positive map followed by the postselection of one successful outcome .",
    "mathematically , the slocc classification is equivalent to the classification of orbits generated by a direct product of special linear groups @xmath15 .",
    "note that in the bipartite @xmath16 case , the slocc classification means the classification just by the schmidt rank ( or equivalently , the rank of a coefficient `` matrix '' @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) ) .",
    "we will also address the question of _ noninvertible _ slocc operations ( at least one of the ranks of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slocc ] ) is not full ) .",
    "the set of invertible and noninvertible slocc operations are also called local filtering operations .",
    "consider the bipartite case as an example : slocc entangled classes are found to be totally ordered in such a way that an entangled class of the larger schmidt rank is more entangled than that of the smaller one , because the schmidt rank is always decreasing under noninvertible local operations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : class ] , we classify multipartite @xmath2 pure states under slocc , so as to show that nine entangled classes are hierarchized in a five - graded partial order .",
    "we discuss the characteristics of multipartite entanglement in our situation in sec .",

    "[ sec : mixed ] .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in this section , we give the complete slocc classification of multipartite entanglement in @xmath2 cases .",
    "moreover , we present a convenient criterion to distinguish inequivalent entangled classes by slocc invariants .      we show that there are nine entangled classes and they constitute five - graded partially ordered structure under noninvertible slocc operations .",
    "[ th : main ] consider pure states in the hilbert space @xmath18 , they are divided into nine entangled classes , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] , under invertible slocc operations .",
    "these nine entangled classes constitute the five - graded partially ordered structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : part ] , where noninvertible slocc operations degrade higher entangled classes into lower entangled ones .    .",
    "there are nine classes divided by `` onion skins '' ( the orbit closures ) .",
    "the pictures for @xmath19 cases are essentially same although the dimensions of slocc orbits are different .",
    "these classes merge into four classes , divided by the skins of the solid line , in the `` bipartite '' ( ab)-c picture .",
    "note that although noninvertible slocc operations generally cause the conversions inside the onion structure , an outer class can not necessarily convert into its neighboring inner class ( cf .",
    "[ fig : part ] ) . ]",
    "( @xmath20 ) case .",
    "every class is labeled by its representative , its set of local ranks , and its name .",
    "noninvertible slocc operations , indicated by dashed arrows , degrade higher entangled classes into lower entangled ones . ]    some remarks are given before its proof .",
    "the theorem gives the complete classification of multipartite pure entangled states in @xmath21 cases .",
    "it naturally contains the classification for the @xmath22 ( 3-qubit ) case @xcite and the @xmath23 case @xcite .",
    "we find that slocc orbits are added outside the onion - like picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] ) and the partially ordered structure ( fig .  [ fig : part ] ) becomes higher , as the third party clare has her larger subsystem .",
    "remarkably , for the @xmath21 cases , the generic class is one `` maximally entangled '' class located on the top of the hierarchy .",
    "this is a clear contrast with the situation of the @xmath22 and @xmath24 cases , where there are two different entangled classes on its top .",
    "it suggests that , even in the multipartite situation , there is a unique entangled class which can serve as resources to create any entangled state , if the clare s subsystem is large enough .",
    "this will be proven in sec .",
    "[ sec : chara ] .",
    "we note that it is sufficient to consider the @xmath25 case in the proof of the theorem , since clare can only have support on a 4-dimensional subspace .",
    "this is an analogy with the bipartite @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) case whose slocc classification is equivalent to that of the @xmath28 case , because the slocc - invariant schmidt local rank takes at most @xmath29 . in any @xmath30 case ,",
    "the partially ordered structure of multipartite entanglement consists of nine finite classes .",
    "our result not only describes the situation that only clare has the abundant resources , but also would be useful in analyzing entanglement of two - qubit mixed states attached with an environment ( the rest of the world ) , which could e.g. be used to analyze the power of an eavesdropper in quantum cryptography .",
    "let us consider the situation where alice and bob are considered as one party ( or , one of alice and bob comes to have two qubits ) and call it the `` bipartite '' ( ab)-c picture .",
    "when two parties have two qubits for each , the onion - like structure of fig .  [ fig : onion ] becomes coarser .",
    "the nine entangled classes merge into four classes , and the structure coincides with that of the bipartite @xmath31 case .",
    "we see that we can perform locc operations more freely in the bipartite situation .",
    "likewise , in the bipartite a-(bc ) or b-(ac ) pictures , the onion - like structure coincides with that of the @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) case so that just two entangled classes , divided by the onion skin of @xmath34 or @xmath35 respectively , remain .    on the other hand",
    ", it can be said that the slocc - invariant onion structure of the @xmath36 case is a coarse - grained one of the 4 qubits ( @xmath37 ) case ( see also ref.@xcite ) , i.e. , the former is embedded into the latter in the same way as the structure of the bipartite @xmath31 case is embedded into that of the @xmath38 case .",
    "so , if two 4-qubit states belong to different classes in the @xmath38 classification , these states must be also different in the 4-qubit classification",
    ". it would be interesting to note that the 4-qubit entangled states are divided into infinitely many classes @xcite , in comparison with finitely many classes of the @xmath36 case . in other words , there are infinitely many orbits in the 4 qubits case between some onion skins , while there exists one orbit in the @xmath38 case .",
    "this suggests that a drastic change occurs in the structure of multipartite entanglement even when a party comes to have two qubits in hands @xcite .",
    "now , we give the proof of the theorem  [ th : main ] in two different , algebraic ( in sec .  [ sec : theorem ] ) and geometric ( in sec .  [",
    "sec : geometry ] ) , ways .",
    "readers who are interested just in applying our results can skip to sec .",
    "[ sec : criterion ] , where a convenient criterion for distinguishing nine classes is given .",
    "_ we first give an algebraic proof , utilizing the matrix analysis ( cf .",
    "any state is parameterized by a three index tensor @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this tensor can be rewritten as a @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 by concatenating the indices @xmath44 .",
    "next we define the matrix @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 let us observe that both @xmath33 matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 belong to @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , because of a consequence of an accident in the lie group theory : @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "@xmath55 ) .",
    "accordingly , we see that a slocc transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : slocc ] ) results in a transformation @xmath56 thus , our problem is equivalent to finding appropriate normal forms for the complex @xmath42 matrix @xmath45 under left multiplication with a complex orthogonal matrix @xmath57 and right multiplication with an arbitrary @xmath42 matrix @xmath58 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath45 has full rank , it is enough to operate @xmath59 chosen to be @xmath60 . as a result ,",
    "the state @xmath61 is ( proportional to ) the identity matrix @xmath62 , or @xmath63 the representative of the highest class in the hierarchy .",
    "suppose however that the rank of @xmath45 is three .",
    "as a first step , @xmath45 can always be multiplied left by a permutation matrix and right by @xmath64 so as to yield an @xmath45 of the form @xmath65 suppose @xmath66 , then it can easily be checked that left multiplication by the complex orthogonal matrix @xmath67 and right multiplication with @xmath68 yield a new @xmath45 of the form @xmath69 exactly the same can be done in the case where @xmath70 , and therefore we only have to consider the case where @xmath71 .",
    "it can however be checked that in the case that when 2 or 3 elements @xmath72 are not equal to zero , a new @xmath45 can be made where all @xmath72 become equal to zero : this can be done by first multiplying @xmath45 with orthogonal matrices of the kind @xmath73 and repeating the procedure outlined above .",
    "there remains the case where exactly one of the elements is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath75 ( this is possible because one can do permutations ( with signs ) by appropriate @xmath76 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "this case is fundamentally different from the one where all @xmath72 are equal to zero as the corresponding matrix @xmath77 has rank @xmath78 as opposed to rank @xmath79 of @xmath45 .",
    "there is no way in which this behavior can be changed by multiplying @xmath45 left and right with appropriate transformations , and we therefore have identified a second class ( which is clearly of measure zero : a generic rank 3 state @xmath45 will also yield a rank 3 @xmath77 ) .",
    "it is now straightforward to construct a representative state of each class . as a representative of the major class in the rank 3 @xmath45 , we choose the state @xmath80 as a representative of the minor class in the rank 3 @xmath45 , we choose the state @xmath81 as it makes clear that the states in this class can be transformed to have 3 terms in some product basis ( as opposed to the states in the major class that can be transformed to have 4 product terms ) .",
    "the case where @xmath45 has rank @xmath78 can be solved in a completely analogous way .",
    "exactly the same reasoning leads to the following four possible normal forms for @xmath45 : @xmath82 note that the last two cases can not be transformed into each other due to the constraint that @xmath83 has determinant @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding representative states are easily obtained by choosing symmetric ones : @xmath85 the first state is the celebrated greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , the second one the w state named in @xcite for the @xmath79-qubit case , and the remaining ones represent biseparable @xmath86 states with only bipartite entanglement between bob and clare , or alice and clare , respectively .    as a last class",
    ", we have to consider the one where @xmath45 has rank equal to @xmath87 .",
    "this leads to the following two possible normal forms for @xmath45 : @xmath88 the corresponding states are given by @xmath89 which are the biseparable @xmath90 state and the completely separable @xmath91 state , respectively .",
    "this ends the complete classification .",
    "it remains to be proven that any state that is higher in the hierarchy of fig .",
    "[ fig : part ] can be transformed to all the other ones that are strictly lower .",
    "the first step downwards is evident from the fact that right multiplication of a rank 4 @xmath45 with a rank deficient @xmath59 can yield whatever @xmath45 of rank @xmath79 . in going from a rank @xmath79 @xmath45 of the major class to a rank @xmath78",

    "@xmath97    the proof not only gives a constructive transformations to representatives of nine entangled classes , but also suggests a very simple way of determining to which class a given state belongs .",
    "one has to calculate the rank @xmath98 of the matrices @xmath45 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) ) , of @xmath99 , and of the reduced density matrix @xmath100 .",
    "one gets the following classification : @xmath101    note that the representative states in the ghz - type classes were chosen to be the ones with _",
    "maximal _ entanglement : following @xcite , the states with maximal entanglement in a slocc class are the ones for which all local density operators are proportional to the maximally mixed state .",
    "this is in accordance with the intuition that the local disorder or entropy is proportional to the entanglement present in the ( pure ) state .",
    "we explore how the whole hilbert space is geometrically divided into different nine classes , drawn in the onion - like picture fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] . this subsection can be seen as an alternative proof of the theorem in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorem ] by a geometric way .",
    "we utilize a duality between the set of separable states and the set of entangled states in order to classify multipartite entangled states under slocc @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath91 of completely separable states is the smallest closed subset , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] .",
    "in many cases ( such as the @xmath102-qubit cases ) of interest to quantum information , its dual set is the largest closed subset which consists of all degenerate entangled states , and is given by the zero hyperdeterminant @xmath103 .",
    "we readily see that , in the bipartite @xmath28 case , the set @xmath91 is the smallest subset of the schmidt rank 1 , while its dual set is the largest subset where the schmidt rank is not full ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) .    however , the entangled states in @xmath105 ( @xmath20 ) have a peculiar structure from a geometric viewpoint .",
    "it is not the case here that the largest subset is dual to the smallest subset @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , the largest subset is dual to ( the closure of ) the set @xmath90 of the biseparable states , i.e.,the second smallest closed subset of dimension 6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] .",
    "the dual set of @xmath91 is the second largest subset of dimension 13 .",
    "the reason will be explained later .",
    "significantly , this suggests that for the @xmath106 ( @xmath20 ) cases , there are no hyperdeterminants in the gelfand _",
    "s sense ; in other word , the onion structure will not change any more for @xmath20 .",
    "this is intuitively because the subsystem of one party is too large , compared with the subsystems of the other parties .",
    "remember that it is again an analogy to the bipartite @xmath26 case ( @xmath27 ) , where there is no determinant but its onion structure remains unchanged from that of the @xmath28 case .    in general ,",
    "the hyperdeterminants can be defined for @xmath107 , if and only if @xmath108 are satisfied @xcite .",
    "of course , in the bipartite cases , this condition suggests that the determinants can be defined just for square ( @xmath109 ) matrices as usual . instead , in the @xmath38 case , the zero locus of the ordinary determinant of degree 4 for the `` flattened '' matrix @xmath61 , @xmath110 gives the equation of the largest closed subset .",
    "note that it is the slocc invariant for the bipartite @xmath31 format as well as the tripartite @xmath38 format .",
    "it means that the largest subset is dual to the set @xmath90 of the biseparable states , i.e. , the set of the separable states in the `` bipartite '' ( ab)-c picture .",
    "we should stress that this duality itself is valid in any @xmath21 case , regardless of the absence of the ( hyper)determinant .",
    "next , let us show that the dual set of @xmath91 is the second largest subset for the @xmath38 case . in order to decide the dual set of @xmath91 , we seek for the state @xmath3 included in the hyperplane ( the orthogonal 1-codimensional subspace ) tangent at a completely separable state @xmath111 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in detail . ) .",
    "mathematically speaking , we should decide the condition for @xmath3 such that a set of equations , @xmath112 has at least a nontrivial solution @xmath113 of every @xmath114 . for simplicity , let us suppose that the point of tangency is the completely separable state @xmath115 ( i.e. , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) , the corresponding state @xmath3 should satisfy @xmath118 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : critical ] ) .",
    "we find that the state @xmath3 should belong to the class of dimension 13 , because any state , @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi_dual ] ) can convert to its representative @xmath120 under invertible slocc operations .    in brief , we find that the 14 dimensional largest subset is the dual set of the biseparable states @xmath90 , and the 13 dimensional second largest subset is the dual set of the completely separable states @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , we notice that the inside of the largest subset , given by zero locus of eq .",
    "( [ eq : det224 ] ) , is equivalent to the structure of the @xmath121 case ( since the local rank for clare should be less than or equal to 3 ) , which has already been clarified in ref .  @xcite .",
    "that is how we obtain the onion - like picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : onion ] . in general , we can take advantage of all kinds of the dual pairs for sets ( typically , one is a large set and the other is a small set ) , in order to distinguish inequivalent entangled classes .",

    "we give a convenient criterion to distinguish nine entangled classes by a complete set of slocc invariants .",
    "let us denote local ranks of the reduced density matrices @xmath122 , and @xmath123 such as @xmath124 by the 3-tuples @xmath125 .",
    "these local ranks are always useful slocc invariants . in the bipartite",
    "setting , the 2-tuples @xmath126 are enough to distinguish entangled classes , for both @xmath127 and @xmath128 are indeed nothing but the schmidt rank . in the multipartite setting , however , we need more slocc invariants in addition to the set of the local ranks .    the proof of the theorem  [ th : main ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorem ] has suggested that a complete set of slocc invariants is the rank of @xmath45 in eq .",
