    "therefore , @xmath146 will develop a branch - cut at @xmath147 , if the parameter @xmath24 does not belong to the discrete subset of @xmath148 which determines the spectrum of @xmath126 in @xmath77 .",
    "but this condition on @xmath24 follows easily from the fact that we have _ two _ representations for @xmath124 in @xmath77 , one constructed via @xmath149 and the other with @xmath150 , @xmath151 the expansion in powers of @xmath123 is analytic at @xmath147 in ( [ psi-2 ] ) and analytic at @xmath137 in ( [ psi-1 ] ) .",

    "if @xmath156 solves @xmath155 for one such @xmath123 , it will solve ( [ g - eq ] ) as well and the eigenfunction @xmath157 for the energy @xmath158 possesses the two alternative series expansions ( [ psi-2],[psi-1 ] ) which converge for @xmath159 in the whole @xmath123-plane and are uniquely determined by @xmath156 .",
    "it follows that all regular energy levels of @xmath126 with positive parity are non - degenerate .",

    "there have been early attempts @xcite to obtain an equation for the eigenvalue @xmath165 without the @xmath20-symmetry underlying the functional equation ( [ time - i - schr ] ) , as ( [ coup - sys ] ) arises after a rotation in spin space directly from ( [ ham1 ] ) .",

    "in @xcite it is claimed that a formally exact solution of the eigenvalue problem may be thus obtained in the following way : define @xmath179 for @xmath180 then ( [ recur ] ) with initial condition ( [ initial ] ) is equivalent to the two - term nonlinear recurrence relation v_n= - , n 2 [ recur2 ] with initial condition @xmath181 , if none of the @xmath182 vanishes . but",
    "( [ recur2 ] ) can also be written as v_n= [ recur3 ] which determines @xmath183 `` from above '' instead by the initial condition @xmath181 together with ( [ recur2 ] ) .",

    "this argument , however , is fallacious , because ( [ cont - frac2 ] ) is only a reformulation of the recurrence relation ( [ recur2 ] ) with initial condition @xmath186 and therefore valid for _ all _ @xmath24 , regardless , whether they lie in the spectrum or not .",

    "in other words , the continued fraction in ( [ cont - frac],[cont - frac2 ] ) has no well - defined value without specifying the limiting behavior of the @xmath183 for @xmath188 .",
    "it will converge both for the dominant solutions with @xmath189 as well as for the sought minimal solution with @xmath190 , the difference being that in the latter case the resulting @xmath184 will not depend strongly on the cut - off procedure , i.e. setting @xmath191 with @xmath192 for some sufficiently large @xmath193 , whereas the choice of @xmath193 and @xmath194 has a strong impact on @xmath184 , if one cuts off the continued fraction with @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "this , of course , follows from the uniqueness of the minimal solution to ( [ recur ] ) .    therefore ( [ cont - frac2 ] ) is equivalent to the numerical algorithm",
    "described above . moreover ,",
    "the cut - off at @xmath196 , necessary to define its r.h.s . , renders it equivalent with a diagonalization of @xmath126 in a finite - dimensional hilbert space , whose dimension depends on @xmath193 .    clearly , this problem with the representation of the spectral condition on @xmath24 in terms of an infinite continued fraction is a consequence of neglecting the @xmath20-symmetry which relates @xmath150 and @xmath149 in a nontrivial way and allows the definition of the function @xmath23 , whose zeroes determine the energy eigenvalues of the rabi hamiltonian .",

    "<S> this is quite surprising , as the rabi model has a smaller number of degrees of freedom than the hydrogen atom . </S>",

    "<S> a second quantum number is necessary to discern the energetically degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing is _ accidental _ in the sense that no new symmetry appearing at the given value of the coupling parameter is responsible for the degeneracy , which will concern typically only two states in the spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> it should be emphasized that these `` quantum numbers '' are a more general concept than the radial and angular quantum numbers known from atomic physics  they need not correspond to physical quantities ( actions ) quantized in integer multiples of @xmath95 and have nothing to do with the bohr - sommerfeld semi - classical quantization rules . </S>",

    "<S> this is a phenomenological virtue of the proposed criterion which could be used in computer experiments to test whether a given numerically solvable system possesses a hidden integrable structure . </S>",
    "<S> although a large number of level crossings as a function of model parameters gives a strong hint to integrability , it is difficult to make the argument quantitative , because the number of intersecting ladders could become infinite already for two continuous degrees of freedom . for systems within the present class of one continuous and one discrete degree of freedom , however , its application is fairly obvious . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed criterion is sufficient but not necessary : in systems with factorized scattering matrices , a unique association of eigenstates with quantum numbers is possible which treats the discrete degrees of freedom differently from the present scheme , via the so - called nested bethe ansatz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but also this labeling leads to intersecting ladders as function of the coupling parameter .    on the other hand , the _ absence _ of any level crossings in the spectral graph is sufficient for non - integrability if the total number of degrees of freedom ( continuous and discrete ) exceeds one : it means that the states can be classified only by energy , the single conserved quantity always present in hamiltonian systems , and no invariant subspaces exists . in the context of the rabi model </S>",

    "<S> physically it corresponds to a spontaneous transition of the two - level system which is not driven by the radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the state space does not separate into two subspaces and indeed the spectral graph exhibits no level crossings at all if @xmath110 is not a multiple of @xmath111 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we have only one quantum number , energy , corresponding to the sole conserved quantity . because the number of degrees of freedom nevertheless exceeds one , this model must be considered non - integrable . </S>",
