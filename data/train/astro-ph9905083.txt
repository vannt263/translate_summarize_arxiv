    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe and provide useful cosmological probes , since several properties of clusters are strongly dependent on the cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the statistics of x - ray clusters can serve as an excellent probe of cosmology . the abundance of clusters and its redshift evolution can be used to determine the cosmological density parameter , @xmath1 , and the rms amplitude of density fluctuations on the fiducial scale @xmath2 mpc , @xmath3 ( e.g. white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; fan , bahcall , & cen 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , temperature and luminosity function of x - ray clusters is also used for a cosmological probe .",
    "taking account of the difference between cluster formation redshift and observed redshift , kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) computed a temperature and luminosity function semi - analytically ; comparing the predicted temperature ( @xmath4 ) and luminosity ( @xmath5 ) function with the observed ones , they conclude that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , one tenacious problem in such investigations is the discrepancy of @xmath8 relation between observations and simple theoretical prediction .",
    "this relation should also be an important probe of the formation history and cosmology .    in a separate paper ( fujita & takahara 1999 ; hereafter paper i ) , we have shown that the clusters of galaxies populate a planar distribution in the global parameter space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the central gas density , and @xmath11 is the core radius of clusters of galaxies .",
    "this fundamental plane can be described as @xmath12 we thus find that clusters of galaxies form a two - parameter family .",
    "the minor and major axes of the distribution are respectively given by @xmath13 @xmath14 the scatters of observational data in the directions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ( paper i ) .",
    "the major axis of this fundamental band ( @xmath16 ) is nearly parallel to the @xmath19 plane , and the minor axis ( @xmath15 ) describes the @xmath8 relation .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss cosmological implications of the relations we found in paper i , paying a particular attention to the two - parameter family nature of x - ray clusters and to the difference between cluster formation redshift and observed redshift . in ",
    "[ sec : evo ] , we use spherical collapse model to predict the formation history of clusters of galaxies , and in  [ sec : dis ] , we predict the observable distribution of x - ray clusters .",
    "in order to explain the observed relations between the density , radius , and temperature of clusters of galaxies , we predict them for a flat and an open universe theoretically with the spherical collapse model ( tomita 1969 ; gunn & gott 1972 ) . for simplicity , we do not treat vacuum dominated model in this paper . for a given initial density contrast ,",
    "the spherical collapse model predicts the time at which a uniform spherical overdense region , which contains mass of @xmath20 , gravitationally collapses .",
    "thus , if we specify cosmological parameters , we can obtain the collapse or formation redshifts of clusters .",
    "moreover , the model predicts the average density of the collapsed region @xmath21 .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that the observed fundamental band are described by the two independent parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in particular , the variation of @xmath21",
    "is basically identified with the scatter of @xmath16 .",
    "since the spherical collapse model treats @xmath21 and @xmath20 as two independent variables , it can be directly compared with the observed fundamental band , as long as we assume that the core radius and the mass of core region are respectively a fixed fraction of the virial radius and that of the virial mass at the collapse redshift , as is adopted in this paper .",
    "although the model may be too simple to discuss cosmological parameters quantitatively , it can plainly distinguish the relations between the density , radius , and temperature in a low - density universe from those in a flat universe , as shown below .",
    "for the spherical model , the virial density of a cluster is @xmath22 times the critical density of a universe at the redshift when the cluster collapsed ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cosmological density parameter , and @xmath26 .",
    "the index 0 refers to the values at @xmath27 .",
    "note that the redshift - dependent hubble constant can be written as @xmath28 .",
    "we fix @xmath29 at 0.5 . in practice",
    ", we use the fitting formula of bryan & norman ( 1998 ) for the virial density : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to relate the collapse time in the spherical model with the density contrast calculated by the linear theory .",
    "we define the critical density contrast @xmath32 that is the value , extrapolated to the present time ( @xmath33 ) using linear theory , of the overdensity which collapses at @xmath34 in the exact spherical model .",
    "it is given by @xmath35                 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( \\omega_0 < 1 ) \\\\         & = & \\frac{3(12\\pi)^{2/3}}{20 }             \\left(\\frac{t_0}{t_{\\rm coll}}\\right)^{2/3 }                 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( \\omega_0 = 1 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( lacey & cole 1993 ) , where @xmath36 is the linear growth factor given by equation ( a13 ) of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) and @xmath37 .",
    "for a power - law initial fluctuation spectrum @xmath38 , the rms amplitude of the linear mass fluctuations in a sphere containing an average mass @xmath39 at a given time is @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the virial mass of clusters which collapse at @xmath41 is related to that at @xmath42 as @xmath43^{-6/(n+3 ) }                    \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath44 is regarded as a variable because actual amplitude of initial fluctuations has a distribution .",
    "we relate @xmath34 to the collapse or formation redshift @xmath23 , which depends on cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is a function of @xmath23 as well as @xmath44 .",
    "this means that for a given mass scale @xmath20 , the amplitude takes a range of value , and thus spheres containing a mass of @xmath20 collapse at a range of redshift . in the following ,",
    "the slope of the spectrum is fixed at @xmath45 , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "it is typical in the scenario of standard cold dark matter for a cluster mass range .    the virial radius and temperature of a cluster",
    "are then calculated by @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath49 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath51 is the gravitational constant .",
    "since equations ( [ eq : density ] ) and ( [ eq : mass ] ) show that @xmath21 and @xmath20 are the functions of @xmath23 for a given @xmath44 , the virial radius @xmath52 and temperature @xmath53 are also the functions of @xmath23 for a given @xmath44 ( equations [ [ eq : rad ] ] and [ [ eq : temp ] ] ) .",
    "thus , by eliminating @xmath23 , the relations among them can be obtained .",
    "since observational values reflect mainly the structures of core region while the theory predicts average values within the virialized region , we must specify the relation between the observed values @xmath54 and theoretically predicted values @xmath55 . since we assume that mass distribution of clusters is similar , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , emphasizing that @xmath52 is the virial radius when the cluster collapsed ( see salvador - sol , solanes , & manrique 1998 ) .",
    "in this case , the typical gas density of clusters has the relation @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the baryon fraction of the cluster .",
    "since it is difficult to predict @xmath59 theoretically , we assume @xmath60 , which is consistent with the observations and corresponds to @xmath61 ( paper i ) . for definiteness",
    ", we choose @xmath62 figure 1 shows the predicted relations between @xmath63 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . since we are interested only in the slope and extent of the relations , we do not specify @xmath44 exactly .",
    "moreover , since @xmath44 has a distribution , we calculate for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the lines in figure 1 correspond to the major axis of the fundamental band or @xmath16 because they are the one - parameter family of @xmath21 .",
    "the width of the distribution of @xmath44 represents the width of the band or @xmath15 .",
    "the observational data of clusters are expected to lie along these lines according to their formation period .",
    "however , when @xmath68 , most of the observed clusters collapsed at @xmath69 because clusters continue growing even at @xmath27 ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "thus , the cluster data are expected to be distributed along the part of the lines close to the point of @xmath70 ( segment ab ) .",
    "in fact , monte carlo simulation done by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) shows that if @xmath71 , most of present clusters ( @xmath72 ) should have formed in the range of @xmath73 ( parallelogram abcd ) .",
    "when @xmath64 , the growing rate of clusters decreases and cluster formation gradually ceases at @xmath74 ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "thus , cluster data are expected to be distributed between the point of @xmath75 and @xmath76 and should have a two - dimensional distribution ( parallelogram abcd ) .",
    "the observational data are also plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the data are the same as those used in paper i. for definiteness , we choose @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the figure shows that the model of @xmath64 is generally consistent with the observations .",
    "the slopes of lines both in the model of @xmath64 and @xmath79 seem to be consistent with the data , although the model of @xmath64 is preferable .",
    "however , the model of @xmath71 is in conflict with the extent of the distribution because this model predicts that the data of clusters should be located only around the point of @xmath75 in figure 1 .",
    "finally , we comment on the case of @xmath80 , which is suggested by the analysis based on the assumption that clusters have just formed when they are observed ( e.g. markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "figure 2 is the same as figure 1b , but for @xmath81 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are inconsistent with the observational results , because the theory predicts rapid evolution of temperatures ; there should be few clusters with high - temperature and small core radius .",
    "the results of this letter suggest @xmath82 , and that the clusters of galaxies existing at @xmath69 include those formed at various redshifts .",
    "we also show that the model of @xmath0 is favorable .",
    "importantly , the location of a cluster in these figures tells us its formation redshift . in order to derive the cosmological parameters more quantitatively",
    ", we should consider merging history of clusters and predict the mass function of clusters for each @xmath83 ."
