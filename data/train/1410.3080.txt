    "the mathematical theory of compressive sensing ( cs ) @xcite asserts that one can acquire signals from measurements whose rate is much lower than the total bandwidth . whereas the cs theory is now well developed , challenges concerning hardware implementations @xcite of cs - based acquisition devices , especially in optics , have only started being addressed .",
    "this paper will introduce a color video cs camera capable of capturing low - frame - rate measurements at acquisition , with high - frame - rate video recovered subsequently via computation ( decompression of the measured data ) .",
    "the coded aperture compressive temporal imaging ( cacti ) @xcite system uses a moving binary mask pattern to modulate a video sequence within the integration time @xmath0 many times prior to integration by the detector .",
    "the number of high - speed frames recovered from a coded - exposure measurement depends on the speed of video modulation . within the cacti framework",
    ", modulating the video @xmath1 times per second corresponds to moving the mask @xmath1 pixels within the integration time @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath2 frames are to be recovered per compressive measurement by a camera collecting data at @xmath3 frames - per - second ( fps ) , the time variation of the code is required to be @xmath4 fps .",
    "the liquid - crystal - on - silicon ( lcos ) modulator used in @xcite can modulate as fast as @xmath5 fps by pre - storing the exposure codes , but , because the coding pattern is continuously changed at each pixel throughout the exposure , it requires considerable energy consumption ( @xmath6 ) . the mechanical modulator in @xcite , by contrast , modulates the exposure through periodic mechanical translation of a single mask ( coded aperture ) , using a pizeoelectronic translator that consumes minimal energy ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the coded aperture compressive temporal imaging ( cacti ) @xcite now has been extended to the color video  @xcite , which can capture  r \" ,  g \" and  b \" channels of the context . by appropriate reconstruction algorithms @xcite",
    ", we can get @xmath1 frames color video from a single gray - scale measurement .",
    "while numerous algorithms have been used for cs inversion , the bayesian cs algorithm @xcite has been shown with significant advantages of providing a full posterior distribution .",
    "this paper develops a new bayesian inversion algorithm to reconstruct videos based on raw measurements acquired by the color - cacti camera . by exploiting the hybrid three dimensional ( 3d ) tree - structure of the wavelet and dct ( discrete cosine transform ) coefficients , we have developed a hidden markov tree ( hmt ) @xcite model in the context of a bayesian framework .",
    "research in @xcite has shown that by employing the hmt structure of an image , the cs measurements can be reduced .",
    "this paper extends this hmt to 3d and a sophisticated 3d tree - structure is developed for video cs , with color - cacti shown as an example .",
    "experimental results with both simulated and real datasets verify the performance of the proposed algorithm .",
    "the basic model and inversion method may be applied to any of the compressive video cameras discussed above .",

    "the coded aperture compressive camera system modulates each temporal segment of duration @xmath14 with the moving mask ( the motion is periodic with the period equal to @xmath14 ) , and collapses ( sums ) the coded video into a single photograph ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with the detector size @xmath20 pixels .",
    "the set of data @xmath21 , which below we represent as @xmath22 , corresponds to the @xmath23th compressive measurement .",

    "we record temporally compressed measurements for rgb colors on a bayer - filter mosaic , where the three colors are arranged in the pattern shown in the right bottom of figure [ fig : dec ] .",
    "the single coded image is partitioned into four components , one for r and b and two for g ( each is @xmath39 the size of the original spatial image ) .",
    "the cs recovery ( video from a single measurement ) is performed separately on these four mosaiced components , prior to demosaicing as shown in figure [ fig : dec](b ) .",
    "one may also jointly perform cs inversion on all 4 components , with the hope of sharing information on the importance of ( here wavelet and dct ) components ; this was also done , and the results were very similar to processing r , b , g1 and g2 separately .",
    "note that this is the key difference between color - cacti and the previous work of cacti in @xcite .",
    "an image s zero - tree structure @xcite has been investigated thoroughly since the advent of wavelets @xcite .",

    "introduced a tree - based representation to characterize the block - dct transform associated with jpeg @xcite . for the video representation ,",
    "we here use the wavelet in space and dct in time .",
    "considering the video sequence has @xmath1 frames with spatial @xmath40 pixels , and let @xmath41 denote the indices of the dct / wavelet coefficients .",
    "assume there are @xmath42 levels ( scales ) of the coefficients ( @xmath43 in figure [ fig:3d_tree ] ) .",
    "the parent - children linkage of the coefficients are as follows : a ) a root - node @xmath44 has 7 children , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the size of scaling ( ll ) coefficients ; b ) an internal node @xmath44 has 8 children @xmath47 ; and c ) a leaf - node has no children .",
    "when the tree structure is used in 3d dct , we consider the block size of the 3d dct is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the parent - children linkage is the same as with the wavelet coefficients @xcite .",
    "the properties of wavelet coefficients that lead to the bayesian model derived in the following section are @xcite : + 1 ) large / small values of wavelet coefficients generally persist across the scales of the wavelet tree ( the two states of the binary part of the model developed in the following section ) .",
    "+ 2 ) persistence becomes stronger at finer scales ( the confidence of the probability of the binary part is proportional to the number of coefficients at that scale ) .",
    "+ 3 ) the magnitude of the wavelet coefficients _ decreases exponentially _ as we move to the finer scales . in this paper",
    ", we use a multiplicative gamma prior @xcite , a typical shrinkage prior , for the non - zero wavelet coefficients at different scale to embed this decay .",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 be orthonormal matrices defining bases such as wavelets or the dct @xcite .",
    "define @xmath53 where @xmath54 symbolizes the 3d wavelet / dct coefficients corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 denotes the kronecker product .",
    "it is worth noting here the @xmath58 is the 3d transform of the projection matrix @xmath59 . unlike the model used in @xcite , where the projection matrix is put directly on the wavelet / dct coefficients , in the coding strategy of color - cacti , we get the projection matrix @xmath60 from the hardware by capturing the response of the mask at different positions . following this ,",
    "we transform @xmath59 row - by - row to the wavelet / dct domain , to obtain @xmath58 .",
    "the measurement noise is modeled as zero mean gaussian with precision matrix ( inverse of the covariance matrix ) @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the identity matrix .",
    "we have : @xmath63 to model the sparsity of the 3d coefficients of wavelet / dct , the _ spike - and - slab _ prior is imposed on @xmath64 as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a vector of non - sparse coefficients and @xmath67 is a binary vector ( zero / one indicators ) denoting the two state of the hmt @xcite , with  zero \" signifying the  low - state \" in the hmt and  one \" symbolizing the  high - state \" .",
    "note when the coefficients lie in the  low - state \" , they are explicitly set to zero , which leads to the sparsity .    to model the linkage of the tree structure across the scales of the wavelet / dct , we use the the binary vector , @xmath68 , which is drawn from a bernoulli distribution .",
    "the parent - children linkage is manifested by the probability of this vector .",

    "the hyperparameters are setting as @xmath84 ; the same used in @xcite .",
    "best results are found when @xmath85 and @xmath86 are wavelets ( here the daubechies-8 @xcite ) and @xmath56 corresponds to a dct .",

    "the @xmath91-norm of dct or wavelet coefficients is adopted in linearized bregman and gap with the same transformation as the proposed model .",
    "gmm and k - svd are patch - based algorithms and we used a separate dataset for training purpose . a batch of training videos were used to pre - train k - svd and gmm , and we selected the best reconstruction results for presentation here .",

    "it can be seen clearly that the proposed tree - structure bayesian cs algorithm demonstrates improved psnr performance for the inversion .",
    "we test our algorithm using real datasets captured by our color - cacti camera , with selected results shown in figures [ fig:3balls]-[fig : hammer ] .",
