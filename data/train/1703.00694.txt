    "the analysis includes a wealth of data combining remote sensing and _ in situ _ instruments to investigate the complete chain of action for the cme eruption and its evolution from sun to earth .",
    "we obtain detailed information on the solar surface signatures of the associated flare , magnetic field characteristics , and dimming regions that are subsequently related to the _ in situ _ plasma and magnetic field properties of the cme .",
    "the flare - cme event is associated with a filament eruption that actually occurred in two - steps , starting in the west of the source ar  11305 and moving towards south - east .",
    "the nlff results can well explain the process and demonstrate the magnetic connection , showing that besides the low - lying magnetic flux rope to the south - west of the sunspot , also higher - reaching fields to its south - east were subject to magnetic reconnection .",
    "this is reflected in the cme propagation direction ( e15 ) when compared to the source region coordinates ( w08 ) , and also in the location of the remote dimming regions .",
    "we derive that the magnetic flux rope of the cme is fed by two components , low - lying twisted magnetic fields ( rooted in core dimming regions ) and sheared overlying magnetic fields ( rooted in flare pixels ) involved in the eruption .",
    "we derive a flare reconnection flux of 2.1@xmath2210@xmath23  mx and a dimming flux of 1.1@xmath2210@xmath23  mx .",
    "from h@xmath2 emission we obtain the magnetic flux injected to the cme flux rope at different stages of eruption .",
    "we derive an equal amount of flare reconnection flux during the first impulsive phase of the flare ( 09:1809:44  ut ) , i.e.before the sxr emission reaches m - level , and during the flare s major impulsive phase ( @xmath6209:44  ut ) . hence , reconnection processes were well ongoing before the filament started to erupt ( 09:37  ut ) followed by the restructuring of the magnetic field . in comparison , the dimming flux , covering remote areas in the outskirts of the ar , shows regions involved in the reconnection process at a later time when the cme has already fully erupted ( cf .",
    "bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cdim_n_fpixels ] ) . over the time range 10:4511:30  ut ,",
    "hence , after the flare has ceased , the dimming flux increased from 1.1@xmath2210@xmath23  mx to 1.4@xmath2210@xmath23  mx .",
    "this indicates that magnetic flux might have been added to the flux rope due to ongoing magnetic restructuring , too weak to produce visible h@xmath2 flare ribbon emission .",
    "therefore , the value of 2.1@xmath2210@xmath23  mx for the total axial flux is most probably a lower limit . when comparing this to the _ in situ _ axial magnetic flux of the mc ( @xmath00.5@xmath2210@xmath23  mx ) we find that it is reduced by at least 75% and that the helicity is reduced by a factor of two",
    "this might refer to an erosion of the mc while propagating in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for calculating the helicity from _ in situ _ data",
    ", we took the best estimate of the mc length @xmath52 , as derived from gcs modeling .    the determination of the magnetic flux _ in situ _ as well as the mc radius @xmath63 and @xmath52 is prone to substantial errors .",
    "this is because the parameters used in its determination are derived from the fitting of an idealized magnetic field model ( lundquist force free cylindrical fit in our case ) to _ in situ _ data , where the selection of the mc boundaries affect the calculations .",
    "furthermore , the _ in situ _ models rely on a single 1d spacecraft crossing through a 3d structure , taking many assumptions into play @xcite .",
    "also the gcs model is a fit of an idealized shaped cme to white - light data . in this respect",
    "we note that the mc radius , an important parameter to calculate the flux and helicity respectively , as determined from the _ in situ _ model fit matches well with the radius as derived from the gcs extrapolated to 1  au . for other case studies on this issue including poloidal flux components we refer to @xcite .",
    "the temporal profile of core dimming areas gives indication that the observed cme mass increase of 10% in total , is supplied by the fast outflow from the core dimming regions .",
    "the cme mass consists of coronal plasma which gets compressed and moved away from the sun due to the explosive release of magnetic energy .",
    "the associated dimming regions map the evacuation of the plasma , with the core dimming marking the cme footpoints and the remote dimming the cme body . in a qualitative approach",
    "we attempt to relate the temporal evolution of the core dimming and the cme mass increase . the plasma evacuated from the core dimming area",
    "would be detected in cor2 white - light only beyond the occulter radius of 2.5  r@xmath1 .",
    "assuming an outflow speed of the order of 100200  kms@xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the plasma flow could be a detectable part of the cme mass after @xmath01.53  h ( assuming a detection height beyond 4  r@xmath1 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* this would yield 35.75  h ) .",
    "euv observations reveal that the major changes in the core dimming ends around 11:30  ut , accordingly , outflows would feed mass into the cme until that time . taking the propagation time as described above into account , this mass would become visible in the coronagraph white - light data latest around @xmath017:15  ut .",
    "the cme apex is at a distance of about 1718  r@xmath1 at that time .",
    "this is consistent with statistical results showing that the increase in cme mass is primarily supplied to the rear - part of the cme to distances below 20  r@xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this is supported by @xcite who observed at a distance of 4.1  r@xmath1 continuous outflows in uvcs data over hours after the cme shock propagated through .",
    "they concluded that the transit of the cme flank left the coronal magnetic field open over @xmath06  hours , facilitating fast plasma outflow before the corona recovered to the pre - cme configuration slowing down the outflowing plasma .",
    "we calculate the cme density , using the gcs volume derived for the cme apex to be at 1  au , and the observed 3d - mass at 20  r@xmath1 , which is assumed to be conserved .",
    "the derived density ( 2535  @xmath64 ) is comparable within a factor of two to the _ in situ _ measurements ( 1015  @xmath64 ) .",
    "however , the unknown plasma distribution in a cme volume still leaves many questions open , such as compression during the eruption and subsequent expansion as well as mass supply from fast outflows like core dimming regions .",
    "we note that the cme mass increase might continue during propagation in interplanetary space due to material swept up from the solar wind (  snowplow effect  ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the literature one finds quite high factors of the order of 23 for the cme mass increase in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this might have effects on the drag that the cme experiences during its propagation phase . according to the dbm results from the event under study , the drag was of `` normal '' type and from the density estimate and comparison to the _ in situ _ plasma density data",
    ", we could not confirm a substantial mass increase .",
    "combining model data at various distance ranges gives us new insight into the cme characteristics as it propagates from sun to earth .",
    "however , the uncertainties especially in the derived magnetic field parameters and the lack of _ in situ _ data at close distances to the sun still leaves many questions open .",
    "new missions such as _ solar orbiter _ or _ solar probe plus _ will deliver most eligible data sets to further pursue such studies .",
