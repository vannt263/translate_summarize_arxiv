    "recently , there has been an intense activity on the noncommutative field theories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "noncommutative geometry @xcite is indeed one of the most attractive candidates for new physics beyond the standard model . within the framework of noncommutative geometry , it is possible to deform usual `` commutative spaces '' in `` noncommutative spaces '' .",
    "they are in fact related to noncommutative associative algebras , interpreted as algebras of functions on these `` noncommutative spaces '' .",
    "the moyal space , as a deformation of @xmath0 , is one of the simplest , but field theories can be constructed on other `` noncommutative spaces '' ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , field theories defined on moyal space @xcite can be seen as a limiting regime of string theory @xcite and matrix theory @xcite .",
    "noncommutative geometry can also be used to describe physics in the presence of a background field thanks to non - local interactions , like the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the simplest generalisation of scalar @xmath1 field theory to moyal space was known to suffer from a new type of divergence , the uv / ir mixing @xcite , which is responsible for the non - renormalisability of this model . to cure this problem ,",
    "grosse and wulkenhaar proposed a few years ago to add some harmonic potential in the action @xcite .",
    "the renormalisability of this new theory has been proven at any order of perturbation in the matrix base @xcite , by multi - scale analysis @xcite , in the @xmath2-space @xcite and using dimensional regularisation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this noncommutative field theory seems to have a better flow behavior than the commutative @xmath1 model .",
    "indeed , contrary to the commutative model , the grosse - wulkenhaar theory does not present a landau ghost @xcite ; and a constructive version is possible @xcite .",
    "then , other renormalisable noncommutative field theories have been obtained , for example the lsz theory @xcite , which is a scalar theory covariant under the langmann - szabo duality @xcite like the grosse - wulkenhaar model , or the scalar @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative version of the fermionic gross - neveu model is also renormalisable @xcite , even if it still suffers from the uv / ir mixing .",
    "as in the case of noncommutative scalar field theory , the naive generalisation of yang - mills theory to moyal space , whose action is @xmath4 , exhibits the uv / ir mixing divergence @xcite , making its renormalisability quite problematic . to ensure the renormalisability of yang - mills theory , one has to find what could be the analog of the harmonic term for a gauge theory .",
    "one possible way is to compute the yang - mills effective action from a noncommutative scalar field theory with harmonic term coupled with an external gauge field @xcite .",
    "the present paper is describing such a way .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next subsection",
    ", we present the moyal space , the noncommutative scalar field theory with harmonic term , and the gauge theory in the framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "then , in section 2 , the minimal coupling between the scalar field theory and an external gauge potential is given .",
    "we recall the definition of the effective action and the computation @xcite .",
    "the connexions between this calculation and the parametric representation @xcite is further presented in subsection 2.3 . in subsection 2.4",
    ", we explain the special regularisation scheme used in the computation .",
    "finally , the effective action gives rise to a gauge theory , which is a possible candidate for renormalisability .",
    "this is discussed in section 3 .",
    "we recall here the definition of the moyal space , the noncommutative scalar @xmath5 field theory with harmonic term , and the gauge theory over the moyal space @xcite",
    ". we do not give many mathematical details @xcite .",

    "this theory is renormalisable for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "the constraint @xmath26 is needed for the renormalisability proof only in the case of non - orientable interactions ( @xmath27 ) of complex - valued fields @xcite .",
    "we give here the expression of the propagator @xmath28 @xcite and of the interaction vertex    @xmath29    where we have defined @xmath30 .    in the yang - mills theory ,",
    "fields are gauge potentials , associated to connections .",
    "we can therefore define the notion of ( noncommutative ) connection @xcite on the moyal space : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real field in @xmath18 , the gauge potential associated to the connection @xmath33 .",
    "then , the group of gauge transformations acts on the different fields as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the gauge function and it satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "an important feature of the moyal space is that it involves an invariant connection .",
    "it turns out that @xmath37 defines a connection which is invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "the occurrence of such invariant connections is not new in noncommutative geometry and has been already mentionned in earlier studies focused in particular on matrix - valued field theories @xcite . indeed , because of the equation , which can be reexpressed in @xmath38_\\star$ ] , we can compute that @xmath39 from this special connection , we construct the `` covariant coordinates '' @xcite : @xmath40 this field @xmath41 is not a gauge potential but a covariant field : @xmath42 furthermore , it is possible to express the curvature @xmath43_\\star$ ] , which is also covariant , @xmath44 , in terms of @xmath41 : @xmath45_\\star.\\label{eq : fcovcoord}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the whole formalism needed in this article is presented in subsection 1.2 .",
    "we can now start to define and later to compute the effective action for the yang - mills theory .",
    "we couple in a first time the above action with the gauge potential @xmath32 in order to get a gauge - invariant action .",
    "notice that this coupled action does not contain any kinetic term in @xmath32 , just couplings with the scalar field @xmath22",
    ". then we can integrate over the quantized fields @xmath22 , considering @xmath32 as an external field .",
    "we compute this integration at the one - loop order and get what is called the effective action in @xmath32 .",
    "this effective action contains now some kinetic terms in @xmath32 , but no more term involving @xmath22 .",
    "this effective action is in fact a candidate for a yang - mills theory , and this candidate is interesting because if we couple this yang - mills theory to a scalar field whose action is , this coupled action will be stable at the quantum level .",
    "this property of stability is important for the proof of the renormalisability of a field theory .",
    "let us now define a `` minimal coupling '' between the scalar field @xmath22 and the gauge potential @xmath32 . with the following prescriptions    @xmath46",
    "we replace in the scalar action the gauge non - invariant terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 by gauge covariant terms , and we get the coupled action @xmath49 which is gauge invariant . using equations , we can simplify this action : @xmath50    from the coupled action , we define the effective action @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 notice that the interaction part @xmath53 of @xmath54 does not occur in the computation of the effective action at the one - loop order .",
    "nevertheless , there are some additional vertices involving @xmath32 and/or @xmath55 ( or equivalently @xmath56 ) and generated by the minimal coupling , which can be obtained by combining with the generic relation @xmath57 these vertices are depicted on the figure [ fig : vertices ] . note that additional overall factors must be taken into account .",
    "these are indicated on the figure [ fig : vertices ] .",
    "we now compute all the contributions of the effective action @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding diagrams of these contributions are depicted on the figures [ fig:1-point]-[fig:4-point ] .",
    "the expression for the vertices permits one to obtain the amplitude corresponding to the tadpole on the figure [ fig:1-point ] @xmath58 using the expression of the propagator , becomes @xmath59 to simplify the calculations , we can introduce the following 8-dimensional vectors @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 then , using these new variables , equation can be conveniently reexpressed in a form such that some gaussian integrals can be easily performed .",

    "the combination of with yields @xmath65 evaluating the gaussian integral over @xmath60 , we find @xmath66 this latter expression has a quadratic and a logarithmic uv divergence for @xmath67 .",
    "to obtain explicitly these divergences , we make a taylor expansion of @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a cut - off and the ellipses denote finite contributions .",
    "we can see that the tadpole is non - vanishing .",
    "this is a rather unusual feature for a yang - mills theory , which will be discussed in section 3 .    to compute the 2 , 3 and 4-point functions",
    ", we can apply the same procedure to the one used for the tadpole : matrix and vector change of variables , gaussian integration and taylor expansion for the variables @xmath70 of the different propagators which occur in these amplitudes .",

    "the article @xcite dealing with the parametric representation tells us that by performing gaussian integrations , we get a gaussian function of the external variables , divided by a determinant .",
    "if we note @xmath107 , using @xmath108 , then the expression of the amplitude is given by @xmath109 and that stands for a definition of the polynome @xmath110 in the @xmath111 variables and the quadratic form @xmath112 in the external variables @xmath103 , which is also polynomial in the @xmath111 variables . let us now recall the computation of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    ". it would be possible to compute all the contributions to the effective action @xmath51 we found in subsection 2.2 .",
    "we will nevertheless reduce our study to the contribution @xmath146 .",
    "one can notice on the figures [ fig:4-point ] and [ fig : vertices ] that this contribution involves only the `` bubble graph '' ( see figure [ fig : bubble ] ) .        in @xcite , it was found the expression for the polynom @xmath110 and the real part of @xmath112 of the `` bubble graph '' .",

    "this was just an example to show the calculation power of the parametric representation in our yang - mills effective action s computation .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall explain and justify the special regularisation scheme used in the calculations ( see @xmath72 in subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "in @xcite , the one - loop effective action can be expressed in terms of heat kernels @xmath162=\\frac 12 \\ln(\\det(h(\\phi , a)h(0,0)^{-1})),\\label{eq : defact2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the effective potential . in the schwinger representation ,",

    "so , we get @xmath168 where the ellipses denote finite contributions . the second part of the effective action is called the wodzicki residue @xcite and corresponds to the logarithmically divergent part of @xmath51 .",
    "this residue is a trace and is gauge invariant .",
    "but the first part of @xmath51 , which corresponds to the quadratically divergent part , is not gauge invariant .",
    "that is why the naive @xmath169-regularisation of the schwinger integrals breaks the gauge invariance of the theory in the quadratically divergent part .",
    "one possible way to solve this problem could be the restoration of gauge invariance by using methods from algebraic renormalisation @xcite .",
    "notice also that a dimensional regularisation scheme could have been used @xcite , where the divergent contributions of the effective action were automatically gauge invariant . a hopf algebra description of this type of renormalisation , the tanasa - vignes algebra , has been given in @xcite for the noncommutative scalar field theories .",
    "we give here another way , which works for this special type of theory and which has been used for the calculations ( see subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "to find a convenient regularisation scheme , one can do the following transformation on the cut - off @xmath170 , where @xmath171 , and it can be different for each contribution . the logarithmically divergent part of the effective action is insensitive to a finite scaling of the cut - off , so these transformations will affect only the quadratically divergent part , which is not gauge invariant .",
    "let us consider the contribution of a graph @xmath172 with @xmath173 internal lines and suppose that it involves a quadratic divergence . if not , this contribution does not need any change for the restoration of the gauge invariance of the effective action .",
    "using the polynom @xmath174 @xcite and integrating on the appropriated variables like in , one obtains at the one - loop order that the quadratically divergent part is proportional ( after taylor expansion on @xmath175 ) to @xmath176 .",
    "indeed the integration on the @xmath177 between 1 and @xmath178 gives only finite contributions .",
    "the expression of the propagator implies that a part of the logarithmic divergence is proportional to @xmath179 with exactly the same factor as the quadratic divergence . as @xmath180 the contribution of @xmath172 writes @xmath181 , where the ellipses denote other logarithmic contributions and finite terms , and",
    "@xmath182 is a factor depending on the graph @xmath172 .",
    "the logarithmically divergent term involving @xmath183 in the effective action is gauge invariant .",
    "that is why one has to choose a regularisation scheme @xmath184 so that @xmath185 , i.e. @xmath186 .    therefore , with the regularisation scheme @xmath187 for a graph with @xmath173 internal lines , one can conclude that the gauge invariance is restored in the effective action .",
    "indeed , we made the transformation @xmath188 for the @xmath72 contribution ( see ) .",
    "finally , notice that this method is very specific to this theory and to the one - loop order .",
    "as noted above , the algebraic renormalisation or the dimensional regularisation provide more general results .",
    "let us now summarise the above results . we coupled a scalar theory with gauge potentials to obtain a gauge invariant action in subsection 2.1 .",
    "we then integrated this action over scalar fields and got the one - loop effective action of yang - mills theory .",
    "we showed the procedure to compute this effective action in subsection 2.2 and noticed the links with the schwinger parametric representation in subsection 2.3 . within this parametric representation ,",
    "the calculations are indeed easier .",
    "we discussed also the special scheme of regularisation used in the computations , and explained the reasons why we chose it in subsection 2.4 .    at this point , we obtain from a gauge invariant action @xcite @xmath189 in term of the gauge potential @xmath32 , which is stable at the quantum level if we couple this yang - mills theory to some scalar theory with harmonic term .",
    "the scalar theory of grosse - wulkenhaar is renormalisable to all orders of perturbation , because the harmonic term solves the problem of uv / ir mixing of this scalar theory @xcite .",
    "as the pure yang - mills theory , given by @xmath190 , suffers from the same problem of uv / ir mixing @xcite , it is tempting to conjecture that is a good candidate for renormalisability .",
    "notice that another group arrived at similar conclusions by a different method @xcite , and that the action can be derived from a spectral action principle @xcite .",
    "indeed , taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the action of @xcite can be reexpressed in the form of .",
    "let us go to the details of this action . beyond the usual @xmath4 yang - mills contribution",
    ", we find additional gauge invariant terms of quadratic and quartic order in @xmath41 ( which can be reexpressed in term of @xmath32 through ) @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the quadratic term involves a mass term for the field @xmath32 , while such a bare mass term is forbidden by gauge invariance in yang - mills theories on commutative spaces . in this noncommutative theory , it is therefore possible to have some massive gauge fields without breaking the gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "the quartic term @xmath194 may be viewed as the gauge counterpart of the harmonic term @xmath195 , solving the problem of uv / ir mixing and ensuring the renormalisability of the @xmath196 theory investigated in @xcite .",
    "but before the study of this quantum field theory and its renormalisability , there is already an unusual feature at the level of the classical field theory .",
    "we noticed in the subsection 2.2 that the tadpole was not vanishing . this is the sign of a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value for the field @xmath32 , which is the direct consequence of the presence of the quadratic and quartic term in @xmath41 in .",
    "let us have a look on the equation of the motion @xmath197_\\star]_\\star + \\frac{\\omega'^2}{g^2}\\{\\mathcal{a}_\\nu,\\{\\mathcal{a}_\\nu,\\mathcal{a}_\\mu\\}_\\star\\}_\\star + 2\\kappa\\mathcal{a}_\\mu=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that this equation can be reexpressed in term of @xmath198 .",
    "we see indeed that @xmath199 ( which is equivalent to @xmath200 ) is not a solution of the equation for the real parameters @xmath201 or @xmath202 . nonetheless , @xmath203 ( which is equivalent to @xmath204 ) is solution of the equation of the motion for all @xmath205 and @xmath206 . by expanding the action around this solution @xmath204 through ,",
    "we find the following action ( up to an inessential constant term ) @xmath207 where @xmath41 is then the quantum gauge field with vanishing expectation value .",
    "note that for @xmath208 , the propagator @xmath209 , which is trivial , is non - negative , so @xmath204 is a minimum of the action .",
    "but then , as the action involves only this trivial quadratic term and two quartic vertices , it gives rise to a non - dynamical matrix theory , where the fields are the four infinite - dimensional matrices associated to the @xmath41 .",
    "however the equation of motion has to be further studied , because it can probably produce more interesting vacua , as the one found in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum problem in noncommutative field theory is indeed an interesting question .",
    "notice that it has been studied for the scalar theory with harmonic term in @xcite .    in the line of the non - vanishing vacuum question ,",
    "some others problems remain to be understood and properly controlled as the gauge fixing and the ghost sector @xcite .",
    "after that , subsection 2.4 gives some lights about the choice of a convenient regularisation scheme for the study of renormalisability .",
