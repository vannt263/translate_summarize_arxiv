    "over the last decade several diagnostic diagrams have been proposed to quantify the contribution of star formation and agn activity to the infrared luminosity of infrared galaxies based on mid - infrared ( to far - infrared ) continuum slope , pah line - to - continuum ratio , pah to far - infrared luminosity ratio and the ratio of a high to a low ionization forbidden line such as [ nev]/[neii ] @xcite . however",
    ", none of these diagrams takes into account the effects of strong obscuration of the nuclear power source .    with the advent of the infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite astronomers have been handed a powerful tool to study the 537@xmath0 m range for a wide range of galaxy types at an unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "this enables for the first time a systematic study of a large number of galaxies over the wavelength range in which amorphous silicate grains have strong opacity peaks due to the si ",
    "o stretching and the o  si  o bending modes centered at 9.7 and 18@xmath0 m , respectively .    here",
    "we will introduce the strength of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature as a tool to distinguish between different dust geometries in the central regions of ( ultra-)(luminous ) infrared galaxies as part of a new diagnostic diagram and mid - infrared galaxy classification scheme .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on both _",
    "spitzer irs _ and _ iso - sws _ observations .",
    "the core sample is formed by the irs gto ulirg sample ( pid 105 ; j.r.houck pi ) , which comprises @xmath1100 ulirgs in the redshift range 0.02 @xmath2 0.93 .",
    "this sample is compared to samples of agn and starburst templates from the irs gto programs 14 @xcite and 96 and to selected agns from the gto programs 82 and 86 @xcite .",
    "additional irgs , lirgs and ulirgs were taken from program 159 ( ngc1377 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from the spitzer ddt program 1096 .",
    "iso - sws _ spectra of starburst nuclei were taken from @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _ observations were made with the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules of the _ irs_. the spectra were extracted from droop level images provided by the spitzer science center ( 34 using pipeline version s11.0.2 , 131 using pipeline version s14.0 ) and background - subtracted by differencing the first and second order apertures . the spectra were calibrated using the _ irs _ standard stars hd173511 ( 5.219.5@xmath0 m ) and @xmath3dra ( 19.538.5@xmath0 m ) . after flux calibration the orders were stitched to ll order 1 , requiring order - to - order scaling adjustments of typically less than 10% .",
    "for all the spectra in our sample we have measured the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah emission feature as well as the strength of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature and plotted the two quantities in a diagnostic diagram ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the flux in the 6.2@xmath0 m pah emission band is measured by integrating the flux above a spline interpolated local continuum from 5.956.55@xmath0 m . the equivalent width ( ew ) of the pah feature",
    "is then obtained by dividing the integrated pah flux by the interpolated continuum flux density below the peak ( @xmath1 6.22@xmath0 m ) of the pah feature .",
    "the apparent strength of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature is inferred by adopting a local mid - infrared continuum and evaluating the ratio of observed flux density ( f@xmath4 ) to continuum flux density ( f@xmath5 ) at 9.7@xmath0 m and defining @xmath6 for sources with a silicate absorption feature @xmath7 can be interpreted as the negative of the apparent silicate optical depth .",
    "given the great diversity among our mid - infrared galaxy spectra , there is no `` one - size - fits - all '' procedure to define the local continuum in all spectra .",
    "we therefore developed separate methods for three distinctly different types of mid - infrared galaxy spectra : continuum - dominated spectra , pah - dominated spectra and absorption - dominated spectra .",
    "these methods are illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] and described in its caption .",
    "we are forcing the local continuum to touch down at 14.014.5@xmath0 m , because the ism dust cross - section decreases between the two silicate peaks in this region .",
    "detailed radiative transfer calculations verify that our interpolation procedure properly reproduces the emission that would be generated by dust stripped of its silicate features ( sirocky et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the galaxy spectra in fig.[fig1 ] are classified into 9 different classes based on their 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew and 9.7@xmath0 m silicate strength .",
    "the parameter space covered by the various classes is indicated by shaded rectangles in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "average mid - infrared spectra for the eight populated classes are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the average spectra were constructed by normalizing all spectra to unity at 14.5@xmath0 m flux before the averaging process . in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the average spectra , low s",
    "/ n spectra were discarded from the process .",
    "below we describe the 8 average spectra in the order ( bottom to top ) they are presented in fig.[fig3 ] . the ninth class , 3c , is not populated .",
    "the class 1a spectrum is characterized by a nearly featureless hot dust continuum with a very weak silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath0 m .",
    "the class 1b spectrum differs from the class 1a spectrum by clearly showing the family of pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , 12.7 and 17.3@xmath0 m on top of a hot dust continuum .",
    "this hot dust continuum is nearly absent in the class 1c spectrum , allowing the pah emission features to dominate the mid - infrared spectral appearance .",
    "silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath0 m becomes noticable in the class 2c spectrum as an increased depth of the depression between the 69 and 1113@xmath0 m pah emission complexes .",
    "another marked difference with the class 1c spectrum is the steepening of the 2030@xmath0 m continuum and the appearance of an 18@xmath0 m silicate absorption feature . in the class 2b spectrum",
    "the pah features appear weaker than in the class 2c spectrum .",
    "in addition , the spectrum starts to show a 6@xmath0 m water ice and a 6.85@xmath0 m aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption band . in the class 3b spectrum",
    "these absorption features reach their maximum depths , while the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 m silicate features continue to increase in depth up to class 3a .",
    "absorption features of _ crystalline _ silicates @xcite appear in the spectra of the classes 3b and 3a at 16 , 19 and 23@xmath0 m .",
    "equivalent widths of pah emission features and emission lines decrease from class 2b to 3b and 3a .",
    "note especially the change in shape of the 7.7@xmath0 m pah feature as it first broadens and then disappears going from class 2b to 3b and 3a .",
    "finally , the class 2a spectrum differs from the class 3a spectrum mainly by a clearly lower apparent depth of the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 m silicate features .",
    "note that the spectral structure in individual spectra may differ substantially from the average properties of the classes . in fig.[fig3 ] this is represented by the 1-@xmath8 dispersion ranges around the individual average spectra .",
    "the galaxies shown in fig.[fig1 ] are color - coded according to their galaxy classification .",
    "however , their positions may differ from their original assignments , as in fig.[fig1 ] the 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew has been corrected for the effect of 6@xmath0 m water ice absorption on the 6.2@xmath0 m continuum through substitution of the observed 6.2@xmath0 m continuum by the 6.2@xmath0 m continuum that was defined to infer the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate strength . the ice - correction is justified assuming that the ice is part of the obscuring medium _ behind _ the pah emitting region .",
    "the correction is applied only to spectra clearly showing the imprint of water ice absorption , as found among the spectra of classes 2b , 2c , 3a and 3b .",
    "the extent of the correction for individual spectra is indicated in fig.[fig1 ] by horizontal dotted lines .",
    "the ulirgs , seyferts , quasars and starburst galaxies shown in fig.[fig1 ] are not distributed randomly through the diagram . instead , the galaxies appear to be distributed along two branches .",
    "one extending horizontally from the positions of the prototypical seyfert-1 nucleus ngc4151 @xcite to the prototypical starburst nucleus ngc7714 @xcite , the other branch extending diagonally from the prototypical deeply obscured nucleus of ngc4418 @xcite to the starburst nuclei of m82 @xcite and ngc7714 . very few sources are found above and to the right of the diagonal branch and in between the two branches ( the class 2a domain ) .",
    "the three extremes distinguish between agn - heated hot dust spectra ( class 1a ) , pah - dominated spectra ( classes 1c and 2c ) and absorption - dominated spectra ( class 3a ) .",
    "the galaxies lined up along the two branches in between the extremes show signatures of both extremes to varying proportions .",
    "the galaxies along the horizontal branch may be thought of as combinations of agn and starburst activity , while the galaxies along the diagonal branch may be thought of as intermediate stages in between a fully obscured galactic nucleus and an unobscured nuclear starburst .",
    "the latter is illustrated by the two dotted lines in fig.[fig1 ] , which represent mixing lines between the spectrum of ngc4418 on one extreme and either ngc7714 or m82 on the other . the large majority of galaxies on the diagonal branch fall in between these mixing lines .",
    "one notable exception is arp220 .",
    "relatively few galaxies are found in the section between the two branches : the domain of the class 2a sources .",
    "spectroscopically , there are several simple scenarios which will populate this class from adjacent classes .",
    "a class 3a galaxy can be turned into a class 2a galaxy by adding a featureless hot dust continuum to the class 3a absorbed continuum spectrum .",
    "the main effect of this continuum dilution is the filling in of the deep 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature , resulting in a less pronounced feature . increasing the dilution",
    "not only further decreases the depth of the silicate feature but also increases the continuum at 6.2@xmath0 m , resulting in both a less negative silicate strength and a lower 6.2@xmath0 m pah ew .",
    "the effect of this type of continuum dilution is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] by a curved arrow .",
    "alternatively , a class 1a galaxy may be turned into class 2a galaxy by passing its mid - infrared spectrum through a foreground cold dust screen .",
    "the path that a galaxy will take is straight up , since the pah ew is not affected by cold foreground extinction .",
    "the presence of foreground dust or dust mixed in within the pah emitting region may also explain the difference between class 1c and 2c starburst galaxies , and the difference between the classification of the prototypical starburst galaxies ngc7714 and m82 in particular .",
    "in the latter case this may be primarily an orientation effect , as the nuclear starburst in ngc7714 is observed face - on , whereas the starburst ring in m82 is seen under an inclination of @xmath180 degrees .    finally , the complete absence of galaxy spectra classified as 3c must imply that strong , pure foreground , cold dust obscuration is not common in starburst nuclei .",
    "the obscuring dust instead contributes to the continuum underlying the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature , reducing its ew .",
    "we have constructed a diagnostic diagram of two mid - infrared spectral quantities , the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature and the apparent 9.7@xmath0 m silicate strength , for the purpose of classifying infrared galaxies according to their mid - infrared spectral shape ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the large majority of galaxies ( @xmath990% ) are dispersed around two branches : a horizontal one extending from continuum - dominated spectra to pah - dominated spectra and a diagonal one spanned between absorption - dominated spectra and pah - dominated spectra .",
    "seyfert galaxies and quasars ( square plotting symbols in fig.[fig1 ] ) are found exclusively on the horizontal branch characterized by the absence of pronounced silicate features .",
    "starburst galaxy spectra ( triangular plotting symbols ) are concentrated toward the extreme right tip of the two branches , the locus of pah - dominated spectra . of the ulirgs and hylirgs in our sample",
    "( round plotting symbols ) about a quarter occupy the same space as the agns and starbursts in our sample . the large majority ,",
    "however , are distributed along the diagonal branch , characterized by increasingly apparent silicate absorption and less pronounced pah emission features , with deeply obscured galactic nuclei such as ngc4418 @xcite and ngc1377 @xcite as the only non - ulirg , non - seyfert end members on this branch .",
    "note that low - metallicity galaxies ( not included in this study ) would be distributed along the horizontal branch .",
    "the existence of two distinct regimes of apparent silicate absorption , as suggested by the two distinct branches in fig.[fig1 ] , is intriguing and likely points to clear differences in the nuclear dust distribution between galaxies on the two branches .",
    "clumpy distributions produce only shallow absorption features @xcite , and are the likely explanation for the horizontal branch .",
    "the deep silicate absorption found on the slanted branch requires the nuclear source to be deeply embedded in a smooth distribution of dust that is both geometrically and optically thick @xcite .",
    "the transition from clumpy geometry to one dominated by a smooth dust distribution is a possible explanation for the sources located between the branches .",
    "the distribution of ulirg spectra along the full length of both the horizontal and the diagonal branch once again illustrates the diverse nature of the ulirg family .",
    "it , however , also raises the issue of ulirg evolution .",
    "for instance , what evolutionary path has taken iras08572 + 3915 to its extreme class 3a position in which the central power source is deeply buried ?",
    "did the interaction start with both nuclei classified as class 1c/2c starburst galaxies , which then gradually moved up the diagonal branch as the interaction stengthened and more dust accumulated on the remnant nuclei ? and how will iras08572 + 3915 evolve from there , once the obscuring screen breaks up and the hidden power sources are revealed ? in case of a hidden starburst the source likely will move back diagonally toward the starburst locus .",
    "however , if the dominant power source is an agn , will the source cross into the sparsely populated class 2a regime , evolving directly toward the agn - dominated class 1a regime , or will it first undergo a starburst before settling somewhere along the horizontal branch ?",
    "the sparse population of the class 2a domain either indicates that the crossing time is brief  with few ulirgs caught in transformation  or that deeply obscured ulirg nuclei mostly evolve to starbursts ( first ) .    in a more extensive paper ( spoon et al . in preparation ) we will present correlations of additional parameters within the diagram ( e.g. mid - ir line ratios , l@xmath10 , l@xmath11/l@xmath10,absorption features , nuclear separation , optical classification ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank jernimo bernard - salas , nancy levenson , hlne roussel , matthew sirocky , alexander tielens and dan weedman for discussions , and vandana desai for help with the data reduction .",
