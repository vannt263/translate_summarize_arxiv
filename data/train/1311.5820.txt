    "however , it would be misleading to expect that the properties of the orbits as a function of their radius are the same as that of keplerian orbits in a newtonian @xmath137 potential , where the orbital frequency monotonically increases with @xmath107",

    "@xmath143 is always a curve with a zero at the gravity radius @xmath93 , it then monotonically increases , passes through a maximum  except for @xmath124 , when there is a region without circular orbits , so the domain of @xmath144 is not simply connected  and decreases monotonically tending to zero at infinity , @xmath145 for @xmath139 . for @xmath86 , a part of the curve corresponds to unstable orbits .",
    "the ks naked singularity in hoava s gravity has properties which distinguish it from those of the familiar schwarzschild and kerr solutions of gr .",
    "first , since @xmath34 at the singularity has the same value as at infinity , the singularity can be reached by a zero angular momentum test particle dropped from rest at infinity . however ,",
    "if the particle loses some energy on its inbound trajectory , it will be reflected back and will oscillate between two turning points .",

    "since @xmath34 is finite in the neighbourhood of the singularity , @xmath18 being continuous , with @xmath27 ( eq .  [ [ fxks ] ] ) , the effective potential for nonradial motion ( @xmath146 ) will always present an infinite centrifugal barrier , so a particle carrying any angular momentum will never reach the singularity unless it manages to lose its angular momentum without losing energy .",

    "[ fig : omega2-x ] , this would occur only down to the maximum of @xmath144 .",
