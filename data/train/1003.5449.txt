    "the problem of finding geodesics on a surface is a classical subject of differential geometry and analytical mechanics .",
    "generally the exact analytical treatment of the dynamics equations gets quite involved even for comparatively simple surfaces such as ellipsoid ( the well - known result of jacoby , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are interested in the qualitative topological structure of the system s trajectories and their large - scale properties , exact solutions are not necessary . for such purposes we can apply asymptotic methods , which provide a general picture of the system s dynamics .    in the present work we consider surfaces that are obtained by a small deformation of the standard 2d - sphere .",
    "we perform an asymptotic hamiltonian reduction of the dynamics of a particle on such a surface to a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom .",
    "the latter system is always integrable and admits of visual description by means of phase portraits .",
    "the idea underlying the reduction was introduced in @xcite , where a special class of deformed spheres was analyzed in detail .",
    "the key observation is that for small periods of time the trajectory of the particle is close to the exact solution of the unperturbed problem , i.e. a geodesic on the standard sphere ",
    "its great circle .",
    "so , the dynamics of the particle can be approximately described by how the position of this great circle slowly changes in time .    here",
    "we show that the result holds for any small smooth deformation of the sphere and that the procedure of obtaining the hamiltonian of the reduced system consists in applying the funk - minkowski - radon transformation ( see @xcite ) of functions on the 2d - sphere to the function defining the difference of the surface from the sphere .",
    "we consider the motion of a particle on a surface defined by the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 so , the surface is obtained by a small perturbation @xmath2 of the standard sphere .",
    "the motion of a particle with unit mass on the surface can be described by the lagrange equations of the first kind : @xmath3 the lagrange multiplier @xmath4 can be found explicitly @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath7 : @xmath8      the trajectories of the particle have the following shape : small segments turn around the surface close to a plane section of it  a great circle ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . after a period of time",
    "this great circle changes its position on the surface .",
    "so , we can approximately describe the motion of the particle by tracing the slow change of the position of this great circle , thus determining at every moment of time the approximate location of the current loop of the geodesic .",
    "the position of a great circle can be described by a normal vector to it .",
    "it is easy to see that the angular momentum of the particle @xmath9 provides such a normal vector .",
    "its time derivative reads @xmath10 taking into account here only the first order terms in @xmath11 , we can substitute @xmath12 with its zero order component obtained from  ( [ lamb ] ) : @xmath13 ( the constancy follows from conservation of the kinetic energy @xmath14 ) . in what follows",
    "we assume the units to be chosen so that @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 .",
    "we can take advantage of the fact that the system is close to an integrable one ",
    "geodesics on the standard sphere .",
    "this leads to the system having a fast variable  the phase of the motion along the current loop ( close to a great circle ) , and slow variables defining the position of the loop .",
    "the slow variables ( components of the momentum ) are first integrals for the unperturbed system .",
    "so , we are in a position to apply the method of averaging , @xcite . to derive an asymptotic description of the motion of the particle in terms of the evolution of its angular momentum  @xmath17",
    ", we average the above equation over a period of the basic solution ( for the unperturbed sphere ) with a given ( constant ) momentum @xmath17 : @xmath18 where vectors @xmath19 form an orthonormal basis together with @xmath20 ( the exact choice of @xmath19 does not affect the result of averaging ) .",
    "this is the motion along the great circle perpendicular to the momentum @xmath17 .",
    "so , we can see that the above averaging is equivalent to the _ integration of a function on the sphere over great circles _",
    ", i.e. the _ funk transform _",
    "( see @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the above - mentioned unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath17 and to each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the funk transform has the following basic properties :    1 .",
    "linearity : @xmath24 this follows from the linearity of integration .",
    "evenness of the image functions : @xmath25 ( so , the image of the transform is a function on the projective plane ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath17 and @xmath26 are perpendicular to the same great circle .",
    "3 .   zero image of odd functions : if @xmath27 then @xmath28 . indeed ,",
    "for such @xmath29 we have @xmath30    so , averaging of the equation for the momentum ( [ mom ] ) gives @xmath31 where we have denoted the operator @xmath32 .",
    "now we are going to derive the following general identity : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the operator @xmath35 for that end we employ the following property of the funk transform .",
    "the funk transform commutes with the action of three - dimensional rotations .",
    "indeed , for any rotation @xmath36 acting on functions as @xmath37 we have @xmath38 i.e. , we have obtained that @xmath39      now we note that the components of the operator @xmath40 are the infinitesimal rotations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rotation about the axis with number @xmath43 through the angle @xmath44 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath45 we have the rotation matrix @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 at @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49 so , in ( [ rot ] ) , substituting @xmath50 , taking the derivative with respect to @xmath44 , and substituting @xmath51 , we obtain the commutation relation ( [ comm ] ) : @xmath52      this observation enables us to change the places of operators in ( [ momav ] ) : @xmath53 but it is easy to see that @xmath54 acts on a given function @xmath55 as taking its poisson bracket with @xmath17 : @xmath56 where the usual poisson brackets for the components of the momentum are assumed : @xmath57 so , we obtain that the averaged equations for the momentum can be formulated in the following _ hamiltonian form _ : @xmath58 where the hamiltonian is the funk transform of the deformation function : @xmath59",
    "the reduced hamiltonian system has @xmath60 as its first integral ( a casimir function ) , so the phase space is the 2d - sphere . being a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom , it is completely integrable .",
    "the topological structure of the system s dynamics can be studied by means of phase portraits on the sphere @xmath61 .",
    "the trajectories are the contour lines of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is important to note that , in the generic case when the hamiltonian is a morse function , the topological characterization of the phase portrait can be performed using the topological classification of morse functions on the 2d - sphere developed by v.i .",
