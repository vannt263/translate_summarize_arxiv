    "the higgs boson is , for the time being , the only missing ingredient of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions and , by far , the most intriguing one . while it is related to the origin of gauge boson and fermion masses , the mechanism of electroweak breaking is intimately related to the so - called hierarchy problem which has given rise to the ( minimal ) supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) of the sm . in particular the radiative corrections to the squared higgs mass in the sm have a quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff of the theory , @xmath16 , which destabilizes the higgs mass towards the region where the sm is no longer reliable  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is softened in the mssm where the sensitivity to the sm cutoff is only logarithmic and can therefore be interpreted as the renormalization group running from the scale @xmath16 to the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "actually , one of the great successes of the mssm is that the squared higgs mass term can be driven by radiative corrections generated by the top yukawa coupling from positive values at the scale @xmath16 to negative values at the weak scale thus triggering radiative electroweak breaking  @xcite .",
    "still the mssm shows some ( logarithmic ) sensitivity to the cutoff scale @xmath16 , whose value controls the total evolution of the squared higgs mass .",
    "the sensitivity of the squared higgs mass term on the cutoff @xmath16 through radiative corrections can still be softened if the mssm , and in particular the top / stop sector , is living in the bulk of an extra dimensional space of size @xmath17 @xcite . in that case",
    "the radiative corrections to the squared higgs mass term are not sensitive at all to @xmath16 .",
    "in fact they are finite , controlled by the inverse radius @xmath18 of the compactified extra dimensions  , i.e. compactified on the circle of inverse radius @xmath5 , is at the origin of the so - called thermal ( debye ) masses . ] , and with a sign which depends on the spin of the bulk particle circulating in the loop  @xcite .",
    "this observation gave rise to proposing the top / stop ( hyper)multiplet living in the bulk  @xcite as the source of a finite electroweak radiative breaking  , while some explicit examples along that direction have been recently proposed in the frameworks of string  @xcite and field theory in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "another issue which is highly related to the hierarchy problem and electroweak breaking is that of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking must not be hierarchically different from the weak scale since , on the one hand , we do not want to re - create the hierarchy problem , and on the other hand , it should trigger electroweak breaking . because , in the finite radiative electroweak breaking , the weak scale is provided ( apart from loop factors ) by the inverse radius @xmath18 of the compactified extra dimensions , that is the expected order of magnitude for the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "although there are several mechanisms in the literature which can provide the correct order of magnitude for supersymmetry breaking , the one that naturally leads to supersymmetry breaking size of order @xmath18 is the scherk - schwarz ( ss ) mechanism  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact both recent examples of finite radiative electroweak breaking  @xcite use , among other mechanisms , a variant of the ss - mechanism based on a _ discrete _ symmetry of the supersymmetric theory , the @xmath9-parity .    in this paper we will analyze a very simple five dimensional ( 5d ) model where finite electroweak breaking is triggered by the top / stop multiplet living in the bulk of the extra dimension and supersymmetry is broken by a ss - mechanism based on a _ continuous _ symmetry of the 5d supersymmetric theory , @xmath19 .",
    "so , unlike refs .",
    "@xcite supersymmetry breaking is controlled by a continuous parameter , and the supersymmetric limit is continuously attainable . in this sense , and although the theoretical setup of our 5d theory is rather different from those presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , our results can be considered in some aspects as more general than theirs .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will present the model and the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "finite radiative electroweak breaking will be analyzed in section 3 and the higgs sector and supersymmetric spectrum will be presented in sections 4 and 5 , respectively . in section 6 a discussion on unification and non - perturbativity scales will be done and some comments concerning the relation of our paper with refs",
    ".  @xcite will be made . finally in section 7",
    "we will present our conclusions and comparison with recent related works .",
    "in this section we will describe a 5d @xmath0 model whose massless modes constitute the usual four dimensional ( 4d ) @xmath0 mssm , where supersymmetry breaking is a bulk phenomenon induced by the ss - mechanism , and with finite radiative electroweak breaking triggered by the presence of a bulk top / stop hypermultiplet .",
    "the 5d space - time is compactified on @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 parity is acting on the fifth coordinate as @xmath22 .",
    "the orbifold @xmath1 has two fixed points at @xmath23 and the compactified space has two 3-branes located at the fixed points of the orbifold . in this way fields in the theory",
    "can be of two types : those living in the 5d bulk , similar to untwisted states in the heterotic string language ( @xmath3-states ) , and those living on the branes localized at the fixed points of the orbifold , similar to the heterotic string twisted states ( @xmath5-states ) .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that @xmath5-states are localized at the @xmath24 fixed point .",
    "while @xmath3-states feel the fifth dimension , i.e. their wave function depend on @xmath25 , @xmath5-states do not .",
    "vector fields live in the bulk and they are in @xmath6 vector multiplets in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath26 , @xmath27   transform as @xmath19 indices and the complex scalar @xmath28 is defined as , @xmath29 . ] .",
    "matter fields in the bulk are arranged in @xmath6 hypermultiplets , @xmath30   transforms as a doublet under @xmath19 . ] .",
    "@xmath21 , the parity in the fifth dimension , has an appropriate lifting to spinor and @xmath19 indices , such that we can decompose @xmath31 and @xmath32 into _ even _ ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 , and _ odd _ , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath0 superfields   as odd and @xmath36 as even . ] .",
    "after the @xmath21 projection the only surviving zero modes are in @xmath0 vector and chiral multiplets .",
    "if the chiral multiplet @xmath34 is not in a real representation of the gauge group , a multiplet of opposite chirality localized in the 4d boundary @xmath36 can be introduced to cancel anomalies . in order to do that @xmath21 must have a further action on the boundary under which all boundary states are odd  @xcite .",
    "this action can be defined as @xmath37 for the chiral multiplet @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 ( 0 ) for @xmath38 living in the brane ( bulk ) , which creates a selection rule for superpotential interactions on the brane .",
    "the mssm is then made up of zero modes of fields living in the 5d bulk and chiral @xmath0 multiplets in the 4d brane , at localized points of the bulk .",
    "a superpotential interaction can only exist at the brane of the type @xmath7 or @xmath40 to satisfy the orbifold selection rule  @xcite , although the latter , @xmath40 , are expected to have yukawa couplings which are suppressed with respect to those in @xmath7 by a factor @xmath41 , and corresponding to the fact that localized couplings of states propagating in the bulk must be ( volume ) suppressed .    to allow for the mssm superpotential on the brane , @xmath42\\delta(x_5)\\ ] ] and to be consistent with the orbifold selection rule and with a top / stop hypermultiplet propagating in the bulk , to trigger a finite electroweak radiative breaking",
    ", the only solution is that the @xmath2 singlets , @xmath43 propagate in the bulk   violation , which translate into strong bounds on the scale @xmath18  @xcite . ] . in this case",
    "the @xmath2 doublets @xmath44 are localized on the brane and transform as chiral @xmath0 multiplets   are living in the bulk and matter singlets and higgs doublets @xmath45 are localized on the brane .",
    "this possibility looks less natural and will not be explicitly considered in this paper , although it leads to results very similar to those that will be found .",
    "it also leads to a drawback in the supersymmetric spectrum concerning the lightest supersymmetric particle , as we will comment later on . ] .",
    "since both higgs fields are on the brane , the @xmath46-parameter does not arise through compactification  @xcite and , although it is an allowed term in the superpotential , one has to consider it as an effective parameter and rely on its generation as a result of the integration of the massive states of the underlying ( supergravity or string ) theory   in the bulk acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) by radiative corrections induced by another field , in a similar way to the one by which the top / stop sector makes the higgs field to acquire a vev in this paper .",
    "of course this situation requires enlarging the mssm to the nmssm and the higgs sector gets mixed with the singlet states  @xcite . ] . in this sense",
    "the situation is no better than in the usual mssm , except for the fact that the cutoff of the theory , @xmath16 , the scale at which the structure of the underlying theory should be considered , is at most two orders of magnitude larger that the scale of supersymmetry breaking and therefore a modest suppression should be sufficient for phenomenological purposes .",
    "after compactification on @xmath1 the zero mode of the vector multiplet @xmath47 is just the 4d mssm @xmath0 vector multiplet @xmath48 , while the massive modes are the massive 4d @xmath6 vector multiplets @xmath49 , with a mass @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are majorana spinors .",
    "similarly the zero mode of matter hypermultiplets @xmath52 is the 4d @xmath0 chiral multiplet @xmath53 , while the massive modes are 4d @xmath6 hypermultiplets , @xmath54 , with a mass @xmath50 , where @xmath55 is a dirac spinor with components @xmath56 .",
    "finally , the chiral fields which are localized on the brane are massless , except for the supersymmetric mass term @xmath46 introduced in the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) that gives a common mass to higgs bosons and higgsinos .",
    "supersymmetry breaking was performed in refs .",
    "@xcite using the ss mechanism based on the subgroup @xmath8 which survives after the orbifold action @xmath1 . using the @xmath9-symmetry @xmath8 with parameter @xmath57 to impose different boundary conditions for bosons and fermions inside the 5d @xmath0 multiplets ,",
    "one obtains for the @xmath58-th kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode of gauge bosons and chiral fermions living in the bulk the compactification mass @xmath50 , while for the @xmath58-th mode of gauginos , @xmath59 , and supersymmetric partners of chiral fermions living in the bulk , @xmath60 the mass @xmath61 .",
    "notice that for the particular case @xmath62 the gauginos @xmath59 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , are degenerate in mass and constitute a dirac fermion .",
    "a detailed discussion was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of gauginos . for matter scalars in hypermultiplets ,",
    "@xmath65 , that transform under the subgroup @xmath8 we can write the ss boundary conditions as , @xmath66 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\varphi_r \\\\ \\varphi_l \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are even ( odd ) periodic functions @xmath69 . making a fourier expansion along the @xmath25 direction with coefficients @xmath70 we can write : @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the mass eigenstates modes .",
    "in this way the mssm states , made out of bulk zero modes and localized states , acquire tree - level masses : gauge bosons , right - handed fermions and left - handed chiral multiplets localized on the brane are massless ; gauginos and right - handed sfermions are massive , with masses @xmath73 ; higgs bosons and higgsinos , localized on the brane , are massive with a common supersymmetric mass @xmath46 .",
    "since the higgs bosons have a positive squared mass @xmath74 , electroweak symmetry is preserved at the tree - level .",
    "however , we will see in the next section how this tree - level mass pattern , along with the yukawa couplings contained in the superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) , and in particular the top yukawa coupling @xmath75 , will be able to break radiatively the electroweak symmetry and provide a well defined spectrum for the higgs masses and the masses of the supersymmetric partners localized on the brane .",
    "the higgs potential along the direction of the neutral components of the fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be written as , @xmath78 where the supersymmetric tree - level relations @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 hold .",
    "these relations are spoiled by radiative corrections which provide contributions to all the above parameters .",
    "these corrections are driven by the @xmath82 gauge couplings @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and by the top and bottom yukawa couplings , defined as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 are the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , @xmath88 gev , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the top and bottom running masses .",
    "notice that @xmath91 can become important only for large values of @xmath92 , as those that will be found by minimization of the one - loop effective potential .",
    "we will consider the leading radiative corrections : in particular @xmath93-corrections to the quadratic terms which are zero at the tree - level ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath95 corrections to the quartic terms which are @xmath96 at the tree - level .",
    "for this reason we will not consider any radiative term as @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ potencial ] ) and neglect @xmath98-radiative corrections in the numerical analysis .",
    "all radiative corrections to the potential parameters in ( [ potencial ] ) will depend on @xmath18 and @xmath57 .",

    "in this section we will comment on the sensitivity of the model to the sector of the theory beyond the scale @xmath18 .",
    "it is a well known fact  @xcite that , because of the non - renormalizability of the 5d theory , the gauge and yukawa couplings run with a power law behaviour of the scale .",
    "this idea was on the basis of the so - called `` accelerated '' unification proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently analyzed in different papers  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , the gauge and yukawa coupling one - loop renormalization for the model analyzed in this paper were studied in refs .",

    "we have run the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) from @xmath207 to scales @xmath208 using , for @xmath209 the sm beta functions for gauge and yukawa couplings   tev . ] , those of the mssm for @xmath210 , and those in eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) for scales @xmath208 .",
    "we have chosen for the plot @xmath211 and @xmath212 tev .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] where we plot the gauge couplings @xmath213 , @xmath174 ( solid curves in the left panel ) and the yukawa couplings @xmath214 ( right panel ) .",
    "we see that all couplings , except @xmath215 , are asymptotically free and , as a consequence , in the region @xmath216 shown in the plots the theory is weakly coupled . for @xmath217",
    ", @xmath215 keeps on growing and for @xmath218 the theory becomes strongly coupled .",
    "we can compare here the above scales with those obtained in models  @xcite where all sm particles are propagating in the bulk .",
    "there are two main differences :    * the first important difference concerns the running of the qcd gauge coupling , @xmath181 . in our case there is no linear running in @xmath219 because only half of the sm @xmath220 triplets ( the right - handed ones ) are propagating in the bulk which leads to cancellation of the coefficient of the linear term in @xmath219 . when also the left - handed triplets propagate in the bulk",
    "there is an extra contribution to the @xmath220 @xmath202-function as @xmath221 which makes @xmath181 to increase with the scale and become non - perturbative at @xmath222 , depending on the value of @xmath18   is asymptotically free in the sm , the smaller @xmath18 the larger @xmath223 and the smaller @xmath224 . ] .",
    "however in our case we have seen that only @xmath215 is non - asymptotically free and has a linear running , which translates into a much larger non - perturbative scale @xmath225 . * the second important difference concerns the running of yukawa couplings . as a consequence of the superpotential structure @xmath7 the @xmath202-functions of the yukawa couplings are governed by the anomalous dimensions of fields in the brane .",
    "these anomalous dimensions involve a single @xmath3-field propagating in the loop , which makes their scale dependence linear . on the other hand , theories with all matter fields propagating in the bulk rely on localized yukawa couplings with a superpotential structure of the type @xmath40 . in that case",
    "the one - loop anomalous dimensions involve two @xmath3-fields propagating in the loop , which makes the scale dependence yukawa @xmath202-functions quadratic and worsens the perturbative behaviour of yukawa couplings .",
    "in fact we have seen that , while in our case the top and bottom yukawa couplings are one - loop asymptotically free , in theories with all sm fields in the bulk they become non - perturbative at scales @xmath226  @xcite .",
    "finally we can see from the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] that the theory does not unify .",
    "this issue was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that by adding two zero hypercharge triplets   propagating in the bulk , and contributing to the @xmath202-functions @xmath227 , the theory unifies at @xmath228 .",
    "the running of @xmath229 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] ( left pannel ) in dashed where unification is explicit .",
    "of course sensitivity with the scale is large and to draw firm conclusions on unification predictions we should control all threshold effect at the scale @xmath230 from the underlying ( string ) theory .",
    "in this paper we have presented a 5d model with the fifth dimension compactified on the orbifold @xmath1 , where the parity @xmath21 is defined by @xmath231 and an appropriate lifting to spinor and @xmath19 indices .",
    "the gauge bosons are propagating in the bulk ( @xmath3-states ) while matter and higgs fields can either propagate in the bulk or be localized on the 3-branes at the orbifold fixed points ( @xmath5-states ) .",
    "the orbifold selection rules allow superpotential interactions on the branes of the type @xmath40 and @xmath7 , where the former are suppressed as @xmath232 with respect to the latter .",
    "we then assume a superpotential of the form @xmath7 .",
    "radiative finite electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by right - handed stops propagating in the bulk , where supersymmetry is broken by a scherk - schwarz mechanism that uses the @xmath8 subgroup of the @xmath19 ( @xmath9-symmetry ) left unbroken by the compactification .",
    "the scherk - schwarz parameter @xmath57 is considered as a free parameter in this paper . to allow fermion masses and superpotential interactions on the brane ,",
    "consistent with the orbifold selection rules , we must assume that @xmath2 singlets propagate in the bulk while @xmath2 doublets are localized on the 3-brane , e.g. at the fixed point @xmath24 .",
    "in this way the 4d theory of zero modes and localized states constitute the mssm ( @xmath0 ) , while that of massive modes possesses @xmath6 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "the higgs sector is localized on the brane and then the @xmath46-parameter does not arise through compactification , although it is an allowed term in the superpotential .",
    "one has to consider it as an effective parameter from the underlying , supergravity or string , theory . in this sense",
    "the situation is better than in the mssm since the cutoff @xmath16 is in the tev range .",
    "we have proven that electroweak breaking is induced by finite radiative corrections triggered by the top / stop sector , @xmath46 and @xmath57 remaining as the only free parameters .",
    "in fact , the compactification radius and @xmath138 are fixed by the minimization procedure . while @xmath138 is large , @xmath233",
    ", @xmath18 is in the range , @xmath234 tev , depending on the values of @xmath46 and @xmath57 .",
    "the lightest higgs mass is similar to the mssm one  @xcite for large @xmath92 , in particular for large values of @xmath18 for which the heavy kk - modes can be integrated out .",
    "we have checked that their integration produces threshold effects that increase the lightest higgs mass by an amount @xmath235 gev so we expect that once we include the genuine mssm two - loop corrections  @xcite the final value predicted for the model will not differ much from the mssm one .",
    "on the other hand lep searches on the mssm higgs sector imply ( @xmath57 dependent ) lower bounds on the @xmath46 parameter and the mass of the sm - like higgs , @xmath148 .",
    "they translate into the absolute bounds @xmath236 gev and @xmath237 gev .",
    "the supersymmetric mass spectrum has a well defined pattern .",
    "the heaviest states are right - handed sfermions , the gauginos and the gravitino , with a mass @xmath238 , and higgsinos , with a mass @xmath239 .",
    "the other supersymmetric partners ( left - handed sfermions ) receive radiative masses from the supersymmetry breaking in the bulk .",
    "the next to heaviest states are the left - handed squarks which receive radiative masses from the gluon / gluino sector .",
    "we have found that the lightest supersymmetric particles are the sneutrinos , and the next to lightest supersymmetric particles the charged sleptons , with a squared mass difference between them @xmath13 .    the gauge and yukawa couplings run linearly with the scale @xmath46 ( a reflection of the non - renormalizability of the 5d theory ) .",
    "the theory remains perturbative for scales @xmath240 while @xmath215 and @xmath241 unify at @xmath242 .",
    "this is a great difference with respect to recently proposed models , where all particles propagate in the bulk  @xcite and that rely on superpotential interactions of the type @xmath40 . in this case wave function renormalization",
    "involves one - loop diagrams with two bulk states propagating and vertices that do not conserve the kk - number .",
    "this translates into quadratic running for the yukawa couplings and make the theory non - perturbative for @xmath243 . since all properties of the theory rely on summing over the infinite tower of kk states , having such a low cutoff is a drawback which can make threshold effects from heavy kk - modes non - negligible .    concerning the recent related works already mentioned , ref .",
    "@xcite uses a single higgs hypermultiplet in the bulk and all matter fields propagating in the bulk .",
    "it breaks @xmath0 supersymmetry by a ss - mechanism using @xmath9-parity as the global symmetry , which amounts to choosing @xmath62 as the ss - parameter . on the one hand , since they have a single higgs field , they solve the @xmath46-problem by nullification . on the other hand",
    ", they have to rely on @xmath40 yukawa couplings to give masses to quarks and leptons , which makes , as we noticed above , the theory non - perturbative for low scales .",
    "the prediction on the higgs mass ( @xmath167 128 gev ) is reached by our model for the particular case @xmath62 , @xmath244 , although this is a non - physical point for our theory .",
    "finally the lsp in ref .",
    "@xcite is the stop , also making a big difference with respect to our theory which predicts the sneutrino as the lsp .",
    "concerning ref .",
    "@xcite , its authors use two higgs multiplets ( either in the bulk or localized on the brane ) and also all matter fields propagating in the bulk .",
    "supersymmetry is broken by the ss - mechanism using @xmath9-parity , i.e. again @xmath62  . since massive gauginos form dirac fermions",
    ", they can not generate radiatively the @xmath245 term in the potential and this model has to rely on non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential , as @xmath246 that , along with the @xmath46-term , generate the @xmath94-parameter , which then gets a sensitivity to the cutoff scale , at the tree level . also yukawa couplings",
    "renormalize quadratically with the scale and so the theory becomes non - perturbative at low scales .",
    "let us finally conclude by emphasizing the beauty of the mechanism of electroweak breaking triggered by a top - quark propagating in the bulk of an extra dimension . in our opinion it constitutes a step forward in our understanding of electroweak breaking since the generated higgs field instability at the origin is neither `` imposed '' by hand at tree - level nor sensitive to the standard model cutoff , in spite of its radiative origin .",
    "of course the top - quark propagation in the bulk is not without phenomenological consequences  @xcite , that should be worked out in future works and must be tested in future colliders . on the other hand , the pattern of supersymmetric mass spectrum should give a hint on the particular mechanism of supersymmetry breaking realized by the nature .",
