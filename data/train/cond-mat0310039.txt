    "it is seen from the figure that there is at least one order of magnitude difference between the two curves : @xmath61 obtained from the perturbation method is much larger than the one from the exact diagonalization method . moreover , the trends of the magnetic field dependence are also different .",
    "we point out that these differences arise from the fact that only the first order of the perturbation is applied .",
    "it can be fixed if one further includes the second order correction in @xmath97 , _ ie .",

    "we notice that the diagonalization above includes only the lowest four levels .",

    "@xmath61 calculated from the exact diagonalization method is plotted in also fig .  1 against the magnetic field ( curve with @xmath101 )",
    "strikingly , it is _ orders of magnitude _ larger than that from the perturbation .    in order to understand this huge difference",
    ", now we include _ six _ lowest energy levels of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , as basis functions in the perturbation method .",
    "the wavefunctions of the lowest two states of @xmath26 are therefore given by @xmath108 in which @xmath109 the energy difference between @xmath110 and @xmath111 now becomes @xmath112 the corresponding srt @xmath61 is hence given by @xmath113 the numerical results of eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplify_6 ] ) are plotted by the curve with @xmath114 in fig .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the inclusion of the additional basis functions in the perturbation method also greatly enhances the srt by orders of magnitude .",
    "the results obtained from the exact diagonalization method with the same lowest six levels as basis are given by the curve with @xmath115 .",
    "the two curves are almost the same , and much closer to the final converged results ( curve marked with @xmath101 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen from the above calculation that the perturbation approach widely used in the literature is _ inadequate _ in describing the srt even with the second order energy corrections included . in principal in order to use the perturbation method to calculate the srt",
    ", one has to include sufficient number of the states in the basis in stead of only the lowest four levels widely used in the literature .",
    "this is of course inapplicable especially for larger qd s or higher temperature where one has to include a lot of basis functions ( for a qd of @xmath72  nm , one has to use 100 levels as basis functions ) and the srt is determined by many levels ( in stead of only the lowest two ) of the total electron hamiltonian @xmath26 . even for the lowest two levels ( for a qd with @xmath71  nm at 4  k ,",
    "the srt is determined by the lowest two levels of the total electron hamiltonian @xmath26 ) , one has to use a lot of basis functions to converge the energy and the resulting srt between these two levels is therefore strongly readjusted .",
    "this is because the spin - orbit coupling is very strong in mixing different energy levels of @xmath0 .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we therefore reinvestigate the properties of the srt based on the exact diagonalization calculation .      as pointed out in the previous subsection that for a qd with @xmath71  nm , at @xmath1  k the srt is determined by the spin - flip transition between the lowest two energy levels after the _ exact diagonalization _ , although at least 12 energy levels in the hilbert space of @xmath0 are essential in getting these two levels . in this subsection",
    "we focus on the effects of the external fields on the srt determined by these two levels .",
    "it is seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : simplify ] ) and ( [ eq : simplify_6 ] ) that in a given basis the spin relaxation rate @xmath116 is determined by two competing trends as a function of the energy splitting @xmath117 : ( i ) @xmath118 , which increases with @xmath97 in the present case , and ( ii ) @xmath119 , which decreases with @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the srt can be uniquely determined by the energy @xmath97 .",
    "for small @xmath117 , it is easy to see that the trend ( i ) dominates the when @xmath120 , which is 0.57  mev at @xmath71  nm .",
    "that is , the srt decreases with @xmath97 when @xmath121  mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] the srt is plotted against the applied magnetic field @xmath66 .",
    "it is seen from the figure that @xmath61 decreases with the applied magnetic field .",
    "this is understood from the fact that the energy splitting @xmath97 increases with the applied magnetic field as shown in the inset . moreover , even for the largest energy splitting 0.04  mev at @xmath69  t , it is one order of magnitude smaller than 0.57  mev , energy splitting required to have the opposite @xmath61-@xmath66 dependence .",
    "we investigate the magnetic field dependence of the srt for different diameters of the qd s at two different temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bt ] . unlike the previous subsection where only the lowest two energy levels are important , here for most cases one has to include many levels of the total electron hamiltonian .",
    "it is seen that the srt decreases rapidly with the magnetic field at each dot size and temperature .",
    "this feature is quite opposite to the bulk,@xcite the two-@xcite and the one - dimensional@xcite cases where the srt always increases with the magnetic field .",
    "this is because in the dot case there are only discrete energy levels and the magnetic field helps to increase the spin - flip scattering as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "moreover , one notices that the srt drops dramatically with the dot size . for a dot with @xmath72  nm ,",
    "the srt is more than 6 orders of magnitude faster than the one with @xmath71  nm .",
    "this is understood that for larger dots , more energy levels are engaged in the spin - flip scattering and hence sharply reduce the srt .",
    "we plot the srt as a function of the temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : td ] for a qd with @xmath122  nm under three different magnetic fields . from the figure",
    "one finds that the srt gets smaller with the increase of the temperature .",
    "moreover , the smaller the magnetic field is , the faster the srt drops with the temperature .",
    "these features can be understood as follows : with the increase of the temperature , the phonon number @xmath58 gets larger .",
    "this enhances the electron - phonon scattering and leads to the larger transition probability .",
    "moreover , unlike the previous work@xcite where the difference between zero temperature and finite temperatures is just the phonon bose distribution , we stress that for high temperatures , the occupation to the high energy levels becomes important and it is inadequate to consider only the lowest several levels . for lower magnetic fields , the space between different energy levels is smaller . therefore , more levels are included in the energy regime determined by @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : srt ] ) which leads to a faster response to the temperature .",
    "this feature is more pronounced in the low temperature regime . for high temperatures , as there are already many levels included in the energy space , adding a few more levels does not change the srt significantly .",
    "consequently the rates of the decrease of the srt with the temperature become similar for different magnetic fields when @xmath124  k.      as the qds are confined in the quantum well , it is necessary to study the quantum well width dependence of the srt as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ad ] where @xmath61 is plotted as a function of the well width @xmath3 for different temperatures at b=1  t. it is noted that the srt increases with the well width @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spin - orbit coupling @xmath16 [ eq .  ( [ so ] ) ] is proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "smaller well width corresponds to larger spin - orbit coupling and therefore smaller srt .",
    "we point out here that the well width in the present calculation is much smaller than the dot size @xmath126 and only the lowest subband contributes to the srt . for larger well width ,",
    "more subbands are involved and hence there adds an opposite tendency for a shorter srt with the increase of the well width .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the srt in gaas qds by the exact diagonalization method with applied magnetic fields . after comparing the exact diagonalization method with the perturbation approach widely used in the literature , we find that the later is inadequate in accounting for the electron structure and the srt in qds .",
    "this is because that the energy splitting caused by the spin - orbit coupling is several times large than the zeeman splitting used in the perturbation approach .",
    "moreover , a lot more energy levels of @xmath0 are coupled by the spin - orbit coupling and therefore contribute to the lowest energy levels of the total qd hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore reinvestigated the srt from the exact diagonalization method to explore its dependence on the magnetic filed , the temperature and the size of the qd .",
    "we find the srt decreases with the magnetic field , which is quite opposite to the bulk , the two- and one- dimensional cases .",
    "it also decreases with the diameter of the qd , but increases with the width of the quantum well on which the qd grows .",
    "for high temperature , the srt becomes much faster due to the stronger electron - phonon scattering and the wider range of energy space the electron occupies .",
    "all our investigation suggests the importance of the exact calculation of the energy structure .",
