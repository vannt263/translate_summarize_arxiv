    "finite temperature investigations of spontaneously broken gauge theories are of importance to the physics of the very early universe .",
    "two prime examples are the inflationary universe and the generation of the baryon asymmetry . although symmetry restoring phase transitions in spontaneously broken gauge theories are crucial for these areas , our knowledge about them comes chiefly from perturbation theory .",
    "motivated by the desire to learn more about their non - perturbative aspects , lattice investigations@xcite of these theories at finite temperature have been made .",
    "our investigation of the @xmath0 spin model on anisotropic lattices is one more step in this direction .",
    "recall that this model is obtained from the fundamental @xmath9 higgs - gauge model in its weak gauge coupling limit .",
    "both the models are expected to be trivial , giving rise to an upper bound on the higgs mass in their respective scaling regions .",
    "the finite temperature investigation is aimed at studying the model in this scaling region to find out about the symmetry restoring phase transition and to obtain a lower bound on the symmetry restoration temperature @xmath2 .",
    "employing anisotropic lattices has the advantage of being able to distinguish the finite temperature effects , which could be called as a special type of finite size effects , from arbitrary finite size effects since the former have to be independent of the anisotropy in the scaling region .",
    "in addition , anisotropic lattices allow one to study the finite temperature effects at a correlation length of order unity .",
    "on anisotropic lattices @xmath10 , the @xmath11 spin model is defined by the action @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15(or @xmath16 for @xmath0 ) is the coupling on the isotropic lattices for which the anisotropy coupling @xmath17 is unity .",
    "the physical volume and temperature are respectively given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 . since @xmath20 , varying @xmath21 on the lattices above amounts to holding the temperature constant in units of @xmath22 , apart from possible quantum renormalization effects .",
    "in both the large @xmath1 approximation and the numerical simulations our procedure to investigate finite temperature effects was the following .",
    "for a given value of the anisotropy coupling @xmath17 , we obtained the critical coupling on an @xmath10 lattice by setting @xmath17 to its classical value @xmath21 .",
    "our results justify this choice _ a posteriori_. @xmath23 in the large @xmath1 limit is obtained by solving numerically the saddle point equation @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with the momenta @xmath28 given by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the prime on the sum in eq .",
    "( 2 ) indicates that the zero mode , @xmath33 , is being left out . in monte carlo(mc ) simulations the unique crossing point of the cumulant @xmath34 for various volumes @xmath35 yields @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the order parameter , defined by @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , one may use the peak position of the susceptibility , @xmath39 , to define @xmath40 . using the critical exponents of the @xmath0 model in three dimensions , @xmath36",
    "can then be obtained using the finite size scaling theory .",
    "the higgs mass at zero temperature was then determined at the @xmath36 by studying the zero momentum connected correlation functions of the spin variables on @xmath41 lattices in both the spatial and the temporal directions . from the exponential fall - off of the correlation functions , the higgs mass , @xmath42 ,",
    "can be obtained using standard methods , such as fits or local distance dependent masses .",
    "demanding euclidean invariance and by appropriately scaling the temporal direction to match these correlation functions , we determined corrections to the relation @xmath43 .",
    "they were found to be 5 - 10% for all @xmath17-values we studied , indicating that the quantum corrections to the anisotropy are small .",
    "the same conclusion was also obtained in the large @xmath1 limit in the symmetric phase .",
    "1 exhibits our results for both @xmath44 and @xmath45 on @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattices for @xmath48 .",
    "we used the spectral density method to obtain the smooth curves shown from our data , shown by crosses .",
    "similar results have also been obtained for other values of @xmath21 and @xmath49 .",
    "we have used @xmath50 , 1.5 and 2 , @xmath51 , 4 , 6 and @xmath52 and 24 . in each case",
    "we obtained @xmath36 by using both the crossing point of @xmath44 and the finite size scaling of the peak position of the susceptibility .",
    "both estimates were always found to be consistent , although we preferred to use the former for determining @xmath3 .       at each coupling",
    ", the higgs mass @xmath3 was obtained from the plateau in the local distance - dependent masses , defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the zero momentum correlation function .",
    "again we checked that a fit to the data of an exponential form yielded consistent results with these estimates . using these results ,",
    "the ratio @xmath55 shown in table 1 is obtained for various @xmath21 and @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath21-independence of the ratio is obvious .",
    "recall that @xmath56 , as one approaches @xmath57 , i.e. , as @xmath49 grows .",
    "thus , depending on the choice of value of the correlation length up to which an effective theory can be defined , one obtains a lower bound on the ratio @xmath5 . from table 1 , one sees this bound to be @xmath4 for a correlation length of @xmath58 2 , which decreases by 10% for @xmath8    considering the fluctuations around the saddle point of the large @xmath1 limit , one can obtain the higgs mass @xmath3 at @xmath59 , while the corresponding renormalized vacuum expectation value of the field is given by @xmath60 .",
    "2 shows these large @xmath1 results for @xmath5 and @xmath61 .",
    "both are seen to be clearly independent of @xmath21 .",
    "further , the latter seems to be independent of @xmath49 for @xmath62 .",
    "qualitatively , the large @xmath1 limit seems to reproduce all the features of the monte carlo(mc ) data well .",
    "however , quantitatively , the large @xmath1 results seem to lie systematically lower than the mc results by @xmath5815 %",
    ". it would be interesting to check whether the early scaling evident in the mc data for @xmath51 is real by simulating the theory at more @xmath21 values and also by studying the @xmath63 ratio .",
