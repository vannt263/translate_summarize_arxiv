    "the transverse degree of freedom of an optical field is the fundamental aspect of light that contains spatial information .",
    "utilization of this information is the basic resource in traditional imaging systems and in applications such as microscopy , lithography , holography or metrology .",
    "in addition , use of the transverse modes of light has recently been demonstrated to be an important resource in optical communication  @xcite , high - dimensional entanglement studies  @xcite , and quantum key distribution  @xcite .",
    "having control of the spatial coherence properties of a light beam provides an additional degree of control compared to using fully coherent light only , and has been shown to be advantageous for a number of applications .",
    "beams of decreased coherence allow access to spatial frequencies that are twice those available in a purely coherent system  @xcite .",
    "greater spatial frequencies can enable improvements in imaging based systems and has been shown to be particularly useful in lithography  @xcite .",
    "partial coherence also allows for the suppression of unwanted coherent effects by decreasing the coherence , such as suppression of speckle  @xcite which enables lower noise and opens the door to novel imaging modalities  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that partial coherence can improve the deleterious effects of optical propagation through random or turbulent media  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coherent property of optical beams can be used for novel beam shaping  @xcite as well as a method for control over soliton formation due to modulation instabilities in the study of nonlinear beam dynamics  @xcite . the ability to generate arbitrary optical beams",
    "could also be used as a tool in basic research , such as in optical propagation  @xcite or testing of novel methods in quantum state tomography dealing with the transverse wavefunction of light that has seen a great deal of interest recently  @xcite .",
    "traditional methods used to generate partially coherent beams of light often rely on imprinting a changing pattern of random phase or speckle onto a coherent beam , such as with a spatial light modulator ( slm )  @xcite or rotating diffuser  @xcite .",
    "it has even been demonstrated that slms allow the statistics of the speckle patterns to be varied across the beam to give spatially varying coherence properties  @xcite .",
    "however none of these methods have been shown to allow for complete arbitrary control over the spatial coherence of an optical beam .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how to generate any arbitrary quasi - monochromatic partially coherent field that can be specified by a cross - spectral density function @xmath1 , i.e. for fields fully specified by their two point spatial correlations .",
    "this is done by first computing the coherent mode decomposition of @xmath1 , which is an incoherent mixture of orthogonal coherent modes . for each of these coherent modes a computer generated hologram ( cgh )",
    "is computed for a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) that acts as a binary amplitude spatial light modulator with rapid modulation speeds .",
    "the dmd then switches between each coherent mode on timescales slower than the coherence time of the source laser , but long relative to the detection time of the ccd .",
    "this creates an incoherent averaging that physically reproduces the coherent mode decomposition .",
    "section  [ sec : coherentmodedecomposition ] details computation of the coherent mode decomposition , section  [ sec : binarygratings ] describes the algorithm to compute binary amplitude cghs for the generation of coherent modes and section  [ sec : experiment ] details the experimental demonstration of this technique .",
    "the transverse wavefront of a deterministic and coherent scalar beam is described by a complex field , @xmath2 . for a stochastic beam",
    ", @xmath2 is a random variable and it becomes necessary to represent the field in a more sophisticated way .",
    "the standard way of doing this is with the cross - spectral density function . at a single frequency",
    "the cross - spectral density function is defined as @xmath3 and represents the average intensity ( @xmath4 ) , as well as the correlations ( up to second order ) of such a partially coherent field  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 can be decomposed into an incoherent sum of orthogonal spatial modes @xmath5 , written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 are real and nonnegative , and @xmath8 is the relative weight of the field in mode @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the modes @xmath5 can be computed as the eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath7 from the fredholm integral equation @xmath9    this representation is often referred to as a coherent mode decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically eq .",
    "[ eq : decomposition ] is a sum over an infinite number of modes , but in practice @xmath10 is bounded by the maximum spatial frequency content of @xmath1 , i.e. there is some maximum @xmath11 such that for @xmath12 , @xmath13 will be negligibly small .",
    "for example , gaussian schell - model beams are a common example of a partially coherent beam .",
    "such a beam is defined by having a gaussian intensity @xmath14 , as well as a gaussian degree of coherence @xmath15 , which gives a cross - spectral density function @xmath16 a coherent mode decomposition of such a gaussian schell - model beam shows that the number of coherent modes necessary to describe eq .",

    "[ eq : decomposition ] can be realized if one can create a beam that alternates between the coherent modes @xmath5 in time with relative frequency weighted by @xmath13 . for measurement to yield the intended field",
    ", the switching time @xmath18 must be much faster than any detector integration time @xmath19 in order to create the intended averaging over the inputs .",
    "in addition , for the mixture to be an incoherent mixture , the various modes must not have any correlations in time .",
    "thus the switching time must be slower than the coherence time @xmath20 of the source .",
    "together these form the condition @xmath21 if eq .",
    "[ eqn : coherencetimes ] is met , then one has a physically realized implementation of @xmath1 .",

    "such rapid mode generation was recently demonstrated by using dmds to create quickly addressable binary amplitude modulated cghs  @xcite , though this comes at the cost of having a maximum efficiency around 10% .",
    "dmds are devices that provide both the speed and resolution desired for rapid generation and switching of coherent fields  @xcite .",
    "a dmd consists of a 2-dimensional array of mirrors that can be in one of two positions , which can be used to act as an on or off state at each pixel .",
