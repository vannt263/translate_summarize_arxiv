    "the electronic phase stability of the cbi system is better than 10 deg over the timescales between primary phase calibrations .",
    "however the pointing accuracy of the mount is approximately 0.5 arcmin root - mean - square ( rms ) . due to the co - mounted nature of the cbi antennas this appears as correlated phase errors in the visibilities and translates to an equivalent pointing uncertainty in the map",
    ". the pointing error can be measured , and removed , by interleaved observations of a nearby phase calibrator . for the cbi observations on 2004 dec 20 , the calibrator j0541 - 051 was observed , and the resulting pointing error correction was 62 arcsec . for the cbi2 observations no sufficiently bright calibrator was observed .",
    "we note that these pointing errors and corrections are in any case a small fraction of the synthesised beam size ( 6 arcmin for cbi and 4.5 arcmin for cbi2 ) and do not significantly affect the positional matching of features in the cbi maps with data at other wavelengths described below ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we use these infrared data to test for correlation between the 31  ghz emission and the emission from interstellar dust . the mid - ir emission at 12  @xmath6 m",
    "is thought to be produced by stochastic heating of very small grains ( vsgs ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the heat capacity of these grains is small enough so that the absorption of a single uv photon will increase its temperature to above 100 k , but their small cross section makes it unlikely that they encounter many simultaneously .",
    "thus vsgs are not in equilibrium with the radiation field . at longer ir wavelengths , ( such as in the 60 and 100  @xmath6 m iris bands )",
    ", the emission is due to classical grains at @xmath44 k.    the resolution of the iris data is not fine enough to allow a comparison with cbi2 . to trace small - scale structure ,",
    "that could be compared with the improved resolution of cbi2 , we used archival data acquired with the irac instrument aboard the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "this image is taken at 8  @xmath6 m and traces vsgs and pahs , like iris at 12  @xmath6 m , but with a finer resolution of 4@xmath45 that allows proper point - source subtraction and comparison with cbi2 data .",
    "the irac image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tript]a .",
    "point sources from irac were subtracted using a median filter . for the remaining sources , they were subtracted individually by fitting a gaussian to the source and then subtracting it .",
    "cbi observations were simulated on both the iris and irac images using the mockcbi package ( pearson 2000 , private communication ) , in order to have equivalent visibility sampling when comparing with cbi and cbi2 images .",
    "this will remove any uniform background from iris and irac . when simulating irac data we embedded the image in a background taken from iris 12  @xmath6 m , to extend the field of the irac 8  @xmath6 m mosaic to at least 3 times the size of the primary beam .",
    "when embedding irac  8  @xmath6 m in iris 12  @xmath6 m we fitted a plane to the difference of emission from the border of the images in order to remove most of the discontinuities and to remove the contribution from zodiacal light in the 8  @xmath6 m image ( iris images have only residual contribution from zodiacal light ) .",
    "the simulation is also useful to acquire visibility - plane data , which we used to make linear correlations to obtain a quantitative comparison between dust and 31  ghz emission .",
    "the simulations obtained will hereafter be referred to as cbi - simulated or cbi2-simulated images .",
    "we also carried out a morphological comparison of the cbi2 data with pmn ( at 4.85 ghz ) ( * ? ? ? * with a resolution of 4.1@xmath2 , see sec .",
