    "<S> unknown quantum information can not be perfectly copied ( cloned ) . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is the bedrock of quantum technologies and quantum cryptography , including the seminal scheme of wiesner s quantum money@xcite , which was the first quantum - cryptographic proposal . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , to our knowledge , quantum money has not been tested experimentally yet . here </S>",
    "<S> , we experimentally revisit the wiesner idea , assuming a banknote to be an image encoded in the polarization states of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it is possible to use quantum states to prepare a banknote that can not be ideally copied without making the owner aware of only unauthorized actions . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the security conditions for quantum money by investigating the physically - achievable limits on the fidelity of 1-to-2 copying of arbitrary sequences of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be applied as a security measure in quantum digital right management .    </S>",
    "<S> the seminal proposal of quantum money by wiesner@xcite ( see also ref .  [ ] ) , followed by the introduction of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols by bennet and brassard@xcite and by ekert@xcite , have triggered a breathtaking interest and progress not only in quantum cryptography but , in general , in quantum information over the last three decades . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising that refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] on qkd are among the most often cited works in quantum information and both quantum and classical cryptography . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , various commercial implementations of qkd protocols ( for a recent review see  [ ] ) , together with quantum random - number generators and the d - wave machine ( see , e.g. ,  [ ] ) are probably the only commercial applications of quantum information and quantum optics up to now@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although , various protocols of quantum money have already been proposed ( see , e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] ) , this interest can not be compared with the immense popularity and applicability of qkd ( see  refs .  [ ] as an example of recent and fundamental achievements ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is partially because there have not been , to our knowledge , any experimental realizations of quantum money performed yet . here </S>",
    "<S> , we report not only an experimental implementation of quantum money but also an experimental attempt to its forgery using optimal cloning machines .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental work basically describes one - by - one attacks on each single qubit . in the quantum money scheme , however , eavesdroppers , in principle , can access every qubit at once . </S>",
    "<S> so , they can globally access multiple qubits and can seek superior attacks using such global access . </S>",
    "<S> this could be a reason why there has not been a known representative work for the experiment of attacking quantum money , because this would need to treat numerous qubits and difficult global controls of their quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the attacks presented in this work are less distinguished from quantum cloning itself or the attack for bb84 quantum key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , collective or coherent attacks on multiple qubits simultaneously can , in principle , optimize the attacker s strategy . </S>",
    "<S> this is , nevertheless , considerably more demanding if not impossible with the current state of experimental quantum information processing . in this paper , we investigate a more accessible form of attack based on individual cloning which , in our view , represents a realistic threat for near - future quantum communications , including quantum money schemes .    </S>",
    "<S> any information can be encoded as a sequence of zeros and ones . </S>",
    "<S> this sequence can also be represented using a set of single photons prepared in the horizontal and vertical polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization states of a photon can be described as a superposition of the two orthogonal polarization states , i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the spherical coordinates of this qubit on the bloch sphere , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote horizontal and vertical polarisations , respectively . for each such state </S>",
    "<S> there exists an orthogonal state @xmath4 and @xmath1 ) , there is no way of telling ( with certainty ) what logical value is associated with the photon .    </S>",
    "<S> any attempt of gaining this information from the photon will disturb its polarization state and damage the information . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using photons to transmit sensitive information appears to be a promising idea . in the simplest scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of polarized photons is associated with a set of numbers indicating the correct measurement bases . </S>",
    "<S> these latter sequence needs to be confidential . </S>",
    "<S> if this sequence would be intercepted together with the sequence of photons , the quantum information could be read and reproduced at will . </S>",
    "<S> first , by deterministically distinguishing between @xmath5 and @xmath6 associated with the bit values @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> next , by reproducing the detected state .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the advantages provided by this kind of quantum communication are limited to protocols , where a trusted arbiter checks the validity of a given sequence of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sequence of qubits can be used , e.g. , as one - time passwords ( tokens)@xcite or arbitrated quantum currency@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , some research has been conducted in order to eliminate the need for an arbiter in the quantum currency schemes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , tokens are widely applied as an extra layer of security , e.g. , in a two - step authentication protocols used in social media services or internet banking etc . </S>",
    "<S> while the classical tokens are sensitive to being copied , the quantum tokens can not be delivered to two or more users at the same time without disturbing a given quantum dataset @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is claimed today that the security of our data is as good as its passwords . in the following text </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to generate and check the security of the best tokens allowed by the laws of nature . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum passwords can not be copied nor viewed without damaging them . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum data are prone to noise and some level of noise has to be tolerated in order to harness the benefits of quantum technologies .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum tokens can also be used as quantum money . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of quantum money goes back to wiesner @xcite who proposed to embed a sequence of qubits into banknotes that would be verified by banks . </S>",
    "<S> this was the first idea of quantum cryptography introduced already in the early 1970s and eventually published in 1983@xcite .    in order to be able to verify the money , </S>",
    "<S> a bank would attach information about the banknote serial number as classical information . </S>",
    "<S> this pioneering idea evolved over the last decades to more practical protocols , which are shown to be more secure and less demanding on the participating parties of a quantum currency system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the protocols face the problem of decoherence that makes the quantum banknotes to be usable for a limited amount of time , even if the currency is represented as a sequence of photons @xcite , which can have exceptionally - long coherence times .    photons are robust to decoherence , because they do not usually interact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the string of photons is handled properly it can last in a coherent state long enough to be useful in some financial transactions . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a transaction , where quantum money is withdrawn at the speed of light from a bank by an authorized user as a sequence of photons that arrives at a payment terminal , which allows its user to redirect the money to any other payment terminal . </S>",
    "<S> the final user sends the sequence to the bank together with an account number , where the money is to be stored . </S>",
    "<S> lossless transmission of photons is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , banks would have to accept large enough parts of incomplete quantum banknotes and issue new ones . </S>",
    "<S> the same is done nowadays if a banknote is damaged or a small part of it is missing . </S>",
    "<S> the communication between the payment terminals can not be wiretapped without damaging this quantum money . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this quantum money scheme ( qms ) allows for some anonymity if the addresses of the terminals are not assigned to a specific person and there is at least one terminal used between the initial and final users . </S>",
    "<S> however , the money could be signed without damaging it using , e.g. , the approach discussed in .        </S>",
    "<S> perfect copying of quantum information is impossible @xcite , but as it was shown in various works , we can copy partially - known quantum information with very high fidelity . if we are going to clone some qubits more often than others , we can use a generic distribution function @xmath9 to describe this intent . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the value of @xmath10 , the more frequent cloning of the specific qubit is . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution function satisfies the following normalization condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the full solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath10 can be arbitrary , but until now only highly - symmetric distributions have been analysed ( see , e.g. ,   and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can be under the impression that this optimal cloning problem can be solved only for a highly - symmetric class of distributions </S>",
    "<S> . however , as we show below , we are in principle able to always find an optimal cloning machine corresponding to any randomly generated quantum tokens or banknotes . </S>",
    "<S> note that the most secure tokens are the ones with the highest entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies here , because the lowest average cloning fidelity , corresponding to the case most resistant to cloning attacks , is achieved for a uniform distribution @xmath10 , which has the highest possible entropy . </S>",
    "<S> however , while generating quantum money of a finite size at random , it is hard to ensure each time the perfect entropy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in practice , we could deal with any qubit distribution function @xmath10 that could be potentially known to the counterfeiter . in particular , there exist qubit distributions @xmath10 made of a weighted sum of two dirac s delta functions at any antipodes of the bloch sphere . in this special case </S>",
    "<S> , the problem is reduced to the classical case of standard digital tokens . </S>",
    "<S> this is because these particular functions tell us that there are only two states sent that could be discriminated deterministically . quantum money of this kind </S>",
    "<S> should obviously be avoided .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly review the main possible attack scenarios . without any knowledge about the token , the counterfeiter can use the universal quantum cloner @xcite . if the states , appearing in the qubit sequence , are known but their order is unknown , the attacker can apply a specialized optimal quantum cloning machine . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to the situation in which the attacker has some information about the money statistics , but does not know the sequence of qubits itself . </S>",
    "<S> the results of such an attack can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : token ] . unfortunately , </S>",
    "<S> if the attacker knows the sequence of bases , the quantum money ( tokens ) can be perfectly copied . </S>",
    "<S> +     contour plot showing how the probability of detecting a qubit of an unknown state @xmath14 for money verification depends on the imperfect choice of the measurement direction @xmath15 and the photon verification ( or discrimination ) resolution @xmath16 . specifically , this probability is equivalent to the fidelity @xmath17 for which the bloch vector is rotated with respect to its correct orientation by @xmath15 for a given value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the probability does not depend on @xmath18 or @xmath1 , but only on @xmath15 , which measures the angle between the original and rotated bloch vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black lines mark two specific values of @xmath16 : @xmath19 describes the minimal resolution needed to detect an attack with an optimal universal cloning machine and @xmath20 corresponds to the resolution reached in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> note that the shape of the depicted relation depends on the dispersion function of the detector . here , this function is chosen as the von mises  fisher distribution.,width=302 ]    * noise tolerance versus security . </S>",
    "<S> * let us estimate the level of noise tolerance needed for a quantum token to be validated in realistic conditions and compare it to the level of noise introduced by a given optimal quantum cloning . </S>",
    "<S> by doing so , we will limit the class of distributions associated with acceptable tokens . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that a counterfeiter can replace the noisy communication channel with a less noisy one and perform a quantum man - in - the - middle attack with an optimal quantum cloning machine . </S>",
    "<S> an equivalent assumption is that the counterfeiter is a party in the qms . </S>",
    "<S> finding the optimal cloning transformation for a given @xmath10 is a semi - definite programming problem@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such problem can be described as a task of finding a semi - definite operator @xmath21 ( a cloning map ) describing the copying process that maximizes the average single - copy fidelity @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> such operator is isomorphic to a completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average single - copy fidelity for an arbitrary distribution ( for symmetric @xmath23 cloning ) can be expressed @xcite as @xmath24 where the fidelities of copying a particular qubit for the first and second clones are @xmath25\\,\\textrm{and}\\ , f_{1}=\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(\\hat{\\rho}^{\\mathrm{t}}\\otimes\\hat{\\openone}\\otimes\\hat{\\rho})\\hat{\\chi}\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 stands for transposition , and @xmath28 is the single - qubit identity operator . </S>",

    "<S> the average single - copy fidelity written in a compact form reads @xmath32 in order to find the optimal cloning map @xmath21 , one needs to compute the @xmath33 operator defined as @xmath34 remarkably , we show in the methods that this operator depends only on its five expansion coefficients of @xmath10 in the basis of spherical harmonics , regardless of the exact form of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal map @xmath21 is found by maximizing @xmath22 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fopt ] ) for a given @xmath33 with the optimization algorithm described in  [ ] ( see also refs .  [ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the output distribution @xmath35 of the cloned qubits will differ from @xmath10 , because perfect cloning is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> each cloning machine prepares a perfect clone ( [ eq : psi ] ) , with probability equal to the fidelity @xmath36 , and an orthogonal state ( [ eq : ortpsi ] ) , with probability @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the distribution @xmath38 of the cloned qubit states can be expressed as @xmath39g(\\theta+\\pi,\\phi+\\pi).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is no difference between @xmath10 and @xmath35 , if the function is symmetric with respect to inverting the directions of the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the scenarios both for the best case ( a uniform qubit distribution ) and the worst case ( a sequence of distinguishable states ) . </S>",
    "<S> the class of such distributions defines the so - called mirror phase - covariant cloner ( or cloning ) ( mpcc)@xcite . note that the mpcc is a generalization of the phase - covariant cloners ( pccs ) , which enable optimal copying of a qubit state from the equator of the bloch sphere@xcite or other states on the bloch sphere with a definite angle @xmath18@xcite ( see the supplementary material@xcite for more details about the mpcc and pcc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the output distribution can not be used directly to quantify the quality of the clones , because it does not carry the information about the order of states in a given sequence .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysed sequence would usually contain some additional noise due to small random polarization rotations caused by various imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> these include state preparation , distribution , storage , and finally delivery and analysis . in practice , all these imperfections lead to the average sequence fidelity @xmath40 with respect to the ideally - performed qubit preparation , storage , and detection steps .    for simplicity , we assume that all the enlisted protocol elements are perfect , except the final step of our state analysis . </S>",
    "<S> if this final step is the polarization analysis of single photons with standard detectors and a polarization beam splitter , we have @xmath41 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we model the joint dispersion of the transmission channel and the state verification with respect to the target polarization by the spherical dispersion model on a sphere given by the von  mises  fisher distribution @xcite ( i.e. , the gaussian distribution on a sphere ) @xmath42 which is the probability density function of any qubit prepared in a target state given by its bloch vector being rotated by an angle @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the level of concentration of the density function around the state vector @xmath5 is given by the parameter @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the density function is normalized with the modified bessel function @xmath44@xcite . from this model </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the probability of detecting a qubit described by the density matrix @xmath45 is equivalent to the average fidelity ( [ eq : fopt ] ) and is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , our direct calculations for @xmath48 lead to @xmath49/(4\\kappa\\sinh\\kappa),$ ] where @xmath50 is the modified bessel function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the qms to be feasible , we need to accept those sequences with fidelity @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath52 describes the minimum resolution required to reveal an attack using a cloner with a given value of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath54 can be derived numerically from the fixed value of @xmath53 corresponding to the fidelity of polarization analysis . for a single qubit </S>",
    "<S> , we can use the following security condition @xmath55 where now @xmath16 describes the dispersion of the channel used by the counterfeiter to deliver the copied sequence . </S>",
    "<S> if this condition is satisfied , the counterfeiter can not cheat the verification process . </S>",
    "<S> the verification process is performed on the full sequence of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , any verification process that allows for some implementation imperfections should depend on the average verification fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> for a long sequence of cloned qubits this average fidelity is @xmath56 whereas for the verification threshold reads as @xmath57 these values can be obtained by projecting the delivered quantum banknote on the associated sequence of bases . </S>",
    "<S> these can be approximated as the ratios of the number of the correctly projected states to the number of the conclusive state projections . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum banknote passes the verification process if @xmath58 these quantities ( used in this inequality ) depend implicitly on the choice of @xmath10 as the quality of the optimally - counterfeited state depends on @xmath10 , specifically on its five expansion coefficients in terms of spherical harmonics , i.e. , five real numbers that could be estimated by the counterfeiter after measuring some random parts of the banknote . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the following text , we assume that @xmath10 is publicly known . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate experimentally that this weakness could be exploited by a counterfeiter .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the situation where the security threshold is given by a theoretical value of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , which does not take into account the threat of the counterfeiter using the knowledge about @xmath10 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one would naively assume that the forgery can not lead to the fidelity @xmath61 exceeding @xmath62 , corresponding to the fidelity of the universal cloning machine @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would appear that using the security threshold of @xmath63 might be a good idea , as it makes the qms more robust against errors . </S>",
    "<S> this means that one could naively allow the resolution of the verification process @xmath52 to be as small as @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is obtained from @xmath64/(2\\kappa_0\\sinh\\kappa_0)=5/6 $ ] . to illustrate that this could be a problem , </S>",
    "<S> let us imagine that we verify qubits described by the bloch vectors rotated by an angle @xmath15 from the bloch vectors of the expected states . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kappa0 ] , we see that the measured fidelity @xmath65 would be seemingly above the security threshold even for @xmath66 , which means that the verification process would recognize a large volume of pure states as valid </S>",
    "<S> . however , it would not accept the states for which the bloch vectors are rotated by more that @xmath67 from the target bloch vectors . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , we are approaching the situation where any state prepared in a basis , which is unbiased with respect to the verification basis , would pass the verification process . </S>",
    "<S> the counterfeiter can guess the conjugate basis correctly with probability @xmath68 and choose the correct state in the matching basis with probability @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath70 of an arbitrary banknote prepared by the counterfeiter is accepted and the qms is broken . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , this is not exactly the case as @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this could be dangerous if the dispersion of the state verification would not be described with the von mises  fisher distribution , but with some similar function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the low resolution regime of @xmath72 the full characterization of the verification setup is required in order to exclude this classical attack .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection resolution @xmath73 of a given experimental setup should be as large as possible . </S>",

    "<S> * we demonstrated that using currently available technology we are able to both implement and crack the original qms of wiesner@xcite , given that ( i ) a sequence of qubits , representing the quantum banknote is not sampled uniformly over the bloch sphere , ( ii ) the banknote is considered valid if more than @xmath97 of the sequence is delivered and its average fidelity is above the fidelity of the universal cloner@xcite , i.e. , @xmath120 . from our results </S>",
    "<S> it follows that to make the wiesner qms secure against copying , one should apply a @xmath10-dependent verification threshold , which corresponds to the average single - copy fidelity of the relevant optimal quantum cloner . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a specialized optimal cloner for an arbitrary qubit distribution @xmath10 can easily be found by computing only its five parameters and subsequently applying the optimization procedure described in . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our results will stimulate further research on secure quantum communication and quantum technologies . </S>",

    "<S> we apply the spherical harmonics@xcite @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical harmonics for @xmath124 are simply related to these for @xmath125 , because @xmath126 the operator @xmath33 , in terms of the spherical harmonics @xmath127 , can be expressed as @xmath128 where @xmath129 the bar denotes complex conjugation , and @xmath130 it can be directly shown that @xmath131 hence , we do not need terms with @xmath132 . for a real - valued distribution @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath133 this property follows from the definition of the spherical harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the normalized @xmath10 distributions one computes @xmath134 only for @xmath135 and @xmath123 , which results in five integrals in total . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the symmetry of the distribution @xmath10 , some of the integrals vanish , which simplifies further calculations . </S>",

    "<S> the experimental setup is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> pairs of photons were generated in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion using a liio@xmath137 crystal pumped by 200mw of cw kr@xmath138 laser beam at 413 nm . </S>",
    "<S> hundreds of photon pairs were collected using single - mode fibres and transferred to the input of the cloner setup . </S>",
    "<S> one photon of each pair ( i.e. , a cloned photon ) was used to encode a bit of quantum information into its polarization state , while the other photon served as an ancilla being either horizontally or vertically polarized . in the next step , </S>",
    "<S> the cloned and ancillary photon interfere on a polarization - dependent beam splitter ( pdbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , this beam splitter should transmit the horizontally - polarized light with intensity transmissivity of 0.789 and the vertically - polarized light with intensity transmissivity of 0.211 . </S>",
    "<S> due to manufacturing errors , the real intensity transmissivities of our pdbs are 0.76 and 0.18 for horizontal and vertical polarisations , respectively . to correct for this deviation between the real and ideal pdbs parameters , a beam divider assembly ( bda ) is inserted into each output mode of the pdbs . </S>",
    "<S> this bda consists of two beam displacers separating and subsequently rejoining horizontal and vertical polarization components of photons wave packets . by inserting a neutral - density filter ( ndf ) into either a horizontal or vertical polarization mode inside the bda </S>",
    "<S> , one can achieve polarization sensitive losses and , thus , compensate for incorrect parameters of the pdbs . </S>",
    "<S> note that this compensation can restore an ideal operation of the pdbs at the expense of a lower success rate . to balance the rate of </S>",
    "<S> the cloned and ancillary photons , some additional ndfs can be placed behind the bdas . </S>",
    "<S> finally , both the cloned and ancillary photons are subjected to our polarization analysis consisting of a set of quarter - wave ( qwp ) and half - wave ( hwp ) plates followed by a polarizing prism@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coincident photon detections are counted for each combination of the polarization projection onto the horizontal , vertical , diagonal , anti - diagonal , and both circular polarisations . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrices of the corresponding two - photon states are then estimated using a maximum - likelihood algorithm@xcite . a more detailed account on the experimental procedure is available in our technical paper@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the swapping procedure used for the optimal classical copying strategy was implemented with the setup shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] by removing the pdbs and filters used in the bdas . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the following hybrid quantum - classical cloning procedure : initially , we prepared the best classical replacement for @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath140 in the ancillary mode and randomly swapped it with the input state @xmath141 for a fraction @xmath107 of the input photons . for the remaining @xmath142 photons we performed the relevant optimal quantum cloning . </S>",
    "<S> when properly tuned , this procedure is far less noisy than the implementation of pure quantum cloning and , thus , the quality ( described by , e.g. , the dispersion of the fidelity ) of this hybrid cloning procedure depends mostly on the quality of the quantum cloning process ( see figs .
