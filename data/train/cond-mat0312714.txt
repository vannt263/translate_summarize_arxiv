    "in a series of earlier communications @xcite we have proposed the augmented space recursion ( asr ) as an efficient computational technique for the calculation of configuration averaged electronic properties of random binary alloys .",
    "the method is a combination of the augmented space formalism @xcite and the recursion method of haydock @xcite .",
    "when coupled with the local density functional approximation based tight - binding linearized muffin - tin orbital @xcite it provides a first - principles determination of electronic structure and total energy calculations for disordered alloys .",
    "effects such as short - ranged ordering and local lattice distortions due to size mismatch of the constituent atoms can very easily be incorporated in the methodology @xcite . recently",
    "the method has been applied to study dispersion and line widths for phonons in disordered alloys . since recursion can take into account disorder in beyond nearest - neighbour force constants as well as large environmental effects , this application was a step forward in the theory of phonons in disordered alloys @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out repeatedly in the above publications that the asr with its terminator approximation @xcite goes beyond the standard single - site mean field theories and accurately takes off - diagonal disorder into account .",
    "a number of attempts have been made for practical implementation of mean - field theories beyond the single site approximation .",
    "one of the most sophisticated developments among the mean - field theories , is the travelling cluster approximation of gray and kaplan @xcite and its latest version : the itinerant coherent potential approximation ( icpa ) @xcite , where a small number of classes of selected excitations in augmented space are preserved . in spite of the simplification",
    "so introduced , the resulting equations are still formidable enough to discourage further generalization to larger clusters beyond the nearest neighbour . in the cluster cpa proposed by mookerjee @xcite , in which one retains disorder fluctuations only from a chosen cluster and replaces the rest of the system by an effective medium , one is restricted by the limitation of solving number of coupled self - consistent equations .",
    "the number of equations increases with the size of chosen cluster , which again discouraged extension to larger clusters beyond the nearest neighbour .",
    "this brings us back to the attempt at the implementation of the asr for large environment fluctuations , implying accurate evaluation of a large sequence of recursion coefficients .",
    "we shall discuss this in some detail in the following section .",
    "the asr , in its practical implementation to real alloy systems , has several practical problems",
    ". the formalism maps a disordered hamiltonian , described in a hilbert space spanned by a countable basis in which preferably its representation is sparse , onto an ordered hamiltonian in an enlarged space .",
    "this enlarged or _ augmented _ space is constructed by taking the outer product of the configuration space of the random variables of the disordered hamiltonian together with original hilbert space in which the disordered hamiltonian was described .",
    "the main difficulty in the implementation of recursion in this augmented space is its enormous rank .",
    "a system of @xmath1 sites with binary distribution has an augmented space of rank @xmath2 .",
    "this enormous rank of the augmented space and its description on the computer is what had discouraged earlier workers in implementing the asr , although the augmented space formalism was first proposed about thirty years ago @xcite .",
    "the second problem was the recursive propagation of errors .",
    "very small errors during recursion ( inevitable in numerical implementations ) tends to add up leading to loss of orthogonality in the recursion basis .",
    "this leads to appearance of ghost states .",
    "haydock and te @xcite has overcome this difficulty in proposing the _",
    "dynamical recursion_. we refer the reader to their paper for details .",
    "in this communication we shall describe the reduction of the effective rank of the augmented space on which the recursion is carried out , using the local point - group symmetries in both the hilbert space and the configuration space .",
    "such reduction is well known in various manipulations in reciprocal space for ordered systems .",
    "however , such a reduction has not been implemented in real space recursion , although it had been proposed by gallagher @xcite quite some time ago .",
    "it had been shown by gallagher that if we start recursion with a state belonging to an irreducible subspace of a hilbert space , subsequent recursion always stays within this subspace .",
    "this allows us significant reduction in rank of the required subspace and makes this method practically feasible .",
    "further , this method with its terminator approximation , retains the herglotz properties of the configuration averaged green function .",
    "the recursion method addresses inversions of infinite matrices @xcite .",
    "once a sparse representation of an operator in hilbert space , @xmath3 , is known in a countable basis , the recursion method obtains an alternative basis in which the operator becomes tri - diagonal .",
    "this basis and the representations of the operator in it are found recursively starting from @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where ,    @xmath6    for n@xmath7 2 . in this basis",
    "the representation of @xmath3 is tridiagonal :    @xmath8^{1/2}}\\ = \\ \\beta_n \\enskip ; \\enskip \\langle u_n\\vert \\tilde{h}\\vert u_{m}\\rangle \\ = \\   0 \\quad m\\geq n+2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the averaged green function can be written as a continued fraction :    @xmath9    the asymptotic part of the continued fraction is obtained from the initial set of coefficients @xmath10 for @xmath11 , using the idea of _ terminators _ @xcite . for small values of @xmath1",
    "we have large inaccuracies and the more the structure in the spectral density of @xmath3 the larger is the @xmath1 needed to maintain the window of accuracy required by us .      in earlier communications we have described how to deal with random binary alloys @xcite within the framework of the tight - binding linearized muffin - tin orbital method ( tb - lmto ) @xcite and using the augmented space formalism ( asf ) .",
    "we refer the readers to the seminal papers mentioned earlier for details . here",
    "we shall introduce only the salient features which will be required by us subsequently in this communication .",
    "we begin by setting up a muffin - tin potential with centres at the atomic sites @xmath12 on a lattice .",
    "next , we inflate the muffin - tins into atomic spheres and start from a most - localized tb - lmto representation of the hamiltonian  :    @xmath13    the _ potential parameters _ , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are diagonal matrices in the angular momentum indeces , and    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is a composite label @xmath18 for the angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "@xmath19 is the random site - occupation variable which takes values 0 or 1 with probability @xmath20 or @xmath21 @xmath22 respectively , depending upon whether the muffin - tin labelled by @xmath12 is occupied by @xmath23 or @xmath24-type of atom .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are projection and transfer operators in the hilbert space @xmath27 spanned by the tight - binding basis @xmath28 .",
    "we can associate the random variable @xmath19 with an operator @xmath29 whose eigenvalues correspond to the observed values of @xmath19 , and whose corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath30 are the _ state vectors _ of the variable .",
    "these state vectors of the set of @xmath1 random variables @xmath19 of rank @xmath31 span a space called configuration space @xmath32 with configurations of the kind @xmath33 where    @xmath34    if we define the configuration @xmath35 as the _ reference _ configuration , then any other configuration may be uniquely labelled by the _",
    "cardinality sequence _ : @xmath36 , which is the sequence of positions where we have a @xmath37 configuration .",
    "the _ cardinality sequence _ of the _ reference _ configuration is the null sequence @xmath38    the augmented space theorem states that    a(\\{n_r } )    where ,    @xmath39    ( @xmath40 ) is the spectral density of the self - adjoint operator @xmath29 , which is such that the probability density of @xmath19 is given by :    @xmath41    @xmath29 is an operator in the space of configurations @xmath42 of the variable @xmath19 .",
    "this is of rank 2 and is spanned by the _ states _ @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44    the expended hamiltonian @xmath45 in the augmented space is constructed by replacing all the random variables @xmath19 by the corresponding operators @xmath29 .",
    "it is an operator in the augmented space @xmath46 = @xmath47 .",
    "so the asf maps a disordered hamiltonian described in a hilbert space @xmath27 onto an ordered hamiltonian in an enlarged space @xmath46 , where the space @xmath46 is constructed by augmenting the configuration space @xmath48 of the random variables of the disordered hamiltonian together with the hilbert space @xmath27 of the disordered hamiltonian .",
    "the configuration space @xmath32 is of rank 2@xmath49 if there are n muffin - tin spheres in the system .",

    "the computational burden is considerably reduced due to this diagonal formulation , the recursion now becomes energy dependent as is clear from the form of the effective hamiltonian as shown in and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the recursion formalism of the ordered hamiltonian was free of this constraint .",
    "this energy dependence makes the recursion technique computationally unsuitable because to obtain the green functions we have to carry out recursion per energy point of interest .",
    "this problem has been tackled using _ seed recursion technique _ @xcite .",
    "the idea is to choose a few seed points across the energy spectrum uniformly , carry out recursion over those points and then interpolate the values of coefficients across the band . in this way",
    "one may reduce computation time .",
    "for example , if one is interested in an energy spectrum of 200 points , in the bare diagonal formulation recursion has to be carried out at all the 200 points but in the seed recursion technique one needs to perform recursions only at 10 - 15 points .",
    "the whole idea stems from the fact that in most of the cases of binary alloys , it is seen that the recursion coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 vary quite weakly across the energy spectrum . at this point",
    "we note that the above expression for the averaged @xmath61 is _ exact_.",
    "we mentioned earlier that recursion on the augmented space is not computationally feasible because of its large rank . for a binary alloy with @xmath1 sites and with only @xmath62-orbitals on them ,",
    "the rank of the augmented space is @xmath2 .",
    "implementing recursion on this huge space for a sufficient number of steps to ensure accuracy is often not feasible on available computers .",
    "however , if we exploit the symmetry both of the underlying lattice in real space and of the configuration space ( which arises due to the homogeneity of the disorder and arrangements of atoms on the underlying lattice ) , the rank of the irreducible part of the augmented space in which the recursion is effectively carried out becomes tractable .",
    "the conceptual advantages in asf include apart from analyticity , translational and underlying lattice symmetries automatically built into the augmented space hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to involve the idea of utilizing symmetry operations present in both the real and configuration spaces , in the context of recursion method , reducing the rank of hamiltonian drastically and making the implementation of asf feasible .",
    "since the augmented space recursion essentially retains all the properties of real space recursion but is described in a much enlarged space , it will be useful to consider symmetry operations in real space recursion first and then to consider those in the full augmented space .    during the recursion ,",
    "the basis member @xmath63 is generated from the starting state @xmath64 by repeated application of the hamiltonian .",
    "if the starting state belongs to an irreducible sub - space of the hilbert space then all subsequent states generated from recursion will belong to the same irreducible sub - space .",
    "physically , we may understand this as follows : the recursion states @xmath63 carry information of distant environment of the starting state .",
    "if the hamiltonian is nearest - neighbour _ only _ , then the state @xmath65 , which arises by the application of the hamiltonian on @xmath66 is a combination of states in the nearest shell with which @xmath64 couple via the hamiltonian .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 is a combination of n - th neighbour shell with which @xmath64 is coupled via the hamiltonian .",
    "if @xmath67 is a point group symmetry of the hamiltonian , then all @xmath68-th neighbour - shell states which are related to one another through the symmetry operator must have equal coupling to @xmath64 .",
    "hence , it is useful to consider among the @xmath68-th neighbour - shell states of which @xmath63 is a linear combination , only those belonging to the irreducible subspace and redefine the hamiltonian operation .",
    "= 3.0 in    as an example , take a nearest - neighbour @xmath62-state anderson model on a square lattice , with a binary distribution of its diagonal elements .",
    "we shall label the tight - binding basis by the position of the lattice points in units of the lattice constant : e.g. @xmath69 where @xmath70 are integers @xmath71 .",
    "the starting state @xmath72 belongs to the one dimensional representation of the point group of a square lattice .",
    "this state then couples with linear combinations of states on neighbour shells which are symmetric under square rotations  :    @xmath73    the shows the grouping together of sites with the local symmetry of the square lattice on the first three nearest neighbour shells of the central site .",
    "the first and second groups in are coloured gray in and the last group coloured black .",
    "the labels on the groups ( shown on the left sides of the equations ) are confined _ only _ to the upper right quadrant of the lattice .",
    "if we go up to @xmath1 shells ( for large @xmath1 ) there are about @xmath74 states in the diamond shaped nearest - neighbour cluster",
    ". however , there are only @xmath75 states with square symmetry .",
    "so within this reduction we can work only in 1/8-th of the lattice , provided we incorporate proper weights to the states to reproduce the correct matrix elements .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are two states coupled to each other via the hamiltonian , and both belong to the same irreducible subspace , and if @xmath78 are states obtained by operating on @xmath76 by the symmetry group operations of the real space lattice , then @xmath79 is called the _ weight _ associated with the state labelled by @xmath12 .",
    "if we wish to retain only the states in the irreducible subspace and throw out the others and yet obtain the same results , we have to redefine the hamiltonian matrix elements as follows  :    @xmath80    = 5.4 in    = 6.5 in = 6.in    in the above prescription , the new irreducible basis introduced by us , reflects only the symmetry of the underlying lattice and holds good for a model system which has @xmath62-like orbitals only . but for a real system , the tb - lmto minimal basis contains members with other symmetries as well .",
    "for example , in a cubic lattice with a @xmath81 minimal basis , we have basis members with @xmath62 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 symmetries .",
    "the symmetry of the orbitals is reflected in the two - centered slater - koster integrals and this prohibits overlap integrals at certain positions , called _ symmetric positions _ with respect to the overlapping orbitals .",
    "a few of these symmetric positions for a simple cubic lattice are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "for the sake of clarity we have shown only the projections on @xmath85 plane .",
    "we have indicated the positive and negative parts of the orbital lobes by different shades . from ( b )",
    "it is easy to argue that since the hamiltonian is spherically symmetric and the product @xmath86 is positive in the upper right quadrant and negative in the upper left quadrant : @xmath87 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath88 .",
