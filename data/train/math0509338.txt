    "when stability theory has been ported to contexts more general than first order logic , many situations have appeared when saturated models do not fulfill the main roles they play in elementary classes .",

    "dap is a known corollary of categoricity , even when ap is not assumed ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "approximations to theorem [ main theorem ] and its relatives were considered by several authors :    shelah in theorem 6.3 of @xcite gets uniqueness of limit models for classes with the amalgamation property under little more than categoricity in some @xmath148 together with existence of arbitrarily large models .",
    "the argument in @xcite depends in a crucial way on an analysis of ehrenfeucht - mostowski models ; however unlike @xcite since we do nt assume here categoricity and existence of models above the hanf number , our arguments do not require the ehrenfeucht - mostowski machinery .",

    "shelah in @xcite ( see claim 7.8 ) proved a special case of the uniqueness of limit models under the assumption of @xmath2-ap , categoricity in @xmath2 and in @xmath151 as well as assuming @xmath152 . in that paper shelah needs to produce _ reduced types _ and use some of their special properties .",
    "@xcite attempted to prove a uniqueness theorem without assuming any form of amalgamation ; however , they assumed that @xmath0 is categorical in some @xmath153 and that every model in @xmath0 has a proper extension .",
    "vandieren in @xcite managed to prove the above uniqueness statement under the assumptions of @xcite together with the additional assumption that @xmath154 is closed under unions of increasing @xmath8 chains .",
    "in @xcite the basic context is that of a _ good frame _ , which is an axiomatization of the notion of superstability .",
    "its full definition is more than a page long .",
    "shelah s assumptions on the aec include , among other things , the amalgamation property , the existence of a forking like dependence relation and of a family of types playing a role akin to that of regular types in first order superstable theories ",
    "shelah calls them _ bs_-types  and several requirements on the interaction of these types and the dependence relation .",
    "one of the axioms of a good frame is the existence of a non - maximal super - limit model .",

    "@xcite he states that in a good frame limit models are unique ( i.e. the same conclusion of our main theorem ) .",
    "( while we do nt claim that we understand shelah s proof or believe in its correctness , he explicitly uses the interplay between _ bs_-types and the forking notion as well as no long forking chains and continuity of forking . ) thus , the main differences are two : first , our assumptions on @xmath0 are weaker than what shelah is using ( and our use of various versions of superstability is different from that of @xcite , as we do not require the full power of good frames ) and second , our methods are quite different from his .",
    "the formal differences between our approaches can be summarized as follows :    \\(a ) suppose that @xmath0 is an aec satisfying the disjoint amalgamation property and is categorical in @xmath155 for some @xmath156 ; we then get uniqueness of limit models and no splitting chains of length @xmath157 .",
    "this result is used in @xcite to conclude that @xmath0 is categorical in all @xmath158 . in this case",
    "dap follows from the other assumptions . by way of comparison , in order to get a good frame , shelah needs results of @xcite ( a 99 pages - long paper ) and @xcite ( 220 pages ) to conclude that good frames exist from the assumption of categoricity in several consecutive cardinals @xmath159 several weak - diamonds .",
    "all our results are in zfc .",
    "\\(b ) if one takes @xmath0 to be the class of models of a complete first - order theory @xmath78 then what shelah is using in his uniqueness proof amounts to requiring ( the full power of assuming ) that @xmath78 is _ super_stable .",
    "however our uniqueness theorem just needs , in addition to the stability of @xmath78 , no splitting chains of length @xmath157 .",
    "as we do nt claim that our theorem is of great interest for first - order theories , the difference between this paper and claim 4.8 perhaps can be made clearer when one considers the bigger picture as in ( a ) above .",
    "the reason for these differences is that shelah s papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite focus on a problem entirely different from @xcite s .",
    "grossberg and vandieren s @xcite ( as well as @xcite ) were written with shelah s categoricity conjecture in mind .",
    "the basic assumption is categoricity in a cardinal above @xmath160 while shelah s above mentioned work goal , motivated by questions asked by grossberg in fall 1994 aimed to generalize @xcite to aecs which are not @xmath161 as the problems are quite different also the methods used to solve them are different , however occasionally the same concepts appear in both .",
    "we are particularly interested in theorem [ main theorem ] not only for the sake of generalizing shelah s result from @xcite but due to the fact that the first and second author use this uniqueness theorem in a crucial step to prove :    suppose that @xmath0 has arbitrarily large models , is @xmath162-tame and satisfies the amalgamation and joint embedding properties .",
