    "see _ e.g. _  @xcite . by restricting the standard model particles on the brane ,",
    "brane world models have evaded the strong constraints on the size of extra dimensions . up till now",
    "newtonion gravity is only tested to submillimeter scale @xcite , and existence of extra dimensions below this scale remains possible . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", extra dimensions open a new door to address the hierarchy problem , the large scale discrepancy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "for example , in the randall - sundrum two - brane model @xcite , one can obtain a large scale discrepancy by fine - tuning the interbrane distance , the radion ; thus some mechanisms have to be invoked to stabilize the radion @xcite .",
    "there are many moduli fields in string theory and the radion is an example .",
    "the moduli fields have to be stabilized so as not to upset the limits from long range force experiments and tests of general relativity .",
    "other than invoking stabilization potentials , there could also be some attractor mechanism that drives the theory towards general relativity @xcite .",
    "the radion may also act as a chameleon field and acquire mass by self - interactions to avoid the most restrictive of current bounds @xcite . if these scenarios hold , it is possible that the radion still evolves after the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "studies of brane world models can be divided into two main streams . on one hand ,",
    "more complex models are studied in order to strengthen the connection between string theories and brane models ; on the other hand , efforts are made to confront brane models with observational data @xcite . in the brane world scenario ,",
    "evolving radion induces variation of higgs vev , and therefore constraining the evolution of the radion implies limiting the evolution of higgs vev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the constraints on the evolution of the radion are obtained from bbn and the best fit to the observational abundances of d , @xmath5he and @xmath6li suggests a small variation in the radion during bbn compared to its present value .",
    "molecular spectral lines can be used to determine @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , reinhold _ et al .",
    "_ used quasar h@xmath8 spectral lines to obtain @xmath9 for a weighted fit @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath10 can be interpreted as an indication that the higgs vev ( and hence the radion ) at redshift 23 , was different from its value today .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are measured with high precision by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and other observations .",
    "thus it is timely to study the effects of the existence of extra dimensions on cmb and fill the `` redshift gap '' between bbn and quasar constraints using data from cmb . in this article",
    "we shall use the three - year wmap data to constrain the evolution of the radion .    within the brane world scenario , an extra term , called the dark radiation term , appears in the modified friedmann equations @xcite , and it causes great difficulty in calculating the sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in this work we will constrain the radion evolution through the variation of constants caused by the variation of higgs vev ignoring the dark radiation term .",
    "cmb has been used to constrain the higgs vev using the pre - wmap data in @xcite .",
    "however it is desirable to get an improved bound using the high precision three - year wmap data , including the polarization power spectrum .",
    "we also demonstrate that the constraints can be tightened substantially if we make use of hst measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "this rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : dr ] , we carry out the conventional dimensional reduction to get the radion dependence of various constants .",
    "we shall see that only the higgs vev is expected to vary in the context of brane world models .",
    "we then describe the effect of variation of higgs vev on the cmb power spectra in section  [ sec : effectcmb ] .",
    "the numerical constraints on the radion ( or higgs vev ) are presented in section  [ sec : nconstraint ] .",
    "we summarize in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we will start from the higher dimensional action and carry out the dimensional reduction to derive the dependence of the constants on the radion .",
    "there are many works on effective actions in extra dimensions , _",
    "@xcite , and the formalism here follows closely that in ref .",
    "we shall dimensionally reduce the higher dimensional gravitational action to obtain its low energy effective action first .",
    "the higher dimensional action reads @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the number of compact extra dimensions , and @xmath13 represents the bulk spacetime coordinate , @xmath14 .",
    "the higher dimensional ricci scalar is denoted by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the determinant of the full spacetime metric @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the matter field lagrangian density , which may include scalar fields , vector boson fields and dirac fermion fields .    to proceed",
    "we shall take the metric ansatz @xmath19 in this metric the greek indices run over 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 , while the latin indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 run over the extra dimensions from 4 to @xmath22 .",
    "we are only interested in the zero - mode of the kaluza klein expansion , and so the extra dimensional metric @xmath23 does not depend on the extra dimension coordinate .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the metric in eq .",
    "[ eqmetric ] is block - diagonal because the vector - like conection @xmath24 vanishes for zero - mode @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions are compactified on an orbifold and the dimensionless coordinate @xmath25 assumes values in the interval [ 0,1 ] . expressing @xmath15 in the terms of the 4d ricci scalar @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 can be written as @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the volume of the extra dimensions today .",
    "we shall work in the einstein frame with pure ricci scalar in the gravitational action .",
    "to do so we will apply the conformal transformation @xmath31 with @xmath32 for concreteness , we further assume that the extra dimensional manifold is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "hence the extra dimension metric takes the simple form : @xmath33 after the transformation eq .  [ eq : conformal ] and using the ansatz eq .  [ eq : edmetric ] , the action @xmath27 reduces to @xmath34 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to make the scalar field canonical , we define a new scalar field , the radion @xmath35 , as@xmath36 finally the effective action reads @xmath37.\\ ] ]    we now study the matter sector in more details .",
    "although the matter fields only live on the brane , their actions are still affected by the existence of extra dimensions because of the conformal transformation eq .",
    "[ eq : conformal ] .",
    "let us begin with the minimally coupled scalar field @xmath38 after the transformation eq .",
    "[ eq : conformal ] , we have @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath40 to make the kinetic term canonical .",
    "if @xmath41 is taken to be a simple renormalizable potential of the form @xmath42 we then have @xmath43 we see that the mass of the scalar field is dependent on the radion in the einstein frame for both signs of @xmath44 .",
    "one of the most important scalar fields in particle physics is the higgs field .",
    "masses of the fermions and quarks can be generated by their yukawa couplings to the higgs field . in this mechanism , the fermion masses are proportional to the higgs vev , @xmath0 .",
    "thus we get the radion dependence of the fermion mass @xmath45    for the gauge field , the action is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gauge - invariant field strength tensor .",
    "however the action is invariant under the conformal transformation eq .",
    "[ eq : conformal ] , and so the effective 4d coupling constant is the same as the higher dimensional @xmath48 .",
    "similar techniques can be applied to the dirac field @xmath49 with mass @xmath50 @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the vierbein and @xmath53 is the covariant derivative .",
    "applying eq .",
    "[ eq : conformal ] and redefining the field @xmath49 as @xmath54 we get the canonical action @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can read out the radion dependence of the fermion mass , which is the same as eq .",
    "[ eq : higgsmass ] .",
    "thus , for the brane world models in the einstein frame , only the fermion masses , among other fundamental constants , acquire radion dependence and are expected to vary . or , in the framework of standard model , we may say that only @xmath0 is radion - dependent while the yukawa coupling is constant .",
    "in the last section , we see that only @xmath0 is expected to vary in the brane world scenario . here",
    "we first discuss the effects of variation of @xmath0 on the cmb power spectra , and then we present the numerical constraints on @xmath0 and the radion using the the three - year wmap data .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 induces changes in the fermi constant @xmath56 , the quark masses , the nucleon binding energy and the electron mass @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath56 is not relevant in the epoch of cmb recombination .",
    "we can also ignore the changes in strong nuclear force and nuclear binding energy caused by the variation of quark mass . since the baryon mass is dominated by the qcd scale parameter @xmath57 , and",
    "the quark masses contribute at only a few percents level , we shall neglect the influence of @xmath0 on the baryon mass .",
    "thus the variation in @xmath0 boils down to variation of @xmath1 @xcite , which modifies the recombination history .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 enters cmb through the binding energies of hydrogen , h@xmath58 , and helium , he@xmath59 , thomson cross - section @xmath60 , and the recombination coefficients @xmath61 and the two - photon decay rates of hydrogen and helium . in the appendix",
    ", we list the evolution equations and modifications to take care of variations of @xmath1 . here",
    "we only sketch the modifications to be made .",
    "the binding energies scale as @xmath1 , @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath62 , and the two - photon decay rates vary as @xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath61 , one can derive a differential equation relating the matter temperature @xmath63 and @xmath1 @xcite , through which the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath1 can be deduced using the empirical fitting of @xmath61 as a function of @xmath63 in the literature .    among these effects caused by the variation of @xmath1 ,",
    "the change in the binding energy of hydrogen is most significant on the power spectra ; less important is the effect of thomson cross - section , while the effects of the recombination coefficients and two - photon rates are small .    for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the higgs vev in the era of cmb recombination and today respectively .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttspectrum ] is the cmb temperature power spectrum with @xmath4 being 1 , 1.05 and 0.95 respectively with the other parameters being the standard ones .",
    "= 1 , 1.05 and 0.95 respectively .",
    "other cosmological parameters assume the standard values . ]",
    "we see that both the positions and amplitudes of the peaks change for @xmath67 and 0.95 in comparison with @xmath68 . for @xmath67 ( 0.95 ) , because the binding energy @xmath69 and it dictates the epoch of cmb recombination , cmb recombination takes place at an earlier ( later ) time .",
    "therefore the sound horizon is smaller ( larger ) , and the distance to the last scattering surface is larger ( smaller ) ; the peaks shift to the larger ( smaller ) @xmath70 scales .",
    "the change in amplitudes is due to early integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe ( isw ) effect and damping effect . for @xmath67 ( 0.95 ) ,",
    "the residual radiation is higher ( lower ) right after recombination , which gives an enhanced ( reduced ) early isw effect and hence the first peak is boosted ( diminished ) .",
    "early recombination also means greater hubble rate and narrower visibility function at decoupling time , and thus the damping is reduced and the power in high @xmath70 scales is enhanced .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eespectrum ] is the @xmath71-polarization power spectrum with @xmath4=1 , 1.05 and 0.95 respectively .",
    "the main features of this power spectrum can be understood with the tight coupling semi - analytic formula for the polarization strength @xmath72 of a particular @xmath73 mode @xcite : @xmath74 ^ 2 } j_{l}(k ( \\eta_{0 } - \\eta _ { * } ) ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the conformal times of today and the last - scattering surface respectively .",
    "@xmath77 is the dipole of the photon distribution .",
    "again , for larger @xmath1 , recombination occurs at an earlier conformal time , and because the spherical bessel function peaks at @xmath78 , the peaks shift to the larger @xmath70s .",
    "the power of the peaks is higher because the dipole , which is like the velocity of a fluid in the tight coupling limit , is larger at the earlier time .    -polarization power spectrum with @xmath4=1 , 1.05 and 0.95 respectively . ]    in the above discussions , we have assumed that @xmath1 is constant in the whole calculation . because the effect of @xmath1 on cmb is only important near the decoupling time , even if we assume that @xmath1 evolves , _",
    "e.g. _ as a linear function of the scale factor @xmath79 , only the value of @xmath1 at the decoupling time matters .",
    "thus cmb indeed gives the constraint on @xmath1 at @xmath80 .      in this section ,",
    "we constrain the range of @xmath81 ( or radion ) using the three - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "to do so , we make use of the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method implemented by the engine cosmomc @xcite , which searches for the maximum of the likelihood function .",
    "the theoretical cmb spectra are calculated by the boltzmann code cmbfast @xcite .",
    "we vary the following set of parameters : the hubble parameter , @xmath82 , the baryon density , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , the cold dark matter density , @xmath85 , the reionization redshift , @xmath86 , the primordial fluctuation amplitude , @xmath87 , the spectral index , @xmath88 , and @xmath4 .",

    "the hubble parameter is allowed to vary in the range from 40 to 100 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ( we will suppress this unit afterwards ) . here and thereafter , the maxima of the distributions are arbitrarily normalized to 1 . ]    in particular , the 95% confidence interval ( c.  i. ) for @xmath4 is @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the constraint is relatively weak .",
    "most of the other standard cosmological parameters are well constrained in the usual ranges , except the hubble parameter .",
    "although the mean of @xmath2 being 67.6 is still close to the `` canonical '' value 72 , its distribution spreads wide .",
    "this suggests that @xmath2 may be degenerate with @xmath4 . to see the degeneracy between @xmath4 and other parameters explicitly , we display the contour marginal distributions of various cosmological parameters plotted versus @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : braneh_degen ] .    .",
    "among the free parameters , @xmath2 is the most strongly degenerate with @xmath4 . ]    among the parameters , @xmath94 and @xmath95 show slight degeneracy with @xmath4 , but @xmath4 is strongly degenerate with @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that we may obtain a tighter bound if we use the measurement of @xmath2 by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project to break the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "we carry out the mcmc run once again but with @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bounds on @xmath4 are tightened substantially , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the 95% c. i. now becomes [ 0.97 , 1.02 ] .    , but with @xmath2 fixed to be 72 .",

    "one sees again that the spread of the distribution of @xmath100 for @xmath2 being allowed to vary from 40 to 100 is much larger than that for fixed @xmath101 , and their 95% c. i. are [ -0.094 , 0.17 ] and [ -0.019 , 0.034 ] respectively .    the constraint on higgs vev by cmb is first deduced in @xcite using pre - wmap data sets .",
    "there is no marked difference between their constraint @xmath102 and ours with @xmath2 being allowed to vary in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "the small difference may be due to the use of different data sets and/or statistical methods .",
    "the data set we used is the recent three - year wmap data with the polarization spectrum @xcite while the pre - wmap temperature power spectrum is used in @xcite .",
    "they restricted @xmath2 in the interval [ 50 , 80 ] and more importantly @xmath104 in the interval [ 0.3 , 0.4 ] , which is a small portion of the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : radion_dis ] .",
    "we also allow for two more free parameters , @xmath105 and @xmath87 in our mcmc runs .",
    "that s why we get bounds comparable to theirs although we use more accurate data set .",
    "moreover , we show that the bounds on @xmath4 can be tightened substantially if the hst measurement of @xmath2 is used .",
    "since the upcoming planck satellite mission is going to measure the temperature power spectrum to as high as @xmath106 and the @xmath71-polarization spectrum to @xmath107 , we expect that there will be tremendous improvement in the constraint on @xmath4 .",
    "we can forecast the improvement that planck will bring quantitatively using the fisher matrix , which has been widely used to predict the expected uncertainties in future experiments ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . under the assumption of gaussian perturbations and gaussian noise",
    ", the fisher matrix takes the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath20th free parameter and @xmath110 is the @xmath70th multipole of the observed spectrum of type @xmath111 , which can be the temperature , temperature - polarization and e - polarization spectra .",
    "the experimental precision is encoded in the covariant matrix @xmath112 . with the expected planck power spectra",
    ", the constraint on @xmath4 is tightened by a factor of 7 when @xmath2 is allowed to vary ; the current constraint with @xmath2 fixed will be tightened by a factor of 5 .",
    "we compare the present cmb constraints with other constraints in table [ tab : me_constraint_table ] .",
    "we note that the bbn constraint and the quasar absorption line constraint are of opposite signs . even if both constraints are found to be correct , that does not immediately rule out the evolution of the radion since the radion may stabilize to its present value in an oscillatory manner .",
    "if this is the case , we may find that the radion takes a value very close to 1 near the epoch of cmb recombination .",
    "unfortunately , the current cmb data is not discriminating enough . with the forthcoming planck data ,",
