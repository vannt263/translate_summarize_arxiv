    "spin - polarized hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , and its isotopes spin - polarized deuterium ( d@xmath0 ) and tritium ( t@xmath0 ) , are fully quantum systems with a wealth of interesting properties .",
    "the low mass of h@xmath0 and the very weak attractive part of its interaction potential makes possible that it remains in a stable gas phase even in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "recent microscopic calculations at zero temperature have shown that the gas phase persists for pressures up to 170 bar .",
    "@xcite the gaseous state of bulk h@xmath0 was proposed in 1976 by stwalley and nosanow  @xcite as the best reliable option to achieve a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state without the strong depletion of the condensate that correlations induce in superfluid @xmath3he .",
    "after 22 years of intense and continued experimental work by many groups , fried _",

    "@xcite managed to achieve a bec of h@xmath0 .",
    "problems that needed to be overcome included recombination on the walls , by working with a wall - free confinement , and low evaporation rates by using spin resonance . in the meantime ,",

    "et al._.  @xcite the s - wave scattering length @xmath6 is appreciably smaller than the typical values for alkalis , which retards evaporative cooling and produces a higher transition temperature ( 50 @xmath7 ) .",
    "essentially the same interaction can be applied for heavier isotopes spin - polarized deuterium d@xmath0 and tritium t@xmath0 .",
    "d@xmath0 atoms obey fermi statistics , and so the zero - pressure state of bulk d@xmath0 depends on the number of occupied nuclear spin states .",
    "in the limit of zero pressure and zero temperature , previous theoretical studies  @xcite have shown that ( d@xmath8 ) with only one occupied nuclear spin state is a gas , while bulk d@xmath0 with two ( d@xmath9 ) and three ( d@xmath10 ) equally occupied nuclear spin states remains liquid .",
    "spin - polarized tritium , which obeys bose statistics , is expected to be liquid  @xcite due to its larger mass .",

    "a comparison between different potentials employed in the past is reported in ref . .",
    "we have also verified that the addition of mass - dependent adiabatic corrections ( as calculated by kolos and rychlewski  @xcite ) to the jdw potential does not change the energy of the bulk spin - polarized tritium .",

    "an important information that can be derived from the dmc simulations of the liquid and solid phases is the location of the liquid - solid phase transition point . as in a recent investigation of the gas - solid phase transition in h@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", we have used the double - tangent maxwell construction to determine the transition .",
    "this well - known method is based on the search of a common tangent to both the liquid and solid equations of state whose intersections give the freezing ( @xmath72 ) and melting ( @xmath73 ) densities , as plotted in fig . [",

    "the three transition pressures fall within the errorbars , but since hcp is consistently lower than the others it leads us to conclude that it may be slightly preferred , like it is preferred in @xmath3he .",
    "the transition densities in @xmath3he are @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,  @xcite corresponding to a pressure of 25.3 bar",
    ". the comparison can also be made with with gas - solid transition in spin - polarized h@xmath0  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the phase transition occurs at higher densities @xmath83 @xmath34 , @xmath84 @xmath34 and much higher pressure , @xmath85 bar , than in spin - polarized t. this effect can be explained as a consequence of its isotopic difference since t@xmath0 atoms have approximately three times greater mass than h@xmath0 atoms .     as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "the densities at which the first - order transition occurs are identified by finding the common tangent ( solid line ) to both the solid ( dotted line ) and liquid curve ( dot - dashed line ) . ]    as in any first - order phase transition , the density is discontinuous in the transition point .",
    "another quantity which is also not continuous crossing the phase transition is the kinetic energy per particle .",
    "namely , near the freezing density the kinetic energy per particle of the liquid is @xmath87 k , while at the same time , near the melting density but in the solid phase the same energy is @xmath88 k. therefore , our results for bulk t@xmath0 show a discontinuity of the kinetic energy of around 3.5 k ; in bulk h@xmath0 , the same difference has been shown to be more than twice times larger.@xcite on the other hand , the value of the condensate fraction in the two spin - polarized systems at the corresponding transition densities are similar , 0.03 for t@xmath0 and 0.04 for h@xmath0  @xcite .     and the dashed line to the solid at @xmath73 . ]    a measure of the mean displacement of t@xmath0 atoms with respect to the lattice sites is obtained by computing the lindemann s ratio ( @xmath89 ) . as usual , we calculate it by sampling the expression @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the lattice constant",
    ". the parameter @xmath89 decreases monotonically with increasing density and the values we have obtained show a slight dependence on the particular lattice chosen for the simulation : it is greatest for hcp and smallest for bcc .",
    "particularly , at the melting density of the hcp phase lindemann s ratio assumes a value @xmath92 , which is the same as in @xmath3he and similar to the value estimated for solid h@xmath0 ( @xmath93 )  @xcite .",
    "the discontinuity in the liquid - solid transition is also revealed in the difference between @xmath70 of the liquid and solid phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grtrans ] ) .",
    "even more dramatic difference between the two phases is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sktrans ] where dmc results of @xmath94 are shown at @xmath95 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath94 in the solid phase is characterized with strong peaks at reciprocal lattice sites whereas this behavior is clearly not observed in the @xmath94 of the liquid phase .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the main peak of solid @xmath94 is slightly weaker in t@xmath0 than in h@xmath0 ( reported in ref . ) .",
    "the main reason for this lies in the fact that the liquid - solid transition in t@xmath0 emerges at lower densities than gas - solid transition in h@xmath0 .     and",
    "to the solid at @xmath73 . ]",
    "the ground - state properties of spin - polarized tritium t@xmath0 have been accurately determined using the dmc method in both the liquid and solid phases .",
    "the obtained results are based on the precise knowledge of the t@xmath0-t@xmath0 interatomic potential , which combined with the accuracy of the dmc method , allowed for a nearly exact determination of the main properties of the system .",
    "all the previous results on liquid t@xmath0 were based on a morse potential and approximate computational methods .",
    "hence , our predictions for equilibrium density and energy per particle differ substantially from those .",
    "we find that the equilibrium density is @xmath96 @xmath34 , which expressed in units of @xmath76 is very similar to the one of liquid @xmath3he ( @xmath97 for t@xmath0 , @xmath98 in @xmath3he ) .",
    "previous predictions of the equilibrium density lie below our predicted spinodal density . despite a similar equilibrium density , t@xmath0 has approximately half the equilibrium energy per particle of liquid @xmath3he as a consequence of its smaller mass and shallower potential",
    ".    at a high enough density the system freezes .",
    "we have studied the energetic and structural properties of the solid phase for three lattices .",
    "differences in energies between the phases are almost indistinguishable , but hcp seems to be slightly preferred over the fcc and bcc ones . from the dmc equations of state of the liquid and solid phases , we have localized the liquid - solid transition point of t@xmath0 for the first time , to the best of our knowledge . at zero temperature ,",
