    "the precise location of the essential spectrum of the dirichlet laplacian is difficult , and the existence of eigenvalues is a highly non - trivial fact .",

    "section  [ sec.ess ] is devoted to the location of the essential spectrum under the hypotheses that the twisting and bending vanish at infinity of the tube .",
    "the effects of bending and twisting are studied in sections  [ sec.bending ] and  [ sec.twisting ] , respectively .",
    "more precisely , in section  [ sec.bending ] we show that bending gives rise to eigenvalues below the essential spectrum in non - twisted tubes , while in section  [ sec.twisting ] we deal with the hardy inequalities due to twisting in non - bent tubes . as an application of the hardy inequality , in section  [ sec.mild ]",
