    "one can easily notice that at times @xmath60 , maximally entangled states are obtained , while at times @xmath61 , the entanglement vanishes ; these special times can also be seen in figure  2 .",
    "the bath also induces decoherence that enters via ( [ eq : s3:decoherencefunction - rel ] ) .",
    "the result for the entanglement is that the decaying envelope function is superimposed onto the coherent dynamics described above .",
    "the magnitudes of the first and subsequent peaks of the concurrence are determined only by this function . as temperature increases",
    ", the envelope decays faster resulting in lower values of the concurrence , see the inset in figure  2 .",
    "note also that generation of entanglement is possible only provided that the initial state is a superposition of the eigenvectors of the induced interaction with more than one eigenvalue ( for pure initial states ) .",
    "for example , the initial state @xmath62 in our case would only lead to the destruction of entanglement , i.e. , monotonically decreasing concurrence , similar to the results in @xcite .    since @xmath13",
    ", there is no relaxation by energy transfer in the system , and the exponentials in ( [ eq : s3:adiabaticsolution ] ) , with ( [ eq : s3:decoherencefunction - rel ] ) , suppress only the off - diagonal matrix elements , i.e. , those with @xmath63 .",
    "it happens , however that at large times the @xmath64-dependence is not important in ( [ eq : s3:decoherencefunction - rel ] ) and @xmath65 vanishes for certain values of @xmath63 .",
    "in the basis of the qubit - bath interaction , @xmath66 , the limiting @xmath67 density matrix for our initial state ( @xmath45 ) is @xmath68 , which takes the form @xmath69 in the basis of states @xmath45 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . the significance of such results , see also @xcite , is that in the present model not all the off - diagonal matrix elements are suppressed by decoherence , even though the concurrence of this mixed state is zero .",
    "the probabilities for the qubits to occupy the states @xmath45 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are presented in figure  5 . for the initial state @xmath45 , only the diagonal and inverse - diagonal matrix elements are affected , and the system oscillates between the two states @xmath45 and @xmath72 , as mentioned earlier in the description of the coherent dynamics , while decoherence dampens these oscillations down .",
    "in addition , decoherence actually raises the other two diagonal elements to a certain level , see ( [ eq : rolimit ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the inverse - diagonal density matrix elements is shown in figure  6 .    , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the parameters are the same as in figure  1 .",

    "to summarize , we studied the initial stages of the cross - qubit interaction induced by a thermal bosonic bath .",
