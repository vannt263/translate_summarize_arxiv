    "the eclipse geometry is defined by the mass ratio @xmath36 , which sets the shape and the relative size of the roche lobes , and the inclination @xmath37 , which determines the shape and extension of the shadow of the secondary star projected onto the orbital plane .",
    "we adopted the values by @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this combination of parameters ensures that the white dwarf is at the center of the map .    before applying eclipse mapping techniques to a high inclination system such as dq  her , it is important to address the question whether the disk rim can hide parts of the accretion disk from view ( thereby leading to unreliable results ) . in particular ,",
    "a vertically - extended , thick disk rim could lead to an important self - obscuration effect on the disk side closest to the observer if the disk half - opening angle is @xmath40 .",
    "an estimate of the disk half - opening angle in dq  her comes from the recent work of @xcite .",
    "they applied eclipse mapping techniques to trace the changes in surface brightness distribution along the 71@xmath28 pulsation cycle and found that a vertically - extended bright spot at disk rim is the main site of emission of the @xmath9 optical oscillations .",
    "the upper side of the bright spot is illuminated by one of the magnetic poles once per cycle , while the lower side of the bright spot is illuminated by the other pole roughly half a cycle later . from the difference in the projected position of the upper and lower bright spot sides in their eclipse maps",

    "combined with a bright spot radial distance of @xmath42 ( see section  [ structures ] ) , this leads to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the lowest range of values for @xmath6 is hard to be interpreted by the steady - state disks model , where flared disks are expected , with the vertical tickness @xmath45 proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath46 and increasing with radius with by factor @xmath47 .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath6 decreases with increasing inclination , and the inequality @xmath48 holds for any reasonable inclination ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "hence , self - obscuration by the disk rim is not an issue in dq  her .",
    "the fact that the bright illumination pattern that rotates with the @xmath9 pulsation period in the inner disk regions remains visible when it is passing in the disk side near the observer @xcite yields additional support for the above statement .",
    "we are therefore confident that no distortion effects caused by self - obscuration by the disk rim arise when applying eclipse mapping techniques to the dq  her light curves .    for the reconstructions we used the default of limited azimuthal smearing of @xcite , which is better suited for recovering asymmetric structures than the original default of full azimuthal smearing ( c.f .",
    "simulations showing the ability of the eclipse mapping method to reconstruct asymmetric brightness distributions ( even under unfavorable conditions of low s / n and incomplete phase coverage ) are presented and discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used a radial blur width @xmath50 and an azimuthal blur width @xmath51 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the eclipse maps were estimated with a monte carlo procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for each narrow band light curve , a set of 20 artificial light curves was generated in which the data points were independently and randomly varied according to a gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the uncertainty at that point .",
    "the light curves were fitted with the eclipse - mapping code to produce a set of randomized eclipse maps .",
    "these were combined to produce an average map and a map of the residuals with respect to the average , which yields the statistical uncertainty at each pixel .",
    "the uncertainties obtained with this procedure were used to estimate the errors in the derived radial intensity and temperature distributions as well as in the spatially resolved spectra .",
    "we also divided each eclipse map by the map of the residuals with respect to the average to produce maps of the inverse of the relative errors , or signal - to - noise ratio maps @xcite .",

    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ heii_curves ] shows velocity - resolved eclipse maps for the heii 4686 line .",
    "the velocity - resolved h@xmath6 ( and , to a less extent , the heii 4686 line ) light curves show the expected behavior for the eclipse of gas rotating in the prograde sense ( rotational disturbance ) , with the blue side being eclipsed earlier than the red side .",
    "the eclipse maps in symmetric velocity bins do not show the reflection symmetry around the line joining both stars expected for the emission from a symmetric disk around the white dwarf .",
    "the clear egress shoulder in the light curves reveals an azimuthally - extended asymmetry in the outer parts of the disk extending @xmath54 ahead of the intersection of the stream trajectory with the disk rim .",
    "this azimuthally - extended bright spot indicates that the shock of the inflowing gas with the outer disk is radiatively inefficient , with the emission pattern spreading along the direction of gas rotation .",
    "moreover , if the bright spot can not cool efficiently it should also expand in the vertical direction , leading to a vertically - extended bulge in the outer disk that becomes a natural site for reprocessing of x - ray radiation from the rotating magnetic poles  in line with the findings of @xcite . from the radial position of the maximum intensity of the bright spot , we estimate an outer disk radius of r@xmath55 .    in order to emphasize the structures observed in the line maps , we calculated net line emission maps .",
    "these were obtained by combining continuum eclipse maps on the short and long wavelength sides of the target emission line and by subtracting the derived average continuum map from each of the velocity resolved line maps .",
    "because of our choice to display the maps in a logarithmic grayscale ( that only handles positive intensities ) , regions where the resulting intensities are negative ( indicating line absorption ) were suppressed from the net line emission maps shown in figs .  [ hbet_curves ] and [ heii_curves ] .",
    "the balmer lines net emission maps show a dearth of emission at the bright spot position , indicating that these lines are in absorption at the infalling stream impact site ( see section  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the heii 4686 line appears clearly in emission at the bright spot position ( fig .",
    "[ heii_curves ] , right - hand panels ) .",
    "the emission is stronger in the positive velocity maps but weak blueshifted emission is also seen in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 velocity maps .",
    "the latter is likely the result of gas splashing away from the accretion disk ( with a velocity component towards the observer ) after the collision of the infalling gas stream with the disk rim .",
    "the redshifted emission reflects the fact that disk gas at the bright spot position is mostly moving towards the far side of the disk and , therefore , away from the observer .    because the temperatures in the outer disk regions ( @xmath58 , see section  [ temperatures ] )",
    "are not enough to power the high - excitation heii 4686 line , the strong heii emission from this region is an indication that the bright spot must be an important source of reprocessing of x - ray radiation from the magnetic poles / curtains  again in line with the findings of @xcite . this is consistent with and leads to a natural explanation for the results of @xcite  who found that the amplitude of the @xmath9 pulsations is variable along the orbit and reaches maximum around phase @xmath59  and of @xcite  who correctly advanced the conclusion that the orbital behavior of the @xmath9 pulsations amplitude requires that the x - ray reprocessing site be a disk rim with variable thickness and maximum visibility at phases @xmath60 .",
    "this coincides with the phase range where the upper side of the azimuthally- and vertically - extended bright spot is best seen .",
    "the zero - velocity h@xmath6 net line emission map shows a peculiar `` heart''-shaped distribution close to disk center ( @xmath61 ) with major axis aligned at an angle of @xmath62 with respect to the line joining both stars ( fig .  [ hbet_curves ] ) .",
    "morphologically similar structures are also seen in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 velocity maps , with the positive velocity maps showing the receding part of the structure ( i.e. , the upper hemisphere of the eclipse maps in figs .  [ hbet_curves ] and [ heii_curves ] ) and the negative velocity maps showing the leading part of the structure ( i.e. , the lower hemisphere of the eclipse maps in figs .  [ hbet_curves ]  and  [ heii_curves ] ) .",
    "an asymmetric structure resembling a dipole pattern and aligned at a similar orientation can be seen in the zero - velocity heii 4686 net emission map ( fig .  [ heii_curves ] ) .",
    "we will return to this point in section  [ curtains ] .",
    "motivated by the distinct emission observed at the bright spot and gas stream regions and in order to avoid contamination by bright spot emission that could affect the spectrum of the near side of the disk ( the hemisphere closest to the secondary star in the eclipse maps of figs .",
    "[ hbet_curves ]  and  [ heii_curves ] ) , we divided the eclipse maps in two distinct regions : `` disk '' and `` gas stream '' .",
    "we define the `` disk '' as the disk section between azimuths @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and `` gas stream '' as the region between azimuths @xmath67 and @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ disk_esq ] ) .",
    "we further defined annular sections of width @xmath68 to extract spatially - resolved spectra as a function of radius . in order to isolate the contribution of possible asymmetric brightness sources in the eclipse maps ( e.g. , the bright spot , gas stream or accretion curtains ) we separated the total emission into its symmetric and asymmetric disk emission components .",
    "the symmetric component is obtained by slicing the disk into a set of radial bins , computing the average of the lower half of the intensities in each bin , and fitting a smooth spline function to the resulting set .",
    "the spline fitted intensity in each annular section is taken as the symmetric component .",
    "the asymmetric component is obtained by subtracting the symmetric component from the original eclipse map .",
    "this procedure essentially preserves the baseline of the radial profile , removing all azimuthal structure from the symmetric component .",
    "the statistical uncertainties affecting the fitted intensities are estimated with a monte carlo procedure ( section  [ mem ] ) .",
    "[ spec_disk ] shows spatially resolved spectra for the symmetric disk component and for the  gas stream  region ( total emission ) . in the inner regions ( @xmath69 )",
    "the disk spectrum shows a flat and featureless continuum with no balmer or heii lines .",
    "the disk spectrum becomes progressively redder and fainter with increasing radius , indicating the existence of a radial temperature gradient .",
    "the balmer and heii lines start to appear in emission at intermediate disk regions ( @xmath70 ) and become stronger with increasing radii .",
    "the spectrum of the  gas stream  is systematically bluer and brighter than the disk spectrum at the same radius and the difference increases with radius .",
    "in contrast to the observer in the disk spectra , in the outer regions ( @xmath71 ) the lines appear in absorption , indicating that the emitting gas is optically thick .",
    "the p  cygni profile of the balmer lines in the `` gas stream '' spectrum framing the bright spot , at @xmath72 , is an indication that part of the colliding gas stream deflects back towards the observer , in agreement with the inference previously drawn from the heii @xmath1 net emission line maps .",
    "the lack of balmer lines in the innermost disk regions may be interpreted in a scenario of magnetically - controlled accretion for radii smaller than the alfvn radius .",
    "assuming for dq her a white dwarf mass of @xmath73 @xcite , an accretion rate of @xmath74 ( section  [ temperatures ] ) and a white dwarf magnetic moment in the range @xmath75 ( typical for intermediate polars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate an alfvn radius for dq her in the range @xmath76 . it is expected that inside this radius the disk will be disrupted , with the gas being channelled by the magnetic field lines onto accretion curtains down to the magnetic poles at the white dwarf surface .",
    "this produces magneto-_bremsstrahlung _ ( free - free ) radiation by the optically thin gas , which leads to a spectrum basically flat for the spectral range between the self - absorption limit and a thermal - cutoff .",
    "hence , the spectrum observed in the innermost disk regions ( i.e. , flat and featureless ) could plausibly be interpreted in this context @xcite .",
    "a relatively narrow ( fwhm @xmath77 ) and redshifted ( by @xmath78 ) caii @xmath4 absorption line can be seen both in the disk and in the gas stream spectra up to @xmath79 .",
    "( there are hints that a similarly narrow and redshifted caii @xmath80 absorption line is also present in the disk and gas stream spectra at the same radial range , although we assign a low weight to this statement as this line is heavily blended with the broad @xmath81 emission line . )",
    "this corresponds to the caii s - wave seen in absorption in the trailed spectrogram of the same data set and which @xcite associated to the accretion disk .",
    "could the caii line be the result of absorption of disk radiation by a cool and vertically - extended disk rim along the line of sight ?",
    "the evidences say no .",
    "if this was the case , the line strength would increase with radius for spectra of the near side of the disk since the obscuration effect increases as one moves towards the disk rim in the near side . on the contrary , the observed caii line strength decreases with increasing radius in the spectra of the `` gas stream '' ( fig .  [ spec_disk ] ) as well as in the symmetric component of spectra extracted for the near side of the disk ( not shown here ) .",
    "the temperatures inferred for the inner disk regions ( @xmath82 , see section  [ temperatures ] ) are too high to allow for significant caii emission .",
    "thus , the caii absorption should be produced in intervening cooler gas along the line of sight .",
    "interesting inferences can be drawn from the dynamics of this intervening gas .",
    "gas rotating in keplerian orbits at this distance from the white dwarf should lead to broad ( fwhm @xmath83 ) and double - peaked absorption lines with no blueshift / redshift .",
    "the observed narrow , single - peaked and redshifted caii line indicates that the gas dynamics in the absorbing region is dominated by radial motion ( in opposition to azimuthal , keplerian motion ) .",
    "depending on where the absorption occurs along the line of sight , we may be witnessing gas outflow ( if absorption occurs closer to the orbital plane , at the far side of the disk ) or gas inflow ( if absorption occurs closer to the observer along the line of sight , at the near side of the disk ) .    in the radial outflow scenario dq",
    "her would be acting as a propeller ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , expelling gas from inside the magnetosphere towards larger radii .",
    "the corotation radius for dq  her ( @xmath84 ) is comparable to ( and even smaller than ) our lower estimate of the alfvn radius , suggesting that plasma blobs that attach to field lines at @xmath85 should be centrifugally accelerated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  7 ) .",
    "accordingly , one would expect to see blueshifted caii absorption in spectra of the near side of the disk in account of gas expelled towards the observer .",
    "however , contrary to this expectation , the caii absorption line is also redshifted both in the `` gas stream '' spectra and in the symmetric component of spectra extracted for the near side of the disk .",
    "additional problems with this scenario include the difficulties to explain why the outflow velocity would be so low ( @xmath86 ) , why it does not change with radius , and why no caii absorption is seen in the outer disk regions .",
    "the radial inflow alternative leads to a magnetically - controlled accretion scenario , in which the caii absorption line is produced when relatively cool regions of the accretion curtain are seen projected against hot gas in the background . inside the magnetosphere ( @xmath87 )",
    "two effects contribute to broaden the emission / absorption lines : ( i ) the gas corotates with the white dwarf magnetic field , the spin velocity of which increases with radius , @xmath88 ; ( ii ) at the same time , gas moves inwards along field lines with a radial velocity @xmath89 .",
    "because dq  her is a fast rotator , large azimuthal velocities ( @xmath90 ) are expected for the range of radii of interest , @xmath91 , and lines produced in this region should be quite broad . then , why is the caii line so narrow ?    at this point it is worth noting that because an eclipse map yields a snapshot of the eclipsed brightness distribution over a time scale much longer than the @xmath9 pulsation period , the contribution of the rapidly rotating magnetosphere to our spatially - resolved spectra is a time averaged spectrum over all orientations ( or , pulse phases ) . adopting the oblique dipole accretor model of (",
    "* see their fig .",
    "3 ) , significant absorption should occur around spin phase @xmath92  when the upper accretion curtain covers the largest portion of the hot inner magnetosphere and/or the ( also hot ) innermost regions of the far side of the accretion disk . however , at this orientation the spin component of the accretion curtain velocity field is mostly in the plane of the sky and the projected velocity along the line of sight is essencially @xmath93 .",
    "note that , at quadrature ( @xmath94 and 0.75 ) , the absorption of radiation by the upper accretion curtain is not only significantly reduced but is also smeared in wavelength because of the contribution of a large spin velocity component to the line profile .",
    "thus , the observed absorption line profile is dominated by the spectral contribution of the accretion curtains at @xmath95 .",
    "the magnetically - controled accretion scenario implies radial inflow velocities of @xmath96 , significantly lower than both the rotational and the free - fall velocities for that range of radii .",
    "this is line with inferences drawn by @xcite , who pointed out that , for rapidly rotating intermediate polars , the accretion shock may occur almost at @xmath97 and the infall from @xmath97 to the white dwarf surface is unlikely to have a significant radial component .      in this section",

    "[ ew ] shows the radial intensity distribution for the lines and for the adjacent continuum ( top ) , the radial intensity distribution for the net line emission ( second row from top ) , the radial run of the equivalent width ( ew , third row from top ) and the radial run of the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm , bottom ) .",

    "moreover , in order to reconcile the keplerian velocity distribution with the observed fwhm values , an unrealistically low - mass white dwarf ( @xmath108 ) would be needed .",
    "it is therefore likely that the disk gas has sub - keplerian velocities .",

    "we discuss possible interpretations for the asymmetries seen in the low - velocity eclipse maps of the h@xmath6 and heii @xmath1 lines .",

    "* see their figs .  3 and 8) because this would affect both line and continuum maps , whereas in dq  her the asymmetries",
    "are only seen at specific velocity - resolved eclipse maps of particular emission lines . additionally , the disk opening angle is not large enough to result in measurable obscuration or limb - darkening effects ( see section  [ mem ] ) .",
    "the asymmetries observed in the h@xmath6 and heii @xmath1 line maps seem to be of a different nature , related to something not previously seen in eclipse mapping experiments .",
    "dq  her is the first intermediate polar being eclipse mapped .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the structures seen in the low - velocity heii and h@xmath6 maps in terms of the projection onto the orbital plane of accretion columns / curtains formed over the magnetic poles of the white dwarf by the channeled material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) above the disk is projected a distance @xmath178 towards the back of the disk and is distorted by the intrinsic azimuthal smearing effect of the eclipse mapping method @xcite . with our choice of azimuthal blur width @xmath179 ( section  [ mem ] ) , any point source in the eclipse maps will appear smeared in azimuth by @xmath180 . ] . in this scenario , due to",
    "different opacities for incoming irradiating photons , and energies needed to ionize atoms and to excite electrons to the upper energy levels of each transition , the regions of the accretion curtains close to the magnetic poles are prone to reprocess the strong irradiation by hard x - rays photons whereas regions farther away receive less energetic photons .",
    "hence , high - excitation lines such as heii @xmath1 trace the emission in the accretion curtains regions closer to the magnetic poles , whereas the low - excitation balmer lines trace emission from regions farther away from the x - ray emitting magnetic poles . lines of different excitation frame different parts of the accretion flow and , individually , yield only a partial view of the emitting accretion curtains . according to this , a better view of the accretion curtains",
    "may be obtained by combining the complementary high - excitation heii map with the low - excitation h@xmath6 map .",
    "an eclipse map obtained by combining the net line emission heii @xmath1 and h@xmath6 low - velocity eclipse maps is shown in fig .",
    "[ disk_soma ] .",
    "a remarkable structure resembling a twisted dipole emitting pattern can be seen near disk center .",
    "although this figure encourages one to further pursue this line of reasoning , it poses an immediate problem .",
    "each eclipse map yields a snapshot of the disk brightness distribution averaged over the period covered by the 4 eclipses .",
    "therefore , because it comprises a timescale much longer than the 71@xmath28 spin period of the white dwarf , changes in brightness distribution caused by the varying aspect of the accretion curtains with the white dwarf rotation should be completely smeared out in the eclipse map  just as in a long exposure picture of a moving target .",
    "how could one then obtain a coherent image of fast rotating accretion curtains in an eclipse map ?",
    "the answer can be built in terms of the selection in velocity for the accreting material performed by the application of spectral mapping techniques .",
    "the velocity field for gas in the accretion curtains is a sum of its inflowing component ( along the magnetic field lines ) and a rotational component ( due to the white dwarf spin period ) .",
    "as seen in sections  [ spectra ]  and  [ emission ] , the velocity field is dominated by the rotational component , which is significantly larger than the inflowing component . at most rotation phases ( i.e. , curtain orientations ) , different parts of the curtains",
    "show distinct projected velocities along the line of sight and their emission will split onto several different velocity bins across the emission line profile .",
    "conversely , a specific velocity - resolved eclipse map will contain a mixture of different parts of the accretion curtains at different rotation phases .",
    "this slicing and mixing effect prevents one from obtaining a coherent image of the accretion curtains at all velocity - resolved eclipse maps , with the fortunate exception of the low - velocity bin .    when the curtains are aligned with the binary axis",
    " and only at this orientation  the rotational component will be suppressed ( because it becomes orthogonal to the line of sight ) , and the curtains will show only the small inflowing velocity component ( see section  [ spectra ] ) , contributing to the same particular low - velocity bin .",
    "we note that two effects contribute to further reduce the observed projected velocity : ( i ) the inflow velocity must decrease after the accretion shock until it reaches zero at the white dwarf surface , and ( ii ) for accretion curtains twisted off the orbital plane , regions close to the magnetic poles present the lowest projected velocity along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , looking at a low velocity bin is equivalent of framing the accretion curtains always at the same two spin phases ( where the curtains are oriented at an azimuth roughly aligned with the binary main axis ) , allowing one to obtain a coherent image of them .",
    "a further question is why the accretion curtains lag the binary main axis by @xmath181 .",
    "@xcite applied doppler tomography techniques to spin - pulse spectroscopy of intermediate polars to find that the optical pulsation arises from azimuthally - extended accretion curtains , located typically a few white dwarf radii from disk center .",
    "his tomogram of the slow rotator pq  gem shows a twist in the accretion curtains , with material feeding onto magnetic field lines @xmath182 ahead of the location at which it hits the white dwarf .",
    "this is the opposite case of what is seen in dq  her and the difference may be in the spin period . for comparable magnetic field strengths and mass accretion rates a slow rotator ( the case of pq  gem , @xmath183 ) picks material at a magnetospheric radius with higher ( keplerian ) velocity than the accretion curtains .",
    "thus , the accretion curtains tend to step ahead of the magnetic pole .",
    "on the other hand , in a fast rotator ( the case of dq her , @xmath184 ) the field lines at the magnetosphere are rotating faster than the disk gas being channelled onto the field lines ( see section  [ emission ] ) . in this case",
    "the accretion curtains tends to lag the magnetic pole .",
    "we applied eclipse mapping techniques to spectroscopy covering 4 eclipses of dq  her in order to isolate the emission from different parts of its accretion flow as well as from outside the orbital plane .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "velocity - resolved eclipse maps of the h@xmath6 and heii @xmath1 lines indicate the presence of an azimuthally- and vertically - extended bright spot at disk rim ( at r@xmath185 ) , which is an important source of reprocessing of x - rays from the magnetic poles .",
    "this is in line with the conclusion that the bright spot is the main site of the @xmath9 optical pulsations in dq  her @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the inner regions the disk spectrum is flat with no balmer or helium lines , suggesting that the emission arises from _ bremsstrahlung _ radiation by an optically thin gas . in the intermediate and outer disk regions the spectrum shows double - peaked emission lines typical of a rotating disk gas .",
    "the slope of the continuum becomes progressively redder with increasing radius , indicating the existence of a radial temperature gradient .",
    "we fit lte hi emission models to the flux and slope of the continuum in order to infer the temperature and the surface density of the emitting gas .",
    "the surface density increases by six orders of magnitude from the inner to the outer disk regions .",
    "the temperatures are in the range @xmath186 ( for @xmath187\\,r_{l1}$ ] ) and can be reasonably well described by a steady - state disk with a mass accretion rate of @xmath188 .",
    "the strong emission lines with shallow balmer decrement observed in the outer disk regions are in contrast to the low temperatures inferred from the slope of the continuum , suggesting an outer disk structure with a hot and optically thin chromosphere ( responsible for the emission lines ) on top of a cool , opaque and dense disk photosphere ( responsible for the continuum emission ) .",
    "the narrow and redshifted caii @xmath4 absorption line in the total light spectra and the inverse p - cygni profiles of the balmer and heii @xmath1 emission lines in spectra of the asymmetric component of the eclipse maps indicate radial inflow of gas in the inner disk regions ( @xmath61 ) , and are best explained in terms of magnetically - controlled accretion inwards of the white dwarf magnetosphere in dq  her .",
    "we infer projected radial inflow velocities of @xmath189 , significantly lower than both the rotational and the free - fall velocities for the corresponding range of radii .",
    "the combined net emission heii plus h@xmath6 low - velocity eclipse map shows a twisted dipole emitting pattern near disk center .",
    "this is interpreted as being the projection of accretion curtains onto the orbital plane at two specific spin phases , as a consequence of the selection in velocity provided by the spectral eclipse mapping .",
    "this is in line with and strengthen the above inference .",
    "the spectrum of the uneclipsed light is dominated by balmer and hei lines in emission with narrow absorption cores .",

    "<S> we report an eclipse mapping study of the intermediate polar dq  her based on time - resolved optical spectroscopy ( @xmath0 ) covering 4 eclipses . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were sliced into 295 narrow passbands in the continuum and in the lines , and the corresponding light curves were analysed to solve for a set of monochromatic maps of the disk brightness distribution and for the flux of an additional uneclipsed component in each band . eclipse maps of the heii @xmath1 line indicate that an azimuthally- and vertically - extended bright spot at disk rim is important source of reprocessing of x - rays from the magnetic poles . </S>",
    "<S> the disk spectrum is flat with no balmer or helium lines in the inner regions , and shows double - peaked emission lines in the intermediate and outer disk regions while the slope of the continuum becomes progressively redder with increasing radius . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred disk temperatures are in the range @xmath2 and can be reasonably well described by a steady - state disk with mass accretion rate of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the radial intensity distribution for the balmer lines reveals a linear correlation between the slope of the distribution and the transition energy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the uneclipsed light is dominated by balmer and hei lines in emission ( probably from the extended nova shell ) with narrow absorption cores ( likely from a collimated and optically thick wind from the accretion disk ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed narrow and redshifted caii @xmath4 absorption line in the total light spectra plus the inverse p - cygni profiles of the balmer and heii @xmath1 emission lines in spectra of the asymmetric component indicate radial inflow of gas in the innermost disk regions and are best explained in terms of magnetically - controlled accretion inside the white dwarf magnetosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we infer projected radial inflow velocities of @xmath5 , significantly lower than both the rotational and the free - fall velocities for the corresponding range of radii . </S>",
    "<S> a combined net emission heii plus h@xmath6 low - velocity eclipse map reveals a twisted dipole emitting pattern near disk center . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as being the projection of accretion curtains onto the orbital plane at two specific spin phases , as a consequence of the selection in velocity provided by the spectral eclipse mapping . </S>"
