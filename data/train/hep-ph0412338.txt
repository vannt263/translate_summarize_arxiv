    "one expects that non - linear effects will enter the bfkl equation in the non - perturbative infrared region , _",
    "i.e. _ at large impact parameters .",
    "this is a different regime from that connected with the black disk limit ( bdl ) , in which saturation occurs at small impact parameters first .",
    "the common viewpoint is that saturation will lead to a decrease of the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "but the estimates of the energy after which saturation will be important vary a lot between different models .",
    "unitarity of the scattering matrix is connected with the properties of the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation , which is equivalent at high energy to a decomposition in partial waves .",
    "the scattering amplitude can then saturate the unitarity bound for impact parameters @xmath1 . to satisfy the unitarity condition",
    ", there are different models .",
    "two of them are based on the solution of the unitarity equation @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , in the @xmath3matrix approach  @xcite , one obtains a ratio @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "the second possible solution of the unitarity condition , which is the usual one , corresponds to the eikonal representation @xmath6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 .",
    "if one takes the eikonal phase in a factorised form @xmath8 , one usually supposes that , despite the fact that the energy dependence of @xmath9 can be a power @xmath10 , the total cross section will satisfy the froissart bound @xmath11 .",
    "we find in fact that the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the amplitude and hence of the total cross section depends on the form of @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 dependence of the slope of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "let us first take a gaussian for the eikonal phase @xmath15 . as was made first by landau , let us introduce the new variable @xmath16 .",
    "we can then calculate the integral exactly and obtain that @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and , in our case , @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is independent from @xmath13 , we have @xmath22 , whereas if @xmath21 grows not faster then @xmath23 , the total cross section becomes proportional to the froissart bound @xmath24 .",
    "however , let us now take a polynomial form @xmath25 .",
    "such a form comes , for example , from the bfkl equation . in that case",
    ", we can introduce the new variable @xmath26 and obtain @xmath27 \\   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\ 2 \\sqrt{\\pi } \\",
    "s^{\\delta/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , in this case , the scattering amplitude eventually violates the froissart bound !    if we introduce an additional small constant radius @xmath28 which removes the singular point @xmath29 in @xmath12 and take @xmath30 $ ] , the answer , after some complicated algebra , is @xmath31\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\left[i_{0}\\left(\\frac{s^{\\delta}}{2r^4}\\right ) + i_{1}\\left(\\frac{s^{\\delta}}{2r^4}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the asymptotic value of the modified bessel functions is @xmath32 we again obtain for asymptotically high energies @xmath33     dependence ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    ", width=283 ]    finally , let us consider the more complicated ( but most interesting ) case , of an exponential form for @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude in the @xmath14 representation is @xmath35 . \\ ] ] with @xmath36 , and where the function @xmath37 is the hyper - geometric function .",
    "a numerical estimate of this integral shows that we obtain for the exponential form of the eikonal an energy dependence of the scattering amplitude in the @xmath14-representation which can be approximated as @xmath38 , with large coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev@xmath41 .",
    "hence , in this case , the scattering amplitude obeys the froissart bound , but with a large scale @xmath42 and a large coefficient @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a weak energy dependence at moderate energies followed by a fast growth at super - high energies .",
    "of course the eikonal representation , which most of the time leads to a unitarity answer at every impact parameter , leads to amplitudes which do not saturate at finite energy : the eikonal representation for the scattering amplitude in @xmath44-space , in the form @xmath45 , reaches the bdl only asymptotically .",
    "however , this representation is not the only possibility , and it may be more useful to consider the effects of saturation by considering parametrisations in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , transforming them to impact parameter space , and imposing directly the bdl as an upper bound on the amplitude in @xmath13 and @xmath44 .",
    "a different approach to saturation is found in the studies of the non - linear saturation processes , which have been considered in a perturbative qcd context @xcite .",
    "such processes lead to an infinite set of coupled evolution equations in energy for the correlation functions of multiple wilson lines @xcite . in the approximation where the correlation functions for more than two wilson lines factorise , the problem reduces to the non - linear balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "it is unclear how to extend these results to the non - perturbative region , but one will probably obtain a similar equation .",
    "in fact we found simple differential equations that reproduce either the u - matrix or the eikonal representation .",
    "we can first consider saturation equations of the general form    @xmath46    with @xmath47 the true ( saturated ) imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "we shall impose that ( a ) @xmath48 as @xmath49 , ( b ) @xmath50 as @xmath49 , ( c ) @xmath51 has a taylor expansion in @xmath47 , with the hard pomeron @xmath52 as a first term .",
    "this enables us to fix the integration constant by demanding that the first term of the expansion in @xmath53 reduces to @xmath54 .",
    "inspired by the bk results , we shall use the evolution variable @xmath55 .",
    "if we want to fulfil condition ( c ) , then we need to take @xmath56 .",
    "conditions ( a ) and ( b ) then give @xmath57 as the simplest saturating function .",
    "the resulting equation @xmath58 has the solution @xmath59 one can in fact go further : eq . ( [ satu1 ] ) has been written for the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "if we want to generalise it to a complex amplitude , so that it reduces to ( [ satu1 ] ) when the real part vanishes , we must take : @xmath60 the solution of this is exactly the form obtained in the u - matrix formalism , for @xmath61 .",
    "many other unitarisation schemes are possible , depending on the function @xmath62 .",
    "we shall simply indicate here that the eikonal scheme can be obtained as follows : @xmath63 other unitarisation equations can be easily obtained via another first - order equation .",
    "the idea here is that the saturation variable is the imaginary part of the bare amplitude .",
    "one can then write @xmath64\\ { \\cal s}'(n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 the unsaturated amplitude .    this will trivially obey the conditions ( a)-(c ) above , and saturate at @xmath65 .",
    "choosing @xmath66 gives the eikonal solution whereas @xmath67 leads to the u - matrix representation ( [ solu ] ) .",
    "we have thus shown that the most usual unitarization schemes could be recast into differential equations which are reminiscent of saturation equations @xcite . such an approach can be used to build new unitarization schemes and may also shed some light on the physical processes underlying the saturation regime .",
    "in the presence of the hard pomeron @xcite , the saturation effects can change the behaviour of some features of the cross sections already at lhc energies .",
    "some forms of the eikonal phase in the factorising eikonal representation can lead to a violation of the froissart bound .",
    "non - linear effects which work in the whole energy region supply an acceptable growth of the total cross sections .",
    "saturation leads to a relative growth of the contribution of peripheral interactions .",
    "the most usual unitarization schemes could be recast into differential equations which are reminiscent of saturation equations such an approach can be used to build new unitarization schemes and may also shed some light on the physical processes underlying the saturation regime .",
