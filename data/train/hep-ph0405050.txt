    "the origin of fermion masses and mixings is an outstanding open problem in particle physics . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking and mass generation via _ ad - hoc _",
    "yukawa couplings .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the sm is not the final model and a complete study of the coupling of the lightest boson , which we will call the higgs boson , to fermions can provide hints on new physics beyond the sm .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we performed a realistic simulation of the process @xmath6 , where @xmath7 can be an electron , muon or tau neutrino , in the environment of a future linear collider with a center - of - mass energy of @xmath8 gev with an accumulated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath9 , based on the tesla design @xcite .",
    "in particular , we noticed that weak gauge boson fusion is the dominant contribution to the subset of diagrams containing the higgs boson for @xmath10 gev at @xmath11 gev and hence this process is sensitive to the higgs boson couplings to @xmath5-quarks .",
    "we have used a similar technique to investigated the possibility of detecting deviations from the sm in the higgs couplings to @xmath12-leptons at future @xmath13 colliders @xcite , which can be improved by using @xmath12 spin correlations @xcite .    in this brief report",
    ", we update the result @xcite by combining it with the results of a detailed analysis of the process @xmath3 .",
    "this process has a very clean final state , with no missing energy and easy reconstruction , which can compensate for its smaller rate .",
    "it certainly must be included in a global analysis of the @xmath0 vertex .    in order to perform our analysis",
    ", we will assume that the higgs boson has already been discovered at the large hadron collider and concentrate on the determination of its coupling to @xmath5-quarks . in extensions of the sm with extra scalars and pseudoscalars",
    ", the lightest spin-0 particle can be an admixture of states without a definite parity .",
    "hence , we parametrize the general @xmath0 coupling as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 is the @xmath5-quark mass and @xmath17 , @xmath18 in the sm . in cp - violating extensions of the sm ,",
    "deviations of these parameters may be generated at tree - level @xcite .",
    "we will present results considering @xmath4 and @xmath5 as independent parameters and also for the cases of fixed @xmath19 , free @xmath5 and fixed @xmath20 , free @xmath4 .",
    "there is a region of insensivity around circles in the @xmath21 plane since we ca nt at this level of analysis disentangle the effects of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in the sm",
    "the @xmath22 process is determined by 50 feynman diagrams .",
    "only 2 of these ( higgs radiative production , @xmath23 , and vector boson fusion , @xmath24 ) can be considered as signal , where deviations from sm higgs couplings to @xmath5-quarks show up .",
    "the remaining diagrams are not changed by new physics in the higgs sector .",
    "the total sm cross section for the process @xmath22 is approximately @xmath25 fb for @xmath26 gev at @xmath8 gev , with cuts in the scattering angle between initial and final electrons@xmath27 , and in the final electron - positron invariant mass , @xmath28 gev .",
    "the angular cut avoids the region of @xmath29 around the pipeline , used by the beam pipe itself and by the small angle monitor ( sam ) for luminosity measurements .",
    "the invariant mass cut insures that the electrons and positrons will be detected in the lead glass calorimeter @xcite .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath30 , @xmath31 , etc , can be reduced to the @xmath32 fb level by appropriate cuts@xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we will assume sm couplings of the higgs to the electroweak gauge bosons . a full analysis taking into account non",
    "- sm hww and hzz couplings would introduce many more parameters and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we performed our monte carlo simulation by generating observables represented as series in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings multiplied by kinematical factors : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is any observable and the @xmath35 terms are purely kinematical structures which do not contain any @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence and results from the amplitude squaring and phase space integration . in this way",
    "we only simulate the process once for each observable . in our case ,",
    "terms linear in @xmath5 parameter vanish and hence @xmath36 .",
    "we have studies the following observables : transverse @xmath5-quark momentum @xmath37 , @xmath38 invariant mass @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the scattering angle between the @xmath5-jet and initial beam directions , and the @xmath42 correlation , defined by @xmath43 .",
    "the event sample reproducing the expected statistics at tesla was generated using our monte carlo package while the detector response was simulated with the code simdet version 3.01@xcite .",
    "we assume an efficiency for @xmath44jet pair reconstruction of @xmath45 % , which is based on the @xmath5-tag algorithm , as assumed in ref . @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we used @xmath46 gev .    in figure [ distributions ]",
    "we show , for comparison purposes , the differential distributions in the invariant @xmath38 mass and @xmath40 , for the total sm contribution and for the higgs contribution only ( including interference with sm ) . notice the @xmath47-boson peak and the smaller higgs peak in the @xmath39 distribution , and how the higgs contribution dominates around its peak .",
    "cm    = 1 -4.5 cm = 1    = 1    -5.5 cm    in order to demonstrate the effect of different values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we show in figure [ ab ] the @xmath40 distribution arising from the higgs contribution for the sm ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) compared to the case with @xmath17 , @xmath48 .",
    "we see that the shapes are very similar , as expected , but the levels can be noticeable different .",
    "another important aspect is the assumption about the detector performance and possible sources of the systematic uncertaintes .",
    "we include the anticipated systematic errors of 0.5% in the luminosity measurement , 1% in the acceptance determination , 1% in the branching ratios , and 1% in the background substraction , and assume the gaussian nature of the sytematics @xcite . to place bounds on the @xmath0 couplings , we use a standard @xmath49-criterion to analyse the events .",
    "after various kinematical distributions were examined , we found that the most strict bounds are achieved from @xmath40 distribution by dividing the distribution event samples into 10 bins .",
    "the experimental error @xmath50 for the @xmath51 bin is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the sum in quadrature of the systematic uncertainties mentioned above .",
    "below we present our final results for a tesla - like environment @xcite with a center - of - mass energy of 500 gev and for @xmath55 gev .",
    "we investigated three possible scenarios for the luminosities : 100 fb@xmath9 , 1 ab@xmath9 and 10 ab@xmath9 .",
    "the bounds that can be obtained at 95% confidence level from @xmath22 process on the @xmath56 and @xmath5 parameters are : @xmath57 for the case of @xmath20 and free @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the case of @xmath60 and free @xmath5 .",
    "we will combine these limits with our previous bounds from the @xmath2 process according to the following procedure .",
    "given two bounds on the same quantitity @xmath61 , say @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the combined bound will be @xmath64 and the statistical weights @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of events for each process .    with these prescription",
    "we obtain the improved bounds : @xmath70 for the case of @xmath20 and free @xmath58 and @xmath71 for the case of @xmath72 and free @xmath5 .",
    "these results can be roughly scaled for moderate variations in the higgs boson mass around @xmath73 gev by multiplying the bounds by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "we have performed an update in our previous constraints on deviations of the @xmath0 coupling from its sm value by including a complete analysis of the sensitivity due to the process @xmath75 at the next generation of linear colliders .",
    "these deviations are predicted by many extensions of the standard model .",
    "we improved our previous bounds by roughly @xmath76% .",
    "we showed that future @xmath77 linear collider experiments will be able to probe deviations of @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the weak gauge boson fusion process is instrumental for achieving such a precision . for a tesla - like environment , we are able to constrain the couplings at the level of a few percent for the @xmath4 parameter ( for fixed @xmath5 ) and tens of percent for the @xmath5 parameter ( for fixed @xmath4 ) .",
    "these results are comparable to the study performed in @xcite , where a global fit analysis for @xmath78 fb@xmath9 and @xmath8 gev has resulted in a relative accuracy of @xmath79% in the @xmath80 yukawa coupling . for comparison , the top quark yukawa coupling can be determined with a statistical accuracy of 16% at the lhc for @xmath81 gev @xcite .",
    "in our analysis we can not disentangle the contributions from deviations in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters .",
    "however , notice that the partial width @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "our distributions have a different dependence @xmath84 therefore , if an independent measurement of @xmath82 is obtained ( for instance , from on - mass - shell higgs production in higgs - strahlung or in a muonic collider ) , one would be able to separate the @xmath4 and @xmath5 contributions and obtain an explicit indication of cp violation in the higgs sector .",
