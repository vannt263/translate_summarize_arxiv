    "ionic systems have been studied for decades and significant progress has been achieved , to a great deal thanks to the important contribution by george stell .",
    "his studies concerned in particular the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) . in the rpm equisized hard cores carry charges with equal magnitude and are immersed in structureless solvent . already in 1976",
    "george stell predicted phase separation into ion - poor and ion - rich phases with the associated critical point@xcite . in 1992 stell",
    "published very strong arguments that despite the long - range of the coulomb potential the critical point in the rpm belongs to the ising university class @xcite .",
    "the ising universalty class was confirmed later by field - theoretic methods  @xcite and by the hierarchical reference and collective variables theories @xcite .",
    "the stell prediction was verified by simulations in 2002  @xcite .    in reality",
    "the coulomb potential often competes with the specific van der waals interactions and , in particular in the case of charged globular proteins or colloid particles in complex solvents , with various solvent - induced effective interactions .",
    "moreover , the size , shape and charge of the positively and negatively charged ions or particles can be different .",
    "this difference is moderate in room temperature ionic liquids ( rtil ) , but in the case of charged globular proteins in solvents containing microscopic counterions the size- and charge ratio becomes @xmath2 , and it increases even to @xmath3 in the case of colloid particles .",
    "the size- and charge asymmetry , as well as the competing non - coulombic interactions both may lead to spacial inhomogeneities on the length scale larger than the size of ions or charged particles .",
    "one of the first theoretial observations of the instability of the homogeneous phase with respect to periodic charge- or number - density distribution was made by stell and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneitis , in particular clusters , networks or layers , or exotic crystals , were observed also in experiments and simulations  @xcite .",
    "instability with respect to periodic distribution of particles in space competes with the phase separation , and may lead to quite complex phase behavior  @xcite .    despite the progress in studies of ionic systems and charged particles , many important questions remain open , because accurate description of systems with mesoscopic inhomogeneities remains a challenge .",
    "liquid matter theories , such as the generalized mean - spherical approximation or the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza )  @xcite work very well for simple liquids .",
    "in particular , scoza yields globally accurate phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "theories like scoza and hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) include fluctuations over all length scales ; the limitation of scoza and hrt is that no solutions are found when a uniform state becomes unstable with respect to a modulated phase  @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to obtain solutions in the liquid - matter theories for inhomogeneous systems with competing interactions , such as the short - range attraction and long - range repulsion potential ( salr ) .",
    "nevertheless , some features due to the salr potential can and have been studied  @xcite .",
    "in particular , enhanced density fluctuations , a tendency towards cluster formation and a growth of the compressibility in a large density and temperature interval close to the liquid - vapour transition was observed by pini et al . in the case of weak repulsion  @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities that occur at the microscopic length scale near external surfaces are successfuly described by the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . however , in the case of spontaneously occurying mesoscopic inhomogeneities the predictions of the dft deviate from the results of simulations more significantly than in simple fluids  @xcite .",
    "this is because fluctuations , such as displacements , reshaping , merging or splitting of the aggregates play an important role in these systems .",
    "the fluctuations can be taken into account in the brazovskii field theory ( bft )  @xcite relatively easily , but since this theory is of phenomenological nature , neither the equation of state ( eos ) nor the phase diagram in terms of real theromdynamic variables can be determined .",
    "note that the displacements , reshaping , merging or splitting of the aggregates can appear either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli , and one can expect that thermodynamic susceptibilities , in particular the compressibility and the specific heat , are much different than in homogeneous systems . since the complexity of these systems leads to serious technical difficulties , their structural , mechanical and thermal properties are not yet fully understood .",
    "the aggregates are periodically distributed in space in the ordered phases analogous to lyotropic liquid crystals , but in the _ inhomogeneous disordered phase _",
    ", analogous to microemulsion , the aggregates are ordered only locally .",
    "the salr and amphiphilic systems have similar properties , since as shown in ref.@xcite , both can be described by the brazovskii functional .",
    "( we should mention here that george stell studied the amphiphilic systems as well , in particular in ref .",
    "however , while the lyotropic liquid crystals in amphiphilic systems are quite common  @xcite , only disordered distribution of spherical or elonogated clusters was observed in the salr system by confocal microscopy  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if the observations concerned the disordered inhomogeneous phase , or just one state of the ordered phase and after averaging the distribution of the aggragates would be periodic .",
    "the ordered hexagonal and lamellar phases were obtained by molecular dynamics simulations , but the spherical clusters were not ordered periodically in this simulation  @xcite .",
    "* in recent mc simulations @xcite a similar sequence of phases as in ref.@xcite was obtained . *    in fig.[f0 ]",
    "we show a cartoon with schematic representation of a typical distribution of particles in the periodically ordered inhomogeneous phase , and in the disordered phase that is either inhomogeneous ( fig.[f0]b ) or homogeneous ( fig.[f0]c ) on the mesoscopic length scale .",
    "`` the disordered phase '' and `` the homogeneous phase '' are often treated as synonyms for the phase with the position - independent average density .",
    "however , the position - independent average density does not necessarily mean that the structure is homogeneous at the mesoscopic length scale in the majority of states ( see fig.[f0]b ) . here",
    "we call the phase with position - independent average density `` the disordered phase '' .",
    "the ordered periodic phases in the salr and amphiphilic systems are quite well described by the mean - field ( mf ) theories  @xcite . in the disordered inhomogeneous phase , however , the mesoscopic fluctuations play a key role , and its properties are not correctly predicted on the mf level .",
    "the aggragates are clearly seen in confocal microscope and in simulation snapshots , but due to fluctuations , the average volume fraction of the particles , @xmath4 , is position - independent , @xmath5 . for this reason one can not distinguish the inhomogeneous and homogeneous structure of the disordered phase based solely on the one - particle distribution function . in this work",
    "we propose a theoretical method of investigation of the disordered inhomogeneous phase , and apply the formalism to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) salr model with strong repulsion in order to calculate the eos .",
    "some information about properties of the disordered inhomogeneous phase was obtained in ref.@xcite , where a 1d lattice model with nearest - neighbor attraction and third - neighbor repulsion was solved exactly .",
    "when the repulsion is strong enough , then clusters consisting of three particles separated by three empty sites ( i.e. ... ooo ... ooo ... ooo ... ooo ... where `` . '' and `` o '' denote the empty and ocuppied site repectively ) are energetically favourable .",
    "the volume fraction of particles in this ordered structure , stable only at temperature @xmath6 , is @xmath7 .",
    "there are no phase transitions in 1d models with short - range interaction , but at low @xmath8 and @xmath9 the disordered phase turns out to be strongly inhomogeneous . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was found that for @xmath10 the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory decay with the period @xmath11 . for @xmath9",
    "the correlation length increases to very large values and the compressibility decreases to very small values for decreasing @xmath8 .",
    "the compressibility is small for @xmath9 , because the increase of @xmath1 leads to shorter separation between the clusters and to repulsion between them .",
    "large compressibility was obtained for @xmath1 that is either too small or too large for formation of the periodic structure that is favourable energetically .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath12 and pressure @xmath13 isotherms at low @xmath8 are much different than in simple fluids .",
    "when @xmath8 decreases , the slope of @xmath12 becomes very small for a range of both small and large @xmath1 , and very large for @xmath9 .",
    "the very small slope of @xmath12 was interpreted as pseudo phase transition between homgeneous very dilute or very dense phase , and the inhomogeneous phase present for @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath15 the pressure decreases for increasing @xmath8 , in contrast to simple fluids .",
    "properties of the two - dimensional and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems can be easily determined neither by exact calculations nor by simulations , due to large finite size effects and the collective motion of the aggregates .",
    "for this reason it is important to develop an approximate predictive theory and test its accuracy by comparison with the exact results obtained in the 1d model .",
    "development of a tractable theory that could allow for quantitative or at least semi - quantitative description of structural , mechanical and thermal properties of systems with mesoscopic inhomogeneities is our long - term goal . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have made first steps in this direction .",
    "the general formalism allows for investigation of disordered and periodically ordered phases , but the obtained equations are very difficult and in practice approximations are necessary . in order to verify quality of various approximations",
    ", one should compare the results with exact solutions that so far exist only for the disordered phase  @xcite . before considering the modulated phases ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the disordered phase to verify various approximate schemes .    in this work",
    "we further develop our theory that combines liquid - matter theory , dft and bft methods .",
    "the present version of the approximate theory is based to a large extent on the derivation described in ref.@xcite , and summarized briefly in sec.2 .",
    "we focus on a one - component system . in the context of charged particles",
    "this means that we integrate out the degrees of freedom of the counterions , and consider screened electrostatic potential between the charged particles .",
    "the explicit counterions can be considered within our formalism at a later stage .",
    "the self - consistent gaussian appoximation developed in ref.@xcite is rather simple and yields results that agree qualitatively with majority of the exact results obtained for the 1d lattice model  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it turned out that in the case of the 3d salr model in continuum space our equation for the direct correlation function has no solutions for the phase space region where inhomogeneities are expected .",
    "it resembles the above mentioned lack of solution in the scoza . to overcome this problem , in this work",
    "we develop a theory beyond the gaussian approximation . in sec.3 a hierarchy of equations relating the many - point correlation and direct correlation functions for mesoscopic volume fraction is constructed .",
    "we make an approximation for the direct four - point correlations , and obtain an equation relating the two - point correlation and direct correlation functions that together with the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation form a closed set of equations .",
    "finally , we obtain expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 which contain contributions resulting from the mesoscopic fluctuations . in sec.4 the results obtained in the approximate theory for the 1d lattice model",
    "are compared with the exact results of ref .",
    "the agreement is much better than in the gaussian approximation . in sec.5",
    "we present results of our theory for the 3d salr model with both the attractive and the repulsive part of the interaction potential having the yukawa form .",
    "we choose two sets of parameters , both favouring periodic distribution of particles over the homogeneous state . in the first model",
    "the attraction range is very short and the repulsion barrier is small . for this potential ,",
    "small clusters are formed and the gas - liquid separation is energetically unfavourable compared to the homogeneous state . in the second model",
    "the attraction range and the repulsion barrier are both larger .",
    "larger clusters are formed and the gas - liquid separation is energetically favourable over the homogeneous state . in mf approximation the phase diagrams of the two models are very similar  @xcite . here ,",
    "we ask if the effects of fluctuations on the shape of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 curves depend on the range and amplitude of the attractive and the repulsive part of the interaction potential .",
    "sec.6 contains summary and discussion .",
    "we consider systems with inhomogeneities on a length scale significantly larger than the size of molecules @xmath16 ( see fig.[f0]b ) . in our theory  @xcite a mesoscopic volume fraction is described by a smooth function @xmath17 equal to the fraction of the volume of the mesoscopic region with a center at @xmath18 that is covered by the particles . by fixing the mesoscopic state given by @xmath17 we impose a constraint on the available microstates .",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential in the presence of this constraint is denoted by @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "after removal of the constraint mesoscopic fluctuations may appear , and the grand potential is given by  @xcite @xmath20-k_bt\\ln\\bigg(\\int d\\phi e^{-\\beta h_f}\\bigg)\\ ] ] with @xmath21 , @xmath22 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath23=\\omega_{co}[\\bar\\zeta+\\phi]-\\omega_{co}[\\bar\\zeta],\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the average volume fraction , and @xmath25 is the mesoscopic fluctuation .",

    "however , we do not obtain quantitative agreement at this level of approximation .",
    "when the criterion ( [ criterion ] ) is not satisfied , i.e. for low @xmath193 , van der waals loops in @xmath165 are predicted in our theory , although in reality only pseudo phase transitions occur in this model .",
    "thus , when the necessary condition ( [ criterion ] ) is violated , the theory is overesimplified indeed .",
    "we have made preliminary calculations for @xmath165 in the @xmath276 theory ( not presented here ) and obtained very similar shapes of the lines , and reasonably good quantitative agreement with the exact results for @xmath209 . in the @xmath276 theory",
    "the van der waals loops appear for lower @xmath193 than in the @xmath85 theory .",
    "thus , systematic improvement of accuracy of the results is indeed possible within the general framework of our theory . in order to obtain better accuracy for @xmath277 and @xmath278 , the term associated with @xmath38",
    "should be included in eq.([g4 ] ) .",
    "we applied our theory to two versions of the 3d salr model ( eq.([int_pot_r ] ) ) described and discussed in sec.5 . in system 1",
    "the phase separation into homogeneous dilute and dense phases is strongly unfavourable energetically and the periodic structure with the most probable period is only weakly favoured compared to the homogeneous structure . in system 2 the optimal periodic structure is strongly favourable , and the phase separation is weakly favourable energetically compared to a homogeneous structure with given @xmath1 .",
    "the mf phase diagrams for the two considered versions of the 3d salr model are nearly the same  @xcite .",
    "it is well known , however that the ordered phases are stable for much lower temperature than predicted by mf .",
    "our aim was investigation of the structure and the eos in the high-@xmath8 part of the mf instability region of the homogeneous phase , where weakly ordered phases are predicted by mf , but in reality a disordered inhomogeneous phase is stable .",
    "our results show the anomalous decrease of pressure for increasing @xmath8 for a range of @xmath254 in both systems .",
    "apart from this common feature , the effects of fluctuations depend very strongly on the shape of the interaction potential . in the repulsion - dominated system 1 and in system 2 where neither repulsion nor attraction dominates , the eos is qualitatively different ( see figs.[ps1 ] and [ ps2 ] ) .",
    "the disordering effects of fluctuations are much stronger in system 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 lines is much more complex in system 2 .",
    "in system 1 we do not obtain any rapid change of the compressibility for increasing @xmath1 even for very small @xmath193 .",
    "unfortunately , for small @xmath193 the theory is overesimplified , especially for @xmath257 , and we can not draw definite conclusions concerning the phase transition between the dilute gas and inhomogeneous phases .",
    "for @xmath254 we do not obtain large compressibility that would indicate an approach to a phase transition between the inhomogeneous phase and the dense liquid even for temperature as low as @xmath279 ( in reduced units ) .",
    "in contrast , in system 2 the compressibility changes rapidly for increasing @xmath1 even for relatively high @xmath193 , and van der waals loops occur at sufficiently low @xmath193 .",
    "the van der waals loops suggest that phase transitions or pseudo phase transitions between the gas and liquid phases , and the _ disordered inhomogeneous phase _ stable for intermediate volume fractions occur . based on the comparison with the 1d case",
    ", however , we expect that pseudo - phase transitions , indicating significant structural changes in the disordered phase , occur when @xmath193 is high",
    ". note that within the stability region of the disordered phase the gas , the cluster fluid and the percolating fluid are distinguished in the recent simulations  @xcite .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that for intermediate @xmath193 and @xmath1 the _ disordered inhomogeneous phase _ is a thermodynamically distinct phase that can coexist with the homogeneous dilute and dense phases .",
    "for low @xmath193 we may expect stability of the ordered periodic phases for intermediate @xmath1 , and transitions between the disordered and the ordered phases .    at present",
    "we can only speculate about the phase behavior , because we have considered neither periodic phases nor phases with orientational order ( anisotropic correlation functions ) .",
    "we can not exclude phase transitions between inhomogeneous phases with different degree of order when @xmath193 decreases .",
    "however , such transitions can not be investigated with the assumptions of @xmath280 and isotropic correlations that we have made in this work .",
    "we shall investigate phases with anisotropic correlations and the periodically ordered phases in our future studies .",
    "we conclude that the theory developed in this work can be a convenient tool for studying inhomogeneous systems .",
    "further studies are necessary for developing an approximation within our general framework that would yield more accurate results on the quantitative level .",
