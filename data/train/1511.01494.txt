    "consistency with solar system tests of scalar - tensor theories @xcite additionally requires that standard general relativity is recovered in our local environment , which can be ensured in @xmath0 theories by the so - called _ chameleon _ screening mechanism @xcite that suppresses the deviation from standard gravity in high - density environments such as the milky way .",

    "hence voids provide the opportunity to test the transition between these two regimes .",
    "several works have been focusing on measuring the void abundance and its deviation from the expectations of the standard @xmath114cdm model in the context of various non - standard cosmologies ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , for the case of @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "some of these works @xcite have shown that there is an excess of large voids compared to @xmath114cdm , and that the excess is larger for larger values of the @xmath79 parameter .",
    "this confirms the intuitive prediction that the action of the fifth force pushes the particles stronger towards the void wall @xcite , thereby more efficiently evacuating the void centres . however , most of these analysis are based on cosmic voids identified in some random subsampling of the dark matter density field , while voids are generally identified in galaxy surveys .",
    "the effect of the tracer bias and of the cdm particle sampling on analytical predictions for the void abundance is still an unsolved issue for the standard @xmath114cdm case ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have compared the abundance and the density profiles of voids identified using the halo catalogs of some @xmath0 simulations to the case where voids are identified in a random subsample of cdm particles , finding that the deviations with respect to the @xmath7cdm cosmology are much weaker when halos are used as density tracers .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by @xcite for interacting dark energy models . in this paper , we focus on void abundances and profiles detected in the simulations of @xcite using the vide void finder @xcite , based on the zobov code @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we adopt a slight modification @xcite of the void hierarchy classification provided by vide which allows to eliminate possible pathological voids and to obtain a converging void abundance when changing the sparsity of the density tracers .    specifically , for each @xmath0 model and for the standard gr simulations we have run vide on both a random subsampling of the cdm particles ( with an average density of @xmath128 particles per cubic mpc@xmath129 ) , and on the positions of the fof halos identified in the simulations ( having an average density of about @xmath130 halos per cubic mpc@xmath129 ) , both at @xmath3 . in order to avoid multiple counting of the volume included in sub - voids within a complex void hierarchy we have selected only the main voids , i.e. those voids that are not part of larger voids .",
    "furthermore , among these voids we have defined two selection criteria to remove possible pathological voids ( see @xcite ) , namely requiring a minimum void density @xmath131 lower than @xmath132 times the average density and a density contrast ( i.e. the density ratio between the density minimum @xmath131 and the void boundary @xmath133 ) larger than @xmath134 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if a given main void identified by vide does not fulfil both these criteria we remove it from our catalog and we promote all its first tier of sub - voids to the role of main voids . this selection procedure is then repeated until no pathological main voids are left in the sample .",
    "this procedure allows to obtain a robust sample of main voids whose abundance does converge ( down to the resolution scale allowed by the density of the tracers ) for different random sub - samplings of the original cdm density field or different densities of the fof halo sample .    in fig .",
    "[ nvfig ] we show the size distribution of cosmic voids identified as a function of their effective radius @xmath135 defined from the void volume @xmath136 assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the upper panel shows the result obtained for voids identified based on our random sub - sampling of the cdm particle distribution , while the lower panel displays the same quantity obtained from the fof halo catalog . in each panel ,",
    "the upper plot shows the number of voids as a function of their radius , where the error bars represent the poisson error associated with the number counts in each bin , while the lower plot shows the significance of the relative difference between each @xmath0 model and standard gr .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the two plots show a very different relative trend among the models .",
    "while in the halo voids sample we do not observe significant deviations between the different gravity models except for a mild excess of large voids for the @xmath114cdm and the @xmath137 case , in the cdm voids sample the trend is the opposite and presents a much higher significance , with all the @xmath0 scenarios showing a higher abundance of large voids as compared to @xmath7cdm .",
    "this stark difference in the relative behaviour of the expected size distribution of cosmic voids , when the latter are identified using a biased vs. an unbiased set of tracers of the underlying cdm density field , has been already pointed out by @xcite for the case of @xmath0 gravity , and more recently by @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the different bias that a population of halos within the same mass range is found to have in different gravity models : while the additional gravitational force acting in @xmath0 cosmologies is effective in evacuating the voids from the smooth cdm component , thereby increasing the amplitude of cdm density perturbations ( and consequently the size and depth of cosmic voids , see the next section ) , the bias of collapsed objects is substantially reduced in these scenarios with respect to standard gravity , so that the net effect on amplitude and size of perturbations in the halos population is reduced ( see@xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that this effect is still present for different void finders . in @xcite",
    "the authors used a spherical shell to identify voids in the distribution of halos .",
    "in this case the authors had find a ratio of the number of voids in @xmath0 gravity to gr of @xmath138 for @xmath139 in the @xmath121 case , while we do not measure a lower number of voids on this scale . therefore using the abundance of voids to discriminate between gr and @xmath0 gravity",
    "must be taken with some caution .",
    "depending on the algorithm used to identify voids , the population of tracers ( dark matter vs. halos ) , and their number density , different results can be obtained .",
    "void profiles have been extensively studied in the recent literature . in particular , several studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) have claimed the self - similarity of the density profiles of cosmic voids in the standard @xmath7cdm model , which would make the shape of voids an ideal geometrical probe of the underlying cosmology . as mentioned before , in the context of @xmath0 gravity , recent works ( as e.g. @xcite )",
    "have shown that the extra force has the effect of evacuating faster the inner regions of cosmic voids , thereby producing steeper void profiles .",
    "a similar result is found for interacting dark energy models , even in the absence of a scale - dependent screening mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we compute the void density profiles in our set of @xmath0 simulations using two different approaches : + ( i ) stacking density profiles using void centres of each simulation + ( ii ) stacking density profiles using the centres of the gr simulation .",
    "+ the latter approach allows us to to test more precisely the effect of @xmath0 since all simulations start from the same initial conditions .",
    "therefore , by doing this one - to - one comparison , we avoid fluctuations in the profiles due to the selection of voids using vide .",
    "any deviations from the gr profiles are due to the @xmath0 gravity .    to this end",
    ", we first compute the spherically - averaged radial density profile of each individual void by estimating the cdm density within a series of logarithmically equispaced spherical shells centred in the barycentre of each void and normalised to the void effective radius @xmath135 .",
    "we perform this procedure for two distinct ranges of void size , namely @xmath140 mpc@xmath129 , considering 100 randomly selected voids in each case .",
    "then we obtain the stacked profiles by averaging the overdensity in each radial bin over the 100 individual profiles .",
    "the resulting profiles are displayed in fig .",
    "[ void_profiles ] , where we show the comparison of the stacked density profiles obtained using the cdm void catalog in standard gr and in the various realisations of @xmath0 gravity . in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ void_profiles ] the error bars represent the corrected sample standard deviation computed on the 100 randomly selected voids , while in the lower panels we show the relative difference between the models and the grey - shaded area represents the @xmath141 confidence on the relative difference based on the standard deviation of the mean density profiles computed through a _ bootstrap _ resampling technique with @xmath142 re - samples of the @xmath143 individual profiles .",
    "as the figure shows , @xmath0 voids present a systematically lower density in the inner part of the void with a significant deviation from the gr behavior .    in fig .",
    "[ void_profiles_gr ] we show the same results obtained by computing the individual spherically - averaged profiles , always assuming , i.e. for all gravity models , the void centre computed from the gr simulation .",
    "this results in a clearer hierarchy among the models in the overdensity deviation from gr that appears in the central part of the voids , with the deviation increasing for increasing values of the @xmath144 parameter .",
    "as one can see from the figure , only the @xmath145 model is found to be consistent at @xmath141 with the gr result , while the other models are both clearly distinguishable from the standard case .    to conclude this section ,",
    "the imprint of @xmath0 in the void profiles is enhanced near the centres of voids and for smaller void sizes with significant deviations from the gr case except for the weakest modification of gravity considered in the present work .",
    "\\(i ) in this paper we performed an analysis of the @xmath0 imprints on the large scale structure of the universe in the non - linear domain . we started by looking at the halo abundance measured in n - body simulations .",
    "we used the theoretical model of @xcite to fit the multiplicity function and found a good accuracy with the n - body simulations up to @xmath120 .",
    "overall we found a larger number of massive halos in @xmath0 gravity , which agrees with previous studies ( e.g. @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , unlike previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) we found the drifting diffusive barrier mass function reproduces the @xmath0 n - body simulations also in the low halo masses regime .",
    "\\(ii ) we extended the theoretical multiplicity function to the conditional one .",
    "we used monte carlo random walks to ensure the robustness of our prediction and we found a very good correspondence for different large scale perturbations at the @xmath1 level . from this prediction we derived the linear halo bias for @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the latter is fixed by the parameters of the halo mass function and in particular the linear criteria of collapse , ( stochastic barrier ) .",
    "because most of the stochastic nature of the barrier is due to the excursion set framework @xcite@xcite , our prediction of the conditional mass function can be easily extended to any theory of gravity , providing the linear spherical criteria for halos to collapse .",
    "\\(iii ) we measured the halo density profiles in the @xmath0 and gr n - body simulations .",
    "we found a deviations from gr depending on the halo masses , redshift and @xmath144 parameters .",
    "this deviation tends to decrease for massive halos at low redshift ( e.g. @xmath146 at @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear how to model the trend of these profiles considering that the amount of the deviations are not necessarily proportional to the modified gravity parameter @xmath79 . in @xcite ,",
    "the author study how the nfw profile varies with cosmology and quantify this information in an observable quantity named sparicity",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this quantity can be used to probe the @xmath0 gravity .",
    "\\(iv ) neglecting the difference between gr and @xmath0 halo profiles at fixed halo mass , we used the halo model with our predictions of the linear halo bias and halo mass function to predict non - linear clustering . for the gr case we found an agreement on the order of @xmath147 at @xmath3 and @xmath148 at @xmath120 for @xmath149 . on the other hand for the @xmath150 case",
    "the agreement between our prediction and the n - body measurement is @xmath118 at @xmath3 and only @xmath119 at @xmath120 .",
    "overall we provide a simple prediction of the non - linear power spectrum which qualitative agree with the @xmath0 simulation at @xmath3 .",
    "\\(v ) we studied the void number density detected in @xmath0 and gr simulations .",
    "we tested the effect of the bias and sampling by considering as tracers both dark matter particles and halos .",
    "we found more voids in the dark matter density field in the case of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this was already observed in previous studies and with different void finders ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "however , this effect is erased when we identified voids using halos . in this case",
    "the ratio between @xmath0 voids to gr depends on the number density and the void finder .",
    "\\(vi ) we tested the imprint of @xmath0 on the void density profiles using a standard stacking technique and a one - to - one comparison between the gr profiles and the @xmath0 cases . in all case",
    "we found that void densities are lower in @xmath0 compared to gr .",
    "this qualitatively agree with @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
