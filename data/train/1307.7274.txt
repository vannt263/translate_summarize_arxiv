    "the idea of compositeness of the nature is not new . however , in order to explore the internal structure of the matter , the high - energy colliders are necessary .",
    "that is why , for example , search of hypothetical _ excited fermions _",
    "@xmath4 has been fulfilled at all powerful colliders , such as lep  @xcite , hera  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and continues at lhc  @xcite .",
    "the excited fermions have anomalous ( magnetic moment type ) couplings with the known fermions @xmath5 and the gauge bosons ( such as gluons , photons and weak @xmath6 bosons ) @xmath7 where the parameter @xmath8 is connected to the compositeness mass scale of the new physics . due to their anomalous type of couplings they lead to a unique experimental signature for their detection .",
    "the interaction ( [ psi ] ) could be also reinterpreted from a different point of view , introducing the new _ excited bosons _",
    "@xmath9  @xcite @xmath10 instead of the fermionic ones .",
    "such type of new heavy bosons @xmath9 could also be interesting objects for experimental searches due to their different couplings to the ordinary fermions in comparison with the minimal gauge @xmath11 couplings . in this paper",
    "we are focused on the search of the excited bosons @xmath9 , rather than on the well - known @xmath12 bosons from various benchmark models .",
    "in contrast with the minimal gauge couplings , where either only left - handed or right - handed fermions participate in the interactions , the tensor currents mix both left - handed and right - handed fermions . therefore , like the higgs particles , the excited bosons carry a nonzero chiral charge and according to the symmetry of the standard model they should be introduced as the electroweak doublets @xmath13  @xcite with the internal quantum numbers identical to the standard model higgs doublet .",
    "the existence of such doublets with masses not far from the weak scale is motivated by the hierarchy problem  @xcite . the effective interaction ( [ z * ] )",
    "is induced by quantum loop corrections from a renormalizable underlying theory and represents the lowest order effective lagrangian for the excited bosons interacting with the standard model fermions .",
    "the corresponding reference model is described in @xcite .",
    "compared to other heavy bosons , interactions mediated by @xmath13 doublets are additionally suppressed in low - energy processes by powers of small ratio of the momentum transfer to the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the search of the excited bosons is especially motivated at the lhc and future colliders and at present is conducted by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "besides this , the derivative couplings lead to unique signatures for detection of such bosons at the hadron colliders .",
    "decay products of the excited bosons possess previously unexplored angular distribution , which leads to a new strategy of the resonance search and identification in dilepton  @xcite and dijet  @xcite channels .",
    "the crucial variable , which can help to differ the decay distribution from other resonances , is an absolute value of the pseudorapidity difference @xmath14 between the final fermions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] ) .",
    "decay distributions of all other resonances have the kinematic absolute maximum at @xmath15 , while the excited bosons decay distribution is zero at this point and peaks at @xmath16 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the polar angle @xmath17 for the final fermions in the resonance rest frame and a little bit contradicts to the common opinion about an expected signal from new physics at @xmath18 .    the background from the standard model drell  yan ( dy ) process contributes mainly to the central pseudorapidity region @xmath19 from the intermediate @xmath20 bosons , which have the minimal gauge couplings with quarks and leptons .",
    "the background can be suppressed up to 40% with appropriate cut @xmath21 leaving the main part of the signal intact .",
    "this allows to enhance the significance of bump search for the excited bosons in the dilepton channels  @xcite .",
    "however , for dijet final states the huge qcd background is exponentially dominated at high @xmath22 due to @xmath23-channel gluon exchanges , which possess a rutherford - like distribution @xmath24 .",
    "it is the reason atlas and  cms collaborations to apply severe cut from above @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "such low value of @xmath26 is optimal for resonance searches with nearly isotropic decay distributions , but is not optimal for the excited bosons , where the most of the signal is removed .",
    "therefore , in order to optimize signal significance for the excited bosons the corresponding cut should be elevated  @xcite even allowing more background events .    in this paper",
    "we investigate hadron collider potential for excited bosons search in the most clear ( dilepton ) channels .",
    "usually , using these channels leads to more severe constraints on resonance mass than from dijets channels .",
    "we compare our evaluations with the official atlas collaboration results at 7  tev  @xcite , and present our estimations at higher center - of - mass energies in @xmath3 collisions and different luminosities .",
    "in order to generate signal and background samples we use the calchep package  @xcite .",
    "although the package allows to perform calculations only in born ( lo ) approximation , using the same generator provides some uniformity between signal and background generation . with its batch and web - interface facilities",
    "the calchep has become user - friendly program . besides this ,",
    "high energy physics model database ( hepmdb ) system  @xcite and iridis high performance computing cluster at the university of southampton provide access to different theoretical models and fast computer nodes .",
    "the authors acknowledge the use of these facilities in the completion of this work .",
    "we have used the simplified reference model esm  @xcite for the excited bosons . the only `` down - type '' neutral @xmath9 boson interacts both with quarks and charged leptons .",
    "therefore , it can be produced at hadron colliders and can be seen in the leptonic final states in the dy process . to investigate the resonance shape in the invariant dilepton mass and other distributions for various resonance pole masses of @xmath9 bosons many signal",
    "samples should be generated . in this paper",
    "we apply a template technique  @xcite both for signal and background samples .",
    "it allows to generate only one sample both for signal and background .",
    "the necessary distributions for the fixed pole mass @xmath27 can be obtained by reweighting the corresponding samples .",
    "the signal template sample is generated without breit  wigner pole mass factor @xmath28 and with correction function @xmath29 of luminosity decreasing at higher dilepton invariant masses @xmath30 .",
    "it can be realized using calchep user function ` usrff.c ` . the latter correction ( [ f ] )",
    "is fulfilled to ensure the same relative errors in reweighted samples regardless of the resonance pole mass .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 in such a way that the resulting template distribution decreases inversely with the invariant mass , namely @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it should be flat in logarithmic invariant mass scale ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : template ] ) .",
    "since the total resonance decay width into fermions @xmath34 is proportional to the resonance mass , the dimensionless variable @xmath35 can be introduced in ( [ bw ] ) .",
    "then the total number of events and the absolute error after reweighting can be estimated in the resonance vicinity @xmath36 as @xmath37 ^ 2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is valid only for narrow resonances and infinite detector resolution . from eqs .",
    "( [ events ] ) and ( [ de ] ) it is clear that the relative error in the reweighted sample will be approximately the same for any resonance mass from the range @xmath38 $ ] and proportional to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total number of generated events in the template sample .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : template ] the _ logflat _ signal template distribution at @xmath41 tev is shown , which contains 1 mevents .",
    "the special bin size @xmath42 is selected to show the number of events , which dedicated sample for a fixed pole mass should contain in order to achieve a comparable precision with the reweighted sample from the given template ( see eq .",
    "( [ re ] ) ) . to validate this statement a comparison between distributions for dedicated sample of 2.5  tev pole mass resonance produced at @xmath41 tev containing 30 kevents and reweighted template sample",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reweight ] .    to derive the exclusion limits and the discovery potential we should compare the signal and the background . in this paper",
    "the simplest `` number counting '' approach is adopted , which is based on the comparison of the expected rate of events for the signal and the background processes . from these rates , and assuming poisson statistics , one can determine the probability that background fluctuations produce a signal - like result according to some estimator , e.g. the likelihood ratio .    for the narrow resonances the bulk of events populates the vicinity around the peak @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the relative ratio of the signal events in this region to the total events number can be estimated using eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) as @xmath44 if we assume that the background contribution is proportional to the size of the on - peak region @xmath45 , we can estimate analytically the maximum of the signal significance on @xmath46 using the formula from appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath47 which follows directly from the poisson distribution .",
    "we will use this equation for estimation of discovery potential .",
    "the corresponding curves as a function of the window size are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scl ] .",
    "the middle curve reaches maximum at @xmath48 for @xmath49 , which corresponds , for example , to resonance production with @xmath50  tev at @xmath41  tev .",
    "the upper and bottom curves correspond to 10 times bigger and lower signal to background ratios , respectively .",
    "they reach maxima at a little bit bigger and lower size windows than the middle curve , correspondingly .",
    "it is in a good agreement with the numerical calculations ( see fig .  2 from @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we will use the optimal average value @xmath51 .",
    "however , in the muon channel the experimental @xmath52 resolution increases as @xmath53 at high muon momenta .",
    "it means that at some point we can not neglect anymore the experimental resolution in comparison with resonance width , which increases linearly with resonance mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) . therefore , in this case we can not choose the optimal window due to experimental resolution and oblige to increase it allowing more background , that directly affects the discovery potential and the exclusion limits in the muon and combined channels .",
    "we are thankful to igor boyko for this remark .",
    "at present only the atlas collaboration is looking for a production of the excited @xmath9 bosons @xcite . in 2011",
    "the atlas collaboration collected 4.9 fb@xmath55 of an integrated luminosity in dielectron channel and 5.0 fb@xmath55 in dimuon channel at a center - of - mass energy of 7 tev .",
    "the 95% cl observed and the expected exclusion limits are shown in table  i @xcite .",
    "[ tab : limits7 ]    .the observed and expected 95% cl lower limits on the mass of the @xmath2 boson for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 channels separately and for their combination from @xcite .

    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:33 ] .",
    "the plots show that high energy lhc can probe around two times heavier resonance masses at the same integrated luminosities than at run  2 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the discovery potential and the exclusion limits on the excited boson search in @xmath3 collisions at the lhc for the different center - of - mass energies and different luminosities . in particular ,",
    "lhc run 2 can discover @xmath2 up to about 5.3 tev , while the high luminosity ( hl ) lhc can extend that reach to about 6.2 tev .",
    "the high energy ( he ) lhc can probe around two times heavier resonance masses at the same integrated luminosities . the field for @xmath2 search remains opened both at the hl - lhc and the he - lhc .",
