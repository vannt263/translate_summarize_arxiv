    "galaxy lensing has come a long way since the 1995 iau symposium on gravitational lensing , where it appeared on the programme in the `` emerging techniques '' session ( brainerd , blandford & smail 1996a ) . due to a great deal of work by a number of different groups , galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing has not only been detected with impressively high statistical significance , but it is also being used to place strong constraints on the nature of dark matter halos and on the bias between light and mass in the universe ( see , e.g. , fischer et al .",

    "that is , multiple deflections are expected to occur quite frequently in deep data sets and , in particular , when comparing predictions for cosmic shear from a simulation to observations of cosmic shear on small angular scales , it is important that the simulation reproduce faithfully all of the weak galaxy lenses along the line of sight . in other words ,",
    "a fair comparison between observations and theory on the scales for which galaxy  galaxy lensing is important depends crucially on the ability of simulations to follow the growth of the non  linear power spectrum accurately . even with current codes and computer architecture , this is still somewhat challenging and appropriate care must be taken ( see , e.g. , simon white s review in these proceedings ) .    the hubble deep field ( north ) and the flanking fields have been the subject of a deep redshift survey ( cohen et al .",

    "therefore , it is possible to make quite a detailed theoretical prediction for the weak galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing shear field in the region of the hdf  north and , specifically , for the probability and effects of multiple deflections due to galaxy  galaxy lensing .",
    "for simplicity , the approach of bbs in their galaxy  galaxy lensing simulations was adopted and the physical properties of the dark matter halos around the galaxies in the hdf  north and the flanking fields were scaled in terms of the characteristic properties associated with the halos of @xmath9 galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersion of an @xmath9 galaxy halo is given by @xmath10 and it was assumed that a tully  fisher or faber  jackson type of relation held for each of the galaxies",
    ". therefore , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the velocity dispersion of a halo in which a galaxy with luminosity @xmath7 resides .",
    "the density profile of the galaxy halos was taken to be @xmath13 where @xmath14 is newton s constant and @xmath15 is a characteristic halo radius .",
    "further , it was assumed that the mass  to  light ratio of a galaxy was constant independent of its luminosity and , therefore , the radii of the halos of galaxies with @xmath16 scale with the radii of the halos of @xmath17 galaxies according to : @xmath18 the total mass of the halo of an @xmath9 lens galaxy is finite and given by : @xmath19    having made these assumptions , it is then possible to make predictions for the galaxy  galaxy lensing shear field within the region of the hdf  north that would be generated by the galaxies in cohen ( 2002 ) .",
    "the lens galaxies include not only galaxies in the hdf ",
    "north , but also galaxies in the flanking fields . because some of the galaxies in the flanking fields have quite substantial masses , the weak lensing effects of these galaxies have the potential to affect the shear field inside the much smaller region of the hdf  north .",
    "therefore , the flanking field galaxies were included in all of the calculations for the weak shear field inside the hdf  north itself . also , in order to have a consistent limiting magnitude for the galaxy lenses , only those galaxies in cohen et al .",

    "north shows that the peaks in theoretical shear field correspond to the brightest galaxies in the hdf  north .",
    "this probability that a given source will have been weakly  lensed by one or more foreground galaxies is , of course , a strong function of the actual value of the shear , @xmath39 , due to a given weak lensing deflection .",
    "that is , it is much more likely for a distant galaxy to be lensed by a foreground galaxy which produces an insignificant weak shear of @xmath40 than , say , a large weak shear of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , in order to discuss the total number of weak deflections that a given source galaxy is likely to encounter , a decision has to be made as to what minimum value of @xmath39 qualifies as a `` significant '' deflection .",
    "a typical value for the net shear due to galaxy  galaxy lensing is @xmath42 ( see , e.g. , the observational papers cited in the introduction ) and this value of @xmath39 was used as a baseline for computing the number of weak lensing deflections that source galaxies had undergone . specifically , the probability that a given galaxy was lensed by @xmath43 foreground galaxies , @xmath44 , where each _ individual deflection _ gave rise to a shear of @xmath45 was computed .",
    "that is , @xmath46 is the probability that a given galaxy had been lensed by two individual foreground galaxies , each of which lensed the distant galaxy at a level that is comparable to or greater than the expected net shear due to galaxy  galaxy lensing .",
    "therefore , the results shown here are an extremely conservative estimate of the frequency of multiple deflections .    -6.7 cm    shown in fig .",
    "2 is the theoretical probability distribution function , @xmath44 , for source galaxies in the hdf  north with a given redshift , @xmath47 . the fiducial halo model and redshift distribution adopted for fig .",
    "1 were also used here .",
    "in addition , the cosmography was varied from the flat , @xmath3dominated model used in fig .  1 to include both an open ( @xmath24 , @xmath48 ) and an einstein  de sitter model for fig .  2 .",
    "from this figure , then , the probability that a source at redshift @xmath49 has been lensed at a significant level by _ two or more _ foreground galaxies is of order 60% .",
    "also , it is clear from fig .  2 that the probability of multiple deflections occurring is essentially independent of the cosmography . instead",
    ", the frequency is influenced most strongly by the number of massive lens galaxies that are close to the line of sight ( i.e. , galaxy  galaxy lensing provides information primarily about the potentials of the lens galaxies , not cosmology per se ; see also bbs ) .    at a source redshifts @xmath50",
    ", the probability of a source galaxy encountering multiple deflections of @xmath45 increases to of order 90% .",
    "therefore , in a deep data set for which the median redshift is @xmath51 , it should be expected that multiple weak deflections of a substantial magnitude are very likely to have occurred . of course ,",
    "in the case of individual deflections for which @xmath52 , the probability of comparable multiple deflections occurring at any given source redshift will be greater than the results shown in fig .  2 .",
    "while the occurrence of multiple deflections is largely independent of the cosmology , it is certainly not independent of the details of the halo parameters . in figs .  1 and 2 a fiducial @xmath9 galaxy halo with @xmath26  km / s and @xmath53  kpc was adopted .",
    "however , galaxy  galaxy lensing constraints on the characteristic velocity dispersion of the lens galaxies range from @xmath54  km / s ( e.g. , mckay et al .  2001 ; hoekstra , yee , & gladders 2004 ) to @xmath55  km / s ( e.g. , kleinheinrich et al .",
    "constraints on the characteristic scale radius are few , and based on the galaxy  galaxy lensing observations of hoekstra , yee , & gladders ( 2004 ) , the halos of @xmath9 galaxies may be as large as @xmath56  kpc .    in this section , then , the effects of varying the halo parameters on the occurrence of multiple deflections is investigated .",
    "since the occurrence of multiple deflections is only weakly dependent on the cosmography , for the remainder of this paper only the flat , @xmath3dominated model was used .",
    "again , all source galaxies were assumed to have magnitudes in the range @xmath22 , with redshifts determined by eqns .  (",
    "2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) above .",
    "the halo parameters of the lens galaxies in the hdf  north and flanking fields were then varied as follows : @xmath57  km / s , 150  km / s , and 165  km / s ; @xmath58  kpc , @xmath59  kpc , and @xmath60  kpc .",
    "-5.7 cm    shown in fig .",
    "3 is @xmath44 for all source galaxies in the hdf  north with @xmath61 . like fig .  2 , the minimum value for a `` deflection '' to be counted in this figure is @xmath62 . unlike fig .  2 ,",
    "however , @xmath44 has been computed over the entire redshift distribution of the sources . from this figure , then , the probability that a given source in the hdf ",
    "north has been lensed more than once is 27% for the lowest mass @xmath9 halo ( upper left panel ) , 53% for the fiducial halo of figs .  1 and 2 ( center panel ) , and 69% for the highest mass @xmath9 halo ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the mass adopted for the halo of an @xmath9 galaxy has a rather substantial effect on the number of multiple deflections that occur in a galaxy  galaxy lensing calculation .",
    "-5.7 cm    since the halos are roughly isothermal and , therefore , the shear decreases with projected radius approximately as @xmath63 , it is interesting to ask whether the closest lens to a given source ( in projection on the sky ) is necessarily the strongest lens .",
    "that is , for a source that undergoes multiple deflections , is the strongest deflection most likely to come from the nearest lens on the sky ?",
    "the answer to this question is `` no , '' and is shown clearly by fig .",
    "4 . in the case of sources",
    "for which the net shear ( i.e. , the total shear after all weak deflections have occurred ) is @xmath2 , more than 50% of the time the strongest lens is not the closest lens on the sky .",
    "note that this result is essentially independent of the characteristic halo parameters that were chosen , which is consistent with the fact that , by and large , it is only the most massive galaxies that contribute substantially to the overall galaxy  galaxy lensing signal .",
    "5 and 6 demonstrate a result that is perhaps somewhat counter  intuitive : multiple weak lensing deflections , on average , give rise to a greater net shear on the source galaxies and a greater mean tangential shear about the lens centers .",
    "that is , multiple deflections do not simply cancel one another out , leading to little or no net shear on the source galaxies .",
    "5 shows probabilities for the distribution of the ratio of the maximum value of any given single deflection , @xmath64 , to that of the net shear , @xmath65 , for all sources with @xmath22 that underwent more than one deflection of any magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line shows the median value of the distribution , and for all halo models the median is less than 1 .",
    "that is , more than 50% of the time , the net shear on a given source is greater than the maximum single deflection that it underwent .",
    "-5.7 cm    fig .",
    "6 shows the mean tangential shear , computed about the lens centers in the hdf  north .",
    "squares show the results of the proper inclusion of multiple deflections for all sources , and crosses show the result of lensing each source solely by the closest lens on the sky ( i.e. , a `` single deflection '' calculation ) . in all cases ,",
    "the inclusion of multiple deflections gives rise to a larger mean tangential shear on scales @xmath67 , and in the case of the more massive halos , the increase in the shear is quite substantial .",
    "this figure , then emphasizes the need for a correct , multiple deflection calculation when using observations of the mean tangential shear to constrain the halo properties of the lens galaxies ( i.e. , the comparison of single deflection calculations to observations leads to an inferred halo mass for @xmath9 galaxies that is too large ) .    -5.7",
    "in addition to giving rise to a generally larger net shear on source galaxies and a larger mean tangential shear about the lens centers , multiple deflections in galaxy  galaxy lensing give rise to correlated ellipticities in the images of the galaxies .",
    "this is , of course , precisely the effect of cosmic shear , but in the case of galaxy  galaxy lensing , this is merely the very small @xmath68 end of the power spectrum ( i.e. , the highly non  linear regime ) that is contributing to the total cosmic shear signal ( i.e. , when computed over all structures along the line of sight ) .    -5.7",
    "cm    the degree to which multiple deflections give rise to correlated image ellipticities and , hence , contribute to the cosmic shear signal is a strong function of the mass adopted for the halo of an @xmath9 galaxy .",
    "this is shown in fig .  7 , where the shear correlation function , @xmath69 is shown as a function of the halo parameters .",
    "the mean value is computed for all foreground ",
    "background pairs of galaxies separated by angles @xmath70 on the sky ( see , e.g. , blandford et al .",
    "1991 ) . here",
    "@xmath71 is the image shape of galaxy @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the complex conjugate of the image shape of galaxy @xmath74 .",
    "the image shape is defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the major and minor axes of the image equivalent ellipse and @xmath78 is its position angle . as in fig .",
    "6 , squares show the results of the full multiple deflection calculations and crosses show the results of calculations in which each source was lensed solely by the closest lens on the sky . from this figure , then , the single deflection calculations do not give rise to correlated image ellipticities on scales @xmath79 ( on smaller scales , of course , the images of distant sources that have been lensed by the identical foreground galaxy will be correlated because of the tangential alignment about the lens center ) . in the multiple deflection calculations , however , sufficiently massive halos give rise to correlated ellipticities that persist to significantly large angles , just due to the galaxy  galaxy lensing signal alone .",
    "oftentimes the phrase `` cosmic shear '' is interpreted to mean `` lensing by large ",
    "scale structure '' , and this is true on large angular scales where it is only structure in the linear regime that is responsible for the gravitational lensing . properly , however , cosmic shear is the lensing of distant galaxies by _ all _ the mass along the line of sight , including highly non  linear structures .",
    "this is why , on small angular scales , it is necessary to use large simulations ( e.g. , jain , seljak , & white 2000 ; valageas , barber , & munshi 2004 ; vale & white 2003 ) to make accurate theoretical predictions of cosmic shear .    from fig .  7 , it is clear that , depending upon the characteristic mass of the halos of @xmath9 galaxies , galaxy  galaxy lensing will contribute to the cosmic shear signal as measured , for example , via the top hat shear variance , @xmath80 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here @xmath81 is the power spectrum of the projected mass density of the universe , @xmath82 is a bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath83 is the size of the aperture over which the mean is computed . in an observational data",
    "set , the function is computed as @xmath84 for all galaxies within an aperture of size @xmath83 on the sky ( see , e.g. , hmmerle et al .",
    "the above published predictions for @xmath85 in cdm models have been based on simulations in which the mass and force resolution were not quite adequate to resolve the halos of @xmath9 galaxies particularly well and , so , it is difficult to be certain how accurate the theoretical predictions truly are on very small angular scales .",
    "-6.5 cm    the symbols in fig .",
    "8 show the r.m.s .  cosmic shear , @xmath86 , computed within circular apertures of radius @xmath83 in the full multiple deflection calculations of galaxy  galaxy lensing in the hdf  north .",
    "that is , the symbols in this figure show the r.m.s.cosmic shear _ due to galaxies alone _ , without any contribution from linear or quasi ",
    "linear structures along the line of sight . from bottom to top , the point types correspond to increasing the halo mass from a minimum mass of @xmath87 ( open diamonds ) to a maximum mass of @xmath88 ( four  pointed stars ) .",
    "the mass of the fiducial halo with @xmath26  km / s and @xmath27  kpc is @xmath89 , and the r.m.s .  cosmic shear in this case",
    "is shown by the solid squares .",
    "also shown is the prediction for @xmath86 for @xmath3cdm and open cdm from the simulations of jain , seljak , & white ( 2000 ) for a source galaxy population with median redshift of @xmath90 ( i.e. , similar to the hdf  north raytracing simulations for sources with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath3cdm and ocdm predictions do not extend below @xmath91 .    the filled circles and filled triangles show the r.m.s.cosmic shear produced by galaxy  galaxy lensing alone for cases in which the mass of the halo of an @xmath9 galaxy is @xmath92% less than the fiducial halo mass and @xmath92% greater than the fiducial halo mass , respectively . at @xmath93 ,",
    "then , a change in the fiducial halo mass of only 20% results in a change in the predicted cosmic shear signal that is quite comparable to the predicted differences between two rather different cosmological models .",
    "in other words , if one wishes to use observations of cosmic shear on small angular scales to constrain the cosmography ( through , e.g. , a comparison to ray  tracing simulations ) it is vital that the simulations have followed the formation of the growth of non  linear structures very accurately .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "cosmic shear due solely to galaxy  galaxy lensing extrapolates to zero at @xmath94 for the fiducial halo model with @xmath95  km / s and @xmath27  kpc .",
    "it is , therefore , only on scales @xmath96 that contributions of galaxy  galaxy lensing to the cosmic shear signal are likely to be of importance .",

    "north , given a particular cosmography and a model for the halos of the lens galaxies .",
    "the primary conclusions from this work are :    * multiple weak deflections are commonplace in such deep data sets , and the proper inclusion of multiple deflections is important to a correct prediction for the net shear experienced by the majority of source galaxies . * for a given source redshift , the probability of multiple weak deflections is largely insensitive to the cosmography ( i.e. , galaxy  galaxy lensing is much more sensitive to the details of the gravitational potentials of the lens galaxy halos than it is to the values of the cosmological parameters ) . * compared to a single deflection calculation in which sources are lensed solely by the nearest lens on the sky , a full multiple deflection calculation leads both to a larger net shear for most individual sources and a larger tangential shear about the lens centers . *",
    "multiple weak deflections give rise to correlated image ellipticities ( i.e. , `` cosmic shear '' due to power on highly non  linear scales ) .",
    "* on angular scales @xmath97 , galaxy  galaxy lensing alone accounts for a substantial amount of the cosmic shear signal expected in @xmath3cdm and open cdm models .",
    "the magnitude of the signal is , however , very sensitive to the characteristic halo mass and , hence , accurate comparisons of observations of cosmic shear and theory on such scales rely heavily on the ability of simulations to follow the growth of the non  linear power spectrum with high accuracy .",
