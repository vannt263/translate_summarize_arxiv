    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems have been a fertile source of interesting physics over the past few decades , playing host to the fractional and integer quantum hall effects and cuprate superconductivity among other phenomena .",
    "the most widely studied and most thoroughly understood 2d electron systems are those that occur near semiconductor heterojunctions . in these systems",
    "carrier densities and disorder strengths can be adjusted using modulation doping and the electric field effect , and high sample quality can be achieved using lattice matched materials and epitaxial growth techniques .",
    "these 2d systems are well described by fermi liquid theory , at least at magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "rapid recent progress in the epitaxial growth of complex transition - metal oxides@xcite foreshadows the birth of an entirely new class of 2d electron systems , one in which electronic correlations are strong even at @xmath0 and non - fermi - liquid behavior is common .",
    "the present authors have recently argued@xcite that the modulation doping technique commonly used in semiconductor heterojunction systems can also be applied to complex - oxide heterojunctions to create high - quality two - dimensional strongly - correlated electron systems ( 2dscess ) localized near the interface between two different mott insulators .",
    "our study was based on a generalized hubbard model which captures some key features of these systems , and on combined insights achieved by applying hartree - fock theory ( hft ) , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and thomas - fermi theory ( tft ) approaches .",
    "this theoretical strategy echoed that adopted by okamoto and millis@xcite in addressing the two - dimensional electron systems which can occur near the interface between a mott insulator and a band insulator . in both cases",
    "the properties of the 2d electron systems reflect a delicate balance between space - charge electric fields and strong local correlations .",
    "these 2d systems are clearly unusual in many respects .",
    "for instance , their quasiparticles interact with the 3d spin - excitations of the mott insulator barrier materials .",
    "since researchers now appear to be at the cusp of achieving experimental control over this kind of 2d electron system , it is interesting to explore the possibilities theoretically in an attempt to find useful theoretical frameworks , and hopefully also to partially anticipate some of the new phenomena likely to occur .",
    "to mention one example , it has recently been suggested that a spin - liquid insulator could be found in a mott insulators bilayer@xcite system with an appropriate doping profile .",
    "the apparent electronic interface reconstruction ( eir ) discovered@xcite at the heterojunction between the band insulators laalo@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1 is unique in complex oxide interface studies and does not have an analog in semiconductor heterojunction systems , although there is still some uncertainty about the role of oxygen vacancies in the measured conductivity .",
    "for example , it has been proposed @xcite that the oxygen vacancies are responsible for the insulating behavior observed at the @xmath2-type interface .",
    "the reconstruction is forced by the polarity difference between laalo@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1 .",
    "polarity discontinuities are normally weaker at semiconductor heterojunctions and , when present , the electric fields to which they give rise are usually screened by relaxation of atoms near the interface@xcite . in complex transition metal oxides , however , it was discovered@xcite that the polarity discontinuity field can be screened electronically by transferring electrons between surface and interface layers , changing the valence of transition metal ions in these layers .",
    "electrons dodge the _",
    "polar catastrophe_@xcite without essential atomic assistance .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that such an interface can be tuned between metallic and insulating states by relatively modest electric fields , suggesting the possibility of novel electronic devices .    in this paper",
    "we examine eir at a heterostructure between model polar and nonpolar mott insulators .",
    "we have in mind for these effects mott insulators with cubic peroskite structures .",
    "possible materials combinations are discussed in section vi .",
    "the long - ranged coulombic space - charge fields are treated within the hartree approximation , and strong on - site coulomb interactions are treated by solving hft , dmft , and tft equations .",
    "we find that a minimum number of polar layers is required to induce an eir because of strong local correlations , whereas the number of nonpolar layers does not play an essential role in determining the electron distribution .",
    "we also find that when a 2d electron system is present near the heterojunction , it is strongly localized because of strong correlations which limit the potential of the electronic system to lower its energy by spreading out in the growth direction .",
    "tft results provide a simple way of understanding the more microscopic dmft and hft calculations and are remarkably accurate .",

    "( @xmath55 and @xmath56.)@xcite for both afm and fm states eir occurs only for the model thin film with the larger value of @xmath3 .",
    "this feature is a result of the competition between the polar catastrophe@xcite and strong local correlations .",
    "although the polarity discontinuity at the interface favors a transfer of electrons from the outmost surface to the interface , this charge rearrangement is opposed by the mott - hubbard gap .",

    "an analogous competition has already been discussed and studied experimentally in laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1 heterostructures @xcite . in that case",
    "the energy which competes with the polar catastrophe is the energy difference between the top of oxygen @xmath2-bands in nonpolar srtio@xmath1 and the bottom of aluminum @xmath22 bands in laalo@xmath1 , instead of the correlation gap in the example studied here . since it always costs the gap energy to add more electrons on any layer of the heterostructure , electrons accumulate initially near the interface to gain the most electrostatic energy , eventually spreading out through the heterostructure to minimize kinetic energy cost .",
    "quantum confinement of the 2dsces associated with eir is stronger for states with stronger on - site correlations because the kinetic energy is then a smaller component of the overall energy budget .",
    "this is the reason that in fig .",
    "[ fig : two](b ) electrons are more confined to the interface in the afm state than in the fm state . ( the fm state has larger bandwidths and smaller correlation gaps , at least within hft . )",

    "the @xmath59 thin film has 20 two - fold spin - degenerate 2d bands because of the reduced translational symmetry of the afm state , and charge neutrality requires that 10 bands be occupied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : five](a ) we can identify 10 relatively widely spaced bands which correspond at high energies to the upper hubbard band and at low energies to the lower hubbard band in the polar material .",
    "the bands are widely spaced because of the average electric field in the polar material ; for the same reason these bands are quite highly localized in individual atomic layers .",
    "the two groups of more narrowly spaced bands correspond respectively to the upper hubbard band and the lower hubbard band of the non - polar material . because the space - charge electric fields are much either almost fully or at least partially screened out in the non - polar material by charge accumulation at the interface , the bands are closely spaced and the corresponding eigenstates contain more inter - layer characters . when eir occurs there is a weakly avoided anticrossing between the top - most lower hubbard band state in the polar material and the upper hubbard band states of the non - polar material .",

    "layered oxide materials have a natural thomas - fermi approximation in which the total energy is expressed as the sum of the total electrostatic energy and a local - density - approximation for the band and correlation energies . for layered structures",
    "the contribution to the energy from each atomic layer is approximated by the energy per layer of an electrically neutral 3d system with the average site occupancy of that layer . minimizing this energy with a fixed total density constraint leads to the following tf equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 for this case is .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 is the overall chemical potential .",
    "following the same approach described in ref@xcite , we can solve the tf equations for different ordered states using @xmath79 calculated from hf solutions for the three - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "we confirmed that tft very accurately reproduces the results of hft for the charge distribution between the layers , as in the case of modulation doping@xcite .",
    "one advantage of using this tf equation is that we can derive some key properties analytically .",
    "for example , if we assume that the d - orbitals of polar and non - polar sides are both described by one - band hubbard models and that the charge transfer occurs from a single surface layer to a single interface layer eq.([eq : tf ] ) reduces to @xmath80 where the hubbard model chemical potentials are expressed as function of density in units of electrons per atom , @xmath81 is the charge transfer , and the on - site energies which are usually set to zero in hubbard models , restored on each side of the heterojunction .",
    "since the left hand side is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath81 and the right hand side is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath81 , this equation has a solution and eir will occur if @xmath82 - [ \\epsilon_{d1 } + \\mu_p(1- ) ] = e_{ig }   \\label{nmp}\\ ] ] i.e. if the electric potential drop across the polar layer exceeds the spatially indirect gap @xmath83 between the bottom of the upper hubbard band in the non - polar material and the top of the lower hubbard band in the polar material .",
    "since the variation of chemical potential with density is strongly reduced outside of the gap in strongly correlated material , it follows that the amount of charge transfered once @xmath84 exceeds the minimum value is given accurately by @xmath85 as the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : deltan ] becomes comparable to 0.5 at larger values of @xmath86 , the fundamental assumption of our simple model ( namely that the polar catastrophe is avoided by electronic rather than atomic reconstruction ) becomes increasingly suspect .",

    "these additional features related to the @xmath89 orbital degree of freedom may bring in new physics which can not be explored in our single - band thin film model .",

    "<S> we report on a theoretical study of the electronic interface reconstruction ( eir ) induced by polarity discontinuity at a heterojunction between a polar and a nonpolar mott insulators , and of the two - dimensional strongly - correlated electron systems ( 2dscess ) which accompany the reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an expression for the minimum number of polar layers required to drive the eir , and discuss key parameters of the heterojunction system which control 2dsces properties . </S>",
    "<S> the role of strong correlations in enhancing confinement at the interface is emphasized . </S>"
