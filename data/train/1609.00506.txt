    "on may 22 , 2016 the austrians voted in a runoff election between norbert hofer ( candidate 1 ) and alexander van der bellen ( candidate 2 ) . the result after counting the votes was 49.7  :  50.3 in favor of van der bellen .",
    "for the precise data we refer to @xcite .",
    "the party supporting the candidate norbert hofer subsequently appealed to the austrian constitutional court , claiming irregularities in the procedure of counting the mail votes .    here",
    "are the details . in austria",
    "there are two ways of casting one s vote . either by showing up personally at the poll site and delivering the vote into the ballot box ( ballot voting ) , or by sending the vote by mail during a well - defined period preceding the voting day ( mail voting ) .",
    "the allegation of hofer s party was that in some districts the counting of the mail votes violated the procedure stipulated by the law .",
    "for example , the letters of the outer envelopes containing these votes ( in an inner envelope ) should not be opened before 9:00  a.m.  of the subsequent monday , may 23 .",
    "the reason is that the electoral board for the mail votes for districts only is called on duty for this time . by opening these letters prematurely",
    "these votes became invalid was argued by the alleging party .",
    "several other accusations were made , involving different degrees of severity @xcite .",
    "the constitutional court carefully investigated these accusations and concluded that in 11 of the 117 voting districts there have indeed happened violations of the law during the procedure of counting the mail votes .",
    "the court sentenced that in total there were 77.769 mail votes counted in an irregular way .",
    "the central argument of the court in favor of ordering a repetition of the election was that there was the _",
    "possibility _ that manipulations on such a number of votes might have led to a reversal of the result .",
    "after all , the margin was only 30.863 votes .",
    "on the other hand , the constitutional court states explicitly in its findings that there was no evidence that there actually have been any manipulations of the votes .",
    "what has been proved were several violations of the legally prescribed procedure of counting the votes .",
    "our goal is to obtain a quantitative analysis of the probability that there was in reality a victory of norbert hofer and was only turned afterwards  in whatever way  into a victory of alexander van der bellen because of wrong - counting the mail votes in the incriminated 11 districts .    to do so , we first compare the results in the @xmath0 `` green '' or `` uncontaminated '' districts where the court did not find violations of the legal procedures , with the @xmath1 `` red '' or `` contaminated '' districts districts where the court found violations of these procedures .",
    "each `` green '' district corresponds to a green dot : on the x - axis we plot the percentage of votes for candidate 1 ( norbert hofer ) among the ballot votes , and on the y - axis the percentage of the votes for candidate 1 among the votes by mail .",
    "the picture clearly indicates a linear relation between these two ratios .",
    "one also sees that the slope of the regression line is smaller than 1 which does not come as a surprise . among the voters of norbert hofer the propensity to use the possibility of voting by mail is smaller than among the voters of alexander van der bellen .",
    "we can also observe that the intercept of the regression line essentially vanishes , i.e. the regression line essentially passes through the origin .",
    "while the green dots correspond to the `` uncontaminated '' districts , the red dots in figure [ figure : diag1 ] correspond to the 11 `` contaminated '' ones .",
    "glancing at figure [ figure : diag1 ] one can not see any alarming behavior of the red dots .",
    "the above figure [ figure : diag1 ] corresponds to the _ counted _ votes . in the subsequent analysis",
    "we shall only accept the green dots as valid data . as regards the red dots ,",
    "we only take their x - coordinate as granted : recall that the x - coordinate corresponds to the percentage of ballot votes in favor of candidate 1 . as regards the y - coordinates of the red dots ,",
    "it is precisely our point to analyze whether the _ true _ votes gave different results than the _ counted _ votes in a degree which could have resulted in a reversal of the election result .    as an illustration , figure [ figure : diag2 ] below indicates a scenario for the _ true _ votes which would have yielded a victory for candidate 1 ( by a margin of 1 vote ) . to obtain figure [ figure : diag2 ] , we have assigned  hypothetically  15.432 ( half the missing 30.863 votes , rounded up ) proportionally to the 11 `` contaminated '' districts , and subsequently recalculated the corresponding percentages .",
    "this procedure implements a scenario where that many votes have wrongly been counted for candidate 2 instead of candidate 1 . for more detailed information",
    "we refer to the web site of the first named author @xcite ( http://www.wahlanalyse.com/wahlkartendifferenzenvfgh.html [ http://www.wahlanalyse.com/wahlkartendifferenzenvfgh.html ] ) .",
    "it is evident that a scenario as in diagram 2 does not look very likely to have happened in reality .",
    "this diagram only has an illustrative character for our purposes in order to visualize the absurdity of such a scenario .",
    "it will not play any role in the subsequent analysis .",
    "in particular , we shall not assume a certain given assignment of the missing 30.863 votes to the 11 red districts .",
    "we shall only be interested in their _",
    "total sum_. speaking mathematically , we shall eventually calculate the probability distribution of the total number of _ true _ mail votes in the incriminated districts , conditionally on the given results of the `` green '' districts , and calculate the probability of the event that they would have resulted in a victory of candidate 1 .    to analyze the probability that the _ true _",
    "votes by mail in the red districts would have yielded a victory for candidate 1 , we apply a weighted linear regression model to the green dots in diagram 1 .",
    "in fact , since the calculations become easier to write and to program , we use a regression model on the number of votes instead of the percentages , which is mathematically equivalent . since the expected variation of the votes depends on the total number of votes in the respective districts , the model exhibits heteroskedascity , and we have to use a weighted regression .",
    "regression models include prediction intervals for observations with known values for the independent variable(s ) and known standard deviations ( compared to standard deviations of completely known cases ) . using these procedures and assuming that the mail vote results in the contaminated districts follow the model of the uncontaminated districts",
    ", we can then compute the distribution of the sum of the expected votes in the contaminated 11 districts ( which , under the present model assumptions , follows a rescaled @xmath2-distribution ) .    using the distribution of this random variable",
    ", we can then calculate the probability that the _ true votes _ would have resulted in an election of candidate 1 . as we shall see below",
    ", the numerical value equals @xmath3 .",
    "actually , it turns out that the sentence of the constitutional court may also lead to a slightly different calculation .",
    "apart from the 11 `` contaminated '' districts it identified 3 more `` dubious '' districts where things are not so clear .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details .",
    "although the sentence of the court did not take into account these districts , one might argue that  possibly  also in these districts the counting of the mail votes was not reliable .",
    "mathematically speaking , this leads to the consideration of m = 14 `` red '' and n = 117 -14 = 103 `` green '' districts .",
    "the calculations then are identical to the above considered case and lead to a numerical value of @xmath4 .",
    "we consider @xmath5 voting districts with a total of @xmath6 valid votes for @xmath7 in district @xmath8 there were @xmath9 votes counted for candidate 1 and @xmath10 votes for candidate 2 , so that @xmath11 .    the votes @xmath6 split into @xmath12 many ballot votes and @xmath13 many mail votes which again are divided into @xmath14 many votes for candidate 1 and @xmath15 many votes for candidate 2 .",
    "our objects of interest are the vote numbers    @xmath16    these numbers denote the votes for candidate 1 among the ballot and mail votes respectively .",
    "as indicated by the diagrams above , a linear relation between these quantities is justified as model assumption . to make the plots easier to understand , we used percentages instead of votes there .",
    "while the numbers @xmath17 are considered as given data the numbers @xmath18 are considered as realizations of the following random variables : @xmath19    here @xmath20 is an unknown deterministic number while @xmath21 are independent centered gaussian random variables .",
    "their variance is @xmath22 , for some ( unknown ) deterministic number @xmath23    variances of votes for parties being proportional to the number of total votes is a standard model assumption in statistical voting analysis procedures ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we are thus facing a heteroskedastic , linear regression model .    applying standard regression theory",
    ", we obtain the estimators @xmath24 which we consider as random variables .",
    "in particular , the estimator @xmath25 follows a ( rescaled ) @xmath2-distribution whose parameters can be explicitly calculated for the given data .",
    "we next consider @xmath26 many `` contaminated '' districts , disjoint from the @xmath27 `` uncontaminated '' districts .    assuming that the results @xmath28 also follow model [ m1 ] ,",
    "they can be considered as random variables @xmath29    as we do not know the true value of @xmath20 we have to consider the estimated variable @xmath30 the new noise variables @xmath31 are such that @xmath32 are independent .",
    "the variance of the @xmath33 again is given by @xmath34    finally we consider the sum @xmath35 @xmath36 is the random variable modeling the total mail votes for candidate 1 in the @xmath37 `` contaminated '' districts .",
    "denoting by @xmath38 the total number of ballot votes of candidate 1 in the @xmath37 `` contaminated '' districts , and by @xmath39 the total number of mail votes in these districts , we may write @xmath36 as    @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a centered gaussian variable with variance @xmath42 .    a standard tool of regression theory allows us to compute a prediction interval for @xmath43    if @xmath44 were known , @xmath45 were normally distributed with mean @xmath46 and variance @xmath47    applying this fact we use the regression model estimate for @xmath48 as substitute for the unknown constant @xmath49 . using this , the random variable",
    "@xmath50 follows a @xmath2-distribution with 105 degrees of freedom .",
    "we compare this random variable with the critical number @xmath51 which would be necessary for candidate 1 in order to reverse the result .",
    "finally we compute @xmath52\\ ] ] which can be computed explicitly and yields the desired result .",
    "we use results for the standard heteroskedastic linear model    @xmath53 with covariance matrix @xmath54 for a given positive definite matrix @xmath55    in this model , the best linear unbiased estimator for @xmath56 is @xmath57    the covariance of this estimator is    @xmath58    in our case , @xmath59 is the @xmath27x@xmath60-matrix @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the diagonal matrix @xmath63 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 in our case is the scalar @xmath20 and its estimator is @xmath25 , and @xmath64 becomes @xmath65    therefore @xmath66 and @xmath67    we want to compute the distribution of @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we have @xmath71    since @xmath44 is unknown , we have to replace it by the estimator @xmath72 and then @xmath73 follows a @xmath2-distribution with @xmath74 degrees of freedom . from that confidence intervals for @xmath36",
