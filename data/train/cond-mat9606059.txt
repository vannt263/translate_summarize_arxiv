    "a neutral , isolated fullerene molecule is an eminently stable and symmetrical system .",
    "the fullerene ions ( either negative or positive ) along with the electronically excited neutral molecule , particularly the long - lived triplet exciton , undergo instead jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions .",
    "the negative ion and the triplet exciton , respectively with @xmath3 and @xmath4 symmetry , will distort according to a linear combination of the eight @xmath5 molecular modes .",
    "the jt distortion of the positive ion , with @xmath6 symmetry , involves also the six @xmath7 modes in addition to the eight @xmath5 ones .",
    "although accurate numerical values of all couplings are not yet available in all cases , the static jt energy gains are believed to be roughly in the order of 0.1ev .",
    "this value is comparable with the typical vibrational frequency , and the coupling is generally of intermediate strength .",
    "several descriptions of the static jt effect in fullerene ions can be found in the literature.@xcite    as pointed out more recently , however , a static jt description , where the pseudorotational motion of the carbon nuclei is treated classically , and then quantized separately in the born - oppenheimer approximation is , at least in the isolated molecule , and at zero temperature fundamentally inadequate . in other words ,",
    "the fullerene ions are expected to be genuine _ dynamical _ jahn - teller ( djt ) systems , where different but equivalent distorted configurations , ( forming the usual static jt manifold@xcite ) , are not independent of one another , but are in fact connected by nonzero transition amplitudes@xcite .",
    "this in turn requires giving up born - oppenheimer , and fully quantizing electronic and ionic motions together , which is the essence of djt .",
    "the physical understanding of djt in c@xmath8 ions is greatly eased by initially assuming the strong - coupling limit . in this limit",
    ", as it turns out , a _ modified _ born - oppenheimer approximation can again be recovered , provided a suitable gauge field , reflecting the electronic _",
    "berry phase_,@xcite is added to the nuclear motion .",
    "this situation , discussed originally for the triatomic molecule,@xcite and subsequently for other jt systems@xcite has been recently the object of a close scrutiny in fullerene , especially in the negative ions@xcite and , to a lesser degree , in the positive ion.@xcite it is found in particular that , if treated in the strong - coupling limit , the odd - charged fullerene ions , in particular the singly - charged c@xmath1@xcite and c@xmath9 , @xcite , the hund s rule _",
    "_ ground state of doubly charged c@xmath10 , as well as the neutral @xmath4 triplet exciton,@xcite , must possess this kind of berry phase .",
    "by contrast , the berry phases cancel out in the _ singlet _ configuration of even - charged ions , such as c@xmath10 , and c@xmath11 .",
    "although , as stated above , the true electron - vibron coupling in c@xmath8 is in reality only of intermediate strength , the presence or absence of a berry phase in the strong - coupling limit djt implies a number of physical consequences , which persist at realistic couplings , and whose importance has been discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "properties affected include basic ground - state features such as symmetry@xcite and energy,@xcite spectral features ( including characteristic splittings of the lowest vibron excitations with skipping of even angular momenta@xcite ) , scattering anomalies such as suppression of ordinary s - wave attachment of low - energy electrons,@xcite and the prediction of orbitally - related electron pairing phenomena in idealized molecular metal lattices with weak electron hopping between molecules.@xcite    for these and other reasons it seems important to understand completely and quantitatively the djt effect of single fullerene ions , experimentally as well as theoretically . to this date , however , and in spite of a large amount of data collected on fullerene and especially on fulleride systems , there is still frustratingly little _",
    "direct _ evidence that the jt effect in fullerene ions is , to start with , really dynamical , as theory predicts .    in the solid state , for example ,",
    "raman data on metallic fullerides such as k@xmath12c@xmath8@xcite fail to show the characteristic vibron splittings expected for the isolated c@xmath13 ions.@xcite this probably means that in true metallic fullerides the molecular jt effect may be profoundly affected and modified by the large crystal fields , as well as by the strong , rather than weak , intermolecular electron hopping .",
    "even in nonmetallic fullerides like k@xmath14c@xmath8 , where the insulating behavior is almost certainly due to a molecular jt effect,@xcite it is presently not at all clear whether the quantum dynamical features are present or suppressed .",
    "fullerene ions have also been widely studied in solutions@xcite and in solid ionic salts@xcite but again no specific djt signature has been pinpointed , so far .    the main target remains therefore _ gas - phase fullerene _ : the djt signatures should be unmistakable in ions of either sign , and in triplet - excited neutral molecules , particularly if in the future raman excitations could be studied.@xcite what is available so far are essentially only gas - phase photoemission spectra of c@xmath1,@xcite and of c@xmath8.@xcite encouragingly , the former are fit very well indeed by a djt theory.@xcite nonetheless , this can only be considered as indirect evidence .",
    "the positive ions results have not yet been analyzed , although the appropriate djt theory has been formulated.@xcite    we therefore wish to consider here other properties of the fullerene ions , among those crucially affected by the djt effect , which could at least in principle be accessed either in gas - phase , or in ideally inert matrices , or in suitable salts with especially small crystal - field effects .",
    "one such quantity is precisely the molecular magnetic moment .",
    "the magnetic moment of a _ static _",
    "jt molecule is strictly the spin moment .",
    "the orbital degeneracy is removed , so long as static - jt energies are , as in the case of c@xmath8 , sufficiently large .",
    "the magnetic moment in a _",
    "dynamic_-jt molecule , conversely , is a compound of spin and orbital moments , since here the quantum effects fully restore the original orbital symmetry.@xcite the calculation of the magnetic moment and effective @xmath0-factor of fullerene ions in their djt ground state is precisely the subject of this work .",
    "let us consider for a start the orbital magnetic moment of a molecule .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the proportionality factor between magnetic moment and the mechanical angular momentum can be thought as some _ effective _ bohr magneton @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the orbiting electron ( @xmath17 is the electron charge and s.i .",
    "units are used throughout ) . in an atom , @xmath18 , the free electron mass . in a djt molecule",
    ", however , orbital electron motion involves nuclear motion as well , since electronic and vibrational modes are entangled .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath19 , with a corresponding reduction of the orbital magnetic moment . this is a classic example of the so - called `` ham reduction factor'',@xcite well - known in djt systems.@xcite the consequence of orbital reduction is that , while the quantum of mechanical angular momentum is of course universal and equal to @xmath20 , that of the magnetic moment for a djt molecule is _ not universal_.    below , we will calculate quantitatively the orbital magnetic moment for c@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , since the orbital moment is not easily accessible experimentally , while the total magnetic moment is commonly measured , spin - orbit coupling will have to be introduced , to determine the correct composition of the ( djt - reduced ) orbital moment , and of the spin moment .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling within the @xmath3 orbital of c@xmath8 is quantitatively unknown . here",
    "we calculate it , and find some surprises .",
    "first , the calculated molecular spin - orbit splitting is very small , roughly one hundredth than in the bare carbon atom .",
    "this is related to the larger radius of curvature of the molecular orbit .",
    "second , this reduced spin - orbit splitting is now wholly comparable to typical zeeman energies , for instance , in x - band epr at 0.339 t .",
    "hence , a field dependence of the low - temperature susceptibility and of apparent @xmath0-factors is predicted , at least in an idealized gas - phase epr experiment .",
    "third , we find that the orbital gyromagnetic factor is strongly reduced by vibron coupling , and so therefore are the effective weak - field @xmath0-factors for all the low - lying states .",
    "the ground state @xmath0-factor , in particular , is predicted to be slightly _ negative _ , about -0.1 .",
    "the basic model hamiltonian we consider has the following standard structure : @xmath21 the jt part @xmath22 has been introduced and discussed in previous papers.@xcite we report here the basic version for the coupling to a single @xmath5 vibrational ( quadrupolar ) mode : @xmath23 c_{m_1,\\sigma } ^{\\dagger}c_{-m_2,\\sigma}\\ + \\ ... \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 describes the free ( uncoupled ) electrons and the fivefold - degenerate vibration of frequency @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 introduces a ( rotationally invariant ) standard linear coupling between the electronic state and the vibrational mode .",
    "the dimensionless linear coupling parameter is indicated as @xmath0 ( not to be confused with the magnetic factors @xmath27 ) . here",
    "we neglect higher - order terms in the boson operators , indicated with continuation dots .",
    "orbital currents are associated with the partly filled @xmath3 level , which is known to derive essentially from a superatomic @xmath28 orbital of c@xmath8 as a whole.@xcite these orbital currents give rise to a magnetic moment , which we now wish to calculate .",
    "electron spin also contributes to the total magnetic moment .",
    "although uninfluenced by jt coupling ( the hamiltonian ( [ hesplic : eq ] ) conserves spin ) , spin is coupled to the orbital motion _ via _ spin - orbit coupling @xmath29 .",
    "the general hamiltonian finally includes zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field @xmath30 along the @xmath31 axis @xmath32 where @xmath33 . for generic @xmath27 and @xmath34 factors , the appropriate value for the @xmath35 factor of the spin - orbit coupled state ( @xmath36 ) is@xcite @xmath37 for c@xmath1 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ,  @xmath41 , and @xmath42 as appropriate for a free spin",
    "thus , in order to obtain the @xmath43 factors of the individual spin - orbit split states @xmath40 and @xmath44 , we only need to calculate the value of @xmath27 .",
    "two main phenomena should affect the value of the orbital @xmath27-factor : the @xmath45 parentage of the @xmath3 ( @xmath46 ) state , and the djt coupling with the vibrons .",
    "an old paper by cohan@xcite provides tables with the icosahedral decomposition of spherical states up to @xmath47 , as expansion coefficients on an unnormalized and real basis @xmath48^{\\frac12 } \\frac{y_{l , m}\\pm y_{l ,-",

    "yielding @xmath51    on the @xmath52 basis of @xmath3 , the orbital zeeman coupling with the external magnetic field is diagonal : @xmath53 b\\ m\\ \\delta_{mm^{\\prime } } = -\\frac 52g_1\\mu_b b\\ m\\ \\delta_{mm^{\\prime } } \\ ] ] this formula implicitly defines an effective orbital @xmath54 factor @xmath55 , ( @xmath56 , in the language of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to define for the @xmath3 orbital an effective angular momentum @xmath57 , whose @xmath31-component has values -1,0,1 on the @xmath58 basis , in terms of which the orbital zeeman interaction ( [ hzeeman1:eqn ] ) is rewritten @xmath59 it is clear that the enhancement is due to the @xmath60 component in the the @xmath3 wave function , which is really @xmath28 , but is regarded formally as an effective @xmath61 state .",
    "reference  @xcite also provides the explicit spherical parentage of the lumo orbital , now in a solid - state environment . by computing the spectrum of @xmath62 on the basis provided in that work ,",
    "we obtain a somewhat smaller value for @xmath63 , namely @xmath64 .",
    "however , for gas - phase c@xmath1 the group - theoretical value for a strictly @xmath28 parentage , @xmath65 , is probably more accurate .",
    "we now concentrate on the second effect , namely that of the coupling of the electronic state with the vibrons .",
    "for clarity we start considering a single @xmath5 vibron coupled to the @xmath3 level , as in eq .",
    "( [ hschemat : eq ] ) .",
    "we represent the @xmath62 operator in second quantization as @xmath66 ( same notation as in eq .",
    "( [ hesplic : eq ] ) ) and we measure the magnetic energy @xmath67 in units of the energy scale of the vibron , @xmath68 , and indicate it with @xmath69 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is instructive to treat first the weak - jt - coupling limit .",
    "we solve the quantum problem in perturbation theory to second order in the e - v coupling parameter @xmath0 , this time including @xmath70 ( which is diagonal on the basis @xmath71 ) in the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "thus we consider @xmath72 , and apply nondegenerate perturbation theory to second order within the threefold space of the @xmath73 level ( [ psic / s : eqn ] ) .",
    "the second - order energy shift caused by @xmath26 to level @xmath74 ( @xmath75 , unperturbed energy @xmath76 ) is : @xmath77 while off diagonal terms @xmath78 vanish since @xmath26 is rotationally invariant .",
    "this shift can be rewritten as @xmath79 by substituting the clebsch - gordan coefficients , and carrying out the sum over @xmath80 , for each fixed value of @xmath81 , we get @xmath82 = -\\frac 34g^2\\hbar \\omega \\left [ \\frac 53+{\\cal o}({\\cal b } ^2)\\right ] \\\\",

    "first order in @xmath84 of the three @xmath3- derived levels is finally @xmath85 the result of e - v coupling is a reduction of both zero - point energy ( @xmath86 ) , and magnetic moment . by identification",
    "we obtain @xmath87 the desired perturbative result for the reduction of the @xmath88-factor due to weak coupling to an @xmath5 mode .",
    "the factor @xmath89 reflects the @xmath28 parentage and @xmath90 is the ( weak - coupling ) ham reduction factor@xcite of this djt problem , correctly coincident with that obtained for a general vector observable by bersuker and polinger.@xcite as anticipated , the reduction factor reflects the increased `` effective mass '' of the @xmath3 electron , as it carries along some ionic mass while orbiting .",
    "however , the coupling in c@xmath8 is not really weak , and perturbation theory is essentially only of qualitative value . for quantitative accuracy , we can instead solve the problem by numerical ( lanczos ) diagonalization,@xcite which is feasible up to realistically large coupling strengths . on a basis of states @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the state with no vibrons and no electrons ) , truncated to include up to some maximum number @xmath93 of vibrons , ( @xmath93 must be larger for larger coupling ) we diagonalize the hamiltonian operator ( [ hschemat : eq ] ) , and take the numerical derivative of the ground - state energy with respect to the magnetic field @xmath83 .",
    "again , we consider here only the orbital part , and ignore spin for the time being . in fig .  [ gfactor : fig ] we plot the resulting reduction of @xmath88-factor as a function of @xmath94 for a single @xmath5 mode .",
    "the initial slope at @xmath95 coincides correctly with @xmath96 , while at larger coupling , the behavior is compatible with the expected huang - rhys  type decrease , @xmath97    we now repeat the same diagonalization including all the eight @xmath5 vibrons with their realistic couplings , as extracted by fitting gas - phase photoemission spectra of c@xmath1.@xcite including , as in our previous calculation of ground state and excitation energies,@xcite up to @xmath93=5 vibrons for an accuracy of better than two decimal figures , we obtain@xcite for the orbital factor of the @xmath3 lumo of c@xmath8 a final value of @xmath98 , whence @xmath99    with this orbital @xmath27-factor , we can now move on to compute the overall @xmath35-factor in a realistic situation , where however spin - orbit must be included .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath100 in the @xmath3 state of c@xmath8 is not known .",
    "we estimate it by using straightforward tight - binding , as follows . starting from @xmath101 and @xmath102 orbitals for each c atom , and including spin degeneracy , we diagonalize the 480x480 first - neighbor hopping hamiltonian matrix to obtain all the molecular orbitals .",
    "spin - orbit in this scheme is obtained by adding to the hopping hamiltonian a local coupling on each individual carbon in the form @xmath103 the level splitting introduced by this term defines the precise value of spin - orbit coupling for each molecular orbital .",
    "we are dealing with @xmath104-states , which are unaffected by spin - orbit in a planar case , such as in graphite .",
    "however , in fullerene , due to curvature , there will be an effect .",
    "in particular the splitting between the lumo states @xmath105 and @xmath106 gives the spin - orbit coupling for the lumo . our calculation yields @xmath107 for the @xmath3 state of c@xmath8 when all bonds are assumed to have equal lengths , slightly increasing to @xmath108 when bond alternation is included . since @xmath109 @xmath110,@xcite",
    "we conclude that the effective spin - orbit splitting of a @xmath3 electron in c@xmath1 is of the order of @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "this value is exceedingly small , due both to the small value of @xmath100 in carbon , a low - z element , and ( mainly ) to the large curvature radius of c@xmath8 .",
    "for relatively large radius @xmath113 , as appropriate to fullerenes and nanotubes , one can expect a small spin - orbit effect in @xmath104-states , of order @xmath114 , the lowest power of curvature which is independent of its _",
    "sign_. the @xmath104-electron radius of c@xmath8 , @xmath115 5 , is one order of magnitude larger than in the carbon atom , correctly suggesting a reduction of two orders of magnitude from the atom to c@xmath8 .",
    "larger splittings of 30 - 50@xmath110 observed in luminescence spectra had earlier been attributed to spin - orbit.@xcite these values are incompatible with our estimate , and we conclude that these splittings must be of different origin , unless an enhancement of two orders of magnitude over the gas phase could somehow arise due to the host matrix .",
    "we can now include this spin - orbit coupling in the calculation of the full @xmath0-factor .",
    "a strong  spin - orbit approach@xcite @xmath116 , relevant for some jt transition impurities , is not useful here , since clearly @xmath117mev@xcite @xmath118 . in this case , the purely orbital description of the berry phase djt of refs .",
    "@xcite provides the correct gross features , to which spin - orbit adds small splittings .",
    "these splittings are controlled by the @xmath35 factors of eq .",
    "( [ coupledgfac : eqn ] ) . in our @xmath119 case ,",
    "an effective `` @xmath61 '' ground state is turned , for positive @xmath100 , into a `` @xmath40 '' ground - state doublet and a ",
    "@xmath44  excited quartet .",
    "if we assume the usual weak - field limit @xmath120 , we can recast eq .",
    "( [ coupledgfac : eqn ] ) in the form @xmath121 and @xmath122 according to these linear formulae , the orbital reduction factor @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ gfactor : fig ] ) is easily deformed on the vertical axis to give @xmath35 . since @xmath27 decreases from 1 to 0 for increasing jt coupling , we see that while @xmath123 is always positive , @xmath124 may instead become _ negative _ at large jt coupling . for example , if the @xmath28 parentage enhancement is neglected , then @xmath124 ranges from @xmath125 at zero coupling to @xmath126 at strong coupling . including the @xmath89 orbital parentage factor , @xmath124 finally varies from @xmath127 to @xmath126 .    the physical reason for a possible overall negative @xmath0-factor for @xmath128 at large e - v coupling , where @xmath129 , is also clear .",
    "the @xmath40 overall_mechanical _ angular momentum is dominated by @xmath38 orbital component .",
    "magnetic _ moment is instead dominated by the spin component , due to the strong reduction of the orbital part .",
    "but in the @xmath40 state , spin and orbit are coupled ( mainly ) upside down , whence the sign inversion .    inserting the orbital @xmath27 factor ( [ geff2 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ gj1/2],[gj3/2 ] ) , we get the final effective @xmath0-factor for the ground state manifold of gas - phase c@xmath1 @xmath130",

    "of the seven lines expected , two correspond to ( apparent ) @xmath0-factors vastly larger than 2 , and five to @xmath0-factors vastly smaller than 2 .",
    "these @xmath0-factors are only apparent , since they depend on the field ( since it is not weak ) , and through it on the frequency chosen . as the figure indicates , the weak - field limit for c@xmath1 should only really be achieved with fields in the order of a few hundred gauss .",
    "three main predictions result from the present calculation . first , that the molecular spin - orbit splitting is very small , a fraction of a degree kelvin .",

    "a detailed discussion of the quenching of quantum orbital effects is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , we think that coupling to the host matrix , however weak it may be in some cases , must be responsible for the apparent quenching from djt to static jt",
    ". one possibility , for example , is that the extra electron on c@xmath1 acts to strongly polarizes the surrounding , which in turn slows down and damps the quantum mechanical electron tunneling between different jt valleys .",
    "insofar as these couplings seem ubiquitous and fatal to the djt , we would provisionally tend to conclude that gas - phase studies may represent the only serious possibility for the observation of orbital moments in fullerene ions .",
    "stern - gerlach  like measurements of magnetic moment in gas - phase c@xmath1 , or other similar experiments , are therefore called for to provide a definitive confirmation of the striking quantum orbital effects described in this paper . since to our knowledge",
