    "current induced magnetization reversal of magnetic multilayers has attracted much research interest due to its rich physics and potential applications in spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite spin valve , consisting of two ferromagnetic layers and one nonmagnetic spacer in between , is one of such multilayer structures . in a spin valve ,",
    "one of the magnetic layers , acting as a spin polarizer , is thick so that conducting electrons are polarized after passing through it .",
    "the polarized conducting electrons will transfer their spin angular momentums to local magnetization of the thinner free magnetic layer , resulting in the spin transfer torque ( stt ) effect first proposed by slonczewski @xcite and berger .",
    "@xcite although the stt has many advantages over a magnetic field in manipulating magnetization state , @xcite a large current density is needed to achieve a technologically useful magnetization switching speed , @xcite but the associated joule heating could affect device performance .",
    "therefore , the current density reduction becomes a challenging issue from the spintronics application viewpoint .",
    "xrw2    many efforts have been devoted to the issue , including using optimized time - dependent current pulse , @xcite pure spin current , @xcite and thermal activation .",
    "@xcite one direct approach is to increase the magnitude of the stt under a given current through unique geometry design . in 2003 , berger @xcite proposed a novel magnetic multilayer architecture called dual spin valve ( dsv ) where the free magnetic layer is sandwiched between two thicker pinned magnetic layers with opposite magnetizations .",
    "it is predicted that the stt applied on the free magnetic layer should be much larger than that in a traditional spin valve for a given current in the diffusion regime .",
    "@xcite the argument is that spins accumulate at both non - magnetic / magnetic interfaces of the free layer and stt is proportional to spin accumulations .",
    "@xcite however , it is not clear whether this stt enhancement can occur in dsv in the ballistic regime without spin accumulations .",
    "moreover , the analytical formalism for the stt in dsv is still an open problem up to now .",
    "@xcite these are the focuses of present paper . a full - quantum description of the stt , valid when both the mean - free path and the spin - flip relaxation length are larger than the thickness of the spacers , is presented . averaged ( over electron phases ) stt is obtained analytically within the slonczewski s semiclassical approach @xcite when all magnetic layers are perfect polarizers .",
    "it is found that stt in dsv , depending on the orientation of free layer and the degree of electron polarization , can be enhanced by a factor of tens in comparison with that in a spin valve .",
    "the general cases of arbitrary transmission and reflection coefficients of free layer are also numerically calculated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , a physical picture of stt origin in both spin valve and dsv is presented .",
    "iii is the theoretical model and formulation of the electron transport through a dsv .",
    "the results , including the analytical expression of the stt on the free layer within the slonczewski approach , are given in sec .",
    "v is the summary .",
    "is the applied bias . fm@xmath0 are ferromagnetic layers and nm@xmath1 are nonmagnetic layers . ( c )",
    "wave functions at the interfaces of regions ( @xmath2 ) in dsv and the coordinates orientation . ]",
    "it shall be useful to present first a physical picture about stt origin in spin valve and , in particular , its enhancement in dsv .",
    "consider a spin valve , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , consisting of a pinned ferromagnetic layer fm@xmath3 and a free ferromagnetic layer fm@xmath4 separated by a nonmagnetic spacer nm .",
    "the magnetizations of fm@xmath5 and fm@xmath6 are represented by unit vectors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and their saturated magnetizations .",
    "for the simplicity , we assume that both ferromagnetic layers are perfect spin filters , such that spins aligned parallelly with the layer magnetization can completely transmit through the layer , while antiparallel spins are totally reflected . in this ideal case",
    ", a closed analytical solution of the stt can be obtained , which will be shown later .",
    "consider electrons flowing from the left to the right in fig .",
    "the right - going electrons are initially polarized along @xmath9 direction after passing through fm@xmath5 .",
    "they will remain their spin polarization when they impinge on fm@xmath6 , as long as the spacer thickness is much shorter than the spin - diffusion length , which is usually the case in nanoscale spin valves . because the polarization direction of fm@xmath6 is noncollinear with that of fm@xmath5 , an electron polarized along @xmath9 is the superposition of two states along @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that the component along @xmath10 can transmit through fm@xmath6 while that along @xmath11 is totally reflected since fm@xmath6 is a perfect polarizer .",
    "thus , there will be a net angular momentum transfer , perpendicular to @xmath10 , from impinged electrons to fm@xmath6 , resulting in a torque on fm@xmath6 to align its magnetization toward @xmath12 , as shown by the blue arrow in fig .",
    "this is the origin of stt in spin valve .",
    "it should be pointed out that the subsequent multiple reflections of electrons within the nm spacer by the two fm / nm interfaces will reduce the stt , since the reflected electrons ( dashed symbols in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) from fm@xmath6 to fm@xmath5 and back to fm@xmath6 will exert a torque along @xmath13 .",
    "however , the net torque will not be zero since the reflected electrons have smaller flux than that of the original injected electrons .",
    "let us now examine the spin transfer in a dsv shown in fig .",
    "on the top of a usual spin valve ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , an additional pinned ferromagnetic layer fm@xmath14 with an antiparallelly aligned magnetization to fm@xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath15 , is added so that the free layer fm@xmath4 is now sandwiched between fm@xmath3 and fm@xmath14 , separated by two nonmagnetic spacers nm@xmath3 and",
    "nm@xmath4 , respectively . similar to the case of a spin valve , right - going electrons transmitting through fm@xmath3 will exert a stt on fm@xmath4 to align @xmath8 with @xmath7 , as shown by the blue arrow in fig .",
    "after the electrons transmit through fm@xmath4 , most of them will be reflected by fm@xmath14 and then impinge again on fm@xmath4 , as shown by red - dashed symbols in fig",
    "thus , they will exert another stt on fm@xmath4 along @xmath16 direction , resulting in the stt enhancement .",
    "multiple reflections in region 2 ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) tend to reduce the torque but will not cancel it totally . in the following sections we will verify this physical picture through a full - quantum mechanics calculation .",
    "single charge and spin transport theory in magnetic multilayers was well developed and approaches vary from classical valet - fert theory in the diffusive regime , @xcite matrix boltzmann equation formalism , stiles2 to full - quantum mechanical treatments .",
    "slon , stiles1,waldron , brataas1,krstajic , waintal , xiao in the present paper , we will adopt a full - quantum mechanical description called scattering matrix method @xcite that is valid for ballistic transmission .",

    "for instance , @xmath244 if @xmath245 and @xmath246 while the enhancement ratio approaches to @xmath247 ( red dash line shown in fig .",
    "5 ) when @xmath27  is close to @xmath248 the reason is that there is no difference between a dsv and a usual spin valve when layers fm@xmath3 and fm@xmath4 are antiparallelly aligned , since fm@xmath14 would not reflect electrons coming out of fm@xmath4 in such case .",
    "the results are qualitatively consistent with fuchs _",
    "et al_. s experiment @xcite which shows that the reduction of threshold current switching fm@xmath54 from parallel to antiparallel , with respect to fm@xmath3 , is substantial , while it is only of modest size from antiparallel to parallel in dsv compared to that in conventional spin valve .    from the qualitative physical picture and quantum mechanical calculations ,",
    "we conclude that stt can be greatly enhanced in dsv compared to that in spin valve structure in the ballistic regime without spin accumulations .",
    "the findings of the physics behind and the analytical formula of stt in this emerging geometry should be interesting for both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite concerns .",
    "micromagnetic simulation based on our new @xmath223function ( eq . ) and landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite will be a direction of future research .",
    "the behavior of stt in asymmetric dsv when the widths of two nms are different , i.e. , @xmath249 is also an interesting issue for further investigation .",
    "although the advantage of stt enhancement is unambiguously demonstrated in our results , the accuracy of the analytical formula still needs experimental confirmation .",
    "we suggest to use a recently developed technique called spin - transfer - driven ferromagnetic resonance ( st - fmr ) @xcite to measure the angular dependence of the stt in dsv .",
    "in conclusion , we derive the stt acting on the free magnetic layer in a dsv structure in the ballistic regime .",
    "a full - quantum mechanics description of the stt is presented , which is valid for nanoscale dsvs where both the electron mean - free path and the spin - flip relaxation length are larger than the thickness of the spacers .",
    "@xcite using a quasi - one - dimensional model and within the slonczewski s approach , we obtained the analytical form of the stt when all magnetic layers are perfect polarizers .",
    "similar to the results in the diffusive regime , the stt is dramatically enhanced in comparison to that in a conventional spin valve although no spin accumulation exists at the magnetic - nonmagnetic interfaces . depending on the orientation of free magnetic layer and the polarization degree of electrons ,",
    "the stt can be enhanced by a factor of a few tens .",
    "our analytical @xmath223function provides a theoretical base for the micromagnetic simulation of the spin dynamics in dsv .",
    "the general cases when transmission and reflection probabilities of free layer are different from zero or one are also numerically calculated , which shows that the sign of the torque may change under different transmission probabilities .",
    "these results should be useful for the switching current reduction in magnetization reversal .",
