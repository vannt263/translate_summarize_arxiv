    "@xmath24 the planet obtains a high eccentricity when the binary has reached a 10 d period , but remains stable . for a 5 d period binary",
    "the planet does not survive for more than a couple of million years , because the very short - period inner binary is no - longer able to shield the planet from the perturbations from the tertiary star .",

    "[ fig : stability_limits ] we plot the inner and outer stability limits as functions of @xmath52 , for @xmath6 = 0 ( dark blue , solid ) and 0.25 ( light blue , dashed ) . because the circumbinary precession timescale gets longer during the shrink , the tertiary star has an increasing influence over the planet .",
    "we found that this caused the outer stability limit to move inwards as @xmath52 decreased .",
    "as @xmath52 decreases the inner stability limit should also move inwards ( e.g. @xmath56 au for @xmath57 d from eq .",
    "[ eq : stability_limit_cb ] ) .",
    "however , this is not a physically meaningful limit for any orbiting planets because they had to form around the wider primordial binary where @xmath58 au .",
    "therefore , we define the inner stability limit as a constant , derived from the case of the primordial binary .",
    "overall , the shrinking of the binary via kctf can be seen as a destabilising process , as only planets formed relatively close to the inner binary have a change of surviving the shrinking process .",
    "there is only a narrow 2 au region where a planet could possibly form and survive , assuming that the tertiary star has a circular orbit .",
    "for @xmath26 the inner and outer stability limits are the same ( at 4 au ) when @xmath52 reaches 5 d , and hence the likelihood of both forming a planet in these circumstances and having it survive the kctf process down to a 5 d inner binary is small .",
    "our analysis so far has been limited to n - body orbital dynamics .",
    "however planets are believed to form in discs and only under certain favourable conditions .",
    "these necessary conditions further restrict the possible range of disc radii that can allow planet formation in a stellar triple system .    a _ circumbinary _ disc is expected to have a truncated inner edge near the n - body stability limit @xcite . however , it is considered theoretically challenging to form circumbinary planets close to this inner edge , due to secular forcing excreted by the binary that creates a hostile region for planetesimal accretion @xcite .",
    "the favoured theory is that planets are formed farther out in the disc in a more placid environment , before migrating inwards and halting near the inner truncation radius of the disc @xcite .",
    "this theory naturally explains the pile - up of planets in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability_limit ] .",
    "the fact that the abundance of circumbinary planets appears to be similar to that around single stars further supports this theory .",
    "a similar abundance implies a similar formation efficiency and environment , and a circumbinary disc only resembles a circumstellar disc far away from the inner binary .",
    "the implication is that a true inner limit for planet formation may be substantially farther out than the limit of eq .",
    "[ eq : stability_limit_cb ] .",
    "the formation of a _ circumprimary _ planet is also constrained by the interaction with the outer star , due to an outer truncation of the disc and perturbations on the planetesimals within .",
    "like for the circumbinary case , the _ outer _ truncation radius in this case is also similar to the n - body stability limit @xcite .",
    "however , here again the formation of planets in a circumprimary disc in the presence of a massive , inclined stellar companion can pose a significant theoretical challenge @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies expect the particles in the protoplanetary disc to undergo significant modulations in eccentricity and inclination with different periods and amplitudes at different radial distances , making planetesimal collisions destructive rather than accretive ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this matches our results which show stable orbits , but with large fluctuations in eccentricity and inclination . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoomed_deltai ] we demonstrate this further with a zoomed version of the variation of @xmath37 from fig .",
    "[ fig : example_deltai ] for @xmath15 au and @xmath6 = 0.25 .",
    "the fluctuations are of a couple of degrees in amplitude and on a short timescale with respect to planet formation .",
    "it is possible , however , that if these fluctuations are sufficiently mild they may be damped by the self gravity of the disc @xcite or viscous dissipation @xcite .    like in the circumbinary case ,",
    "the perturbations on the disc will be strongest near the outer truncation radius .",
    "this suggests a more restrictive outer formation boundary .",
    "these considerations are in accordance with observations showing that the properties of planets in _",
    "orbits are roughly indistinguishable to planets around single stars only if the binary companion is farther than @xmath59 au @xcite , although the observational evidence for this is currently based on low number statistics .",
    "this finding is consistent with the scenario that giant planets are formed behind the snow line at at @xmath60 au ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that formation may be inhibited if the snow line is too close to or beyond the outer stability limit .",
    "our analysis so far has only considered planets with static semi - major axes . however , as previously discussed , the favoured paradigm is that the circumbinary planets generally migrate inwards before being halted near the inner edge of the disc .",
    "the disc dispersal timescale @xcite is expected to be much shorter than the kctf timescale @xcite , and hence any migration will only occur around the primordial binary .",
    "this migration may have a positive or negative effect on planet survival , depending on the relative timescales of the inner binary kozai cycles and disc migration .",
    "the disc truncation radius corresponds closely to the stability limit , which is in turn a function of @xmath22 .",
    "if the planet migrates quickly and reaches the inner edge of the disc while the inner binary is still circular , then it will have migrated in too far and will be ejected once @xmath22 is subsequently excited during kozai cycles . alternatively ,",
    "if the planet migrates slowly then the inner binary will have already undergone a full kozai cycle and the disc will be truncated farther out , meaning that the planet will not get too close . according to sect .",
    "[ sec : shrinking_inner_binary ] , having the planet near this edge will aid its later survival as the inner binary shrinks under kctf .      our analysis has assumed that there is only one circumbinary planet in the system , however with the discovery of kepler-47 it is known that multi - planet circumbinary systems do exist in nature .",
    "multi - planet stability has been analysed in circumbinary systems @xcite but never in the presence of a third star .",
    "when there are multiple planets in the system then there may be planet scattering events ( e.g. @xcite in the context of planets around single stars ) .",
    "this process may even be amplified in multi - stellar systems due to the eccentricity variations induced in the planets ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_eccentricity ] ) , leading to more close encounters .",
    "planet - planet scattering may lead to the orbits being pushed either inwards or outwards , potentially moving planets into unstable orbits .",
    "a planet may also induce an apsidal precession on other planets , which could possibly suppress kozai perturbations from the tertiary star .",
    "if kctf proceeds unhindered by the multi - planet system , the host binary will shrink and the secular timescale it imparts on the planets will sweep over a large range . this evolution would be similar to a sweeping secular resonance @xcite : when the difference in binary - forced precession frequencies of the planets matches the precession frequencies between the planets , it may lead to eccentricity excitation and perhaps destabilisation .",
    "of a planet on an initially coplanar orbit at 7 au around a primordial 100 d binary with a circular tertiary star at 100 au , taken from the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_deltai].,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we here summarise our explanation for the lack of observed transiting planets around very short - period binaries , due to the kctf process .",
    "below is a list of all the key ingredients and constraints .    1 .   the planet forms around a long - period primordial binary undergoing high eccentricity kozai cycles induced by the distant companion .",
    "2 .   to avoid ejection , the planet can not be too close to the eccentric inner binary , so it can only reside on a relatively wide orbit : @xmath61 .",
    "however , the planet also can not orbit too far from the inner binary , in order to have its kozai cycles induced by the tertiary suppressed by the binary .",
    "4 .   if the tertiary star is eccentric , as is often the case , then the region of stability is even smaller .",
    "5 .   if the planet is sufficiently massive and on a sufficiently close but stable orbit , it may inhibit the kozai modulation of the binary , and therefore prevent kctf shrinkage .",
    "6 .   assuming that the binary orbit is able to shrink , some planets become unstable , because the suppression of the kozai cycle by the binary ( constraint ( iii ) ) becomes too weak .",
    "even if kozai cycles of the planet are suppressed by the inner binary , it still obtains some variation in @xmath37 .",
    "8 .   considering the disc environment",
    "within which planets form leads to further restrictions being imposed , because the inner and outer edges of the truncated disc are probably too chaotic for planet formation .",
    "finally , planet migration has the potential to either help or hinder the survival of planets .",
    "there is only a small parameter space where the planet can form , survive and not inhibit kctf on the binary . in our example in this section only roughly neptune - mass planets between 2 and 3 au fulfilled all of the above criteria .",
    "furthermore , the surviving planets were misaligned by over @xmath62 .",
    "this triple star configuration would be even more restrictive if the perturbing strength of the tertiary were increased by ( i ) an increased mass ratio @xmath63 , ( ii ) a decreased semi - major axis ratio @xmath64 , ( iii ) an increased @xmath6 or ( iv ) an increased mutual inclination @xmath38 , leading to higher eccentricity kozai cycles .",
    "we conclude that most triple star systems evolving under kctf are not conducive to hosting planets .",
    "alternatively they host planets biased towards small masses , long periods and misaligned orbits , which are difficult to detect via transits .    the known circumbinary planets around wider binaries likely formed in a more placid environment , suggesting that companion stars either do not exist or are too far away to have an effect , like in ph-1/kepler-64 .",
    "we await future observations to confirm this .",
    "the fact that these planets have been found near the inner stability limit suggests that the binary orbit has not shrunk over a long timescale ( e.g. via kctf ) after planet migration has finished .",
    "our analysis could be further extended by testing a wider range of orbital parameters to quantify different regimes of secular evolution of planets in triple star systems , similar to the approach taken in @xcite , but this is beyond the scope of the current more qualitative investigation .    whilst this general argument developed",
    "may account for the majority of the non - detections of transiting planets around short - period binaries , it may not be the only effect present .",
    "very close binaries are tidally locked , which increases the rotation speed and can lead to increased stellar activity .",
    "the standard _ kepler _",
    "30-minute cadence may lead to insufficient sampling at the shortest periods .",
    "and finally , @xcite calculated that some of the closest eclipsing binaries may be sufficiently inclined with respect to our line of sight that transits by coplanar planets are not geometrically possible",
    ".      some level of planet formation and survival might be possible in this shrinking binary scenario , however the bias towards planets with small masses and wide , misaligned orbits creates significant detection limitations .",
    "to find such planets it is likely that new techniques will need to be developed .",
    "the four years of _ kepler _  photometric data are yet to be exhaustively searched , and may still yield discoveries of misaligned planets via eclipse timing variations @xcite , or transits on non - eclipsing binaries @xcite , particularly on binaries found with the beer technique @xcite . a re - observation of the _ kepler _  field by the future _ plato",
    "_ satellite may lead to transits on the existing sample of eclipsing binaries by new planets that have precessed into view .",
    "radial velocity surveys can detect misaligned circumbinary planets , however short - period binaries are tidally locked , leading to an increased rotation velocity that decreases spectral precision .",
    "there is also potential for gravitational lensing and direct imaging @xcite discoveries of long - period circumbinary planets .",

    "<S> only small planets on wide and inclined orbits may form , survive and allow for the inner binary shrinkage . </S>",
    "<S> those are difficult to detect .    </S>",
