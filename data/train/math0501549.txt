    "then the above prescription can be used to compute @xmath119 ( when @xmath118 and @xmath116 are colored by @xmath106 ) as a map @xmath120 , for any representation @xmath106 ( the color of the one open strand ) .",
    "this map commutes with the action of @xmath62 , so that if @xmath106 is irreducible it is given by multiplication by a scalar , namely @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the unknot with framing zero . for @xmath122",

    "the above functorial prescription for @xmath124 when @xmath5 is a knot expressed as the closure of a 1-tangle @xmath116 , may be rewritten algebraically as follows .",
    "first assume that @xmath116 is presented as a tangle diagram in generic position , in which the crossings are between downward oriented strands ( this is always possible ) .",
    "recall that @xmath128 where the sum is over @xmath129 an indexing set ( in this case , pairs of non - negative integers @xmath68 ) .",
    "place an element of @xmath130 at each crossing . in the neighborhood of each crossing",
    "decorate the crossing stands by elements of @xmath62 according to figure  2 ; @xmath131 on the overcrossing arc and @xmath132 on the undercrossing arc , where @xmath133 denotes the sign of the crssing ( @xmath134 for a slash crossing and @xmath135 for a backslash crossing ) . at local maxima",
    "/ minima oriented leftwards decorate the strand by @xmath136 , @xmath137 respectively ; rightward oriented cups and caps receive no decoration .",
    "+    then @xmath138 is the evaluation in the chosen representation of the algebra element read off the diagram by tracing the tangle strand according to its orientation , and writing down the decorations in the form of a product from left to right , and then summing over all labels @xmath67 at crossings .",
    "in fact , in the correct quotient of @xmath62 , the algebra element itself is an invariant ( this is the universal @xmath139 invariant ) ; however we do not need this here .    in a general tangle diagram , crossings need not always occur only between downward oriented strands .",
    "however , other crossings can always be redrawn in terms of such downward oriented crossings , at the cost of introducing extra caps and cups , by  internally rotating \" the crossing .",
    "for example a crossing of two upward oriented strands can be obtained by  internally rotating \" a downward oriented crossing through @xmath140 , either clockwise or anticlockwise and consistency of the results follows from the fact that @xmath141 along with @xmath142 @xmath143 .",
    "+    there are altogether eight crossing types given by the orientations on the two strands as well the sign of the crossing itself .",
    "the result is that for an arbitrarily oriented crossing , the undercrossing arc is decorated with @xmath144 while the overcrossing arc is decorated with @xmath145 _ except _ in the case of a left pointing crossing in which case it is decorated by @xmath146 .",
    "+      we will now proceed to carry out the above prescription at the quantum group level for an arbitrary 1-tangle , producing a prescription for @xmath147 as a state sum of scalar quantities .",
    "the combinatorial data involved in specifying a knot @xmath5 , presented as a 1-tangle closure can be contained in its gauss diagram .",
    "that is , consider the knot as parametrised by an ( orieted ) circle .",
    "each crossing in @xmath5 corresponds to exactly two points on the circle , one for the underpass and the other for the overpass .",
    "encode this by joining the points on the circle by an oriented chord from overpass to underpass , marked by a sign to denote the sign of the crossing .",
    "the resulting diagram is known as the _ gauss diagram _ of @xmath5 ; it is an oriented signed chord diagram on an oriented circle .",
    "this is now sufficient data to encode the knot .",
    "unfortunately the above description of the algorithm for @xmath147 requires also a tangle presentation with left pointing crossings / cups / caps marked .",
    "this requires that the circle be marked with a basepoint as well as blobs @xmath148 at left pointing cups / caps with additionally left pointing crossings marked .",
    "( note that only left pointing cups / caps / crossings in the long knot are marked ; these may differ from those in the closure ) .",
    "since @xmath149 , instead of marking a chord as  left pointing \" ( whose corresponding crossing was left pointing ) , one may equivalently place @xmath150 and @xmath151 blobs on the outer circle just before and after the outward pointing ( corresponding to the overcrossing arc ) end of that chord .",
    "the result is an _ enhanced gauss diagram _ in which additional marks have been placed on the outer circle , namely the basepoint and blobs @xmath148 .",
    "figure  5 shows an example for the figure 8 knot .",
    "+    let @xmath152 be such an enhanced gauss diagram for a knot @xmath16 with @xmath153 crossings .",
    "in order to write formulae more easily , we give complete combinatorial data for @xmath152 .",
    "number the crossings ( chords of @xmath152 ) by @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath155 denote the sign ( orientation ) of the crossing , positive for a slash crossing pointing up / down .",
    "as we go around the circle , we encounter @xmath156 contributions from crossings which we will index by @xmath157 ; for each such @xmath67 there is a pair @xmath158 giving the crossing number @xmath159 and the sign with which it is encountered , @xmath160 , which is positive for an overcrossing and negative for an undercrossing . finally let @xmath161 denote the positions of the blobs @xmath148 , the @xmath162 blob appearing between the @xmath163 and @xmath164 positions on the circle , with contribution @xmath165 . throughout the remainder of this paper , we will always use @xmath166 as an index for crossings and @xmath67 , @xmath3 as indices for vertices on the gauss diagram .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath119 in the representation @xmath167 may be carried out by computing the action on the lowest weight vector @xmath168 ( equivalently it is the @xmath169 matrix element ) , and then @xmath170 here @xmath171 is the @xmath169 matrix element in the evaluation on @xmath83 of the quantum group word @xmath172 obtained by tracing round the outer circle of @xmath152 starting at the basepoint , with contributions of @xmath173 ( outward arrow / overcrossing ) , @xmath174 ( inward arrow / undercrossing ) and @xmath148 ( blobs on the circle ) , written in order from left to right .",
