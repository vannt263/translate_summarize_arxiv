    "in this supplemental material , we give a brief introduction to the method of _ irreducible blocks _ used in the main text for finding the ground state phase diagrams of classical two - component rydberg lattice gases .",
    "we will mainly focus on the concepts and how the method works .",
    "the details of the method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the method is that for a long chain with finite range interactions , the total energy of the chain can always be written as a sum of energies of a set of basic blocks .",
    "now if one of the blocks has the lowest energy per site compared to other blocks , the whole chain tends to  condense \" to that block such that the total energy of the chain is minimised and the ground state configuration of the chain would be periodic repetition of the block that has the lowest energy per site . in the following ,",
    "we give more details .     of a chain with interactions of finite range @xmath159",
    "can be written as the sum of the energy @xmath160 of another chain obtained by removing a displaceable block @xmath161 and the energy per block @xmath162 of an infinite chain consisting of periodic repetition of that displaceable block .",
    "see text for details on the definition of displaceable block . ]",
    "suppose we have a classical one - dimensional lattice system with @xmath22 lattice sites , where each site @xmath163 can take @xmath164 @xmath165 possible configurations and the interaction of the system has a finite range of @xmath159 .",
    "we first define a _ displaceable block _ with @xmath166 sites from @xmath123 to @xmath167 ( see fig .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) ) as following : if the configuration of the @xmath159 sites starting from @xmath123 and the @xmath159 sites from @xmath168 are isomorphic , i.e. , if      we call the block of @xmath166 sites from @xmath123 to @xmath167 a _ displaceable block_. if a chain involves a displaceable block , we call the chain reducible",
    ". otherwise , we call it irreducible . now if we remove the displaceable block from the chain , we find the energy @xmath170 of the original chain can be written as      where @xmath162 is the energy per block of an infinite chain consisting of periodic repetition of the displaceable block and @xmath160 denotes the energy of the chain obtained after removing the displaceable block from the chain .",
    "the very neat expression of ( [ eq1 ] ) comes from the fact that for interactions with a finite range @xmath159 , the interaction terms around the boundary site of @xmath163 can be completely transferred to that around site @xmath172 since the @xmath159 sites starting from @xmath123 and the @xmath159 sites starting from @xmath168 are exactly the same by the definition of displaceable block .",
    "now we define the reducibility or irreducibility of a block by the corresponding reducibility or irreducibility of the chain obtained from periodic repetition of the block , i.e. , an _",
    "irreducible block _",
    "@xmath173 is a block such that there is no displaceable block in the infinite chain obtained by periodic repetition of @xmath173 .",
    "so we can repeat the above process to remove further more displaceable blocks and at the end , we get @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the energy of an irreducible chain and the sum is over all the irreducible blocks .",
    "now it is clear , if @xmath22 is very large and if the minimum value @xmath176 ( i.e. , the energy per site of an irreducible block @xmath173 with number of lattice sites @xmath177 ) , occurs for only one block , then the ground state configuration of the chain corresponds to the periodic repetition of that block , i.e. , the ground state tends to  condense \" to the block that has the smallest energy per site .",
    "if the minimum value @xmath176 occurs for two or more blocks , then the ground state configuration can be a mixture of these blocks .    to show how the above method works , we consider some examples .",
    "for @xmath178 , i.e. , with two possible configurations ( 0 and 1 ) on each lattice site , the irreducible blocks with different range interactions of @xmath179 are listed below ( note we only retain the configurations that are invariant under rotation and/or refection , e.g. , we consider 01 and 10 equivalent ) .      for the ising model with the nearest - neighbor interaction , @xmath183 with @xmath184 or @xmath185 ) and @xmath186 ,",
    "we find the energy per site , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( we can only consider @xmath190 , since the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath191 and @xmath192 ) .",
    "so we find when @xmath193 , the ground state is ferromagnetic @xmath194 and when @xmath195 the ground state is antiferromagnetic @xmath196 .",
    "when the interaction range is @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "we can calculate the energy per site of all the irreducible blocks similarly .",
    "thus we obtain the phase diagrams in the corresponding parameter space .",
    "the energies per site of the seven blocks of the two - component classical rydberg lattice gas with only nearest - neighbour interaction ( i.e. , @xmath203 ) have been given in table 1 of the main text ( note the rule for @xmath203 is that the irreducible block can not have two same onsite configurations , otherwise the size of the block can be reduced by the definition of irreducible blocks ) . by investigating",
    "which block has the lowest energy density we have obtained the ground state phase diagrams as presented in figure 2 of the main text .",
    "though in principle , the method of irreducible blocks can be applied to any one - dimensional classical lattice models with any finite range interactions , in practice , the number of irreducible blocks increases very rapidly with the range @xmath159 of the interactions , for example , for @xmath197 and three states each site , there are 87 irreducible blocks in total @xcite .",
    "when @xmath205 , there are infinite possible ground states .",
    "this leads to the complete devil s staircase of long - range interacting ising models @xcite ."

    "<S> this also highlights the nature of the first order transitions driven by @xmath3 : the @xmath3-term of the hamiltonian is minimized by a superposition of states @xmath24 and @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> though driving by a quantum term @xmath3 , the tail of the vdw interaction leads to the emergence of a devil s staircase in the vicinity of the transition points for state @xmath0 , which behaves classically as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding numerical data around @xmath107 is shown in fig .  </S>",
