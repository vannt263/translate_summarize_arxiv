    "a continuing problem in general relativity is proving or disproving the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) developed by penrose @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis states that a physically realistic gravitational collapse must end in the formation of a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "penrose postulates that a naked singularity can not physically realistically form because the singularity would always be hidden within the event horizon of the bh @xcite . in recent years , many contradictions to the cch",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "these contradictions generally fall into two major categories .",
    "the first category discusses how naked singularities are the end state of gravitational collapse ; therefore , naked singularities violate the conditions sufficient for cosmic censorship .",
    "the second category contradicts the cch by assuming the existence of naked singularities , and demonstrates that they are a violation of the cch terms @xcite .",
    "+ a major advance in strong field lensing involved the formulation of the virbhadra - ellis lens equation @xcite .",
    "the virbhadra - ellis lens equation theoretically models small and large deflections of light near a singularity , and generates image positions based on these conditions .",
    "this is important because large bending angles of light are commonly found in strong field lensing , and most equations can not accurately model these large angles @xcite",
    ". competing lens equations like the one proposed by frittelli and newman provide exact solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the results obtained are very similar to the results of the virbhadra - ellis lens equation .",
    "therefore , the virbhadra - ellis lens equation is the preferred equation because it is much simpler and more commonly cited in the literature @xcite .",
    "+ there has been much research in recent years regarding gravitational lensing for various types of massive dark objects ( mdo ) @xcite . in order to probe the nature of the supermassive mdo in the center of the milky way ,",
    "all research regarding lensing observables is very useful .",
    "the work of virbradra et al .",

    ". a sns can be qualitatively distinguished from a sbh , wns , and msns using strong field gravitational lensing .",
    "additionally , qualitative differences were found amongst three types of sns lensing , as previously described by virbhadra and keeton .",
    "these qualitative differences allowed virbhadra and keeton to describe 3 major types of sns .",

    "compared to the sbh , the magnification centroid will be quantitatively lower and total magnification will be quantitatively higher for a constant value of @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the source , lens , and observer must be highly aligned .",
    "when making observations of the universe at great distances , uncertainty will be present due to cosmic variance @xcite . since we considered the janis - newman - winicour spacetime with a scalar field , we must expect effects on lensing due to dark energy @xcite .",
