    "however this definition is only gauge - invariant in the absence of energy transfer . as a result the evolution equations including energy transfer are particularly unpleasant  @xcite .",
    "in particular it is diffcult to show that entropy perturbations obey a homogeneous evolution equation on large scales ( i.e. , adiabatic perturbations stay adiabatic on large scales ) in the way that was recently shown for multiple interacting scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "although it has been be argued on very general grounds that this must be the case  @xcite , this fundamental result has not previously been explicitly demonstrated in treatments of interacting fluids .",
    "we have used the correct gauge - invariant generalisation of ( [ sks ] ) , allowing for energy transfer ,  _",
    "3(_- _ ) , which describes the relative displacement between the two hypersurfaces of uniform density defined with respect to the two fluids .",
    "this reduces to ( [ sks ] ) in the case of no energy transfer .",
    "it allows us to demonstrate that the evolution of the large - scale entropy perturbation , eq .",
    "( [ s_evol ] ) is sourced only by entropy perturbations and not sourced by the total curvature perturbation , @xmath0 .",
    "thus the integrated evolution on large scales , even when we include energy transfer , can be schematically represented by the linear transfer matrix : [ trans2 ] (              ) _ in .",
    "we have applied our formalism to study the evolution of curvature perturbations in the curvaton scenario where an initially isocurvature ( non - adiabatic ) perturbation in the curvaton field is transferred to the radiation fluid when the curvaton eventually decays .",
    "the decay of the curvaton represents a non - adiabatic energy source for the radiation fluid .",
    "we have numerically solved the coupled evolution equations to determine the resulting curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , for an initial entropy perturbation .",
    "thus we have calculated the transfer coefficient @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ trans2 ] ) for different parameter values of the background models .",
    "we compared our results with semi - analytic estimates based on the `` sudden - decay '' approximation @xcite where the fluids are assumed to be non - interacting up until a fixed decay time .",
    "the sudden - decay approximation is shown to give a good fit to the full result ( within 10% ) for a suitable choice of fitting parameter .",
    "in this two - fluid realisation of the curvaton scenario the interaction between the fluids leads to the relative entropy decaying to zero at late times , @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ trans2 ] ) , leaving a purely adiabatic curvature perturbation .",
    "our formalism can also be applied to cosmological models including other cosmological fluids such as baryons , cdm or neutrinos , in which case it should be possible to calculate the amplitude of any residual isocurvature perturbations that may survive after curvaton decay in different variations of the curvaton scenario .",
