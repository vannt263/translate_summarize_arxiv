    "the purpose of the paper is to study conditionings of random walks using algebraic and combinatorial tools coming from representation theory of lie algebras and their infinite - dimensional generalizations ( kac - moody algebras ) .",
    "we extend in particular some results previously obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to random paths in the weight lattice of any kac - moody algebra @xmath0 . to do this",
    ", we consider a fixed @xmath0-module @xmath4 in the category @xmath5 ( a convenient generalization of the category of lie algebras finite dimensional representations ) .",
    "it decomposes as the direct sum of its weight spaces , each such space being parametrized by a vector of the weight lattice of @xmath0 .",
    "the transitions of the random walk associated to @xmath4 are then the weights of @xmath4 .",
    "the prototype of the results we obtain appears in the seminal paper @xcite by oconnell where it is shown that the law of the one - way simple random walk @xmath6 in @xmath7 conditioned to stay in the cone @xmath8 and with drift in the interior @xmath9 of @xmath10 , is the same as the law of a markov chain @xmath11 obtained by applying to @xmath6 a generalization of the pitman transform .",
    "this transform is defined via an insertion procedure on semistandard tableaux classically used in representation theory of @xmath12 .",
    "the transition matrix of @xmath11 can then be expressed in terms of the weyl characters ( schur functions ) of the irreducible @xmath12-modules . here",
    "the transitions of the random walk @xmath6 are the vectors of the standard basis of @xmath7 which correspond to the weights of the defining representation @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the insertion procedure on tableaux and some classical facts about representation theory of @xmath12 , the main ingredients of oconnell s result are a theorem of doob on martin boundary together with the asymptotic behavior of tensor product multiplicities associated to the decompositions of @xmath15 in its irreducible components ( which in this case are counted by standard skew tableaux ) .",
    "we consider in @xcite more general random walks @xmath6 with transitions the weights of a finite - dimensional irreducible @xmath0-module @xmath4 where @xmath0 is a lie algebra .",
    "the law of @xmath6 is constructed so that the probabilities of the paths only depend of their lengths and their ends .",
    "we then show that the process @xmath11 obtained by applying to @xmath6 a generalization of the pitman transform introduced in @xcite is a markov chain .",
    "when @xmath4 is a minuscule representation ( i.e. when the weights of @xmath4 belong to the same orbit under the action of the weyl group of @xmath0 ) and @xmath6 has drift in the interior @xmath9 of the cone @xmath10 of dominant weights , we prove that @xmath11 has the same law as @xmath6 conditioned to never exit @xmath10 .",
    "similarly to the result of oconnell , this common law can be expressed in terms of the weyl characters of the simple @xmath0-modules .",
    "nevertheless the methods differ from @xcite notably because there was no previously known asymptotic behavior for the relevant tensor multiplicities in the more general cases we study .",
    "in fact , we proceed by establishing a quotient renewal theorem for general random walks conditioned to stay in a cone .",
    "when @xmath6 is not defined from a minuscule representation , we also show that the law of @xmath6 conditioned to never exit @xmath10 can not coincide with that of @xmath11 .    in @xcite",
    ", we use the renewal theorem of @xcite and insertion procedures on tableaux appearing in the representation theory of the lie superalgebras @xmath16 and @xmath17 to extend the results of @xcite to one way simple random walks conditioned to never exit cones @xmath18 for examples of cones @xmath18 different from @xmath10 .    in view of the results of @xcite",
    ", it is natural to ask whether the markov chain @xmath11 is related to a suitable conditioning of @xmath6 in the non minuscule case .",
    "also what can be said about the law of @xmath6 conditioned to never exit @xmath10 ?  in the sequel , we will answer both questions ( partially for the second ) not only for random walks defined from representations of lie algebras but , more generally , for similar random walks with transitions the weights of a highest weight module @xmath19 associated to a kac - moody algebra @xmath0 of rank @xmath20 .    by using littelmann path model @xcite , one can associate to @xmath19 a countable set of piecewise continuous linear paths @xmath21 in the weight lattice @xmath22 of @xmath0 . these paths ( called elementary in the sequel ) are regarded as functions @xmath23\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{r}}^{n}$ ] such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the weights of @xmath19 are then the elements @xmath26 the set @xmath21 has the structure of a colored and oriented graph isomorphic to the crystal graph of @xmath19 as defined by kashiwara .",
    "we use the crystal graph structure on @xmath21 to endow it as in @xcite with a probability density @xmath27 .",
    "this yields a random variable @xmath28 defined on @xmath21 with probability distribution @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the same law as @xmath28 .",
    "we then define a continuous random path @xmath3 such that for any @xmath30 , @xmath31 for any @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the sequence @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 is then a random walk with transitions the weights of @xmath19 as considered in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the paper is that , when @xmath6 has drift in @xmath9 ( i.e. in the interior of the weyl chamber of @xmath0 ) , the law of its conditioning by the event @xmath35 for any @xmath36 can be simply expressed in terms of the weyl - kac characters .",
    "so the results of @xcite remain true for a conditioning holding on the whole continuous trajectory ( not only on its discrete version at integer time ) .",
    "we also prove that the conditioned law so obtained coincides with the law of the image of @xmath6 by the generalized pitman transform .",
    "when @xmath0 is finite - dimensional and @xmath37 is minuscule we recover in particular the main results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on the representation theory side , our results also lead to asymptotic behavior of tensor product multiplicities of kac - moody highest weight modules .",
    "nevertheless our approach differ from that of @xcite since we do not use any renewal theorem .",
    "our strategy is more algebraic : we exploit the symmetry of the representations with respect to the weyl group @xmath38 of @xmath0 and study simultaneously a family of random paths @xmath39 indexed by the elements @xmath40 .",
    "in particular our proofs are independent of the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the notions of random walk and random path used in the paper .",
    "section 3 recalls the necessary background on kac - moody algebras and their representations and summarize some important results on littelmann s path model .",
    "the random path @xmath3 and the random walk @xmath6 associated to @xmath19 are introduced in section 4 together with the generalized pitman transform and the markov chain @xmath11 . in section 5",
    ", we use a process of symmetrization to define the random paths @xmath41 from @xmath42 .",
    "this allows us to give an explicit expression of the harmonic function @xmath43 for any @xmath36 in section 6 and prove our main theorem .",
    "its gives the probability that @xmath3 starting at @xmath44 remains in @xmath10 .",
    "we also extend it to the case of random walks defined from non irreducible representations of simple lie algebras .",
    "finally section 7 is devoted to additional results : we give asymptotic behavior of tensor power multiplicities and also compare the probabilities @xmath45 for any @xmath36 and @xmath46 for any @xmath47 .",
