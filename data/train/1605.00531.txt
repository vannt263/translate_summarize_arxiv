    "in the past @xmath2 years the theory of random matrices had an impressive development in theoretical physics and in a variety of disciplines .",
    "further progress and usefulness of random matrices will be linked to the ability of a specific class of random matrices to encode the relevant properties of a specific problem .",
    "for instance , random matrices with entries that vanish outside a band around the diagonal have been studied for decades as models for the crossover between a strongly disordered insulating regime , with localized eigenfunctions and weak eigenvalue correlations , and a weakly disordered metallic regime , with extended eigenfunctions and strong eigenvalue repulsion @xcite .",
    "such crossover is believed to occur in the spectra of certain random partial differential ( or difference ) operators as the spectral parameter ( energy ) is changed .",
    "a review is @xcite . +",
    "a very different case , which deserves much study , is the network of neurons . in several models",
    "the interconnections are represented by a synaptic matrix with elements drawn randomly .",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues of this matrix is useful in the study of spontaneous activity and evoked responses .",
    "it was pointed out by rajan and abbott @xcite that each node in a synaptic conductivity network is either purely excitatory or inhibitory ( dale s law ) , which leads to constraints on the signs of the matrix elements : all entries in a row describing an excitatory neuron must be positive or zero , and all entries in an inhibitory row must be negative or zero .",
    "little is known of the generic properties of this ensemble of random matrices @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we study a new class of matrices , here called _ antagonistic matrices_. they are characterized by real entries @xmath0 and @xmath1 having opposite signs , for all @xmath3 , or both zero , and @xmath4 . as such , they are a generalization of real antisymmetric matrices .",
    "an example of order @xmath5 is @xmath6 the reason for the name and the interest of such matrices is their possible relevance in models for competitive species ( predator - prey ) and for the complexity - stability debate or paradox in theoretical ecology @xcite , which is here summarized .    in a large island ,",
    "a large number @xmath7 of species live .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of living individuals of species @xmath9 at time @xmath10 .",
    "let us suppose that the interactions are described by the model @xmath11 a stationary feasible configuration , also called equilibrium point , is a configuration such that for all species : @xmath12 let @xmath13 represent the deviation from the equilibrium point .",
    "for small deviations the dynamics is linearized : @xmath14 linear stability of the equilibrium point requires that all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath15 should have negative real part .",
    "+ in general , the matrix @xmath15 is huge and the entries are almost impossible to quantify .",
    "robert may @xcite considered a model where the diagonal elements are all equal , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the matrix @xmath18 of off - diagonal elements is a real @xmath19 random matrix .",
    "he chose the entries as independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables , the single probability density @xmath20 having zero mean and variance @xmath21 . in the limit @xmath22 , with proper assumptions on the moments of the probability law ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath23 converges weakly to the uniform distribution on the disk @xmath24 , the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are predicted with large probability to have negative real part .",
    "however , with a fixed value @xmath25 , a more complex system ( that is increasing the number @xmath7 of interacting species ) will have an increasing number of eigenvalues with positive real part , and will be linearly unstable .",
    "+ the assertion that the increasing complexity of the ecological system leads to its instability was ( and is ) considered false in view of evidence .",
    "the critical analysis of r. may s paradox may be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the extreme simplicity of r. may s argument is challenging .",
    "is it possible that all the eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath26 with structure plausible to describe an ecological population , have negative real part ?",
    "+ in the mathematical literature , a matrix is said to be stable if its spectrum lies in the open left half - plane ( a survey is @xcite ) .",
    "however , the conditions on the principal minors make this approach of little use for matrices of large order . the location of eigenvalues in the complex plane may be bounded by constraining norms of the matrix or matrix rows or columns @xcite .",
    "every norm increases as the size of the matrix increases , suggesting a larger region for the location of eigenvalues .",
    "+ an interesting analysis of the dynamics , was done by fyodorov and khoruzhenko @xcite . instead of brute linearisation , they consider an appropriate non - linear form of the driving forces @xmath27 , modelled by @xmath28-dependent random matrices .",
    "they evaluate the average number of minima @xmath29 for large @xmath7 and observe a sharp transition between a single minimum and a very large number of minima , stable and unstable , as the parameter @xmath30 crosses a critical value .",
    "therefore the dynamics could be not as may s catastrophe , but a meandering between minima .",
    "+ in this paper we pursue a route suggested by empirical evidence . the extensive literature on models of real systems of many species points to three features which increase the stability of the system : 1 ) the species have a competitive ( i.e. antagonistic ) interaction : the signs in every pair @xmath31 and @xmath32 are opposite and @xmath32 are both positive .",
    "the stability of large system of mutualistic species seem to be related to a very different structure of the matrix .",
    "mutualistic interactions are ignored in this paper . ] ; 2 ) there are weak couplings among several species ; 3 ) the matrix is sparse .",
    "the ensemble of random antagonistic matrices may accommodate the three features .",
    "+ random antagonistic matrices are related to random real antisymmetric matrices and to the elliptic ensembles , whose properties are summarized in sect.2 . in sect.3 the new set of antagonistic matrices is introduced , with a discussion of single - matrix properties as well as ensemble properties , with examples . the last sect.4 is devoted to `` almost antagonist '' matrices , where the spectral goal of negative real part of eigenvalues is achieved and the matrices become strictly antagonistic in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "we summarize here the conclusions of this work : ensembles of random antagonistic matrices seem to provide a proper model to describe interactions among antagonistic species in ecological systems or possibly in other complex systems .",
    "they seem useful for their controlled spectral properties .",
