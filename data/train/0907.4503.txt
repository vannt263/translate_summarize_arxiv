    "the discovery that the quark - gluon plasma produced at rhic behaves as a nearly ideal fluid @xcite has prompted much interest into the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas .",

    "analysis of particle correlations in produced jets can provide useful information about the dynamics of the plasma including the rates of energy loss and momentum broadening @xcite , as well as the speed and attenuation length of sound waves @xcite .",
    "studying the dynamics of jets in qcd from first principles  from the initial hard process which created the jet to energy loss , showering and thermalization  is a challenging task . because of the lack of theoretical tools available for analyzing strongly coupled dynamics in qcd , it is useful to have a toy model which is qualitatively similar to qcd but where strongly coupled dynamics can be treated in a controlled manner .",
    "a class of such toy models are non - abelian theories with gravitational duals @xcite .",
    "the most widely studied example is that of strongly coupled @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "the deconfined plasma phases of qcd and sym share many qualitative properties .",
    "for example , both theories describe non - abelian plasmas with debye screening , finite spatial correlation lengths , and long distance dynamics described by neutral fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "when both theories are weakly coupled , appropriate comparisons of a variety of observables show rather good agreement @xcite .",
    "this success , combined with the lack of alternative techniques for studying dynamical properties of qcd at temperatures where the plasma is strongly coupled , has motivated much interest in using strongly coupled sym plasma as a model for qcd plasma at temperatures @xmath1 of a few times @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) .    despite their qualitative similarities at finite temperature , it should be emphasized that dynamics in sym are not a controlled approximation to those in qcd .",
    "moreover , in regimes where asymptotic freedom may be important the qualitative dynamics in sym may not resemble those in qcd .",
    "this is certainly the case during the initial hard process which creates a jet . in qcd ,",
    "asymptotic freedom guarantees that for sufficiently high energy processes , the early time dynamics will be weakly coupled .",
    "therefore , in qcd the production of high energy jets will be governed by perturbative physics .",
    "this should be contrasted with sym , where the coupling does nt run and early time dynamics are just as strongly coupled as late time dynamics .",
    "because of the above point , we chose to focus of quantities which are largely insensitive to the initial event which created the jet .",
    "our motivation is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which weak coupling physics in asymptotically free qcd is envisioned as producing a high energy excitation , whose propagation through the plasma is then modeled by studying the behavior of a similar type of excitation in a strongly coupled sym plasma . as sym contains only adjoint matter , fundamental fields",
    "must be added to the theory in order to study the propagation of fundamental representation excitations . within the context of gauge / gravity duality ,",
    "a natural choice is to add a fundamental @xmath4 hypermultiplet to sym and study @xmath4 excitations @xcite .    by studying @xmath4 excitations in strongly coupled sym plasma we",
    "can then answer the following simple set of important questions .",
    "how far can an energetic jet in a plasma propagate before it thermalizes ? where along its trajectory does a jet prefer to deposit energy and momentum ?",
    "how well is the radiation created by the jet modeled by hydrodynamics ? answering this last question is important as hydrodynamics is a much simpler theory to work with than any complete microscopic theory and it applies equally well to qcd and sym .",
    "energetic quarks moving through a plasma are quasi - particles  they have a finite lifetime which can be long compared to the inverse of their energy . because of this",
    ", some care is needed in defining observables such as the instantaneous energy loss rate or the penetration depth . at weak coupling , where a perturbative analysis is applicable , an energetic quark scattering off excitations in the medium can emit gluons which may subsequently split into further gluons or quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "an energetic quark may also annihilate with an antiquark in the medium .",
    "a natural question to consider then is which quark should one follow when computing either the position of the total excitation or its instantaneous energy loss rate ? once a quark has emitted a @xmath5 pair , or annihilated with an antiquark , it becomes ambiguous which quark was the original one .",
    "this issue is most cleanly avoided if one focuses attention not on some ( ill - defined ) `` bare quark '' , but rather on the locally conserved charges of the entire dressed excitation .    in both qcd and sym",
    "coupled to a fundamental @xmath4 hypermultiplet , there are two conserved quantities which are useful for characterizing a fundamental representation excitation . these are simply the baryon number ( or quark number ) current @xmath6 and the total stress tensor for the system @xmath7 .",
    "even though @xmath5 pairs can be produced by an energetic quark traversing the plasma , conservation of @xmath8 and @xmath7 implies that the total baryon number and four momentum of the state will remain constant . for an energetic , well collimated jet",
    ", the baryon density can remain highly localized for a long period of time .",
    "it is the collective excitation with localized baryon density which we will refer to as a dressed quark , or for the sake of brevity , simply as a quark .    with the above points in mind , let us for the moment focus not on the microscopic details needed to fully describe a quark moving through a plasma but rather on the large scale structure .",
    "[ jetbigpicture ] shows a cartoon depicting the large scale picture of a quark moving though a plasma .",
    "the quark itself is a localized object whose location is specified by the localized baryon density .",
    "specifically , the trajectory of the quark is _ defined _ to be @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the baryon number of the quark . for very energetic quarks the stress tensor",
    "will also be highly peaked in the vicinity of @xmath12 .",
    "as the quark moves through the plasma , it will experience frictional drag forces and consequently , energy and momentum will be transported from the vicinity of @xmath12 to the far zone . because sym is dissipative , gradients in the stress tensor necessarily become smaller and smaller at larger distances , and the far - zone dynamics of emitted radiation are governed by hydrodynamics . in the long wavelength limit the total stress tensor may be written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is localized about @xmath12 and @xmath15 satisfies the constituent relations of hydrodynamics together with the energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath16     a cartoon depicting the large scale structure of an energetic quark moving through a plasma . ]",
    "the _ effective source _",
    "@xmath17 for hydrodynamics is localized at the position of the quark and takes into account all microscopic dynamics in the near - zone relevant for the determination of the far - zone hydrodynamic behavior . in general its determination will require a complete microscopic calculation .",
    "however , just by energy - momentum conservation , one crucial property the effective source must satisfy is that its integral over space must give the rate that the quark loses four - momentum : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is minus the drag force acting on the quark , and thus the rate that four - momentum is transfered to hydrodynamic modes .",
    "operationally , the instantaneous drag force can be obtained by enclosing the quark s baryon density in a sphere and computing the total outward flux of four momentum as a function of time .    just as in electromagnetism , where local sources can be expanded in terms of point - like multipole moments ( _ i.e. _ derivatives of delta functions ) with each moment producing a particular falloff of the fields with distance , the long distance hydrodynamic response of an energetic quark traversing a plasma can be systematically expanded in inverse powers of distance . in doing so ,",
    "the leading long distance behavior of the hydrodynamic response is determined by the source s monopole moment @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , at leading order the source may be approximated @xmath20 we note that the coefficient of the delta function is constrained via eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) . together with the hydrodynamic constituent relations , eqs .",
    "( [ hcons ] ) and ( [ leadingsource ] ) show that the leading order behavior of the far - zone stress tensor is determined solely by the quark s trajectory @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the plasma s viscosity .",
    "in general there are two possible hydrodynamic modes an energetic quark can excite .",
    "these modes are a sound mode and diffusion mode .",
    "the diffusion mode trails behind the quark and slowly broadens with distance .",
    "this mode , symbolized in fig .",
    "[ jetbigpicture ] by the trailing flow lines , consists of laminar flow in the same direction as the quark . for supersonic motion",
    "the sound mode manifests itself as a mach cone or sonic boom .",
    "this mode is symbolized in fig .",
    "[ jetbigpicture ] by the outward moving conical wake emanating from the quark .    for heavy quarks",
    "whose motion is not ultrarelativistic , @xmath19 only depends on the temperature of the plasma , the t hooft coupling and the quark s velocity @xcite . however for ultrarelativistic quarks @xmath19 can be sensitive to the initial conditions which created the quark @xcite . as the weakly coupled hard process which creates a jet in qcd is very different than that of strongly coupled sym , for the case of light quarks",
    " whose motion is always ultrarelativistic  it is desirable to have another observable which is related to energy loss but not very sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "one quantity to consider is the maximum distance @xmath23 which a quark with initial energy @xmath24 can travel .",
    "one can imagine fixing the quark s energy and varying all other degrees of freedom characterizing the state and looking for the particular configuration which maximizes the penetration depth .",
    "therefore , essentially by construction , the initial conditions associated with quarks that maximize the penetration depth at fixed energy are much more constrained .    to define the penetration depth , we imagine measuring @xmath12 at some early time @xmath25 .",
    "we then define the penetration depth @xmath26 as @xmath27 to make the quantity @xmath26 meaningful , we also need to measure the quark s energy at time @xmath25 .",
    "if the quark has been moving for some time prior to @xmath25 , it will have deposited energy into the plasma  we must disentangle the energy deposited in the plasma from the remaining energy of the quark itself . in the limit where the quark has an arbitrarily large energy which is arbitrarily localized about @xmath21 , separating the quark s energy from the energy transfered to the plasma will be unambiguous .",
    "we consider only this limit in this paper .",
    "we now discuss jets in sym from the @xmath28 gravitational perspective .",
    "the @xmath29 geometry corresponding to an infinite equilibrium sym plasma is the product of a @xmath28 sphere and the @xmath28 ads - schwarzschild ( ads - bh ) geometry , whose metric is @xmath30 , % \\end{equation } $ ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the ads curvature radius .",
    "the ads - bh geometry contains a @xmath33 boundary at radial coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "this boundary has the geometry of minkowski space and is where the @xmath33 dual field theory should be thought of as residing .",
    "the ads - bh geometry also contains a translationally invariant event horizon at @xmath35 and has a corresponding hawking temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the addition of a @xmath4 hypermultiplet to sym is accomplished in the gravitational setting by adding a d7 brane to the @xmath29 geometry @xcite .",
    "the d7 brane fills a volume of the ads - bh geometry which extends from the boundary at @xmath34 down to maximal radial coordinate @xmath37 .",
    "the bare mass @xmath38 of the hypermultiplet is proportional to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for massless quarks the d7 brane fills all of the five - dimensional ads - bh geometry and for very heavy quarks the d7 brane ends very close to the boundary at @xmath34 .",
    "open strings which end on the d7 brane correspond to _ dressed _ quarks in the dual field theory .    in general , to study the dynamics of @xmath5 pairs in the field theory",
    "one must study dynamics of strings in the full @xmath29 geometry .",
    "the reason for this is that in general string endpoints have non - trivial trajectories on the @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the limit of large quark mass and very small quark mass it is consistent to set the motion on the @xmath40 to vanish @xcite .",
    "because of this simplification and because any additional motion of the string on the @xmath40 will only add to the energy of the string without affecting its stopping distance in the spatial direction , we choose to study only the dynamics of very heavy and massless quarks in this paper .",
    "the motion of strings corresponding to very heavy or very light quarks is quite different . for the case of very heavy quarks",
    ", the d7 brane ends at @xmath41 and string endpoints always remain close to the boundary . for very light quarks , the d7 brane fills the entire ads - bh geometry and string endpoints are allowed to fall unimpeded towards the black hole @xcite . however , in either case the late - time spatial motion of the string endpoint always ceases and in either case the total distance traveled by the endpoint can be made arbitrarily far by giving the string more momentum in the spatial directions @xcite .",
    "[ holographicjet ] shows a cartoon illustrating the gravitational dual of a quark moving through a sym plasma .",
    "this consists of a string ( shown as the magenta curve ) moving in the ads - bh geometry .",
    "the endpoints of strings are charged under a @xmath42 gauge field whose influence extends to the @xmath33 boundary .",
    "the boundary itself behaves as an ideal electromagnetic conductor @xcite , so the presence of a string endpoint induces an _ image current density _ on the boundary _ above _ the endpoint .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ holographicjet ] . via the standard gauge / gravity dictionary",
    "@xcite the induced current density corresponding to the string endpoint has the field theory interpretation as minus the expectation value of the baryon current density of a dressed quark . in the limit where the string endpoint is close to the boundary the induced baryon density is highly localized and we may approximate @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spatial position of the string endpoint @xcite .     a cartoon illustrating the gravitational dual of a quark moving through a sym plasma .",
    "]    via einstein s equations , the presence of the string will also perturb the @xmath28 geometry . in the large @xmath45 limit ,",
    "the corresponding perturbation is order @xmath46 and may be analyzed by linearizing einstein s equations .",
    "as in the electromagnetic problem , classical field theory implies the near - boundary perturbation in the @xmath28 geometry will induce a corresponding perturbation in the @xmath33 boundary stress tensor @xcite . via the gauge / gravity dictionary",
    ", the stress tensor induced on the boundary has the interpretation as the expectation value of the complete field theoretic stress tensor , and hence contains information about dynamics on _ all _ length scales .",
    "if the string endpoint is close to the boundary  either because of initial conditions or the restriction of a heavy quark  the string endpoint will have a high gravitational potential energy .",
    "it is this _ uv sensitive _ part of the string energy that we identify with the energy of a quark . via the gravitational equivalent of the electromagnetic image problem ( _ i.e. _ the gravitational bulk - to - boundary problem ) ,",
    "the high energy and momentum densities near the string endpoint get mapped onto a region of @xmath33 space which roughly coincides with the location of the quark s baryon density .",
    "that is , @xmath14 , as defined above in ( [ stressdecomp ] ) , is _ induced _ in the gravitational framework by the high gravitational and kinetic energy carried by the string endpoint .",
    "again , this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ holographicjet ] .    with the above point in mind ,",
    "a natural question arises : what is the @xmath28 gravitational description of the drag force @xmath22 ?",
    "the answer to this question can be understood by noting that each conserved `` charge '' of the string gets mapped into a conserved charge in the field theory . in the gravitational description , there in a conserved flux of energy and momentum which flows down the string from the endpoint .",
    "as the energy and momentum carried by the near - endpoint portion of the string induces @xmath14 , it must be that that this flux is related to @xmath22 .",
    "in the long wavelength limit , retardation effects in the propagation of gravitational disturbances from the bulk to the boundary can be neglected and the locally conserved flux of energy and momentum down the string  averaged over `` microscopic '' time scales of order the horizon radius  must in fact coincide with @xmath22 .",
    "heavy quarks decelerate slowly .",
    "therefore , as long as one focuses on local questions , for sufficiently large mass it is useful to consider the limit where the quark s velocity @xmath47 is constant . via gauge / gravity duality , the energy loss rate for a heavy quark moving through sym plasma at constant velocity evaluates to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the t hooft coupling @xcite .",
    "the complete ( _ i.e. _ valid on all length scales ) energy density and energy flux of a quark moving at constant velocity has been evaluated in refs .",
    "[ v75 ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , shows the complete energy density and energy flux created by a heavy quark moving at velocity @xmath50 though a strongly coupled sym plasma . in a conformal theory such as sym , the speed of sound is @xmath51 , so fig .",
    "[ v75 ] shows supersonic motion . as is evident in fig .",
    "[ v75 ] , a mach cone , with opening half angle @xmath52 is clearly visible in both the energy density and the energy flux . near the mach cone ,",
    "the bulk of the energy flux flow is orthogonal to the wavefront .",
    "also evident in fig .",
    "[ v75 ] is the presence of a diffusion wake in the energy flux",
    ".     left  plot of energy density @xmath53 . right ",
    "plot of energy flux @xmath54 . in both plots",
    "the quark is moving in the @xmath55 direction at speed @xmath50 .",
    "the flow lines on the energy flux surface are those of @xmath56 , and hence indicate the direction plasma is moving . ]    as emphasized in the previous section , with knowledge of the drag force on the quark and the viscosity of sym plasma , one can completely determine the large - distance structure of the quark s wake .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the complete quark wake to that predicted by hydrodynamics with the leading order effective source ( [ leadingsource ] ) was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was demonstrated that the hydrodynamic approximation provides a good description of the quark wake even at distances @xmath57 from the quark .",
    "therefore , essentially all of the structure seen in fig .",
    "[ v75 ] is simply that of hydrodynamics .",
    "the agreement between hydrodynamics and gauge / gravity duality in a strongly coupled sym plasma bolsters the notion that one should be able to model accurately the wake produced by a high energy quark ( or gluon ) moving through a strongly coupled qcd plasma merely using hydrodynamics",

    "]    the penetration depth of a light quark ( or gluon ) was studied in refs .",

    "as is evident from the figure , for a given energy the total distance a quark can travel is not unique .",
    "however , for a given energy there is a maximum distance a quark can travel .",
    "this bound , shown as the solid red line in fig .",
    "[ lightquark ] , is given by @xmath60 .    from the @xmath61 scaling of the penetration depth one",
    "might naively expect the light quark energy loss to scale like @xmath62 .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite this turns out not to be the case . to elucidate this point ,",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ lightquark ] is the instantaneous energy flux down a dual falling string as a function of time .",
    "the energy flux is evaluated a spatial distance @xmath63 from the string endpoint . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the flux of four momentum down the string is related to the rate the dual quark looses four momentum to the plasma .",
    "more precisely , the energy flux down the string  averaged over microscopic times , which are order @xmath64  yields the four vector @xmath22 appearing in the effective source for hydrodynamics in eq .",
    "( [ leadingsource ] ) . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ lightquark],the energy flux down the string does not decrease in a power - law fashion as a naive @xmath65 scaling of @xmath66 would suggest , but rather increases monotonically !    as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the precise form of the energy flux down the string is sensitive to the initial conditions used to create the string .",
    "however , for very long - lived excitations the late time behavior of the energy flux is universal . at late times",
    "the energy flux away from the string endpoint grows like @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the thermalization time ( _ i.e. _ roughly the time where a falling string s endpoint approaches the event horizon ) @xcite .",
    "this late - time behavior implies that after traveling substantial distances through the plasma , the thermalization of light quarks ends with a large transfer of energy to the plasma .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the energy loss rate of a fast charged particle moving through ordinary matter , where the energy loss rate has a pronounced peak ( known as a `` bragg peak '' ) near the stopping point .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that this behavior is qualitatively different from that of heavy quarks . at both weak and strong coupling",
    "heavy quarks prefer to deposit most of their energy and momentum during the initial stages of their trajectory , when their velocity is largest @xcite .",
