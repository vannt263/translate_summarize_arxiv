    "acceleration of particles in plasmas has been studied since 1980s as a possible way to future high energy colliders .",
    "there are two modifications of this concept , which differ in methods of driving the plasma wave : plasma wakefield acceleration ( pwfa ) driven by a charged particle beam@xcite and laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) driven by a short laser pulse.@xcite in both cases , the accelerated particle bunch ( witness ) must travel for some distance in the plasma to gain a substantial energy .",
    "the witness resides on the slope of a potential well ( accelerating bucket ) that moves with the speed of light @xmath0 and , in addition to accelerating the bunch , also keeps it transversely focused .",
    "the period of radial ( betatron ) oscillations of the bunch particles is universally much shorter than the acceleration distance.@xcite the accelerated bunch thus has enough time to reach a radial equilibrium with the focusing field .",
    "the only exception is the strongly nonlinear regime ( called blow - out or bubble regime@xcite ) , in which the focusing force is strictly linear in radius , and phase mixing of particle oscillations does not occur . drive bunches in pwfa ( that reside on decelerating slopes of potential wells ) also reach a radial equilibrium shortly after injection into the plasma .    finding an equilibrium bunch shape in a fixed potential",
    "well is a straightforward , though sometimes technically cumbersome , task .",
    "however , the potential well is often not fixed .",
    "the drive bunches in pwfa create the potential well themselves , so the shape of the well depends on the bunch shape , and vice versa .",
    "similarly , the witness , which seemingly propagates in the fixed wakefield of the driver , can locally modify this wakefield if the witness charge is sufficiently high to provide wave loading.@xcite    self - consistent bunch equilibria are of importance for wakefield acceleration schemes in which particle bunches propagate in a linear or moderately nonlinear plasma wave .",
    "interest to these schemes varied in the history . in early pwfa experiments@xcite ,",
    "the density of available particle bunches was small , and finding beam equilibria was a hot problem@xcite .",
    "later , with the advent of blow - out@xcite and bubble@xcite regimes , weakly nonlinear waves were relegated to the background .",
    "recently , self - modulating proton drivers@xcite and optimization of staged lwfa for collider applications@xcite have renewed interest in moderately nonlinear waves and beam equilibria .",
    "previous attempts to calculate the equilibrium bunch shape in the wakefield created by the bunch itself have not met with success.@xcite the reason is that , as we show below , the equilibrium particle distribution in the phase space is neither separable , nor gaussian , and , therefore , not tractable analytically . here",
    "we combine appropriate simplifying assumptions , analytical relationships , numerical integration , and cross - checking by first - principle simulations to reach the goal .    in sec .",

    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the equilibrium beam is @xmath38 that is , twice smaller than the initial value .",
    "simulations are consistent with this result , but only at the leading part of the beam ( fig.[fig5-radius ] ) . also , the very head of the beam has a wider radius , as it has not reached the equilibrium during the simulated time period .     at different beam cross - sections characterized by the co - moving coordinate @xmath39 .",
    "]    the qualitative difference of equilibrium states for leading and trailing parts of the simulated bunch comes from the non - monotonic behavior of the potential well depth at the trailing part ( fig.[fig6-potential ] ) . for @xmath40 , the potential well first deepens at approximately the same time it takes for beam particles to reach the axis [ fig.[fig2-integrals](a ) ] and then becomes shallower .",
    "when moving towards the axis for the first time , particles gain a substantial transverse momentum , which results in large - amplitude oscillations in the shallower well [ fig.[fig3-amplitudes](a ) ] and large equilibrium radius of the beam [ fig.[fig1-beam](b ) , fig.[fig5-radius ] ] . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the potential well deepens monotonically , and the force that accelerates particles towards the axis never exceeds the force that slows them down at the opposite side .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the potential well depth follows from different beam pinching times at different cross - sections and from the quarter - period lag of the potential with respect to the beam [ see eq .  ] .",
    "the beam first pinches at the cross - section of strongest focusing , which is initially at @xmath42 for our test bunch [ fig.[fig7-compression](a ) ] .",
    "this increases the focusing force at @xmath40 [ fig.[fig7-compression](b ) ] .",
    "later , the upstream beam parts located at @xmath41 pinch [ fig.[fig7-compression](c),(d ) ] , and the deepest part of the potential well returns to its initial position thus causing shallowing of the well at @xmath40 .",
    "this backward - and - forward excursion of the potential minimum is possible only in regions of a negative derivative @xmath43 , that is , in the accelerating phase of the wakefield .",

    "because of the singular density behavior , it is more convenient to compare beam densities multiplied by @xmath45 . figure  [ fig8-density ] shows the simulated beam density at two cross - sections and the calculated radial distribution of the beam density .",
    "the agreement is quite good , except for short scale rippling observed at the simulated profiles because of incomplete phase mixing of transverse oscillations .     of transverse particle oscillations in the equilibrium as a function of the oscillation amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "half of the particles have oscillation amplitudes below the value indicated by the vertical dashed line . ]",
    "figure  [ fig9-frequency ] shows the frequency of particle betatron oscillations in equilibrium @xmath46 in comparison with the expression , where the period @xmath47 is calculated according to the formula .",
    "the difference in frequencies is so large that we use the logarithmic scale to show everything clearly .",
    "as most of the particles oscillate with amplitudes @xmath48 [ fig.[fig4-equilibrium](a ) ] , these particles also have oscillation frequencies several times higher than @xmath2 .    for calculating the normalized emittance @xmath49 of the equilibrium beam",

    "finally , @xmath62 the estimated emittance obtained by substituting the betatron frequency into the expression is 75% higher : @xmath63 the emittance calculated from the formula is shown in figure  [ fig10-emittance ] in comparison with simulations .",
    "the longitudinal dependence @xmath64 in may be either calculated with eq .  , or taken from simulations as the on - axis potential @xmath65 divided by calculated @xmath66 and constants [ see eq .  ] .",
    "both are in excellent agreement with the simulations .     at different radii . ]    to calculate the transverse momentum distributions of beam particles at some radius @xmath3 , we first need to relate the momentum @xmath51 that a particle has at this point and the initial oscillation amplitude of this particle @xmath26 . combining , , and , we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the inverse function to the well shape .",
    "the number fraction of particles that have the radial momentum between @xmath51 and @xmath69 is @xmath70 these particles spend the fraction @xmath71 of their time in the interval @xmath72 , with @xmath47 and @xmath73 determined by eqs .   and .",
    "thus , the momentum distribution is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a normalization constant . as follows from the derivation , for any radius @xmath3 the momentum scale of the distribution",
    "is determined by @xmath76 , while the distribution shape is different at different @xmath3 ( fig.[fig11-distfunc ] ) .",
    "note that the distribution is not gaussian , unlike sometimes assumed by default.@xcite in particular , the maximum transverse momentum of beam particles at a given @xmath3 is @xmath77",
    "an axisymmetric low - emittance charged particle beam in a dense plasma quickly reaches equilibrium with the wakefield it excites .",
    "decelerated parts of the beam evolves towards some universal equilibrium state that is derived and described in this paper . for accelerated parts of the beam",
    ", no universal equilibrium state is found yet .",
    "the universal equilibrium state is rather unusual .",
    "the beam density is strongly peaked near the axis and has a @xmath36 singularity .",
    "the radial electric field is approximately constant up to a small radius determined by the initial beam emittance .",
    "the beam radius is constant along the beam and equals approximately one half of the initial beam radius .",
    "the beam emittance varies along the beam in proportion to the square root of the potential well depth that confines beam particles radially .",
    "the frequency of transverse particle oscillations in this well strongly depends on the oscillation amplitude and , for most particles , is several times higher than the commonly used estimate .",
