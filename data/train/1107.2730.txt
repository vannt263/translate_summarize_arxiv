    "( [ eq:38a ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:39a ] ) , we obtain that radial time - like geodesics must satisfy @xmath213 the simplest solution is the worldline of a freely falling particle , which is @xmath214 . in terms of proper time we can describe it as @xmath215 eq .",
    "( [ eq:33a ] ) shows that the naked shell focusing singularity in 7d space - time occurs when the region of the collapsing dust is sufficiently small .",
    "moreover , as mentioned earlier , in @xmath0 space - time only the central singularity can be naked .",
    "hence , our purpose is to discuss the strength of the central singularity .",
    "we consider the expansion of @xmath216 near @xmath186 @xmath217 it specify that @xmath68 behaves as @xmath218 ( homogeneous case ) near the coordinate center , where @xmath219 is a function of @xmath6 and vanishes at @xmath220 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath221 clearly , @xmath222 thus we have @xmath223 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:001c ] ) , we obtain that @xmath224 where @xmath225 is defined as @xmath226 therefore has finite value . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:45a ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:46a ] ) we have @xmath227 the strong curvature condition eq .",
    "( [ eq:37a ] ) is not satisfied on the singularity near @xmath186 in the 7d space - time , while it is satisfied in the @xmath0 space - time .",
    "hence , the central shell focusing singularity is gravitational strong in the @xmath0 space - time and may be gravitational weak in the 7d space - time since we chosen a special solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:41a ] ) .",
    "the difference between two cases is that the singularity can be eternally visible in the 7d case while it is forbidden in the @xmath0 case .",
    "that is , the singularity is gravitational strong when the solution represents the black hole formation for arbitrary initial data .",
    "if a naked singularity is gravitational weak , it may not have any significant physical consequences so may not be a serious threat to the cch .",
    "thus , the naked singularity in the @xmath0 case violates the cch seriously , as in the general relativity @xcite@xcite , while the naked singularity may not be regarded as an essential counter example to the cch in the 7d case .",
    "nevertheless , such a central singularity in the 7d case is gravitational strong in the general relativistic and second order lovelock gravity . in the general relativistic limit @xmath228 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:37a ] ) takes the form @xmath229,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath230 thus , @xmath231 the strong curvature condition is satisfied in @xmath232 space - time . in second order lovelock gravity limit @xmath233",
    ", we find that @xmath234 the strong curvature condition is satisfied in @xmath235 space - time .",
    "these results indicate that the lovelock interaction weaken the strength of the singularity .",
    "moreover , a generic expression for @xmath190 order lovelock gravity could be @xmath236 it shows that the strong curvature condition is satisfied in @xmath237 space - time .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud in @xmath19 space - time in third order lovelock gravity without a cosmological constant . from field equations given by the third order lovelock action , we discussed the solutions of three families @xmath238 , @xmath239 and",
    "@xmath240 . we discussed the final fate of the collapse , and gave a condition for the formation of the shell focusing singularity .",
    "we also analysed the global structure of the space - time and gave the penrose diagram for the homogeneous case .",
    "it turns out that , the contribution of high order curvature corrections has a profound influence on the nature of the singularity , and the whole physical picture of the gravitational collapse changes drastically .",
    "high order lovelock terms alters the course of collapse and the time of formation of singularities , modifies apparent horizon formation and the location of apparent horizons , and changes the strength of singularities .",
    "the most attractive consequence is that an massive naked shell focusing singularity is inevitably formed in 7d space - time , which is quite different from that in the general relativity and in the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "however , as we shown , the strength of the naked singularity in 7d case is weaker than that in the general relativistic limit , therefore this may not be a serious threat to the cch . on the other hand , unlike the 7d case , there is a serious threat to the cch caused by the naked , gravitational strong singularity in the @xmath0 inhomogeneous collapse , thus the cch which is violated in general relativity could not be protected in lovelock gravity .",
    "when revising our paper in lines with reviewer s suggestions , we have received a paper by ohashi , shiromizu and jhingan@xcite discussing the gravitational collapse in the lovelock theory with arbitrary order which partially covers the result of present paper .",
    "in fact , they did not investigate the ingoing and outgoing properties of the singularity , the penrose diagram , and whether the condition of strong singularity is satisfied .",
    "one may study such properties in a general lovelock gravity similarly .",
