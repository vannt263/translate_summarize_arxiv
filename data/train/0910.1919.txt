    "we assume the electron temperature to be @xmath146  k in all hii  regions .",
    "there are three reasons for choosing this value .",
    "first , it is close to a temperature of about 11600  k that we determined from the oxygen line flux ratio in  hl111c .",

    "we did not average the abundances found from different spectra for the same hii  region , since they correspond to different slit positions on the nebula and could differ due to different physical conditions : the density and porosity of interstellar medium , loci of the radiation sources , etc .",

    "is given by lequeux et  al.(1979 ) , we can make the comparison only approximately .",
    "variations of the color excess that we revealed here for different galactic regions lie within the range 0.8 - 1.1 mag .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the difference from literature , where it ranges from @xmath150 = 0.47 mag to @xmath150 = 2.0 mag ( see sakai et  al .",

    "2003 ) found @xmath150 = 0.79  1.2 mag , which is similar to our estimates .",
    "variations of @xmath150 that we observed can be naturally explained by two factors .",
    "first , a local higher extinction is possible , since the brightest star - forming region is projected to the densest cloud of neutral hydrogen and molecular gas in the galaxy , and hence can be partly embedded into it .",
    "a similar effect was also observed by other authors . in particular , the extinction estimated by borissova et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) from the flux ratio of the br@xmath151 and h@xmath3 lines in the two brightest nebulae  hl111 and  hl45 is considerably higher than that found from stars .",
    "second , a local lower extinction is possible if the stellar wind and sn explosions in young groups sweep out the surrounding dense gas . in particular , in the central star - forming region vacca et  al .  (",
    "2007 ) found @xmath150 = 0.6 mag from massive blue stars and concluded that the young stars born in the last star formation episode are located at the front boundary of the above - mentioned dense cloud in front of the old stellar population .",
    "in this paper we present one of the most detailed studies of the oxygen , nitrogen , and sulfur abundances in ic  10 .",

    "only the upper abundance limit was estimated . as we see , all listed results are in a good agreement with our observations of hii regions in ic  10 .    as our measurements showed , the relative oxygen line intensities and , accordingly , the relative oxygen abundances vary in a wide range , from  7.6 to  8.5 . to understand whether it is related to the observational errors or to the actual differences between hii  regions",
    ", we presented the relative intensities found , respectively , for bright and faint objects in figs .",
    "4a and  4b .",
    "as follows from the figure , the measurement errors are slightly larger for the faint regions than that in the bright ones .",
    "however , the scatter of values in the faint regions does not exceed significantly that for the bright ones .",

    "4a and  4b , similar to other irr  galaxies investigated in detail , the diagnostic diagrams slightly differ between the bright and faint regions of  ic  10 : the relative intensities of [ sii ] lines are appreciably higher in faint regions as well as those of [ nii ] lines are also slightly higher , whereas @xmath162([oiii]@xmath173  )/@xmath162(h@xmath174 ) weakens in these regions",

    "the value of @xmath162([sii])/@xmath162(h@xmath3 ) in the bright compact hii  regions is lower than that in the faint diffuse and ring nebulae , not to mention the dig .",
    "the noted differences can be explained by a decrease in the ionization parameter when transiting from the compact to faint diffuse regions .",
    "this effect is predicted by photoionization models .",
    "the contribution from the gas emission behind the front of the shocks triggered by supernova explosions and stellar wind also leads to the same effect of the relative intensity @xmath162([sii])/@xmath162(h@xmath3 ) enhancement .",
    "the filamentary structure of the entire h@xmath3 emission region in the galaxy suggests that the shocks play a prominent role in ic  10 .",
    "it should be noted that the constructed diagnostic lines diagrams agree poorly with the currently available photoionization models for the metallicity @xmath175 found above from strong oxygen lines . in particular , the observed diagnostic diagrams are consistent with the families of theoretical diagnostic curves ( dopita et  al .",

    "as we see , the hii  regions in ic  10 fall nicely on the galaxy localization band but fall within the range of metallicities from @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "one distinctive region in ic  10 , the synchrotron superbubble , falls near @xmath184 .",
    "this object is discussed below .",
    "note , however , that asari et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) recorded a systematic shift by 0.2  dex between their metallicity estimates and those of pilyugin and thuan  ( 2005 ) and izotov et  al .",

    "it turns out that the lower the metallicity , the larger the shift .",
    "for this reason , asari et  al . adopted the metallicity @xmath175 for sector  a rather than @xmath182 and therefore @xmath175 is the lower boundary of the range into which our regions of ic  10 fall .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the observed diagnostic diagrams with the theoretical photoionization models by charlot and longhetti  ( 2001 ) , since these authors separately took into account the changes in each of the parameters defining the model calculations , such as the cluster age , the initial mass function ( imf ) , ionization parameter , density of interstellar medium , and metallicity .",

    "the differences between the metallicity of individual hii  regions in the galaxy found from the @xmath136 parameter and the metallicity determined by comparing diagnostic diagrams with theoretical photoionization models can be explained by a number of factors .",
    "first of all , the photoionization models are computed for rich star clusters .",
    "in particular , dopita et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) assumed a cluster mass of @xmath193 , the imf by miller and scalo ranges from  1 to @xmath194 , while the star clusters in  ic  10 are comparatively poor ( see hunter  2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the contribution from the gas emission behind the front of the shocks can be significant in ic  10 , as suggested by the filamentary structure of the entire star - forming region in this galaxy .",
    "actually , the term `` diffuse ionized gas ''  ( dig ) can be applied to ic  10 only conditionally , because the faint emission regions are characterized mostly as filamentary shell and/or arc structure .",
    "therefore , the faintest regions inside a number of shells that appear diffuse most likely represent the front or back sides of the shells .",
    "the synchrotron superbubble in ic  10 is a unique object and deserves a more detailed discussion .",
    "according to lozinskaya and moiseev  ( 2007 ) and lozinskaya et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the image in  [ sii ] lines better than in h@xmath3 reveals the optical shell identified with the synchrotron superbubble .",
    "the expansion velocity of the bright knots and filaments in the optical shell found in these papers , 5080  km  s@xmath195 , confirms the estimate by ramsey et  al .",
    "the gas mass is @xmath196 and the kinetic energy is @xmath197  erg .",
    "this amount of released energy corresponds to the explosions of ten supernovae plus the stellar wind from their host association .",
    "alternatively , the superbubble may be a result of a hypernova explosion , as was suggested by lozinskaya and moiseev  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the kinematic age of the superbubble , @xmath198 ( 3  7)@xmath199  yr , is a strong argument for a hypernova , because it takes more than @xmath200  yr for the explosions of ten supernovae in a local galactic region .    as it can be seen in fig .  1",

    "below we formally estimate the oxygen abundance in the synchrotron superbubble independently by two methods , realizing that both are improper . employing the @xmath136 parameter , we found the abundances @xmath215 from spectrogram  pa132 , @xmath216 from  pa0 , and @xmath217 from  pa331 using the technique of pilyugin and thuan  ( 2005 ) or , respectively , @xmath218 from spectrogram  pa132 , @xmath219 from  pa0 , and @xmath220 from  pa331 using the technique of izotov et  al .",

    "since the measurements were made for three different regions of a very faint extended object , these independent estimates of the oxygen abundance are in a very good agreement .",
    "a detailed kinematic study of the synchrotron superbubble ( lozinskaya et  al .  2008 ) clearly revealed weak h@xmath3 wings in the velocity range from  @xmath221 to @xmath222  km  s@xmath195 .",
    "these high - velocity features in the line correspond to the velocity of the shock wave triggered by a hypernova explosion of about 100200  km  s@xmath195 .",
    "comparison with the models of gas emission behind the front of a shock ( allen et  al .",

    "we present the most detailed to - date study of the o , n@xmath0 , and s@xmath0 abundances of the individual hii  regions and the synchrotron superbubble in the dwarf  irr  galaxy ic  10 that we estimated from five spectrograms taken with the scorpio instrument at the 6-m sao telescope .",
    "the relative  o , n@xmath0 , and s@xmath0 abundances in individual hii  regions of the galaxy ic  10 lie within the following ranges : @xmath135 = 7.59  8.52 , @xmath225 = 5.92  6.58 , and @xmath226 = 5.00  6.00 .",
    "the mean metallicity of the galaxy s gaseous medium is @xmath227 .",
    "the metallicity estimates from the comparison of diagnostic diagrams with photoionization models are found to be less reliable than those from the strong oxygen line ratios .",
    "the oxygen abundance estimates in the synchrotron superbubble from the measured relative line intensities must be based on the model of the combined action of a shock ( the result of a hypernova explosion ) and ionizing radiation ( the presence of a wr star in the central region ) .",
    "so far the estimates have been made separately within the framework of these two models . with the model of an hii  region , we found that @xmath2287.59  8.34 .",
    "the comparison with the models of gas emission behind the front of a shock propagating with the velocity of 100200  km  s@xmath195 gives the best agreement at the abundance @xmath223 with the models of purely collisional excitation or @xmath229 for the models that include the gas pre - ionization by a shock .",
