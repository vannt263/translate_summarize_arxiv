    "there has been growing evidence linking long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; in this study , we consider only long grbs , so we refer to long grbs as grbs hereafter for simplicity ) to the death of massive stars .",
    "the host galaxies of grbs are star - forming galaxies and the positions of grbs appear to trace the blue light of young stars  @xcite .",
    "also , bumps observed in some afterglows can be naturally explained as contribution of bright supernovae  @xcite .",
    "moreover , direct evidence of some grbs accompanied by supernovae have been reported such as the association of grb 980425 with sn 1998bw  @xcite , that of grb 030329 with sn 2003dh  @xcite , and that of grb 060218 and sn 2006aj  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these supernovae ( except for sn 2006aj ) are categorized as a new type of supernovae with large kinetic energy ( @xmath6 ergs ) , nickel mass ( @xmath7 ) , and luminosity  @xcite , so these supernovae are sometimes called hypernovae .",
    "the total explosion energy of the order of @xmath8 erg is too important to be emphasized , because it is generally considered that a normal core - collapse supernova can not cause such an energetic explosion .",
    "thus another scenario has to be considered to explain the system of a grb associated with a hypernova .",
    "one of the most promising scenarios is the collapsar scenario  @xcite . in the collapsar scenario ,",
    "a black hole is formed as a result of gravitational collapse .",
    "also , rotation of the progenitor plays an essential role . due to the rotation",
    ", an accretion disk is formed around the equatorial plane . on the other hand , the matter around the rotation axis freely falls into the black hole .",
    "macfadyen and woosley ( 1999 ) pointed out that the jet - induced explosion along the rotation axis may occur due to the heating through neutrino anti - neutrino pair annihilation that are emitted from the accretion disk ( see also fryer and m@xmath9sz@xmath10ros 2000 ) .",
    "it is true that the collapsar scenario is the breakthrough on the problem of the central engine of grbs .",
    "however , there are many effects that have to be involved in order to establish the scenario firmly .",
    "first of all , neutrino heating effects have to be investigated carefully by including microphysics of neutrino processes in the numerical simulations .",
    "it is true that macfadyen and woosley ( 1999 ) have done the numerical simulations of the collapsar , in which a jet is launched along the rotation axis , but detailed microphysics of neutrino heating is not included in their simulations .",
    "secondly , it was pointed out that effects of magnetic fields and rotation may play an important role to launch the grb jets  @xcite , although neutrino heating effects are not included in their works .",
    "recently , rockefeller et al ( 2006 ) presented 3-dimensional simulations of collapsars with smoothed particle hydrodynamics code . in their study",
    ", 3-flavor flux - limited diffusion package is used to take into account neutrino cooling and absorption of electron - type neutrinos , although neutrino anti - neutrino pair annihilation is not included .",
    "they have shown that alpha - viscosity drives energetic explosion through 3-dimensional instabilities and angular momentum transfer , although the jet is not launched and magnetic fields ( source of the viscosity ) are not included in their study .",
    "thus it is not clear which effects are most important to launch a grb jet , that is , what process is essential as the central engine of grbs .    due to the motivation mentioned above ,",
    "we have performed two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars with magnetic fields , rotation , and neutrino cooling / heating processes . in our simulations , the realistic equation of state ( eos ) of blinnikov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and effects of photo - disintegration of nuclei are also included .",
    "we investigated influence of magnetic fields on the dynamics of collapsars by changing initial amplitude of the magnetic fields .",
    "in section  [ method ] , models and numerical methods are explained .",
    "results are shown in section  [ results ] .",
    "discussions are described in  [ discussions ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "our models and numerical methods of simulations in this study are shown in this section .",
    "first we present equations of ideal mhd , then initial and boundary conditions are explained . micro physics included in this study ( equation of state ( eos ) , nuclear reactions , and neutrino processes ) is also explained .",
    "we have done two - dimensional mhd simulations taking account of self - gravity and gravitational potential of the central point mass .",
    "the calculated region corresponds to a quarter of the meridian plane under the assumption of axisymmetry and equatorial symmetry .",
    "the spherical mesh with 150(@xmath4)@xmath11 30(@xmath12 ) grid points is used for all the computations .",
    "the radial grid is nonuniform , extending from @xmath131.0@xmath14 to 1.0@xmath15 cm with finer grids near the center , while the polar grid is uniform .",
    "the minimum radial grid is set to be 3.0@xmath16 cm .",
    "we have confirmed that a free flow is smoothly solved with this grid resolution .",
    "the basic equations in the following form are finite differenced on the spherical coordinates : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , and are density , velocity , pressure , gravitational potential due to the central point mass ( black hole ) , gravitational potential due to self gravity , internal energy density , heating / cooling rates due to neutrino processes , energy gain ( loss ) rate due to nuclear reaction , fraction of electron , proton , neutron , and reaction rate from proton to neutron ( electron capture rate plus @xmath3 capture on neutron ) and from neutron to proton ( positron capture plus @xmath31 capture on proton ) , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian derivative is denoted as @xmath32 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the black hole is modified to take into account some of the general relativistic effects  @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the schwartzshild radius .",
    "self - gravity is obtained in zeus-2d code developed by stone and norman ( 1992a , b ) , by solving the matrix which results from finite - differencing the poisson equation in two dimension .",
    "the zeus-2d code is also used to solve the mhd equations with second order accurate interpolation in space .",
    "energy gain ( loss ) rate due to nuclear reaction and heating / cooling rates due to neutrino processes are described in subsections  [ nucl ] and  [ neutrino ] .",
    "effects of @xmath35-viscosity and ( anomalous ) resistivity are not included in this study to avoid the uncertainty of the treatment of these effects .",
    "we adopt the model e25 in heger et al .",
    "this model corresponds to a star that has 25@xmath36 initially with solar metallicity , but loses its mass and becomes to be 5.45@xmath36 of a wolf - rayet star at the final stage .",
    "this model seems to be a good candidate as a progenitor of a grb since losing their envelope will be suitable to be a type ic - like supernova and to make a baryon poor fireball .",
    "the mass of the iron core is 1.69@xmath36 in this model .",
    "thus we assume that the iron core has collapsed and formed a black hole at the center .",
    "this treatment is same with proga et al .",
    "the schwartzshild radius of the black hole is 5.0@xmath37 cm initially .",
    "we explain how the angular momentum is distributed initially . at first",
    ", we performed 1-d simulation for the spherical collapse of the progenitor for 0.1 s when the inner most si - layer falls to the inner most boundary ( = @xmath38 cm ) .",
    "after the spherical collapse , angular momentum was distributed so as to provide a constant ratio of 0.05 of centrifugal force to the component of gravitational force perpendicular to the rotation axis at all angles and radii , except where that prescription resulted in @xmath39 greater than a prescribed maximum value , 10 .",
    "this treatment is similar to the one in macfadyen and woosley ( 1999 ) .",
    "the total initial rotation energy is @xmath40 erg that corresponds to @xmath41 for initial ratio of the rotation energy to the gravitational energy ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "configuration and amplitude of the magnetic fields in a progenitor prior to collapse are still uncertain .",
    "thus in this study we choose a simple form for the initial configuration prior to collapse and the amplitude is changed parametrically .",
    "initial configuration of the magnetic fields is chosen as follows : @xmath43 this configuration represents that the magnetic fields are uniform in a sphere @xmath44 , while dipole at outside of the sphere .",
    "we set @xmath45 to be the boundary between co core / he layer (= @xmath46 cm ) .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to the strength of the magnetic field in the sphere .",
    "we have chosen @xmath47 to be 0 , @xmath48 g , @xmath49 g , @xmath50 g , @xmath51 g , and @xmath52 g .",
    "as for the boundary condition in the radial direction , we adopt the outflow boundary condition for the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "that is , the flow from the central black hole is prohibited at the inner boundary and the inflow from the surface of the progenitor is prohibited at the outer boundary .",
    "of course , the mass of the central black hole becomes larger due to the mass accretion from the inner boundary .",
    "as for the boundary condition in the zenith angle direction , axis of symmetry boundary condition is adopted for the rotation axis , while the reflecting boundary condition is adopted for the equatorial plane . as for the magnetic fields , the equatorial symmetry boundary condition , in which the normal component is continuous and",
    "the tangential component is reflected , is adopted .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) used in this study is the one developed by blinnikov et al .",
    "this eos contains an electron - positron gas with arbitrary degeneracy , which is in thermal equilibrium with blackbody radiation and ideal gas of nuclei .",
    "we used the mean atomic weight of nuclei to estimate the ideal gas contribution to the total pressure , although its contribution is negligible relative to those of electron - positron gas and thermal radiation in our simulations .",
    "although the ideal gas contribution of nuclei to the total pressure is negligible , effects of energy gain / loss due to nuclear reactions are important . in this study , nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse )",
    "was assumed for the region where @xmath53 [ k ] is satisfied .",
    "this treatment is based on the assumption that the timescale to reach and maintain nse is much shorter than the hydrodynamical time .",
    "note that complete si - burning occurs in explosive nucleosynthesis of core - collapse supernovae for the region @xmath54 [ k ]  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical time in this study , @xmath55 ( as shown in figs  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] , and  [ fig10 ] , the nuclear reaction occurs at @xmath56 cm where the radial velocity is of the order of @xmath57 cm s@xmath58 ) , is comparable to the explosive nucleosynthesis in core - collapse supernovae , so the assumption of nse adopted in this study seems to be well .",
    "5 nuclei , @xmath59 , and @xmath2 were used to estimate the binding energy of ideal gas of nuclei in nse for given ( @xmath18 , @xmath60 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is electron fraction that is obtained from the calculations of neutrino processes in section  [ neutrino ] . on the other hand",
    ", we assumed that no nuclear reaction occurs for the region where @xmath61 [ k ] .",
    "neutrino cooling processes due to pair capture on free nucleons , pair annihilation , and plasmon decay are included in this study .",
    "since photoneutrino and bremsstrahlung processes are less important ones at @xmath62 [ k ] and @xmath63 [ g @xmath64  @xcite where neutrino cooling effects are important in our calculations , we do not include these processes .",
    "as for the electron capture on free proton , we extend the formulation of epstein and pethick ( 1981 ) to arbitrary degeneracy .",
    "the energy loss rate per proton @xmath65 [ gev s@xmath58 proton@xmath58 ] is @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( in units of gev@xmath68 ) is the fermi coupling constant ( @xmath69 is the cabbibo angle ) , @xmath70 is the vector coupling constant ( @xmath71 is the weinberg angle ) , @xmath72 is the axial - vector coupling constant , @xmath73 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath74 is mass difference between neutron and proton .",

    "we also include the fermi blocking factor  @xcite due to @xmath3 assuming that the chemical potential of @xmath3 is zero and mean energy of the emitted neutrinos by this process is @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "all we have to do is to change @xmath79 to -@xmath79 and @xmath84 to -@xmath84 to estimate the positron capture on free neutron . as for",
    "the plasmon decays , we used the formulation of itoh et al .",

    "neutrino leakage scheme is introduced  @xcite . in this scheme , we calculate typical diffusion timescale for neutrinos to escape from the system . since chemical composition is dominated by nucleons at such a high density region , the opacity is mainly determined by scattering and absorption by nucleons for @xmath3 and @xmath31 and scattering by nucleons for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",

    "the diffusion timescale is given by @xmath102 where we take @xmath103 as the typical diffusion length .",

    "on the other hand , when we estimate the neutrino heating rate , we take optically thin limit for all the regions for simplicity .",
    "this corresponds to that we estimate the upper limit for the neutrino heating effects .",
    "even this limit , as shown later , jet like explosion does not occur by the neutrino heating ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "also , this optically thin limit will be justified since neutrino cooling rate dominates heating rate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . detailed discussion on this point is presented in section  [ neutrino - dis ] .",
    "neutrino heating process due to neutrino pair annihilation and @xmath3 and @xmath31 captures on free nucleons with blocking factors of electrons and positrons are included in this study . as for the neutrino pair annihilation process , the formulation of goodman et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( with blocking factors ) is adopted .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath31 captures on free nucleons are inverse processes of electron / positron captures .",
    "the calculation of neutrino heating is the most expensive in the simulation of this study .",
    "thus , to save the cpu time , the neutrino heating processes are calculated only within the limited regions ( @xmath110 cm ) .",

    "of course this treatment has to be improved in the future .",
    "however , this treatment seems to be justified as follows : the total time step is of the order of @xmath38 steps .",
    "the final physical time is of the order of seconds , so the typical time step is @xmath115 s. this means that heating rate is updated every @xmath116 s , which will be shorter than the typical dynamical timescale .",

    "let points a and b be in the emission regions and a point c be in the energy deposition regions .",
    "let @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 be distances between a and b , b and c , and c and a , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath120 is defined as the angle acb .",

    "it is easily seen that eq .",
    "( [ eq : anni ] ) is eight dimensional integral and it takes too much time to accomplish this integral .",
    "thus we have approximated that each neutrino energy spectrum due to each emission process is a monotonic one , that is , we assumed only neutrinos with average energy are emitted when eq .",
    "( [ eq : anni ] ) is carried out . since the energy loss rate [ gev @xmath89 s@xmath58 ]",
    "is obtained from the formulations of neutrino cooling process mentioned above , number of emitted neutrinos for each process is calculated by dividing the average energy of emitted neutrinos for the process . although the calculated region is a quarter of the meridian plane , the neutrino flux from the south hemisphere is included assuming the symmetry relative to the equatorial plane . the same treatment with neutrino pair annihilation process is adopted to estimate the heating rate due to @xmath3 and @xmath31 capture processes ,",
    "that is , average energy of ( anti-)electron - type neutrinos is used .",
    "neutrinos are emitted isotropically in the fluid - rest frame , so strictly speaking , neutrinos are emitted unisotropically in the coordinate system due to the beaming effect  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the angular frequency is found to become as large as @xmath135 s@xmath58 at the inner most region ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig10 ] ) and the rotation velocity , @xmath136 reaches @xmath137 cm s@xmath58 at most . thus the beaming effect may be important although we did not take into account the effect in this study .",
    "finally the models considered in this study are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "[ fig6 ] and  [ fig9 ]",
    ". however , for further study , we have to investigate the cases in which mass accretion rate is higher than in this study to achieve energetic explosion enough to explain the explosion energies of a hypernova and a grb .",
    "in fact , we consider that the optically thin limit breaks down even the models in this study at the highest density region .",
    "this is estimated as follows : the cross section of @xmath3 and @xmath31 captures on free nucleons is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 @xmath168 .",
    "since the highest density in the accretion disk is of the order of @xmath52 g @xmath89 at @xmath202 cm ( the scale hight is also of the order of @xmath38 cm ) and typical energy of neutrinos are of the order of 10 mev ( see figs .",

    "[ fig8](b ) , as stated in section  [ withmag ] , the energy deposition rate due to pair captures on free nucleon sometimes becomes larger than the neutrino luminosity .",

    "although we believe that our conclusion on the energetics will not be changed so much , we are planning to develop the careful neutrino transfer code that includes emissions , absorptions , and scattering of neutrinos for further study .",
    "we also note four points that have to be improved for the treatments of neutrino heating .",
    "one is that we did not take into account the light - crossing time of the system and assumed that the system is almost steady during the light - crossing time when we estimate the neutrino heating rate . from figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig7 ] , the neutrino cooling and heating occur efficiently within several times of @xmath204 cm .",
    "thus the typical light crossing time will be of the order of 1ms . for comparison ,",
    "the rotation period at the inner most region is @xmath205 s. since the system forms an accretion disk and the viscosity parameter @xmath35 is 0.1 at most ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) , the system will be treated steady at least ten times of the rotation period , @xmath206 s. thus the treatment to neglect the light crossing time will be fairly justified .",
    "second is that we update the neutrino heating rate every 100 timesteps to save the cpu time .",
    "the inner most radius is set to be @xmath38 cm , so the typical time step is estimated to be @xmath207 s , where @xmath208 is the speed of light and @xmath209 .",
    "thus 100 time steps corresponds to @xmath210 s , which will be comparable to free - fall timescale ( @xmath211 s  @xcite ) and rotation period . thus we believe that this treatment will be fairly justified .",
    "third , we have approximated that each neutrino energy spectrum due to each emission process is monotonic , that is , we assumed only neutrinos with average energy are emitted when eq .",
    "( [ eq : anni ] ) is carried out . however , the cross section of neutrino pair annihilation is proportional to square of the total energy in the center of mass , and that for electron - type neutrino absorption on free nucleons is proportional to square of neutrino s energy .",
    "thus the contribution of neutrinos with high energy will enhance the efficiency of neutrino heating .",
    "these points will be improved when we can include a careful neutrino transfer code in future .",
    "the last point is related with the nuclear reactions . in this study ,",
    "the nse was assumed for the region where @xmath53 [ k ] .",
    "thus , the reactions to maintain nse occur suddenly when the temperature becomes so high as to satisfy the criterion . however , in reality",
    ", nse might break down at low density region , where cooling effect due to photo - disintegration will be not so strong as in this simulation .",
    "it should be also noted that the photo - dissociation from he into nucleons is strong cooling effect and absorb thermal energy when this reaction is switched on .",
    "thus the thermal energy suddenly absorbed by nuclear reactions .",
    "that is seen as the discontinuities of temperature in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig10 ] .",
    "although we believe these discontinuities do not change our conclusion on the energetics mentioned above ( because much more neutrinos come from the inner region ; fig .  [ fig5 ] ) , the profile of temperature will be solved smoothly when we use a nuclear reaction network instead of using the nse relation .",
    "since the emissivity of neutrinos depends very sensitively on the temperature  @xcite , estimation of temperature should be treated carefully .",
    "we are planning to check the dependence of temperature on the nuclear reaction network and several eos in the forth coming paper .",
    "finally , we discuss the detectability of neutrinos from collapsars .",
    "since the event rate is much smaller than the normal core - collapse supernova , the chance probability to detect neutrino signals from a collapsar will be very small .",
    "however , if it occurs nearby our galaxy , the neutrino signal from a collapsar will be distinguished from normal core - collapse supernova . as for the normal core - collapse supernovae",
    ", the time evolution of the luminosity of neutrino of each flavor is determined firmly by the binding energy of a neutron star and opacity of neutron star against neutrinos . on the other hand , in the case of a collapsar ,",
    "the time evolution of neutrino luminosity will depend on the time evolution of mass accretion rate , which in turn should depend on the initial distribution of angular momentum and magnetic fields .",
    "thus there should be much varieties of time evolution for the luminosity of neutrinos in the case of collapsars . also , in the case of collapsars , the dominant process to generate neutrinos",
    "is pair captures on free nucleons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , so in the case of a collapsar , the electron - type neutrinos will be much more produced compared with other flavors .",
    "this is in contrast with the normal core - collapse supernovae(e.g .",
    "buras et al .",
    "2006 , and see references therein ) .",
    "of course , we have to take vacuum and matter oscillation effects into account to estimate the spectrum of neutrinos from a collapsar precisely .",
    "in particular , in the case of a collapsar , the density distribution is far from spherically symmetric , so we have to be careful about viewing angle to estimate the matter oscillation effect .",
    "it is true that the event rate of collapsars is smaller than normal core collapse supernovae , but the released gravitational energy can be larger if considerable amount of mass of the progenitor falls into the central black hole  @xcite .",
    "thus we consider that there will be also a possibility to detect a neutrino background from collapsars .",
    "we have seen that the mass accretion rate seems to be enhanced in model 9 , compared with model 0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which enhances the luminosity of neutrinos ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) and energy deposition rate due to weak interactions ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this seems to be because magnetic viscosity is effective at inner most region ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) and multi - dimensional outflow ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) carries angular momentum outward .",
    "thus amplification of magnetic fields is important not only for launching a jet by magnetic pressure , but also for enhancing mass accretion rate and energy deposition rate through weak interactions . in our study",
    ", we assume the axisymmetry of the system to save cpu time . in this case",
    ", the field built up by the effect of magnetorotational instability ( mri ) decays due to cowling s anti - dynamo theorem  @xcite .",
    "however , the plasma beta becomes lower than unity in the jet region ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) , which is embodied by the amplification of @xmath0 fields ( figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "thus we consider that @xmath0 field is not amplified by mri effects , but by winding - up of poloidal fields due to differential rotation .",
    "the typical timescale of winding - up at the inner most region will be ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig10 ] ) @xmath212 this timescale will correspond to the steep rising of energy of @xmath0 around @xmath173 s in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and  [ fig15 ] . after the steep growth , when the strength of @xmath159 becomes comparable to the poloidal component , the growth rate declines since @xmath159 grows by winding the weak poloidal component  @xcite .",
    "the final time of the simulation is determined when the alfvn speed reaches to the order of the speed of light .",
    "this is understood as follows : alfvn crossing time in the @xmath12-direction at the innermost region becomes @xmath213s .",
    "since the total timestep is several times of @xmath38 , the final time is estimated to be several time , which is consistent with our results .",
    "the alfvn speed is estimated to be @xmath214 which means that the final time is determined not by the time when the amplitude of @xmath0 reaches to @xmath179 g around the equatorial plane , but by the time when the amplitude of @xmath0 reaches to @xmath179 g at low density region , that is , around the polar region where the jet is launched .    as for @xmath161 and @xmath162 fields , from fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , some instabilities seem to grow and saturate , which is similar to the behavior of mri  @xcite . at present , we consider that these instabilities are mri modes with a wavelength of maximum growth mode unresolved .",
    "however , we can not conclude that these instabilities are really unresolved mri modes .",
    "this is due to the reason as follows : the dispersion relation of the linear mri modes is obtained analytically by assuming that the accretion disk is supported by rotation ( that is , in kepler motion ) . on the other hand , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig10 ] , the radial velocity is non - zero in the accretion disks in this study .",
    "moreover , the radial flow speed is super - slow magnetosonic ( the speed of slow magnetosonic wave is almost same with that of alfvn wave in this study : fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "since mri is the instability of the slow - magnetosonic waves in a magnetized and differentially rotation plasma , the dispersion relation may be changed considerably for such a super - slow magnetosonic flow .",
    "however , there is no analytic solution for such a flow at present , so we use the dispersion relation of mri for the discussion here .",
    "ignoring entropy gradients , the condition for the instability of the slow - magnetosonic waves in a magnetized , differentially rotation plasma is  @xcite @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the vector of the wave number .",
    "the wavelength of maximum growth of the linear instability is @xmath217 since @xmath218 is much smaller than the grid size of the inner most region ( @xmath219 cm ) , the linear mri mode of maximum growth is not resolved in this study ( note that the amplitudes of @xmath161 and @xmath162 are of the order of @xmath220 g and much smaller than @xmath0 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "however , mri grows as long as eq .",
    "( [ dis : b-3 ] ) holds . since the value of the first term of eq .",
    "( [ dis : b-3 ] ) at the inner most region is @xmath221 , it is confirmed that inner most region is unstable for mri mode with the wave length longer than @xmath222 cm .",
    "the characteristic growing timescale is  @xcite @xmath223 which is seen in model 9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) and model 8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) .",
    "the saturation level of @xmath161 seems to be slightly higher than that of @xmath171 , which is similar to the results of the local simulations of mri  @xcite .",
    "also , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , the growth rate of @xmath174 and @xmath171 components depends on the grid resolution , while the growth rate of @xmath159 does not depend on the grid resolution .",
    "in fact , the growth rate becomes smaller for a coarse mesh case ( fig .",
    "[ fig16](a ) ) .",
    "this is similar to the picture that @xmath174 and @xmath171 are amplified by mri , while @xmath159 is amplified by winding effect .",
    "the saturation level of @xmath174 and @xmath171 seems not to be sensitive to the grid resolution . as stated above , in order to prove firmly that @xmath174 and @xmath171 are amplified by mri - like instability , dispersion relation of linear growing modes for super - slow magnetosonic flow has to be obtained analytically and the dispersion relation has to be reproduced by numerical simulations with finer grid resolution , which is outscope of this study .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the estimated viscosity parameter becomes larger than @xmath158 at almost all region in @xmath224 cm . since the angular velocity becomes larger than @xmath225 for @xmath226 cm ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , this viscosity becomes effective in a timescale of second , which is comparable to our simulations .",
    "thus we think this viscosity drives high mass accretion rate in the models with magnetic fields .",
    "however , as stated in section  [ withmag ] , the angular momentum can not be transfered to infinity along the radial direction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the flow is super - alfvnic except for the inner most region .",
    "thus angular momentum can not be conveyed outward by alfvn wave in the radial direction . at present",
    ", we consider that the outflow ( including the jet ) in the polar direction in model 9 should bring the angular momentum from the inner most region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] bottom ) .",
    "this picture is similar to cdaf  @xcite .",
    "we are planning to present further analysis of this feature in the forth - coming paper .    since the plasma beta can be of the order of unity at the inner most region ( fig .  [ fig14 ] ) and",
    "@xmath0 dominates @xmath161 and @xmath162 at the region ( @xmath227 cm ) , we can understand that the magnetic pressure from @xmath161 and @xmath162 is much smaller than the radiation pressure ( from photons , electrons , and positrons ) and degenerate pressure .",
    "thus , the jet can not be launched by the effects of @xmath161 and @xmath162 only .",
    "the winding - up effect is necessary to amplify @xmath0 field so that the magnetic pressure becomes comparable to the radiation and degenerate pressure .",
    "we saw that mri - like instability seems to occur from the beginning of the simulations ( see model 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) .",
    "however , since the saturation level is not so high , the amplified energy of magnetic fields for @xmath161 and @xmath162 can not be seen well at first ( see model 9 in fig .  [ fig13 ] and model 10 in fig .  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "this is because at the early phase the steady accretion disk is not formed and released gravitational energy is not so much ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . in model 11 and model 12 ,",
    "the initial total energies of magnetic fields are so high that the effect of mri - like instability can not be seen ( fig .  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "as stated above , the axisymmetry of the system is assumed in this study . so winding up effect only amplifies @xmath228 mode of @xmath0 .",
    "usually , it is pointed out that saturation level of the winding up effects becomes lower when three dimensional simulations are performed  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath0 may not be amplified as strong as @xmath179 g .",
    "also , at the present study , the timescale for @xmath0 fields at the inner most region to be amplified to @xmath229 g depends on the initial amplitude of the magnetic fields ( see figs .  [ fig13 ] and  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "however , if three dimensional simulations are performed , instabilities due to mri(-like ) modes do not decay due to cowling s anti - dynamo theorem .",
    "also , the mri(-like ) modes with wave vectors whose @xmath230 components are non - zero , which amplify @xmath0 are included  @xcite .",
    "if such mri(-like ) modes that amplify @xmath0 are included , the dependence of the dynamics on the initial amplitude of the magnetic fields may be diluted .",
    "we have to perform three dimensional calculations to see what happens in more realistic situations .",
    "as stated above , the timestep becomes so small when the alfvn crossing time becomes so small .",
    "since this calculation is newtonian , the speed of light is not included in the basic equations for macro physics ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic0])-eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic1 ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , we found that the alfvn speed becomes larger than the speed of light at some points by a factor of two or so at the final stage of simulations .",
    "thus it will be one of the solutions to overcome this problem is to develop the special relativistic mhd code , in which the alfvn speed is , of course , solved to be smaller than the speed of light .    in this study",
    ", we considered the ideal mhd without dissipation ( it is , of course , numerical viscosity is inevitably included due to finite gridding effects ) .",
    "when resistive heating is efficient , considerable amount of energy in magnetic fields will be transfered to thermal energy by ohmic - like dissipation and reconnection , which will change the dynamics of collapsars so much .",
    "the problem is , however , that the properties of resistivity of high density and high temperature matter with strong magnetic fields are highly uncertain ( it is noted that artificial resistivity is included in proga et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in order to account of the dissipation in a controlled way instead of allowing numerical effects to dissipate magnetic fields in an uncontrolled manner ( see also stone and pringle 2001 ) ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the total explosion energy and bulk lorentz factor of the jet . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , we can see that there seems to be a tendency that the mass of the jet becomes heavier when the initial amplitude of the magnetic fields are stronger ( model 10 , model 11 , and model 12 ) , although this tendency is not monotonic ( model 8 and model 9 ) .",
    "this will reflect that the jet is launched earlier and the density is still higher for a case with stronger initial magnetic fields .",
    "there seems to be also tendency that the energy of the jet becomes also larger when the initial amplitude of the magnetic fields is set to be stronger , although this tendency is not also monotonic ( model 8 and model 9 ) .",
    "this tendency is not so remarkable since the mass of the jet is heavier for a stronger magnetic field case and the mass should have some amount of kinetic , thermal , and magnetic field energies . as for the models",
    "8 and 9 , the information of initial condition might be lost considerably since it takes much time to launch jets . from these results",
    ", we can conclude that no grb jet is realized even if strong magnetic fields is assumed .",
    "we consider that there will be a possibility that a grb jet is realized if we can perform numerical simulations for much longer physical time ( say , @xmath1s ) . in such long timescale simulations ,",
    "the energy of @xmath159 fields should be much more than @xmath170 erg ( see figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "also , the density in the jet may become lower along with time , because considerable mass will falls into the black hole along the polar axis .",
    "thus the terminal bulk lorentz factor may be enhanced at later phase . in order to achieve such a simulation , the special relativistic code will be helpful , as mentioned above .",
    "it is radioactive nuclei , @xmath2 and its daughter nuclei , @xmath231 , that brighten the supernova remnant and determine its bolometric luminosity .",
    "@xmath2 is considered to be synthesized through explosive nucleosynthesis because its half - life is very short ( 5.9 days ) .",
    "thus it is natural to consider that explosive nucleosynthesis occurs in a hypernova that is accompanied by a grb .",
    "however , it is not clearly known where the explosive nucleosynthesis occurs ( e.g. fryer et al",
    ". 2006a , fryer et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "maeda et al . (",
    "2002 ) have done a numerical calculation of explosive nucleosynthesis launching a jet by depositing thermal and kinetic energy at the inner most region .",
    "they have shown that a mass of @xmath2 sufficient to explain the observation of hypernovae ( @xmath232 ) can be synthesized around the jet region . in their calculation , all the explosion energy was deposited initially .",
    "thus nagataki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) investigated the dependence of explosive nucleosynthesis on the energy deposition rate .",
    "they have shown that sufficient mass of @xmath2 can be synthesized as long as all the explosion energy is deposited initially , while the synthesized mass of @xmath2 is insufficient if the explosion energy is deposited for 10 s ( that is , the energy deposition rate is @xmath233 erg s@xmath58 ) .",
    "this is because matter starts to move outward after the passage of the shock wave , and almost all of the matter moves away from the central engine before the injection of thermal energy (= @xmath8 erg ) is completed , so the amount of mass where complete burning to synthesize @xmath2 becomes little for such a long - duration explosion ( see also nagataki et al ( 2003 ) ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is pointed out the possibility that a substantial amount of @xmath2 is produced in the accretion disk and a part of it is conveyed outward by the viscosity - driven wind by some authors  @xcite .",
    "however , there is much uncertainty how much @xmath2 is ejected from the accretion disk .",
    "this problem depends sensitively on the viscosity effects .",
    "further investigation is required to estimate how much @xmath2 is ejected .    in this study , we have found that mass of @xmath2 in the accretion disk ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) at the final stage of simulations is of the order of @xmath234 ( @xmath190 in table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "thus if considerable fraction of the synthesized @xmath2 is ejected without falling into the black hole , there will be a possibility to supply sufficient amount of @xmath2 required to explain the luminosity of a hypernova .",
    "however , in the present study , the ejected mass of @xmath2 was found to be only @xmath235 ( @xmath189 in table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "this is because the entropy per baryon in the jet is so high ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) that the light elements such as @xmath191 , @xmath20 , and he dominate in the jet . thus we could not show that sufficient mass of @xmath2 was ejected from the accretion disk in the present study .",
    "there will be two possibilities to extract enough amount of @xmath2 from the accretion disk .",
    "one is that @xmath2 might be extracted efficiently from the accretion disk at later phase . since typical temperature of the accretion disk",
    "will be lower when the mass of the central black hole becomes larger , the entropy per baryon in the jet will be decreased  @xcite .",
    "this feature should suggest that @xmath2 dominates in the jet component at the late phase .",
    "the other one is that some kinds of viscosities might work to convey the matter in the accretion disk outward efficiently . in macfadyen and woosley ( 1999 ) , they included @xmath35-viscosity and showed that considerable amount can be conveyed . since @xmath35 viscosity is not included in this study , such a feature was not seen .",
    "however , when three dimensional simulations with higher resolution than in this study are done , much more modes of magnetic fields should be resolved , and some of them might be responsible for viscosities and work like @xmath35-viscosity .",
    "we discuss the possibility to synthesize heavy elements in collapsars .",
    "we have shown that neutron - rich matter with high entropy per baryon is ejected along the jet axis ( figs .",
    "[ fig17 ] and  [ fig18 ] ) .",
    "this is because electron capture dominates positron capture in the accretion disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus there is a possibility that r - process nucleosynthesis occurs in the jet  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that mass element with high @xmath26 ( @xmath236 ) appears around the polar axis near the black hole .",
    "this is because @xmath3 capture dominates @xmath31 capture at the region .",
    "this is because flux of @xmath3 from the accretion disk ( note that @xmath3 comes from electron capture ) is sufficiently large to enhance @xmath195 at the region .",
    "in such a high @xmath195 region , there will be a possibility that @xmath5process nucleosynthesis occurs  @xcite .",
    "we are planning to perform such a numerical simulations in the very near future .",
    "also , there is a possibility that much neutrons are ejected from the jet since the entropy per baryon amounts to the order of @xmath135 .",
    "if so , there may be a possibility that signals from the neutron decays may be observed as the delayed bump of the light curve of the afterglow  @xcite or gamma - rays  @xcite .",
    "also , gev emission may be observed by proton - neutron inelastic scattering  @xcite finally , note that a careful treatment of neutrino transfer is important for the r- and r / p - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "as stated in section  [ neutrino - dis ] , the optically thin limit may break down at the high density region .",
    "when the matter becomes to be opaque to neutrinos , the neutrinos becomes to be trapped and degenerate . in the high density limit ,",
    "the chemical equilibrium is achieved as @xmath237 where @xmath79 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 are chemical potentials of electrons , protons , neutrons , and electron - type neutrinos .",
    "when the chemical potential of electron - type neutrinos is not negligible , the electron capture do not proceed further and electron fraction does not decrease so much  @xcite , which should be crucial to the r- and r / p - process nucleosynthesis .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss general relativistic effects that we are planning to include in our magnetohydrodynamic simulation code .",
    "first , we still believe that effects of energy deposition due to weak interactions ( especially , neutrino anti - neutrino pair annihilation ) can be a key process as the central engine of grbs .",
    "in fact , the temperature of the accretion disk becomes higher especially for a kerr black hole since the gravitational potential becomes deeper and much gravitational energy is released at the inner most region and the radius of the inner most stable orbit becomes smaller for a kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "this effect will enhance the luminosity of the neutrinos from the accretion disk ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the neutrino pair annihilation  @xcite . in the vicinity of the black hole ,",
    "most of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos come shadows due to the bending effects of the neutrino geodesics .",
    "since the shape and position of the black hole shadow depend on the physical parameters of the black hole ( bardeen 1973 ; takahashi 2004 , 2005 ) , the effective area emitting the most of the neutrino flux just outside of the black hole shadows is also determined by the black hole parameters .",
    "these effects are included only when geodesics and disk structures are precisely calculated .    since according to our simulations",
    "the plasma beta (= pgas+radiation / pmag ) in the polar region is lower than the plasma beta in other regions and the minimum values of the plasma beta is 0.193 .",
    "this means that the polar region is magnetically dominated . in such regions where the magnetic energy is dominated such as a force - free field",
    ", the extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole is expected as poynting flux ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) and the negative energy ( blandford & payne 1982 ; takahashi et al .",
    "although these effects have been confirmed numerically by many authors  @xcite , there are many unsolved issues on the central engine of grbs .",
    "especially , the neutrino radiation from the negative energy fluid in the realistic general relativistic accretion flow is one of the unsolved issue .",
    "the past studies roughly estimate the extraction energy due to the blandford - znajek process to become non - negligible amount to the explosion of the long grss ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ; di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the properties of a progenitor of grbs are still unknown .",
    "there are much uncertainties on mass loss rate , final mass , angular momentum distribution , amplitude and configuration of magnetic fields prior to collapse .",
    "these properties will depend not only on initial mass and metallicity of progenitors but also on the presence ( or absence ) and properties of companion stars  @xcite .",
    "thus it is necessary to perform numerical simulations with many models of progenitors to ensure the validity of the mechanism to launch a grb jet from progenitors . in particular , we consider that the initial angular momentum distribution should be important since the mass accretion rate depends on it very sensitively .      as shown in eq .",
    "( [ dis : b-4 ] ) , the critical wavelength of maximum growth of the linear mri instability is quite short , so adaptive mesh refinement method ( e.g. norman 2005 ; zhang and macfadyen 2006 ; morsony et al .",
    "2006 ) is inevitably required to resolve the critical wavelength in a collapsar .",
    "of course , much cpu time is required to perform three dimensional calculation with adaptive mesh refinement method . moreover ,",
    "when we try to include neutrino transfer code , three dimensions are required additionally for the momentum space .",
    "however , people will be able to realize such an expensive simulation in the near future with a help of rapidly growing power of super - computers .",
    "of course , we are planning to devote ourselves to developing such a numerical code .",
    "we have performed two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations by the zeus-2d code to investigate the dynamics of a collapsar that generates a grb jet , taking account of realistic equation of state ( contribution of electrons , positrons , radiation , and ideal gas of nuclei ) , neutrino cooling and heating processes , magnetic fields , and gravitational force from the central black hole and self gravity .",
    "we have found that neutrino heating processes ( neutrino and anti - neutrino pair annihilation , and @xmath3 and @xmath31 captures on free nucleons ) are not so efficient to launch a jet .",
    "we have found that a jet is launched by magnetic fields ( in particular , @xmath0 fields that are amplified by the winding - up effect ) .",
    "however , the ratio of total energy relative to the rest mass energy in the jet at the final stage of simulations suggests that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet will not reach to as high as several hundred , so we conclude the jet seen in this study will not be a grb jet .",
    "we also found that the mass accretion rate seems to be enhanced in the models with magnetic fields .",
    "this might be because angular momentum is efficiently transfered by the viscosity due to the magnetic fields and multi - dimensional flow .    since grb jets are not obtained in this study , we consider that general relativistic effects , by which the efficiency of energy deposition through weak interactions will be enhanced and rotation energy of the black hole will be transfered to matter through the magnetic fields , will be important to generate a grb jet .",
    "thus we are planning to develop a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code in the very near future .",
    "also , the accretion disk with magnetic fields may still play an important role to launch a grb jet , and it may be seen if we can perform numerical simulations for much longer physical time ( say , @xmath1 s ) .",
    "to realize such a simulation , the special relativistic code will be helpful because the alfvn velocity is limited to the speed of light .",

    "moreover , we found that the electron fraction becomes larger than 0.5 around the polar axis near the black hole .",

    "<S> this result suggests that general relativistic effects , which are not included in this study , will be important to generate a grb jet . </S>",
    "<S> also , the accretion disk with magnetic fields may still play an important role to launch a grb jet , although a simulation for much longer physical time ( @xmath1 s ) is required to confirm this effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that considerable amount of @xmath2 is synthesized in the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> thus there will be a possibility for the accretion disk to supply sufficient amount of @xmath2 required to explain the luminosity of a hypernova . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is shown that neutron - rich matter due to electron captures with high entropy per baryon is ejected along the polar axis . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is found that the electron fraction becomes larger than 0.5 around the polar axis near the black hole by @xmath3 capture at the region . thus there will be a possibility that @xmath4-process and @xmath5process nucleosynthesis occur at these regions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , much neutrons will be ejected from the jet , which suggests that signals from the neutron decays may be observed as the delayed bump of the light curve of the afterglow or gamma - rays . </S>"
