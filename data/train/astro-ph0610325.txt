    "this signature is the evidence of the neutron star nature of the compact object .",
    "a broad band ( 0.1200 kev ) spectral study of the persistent emission was made by parmar et al .",

    "the spectrum was well described by a disk - blackbody and a comptonization ( comptt ) component plus the addition of a partial covering of the disk .",

    "this system belong to the globular cluster x - ray sources in binary systems characterized by short period ( @xmath5 1 hr ) and its optical counterpart is identified with a blue variable object with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "data analysis includes all the public data in which xb 1832 - 330 was within the isgri / ibis fully coded field of view ( @xmath79@xmath8 ) @xcite so that the source intensity determination is not effected by possible systematic errors due to uncertainties in the off - axis responce .",
    "the observations cover the period from 2003 march 22 to 2005 september 25 for a total of 132 scws ( pointing lasting about 2000 seconds ) .",
    "we used the 5.1 version of the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) @xcite of the software .",
    "the spectral analysis was done with the xspec package v.  11.3 and a 0.02 systematic error was added to the data .",

    "we have extracted spectra for each pointing and because of the lack of flux variation , as revealed by the ibis ( and asm ) light curves , we added all the available spectra to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the final spectrum correspond to a total exposure time of 178 ks .",
    "this spectrum extends up to 150 kev and it is well described by a comptonization model ( comptt ) @xcite with a thermal plasma temperature , @xmath10 , of about 22 kev and optical depth of the electrons plasma , @xmath11 , of about 2 , with a @xmath12=0.9 . the temperature of the seed photons , @xmath13 , has been frozen at the best fit value of 0.15 kev , because this photons are well below the ibis energy band .",

    "[ fig4 ] is reported the best fit model of comptonization ( corrected additon of the interstellar absorbtion , n@xmath14 , of 4.6@xmath15 atom @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "the electron plasma temperature and the plasma optical depth are in the typical range values of the lmxbs when in hard spectral state .",
    "the _ integral_/ibis long monitoring of the source xb 1832330 shows that the spectrum of this compact source extend up to 150 kev and it is well described by a thermal comptonization with the temperature of the electrons , @xmath10 , of 22 kev and optical depth , @xmath11 , of 1.8 .",
    "these parameter values are compatible with those found in previous bepposax analisys ( @xmath16 kev @xmath17 @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , assuming a distance of 9.2 kpc , the 0.1 - 200 kev luminosity as derived from the model , is 5.4@xmath4 erg s@xmath1 that is consistent with the previous bepposax measurement .    the ibis result indicate that , in the hard x - ray band , the source is a persistent , `` stable '' one and spend most of the time in the typical hard state of lmxbs .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one showed by 4u 181212 in the same domain of hard x - ray as reported by tarana et al .",
    "2006 @xcite , even if both sources are atoll and therefore changes in flux and spectral shape are expected .",
    "the hard component of xb 1832330 is explained to be due to the comptonization of soft photons coming from the accretion disk and the neutron star surface .",
    "unluckly no data are available for the _ integral _ x - ray detector , jem - x , and then we can not investigate the presence of a disk blackbody component that indicate emission from the disk or / and the neutron star surface ( as shown in @xcite ) .",
