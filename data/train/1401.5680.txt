    "in recent years , the interest in topological phases of matter and topological phase transitions@xcite was renewed by the discovery of topological insulators and superconductors.@xcite for noninteracting insulators possible topological states have been classified@xcite and the transitions between different topological states have been found to be characterized by closing of the single - particle gap.@xcite much of the recent research has focused on understanding the role of interactions in topological insulators.@xcite of particular interest are interaction - generated topological insulators , or topological mott insulators.@xcite such states appear due to the presence of electronic interactions that give rise to nonlocal complex bond order parameters and spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry.@xcite the possibility of realizing novel interaction - generated topologically nontrivial phases , without requirement of strong intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , could significantely extend the class of topologically nontrivial materials and is thus of great importance . +",
    "interacting spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice is perhaps the best studied example in which an interaction - generated topologically nontrivial state , a quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) state , is predicted to appear by several mean - field theory calculations.@xcite however , recent exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies of small clusters with periodic boundary condition@xcite find no clear sign of a such topologically nontrivial state . in this manuscript we present ed results for small clusters with open boundary condition .",
    "contrary to previous ed studies,@xcite we find clear signatures of the interaction - driven topological transition in the fidelity metric@xcite and show that the transition is characterized by closing of the excitation gap .",
    "we also demonstrate the existence of the edge states in the qah phase by calculating the density profile of a hole created out of the ground state at half - filling.@xcite + to study properties of the system for larger system sizes we use entangled plaquette state ( eps ) ansatz , also called correlator product state ( cps ) ansatz , @xcite for the ground state wave function of the system and variational monte carlo ( vmc).@xcite in the eps approach the lattice is covered with plaquettes and the ground state wave - function is written in terms of the plaquette coefficients .",

    "while dmrg gives very accurate results only in one dimension @xcite and qmc suffers from the sign problem for fermi systems , the eps and vmc approach can be applied to systems of any spatial dimensionality and is sign problem free .",
    "+ the values of the plaquette coefficients that minimize the energy can be found using the stochastic minimization method.@xcite due to the presence of the statistical error in the stochastic algorithm it is difficult to obtain good estimates of the ground state energies for small system sizes .",
    "having a larger number of parameters allows the optimization method more freedom in finding the minimum energy state and the statistical error can be controlled by increasing the sample size .",

    "+ the topological phase transitions from sm to qah phase and from qah phase to cms phase for 128 sites cluster , characterized by singular points in the density - functional fidelity susceptibility , can be clearly seen in fig.[fig : dffs ] .",
    "also , a charge modulation within the same sublattice in the cms phase can be clearly seen in the density distribution as shown in fig.[fig : n_2.8 ] , while the charge modulation is absent in the qah phase ( fig.[fig : n_1.8 ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that for the 128 sites cluster and at @xmath14 the qah phase is found for @xmath163 , that is very close to the mean - field theory predictions for the system in the thermodynamic limit and to the ed result obtained for a much smaller system size ( 18 site cluster ) .",
    "+ we also note that in the thermodynamic limit the two lowest energy states , that are odd and even under tr , become exactly degenerate in the qah regime .",
    "consequantly there are two degenerate qah ground states with oposite chirality ( chern number @xmath20 ) in the thermodynamic limit . that also leads to the disappearance of the cusp in the energy as a function of @xmath25 at the sm - qah phase transition , and confirms that the sm - qah transition is a continuous phase transition as predicted by the mean - field theory calculations .",
    "+ in summary , our results obtained using the eps ansatz for the ground state wavefunction and vmc indicate existence of the qah state for larger system sizes and provide further confirmation of the presence of the qah phase in the thermodynamic limit , as predicted by several mean - field theory calculations.@xcite this is in contrast to the previous results @xcite obtained using ed method for small clusters with periodic boundary condition and cluster perturbation theory .",
    "we have studied the system of interacting spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice . using exact diagonalization method for small system sizes , and entangled - plaquette state ansatz and variational monte carlo method for larger system sizes , we find evidence for the existence of the interaction generated quantum hall state previously predicted by several mean - field theory calculations.@xcite in particular , we presented results for 18 sites cluster and 128 sites cluster with open boundary condition .",
    "we find clear signs of the predicted topological phase transitions ( from semimetal to interaction - generated quantum hall state and from quantum hall state to charge modulated state ) in the fidelity metric and also demonstrate the appearance of the sublattice charge modulation in the charge modulated phase by calculating the density profile for the 128 sites cluster .",
    "the quantum hall state was not found in the previous exact diagonalization studies of small clusters with periodic boundary condition.@xcite our results thus indicate importance of the boundary condition and the symmetry of the cluster to detect topological order in finite size systems .",
    "the results also confirm validity of the jastrow - slater entangled - plaquette state ( correlator - product state ) ansatz to describe the ground states of the system .",
    "+ further work is necessary for more direct comparison of the entangled - plaquette state ansatz results with the exact diagonalization results for small clusters . as mentioned before , a disadvantage of the variational monte carlo stochastic algorithm is the presence of the statistical error which can be controlled by increasing the system size . to obtain the results that can be directly compared with the exact diagonalization results for small clusters it is therefore necessary to use nonstochastic algorithm@xcite to evaluate the energy and to optimize the amplitudes of the entangled - plaquette state wavefunction",
    "also , further insights could be obtained by considering the results using different types of correlators ( plaquettes of different shapes and sizes ) .",
    "additional directions of future research are to study the ground states of the system at nonzero nearest neighbor interaction strength @xmath5 and possible topological phases of the system away from half - filling that are predicted by mean - field theory calculations.@xcite we hope that the results presented in this manuscript will motivate further studies of the extended hubbard model for fermions on a honeycomb lattice and other models for which the interaction - generated topologically nontrivial phases have been predicted .",
