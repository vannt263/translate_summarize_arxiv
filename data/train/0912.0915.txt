    "metal - insulator transition ( mit ) of the mott - hubbard type represents one of the central problems in condensed matter physics and materials science , since it exemplifies a transition from well defined atomic ( localized or confined ) states to delocalized ( bloch- or fermi - liquid ) type of states in a solid @xcite and in other systems .",
    "@xcite the simplest model system represents a lattice of spin-1/2 fermions with one particle per atomic site .",
    "mott expressed this localized - delocalized transformation in terms of critical density @xmath6 of fermions ( or equivalently , in terms of critical interparticle distance @xmath7 , for three - dimensional system and the effective bohr- radius @xmath8 of the atomic states formed at the transition , in the form @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", hubbard @xcite and others @xcite formulated the criterion in the form that at the transition the magnitude of the intraatomic coulomb repulsive energy among the particles ( @xmath10 ) is equal to their kinetic ( band ) energy characterized by the bare bandwidth @xmath11 , i.e. that @xmath12 .",
    "these two criteria are regarded as related ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is also well defined as a phase transformation in thermodynamic sense with the corresponding critical points on high- and low - temperature sides . @xcite as close to mit the band energy ( negative ) is almost compensated by the repulsive ( coulomb ) interaction , the much smaller thermal and for atomic - disorder energies can drive the metallic system towards the state with localized spins . in effect , the resultant phase diagrams contain first - order pressure - temperature transition line with a _ classical critical point _ at temperature @xmath13 and a quantum critical point at @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of the former critical points was confirmed experimentally recently @xcite and shown to represent properties of the van der waals liquid - gas critical point for the three - dimensional case of v@xmath15o@xmath16:cr .",
    "the basic question remains under what conditions a quantum critical point ( qcp ) appears also at @xmath17 between the metallic and insulating phases , as its existence marks explicitly the fundamental boundary between the atomic and the condensed ( delocalized , deconfined ) quantum states .",
    "the appearance of such qcp is usually obscured by the presence , at low temperatures , of antiferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , the answer to the above question , even without inclusion of magnetic ordering , would delineate the basic characteristics of the ( quantum ) critical point at the border of localization driven by the interparticle interaction .",
    "@xcite    mit involves the drastic change of quantum macro states from a metal to an insulator , so a natural and not addressed , as far as we are aware of , is the question how this drastic change of the macro state is reflected in the corresponding single - particle wave - function change when approaching the transition from either side .",
    "the parameterized - model approaches @xcite leave the wannier functions determining the microscopic parameters such as the hopping integral @xmath18 or hubbard interaction @xmath10 , as fixed when crossing the transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the original mott approach @xcite introduces intuitively the concept of an emergent atomic state _ at the instability _ of the metallic state ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) .",
    "thus , the missing question is : _ how the electron correlations and the single - particle states are interrelated microscopically _ ?",
    "this question is particularly important , since the fermi - liquid state near the mott - hubbard localization is particularly robust and therefore the mott - hubbard localization at @xmath19 has a strongly discontinuous nature @xcite , apart from the classical critical point of @xmath20 the crossover behavior for the temperatures above it .",
    "furthermore , at the transition the renormalized band and the coulomb energies are comparable and compensate each other .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we provide a simple answer to the above question by treating electronic states close to mit within the approach in which both the interelectronic correlations and the single - particle wannier wave functions @xmath21 are treated _ on the same footing _ @xcite . by this",
    "we mean that those wave functions are determined simultaneously with the interparticle correlations determining the many - body ground state . as a result",
    ", we obtain a _ singular _ behavior of the single - particle ( wannier ) wave function renormalized by the correlations .",
    "this nonanalytic character , and concomitant with it unique scaling laws , appear only when the wave function is determined explicitly _  posteriori _",
    ", i.e. _ is readjusted in the correlated state_. such a simultaneous determination of the single - particle wave function and two - particle aspects of the many - particle dynamics is indispensable in the situation when the single - particle and interaction is comparable or , in some cases , the latter even becomes dominant . in this sense , our analysis complements that performed within either lda+dmft @xcite or lda+u @xcite methods , as well as the qcp study @xcite , all of which contain parameters characterizing electronic correlations introduced only after the lda or similar calculations have been carried out .",
    "obviously , the gutzwiller-_ansatz _ used here provides an exact wave function only in the limit of high dimensions ( i.e. above the upper critical dimension , not determined as yet ) , but it provides at least a mean - field - like discussion of the renormalization aspects of the single - particle wave function near mit , not discussed so far in the literature . in connection with this last limitation of our method , we would like to point out , that it would be very interesting to apply methods such as dmft @xcite to the proposed optimization of the wannier functions in the correlated state .",
    "however , no reliable method of evaluating explicitly the dmft ground - state energy as a function of microscopic parameters has been proposed so far , starting from which the explicit wave - function optimization can be undertaken .",
    "we should also underline , that our method incorporating an exact diagonalization was applied earlier to both correlated nano- @xcite and macro- @xcite systems .",
    "we should also point out that this method is free from the double counting of the repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , even though the presented below results describe a model situation and within a rather simple scheme , they can be regarded as an essential additional ingredient to be implemented in modeling real correlated systems near mit . as was underlined earlier @xcite , within the present method we can follow the system evolution as a function of interatomic distance , not only as a function of model parameters .",
    "such circumstance allows for an explicit analysis , at least in a qualitative manner , of the system evolution as a function of external pressure .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce briefly the method devised before .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "3 we introduce an original critical scaling of the single - particle wave function characteristics and of the ground - state energy . in sec .",
    "4 we show that the critical scaling is absent for one- and two - dimensional lattices , in the former case in agreement with the absence of metal - insulator transitions , as discussed rigorously by lieb and wu .",
    "@xcite in this section we also derive the classic mott criterion of the metal - insulator transition within the frame of our approach . sec .",
    "5 contains both a brief discussion of extension to more realistic situation and concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "a we provide an elementary derivation and discussion of the original mott criterion .",
    "@xcite , whereas in appendix b we define an adjustable gaussian basis in which the renormalized wannier function has been determined explicitly .",
    "a methodological remark is in place here . in our earlier work , @xcite the method of approach composed of the diagonalization in the fock space combined with the single - particle wave - function renormalization in the hilbert space ,",
    "has been applied to the discussion of the metallic state up to the metal - insulator transition point .",
    "no scaling presented here was either noticed or discussed there .",
    "@xcite therefore , we demonstrate here , in an explicit manner , the applicability of our method when _ crossing _ the metal - insulator boundary of the mott - hubbard type .",
    "namely , we study explicitly the gradual evolution of renormalized wannier functions into their atomic correspondant in the large interatomic - distance limit .",
    "on the two above aspects rests our motivation that the present paper extends essentially our earlier approach .",
    "we start from extended hubbard model with inclusion of intersite coulomb interaction and ion - ion interaction as represented by the parameterized hamiltonian @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 where the first term describes the effective atomic energy with @xmath24 the second represents the hopping between the nearest - neighboring sites , the third the hubbard ( intraatomic ) and the fourth is a part of intersite coulomb interaction , with @xmath25 being the deviation from the integer electron occupancy @xmath26 , and @xmath27 - the intersite coulomb interaction . the term @xmath28 in ( [ eq : w2 ] ) expresses the classical coulomb repulsion ( in atomic units ) for two ions separated by the distance @xmath29 .",
    "it is important to note that the presence of intersite coulomb interaction is necessary in achieving a proper atomic limit when @xmath30 .",
    "the model has been defined in details earlier .",
    "@xcite    in the mott - hubbard insulating ground - state the hole - hole correlations are absent i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "the role of these correlations is indeed negligible if the fundamental correlation function @xmath32 vanishes or is very small , as also discussed earlier .",
    "@xcite it vanishes in the mott insulating state ( for @xmath4 ) .",
    "the microscopic parameters of this model are expressed via the wannier functions in the standard manner @xcite , @xmath33 , as follows : the bare atomic energy is @xmath34 , the hopping integral @xmath35 , intraatomic - interaction magnitude @xmath36 , and interatomic - interaction magnitude @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the hamiltonian for a single particle in the system , and @xmath39 represents interparticle interaction .",
    "the wannier functions are expressed in terms of adjustable slater atomic functions , i.e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of nearest neighbors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are mixing coefficients , and @xmath44 is the @xmath45 slater function centered on the site @xmath46 . in the concrete calculations ,",
    "they are represented by adjustable gaussians ( e.g. sto-7 g basis in dimensions @xmath47 , cf .",
    "appendix b ) .",
    "the properties of those functions have been discussed in detail before .",
    "@xcite here we concentrate on the novel aspects of the approach only .",
    "this means we explicitly determine the critical interatomic distance @xmath48 for the metal - insulator transition , as well as determine the wave function characteristic as a function of @xmath0 , both above and below @xmath49 .",
    "based on these results we determine scaling properties of physical quantities vs. the parameter @xmath50 . in effect , we show that not only the wave - functions determination and the electronic correlations are interrelated , but also the former characteristic exhibits a singular behavior at the onset of mott - hubbard localization .",
    "this last feature of our results represents the principal message of this paper .",
    "as said above , the fundamental principle behind our approach is that the wave functions @xmath21 determined variationally in the hilbert space are treated on the same footing as the diagonalization of ( [ eq : w1 ] ) in the fock space .",
    "such diagonalization is possible in an exact manner for nanoscopic and infinite hubbard chain @xmath51 systems only .",
    "@xcite however , also the gutzwiller wave - function ( gwf ) and the gutzwiller - ansatz ( ga ) approximations lead to close results in the latter case ( see below ) provided the wave functions @xmath21 are properly readjusted in the correlated state to achieve the ground - state energy as a global minimum for given lattice parameter @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the energy of the correlated state is readjusted iteratively multiple times by adjusting the component atomic - wave - function size @xmath52 and in effect , also the microscopic parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath10 , and @xmath27 determining the many - particle ground state . as a result of such iterative approach",
    ", we obtain renormalized wave functions @xmath55 and the microscopic parameters , as well as the ground - state energy , and most importantly , an explicit scaling of the physical properties , all as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "below we analyze first the results obtained for ga for three - dimensional cubic lattices , before testing the method feasibility for @xmath56 and @xmath57 situations .",
    "the main emphasis is lead on the novel singular scaling properties near the mott - hubbard critical spacing @xmath5 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wanniersc ] we plot exemplary wannier function centered at @xmath58 for simple cubic ( sc ) lattice and drawn along [ 1,0,0 ] direction and for @xmath59 ( dot - dashed line ) @xmath5 ( solid line ) , and @xmath60 ( dashed line ) .",
    "one observes immediately a surprising feature , namely the wave function for @xmath61 is more extended than that for @xmath5 and with the increasing @xmath0 the size @xmath62 gradually reaches its bohr atomic 1s - state value @xmath63 .",
    "an overall wave - function profile evolution as a function of @xmath0 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : profilessc ] . on the whole , the wave function seems to evolve continuously for @xmath4 and reaches its atomic @xmath45 shape gradually , except for a local maximum which appears at the specific lattice constant @xmath5 , as marked by the vertical arrow . before studying this unusual feature",
    "let us note , that our method enables us to study this wave - function evolution in the whole range of @xmath0 ( across the metal - insulator boundary ) as long as the tight - binding approximation is reliable .",
    "this is so , as we shall see and the interesting scaling laws appear near @xmath64 which falls in the limits of large and small interatomic separation , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the value @xmath48 is determined from the point when the renormalized band energy is completely compensated by the coulomb interaction part and coincides with the correlation function @xmath67 in the gutzwiller - ansatz approximation for the half - filled - band case .      to study the noted above nontrivial behavior of the wave function in detail , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : relinvsize ] , the relative inverse size @xmath69 of the component atomic functions as a function of relative lattice spacing @xmath70 in the regime @xmath71 . a clear @xmath72 discontinuity ( cf .",
    "inset ) is observed at @xmath5 for all cubic lattices , a rather unique and unexpected feature , which is completely absent for the case with bare ( unrenormalized ) wave functions , as then @xmath73 would be simply a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "note also that the wave function is the narrowest at the mott - hubbard transition , at which @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in the metallic phase ) . to determine the universality of the behavior",
    ", we have replotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfanormlogscal]a the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : relinvsize ] for @xmath61 in a doubly logarithmic scale .",
    "one observes a clear power law scaling @xmath76^{{\\it s}}$ ] , with @xmath77 for not too large @xmath0 above @xmath64 .",
    "the results for @xmath59 exhibit also a similar trend with the exponent @xmath78 with an overall exponent @xmath78 slightly lower @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 lattices i.e. weakly dependent on the type of cubic lattice selected , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfanormlogscal]b .",
    "this nonuniversal character ( cf . also the part for @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig : relinvsize ] ) may be caused by the circumstance that the tight - binding approximation for the wave function should be extended to more distant neighbors , as the presence of carriers screens out effectively the coulomb interaction ( the value @xmath82 increases as @xmath0 decreases ) .",
    "nonetheless , in spite the lack of simplicity of the precise scaling for @xmath59 , it is reassuring that the critical - exponent values for @xmath59 are close to that for @xmath61 .",
    "this power - law scaling describes the singular behavior of the _ atomic_-wave - function size @xmath83 .",
    "also , the function in fig .  [ fig : relinvsize ] with @xmath30 does not reach zero , since @xmath84 .",
    "one can also study the related properties of the renormalized wannier function directly .",
    "for that purpose we have displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxw0 ] the maximal value of @xmath85 as a function of the scaling parameter @xmath86 .",
    "again , also for that quantity , we observe a similar type of scaling as for @xmath52 , with the critical exponent @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "however , the corresponding scaling law in the regime @xmath59 is again not as clear , as that for @xmath61 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : relinvsize ] and  [ fig : maxw0 ] ) .",
    "note that close to @xmath48 we have @xmath88 , where @xmath8 is the renormalized bohr radius in the correlated state .",
    "in other words both @xmath89 and @xmath90 scale the same way with @xmath91 .",
    "there is no obvious quantity like @xmath52 characterizing the width of the renormalized wannier function @xmath92 .",
    "this is the reason why we calculated an overall ( average ) size of the renormalized wannier function defined as @xmath93 , and have plotted it in fig .",
    "[ fig : averager ] as a function of @xmath94 for the three cubic lattices .",
    "while we observe anticusp behavior of @xmath95 at @xmath5 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 lattices , there is no clear sign of that happening for the @xmath96 case .",
    "however , one has to realize , that calculation of @xmath97 involves a three - dimensional integration over space in the situation when the wannier functions are strongly anisotropic .",
    "@xcite because of this specific reason , we regard the scaling of @xmath98 maximum shown in fig .  [ fig : maxw0 ] as more direct , as since involves the wave function characteristic which is not averaged out and , obviously , independent of the spatial direction . nonetheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig : relaversize ] we display the corresponding scaling of the relative difference @xmath99 for @xmath4 .",
    "the less systematic behavior even for @xmath4 does not allow us to draw any definite conclusions for that regime .",
    "note that for @xmath4 even in the case of fcc lattice , where @xmath100 is approximately continuous when crossing @xmath64 , we observe the same type of scaling , as that discussed for sc and bcc lattices .",
    "this means again that the scaling in the mott insulating phase is induced by the intersite coulomb interaction .",
    "the scaling with varying @xmath101 is also observed for the ground state energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyscal ] . the approximate dependence @xmath102 of @xmath103 when approaching the atomic limit can be attributed to the dominant role of the coulomb repulsion ( note the absolute value of the energy ) .",
    "to summarize this section , both the figs  [ fig : alfanormlogscal ] and  [ fig : relaversize ] demonstrate ( for @xmath104 ) , respectively the appearance of a overall scaling of the @xmath105 type , with @xmath106 .",
    "this dependence could be seen in the pressure dependence of the orbital size when close to the critical value @xmath5 .",
    "however , the relative changes of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are rather subtle and the question remains if they can become observable in the present day e.g. scanning tunneling observations of the localized orbitals in the mott insulating state .",
    "for such purpose , relevant are the plots of the maximal value @xmath109 of the wannier function relative to that at @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : maxw0 ] ) .",
    "the particle occupancy change at @xmath110 reaches up to @xmath111 of the peak value upon change of @xmath112 of the lattice constant either way , so it could become observable . on the basis of our results one can also say , that our approach provides evidence for effects in the wannier function , which are pronounced already in the mott - hubbard insulating state . in other words , the hubbard split subband picture of the mott insulator is concomitant with a strong renormalization of the wave function characteristics when approaching the transition point .",
    "this critical behavior does not alter the monotonic increase of the @xmath113 ratio with the increasing lattice constant @xcite , as shown explicitly in the fig .",
    "[ fig : u_t3d ] for all three cubic lattices .",
    "the almost exponential growth of this ratio for @xmath114 is a signature of entering into the strong - correlation limit .",
    "also , the presence of the scaling demonstrates the onset of the collective character of the quantum critical regime , in which the mott insulating state can not be regarded as a collection of atomic states with unpaired spins , at least when @xmath68 .",
    "finally , we examine the role of lattice dimensionality on the singular behavior of the wave function . for that purpose ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : invsizech ] the inverse wave - function size @xmath52 vs. @xmath115 for the linear chain within the modified exact lieb - wu ( lw ) , @xcite gutzwiller- wave - function ( gwf ) , @xcite and gutzwiller - ansatz ( ga ) @xcite solutions , respectively .",
    "none of the three methods provides in @xmath56 case ( and ga also in the @xmath116 case ) any type of singular behavior observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : relinvsize ] and  [ fig : maxw0 ] for the @xmath117 case .",
    "what is more important , all the three methods provide quite similar results for @xmath56 , i.e. there is no critical behavior of the type discussed above .",
    "@xcite this circumstance provides us with some confidence , that modified by us ga method ( including the interatomic interaction exactly in the mott insulating state ) bears some physical relevance to the mit transition treated in mean - field approximation .",
    "mit transition for @xmath56 and @xmath116 lattices which appears in the standard ( mean - field ) gutzwiller ansatz , does not show up in the behavior of the renormalized wave function in real space .",
    "this is one of the main supplementary results of this paper . to illustrate that , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : invsizech ] exemplary wannier function vs. @xmath115 for triangular ( tr ) and square ( sq ) lattices .",
    "the results for @xmath116 are obtained for ga solution .",
    "again , no critical behavior discussed above is observed .    on the basis of these results",
    "we draw the conclusion , that within our approach the critical behavior of the wannier function appears only for high - dimension ( @xmath118 ) lattices .",
    "this circumstance is in accord with the notion that ga results are more realistic in high dimensions .",
    "the striking coincidence of these results with the critical dimensionality @xmath119 for the onset of landau - fermi liquid stability should therefore be mentioned .",
    "@xcite the metallic @xmath120 state of the present approach is represented by an _ almost localized fermi liquid _",
    "@xcite ( alfl ) , which differs from the landau fermi liquid by a strong ( and spin dependent ) mass enhancement factor , as well as by a presence of metamagnetism .",
    "@xcite    as a supplementary information , we provide in fig .",
    "[ fig : aversizewannch ] the average size @xmath97 of the renormalized wannier function for linear chain ( ch ) and the two - dimensional lattices , sq and tr . as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : renwannsqtr ] , no singular character has been observed for this quantity .",
    "these results confirm again that our results are sensitive to the lattice dimensionality and nontrivial properties appear only in the high - dimension limit , where the mean - field ( gutzwiller ) approximation may be regarded as at least qualitatively correct .",
    "@xcite here they appear already for @xmath117 .    one additional basic feature of our approach should be mentioned .",
    "namely , in table i we list characteristics of the mott - hubbard transition for the cubic lattices .",
    "these results intercorrelate nicely with the mott criterion in the following manner .",
    "the critical carrier concentration for the mott transition in the present situations is @xmath121 for sc , @xmath122 for bcc , and @xmath123 for fcc .",
    "thus @xmath124 , with @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "the mott criterion discussed in qualitative terms in appendix a , takes for those lattices the form : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , for sc , bcc , and fcc lattices , very close values to that obtained originally by mott , @xcite and rederived in an elementary manner in appendix a. this connection provides an additional argument for a qualitative correctness of our approach in the sense , that a well defined value of @xmath64 obtained from ga solution , corresponds nicely with the historic criterion introduces by mott .",
    "@xcite parenthetically , the agreement ( cf . table 1 ) relates nicely the mott and hubbard criteria for mit .",
    "the ground state energy of h atom in these three representations are respectively -0.991 ry , -0.99912 ry and -0.99987 ry .",
    "additionally , the expressions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , can be used to evaluate the hopping integral @xmath129 .",
    "the main reason for introducing the gaussian is to be able to calculate efficiently the many - site integrals involving the repulsive coulomb interactions , which appear in evaluation of @xmath10 and @xmath130 parameters of the parameterized hamiltonian ( 1 ) in sec .",
    "2 . in general the coulomb integral @xmath131 has the following form in the gaussian representation @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 using those expression , the following expressions for parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( i.e. those calculated for the atomic wave functions ; @xmath10 and @xmath130 are those calculated in the wannier representation @xcite :        explicit calculation of the above integrals requires a number of numerical operations .",
    "for example evaluation of integral ( 22 ) involves computation of 81 integrals in sto-3 g basis and 2401 integrals in sto-7 g basis .",
    "nevertheless , they can be calculated efficiently .",
    "obviously , the whole procedure still requires the minimization of the total state energy with respect to @xmath107 in the correlated state .",
