    "the study of strongly correlated quantum systems and materials , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein , is a very rapidly evolving field in both experimental and theoretical physics .",
    "especially the out - of - equilibrium dynamics is of great current interest in solid - state , atomic and molecular physics , in nanoelectronics , quantum transport etc . in all these fields ,",
    "the availability of intense and coherent radiation , combined with ultra - short laser pulses , has triggered many key experiments that allow one to investigate matter under extreme nonequilibrium conditions where correlation and nonlinear effects are important . as examples ,",
    "consider the photoionization of multi - electron atoms and molecules  @xcite , the many - body dynamics of particles in optical lattices  @xcite or quantum interference effects in mott insulators  @xcite .",
    "in the recent decade , the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach has developed into a powerful numerical tool and is able to address the dynamics of very different quantum systems .",
    "examples include the excitation of non - ideal ( semiconductor ) plasmas  @xcite , nuclear collisions  @xcite , the carrier dynamics and carrier - phonon interaction in quantum dots , wells and lattice networks contacted to leads  @xcite , and the problem of baryogenesis in cosmology  @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the central quantity is the one - particle nonequilibrium green s function defined on the complex keldysh contour @xmath1 , @xmath2 with non - temporal degrees of freedom @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for our purpose , @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 will refer to spatial degrees of freedom , and @xmath6 will indicate the spin , assuming diagonality in the spin subspace .",
    "further , the operator @xmath7 accounts for contour ordering of the times @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 means averaging in the grand canonical ensemble .    in principle",
    ", the two - time dependence of the green s function enables the systematic and exact treatment of dynamic correlation effects independently of the strength of the interaction and regardless of the presence of weak or strong external fields .",
    "even interaction quenches can be studied , e.g.  @xcite . however , the application to large system sizes and the investigation of the system s long time behavior usually demand additional approximations and simplifications to the equations of motions of the negf  @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to perform a many - body approximation ( mba ) on the self - energy . due to diagram expansions ,",
    "this can be done in a systematic and conserving way and leads , e.g. , to the hartree - fock ( hf ) , second(-order ) born ( 2b ) , gw or t - matrix approximations .",
    "correlation effects are then partially treated beyond the level of hartree - fock .",
    "additional simplifications typically concern the two - time structure which renders negf calculations demanding  @xcite . within the generalized kadanoff baym ansatz ( gkba )",
    "@xcite , it is possible to study the equations of motion for the green s function in the single - time limit , which drastically reduces the numerical effort .    in general , the application of mbas and other simplifications such as the gkba require thorough justification as they can lead to unphysical effects such as self - interaction errors and spurious dynamical excitations  @xcite , bistability  @xcite or artificial steady states  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we , in this contribution , extend previous work on weak perturbations  @xcite , which included the discussion of double excitations ( see also  @xcite ) , to the nonlinear regime and analyze the performance of the gkba for a finite system with the two - body interactions being treated in the second born approximation .",
    "introducing the one - particle self - energy @xmath11 , the green s function ( [ gdef ] ) obeys the kadanoff - baym equation ( kbe )  @xcite , @xmath12 and its adjoint with @xmath13 . here",

    ", we transform the set of kbes into a single equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath16 or equivalently @xmath17 retaining time causality and important conservation laws such as the conservation of total energy , momentum and density .",
    "in the course of this , the time - off - diagonal components of the negf are reconstructed as ( we again sum over @xmath15 ) , @xmath18 and inserted into the time - diagonal collision integral ( the r.h.s .  of the kbes for @xmath19 in the second born approximation ) . for an explicit expression of @xmath11 as functional of the negf and for the corresponding collision term ,",
    "see , e.g. , the contribution of s.  hermanns _ et al .",
    "_ in the present conference proceedings .",
    "finally , the treatment of the two - time retarded and advanced propagators @xmath20 and @xmath21 in hartree - fock approximation renders the ansatz practical : @xmath22)\\exp{\\left(-{\\mathrm{i}}{\\int_{t'}^{t}\\mathrm{d}{\\bar{t}}\\;}h^\\sigma_\\mathrm{hf}(\\bar{t})\\right)}\\right|_{ss'}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 denotes the single - particle time - dependent hartree - fock hamiltonian .",
    "we emphasize that the reconstruction of the greater and lesser components of the green s function with real @xmath8 and @xmath9 is sufficient as long as the method of adiabatic switching is applied to generate the correlated initial ( ground ) state by time propagation , for details see @xcite .",
    "as outlined above , we are interested in the dynamical behavior of a finite quantum system beyond the regime of linear response . to this end , we consider a one - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling with hopping @xmath24 and on - site interaction @xmath0 and strongly perturb it by changing the site energies in time  @xcite .",
    "the initial hamiltonian for times @xmath25 reads , @xmath26 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 for a chain of length @xmath29 , and @xmath30 indicates nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "further , @xmath31 denotes the density operator , and the energy ( time ) is measured in units of @xmath24 ( the inverse hopping @xmath32 ) . generally , we study the chain for open boundary conditions but this is irrelevant for the special case of two sites .",

    "subsequently , also the density on the remaining sites will change with time , and , finally , all occupations will start to oscillate . in the case of @xmath38 , the population change will be small , such that the dynamics should be well characterized by the linear response properties of the chain . for @xmath39 , however , we expect nonlinear effects to be of importance . in the following ,",

    "this is the case , though the broadening of the peaks strongly increases with @xmath0 . in the opposite case , for @xmath0",
    "approaching zero , the double - peak structure correctly merges into a single peak indicating the degenerate transition frequencies @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the course of this ,",
    "also the additional side peaks ( which throughout have frequency offsets of multiples of @xmath93 ) vanish . in general , the resolution of the side peaks depends on the window function used in the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ gammadefft])while in figure  [ fig3 ] we use a hamming window , the data shown in figure  [ fig4 ] are obtained by applying a hann window .",

    "the reason for this extreme broadening is a strong damping of the time - dependent occupations @xmath98 in 2b , for details see  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of figure  [ fig1 ] with figures  [ fig2 ] to [ fig4 ] , allows for the statement that 2b+gkba seems to capture the correct physics ( in contrast to the hartree - fock results and full 2b calculations ) although there appear additional artifacts in @xmath49 such as broadening and side peaks .",

    ", it is easily shown  @xcite that the excited state @xmath102 is a doubly - excited state relative to the ground state @xmath103 , whereas the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 are singly - excited states . with the same argument",
    ", state @xmath102 is furthermore also a doubly - excited state relative to the ground state ( gs ) of @xmath43 .",
    "this has the following consequences :    1 .",
    "the energetically largest transition @xmath106 will not appear in the hf solution as double excitations are generally not included in any time - dependent hartree - fock calculation  @xcite .",
    "the transitions @xmath89 and @xmath107 are of one - electron character and therefore in principle describable by hartree - fock .",
    "the reason why , nonetheless , one observes only the transition @xmath89 is that the function @xmath49 combined with the excitation ( [ h1 ] ) only probes energy differences between states that are populated already at time @xmath42 . according to ( i ) , however , the state @xmath102 is never populated in hf .    points ( i ) and ( ii ) , clearly explain the simplicity and shortcomings of the hf solution for the nonlinear response spectra @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , an analysis of the exact eigenstates of the two hamiltonians @xmath43 and @xmath108 reveals that there is finite overlap only between the ground state of @xmath43 and the states @xmath103 , @xmath105 and @xmath102 of @xmath108 ( all being singlets ) . the vanishing overlap with the eigenstate @xmath104 ( the triplet with @xmath109  @xcite ) is responsible for the fact that we do not observe transitions involving state @xmath104 in the density - response . in terms of the wave function , the dynamics of the system for @xmath35 is therefore , @xmath110 with @xmath111 being the eigenstates of @xmath108 ( having energy @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 denoting the expansion coefficients with respect to the ground state @xmath114 of @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast to the hf approximation , a second - order self - energy ( as 2b ) has the ability to describe double excitations , see  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the 2b+gkba calculations capture the transition @xmath72 and , accordingly , also @xmath73 . in this context",
    ", we again emphasize that the obtained frequency for the transition @xmath106 is not a multiple of any other frequency observed in 2b+gkba , compare the red dots and the blue squares in the left panel of figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the linear fits to the data points are , @xmath115 in hartree - fock , we obtain , @xmath116    with the result of eq .",
    "( [ fit2b ] ) , the second born approximation plus gkba gives a complete picture of the nonequilibrium dynamics in the considered hubbard chain .",
    "however , there is one additional effect in 2b+gkba we can not ignore .",
    "this concerns the approximate value for the double excitation frequency @xmath99 which behaves differently as function of @xmath0 than the values for the single excitations @xmath74 and @xmath73 : while the approximate frequencies @xmath85 and @xmath86 follow the exact results as @xmath0 is increased , we observe a negative slope ( @xmath117 in the linear fit ) as function of @xmath0 for @xmath72 .",
    "this is opposite to the exact solution which reveals a clearly positive slope and minor absolute value of @xmath118 for small @xmath119 , see the upper solid black line in figure  [ fig5 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated a small hubbard - type system with respect to its excitation properties beyond the linear response regime by propagating the kadanoff - baym equations in hf and 2b+gkba . in the course of this",
    ", we found clear signals of electron - electron correlations , and the absence of damped solutions for the density - response @xmath96 in 2b+gkba allowed us to compute the approximate transition frequencies as function of the interaction strength .",
