    "neutron star binary systems have been recognized as potential central engines of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) already two decades ago , they have been mentioned in ( 1986 ) and goodman et al .",

    "( 1989 ) ( for a more complete bibliography we refer to existing reviews , e.g. meszaros 2002 or piran 2005 ) . as a variant of the neutron star binary case ( 1991 ) discussed systems containing a neutron star ( ns ) and a stellar mass black hole ( bh ) as a possible grb engine .",
    "these days , such compact binary systems are considered the standard model for the subclass of short gamma - ray bursts , that last typically for about 0.3 s ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) .",
    "most recently , on 9 may 2005 the first ever x - ray afterglow for a short ( @xmath3 30 ms ) , hard grb ( grb050509b ) has been detected ( bloom et al . 2005 ) .",
    "its tentative association with a nearby giant elliptical galaxy has been interpreted as an indication for a compact binary merger origin of this burst ( bloom et al .",
    "2005 , lee et al .",
    "while nsbh binaries are usually just considered to be a minor variation on the topic of double neutron star merger ( dns ) , it has been pointed out recently ( rosswog et al .",
    "2004 ) that it is not obvious , that such a coalescence will automatically produce a hot and massive accretion disk around the hole .",
    "therefore , its role for gamma - ray bursts needs further investigations .",
    "+ during the disruption process tidal torques are expected to eject material into highly eccentric , possibly unbound orbits .",
    "this debris is extremely neutron rich , @xmath4 , and therefore ( if ejected at appropriate rates ) holds the promise to be one of the still much debated sources of r - process elements ( lattimer and schramm 1974 and 1976 ) .",
    "+ moreover , nsbh systems are generally considered promising sources for ground - based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo @xcite , geo600 ( luck et al .",
    "2001 ) , virgo ( caron et al . 1997 ) and tama ( tagoshi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "+ it is worth pointing out in this context that there is a controversy about the rates at which nsbh mergers do occur .",
    "bethe and brown ( 1998 ) argued that nsbh should merge about an order of magnitude more frequently than dns , while a recent study by pfahl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) comes to the conclusion that the number of nsbh systems in the galaxy should be below 1 % of the number of double neutron star systems . to date 8 dns",
    "have been observed ( stairs 2004 ) , while not a single nsbh binary has been discovered yet .",
    "+ neutron star black hole merger simulations have been performed by several groups .",
    "most of the simulations use newtonian or pseudo - newtonian gravity .",
    "janka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used a grid based hydrodynamics code together with a nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and a neutrino leakage scheme to explore the role of these mergers in grb context .",
    "lee ( 2000 , 2001 ) and lee and kluzniak ( 1999a , b ) used smoothed particle hydrodynamics with polytropic equations of state to explore the sensitivity of the results to the adiabatic exponent of the eos .",
    "lee and ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 ) have analyzed the flow pattern within an accretion disk around a bh and , in recent papers ( lee and ramirez - ruiz 2004 , lee et al .",
    "2005 ) , they included detailed microphysics in their simulations .",
    "setiawan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) constructed disks around stellar mass black holes and followed their evolution including explicit viscosity , rosswog et al .",
    "( 2004 ) investigated the dynamics of the accretion process .",
    "it is worth pointing out that both setiawan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) implicitly assume that interesting disks form whose properties they subsequently investigate whereas the focus of this investigation is the question whether / what kind of a disk forms during the merger .",
    "+ recently , there has been progress in the relativistic treatment black hole neutron star binaries .",
    "taniguchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , for example , have been constructing quasi - equilibrium black hole neutron star binaries in general relativity , and further efforts with approximate relativistic treatments seem to be underway ( rasio et al . 2005 ) . + stellar mass black holes formed in core collapse supernovae are thought to be born with masses ranging from about 3 to 20 ( fryer and kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have so far only explored black hole masses up to 14 ( janka et al . 1999 and lee and kluzniak 1999a , b and lee 2000 , 2001 used black holes up to 10 , rosswog et al .",
    "2004 explored masses up to 14 ) . in this paper",
    "we will focus on black holes with masses ranging from 14 to 20 .",
    "the 14 case has been explored previously ( rosswog et al . 2004 ) using the same microphysics but a purely newtonian bh - potential and may therefore serve to gauge the effect of the -wiita pseudo - potential . + a simple estimate for the radius where a star around a bh is disrupted is the tidal radius , r@xmath5 .",
    "as it grows slower with the black hole mass ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) than the gravitational radius ( @xmath6 m@xmath8 ) , it is expected that higher mass bhs will have more difficulties building up massive disks .",
    "therefore , the lower end of the black hole mass distribution is most promising for the launch of a grb .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to find suitable approximations for these cases , as here the space - time is far from a static schwarzschild / kerr solution and therefore neither the use of pseudo - potentials nor solving the hydrodynamics equations in a fixed background metric are admissible .",
    "for these cases fully dynamical general relativistic calculations are needed .",
    "+ in this paper we will explore the accretion dynamics and the observational signatures of the high mass end of these binary systems .",
    "we use a 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics code that has been developed to simulate compact objects .",
    "most of the code features have been described elsewhere ( rosswog et al .",
    "2000 , rosswog and davies 2002 , rosswog and liebendrfer 2003 ) and will only be briefly mentioned for the sake of completeness . for the simulations described here",
    "we have changed to an integration scheme with individual time steps and also the treatment of the black hole is different from the previous implementation . + in our implementation we have taken particular care to avoid artifacts from the use of artificial viscosity .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 that are usually used as fixed parameters in the artificial viscosity tensor ( monaghan and gingold 1983 ) , are made time dependent and evolved by solving an additional differential equation ( morris and monaghan 1997 ) . in the absence of shocks @xmath11 ( we always use @xmath12 ) , to be compared with the standard values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in strong shocks our @xmath9",
    "is allowed to rise up to values of 2 in order to avoid post - shock oscillations ( rosswog et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the balsara prescription ( balsara 1995 ) is used to avoid spurious forces in pure shear flows .",
    "thus , artificial viscosity is essentially absent unless a shock is detected .",
    "these measures have proved very effective , suppressing unwanted effects of artificial viscosity by orders of magnitude ( rosswog et al .",
    "2000 ; rosswog and davies 2002 ) .",
    "+ we use a temperature - dependent nuclear equation of state that is based on the tables provided by shen et al .",
    "( 1998a , 1998b ) and that has been smoothly extended to the low - density regime ( rosswog and davies 2002 ) .",
    "it covers a density range in @xmath15 from 0.5 to 15.4 , temperatures from 0 to 100 mev and electron fractions , @xmath16 , from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "the nucleons are treated in the framework of temperature - dependent relativistic mean field theory . at densities below about 1/3 of nuclear matter density nuclei",
    "will be present in the plasma .",
    "its composition is determined for fixed @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 from an equilibrium of nucleons , alpha particles and an average heavy nucleus .",
    "thus , energy release due to nuclear transmutations is accounted for in a simple way .",
    "contributions of photons and electrons / positrons of arbitrary degree of relativity and degeneracy are added to the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "details can be found in rosswog and davies 2002 .",
    "+ nowhere ( apart from the initial neutron stars ) @xmath10-equilibrium is assumed .",
    "local changes in the electron fraction and the thermal energy content of matter due to neutrinos are accounted for with a multi - flavor neutrino treatment ( rosswog and liebendrfer 2003 ) .",
    "+ the newtonian self - gravity of the neutron star fluid is calculated using a binary tree ( e.g. benz et al .",
    "this makes the star less compact and might -at least quantitatively- influence the accretion process .",
    "we use a -wiita potential to approximately take into account the presence of general relativistic effects around the black hole such as the presence of a last stable orbit . clearly , the use of the -wiita potential is not a complete substitute for fully fledged general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it has , however , turned out to be astonishingly accurate : test - particle orbits with @xmath19 6 m@xmath8 ( geometrical units with g = c=1 are used throughout the paper ) are unstable and orbits with @xmath19 4 m@xmath8 are unbound , i.e. the radius of marginally stable orbit is located at @xmath20= 6 m@xmath8 , and the radius of the marginally bound orbit is r@xmath21= 4 m@xmath8 .",
    "direct comparisons with general relativistic solutions in a schwarzschild space time show that the pseudo - potential is able to capture the essentials of general relativity and can reproduce accretion disk structures to an accuracy of better than 10 @xmath22 ( see e.g. artemova et al .",
    "the pseudo - potential does , however , not prevent velocities from becoming larger than unity .",
    "abramowicz et al . (",
    "1996 ) have suggested a rescaling of the velocities found using newtonian models together with the -wiita potential ( i.e. in our case the numerical velocities ) : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "they found this rescaling to reproduce the exact relativistic velocities to better than 5 % .",
    "this could be used , for example , to calculate doppler shifts , this rescaling is however nowhere used in this paper .",
    "+ the build up of the binary tree from scratch is computationally expensive , therefore we do not remove the particles that have crossed our inner boundary ( located at r@xmath25= 3 m@xmath8 ) at each time step .",
    "they are only removed when a dump is written , i.e. every @xmath26 s which is as short as 1/12 of the neutron star dynamical time scale and therefore does not lead to any artifacts ( this has been confirmed by removing particles every time step ) . to avoid numerical problems with the singularity of the -wiita potential",
    "we have extended it smoothly with a polynomial ( see appendix a and fig . [ denom ] ) .",
    "note that all particles that have ever encountered a deviation from the -wiita potential inside r@xmath25 will be removed at the next dump .",
    "+ we have implemented two different time integration schemes with individual time steps : a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg method ( fehlberg 1968 ) and a second - order predictor - corrector scheme . both of these schemes have been tested extensively against a runge - kutta - fehlberg scheme with a global time step .",
    "as the results were nearly indistinguishable the simulations were run with the predictor - corrector method as it only requires one force evaluation per time step .",
    "the most time consuming part of these simulations is the inspiral where ( due to the stiff neutron star eos and the resulting flat stellar density profile ) practically all particles have to be evolved on the shortest time step .",
    "the gain in speed for the presented calculations is moderate ( factors of a few ) , but in other test problems the code was faster by more than two orders of magnitude . + we construct our initial neutron stars by solving the lane - emden - equations for our eos with the additional constraint of ( cold ) @xmath10-equilibrium .",
    "this yields stellar radii of about 16 km for a 1.4 neutron star .",
    "all sph - particles have the same mass to avoid numerical noise arising from interactions of particles with unequal masses . prior to setting up the binary system the neutron stars are relaxed carefully by applying an additional , velocity proportional damping forces in the equations of motion so that the sph - particles can settle into their equilibrium positions .",
    "once such an equilibrium is obtained the ns - bh - binary system is set up , either with a tidally locked or a non - spinning neutron star .",
    "the locked systems are constructed accurately using the hydrocode itself ( see rosswog et al .",
    "the non - spinning neutron stars are set on orbit with an angular frequency determined by the force balance between centrifugal and gravitational forces . in all cases",
    "the radial velocity component of a point mass binary of the considered separation is added . + the simulations presented here use up to 3@xmath27 sph particles and are currently the best resolved models of neutron star black hole encounters ( rosswog et al .",

    "moreover , such disks will not provide powerful winds from neutrino ablation to collimate a possible outflow .",
    "therefore , the signal resulting from neutrino annihilation may be even less luminous .",
    "general relativistic effects like the bending of neutrino trajectories and the redshift of the neutrino energy may influence the result , but their influence goes in opposite directions and will change the non - relativistic results by only a factor of about two ( asano and fukuyama 2001 ) . recently , ramirez - ruiz and socrates ( 2005 ) have argued that neutrino spectra substantially different from black body may increase the overall explosion efficiency by more than an order of magnitude . but even if we stretch all of the available parameters to their most optimistic limits , e.g. assuming one order of magnitude more efficiency from neutrino spectra and an ( ad hoc ) extremely small beaming fraction @xmath80 , it is hard to see how the apparent isotropized luminosity should exceed , say , @xmath81 erg / s ( for about 10 ms ) even in the most promising cases of this study . +",
    "another agent that can possibly feed energy into collimated outflow is the magnetic field .",
    "being naturally endowed by strong magnetic fields to start with the shredding of a neutron star could be expected to be a good candidate for magnetic field amplification .",
    "this may occur via various pathways , the fastest of which is probably the magneto - rotational instability ( velikhov 1959 , chandrasekhar 1991 , balbus and hawley 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "[ beq ] shows the evolution of the disk - averaged magnetic field , @xmath82 making the extreme assumption that the field can reach equipartition field strength .",
    "here , the index @xmath83 runs over the particles inside 600 km ( see figure [ particles_in_disk ] ) around the hole , @xmath84 are the masses , @xmath85 the densities and @xmath86 the sound velocities of the sph - particles . under this assumption an average field strength slightly in excess of @xmath87 g would result . making the most optimistic assumptions",
    ", we will estimate the properties of the possibly resulting fireball ( see piran 1999 for a fireball review ) .",
    "the fireball energy is @xmath88 .",
    "this yields an initial fireball temperature of @xmath89 . the critical value @xmath90 , where @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 energy and mass of the fireball , is given by ( piran 1999 ) , @xmath94 .",
    "given the fact that the resulting disk is very thin and neutrino ablation not important , we consider it plausible that the fireball is in the electron opacity dominated range , @xmath95 .",
    "the fireball will thus become transparent to photons before it reaches the matter dominated stage .",
    "as the lorentz - factor grows @xmath96 and the fireball temperature drops @xmath97 , the observed temperature , @xmath98 , will be that of the initial fireball .",
    "this will yield a black body gamma - ray pulse with a temperature of about 3.3 mev . performing similar estimates for the fireball from",
    "neutrino annihilation yields a thermal pulse of about 2 mev .",
    "swift will have difficulties to detect it , but glast should be able to see a pulse of several tens of milliseconds out to a redshift of @xmath99 . + as mentioned previously , these estimates are based on most optimistic assumptions .",
    "as the material plunges into the hole within about one orbit once it has passed r@xmath100 , any instability will have difficulties to amplify the field by large factors .",
    "the expected thermal precursor pulse may therefore be even weaker than estimated above .",
    "+ in summary , none of the investigated systems seems to be an obvious candidate for the central engine of the observed short - hard grbs .",
    "neutron star black hole mergers may still be able to produce grbs",
    ". obviously , smaller mass black holes are more promising .",
    "technically , however , they are much more challenging as the neutron star has a mass comparable mass to the black hole and space - time is far from the schwarzschild solution .",
    "therefore , neither the use of pseudo - potentials nor simulations on a fixed background space - time are justified , here fully relativistic 3d simulations of the full merger process are required .",
    "+ the spin of the black hole may provide a possibility to launch grbs even from more massive black holes .",
    "if they are spinning very rapidly from the beginning and are spun up further during the merger to values close to the maximum spin parameter of @xmath101 then both the position of the last stable orbit and of the event horizon move to 1 m@xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ event_horizon ] .",
    "therefore , much higher temperatures and densities can be reached in the inner disk regions .",
    "the fraction of viable grb candidates among the nsbh systems obviously depends on their mass and initial bh spin distribution .",
    "both quantities are not observationally known and their predictions via population synthesis models are plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "it is however clear , that not the whole available parameter space will provide conditions that are favorable to launch grbs .",
    "this fact and the non - observation of even a single neutron star black hole system ( while eight double neutron star systems are observed ) makes it plausible that the observed short - hard grbs are dominated by double neutron star coalescences .",
    "+      in the investigated nsbh mergers we find very large amounts of radioactive material being ejected .",
    "the radioactive decay of this debris material would , like in a type ia supernova , power the post - coalescence lightcurve .",
    "the bulk of ejecta material stems from the initial nucleon fluid of the neutron star and will end up in large , possibly r - process , nuclei . if we assume a typical nuclear binding energy of @xmath3 8 mev per nucleon for the final nuclei , the decompression of this material will release , depending on the mass ratio of the nsbh system , between @xmath102 and @xmath103 erg from radioactive decays .",
    "the details of the resulting lightcurve will depend on the nuclear binding energies and decay time scales and their competition with the expansion of the material . as these nuclei will be extremely neutron rich ( see fig .",
    "[ ye_binned ] ) and far away from the valley of @xmath10-stability no experimental data for their half - lives are available and one would have to resort to theoretical predictions . for a simple estimate of the resulting electromagnetic transient from these radioactive ejecta we use the simple analytical estimate of li and ( 1998 ) who assumed spherical symmetry and a uniform distribution of nuclear lifetimes in logarithmic time intervals . scaling their results with the numbers found in our simulations",
    "we find that the peak luminosity of @xmath104 erg / s should be reached about 3 days after the coalescence ( the banana - like geometry may lead to a peak that occurs somewhat later than in the spherical model of li and ) .",
    "the effective temperature at peak will be @xmath105 k and result in an intensity maximum in the optical / near infrared band of the spectrum . + it is , however , worth pointing out that this result relies on radioactive nuclei still being present when the ejecta become optically thin , which depends on the details of the nuclear reaction path .",
    "it may also be possible that the decays have ceased already by that time and the result is an essentially dark explosion. this interesting topic definitely deserves further examination .",
    "+ in summary , the merger of a neutron star with a black hole of a mass beyond 14 may , rather than producing a gamma - ray burst , yield a supernova - like transient with a thermal precursor pulse peaking in the gamma - ray band .",
    "such a precursor of @xmath2 ms duration should be detectable with glast out to a redshift of @xmath99 .",
    "follow - up observations should then be able to detect a few days later the supernova - like transient .",
    "+ movies of the simulations can be found under + http://www.faculty.iu-bremen.de/srosswog/movies.html .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank marek abramowicz , jim lattimer , william lee , andrew macfadyen , enrico ramirez - ruiz , roland speith and christophe winisdoerffer for useful discussions and the infn in catania and the ias in princeton for their hospitality .",
