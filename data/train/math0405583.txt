    "we will prove theorem [ relputhm ] in a way modeled on pu s proof .",
    "the idea is to obtain estimates for an arbitrary metric in the conformal class of a hyperelliptic surface , by applying integral geometry to the quotient metric ( by the hyperelliptic involution ) on the 2-sphere .",
    "we start with a metric in the conformal class of an ovalless real hyperelliptic surface  @xmath50 of even genus  @xmath32 and area @xmath98 , and then proceed as follows .",
    "* step 1 : * in lemma [ 61 ] , we will show that we may assume that the commuting involutions @xmath33 and @xmath26 are isometries of our metric .",

    "the involution @xmath26 induces an orientation reversing isometry , denoted  @xmath102 , on @xmath36 which can be assumed to be the map that leaves the equator fixed and exchanges the northern and southern hemispheres . clearly , @xmath102 maps ramification points to ramification points , and hence there are @xmath103 of them in each hemisphere .",

    "we call a loop whose @xmath104-length @xmath105 an _ optimally short loop_. the loop we find lies in a hemisphere .",
    "in fact , we find a loop with a lift that is not closed , the sum of the winding numbers about the ramification points in the hemisphere is odd .",
    "note that this proves the theorem since the endpoints of such a lift would have to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 since the fact that @xmath11 is fixed by @xmath102 means that @xmath26 ( which has no fixed points ) must exchange the two ( distinct ) preimages of @xmath11 .",
    "it is often useful in the proof of sharp inequalities to keep in mind how the argument applies to spaces that are optimal or near optimal .",
    "we present such a discusson below , and also find some optimally short loops on these optimal surfaces .    a special role here",
    "is played by the simply connected 2-dimensional orbifold @xmath108 , which we will refer to henceforth as an ( american ) football , see figure  [ af ] , @xcite .",
    "it is the orbifold of constant curvature with a pair of conical singularities , each with total angle @xmath109 .",

    "here @xmath112 , with the usual coordinates @xmath113 .",
    "we have @xmath114 @xcite .    [ 71 ] the football admits the following two equivalent descriptions :    1 .   the orbifold @xmath108 is obtained from a round hemisphere by folding its boundary in two , using an identification on the boundary which is a reflection with 2 antipodal fixed points . 2 .",
    "the rotation by @xmath109 around the @xmath115-axis in @xmath116 gives rise to a ramified double cover @xmath117 , which is a local isometry away from the poles .",
    "furthermore , the orbifold metric @xmath110 can be expressed in terms of the standard metric by means of the following conformal factor : @xmath118 where @xmath119 as @xmath120 , while @xmath121 .",
    "the equivalence of the first two definitions is clear .",
    "let us relate the first definition to the third .",
    "we represent a hemisphere defining the orbifold as the upperhalf plane @xmath122 .",
    "then the orbifold can be viewed as a quotient of @xmath123 , where the positive and negative rays of the @xmath124-axis are identified .",
    "denote by @xmath125 the complex coordinate in  @xmath126 .    by the uniqueness of the underlying conformal structure",
    ", there exists a conformal map @xmath127 , identifying the orbifold with the 2-sphere , with complex coordinate @xmath115 . in our coordinates",
    ", we can represent @xmath128 by the map @xmath129 . here the singular points of the orbifold correspond to @xmath130 and  @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath132 , the metric @xmath111 pulls back under  @xmath128 to the quadratic differential @xmath133 , where @xmath134 note that @xmath111 restricted to @xmath126 is precisely the orbifold metric @xmath135 we are looking for . thus @xmath136 as required .    [ 82 ] the function @xmath137 is locally square integrable in  @xmath138 , which is important for our applications , proposition  [ 73 ] of appendix  [ bee ] .",
    "the football @xmath108 arises in the typical example where the associated systolic ratio is close to being optimal .",
    "thus , start with a round @xmath139 .",
    "attach a small handle .",
    "the orientable double cover @xmath6 can be thought of as the unit sphere in @xmath116 , with two little handles attached at north and south poles , at the two points where the sphere meets the @xmath115-axis .",
    "then one can think of the hyperelliptic involution @xmath140 as the rotation of @xmath6 by @xmath109 around the @xmath115-axis .",
    "the six weierstrass points are the six points of intersection of @xmath6 with the @xmath115-axis .",
    "the orientation reversing involution @xmath26 on @xmath6 is the restriction to  @xmath6 of the antipodal map in @xmath116 .",
    "the composition @xmath141 is the reflection fixing the @xmath142-plane , in view of the following matrix identity : @xmath143 meanwhile , the induced orientation reversing involution @xmath144 on @xmath36 can just as well be thought of as the reflection in the @xmath142-plane .",
    "this is because , at the level of the 2-sphere , it is `` the same thing as '' the composition @xmath141 .",
    "thus the fixed circle of @xmath144 is precisely the equator , formula  .",
    "then one gets a quotient metric on @xmath36 which is roughly that of the western hemisphere , with the boundary longitude folded in two , proposition  [ 71](2 ) .",
    "the metric has little bulges along the @xmath115-axis at north and south poles , which are leftovers of the small handle .",
    "in our case , the optimal metric is not round , so it is natural to consider geodesics on the football @xmath108 instead of the round sphere .",
    "the branched double cover @xmath145 of proposition  [ 71](2 ) pulls back @xmath110 to the standard metric @xmath111 on @xmath36 .",
    "this allows us easily to see the shape of the @xmath110-geodesics .",
    "they are of figure eight type with their point of self intersection on the equator ( except the ones through the poles ) , see figure  [ af ] .",
    "note also that the loop in each of the northern and southern hemispheres winds around the pole precisely once .",
    "starting with a square integrable function @xmath146 on @xmath108 , we can pull it back to @xmath36 and apply lemma  [ 73 ] to obtain the following .",
    "[ intgeomfootball ] there is a @xmath110-geodesic @xmath78 satisfying the following estimate : @xmath147    the factor of 2 comes from the fact that the area of the pull back of the ( possibly singular ) metric @xmath148 in @xmath36 ( under the double cover  @xmath149 ) has twice the area of the original metric .",
    "lemma  [ intgeomfootball ] implies the following .",
    "assume that our function @xmath150 is symmetric with respect to the inversion in the equator .",
