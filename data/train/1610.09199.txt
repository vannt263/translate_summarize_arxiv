    ", width=288 ]    the treatment of irreversible effects has been discussed extensively in the literature  in an `` extended forc '' distribution@xcite this function is added to the irreversible forc as a dirac delta function at zero coercivity . in this paper , however , we want to separate the reversible and irreversible behaviors . in a model system consisting of a single easy axis ( irreversible ) and a single hard axis ( reversible ) particle we would like to get a single dirac delta function in each of the irreversible and reversible forc distributions , each giving the properties of the corresponding particle .",
    "to this end , we note that a similar function has been used to extract anisotropy distributions of hard - axis systems@xcite . since @xmath52 is linear for a hard - axis particle ( fig . [ hard ] )",

    "note , however , that it does not give the joint distribution of @xmath54 and @xmath53 , in the way that @xmath76 gives the joint distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the most straightforward way to visualize the discrete irreversible forc distribution is to paint each plaquette with a color density proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "even if the data is noisy , so plaquettes with high density are next to ones with low density , this scheme takes advantage of the natural averaging capability of the human eye : if one looks at such a display from a little further way , the fluctuations average out , in a way that they would not if we used a color - coding other than density ( intensity ) .. however , most commercial visualization software is not designed to display uniform - color plaquettes : it wants to interpolate the color continuously , which in the present case just obscures the simplicity of the discrete distribution .",
    "for example , a very sharp peak will give density in only a single plaquette ",
    "this sharpness will be obscured by interpolation or averaging .    the only way to directly control the color of each plaquette is to code the visualization at the lowest level ",
    "currently all computer displays use opengl functions to display `` primitives '' ( triangles , in our case ) .",
    "accordingly , we are working on a c++ code that uses direct calls to opengl functions @xcite .",
    "it is well known that commercial visualization software that is usually used to visualize the forc distribution , which uses interpolation or extrapolation , can create artifacts , especially at the boundaries of the displayed region , which make it appear that there is a nonzero density when in fact it is almost zero .",
