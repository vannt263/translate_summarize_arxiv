    "the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ) was launched on 2002 february  5 and has since been returning high - quality x - ray and gamma - ray images and spectra of solar flares at energies between @xmath6  kev and 17 mev @xcite . here",
    "we present an analysis of _ rhessi _ observations of thermal spectra in the 410  kev range for 27 flares .",
    "this energy range includes thermal free  free and free  bound continua and two line features , one at @xmath0  kev referred to as the fe - line feature and the other at @xmath1  kev referred to as the fe / ni - line feature .",
    "both features are made up of lines ( resonance lines and satellite lines ) due principally to highly ionized ( mostly h - like , he - like , and li - like ) iron ( fe ) ions with the @xmath1-kev feature including some lines from highly ionized nickel .",
    "they are both clearly visible in _ rhessi _ flare spectra when the plasma temperature is @xmath7  mk .",
    "the spectral resolution of the _ rhessi _ detectors at these energies  @xmath8  kev fwhm  is inferior to that of crystal spectrometers ( e.g. the bent crystal spectrometer bcs on _ yohkoh _ ) , which typically have an energy resolution of a few ev , enough to resolve the satellite line structure in the 6.7  kev feature .",
    "however , most crystal spectrometers operating in this range can not measure the continuum very accurately since it is overwhelmed by a fluorescence background .",
    "also , because of their limited spectral coverage , they have generally not been used to detect the fe / ni line feature , apart from an early observation of @xcite .",
    "_ rhessi _ covers a much broader energy range and is able to measure both the two line features and the continuum emission .",
    "measurements with _",
    "rhessi _ of the ratios of the total emission in the fe - line feature to the nearby continuum , or more specifically the equivalent width , are possible .",
    "if nonthermal contributions to the continuum are negligible and if the continuum is emitted by an isothermal plasma with electron temperature @xmath3 and volume emission measure @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the emitting volume and @xmath11 the electron density ) , the slope of the logarithm of the continuum flux with energy @xmath12 gives @xmath3 , and the continuum flux at a particular energy gives the emission measure . in practice , we found that an isothermal approximation gives reasonably good fits to _ rhessi _ spectra at times after the maximum emission in soft x - rays ( @xmath13  kev ) , though not in general at earlier times .",
    "this is discussed further in  3 .",
    "for the 27 flares analyzed here , the observed equivalent widths of the fe - line feature as a function of @xmath3 were compared with the theoretical dependence determined from ion fractions , line excitation rates , and an assumed value for the fe abundance @xcite .",
    "thus , the fe abundance in flare plasmas can , in principle , be determined as a function of time for each flare .",
    "we often found differences between the temperature dependence of the theoretical and observed equivalent widths , which may be attributable to incorrect theoretical fe ion fractional abundances .",
    "this may show a need for the revision of ionization or recombination rate coefficients for highly ionized fe ions .",
    "preliminary results have already been given for a similar analysis of one flare by @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio of the fe - line feature to the fe / ni line feature is a function of @xmath3 alone , independent of the iron abundance , and _ rhessi _ measurements of this ratio during flares are the subject of a separate paper by @xcite .",
    "instrumental details of _ rhessi _ are given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the _ rhessi _ spectrometer consists of an array of nine cooled and segmented germanium detectors .",
    "x - ray imaging and spectroscopy up to several hundred kev are carried out using the 1-cm - thick front segments with the rear segments operated in anti - coincidence to reduce the background .",
    "imaging is achieved through the use of rotating modulation collimators located in front of the detectors , resulting in a time - modulated signal that can be analyzed to give spatial information . for 410  kev x - rays ,",
    "the energy resolution ( fwhm ) depends on the detector @xcite , ranging from @xmath14  kev for detectors 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 , @xmath1  kev for detector  2 , and @xmath6  kev for detector 7 .",
    "the lower - energy threshold for all detectors is set at 3  kev except for detectors 2 and 7 for which it was generally @xmath15  kev during the times of the observations we analyzed .",
    "the spectral output from individual detectors or the summed output of a combination of detectors may be analyzed independently .",
    "for our purposes , the output from detectors 2 and 7 must always be excluded as the lower - energy threshold exceeds the energies of interest .",
    "as indicated below , most of the analysis reported here was done with the output from detector  4 .",
    "each detector views the flare emission through four beryllium windows and four blankets of multilayer aluminized - mylar insulation .",
    "the absorption at the x - ray energies of interest here is dominated by the aluminized mylar . at high photon count rates encountered during flares , attenuators mounted in front of the detectors move into place to mitigate pulse pile - up and detector saturation problems that result from the large ( @xmath16 ) dynamic range in flare intensities detectable with _",
    "rhessi_. the attenuators consist of two sets of thin aluminum disks with one set thicker than the other .",
    "each disk has the same diameter as a detector front segment ( 6.15  cm ) to attenuate the solar photon flux that reaches the detector , but has a thinner circular region in the center to allow some low - energy transmission . under normal circumstances ,",
    "both sets of attenuators are held out of the detector lines of sight to the sun .",
    "this is referred to as the a0 attenuator state . as the x - ray counting rate from a flare increases above a prescribed level ,",
    "the ` thin ' attenuators are automatically inserted into the fields of view .",
    "this is called the a1 state .",
    "if the emission rises still further to another prescribed count rate level , then the ` thick ' attenuators are also inserted .",
    "this is called the a3 state .",
    "insertion of the thin and thick attenuators results in a reduction in count rate , particularly at low energies , since the transmission drops very steeply as a function of decreasing energy .",
    "the transmission fraction drops to 1% at @xmath17  kev in the a0 state , @xmath18  kev in the a1 state , and @xmath19  kev in the a3 state .",
    "estimates of the energy - dependent attenuation of the thin and thick attenuators are available from pre - launch measurements @xcite , and are incorporated in the _ rhessi _ analysis software package .",
    "the lowest energy photon flux that can be reliably determined in the different attenuator states depends not only on this increasing attenuation at the lower energies but also on k - escape processes .",
    "an incident photon with an energy above the germanium k - edge at 11.1  kev can ionize a germanium atom by ejecting one of its two k - shell electrons .",
    "there is a certain probability that the ionized atom will almost instantaneously emit a k@xmath20 photon at 9.25  kev or a k@xmath21 photon at 10.3  kev .",
    "these photons , in turn , may be absorbed in the detector front segment , thus giving a signal proportional to the full energy of the incident photon .",
    "alternatively , these secondary photons may escape from the detector so that the resulting signal is smaller than that expected for the given incident photon energy .",
    "these k - escape events appear in the count - rate spectrum at an energy equal to the incident photon energy minus the energy of the escaping k - line photon .",
    "since , in the a1 and a3 attenuator states , the attenuation at these low energies is very high , there are very few ` true ' counts recorded from incident photons with those energies . in fact",
    ", the number of k - escape events exceeds the number of true events at energies below 56  kev and no information can be obtained about the incident photon spectrum at these energies . in practice , for reasons at present unknown , there are usually more counts below 56  kev than predicted from our rather accurate knowledge of the k - escape phenomenon .",
    "consequently , we have limited our spectral fits for a1 and a3 to higher energies , i.e. @xmath22  kev , where the predicted and observed count rates can be made to agree for reasonable model parameters as indicated by the @xmath23 values .    at high photon count rates ,",
    "spectral distortion takes place because of  pulse pile - up . \"",
    "this arises because the instrument electronics are unable to separate the pulses produced by two photons arriving in a detector within a few @xmath24s of each other .",
    "the result is that the two photons are recorded as a single event with an energy that is as high as the sum of the energies of the two photons . in practice ,",
    "pulse pile - up begins to appear in the count - rate spectrum as excess counts at an energy roughly twice the energy of the peak count rate , i.e. at @xmath25  kev in the a0 state , @xmath26  kev in a1 , and @xmath27  kev in the a3 state .",
    "the analysis software allows some correction for pulse pile - up but with considerably increased uncertainty in the estimated temperature and emission measure .",
    "this is especially significant at times of increasing count rates immediately before the attenuators are inserted and times of decreasing count rates immediately after the attenuators are removed .",
    "another rate - dependent effect is a change in the energy calibration such that the apparent energy of the fe line at @xmath0  kev increases by up to 0.3  kev as the rate increases .",
    "this is probably a fixed increase in the electronics baseline so that the increase is independent of energy , as is verified by the stability of higher energy lines in the background spectrum of the front segments .",
    "thus , it is only significant at lower energies .",
    "nevertheless , it prevents us at present from exploiting the temperature diagnostic offered by the slight increase in the fe - line centroid energy with @xmath3 ( @xmath28  kev over @xmath29  mk : @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is further complicated by the fact that the detector count rates are rapidly modulated by the collimators as the spacecraft rotates .",
    "thus , in addition to the energy calibration changing at high rates , the effective energy resolution is degraded as well .    with the seven detectors usable for soft x - ray spectral analysis ( all but detectors 2 and 7 ) , we are able to check the measured sensitivities of each detector by comparing the derived photon spectra in each case for particular time intervals . in fig .",
    "[ multi_dets ] , we show the comparison of the derived photon spectra for a time interval when _ rhessi _ was in the a1 state .",
    "although the photon fluxes determined from the seven detectors independently agreed to better than @xmath26% at the higher end of the energy range chosen for analysis ( @xmath26  kev ) , the agreement at lower energies is less satisfactory .",
    "there was typically a factor 2.5 spread from the minimum to maximum derived photon fluxes at @xmath30  kev .",
    "this disagreement may be connected with increased uncertainties in the attenuation at low energies , which is a very steep function of energy , and with the origin of the excess counts over and above the k - escape events .",
    "most of the results in the remainder of this work are from spectra observed with detector  4 , which has relatively good spectral resolution ( fwhm @xmath31  kev ) and produces a photon spectrum close to the mean of all spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ multi_dets ] ) .",
    "analysis of _ rhessi _ flare spectra requires the reliable determination of background emission @xcite .",
    "all but 4 of the 27 flares chosen for analysis here had peak _ goes _ emission exceeding m1 , so near maximum , the flare soft x - ray count rates were at least a factor of 100 higher than the background rates at all the energies used in our fits , i.e. @xmath32  kev .",
    "however , spectra during periods late in each flare required taking the background spectrum into careful consideration .",
    "the background counts are due predominantly to the induced radioactivity of the detectors and to cosmic ray and trapped particle radiation .",
    "the rates vary over the spacecraft orbit , increasing toward higher north and south geomagnetic latitudes .",
    "the rates are also higher after leaving the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and during passages through precipitation events at high geomagnetic latitudes .",
    "the background energy spectrum is made up of a continuum and several lines .",
    "_ rhessi _ observations exist of many thousands of solar flares .",
    "we made a selection of flares using whole - sun x - ray light curves from _ goes _ having a reasonably long ( @xmath33  hour ) duration , particularly during the flare decay .",
    "the times of these flares were then checked against _ rhessi _",
    "data , removing those for which _ rhessi _ data were interrupted by spacecraft night periods , passages through the saa , or particle precipitation events . having determined that _ rhessi _ spectra in the a1 attenuator state gave the most reliable spectral fits ( see below ) , we gave priority to flares for which the decay stage was mostly in the a1 state .",
    "the resulting sample of 27 flares , although not complete by any particular criterion , does provide enough variety in terms of flare intensities and _ rhessi _ coverage for the scope of this paper .",
    "the _ rhessi _ data analysis software available in the solar software tree ( ssw ) requires that the spectral analysis be done in two stages . in the first stage , the _ rhessi _",
    "data files containing the raw time - ordered data covering the times of interest are read in and count rate spectra ( counts s@xmath34 per detector ) are extracted over user - supplied time intervals , energy ranges , and energy bins . for most of the flares analyzed here , detector  4 spectra were extracted for the reasons stated in  2 .",
    "the energy bins chosen were 1/3  kev wide ( the bin width of the telemetered data ) from 3  to  20  kev , and 1  kev wide from 20  to  100  kev .",
    "corrections are made by the software for detector live time and energy calibration .",
    "optionally , pulse pile - up corrections can be made .",
    "these are significant if the count rate exceeds @xmath35 counts  s@xmath34 , and were applied consistently in our analysis .",
    "however , it was found that these corrections were not adequate for some a0 spectra ; when this appeared to be the case , the higher bound of the energy range used for the spectral fits was taken to be a value shortward of the affected region .",
    "the output from this first stage of the analysis consists of two computer files , one containing the count rate spectra for the time intervals chosen by the user , the other containing the full spectrometer response matrix ( srm ) including the off - diagonal elements that account for photons detected at a lower energy than their true energy . in the second analysis stage ,",
    "the two output files from the first - stage are read by an object - oriented program known as the object spectral executive ( ospex ) . at this stage ,",
    "the background is subtracted and instrument - independent photon spectra are derived from the measured count - rate spectra .",
    "background subtraction is relatively simple for weaker flares where the attenuators remain in the a0 state , but becomes more complicated when the attenuator state changes during the flare of interest . for flares in the a0 state , short intervals before and/or after the flare were used to obtain a background spectrum .",
    "linear or low - order polynomial interpolation between these background intervals in different energy ranges can give a reliable prediction of the background during the flare as long as periods of particularly high background levels are avoided .",
    "the selection of the background spectrum to subtract is usually more difficult in the a1 and a3 attenuator states , however .",
    "this is because there is usually no time period available either before or after the flare in the same attenuator state that can be used to give the background spectrum _ in that state_. there is often low - level x - ray emission from somewhere on the sun both before and after the flare of interest that is detected in the a0 state but gives a much lower count rate in the a1 or a3 states . in such cases",
    ", we used the simplest approach of taking the spectrum measured during the nighttime part of the orbit since then there can be no solar emission enhancing the background .",
    "these background concerns are only important for times when the estimated background count rates at any given energy are greater than about 10% of the measured count rate from the flare .",
    "with the background spectrum subtracted , the program proceeds iteratively to find the parameters of a user - selectable model photon spectrum that best fits the data for each time interval . after deciding on the components of the model photon spectrum and reasonable starting parameters",
    ", the program uses the spectral response matrix to calculate the count rate spectrum that would be produced by the model photon spectrum .",
    "this calculated spectrum is then compared with the measured background - subtracted count - rate spectrum and a @xmath23 value is obtained .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted and the process repeated until a minimum value of @xmath23 is obtained . if the value of the reduced @xmath23 ( @xmath23 divided by the number of degrees of freedom ) is @xmath36 , then the best - fit parameters can be considered to be acceptable for the particular assumed model photon spectrum .",
    "the model photon spectrum we used included the thermal free - free and free - bound continuum , a multiple power - law function for the nonthermal component ( when present ) , and up to three lines with gaussian profiles for the fe - line feature , the fe / ni line feature , and a residual instrumental line at @xmath37  kev ( see below ) . in the version of ospex that we used , the model thermal photon spectra are from the mekal @xcite spectral code with solar coronal element abundances from @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , an isothermal assumption ( single values of @xmath3 and emission measure ) was made .",
    "this is not likely to be a particularly close approximation for the rising and peak stages of most flares , but as we shall see it is a good approximation for many flares in their decay stages . in the future",
    ", we intend to use more generalized analysis techniques with temperature - dependent ( i.e. differential ) emission measures .",
    "we fitted the observed count rate spectra by taking the continuum function of the mekal code with first - guess values for @xmath3 ( to define the energy dependence of the continuum ) and emission measure ( to define the flux at a particular energy ) and with gaussian line features at energies of @xmath0  kev and @xmath38  kev with first - guess total fluxes to approximate the fe line and fe / ni line features .",
    "these line energies are approximately the theoretical values for @xmath39  mk . the line widths were generally taken to be 0.1  kev ( fwhm ) to match the energy range of the groups of lines forming each feature ; the exact widths are usually irrelevant as they are much less than the spectral fwhm resolution of @xmath14  kev for detector  4 . however , at very high count rates , the line widths were allowed to float also to allow for the slight degradation of spectral resolution .",
    "the goodness of fit measured by the reduced @xmath23 requires estimated uncertainties , both statistical ( i.e. in the count rates ) and systematic .",
    "the default value for the systematic uncertainties of 5% in the software was used in this analysis ; decreasing this value in general has little effect on the best - fit spectral parameters .    for most of the 27 flares analyzed , we examined spectra over a time range which generally included the rise phase , the flare maximum , and the flare decay phase for times when _ rhessi _ was making solar observations .",
    "spectra in the a0 state were fitted over an energy range approximately 410  kev , so avoiding any pulse pile - up peak at @xmath40  kev .",
    "_ rhessi _ continuum spectra early in the flare rise phase in the a0 attenuator state were often poorly fitted ( as shown by the reduced @xmath23 ) with isothermal spectra from the mekal code .",
    "the agreement became progressively worse for higher count rates until the attenuator state changed to a1 .",
    "there are three possible reasons for this : ( 1 ) the presence of non - isothermal emitting plasma early in the flare ; ( 2 ) the degradation of spectral resolution at high count rates (  2 ) ; ( 3 ) the worsening goodness of fit at higher count rates owing to the decrease in statistical uncertainties of the data points .",
    "again , for flares in the a1 attenuator state , fits to observed spectra in the rise phase of the flare gave higher @xmath23 than fits during the flare decay , when reduced @xmath41 could usually be achieved .",
    "the energy range of the a1 spectral fits were from 5.7 or 6.0  kev to 14  kev or more .",
    "because of the strong attenuation below @xmath42  kev and the k - escape events mentioned above , no information can be obtained about the incident photon spectrum at lower energies .",
    "many of the results given here are for flares in their decay stage when _ rhessi _ was in the a1 state .    in the a3 attenuator state",
    ", there was often a poor fit .",
    "a significant reason for this is the appearance of the instrumental line feature at about 10  kev , so a total of three lines with gaussian shapes must be included in the fit .",
    "the @xmath37  kev line feature may be due to incorrectly subtracted ge k - line emission following radioactive decay of the detector ge or possibly l@xmath21 line emission from the tungsten collimators in front of detectors 29 .",
    "part of the line feature at @xmath1  kev that we have attributed to the fe / ni line feature may be the tungsten l@xmath20 line at 8.4  kev .",
    "another factor possibly contributing to the poor fits obtained in the a3 state is that flares are often near their maximum at those times .",
    "it is likely that the emitting plasma departs from being isothermal , causing our isothermal model to give poor fits .",
    "the energy range of the fits to a3 spectra was generally 5.7 or 6.0  kev to as high as 30  kev , thus avoiding the pile - up peak at @xmath43  kev .",
    "figures [ a0_spectrum ] , [ a1_spectrum ] , and [ a3_spectrum ] show examples of fits to _ rhessi _ count rate spectra in the a0 , a1 , and a3 attenuator states during the m2.1 flare of 2003 april  26 .",
    "this flare had two peaks ( at 03:05 and 03:10  u.t . ) , and the x - ray emission is on the decay of a previous large flare .",

    "some 27 flares were selected from the _ rhessi _ data set , chosen for their relatively long durations so that repeated measurements of the fe line equivalent could be made , particularly during their decay stages .",
    "measurements of the fe line equivalent width were made from these fits to the observed spectra , and plots made for each flare of the equivalent width against @xmath3 .",
    "comparison was made with an updated version of the theoretical curve from @xcite , which assumes the coronal abundance of fe ( fe / h @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 photospheric ) derived by @xcite . for only one flare ( no .",

    "agreement between the observations and theory for these four flares could be achieved if the coronal relative abundance of fe were multiplied by 0.8 ( i.e. fe / h @xmath61 or @xmath62 photospheric ) .",
    "a more common characteristic is for the observed equivalent widths to rise with @xmath3 , exceeding the theoretical curve at @xmath63  mk . with a3 spectral results",
    "included , the equivalent width for a few flares rises to a value of @xmath1  kev , more than double the maximum of the theoretical curve .",
    "if the a3 points are disregarded , the observed points rise to a value of slightly more than 4  kev . the observed equivalent widths increase with @xmath3 more sharply than is predicted by the theoretical curve , with a clear displacement to higher temperatures being indicated .",
    "these results are not so easily explained .",
    "if the isothermal approximation is a good one for spectra during these flares , as is indicated by the reduced @xmath23 values , then possibly this behavior could indicate the need for a correction to the ionization fractions of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the displacement indicates that the value of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 the number density of he - like fe and @xmath66 the number density of all fe ions ) should be lower than is calculated for the temperature range @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite suggested corrections to the @xmath68 ratio based on _ solar maximum mission _ crystal spectrometer data .",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the rate coefficient of ionizations from fe@xmath71 and @xmath72 the rate coefficient of recombinations to fe@xmath73 , both functions of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite argued that , since the various theoretical rate coefficients of ionization from the fe@xmath71 available then had more scatter than the rate coefficients of recombinations to fe@xmath73 , and that the recombination rates were more slowly varying with @xmath3 than the ionization rates , the ionization rates were more likely to require revision than the recombination rates .",
    "the ionization rate coefficients in the work of @xcite are based on analytical formulae that are known to be a good representation of measured data for ions up to fe@xmath74 @xcite .",
    "however , there is a need for the inclusion of ionization fractions based on experimental data for ionization rates from fe@xmath71 and other ions , now available ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the number density of fe@xmath73 ions being too small compared with that of lower stages like fe@xmath71 , but it is difficult to explain why the temperature displacement varies from flare to flare , as found here .",
    "possibly non - equilibrium effects play a role , but this is unlikely in view of the probable high densities ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) of the emitting plasma , as was shown by @xcite .",
    "the tendency of fe - line feature equivalent widths to agree better with theory for periods when flares are in their declining stage and _ rhessi _ is in its a1 attenuator state is probably due to the flares having a more nearly isothermal state in their decay .",
    "this has also been found from temperature measurements using and line ratios using the bragg crystal spectrometer on the _ yohkoh _ spacecraft @xcite .",
    "flares probably depart most strongly from an isothermal state in their early and peak stages , when images ( particularly those from _ rhessi _ and the _ trace _ 195    filter : @xcite , @xcite ) show emission in loop - top structures at high temperatures in close proximity with loop structures with much lower temperatures . the general lack of agreement of fe line feature equivalent widths observed late in flare developments by _ rhessi _ in the a0 state is therefore unexpected on this basis , but this appears to be due , at least occasionally , to the degraded spectral resolution at high count rates and the difficulty of distinguishing the line feature at low count rates and at low temperatures .",
    "multi - thermal flare plasmas are being investigated and will be the subject of a further analysis of _ rhessi _ flare spectra .",
    "differential emission measures , dem @xmath77 , can be extracted from spectral line fluxes and other data .",
    "procedures like the pintofale code @xcite and demon @xcite are currently being compared , using spectral data from _ rhessi _ , the _ coronas - f _ resik crystal spectrometer , _ goes _ , and other broad - band data .",
    "simpler procedures using analytical forms for dem are also being tried , such as dem @xmath78 exp@xmath79 ( @xmath80 is a constant for a particular time ) , since resik data for dielectronic satellite line intensity ratios show that such a function is an improvement over an isothermal approximation @xcite .",
