    "in the past decades , there has been great progress in hadron spectroscopy thanks to the unprecedented data sample accumulated by the b factories and hadron - hadron colliders .",
    "a number of charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states have been discovered on these experimental facilities so far but not all of them can be placed in the ordinary @xmath9 ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 is the first and perhaps the most renowned exotic candidate .",
    "it was first discovered in 2003 by belle in the @xmath10 final state  @xcite and subsequently confirmed by the babar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "complementary observation is also found in proton - proton / antiproton collisions at the tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . though the existence is well established , the nature of the @xmath1 is still ambiguous due to a few peculiar properties .",
    "first , compared to typical hadronic widths the total width is tiny .",
    "only an upper bound has been measured experimentally : @xmath11 mev  @xcite .",
    "the mass lies closely to the @xmath12 threshold , @xmath13  mev  @xcite , which leads to speculations that the @xmath1 is presumably a meson - meson molecular state  @xcite .",
    "these peculiar features have stimulated considerable research interest in investigating the production and decays of the @xmath1 towards understanding its nature .",
    "a very important aspect involves the discrimination of a compact multiquark configuration and a loosely bound hadronic molecule configuration . in this viewpoint",
    ", it would be also valuable to look for the analogue in the bottom sector , referred to as @xmath0 following the notation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , as states related by heavy quark symmetry may have universal behaviours .",
    "since the @xmath0 is expected to be very heavy and its @xmath14 of is @xmath15 , it is less likely for a direct discovery at the current electron - positron collision facilities , though the super kekb may provide an opportunity in @xmath16 radiative decays  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the production of the @xmath0 at the lhc and the tevatron has been investigated , along the same line with the studies on the search for exotic states at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the production rates at the lhc and the tevatron are sizeable  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the search for the @xmath0 also depends on reconstructing the @xmath0 , which motivates us to study the @xmath0 decays . since this meson is expected to be far below threshold , the isospin violating decay mode for instance @xmath17 is highly suppressed , and this may explain the escape of @xmath0 in the recent cms search  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "radiative decays of the @xmath0 will be of high priority , on which we will focus in this paper .",
    "as we will show in the following , these modes have sizeable decay widths .    to calculate the radiative decays , we study the intermediate meson loop contributions , which have been one of the important nonperturbative transition mechanisms in various transitions , and their impact on the heavy quarkonium transitions , also referred to as coupled - channel effects ,",
    "has been noticed for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate meson loops mechanism has been applied to study the production and decays of ordinary and exotic states  @xcite and b decays  @xcite , and a global agreement with experimental data is found .",
    "thus this approach may be an effective approach to handle the @xmath0 radiative decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formula ] , we will introduce the formalism used in this work . based on this framework ,",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and the summary will be given in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "with the @xmath18 as the intermediate states.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the calculation of contributions from the meson loops requests the leading order effective lagrangian . based on the heavy quark symmetry",
    ", we employ the relevant effective lagrangian for the @xmath19  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the bottom meson isodoublets .",
    "@xmath23 is the anti - symmetric levi - civita tensor and @xmath24 . due to the heavy quark symmetry ,",
    "the following relationships of the couplings are valid  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the mass and decay constant of @xmath19 , respectively . the decay constant @xmath28 can be extracted from the @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant . using the masses and leptonic decay widths of the @xmath19 states : @xmath32 kev , @xmath33 kev , @xmath34 kev  @xcite , one can obtain @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 mev , and @xmath37 mev .",
    "we consider the iso - scalar @xmath0 as a @xmath38-wave molecular state with the positive charge parity given by the superposition of @xmath39 and @xmath40 hadronic configurations as latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the light quark charge matrix , @xmath51 is an unknown parameter and @xmath52 is the heavy quark electric charge ( in units of @xmath53 ) . in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model @xmath54 gev@xmath55 , which has been adopted in the study of radiative @xmath56 decays  @xcite .",
    "note heavy quark symmetry ensures that @xmath51 is the same in the @xmath57 and @xmath58 systems , so we take the same value as ref .",
    "the first term is the magnetic moment coupling of the light quarks , while the second one is the magnetic moment coupling of the heavy quark and hence is suppressed by @xmath59 .",

    "[ fig : loops ] can be expressed in a generic form in the effective lagrangian approach as follows , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the vertex functions and the denominators of the intermediate meson propagators .",

    "[ fig : loops ] ( a ) , @xmath63 are the vertex functions for the initial @xmath0 , final bottominum and photon , respectively .",
    "@xmath64 are the denominators for the intermediate @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath65 propagators , respectively . in addition",
    ", we introduce a dipole form factor , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and the qcd energy scale @xmath69 mev .",
    "this form factor is supposed to compensate the off - shell effects arising from the intermediate exchanged particle and the non - local effects of the vertex functions  @xcite , and phenomenological studies have suggested @xmath70 .",
    "the explicit expression of the transition amplitudes can be found in appendix ( a.6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , where radiative decays of charmonium are studied extensively based on the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0 was predicted in both the tetraquark model  @xcite and hadronic molecular calculations  @xcite .",

    ", we can see that the widths for the @xmath89 radiative decays are about @xmath8 kev .",
    "it is noteworthy to recall that the upper bound for the @xmath90 is @xmath91 mev  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath89 were similarly narrow , our results would indicate a sizeable branching fractions , at least @xmath92 , for these radiative decay modes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthonexb ] , we present the partial widths for the @xmath93 ( panel a ) , @xmath94 ( panel b ) , and @xmath95 ( panel c ) in terms of the @xmath75 with @xmath76 ( solid lines ) and @xmath96 ( dashed lines ) , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties caused by the cutoff parameter indicate our limited knowledge on the applicability of the effective lagrangian .",
    "however fortunately the @xmath88 dependence of the partial widths are not drastically sensitive , which indicates a reasonable cutoff of the ultraviolet contributions by the empirical form factors . in this figure",
    ", there exists an evident enhancement structure around @xmath97 mev resulting from the cusp effect . as can be seen from this figure , this enhancement structure is independent of the cutoff parameter @xmath88",
    ".    it would be interesting to further clarify the uncertainties arising from the introduction of the form factors by studying the ratios between different partial decay widths .",
    "we define the following ratios @xmath98 which are plotted in fig .  [ fig:3 ] for the dependence on the cutoff parameter and fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_mass_r ] for the dependence on binding energy .",
    "since the first coupling vertices are the same for those decay channels when taking the ratio , so the ratio only reflects the open threshold effects through the intermediate bottomed meson loops .",
    "the ratios are less sensitive to the cutoff parameter , which is a consequence of the fact that the involved loops are the same . as can be seen from this figure , when the cutoff parameter @xmath88 increases , the ratios decrease .",
    "these predictions can be tested by the experimental measurements in future .",
    "our understanding of hadron spectroscopy will be greatly improved by studies of exotic states that may defy the conventional models of @xmath99 meson spectroscopy , and accordingly great progress has been made in the past decades .",
    "one of the most important aspects in the study of exotics is the discrimination of a compact multiquark configuration and a loosely bound hadronic molecule .",
    "such task requests a large amount of efforts on both experimental and theoretical sides in future .    in this work ,",
    "we have investigated the radiative decays of the @xmath0 , the counterpart of the famous @xmath1 in the bottomonium - sector as a candidate for meson - meson molecule , into the @xmath2 .",
    "since this state may be far below the @xmath6 threshold , the isospin violating decay mode @xmath17 would be highly suppressed , and stimulate the importance of the radiative decays .",
    "we have made used of the effective lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry , and explore the rescattering mechanism .",
    "our results have shown that the partial widths for the @xmath100 are about @xmath8 kev , and thus the branching fractions may be sizeable , taking into account the fact the total width may also be smaller than a few mev like @xmath1 .",
    "this study of radiative decays and the previous work on production rates in hadron - hadron collisions have indicated a promising prospect to find the @xmath0 at hadron collider in particular the lhc , and we suggest our experimental colleagues to perform an analysis .",
    "such attempt will likely lead to the discovery of the @xmath0 and thus enrich the exotics garden in the heavy quarknoium sector .",
