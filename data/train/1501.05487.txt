    "curvature can be expressed both in metric and combinatorial terms .",
    "metrically , one can refer to nonpositively curved ( respectively , negatively curved ) metric spaces in the sense of aleksandrov , i.e. by comparing small triangles in the space with triangles in the euclidean plane ( hyperbolic plane ) .",
    "these are the cat(0 ) ( respectively , cat(-1 ) ) spaces .",
    "combinatorially , one looks for local combinatorial conditions implying some global features typical for nonpositively curved metric spaces .    a very important combinatorial condition of this type was formulated by gromov @xcite for cubical complexes , i.e.  cellular complexes with cells being cubes .",
    "namely , simply connected cubical complexes with links ( that can be thought as small spheres around vertices ) being flag ( respectively , @xmath2large , i.e.  flag - no - square ) simplicial complexes carry a canonical cat(0 ) ( respectively , cat(-1 ) ) metric .",
    "another important local combinatorial condition is local @xmath3largeness , introduced by januszkiewicz- ' swiatkowski @xcite and haglund @xcite .",
    "a flag simplicial complex is _ locally @xmath3large _ if its links do not contain ` essential ' loops of length less than @xmath3 . in particular , simply connected locally @xmath4large simplicial complexes , i.e.  _ @xmath4systolic _ complexes , are gromov hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "the theory of _",
    "@xmath4systolic groups _ , that is groups acting geometrically on @xmath4systolic complexes , allowed to provide important examples of highly dimensional gromov hyperbolic groups @xcite .",
    "however , for groups acting geometrically on cat(-1 ) cubical complexes or on @xmath4systolic complexes , some very restrictive limitations are known .",
    "for example , @xmath4systolic groups are in a sense ` asymptotically hereditarily aspherical ' , i.e.  asymptotically they can not contain essential spheres .",
    "this yields in particular that such groups are not fundamental groups of negatively curved manifolds of dimension above two ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this rises need for other combinatorial conditions , not imposing restrictions as above . in @xcite",
    "some conditions of this type are studied  they form a way of unifying cat(0 ) cubical and systolic theories . on the other hand , osajda @xcite introduced a local combinatorial condition of _ @xmath0location _ , and used it to provide a new solution to thurston s problem about hyperbolicity of some @xmath5manifolds .    in the current paper",
    "we undertake a systematic study of a version of @xmath0location , suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 5.1 ) .",
    "this version is in a sense more natural than the original one ( tailored to thurston s problem ) , and none of them is implied by the other .",
    "however , in the new @xmath0location we do allow essential @xmath6loops .",
    "this suggests that it can be used in a much wider context .",
    "roughly ( see section @xmath7 for the precise definition ) , the new @xmath0location says that essential loops of length at most @xmath0 admit filling diagrams with at most one internal vertex .",
    "we show that this local combinatorial condition is a negative - curvature - type condition , by proving the following main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath8 be a simply connected , @xmath0located simplicial complex .",
    "then the @xmath9skeleton of @xmath8 , equipped with the standard path metric , is gromov hyperbolic .",
    "the above theorem was announced without a proof in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 5.1 ) . in (",
    "* subsection 5.2 ) applications concerning some weakly systolic complexes and groups are mentioned .",
    "our proof consists of two steps . in theorem",
    "[ 3.2 ] we show that an @xmath0located simplicial complex satisfying a global condition @xmath1 ( see definition [ def-2.2 ] ) is gromov hyperbolic . then , in theorem [ 4.1 ] we show that the universal cover of an @xmath0located complex satisfies the property @xmath1 .",
    "the main theorem [ 4.2 ] follows immediately from those two results . for proving theorem",
    "[ 4.1 ] we use a method of constructing the universal cover introduced in @xcite , and then developed in @xcite .",
