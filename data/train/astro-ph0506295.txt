    "x - ray heating of three regions is generally believed to contribute to optical variability in low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems .",

    "most lmxbs the reprocessed x - ray optical flux dominates the optical light from the rest of the system ( van paradijs 1983 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) , particularly in the outburst phase .",
    "the companion itself may only be evident at a very faint level when the system is in quiescence .",
    "more recently it has become apparent that synchrotron emission from matter flowing out of the system via bipolar jets makes a highly variable contribution to radio and ir emission from many different classes of x - ray binaries ( fender 2003 ) . in some cases",
    "this emission may extend into the optical region ( hynes et al .",

    "xte j0929314 is one of the faintest transients to be found by the asm experiment on _ rxte _ and this detection was only possible due to its angular distance from the galactic centre region which minimises bright source confusion and consequent positional uncertainties .",

    "the transient was discovered near the time of peak x - ray flux , towards the end of april .",

    "greenhill et al ( 2002 ) reported variability of up to @xmath14 magnitudes on the first night ( hjd 396 ) of our observations .",
    "preliminary analysis suggested that a short duration ( timescale @xmath15 minutes ) @xmath14 magnitude flare occurred in _ v _ on this night .",
    "subsequently we became aware of water vapour condensation on the filter during this `` event '' and we are now doubtful of the reality of the flaring . in the following section we describe evidence for a low amplitude orbital period modulation seen in the _ i _ band flux at about hjd 397 .",
    "it is of interest to note that no significant variations were seen in x - rays during the _ rxte _ pca observations ( galloway et al .",
    "the upper limit to the orbital period modulation of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux was @xmath16 per cent ( 3@xmath17 ) ( juett et al .",

    "3 we plot the mean _ b - v _ and _ v - i _ colour indices for the nights when these three colours were measured . in order to minimise the effects of source variability the colour indices for each night",
    "are derived from one or more measurements in the different colours taken within a time interval of @xmath0 1 hour .",
    "the overall trend was for the spectrum to become hotter ( more blue ) over the principal five weeks of observation .",
    "this suggests , assuming that most of the light comes from an accretion disc , a trend towards increasing disc temperature as the accreting matter diffuses inwards .",
    "there was also a brief decrease in _ b - v _ & _ v - i _ ( increase in colour temperature ) between 2002 may 1 and may 4 ( hjd 396 - 399 ) , followed by a recovery to the overall trend line .",
    "this can be seen in fig . 2 where , for the first few days following optical identification , the _",
    "i _ band flux _ decreased _",
    "slightly while fluxes in the other bands _ increased_.    the light curves in _ bvri _ are approximately triangular in profile , on a linear scale , and similar to , but delayed by , @xmath0 13 days relative to the x - ray light curve . during the time interval may 1 to may 11 ( hjd 396 - 406 ) the _ bvri _ fluxes _ increased _ by @xmath18 per cent while the x - ray flux _ decreased _ by @xmath19 per cent .",
    "we can think of no physical process whereby x - ray emission can _ lead optical emission by 13 days . in sax j1808.43658 ,",

    "may 2 , 3 & 4 ( hjd 397 , 398 & 399 ) we monitored the object at _",
    "i _ continuously in an attempt to observe an orbital period modulation .",
    "these data are plotted in fig .",
    "- may galloway et al .",
    "( 2002a ) detected a 2614.75(15 ) s orbital period modulation of the x - ray pulsation frequency .",
    "no amplitude modulation of the x - ray flux was detected .",
    "their orbit ephemeris placed the neutron star on the far side of the companion at 2002 may 11.4941(2 ) ut ( hjd 405.9941 ) . the solid sine curves in the lower part of each panel in fig .",
    "4 represent the modulation ( arbitrary amplitude ) expected from x - ray heating of the companion star as in sax j1808.43658 ( see fig . 1 in giles et al .",
    "1999 and fig . 2 in homer",
    "et al . 2002 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we also show the light curves for a nearby constant comparison star ( @xmath22 to the nnw in fig . 1 , _ i _ mag 17.11 ) which has been shifted by an arbitary amount",
    ". this star does not show the modulation evident for xte j0929314 in the top panel .",
    "all three observing runs terminated close to the telescope elevation limit but the source exhibits significant variability which is not apparent for the plotted comparison star or for others not shown here .",
    "the light curve for the last four hours of the night of may 2 ( hjd 397 ) shows clear indications of modulation at or near the orbital period together with slow changes in the average magnitude .",
    "we corrected the data commencing from hjd 396.92 ( @xmath23h ut ) for these slow changes using a second order polynomial and used the q method ( warner & robinson , 1972 ) to search the de - trended data for periodicity in the range 0.01 to 0.05 days . there is a strong single peak corresponding to a period of @xmath24 days .",
    "this is consistent with the orbital period of 0.030263 days discovered by galloway et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .    in fig . 5 .",
    "we plot the corrected light curve folded at the x - ray period and ephemeris where phase zero is defined as the time when the companion is at its greatest distance from the observer i.e. it lies beyond the neutron star .",
    "the vertical error bars are those generated by the dophot photometry which appear to be slightly over - estimated . to clarify this we repeated the phase folding process for the nearby comparison star , using the same x - ray ephemeris , so that the real scatter for a constant source can be seen .",
    "these points are plotted in the lower part of fig . 5 and have a slightly different offset to that used in fig .",
    "the formal dophot average error for these 22 points is 0.021 mag but they have a @xmath25 scatter of only 0.017 mag so the xte j0929314 error bars in figs . 4 & 5 are probably @xmath0 20 per cent too large .",
    "the modulation is approximately sinusoidal with amplitude @xmath26 magnitudes peak to peak and maximum at phase @xmath27 .",
    "hence the modulation is unlikely to be due to x - ray heating of the companion as this would have maximum light at phase zero . in this respect xte j0929314",
    "differs from sax j1808.43658 in which the orbital period optical modulation had a maximum at phase zero ( giles et al . , 1999 ) . nor is it likely that the modulation is due to emission from a hot spot on the disc since this would have a maximum at a phase between @xmath28 .",
    "perhaps both processes contribute .",
    "the first pca x - ray observation ( obs . 01 - 00 ) occurred during the time we detected an orbital period modulation on the night of 2002 may 2 ( hjd 397 ) and its duration is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "however , this observation consists of crossed slews to determine the x - ray source position and is thus not suitable for modulation analysis .",
    "as noted earlier , no x - ray amplitude modulation was reported in any of the many following _ rxte _ pca observations ( juett et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "there are many occasions within tables 2 & 3 where we have _ bvri _ values on the same night but some caution is required in combining these into broadband spectra due to the variability detected on several nights . in most instances",
    "the different colour averages for each night are derived from one or more measurements taken in a time interval of @xmath0 1 hour .",
    "it should be clearly noted that the central wavelength and bandwidth for the _ r _ & _ i _ filters differs between the cousins and older johnston systems and this can affect the apparent spectral shape .",
    "here we use the cousins _ r _ & _ i _ parameters . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the broadband _ bvri _ spectra from 8 nights , 2002 may 1 , 4 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 19 & june 1 , 7 ( hjd 396 , 399 , 406 , 408 , 409 , 414 , 427 & 432 )",
    ".    also shown is a curve representing a power law approximation to the emission from an optically thick , x - ray heated disc .",
    "the distribution is given by the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the reddened flux at wavelength @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wavelength dependent reddening correction toward the source .",
    "the amplitude is arbitrary and the spectrum is reddened assuming interstellar extinction @xmath33 .",
    "this value is scaled from the estimated value @xmath34 for sax j1808.43658 ( wang et al . , 2001 ) using the integrated column densities , @xmath35 for sax j1808.43658 ( gilfanov et al . , 1998 ) and @xmath36 for xte j0929314 ( juett et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "a similar value for @xmath37 is obtained by using the relationship between @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have no information on the flux in _ b _ for the first night ( hjd 396 ) but it is clear that the spectrum was heavily reddened on that occasion . on subsequent nights",
    "the spectra were generally steeper and had an approximately power law distribution .",
    "there was , however , a highly variable red excess above the power law .",
    "the excesses are not sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath37 . on hjd 399",
    "the excess was near zero ( similar to the canonical disc power law distribution ) and , as noted in section 3.3 , the spectrum was anomalously blue .",
    "on hjd 409 ( and possibly hjd 432 although with less statistical significance ) the _ r _ band was strongly enhanced consistent with strong balmer line ( @xmath39 ) emission .",
    "balmer emission can not however account for the variable excesses in _ i_. measurements errors were relatively large for the last two nights in fig . 6 ( hjd 427 and 432 ) but it is clear that the red excess had disappeared and that the spectra were steeper ( bluer ) than during earlier observations .",
    "several features distinguish xte j0929314 from sax j1808.43658 .",
    "firstly , the maximum of the orbital period modulation occurs at phase @xmath27 rather than at phase zero .",
    "this points to an origin of x - ray heating in sax j1808.43658 but the situation is more complex in xte j0929314 .",
    "galloway et al . ( 2002b ) have shown that the companion in xte j0929314 is probably a very low mass ( @xmath40 ) helium white dwarf .",
    "the companion in sax j1808.43658 is believed to be a @xmath41 brown dwarf ( bildsten & chakrabarty , 2001 ) .",
    "the roche lobe radii of the companion stars will therefore differ by almost an order of magnitude substantially reducing the x - ray radiation reprocessed by the companion in xte j0929314 .",
    "we have estimated the amplitude @xmath42 of optical modulation due to heating of the companion star in xte j0929314 using the relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the optical modulation observed for sax j1808.43658 ( giles et al , 1999 ) , @xmath45 is the ratio of the x - ray fluxes ( gilfanov et al . , 1998 , juett et al . , 2003 ) , @xmath46 is the ratio of distances between the neutron stars and their companions and @xmath47 is the ratio of the roche lobe radii for the two systems .",
    "the estimated orbital modulation is @xmath48 per cent of that observed suggesting that , if it is generated thermally , much of the emission comes from a hot spot on the disc .",
    "this provides an explanation for the observed maximum phase which lies mid - way between that expected from heating of the companion and from hot spot emission .    turning to the spectral characteristics the broadband spectra from sax j1808.43658",
    "are well fitted by smoothly varying functions derived from a thermal disc model ( wang et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "however , there are signifiant , time dependent , _ r _ & _ i _ band excesses in our xte j0929314 spectra .",
    "nothing like this has been reported for sax j1808.43658 although wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported a strong near ir _ jhk _ excess on one occasion and this may well have extended to optical wavelengths .",
    "we have insufficient information to explain our observed spectral variability . as noted in section 3.5",
    ", variable balmer emission may be responsible for the _ r _ band excesses but can not contribute to the excesses in _",
    "i_. the remarkable changes in the red excesses between hjd 396 and 399 and between hjd 409 and 414 might perhaps be due to diffusion inwards of cool matter from a brief enhancement of mass transfer onto the disc from the companion star .",
    "alternatively , the red excesses may be due to transient synchrotron emission from matter flowing out of the system via bipolar jets .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum is cut off at wavelengths shorter than _",
    "r_.    as noted in section 1 , many different classes of x - ray binaries emit synchrotron radiation ( fender 2003 ) .",
    "rupen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified a weak ( @xmath49 mjy ) 4.86 ghz radio source at the sax j0929 - 314 position on 2002 may 3 and 7 .",
    "unfortunately there do not appear to have been any ir observations during this outburst .",
    "we hypothesise that a rather similar phenomenon may have occurred during the 1998 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 .",
    "wang et al ( 2001 ) noted that the _ v _ & _ i _ band fluxes measured by the jkt 1-m telescope on 1998 april 18.2 were about 0.2 magnitudes brighter than they were @xmath0 0.5 days later when measured by the mt canopus 1-m telescope .",
    "they assumed that the discrepancy was due to calibration uncertainties in the jkt data .",
    "there was a clear ir ( _ jhk _ ) excess measured by the ukirt telescope at 1998 april 18.6 just 0.4 days after the jkt measurements .",
    "wang et al . ( 2001 ) proposed a synchrotron origin for this ir excess .",
    "we suggest that the synchrotron excess was also present at the time of the jkt measurements and that it extended into the optical bands .",
    "it had disappeared at the time of the mt canopus measurements a few hours later .",
    "the optical counterpart of xte j0929314 was variable on all timescales down to a few hours during the 2002 may observations .",
    "on one occasion lasting @xmath50 hours the _ i _ band flux was modulated at the orbital period with amplitude @xmath51 magnitudes .",
    "no variability was apparent in the x - ray measurements ( galloway et al , 2002b ) .",
    "the peak of the orbital modulation occurs at a phase of @xmath27 relative to the x - ray ephemeris and appears to rule out x - ray heating of the companion as the source of the modulation unless it is combined with emission from a hot spot on the disc .    broad band _",
    "bvri _ spectra taken on 8 nights have an approximately power law distribution as expected for an optically thick accretion disc but with variable excesses in _",
    "r _ & _ i_. overall these excesses declined and the spectra steepened ( became bluer ) during the period of the observations . while variable @xmath52 emission may be responsible for some of the excess in _",
    "r _ , another explanantion is required for the _ i _ band enhancements .",
    "we suggest they may be due to emission from cool matter in the outer part of the disc following a transient episode of mass transfer from the companion .",
    "alternatively , variable synchrotron emission , cut off at _ r _ band wavelengths , contributes to the emission spectrum .",
    "there is a clear need for fast follow - up optical , ir and radio observations of millisecond x - ray pulsars .",
    "these should include polarimetry and high time resolution optical and near ir photometry to test the synchrotron emission hypothesis .",
    "the feasibility of high speed photometry at the pulsar spin frequency might also be investigated .",

    "<S> the phase indicates that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hot spot on the disc and x - ray heating of the secondary . </S>",
    "<S> the emission generally trended bluer with _ b - i _ decreasing by 0.6 magnitudes during the observations but there were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical identification when the _ i _ band flux _ decreased _ </S>",

    "<S> we suggest that this may be due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system and note that similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous _ v _ & _ i _ band measurements in 1998 of the persistent millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 .    </S>",
