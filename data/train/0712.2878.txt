    "the kinematic dynamo has revealed many an essential workings of an astrophysical dynamo for the generation of magnetic field in objects varying from stars to molecular clouds to accretion disks .",
    "the kinematic dynamo ( parker 1955 ; steenbeck , krause and rdler 1966 ; moffatt 1970 ; stix 1972 ) is based on the possible generation of an electromotive force parallel to the mean magnetic field in a reflexionally asymmetric turbulence , the so called @xmath0 effect . here @xmath0 is a measure of the net kinetic helicity .",
    "the corresponding turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath1 becomes a function of the mean turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "the scale separation is an integral part of the kinematic dynamo .",
    "a weakly ionized plasma is defined by the condition ( alfvn and flthammer 1962 ) that the electron - neutral collision frequency @xmath2 is much larger than the electron - ion collision frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this translates into the ionization fraction @xmath4 ( alfvn and flthammer 1962 ) where @xmath5 s are the particle densities and @xmath6 is the temperature in kelvin .",
    "although the ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) is often used as a starting point of an astrophysical investigation , there are many systems with a rather low degree of ionization dominated by the charged particle - neutral collisions and the neutral particle dynamics . a major part of the solar photosphere ( leake & arber 2006 ; krishan & varghese 2007 ) , the protoplanetary disks ( krishan & yoshida 2006 ) and the molecular clouds ( brandenburg & zweibel 1994 ) are some of the examples of weakly ionized astrophysical plasmas",
    ". the dynamo action in such a plasma would be affected by the multifluid interactions .",
    "the issue of possible disconnection between the sub - surface and the surface solar magnetic field , recently emphasized by schssler ( 2005 ) , may have some bearing on the neglect of the neutral fluid - plasma coupling in the flux transport on the solar photosphere .",
    "zweibel ( 1988 ) studied the dynamo process in a partially ionized plasma within a single fluid description . including only the ambipolar diffusion ,",
    "she determined the velocity , the density and the magnetic field fluctuations self consistently in the form of magnetohydrodynamic waves and thus went beyond the kinematic dynamo .",
    "we develop a three fluid framework for a kinematic dynamo including the hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion in section two .",
    "the @xmath0 effect of the kinematic dynamo is formulated in section three .",
    "the new correlations arising due to the coupling amongst different fluids are understood by taking the alfvnic turbulence as an example and we end the paper with a section on discussion and conclusion .",
    "we begin with the three component partially ionized plasma consisting of electrons ( e ) , ions ( i ) of uniform mass density @xmath7 and neutral particles ( n ) of uniform mass density @xmath8 the equation of motion of the electrons can be written as : @xmath9=   -\\nabla p_{\\rm e}- \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad\\quad e n_{\\rm e}\\left[{\\b e}+   \\frac{\\b v_{\\rm e}\\times \\b b}{c}\\right]-   m_{\\rm e}n_{\\rm e}\\nu_{\\rm en}(\\b v_{\\rm e}-\\b v_{\\rm n})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the electron - ion collisions have been neglected since the ionized component is of low density . on neglecting the electron inertial force , the electric field @xmath10 is found to be : @xmath11 this gives us ohm s law . for @xmath12 the ion dynamics can be ignored .",
    "the ion force balance then becomes : @xmath13-\\nu_{\\rm in}\\rho_{\\rm i}(\\b v_{\\rm i}-\\b v_{\\rm n})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the ion - neutral collision frequency , and the ion ",
    "electron collisions have been neglected for the low density ionized component . substituting for @xmath10 from eq .",
    "( 2 ) we find the relative velocity between the ions and the neutrals : @xmath15 where @xmath16 the equation of motion of the neutral fluid is : @xmath17\\!\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\ ! -\\nabla p_{\\rm n}-\\nu_{\\rm ni}\\rho_{\\rm n}(\\b v_{\\rm n}-\\b v_{\\rm i})-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nu_{\\rm ne}\\rho_{\\rm n}(\\b v_{\\rm n}-\\b v_{\\rm e})~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the viscosity of the neutral fluid has been neglected . substituting for @xmath18 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and using @xmath19 we find : @xmath20=-\\nabla p+\\frac{{\\b j}\\times { \\b b}}{c}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "observe that the neutral fluid is subjected to the lorentz force as a result of the strong ion - neutral coupling due to their collisions .",
    "consider faraday s law of induction : @xmath22 by substituting for the electric field from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we get @xmath23 where the pressure gradient terms have been dropped for the incompressible case with constant temperature . here @xmath24 is the electrical resistivity predominantly due to electron - neutral collisions . using the construction @xmath25\\times\\b b~,\\ ] ] and substituting for the relative velocity of the ion and the neutral fluid from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , eq .",
    "( 9 ) becomes : @xmath26+\\eta{\\nabla}^{2}\\b b\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can easily identify the hall term ( @xmath27 ) , and the ambipolar diffusion term ( @xmath28 ) ( chitre & krishan 2001 ) .",
    "the hall term is much larger than the ambipolar term for large neutral particle densities or for @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ion cyclotron frequency . in this system",
    "the magnetic field is not frozen to any of the fluids .",
    "equations ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) along with the mass conservation @xmath31 form the basis of our investigation .",
    "the @xmath0 effect along with its several variants is the key concept in the generation of large scale magnetic fields from small scale velocity and magnetic fields in the kinematic dynamo process ( krause & rdler 1980 ) .",
    "the magnetic induction equation ( 11 ) is written as : @xmath32+\\eta{\\nabla}^{2}\\b b~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 with @xmath34 as the hall velocity and @xmath35 could be called the ambipolar velocity . following the standard procedure ( krause & rdler 1980 ) the velocity @xmath36 and the magnetic field @xmath37 are split into their average large scale parts and the fluctuating small scale parts as : @xmath38 such that @xmath39 in the kinematic dynamo the magnetic induction equation",
    "is solved for large and small scale fields .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) into the induction equation ( 11 ) , we find , in the first order smoothing approximation , @xmath40 and the mean flow is found to be : @xmath41    the turbulent electromotive force is defined as and is a function of the mean magnetic induction @xmath42 and mean quantities formed from the fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations in turbulence have , generally , a correlation in spatial scale @xmath43 and time scale @xmath44 . in a two - scale turbulence , @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the scales of the large scale quantities .",
    "thus the fluctuations need to be determined in the immediate vicinity of the point at which the large scale quantity is to be found .",
    "this enables us to employ taylor s expansion for @xmath42 and express the turbulent electromotive force as ( eq .",
    "5.4 of krause & rdler 1980 ) , retaining only the first order spatial derivatives and omitting all time derivatives , @xmath49 for a zero mean flow ( @xmath50 ) , homogeneous , isotropic , steady and non - mirror symmetric turbulent velocity field @xmath51 the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 become isotropic , and can be expressed as : @xmath54 and the electromotive force can be expressed as : @xmath55 the coefficients @xmath56 or @xmath0 and @xmath57 or @xmath1 become functions of @xmath58 for large @xmath58 as we find here from the contribution of the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 , a pseudoscalar , turns out to be the kinetic helicity of the turbulence and is defined as:@xmath59 here , retaining terms quadratic in fluctuations , @xmath60 is the measure of the average kinetic helicity of the neutral fluid in the turbulence possessing correlations over time @xmath61 and @xmath62 represents the contribution of the hall effect .",
    "the coupling of the charged components with the neutral fluid is clearly manifest through the possible correlation between the current density fluctuations and the vorticity fluctuations of the neutral fluid @xmath63 the ambipolar term gives rise to @xmath64 with @xmath65 as the contribution from the ambipolar diffusion with its essential nonlinear character manifest through its dependence on the average magnetic induction .",
    "one also observes that the hall alpha ( eq .  28 ) requires a component of the fluctuating current density along the fluctuating vorticity of the neutral fluid whereas the ambipolar effect ( eq .  29 ) thrives on the component of the fluctuating current density perpendicular to the fluctuating vorticity .",
    "the turbulent dissipation is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 as the measure of the average turbulent kinetic energy of the neutral fluid in the turbulence possessing correlations over time @xmath44 and @xmath68 represents the contribution of the hall effect .",
    "the coupling of the charged components with the neutral fluid is clearly manifest through the possible correlation between the current density fluctuations and the velocity fluctuations of the neutral fluid .",
    "the ambipolar term furnishes @xmath69 @xmath70 with its essential nonlinear character manifest through its dependence on the average magnetic induction .",
    "one also observes that the hall @xmath71 requires a component of the current density fluctuations along the velocity fluctuations of the neutral fluid whereas the ambipolar effect thrives on the component of the current density fluctuations perpendicular to the velocity fluctuations .",
    "we have used rigid or perfectly conducting boundary conditions ( all surface contributions vanish ) while determining the averages . here",
    "we consider what is known as the @xmath72 dynamo and take the mean flow @xmath73 .",
    "this actually determines the relative mean flow amongst the three fluids .",
    "the dynamo equation reduces to @xmath74 + \\eta{\\nabla}^{2}{\\b b}~.\\ ] ] from now onwards we omit the bar on the large scale magnetic field . assuming one dimensional space dependence , we assume the magnetic induction @xmath75 in cartesian coordinates @xmath76 . in the corresponding spherical configuration",
    ", one identifies the cartesian coordinates @xmath76 with the polar coordinates @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the toroidal and the poloidal parts of the field , respectively ( stix 1972 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions then turn out to be the vanishing of @xmath78 and @xmath80 at the endpoints of a finite @xmath81-interval , say @xmath82 and @xmath83 corresponding to the poles of the sphere .",
    "it is convenient to put the induction equation in a dimensionless form using a normalizing magnetic field @xmath84 a spatial scale @xmath85 a time scale @xmath86 and writing @xmath87",
    "it begets : @xmath88 +         \\nonumber \\\\ & & r_{\\beta\\rm a } { \\partial\\over \\partial x}\\left[\\left   ( b+b { \\partial a'\\over\\partial x}\\right){\\partial        b\\over\\partial x}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 here one observes that since the hall effect contributes linearly , it can be combined with the standard @xmath97 effect .",
    "the ambipolar effect is nonlinear and appears separately in the induction equation .",
    "the hall effect can completely quench or enhance the standard @xmath97 contribution to the dynamo for @xmath98 . in the absence of the ambipolar effect one",
    "recovers the standard @xmath72 effect with an exponential growth rate of the magnetic induction .",
    "it is instructive to examine the new correlations for the case of say alfvnic turbulence . now in the weakly ionized case the relation between the velocity and the magnetic field fluctuations for the alfvn waves is given by @xmath99 ( krishan & varghese 2007 ) with @xmath100 substituting these results in the expression for @xmath101 we find : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the ion inertial scale and @xmath104 is the ion plasma frequency and @xmath105 is the ratio of the average kinetic helicity and the average enstrophy of the neutral fluid turbulence .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ambipolar @xmath0 effect vanishes for the alfvnic turbulence . in the next section",
    "we discuss the results of the numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( 37 ) and ( 38 ) .",
    "we solve the field eqs .",
    "( 37 ) and ( 38 ) demonstrating the linear and the nonlinear @xmath0 effect for the initial conditions given by stix ( 1972 ) : @xmath106 @xmath107 in the absence of the ambipolar contribution ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "( 37 ) and ( 38 ) become linear with a solution of the form @xmath109,$ ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the dimensionless wavenumber .",
    "then the field grows for @xmath112 i.e. , for large values of the effective @xmath0 at large spatial scale .    with the inclusion of the ambipolar contributions equations",
    "become nonlinear . in fig .  1 , we present a case with the hall and the ambipolar contributions . the comparable values of the coefficients of the linear and the nonlinear @xmath0 terms with @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 lead to a near constant toroidal field near @xmath118 fast decaying solution at @xmath119 and growing solution at @xmath120 beyond @xmath121",
    ". the poloidal field , however , grows at all values of @xmath81 .",
    "the panels c and d demonstrate the expected formation of spatially sharp magnetic structures due to the nonlinearity of the ambipolar diffusion ( brandenburg & zweibel 1994 ) . the toroidal field in addition undergoes a reversal at @xmath122 .",
    "figure  2 shows the dominant effect of the ambipolar term with @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath116 and @xmath126 .",
    "both the components of the magnetic field , after an initial near steady state , grow rather fast and again the formation of small spatial scale structures is evident .",
    "thus the inclusion of the hall and the ambipolar effects opens up a range of possible profiles of the magnetic field .    in this first attempt ,",
    "a framework and some instructive examples of the dynamo solutions in a 3-component magnetofluid have been given . in subsequent work",
    "we plan to investigate the role of the hall and the ambipolar terms in some realistic situations such as the solar surface , molecular clouds and the accretion disks . in order to deal with these systems , the differential rotation in the objects",
    "must be included .",
    "in the three component system , one would have to specify the rotation profile of all the components since the system can afford to carry a net current density .",
    "the inclusion of the ion - neutral collisions introduces an additional time scale with which the turbulence correlation time needs to be contrasted .",
    "the inclusion of the hall effect brings in the physics at the ion - inertial spatial scale and ion gyration time scale .",
