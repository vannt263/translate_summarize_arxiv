    "exotic states of matter are among the most intriguing topics in the field of condensed matter physics .",
    "one class of these exotic states are the two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems in which quasi - particles follow non - abelian quantum statistics @xcite .",
    "the search for such systems is driven both by their unique properties and by their potential application to topological quantum computing @xcite .    in a non - abelian state",
    "the ground state is degenerate when quasi - particles are present , and the degeneracy increases exponentially with the number of quasi - particles .",
    "perhaps the simplest way of obtaining such a degeneracy is by having quasi - particles that carry majorana fermionic excitations @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) are expected to appear as zero - energy excitations in the cores of vortices in a layered superconductor  such as proposed for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite , in 2d systems that can be mapped onto such a superconductor  the @xmath2 fractional quantum hall state @xcite , on the surface of a topological insulator that is in proximity to an _",

    "furthermore , they are expected to form in 1d systems in proximity to @xmath3-wave superconductors @xcite , and in several other systems @xcite .",
    "a variety of experiments have been proposed in order to probe the predicted mfs , based on the their unique properties . to mention a few examples : zero - energy excitations can be observed by performing stm measurements at the vortex core @xcite ; the degeneracy of the ground state affects the thermodynamical properties @xcite ; non - locality of an electron in a majorana state has a signature in tunneling between two vortices @xcite ; and interferometric experiments are able to probe the non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "the suggested thermodynamics and interferometry measurements are based on the unique many - body properties of the mfs , but assume that the mfs are localized at theirs positions .",
    "the mfs appear at vortex cores , which are expected to rearrange as an abrikosov lattice at high enough density .",
    "the lattice order and the small tunneling amplitude between neighboring vortices remove the ground state degeneracy and form a band of low - energy excitations . on one hand , this band may serve to probe the existence of the mfs . on the other hand , it may conceal signals of suggested many - body measurements , especially controlled adiabatic processes , such as interferometry .    some previous works",
    "have analyzed clean periodic square , triangular @xcite and honeycomb @xcite lattices of mfs , and found the electronic conductivity associated with tunneling between vortex cores .",
    "other works have considered some aspects of random square @xcite and honeycomb @xcite lattices . in this paper , we consider disordered triangular lattices .",
    "this lattice breaks time - reversal symmetry : it may be mapped onto a tight - binding model of electrons on the same lattice with each plaquette being pierced by @xmath4 magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the sign of the flux is determined by the sign of the tight - binding coupling term .",
    "the spectrum of the perfect lattice is gapped .",
    "our main finding is that disorder in the _ sign _ of the tunneling amplitude between neighboring sites creates a peak in the density of states ( dos ) at zero energy .",
    "we show that at weak disorder zero - energy localized sub - gap states are created , and coupling between these states creates a dos close to zero energy . at strong disorder",
    "the sign flipping creates domain walls between regions of the two time - reversed phases , and chiral modes appear along these walls .",
    "when the signs are random , we find the domains to be narrow and the spectrum of excitations to be characterized by strong dependence on the geometry of the walls . plausibly , that is the source of the zero - energy dos peak in the highly disordered system .",
    "the transition between these two limits is a percolation phase transition , taking place when the probability of flipping a sign is around 0.15 .",
    "we find the dos to diverge at zero energy at intermediate and strong disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : disorder ] , we define the mfs lattice model , and show the numerical dos for a disordered lattice . in section [ sec : edge ] , we examine how low - energy excitations may emerge from localized modes in the limit of weak disorder and from extended interfaces in the limit of large @xmath5 .",
    "section [ sec : percolation ] discusses the dependence of the excitation spectrum on the strength of the disorder .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results and compares them to previous works .",
    "our interest here is in mfs that form a triangular lattice .",
    "an mf is defined as a self - adjoint operator @xmath6 that satisfies fermionic anti - commutation relation @xmath7 .",
    "a standard complex fermionic operator can be constructed from mfs by superposing an even number of them .",
    "for example @xmath8 for two mfs satisfies the standard anti - commutation relations @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we consider mfs that are solutions of the bogoliubov de - gennes ( bdg ) equation in the presence of vortices in the superconductor .",
    "each vortex in the superconductor carries a signle mf , whose wavefunction is exponentially localized around the vortex s core",
    ". overlaps of the mf wavefunctions of neighboring vortices result in tunneling matrix elements .",
    "vortices in superconductors and quasi - particles in clean quantum hall systems are arranged on a lattice ; thus the mfs are also arranged as a lattice , and their dynamics may naturally be described by the tight - binding model .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry of the bdg equation implies that a single mf is a zero - energy solution .",
    "hence , in the tight - binding hamiltonian the on - site energy of the mfs is zero , and there are only hopping terms @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , for the hamiltonian to be hermitian , @xmath12 , implying a purely imaginary hopping term . by assuming discrete symmetry of the lattice to translations ,",
    "we can write the simple hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 are nearest neighbors and @xmath15 .    any element @xmath16 is gauge dependent , because the @xmath17 operators are defined up to an overall sign .",
    "however , the product of @xmath16 s along a path creating a closed loop is gauge independent",
    ". it has been shown in @xcite that for any lattice whose plaquette is a polygon of @xmath18 vertices , the product of @xmath16 around each plaquette corresponds to the plaquette enclosing @xmath19 flux quanta .",
    "therefore the product of the hopping terms along the bonds that create the plaquette is @xmath20 , and the product of the @xmath16 s along this path is @xmath21 ( the direction of the path is chosen to be aligned with the chirality of the order parameter ) .",
    "( a ) one possible gauge of the tight - binding model of mfs on a triangular lattice , which is expressed in equation ( [ eq : hclean ] ) .",
    "an arrow from site @xmath22 to site @xmath23 means @xmath24 .",
    "note that the lattice is split into two sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and that the counterclockwise product of the @xmath16 s around each triangle equals to @xmath21 .",
    "( b ) the corresponding gapped spectrum , with @xmath27.,width=453 ]    in particular , in the triangular lattice each plaquette encloses a quarter of flux quantum , and the product of the hopping terms equals @xmath28 , revealing a time - reversal anti - symmetry .",
    "moreover , the unit cell which encloses a flux quantum is a parallelogram of four neighboring triangles , leading to the lattice being composed of two sublattices .",
    "one possible gauge is illustrated in figure [ fig : triangular](a ) , which also depicts the two sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this gauge @xmath29",
    "let us assume a clean periodic lattice of @xmath30 sites , with @xmath31 even .",
    "we can define the fourier transform @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "these transformed operators are complex fermions , which satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 they are mfs . by denoting spinor @xmath42 the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath43 where the pauli matrices act on the sublattice space .",
    "the resulting spectrum has an energy gap of @xmath44 , where @xmath27 , as depicted in figure [ fig : triangular](b ) .",
    "the hopping elements between neighboring mfs are very sensitive to the inter - vortex separation .",
    "for example it was shown that for a superconductor @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fermi momentum , @xmath47 is the inter - vortex distance , and @xmath48 is the coherence length , which is usually larger than @xmath46",
    ". the exponential decay and the oscillations were found to occur also for the @xmath49 case @xcite , and are likely to appear in all realizations .",
    "therefore small deformations of the abrikosov lattice of order @xmath50 will produce fluctuations in both the amplitude and sign of the hopping terms @xmath11 .",

    "the dos of these two cases , which are also depicted in figure [ fig : dosall ] , clearly shows that the zero - energy peak in the dos appears only due to random signs , while random amplitudes merely smear the spectrum without closing the energy gap .",
    "we are mostly interested in the zero - energy peak of the dos , and therefore in the following we will focus on the case where disorder appears in the sign of the hopping terms .",
    "the sharp peak that we found numerically for the density of states of finite systems close to zero - energy naturally raises the question of the way the dos scales with the size of the system in the thermodynamic limit . increasing the system size @xmath58 obviously increases the dos .",
    "if the lowest energies decay faster than @xmath59 , then the zero - energy dos will increase faster than @xmath60 , and the zero - energy dos per unit area would diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the dos is of a @xmath74 lattice , and was averaged over 1000 realizations . , width=491 ]    it is instructive to compare the dos we find for the case of random nearest - neighbor hopping to that we find for the case of a random hermitian matrix of imaginary terms .",
    "the dos of the latter is a version of a semicircle distribution , with a delta peak at zero energy , due to the symmetry of the spectrum with respect to reflection about zero energy @xcite .",
    "when we add second nearest - neighbor hopping with random signs to the hamiltonian , the dos indeed gets closer to the semicircle .",
    "figure [ fig : enl](b ) shows the spectrum for several ratios of @xmath72 , the amplitude of the next - nearest - neighbor terms , to @xmath71 .",
    "we note , however , that we numerically find the gap to close even for the clean system when @xmath75 .     the disorder - averaged dos @xmath70 of a periodic @xmath76 lattice as a function of the probability @xmath5 for flipping the sign of a hopping term . for @xmath77",
    "the dos is that of figure [ fig : dosall](a ) .",

    ", width=245 ]    having established that the dos of the clean lattice is characterized by an energy gap limited by two singular peaks , and the lattice where the sign of the hopping terms is random is characterized by a zero energy peak above a gapless background , we examine the evolution of the dos with @xmath5 , the probability of flipping the sign of a hopping term , which increases from 0 ( the clean lattice ) to 0.5 ( the random sign limit ) . figure [ fig : dos_vs_p_t2](a ) shows how increasing @xmath5 makes the singular peaks of the clean system spread , and gradually creates sub - gap states .    in the next section we study the way the gap is closed , and especially the appearance of the zero - energy peak .",
    "we address these questions by an examination of two limits . in the weak disorder limit ,",

    "these two cases are characterized by two opposite chern numbers : by writing the @xmath81 component of equation ( [ eq : hk1k2 ] ) as @xmath82 , it is easy to see that the majorana band is characterized by a non - trivial chern number @xmath83^{3/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sign(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the disorder - induced reversal of signs of hopping terms may revert the sign of the flux in some of the plaquettes in the lattice .",
    "the systems would then have islands of one phase separated by lines of interface from the bulk of the other phase .",
    "an infinite interface between two phases of different chern numbers is accompanied by gapless modes @xcite . for finite islands ,",
    "one may naively expect finite - size quantization to induce a gap in the energy spectrum , and thus low - energy excitations to require large islands .",
    "this expectation is only partially valid .",
    "as we explain below , for the majorana lattice , large islands are associated with low - energy excitations at their edges , but small islands may carry low - energy and zero - energy modes as well .",
    "when the probability @xmath5 of flipping the sign of a hopping term is very small the flipped terms are dilute , and most of them are isolated . a two - triangles island , which is created by flipping the sign of a single hopping term , results in two localized sub - gap states with energies of approximately @xmath84 .",
    "theses states are the source of the peaks in the dos at @xmath85 , and indeed in the limit of small probability the dos associated with these peaks @xmath86 .",
    "such islands do not , however , contribute to the dos close to zero energy .    as we show in [ app : mininal ] , flipping three hopping terms with a common vertex creates two localized states with energy that is either zero or exponentially small with the system size .",
    "we also show that this is the minimal way of creating zero modes .",
    "thus , for small @xmath5 the zero - energy dos is dominated by the probability of creating such configurations , and should scale like @xmath87 .",
    "the two modes are , however , split when there is a single flipped hopping term at a distance @xmath47 from that vertex .",
    "the exact splitting depends on the orientations of the bonds with flipped signs , but we found numerically that it can be well approximated by @xmath88 . for @xmath89 to be much smaller than the typical finite - size energy splitting , that scales as @xmath90 , we need @xmath91",
    ". a given radius @xmath47 encloses approximately @xmath92 hopping terms around the vertex , and the probability that all these terms are unflipped is @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the @xmath87 dependence of the zero - energy dos is limited to small values of @xmath94 .",
    "for example , for a @xmath76 lattice we get @xmath95 .    as @xmath5 gets large , the plaquettes in which the flux is reversed connect to one another , and the system is split into domains with opposite fluxes .",
    "to understand the excitations spectrum in this limit , we first examine the spectrum of excitations associated with the various possible interfaces of two large domains of opposite fluxes .",
