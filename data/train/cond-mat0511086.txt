    "rather a wide compositional interval of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are coupled ( fig .",

    "@xcite slightly smaller difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath191  k , is obtained when using compositional dependence of the martensitic curie temperature estimated from the data for @xmath192 .",
    "this can be caused by the fact that for the @xmath192 compositions the effect of disordering on @xmath5 was not taken into consideration .    in a critical composition @xmath180 , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "are no longer coupled , which results in a drastic increase of the martensitic transformation temperature above 500  k. with further increase in the ni excess , @xmath7 rapidly grows and in ni@xmath193mn@xmath194ga @xmath195 the martensitic transformation occurs at temperatures above 600  k. as evident from our phase diagram ( fig .  3 ) and from the data summarized for a large number of ni - mn - ga compositions ,  @xcite compositional dependence of @xmath7 differs in the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic states .",
    "this fact can be related to the difference in the electronic structure of these phases .",
    "indeed , first principle calculations  @xcite have revealed sharp distinctions between density of states of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
    "specifically , in the ferromagnetic state the fermi energy passes through a peak of ni @xmath196-states , whereas fermi level of the paramagnetic state is located at a high peak of mn @xmath196-states .",
    "although calculations of the electronic structure of paramagnetic tetragonal phase  @xcite did not support scenario of a band jahn - teller effect as a driving force for the martensitic phase transition , it is necessary to stress that the martensitic transition takes place in paramagnetic state only in the alloys with a large deviation from stoichiometry , whereas the first principle calculations were performed for stoichiometric ni@xmath11mnga composition .    as compared to the theoretical analysis of phase transitions presented in ref .  , the theoretical approach adopted in this work differs in several aspects .",
    "it is well known that anisotropic magnetostriction tends to zero in the vicinity of curie point @xmath8 ; it is also rather small even below @xmath8 as compared to the volume magnetostriction at temperatures near @xmath8 .",
    "fradkin showed  @xcite that the volume magnetostriction has an influence on magnetostructural phase transition only if one considers a term connecting order parameter @xmath91 , responsible for a volume change at phase transition , with order parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 , responsible for symmetry changes at phase transitions . although volume magnetostriction was considered in ref .   in the landau functional , the term connecting @xmath91 and @xmath197 ,",
    "@xmath198 order parameters was not taken into account .",
    "because of this , the role of the volume magnetostriction came to a renormalization of the exchange constant @xmath118 and , thus , the interaction between magnetic and structural subsystems was accounted for by the anisotropic magnetostriction only . as a consequence ,",
    "the theoretical phase diagram  @xcite did not account accurately the width of the composition interval with coupled magnetostructural phase transition",
    ". other relevant difference between theoretical analysis of the present work and that given in ref .",
    "concerns areas of stability of the phases .",
    "conditions for the phase equilibrium are different due to the fact that in ref .",
    "the first cubic anisotropy constant @xmath87 was assumed to be negative ( @xmath199 ) , whereas subsequent experimental results  @xcite showed that in fact it is positive ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "present theoretical study , which assumes a linear decrease of curie temperature due to the dilution of the magnetic subsystem and a linear increase of martensitic transition due to the increase in electron concentration , showed fair agreement with the experiment for the regions of the phase diagram where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are decoupled . as for the region characterized by the coupled magnetostructural phase transition",
    ", the applicability of the theory is limited due to the following reasons .",
    "although consideration of the volume magnetostriction is shown to be useful for describing the width of composition interval of magnetostructural phase transition , just the volume magnetostriction is responsible for the deviation from a linear increase of the magnetostructural transition temperature in @xmath200 .",
    "it had been suggested in the above discussion that despite increasing number of valence electrons @xmath7 does not increase due to the influence of volume magnetostriction .",
    "magnetic transition , it its turn , will remain coupled to the structural transition until @xmath7 temperature will not exceed the curie temperature of martensite @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the behavior of magnetostructural transition temperature in @xmath178 can be understood as a delicate balance between the change of brillouine zone boundary caused by the volume magnetostriction and an increase in valence electron concentration occurring upon substitution of ni for mn , i.e. , by the microscopic arguments which can not be accounted in the phenomenological approach .",
    "strictly speaking , the agreement between theoretical and experimental phase diagram in the interval of compositions @xmath61 is essentially due to the fact that exchange interactions are stronger in the martensitic phase than in the austenitic phase , which leads to the increase of magnetostructural transition temperature up to @xmath44 .",
    "in the opposite case of @xmath201 ( experimentally observed in a ni - mn - sn system  @xcite ) no increase in the magnetostructural transition temperature should be observed .",
    "we investigated , experimentally and theoretically , phase diagram of ferromagnetic shape memory alloys ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga in the range of @xmath23 up to 0.36 .",
    "peculiar feature of the phase diagram was found in a compositional interval @xmath56 .",
    "for these alloys , martensitic and ferromagnetic transitions are merged in a coupled magnetostructural phase transition from ferromagnetic austenite to paramagnetic martensite . due to the difference in curie temperatures of austenite and martensite",
    ", the temperature of this phase transition has a non - monotonous dependence on ni excess @xmath23 , whereas magnetic moment per formula unit exhibits an ordinary decrease with the dilution of the mn magnetic subsystem .",
    "the extended compositional interval of merged @xmath7 and @xmath8 is suggested to be due to the influence of volume magnetostriction .",
    "the difference in curie temperatures of martensitic and austenitic phases estimated from the experimental phase diagram is @xmath202  k , which is in good agreement with the value obtained from the comparison of reduced magnetization of austenitic and martensitic phases .",
    "@xcite    in the alloys with @xmath60 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are no longer coupled , and the martensitic transformation takes place at temperatures above 500  k. since such materials are important for high - temperature shape memory alloys , it can be suggested that in the @xmath203 alloys further increase in the martensitic transformation temperature can be attained by the substitution of ga for ni or for mn .",
