    "<S> under the hypothesis of a dark matter composed by supersymmetric particles like neutralinos , we investigate the possibility that their annihilation in the halos of nearby galaxies could produce detectable fluxes of @xmath0-photons . </S>",
    "<S> expected fluxes depend on several , poorly known quantities such as the density profiles of dark matter halos , the existence and prominence of central density cusps and the presence of a population of sub - halos . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for all reasonable choices of dark matter halo models , the intensity of the @xmath0-ray flux from some of the nearest extragalactic objects , like m31 , is comparable or higher than the diffuse galactic foreground . we show that next generation ground - based experiments could have the sensitivity to reveal such fluxes which could help us unveiling the nature of dark matter particles . </S>"
