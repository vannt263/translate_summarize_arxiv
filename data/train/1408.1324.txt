    "it is well - known that the shape of the euclidean unit ball @xmath13 has spectacular geometric properties with respect to other shapes . for instance , the sphere has the smallest surface area among all surfaces enclosing a given volume and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area ; hilbert and cohn - vossen @xcite even describe eleven geometric properties of the sphere !    but @xmath14 has also another spectacular ( non - geometric ) property related to its algebraic representation which is obvious even to people with a little background in mathematics : namely , its defining polynomial @xmath15 can not be simpler ! ! indeed , among all nonnegative quadratic homogeneous polynomials @xmath16 that define a bounded ball @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the one that minimizes the  cardinality norm \" @xmath19 ( which actually is not a norm ) .",

    "the fact that the @xmath36-unit ball is not an optimal solution of @xmath86 is not a surprise as the sparsity - induced norm @xmath84 ( when @xmath80 ) aims at find a polynomial @xmath318 which can be written as a sum of squares with as few terms as possible in the sum . on the other hand , the sparsity - induced norm @xmath37 aims at finding a polynomials @xmath47 with as few monomials as possible when @xmath24 is expanded in the monomial basis .",
    "these can be two conflicting criteria !",
    "in this section @xmath0 is now a ( positive ) rational with @xmath36-unit ball @xmath354 . even though the function @xmath355 is a  generalized polynomial \" and not a polynomial any more , it is still a nonnegative positively homogeneous of degree @xmath0 for which theorem [ th1](a ) applies . on the other hand ,",

    "define the space @xmath362 as : @xmath363 where only _ finitely many _",

    "for instance with @xmath281 and @xmath376 one has @xmath377 and with @xmath378 , @xmath379 and @xmath380 can be written as @xmath381 for some vector @xmath382 .",
    "obviously @xmath383 is a vector space of dimension @xmath372 and every function in @xmath383 is positively homogeneous of degree @xmath0 . as we did in ",

    "it follows that @xmath134 is positively homogeneous of degree @xmath135 .",
    "therefore ( [ vol - exp])-([relation-2 ] ) in theorem [ th1 ] holds for @xmath134 .",
    "finally , let @xmath386 and consider the finite - dimensional optimization problem @xmath387 when @xmath388 the unit ball @xmath29 is not convex and is not associated with a norm as can be seen in figure [ fig - undemi ] where @xmath389 .",
    "however , we have the following analogue of theorem [ th2-ell1 ]    [ th3-ell1-q ] let @xmath378 and @xmath390 .",

    "but the crucial fact that we exploit is that @xmath134 is strictly convex and theorem [ th1 ] holds for @xmath134 . as in the proof of theorem [ th2-ell1 ] , to show that @xmath31 in ( [ general - gstar ] ) satisfies the kkt - optimality conditions we only need prove that @xmath397 define the hankel - type moment matrix @xmath398 to be the real symmetric matrix with rows and columns indexed by @xmath399 and with entries @xmath400 equivalently , letting @xmath401 and re - indexing rows and columns of @xmath398 with @xmath402 , @xmath403 define @xmath404 , @xmath405 , and @xmath406 . observe that from ( [ help ] ) one may write @xmath407 let @xmath408 be the linear mapping defined by @xmath409 by an adaptation of lemma 4.3 in lasserre and netzer @xcite to the present homogeneous context one has @xmath410 indeed in lemma 4.3 of @xcite one only uses the hankel structure of the moment matrix @xmath398 and its positive definiteness .",
    "therefore for every @xmath395 , @xmath411 and so as in the proof of theorem [ th2-ell1 ] , @xmath31 satisfies the kkt - optimality conditions .",
    "we obtain the following even more general extension of theorem [ th2-ell1 ] .",
    "[ cor2 ] for every @xmath361 the generalized polynomial @xmath412 is the unique optimal solution of @xmath413 and ( [ relationship - q ] ) holds .",

    "then @xmath424 and @xmath380 . therefore by theorem [ th3-ell1-q ] , @xmath425 where @xmath426 , in contradiction with our assumption @xmath416 .",
    "then again the parsimony property of the @xmath36-unit ball @xmath29 can be retrieved by minimizing the @xmath2-norm over all nonnegative generalized polynomials @xmath414 whose associated ball unit ball @xmath5 has finite volume .",
    "+ next , concerning the @xmath3-norm , with @xmath378 an analogue of problem ( [ problem - p-11 ] ) now reads : @xmath427 and we have the following analogue of theorem [ th2 ] :    [ th2-q ] with @xmath378 and @xmath369 , problem @xmath428 in ( [ problem - p-11-q ] ) has a unique optimal solution @xmath429 whose vector of coefficients @xmath430 satisfies : @xmath431 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "we omit the proof as it is again a verbatim copy of that of theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "but in contrast to the case of polynomials in theorem [ th2 ] , in the optimal solution @xmath31 of @xmath428 , all coefficients @xmath432 , @xmath433 , are non - zero ! this follows from ( [ th2 - 1-q ] ) and the fact that all generalized moments @xmath434 , @xmath433 are non - zero ! for instance with @xmath389 and @xmath435 , @xmath436 @xmath437 hence the unique optimal solution @xmath31 of @xmath428 is not sparse at all . even more , with fixed @xmath361 , the larger is @xmath438 the more complicated is @xmath31 !",
