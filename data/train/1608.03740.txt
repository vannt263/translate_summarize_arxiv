    "the search for explicit formulae for subresultants in the roots of @xmath21 and @xmath22 when they have multiple roots is an active area of research ( see for instance @xcite ) , but very little seems to be known so far .",

    "it is worth noticing , however , that determinantal formulations for subresultants readily generalize to the case of root multiplicities ( see ( * ? ? ?",
