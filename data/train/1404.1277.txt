    "micro- and nano - fluidic separation stages are crucial components of micro total analysis systems ( @xmath0tas ) and other integrated systems in lab - on - a - chip platforms.@xcite in fact , many applications are ultimately a separation per se , such as in diagnostic systems where the goal is to detect / isolate a target of interest . in other applications , a separation stage is necessary to enrich a particular species present in a multicomponent sample for downstream processing .",
    "several strategies have been developed to separate particles , biological and otherwise .",
    "depending on the operation mode , these strategies have been broadly classified as batch or continuous methods and , depending on the use of external fields to drive separation , they are considered passive or active techniques .",
    "continuous methods , are generally less labor intensive and provide higher throughputs.@xcite passive methods , including pinch flow fractionation,@xcite hydrodynamic filtration,@xcite inertial focusing,@xcite and deterministic lateral displacement,@xcite are easier to operate and more portable than active methods which usually require bulky external components . in one approach to passive separation , geometrical features are fabricated into the device to create flow fields that drive different particles in distinctive trajectories .",
    "separation systems based on ridged surfaces , for example , rely on the recirculation flow that ensues in the main channel , when the ridges are not perpendicular to the channel . in general , big and small particles",
    "are carried by oppositely bound streams of the recirculation flow and can be separated.@xcite in these systems , the magnitude of the recirculating velocity is enhanced by using devices in which the depth of the grooves is comparable to the dimensions of the channel.@xcite . passive methods , however , are usually less versatile than active ones , which can use specific fields to fractionate a mixture based on the differentiating properties of the different species , e.g. , electric charge and impedance ( electrophoresis@xcite and dielectrophoresis  @xcite ) , refractive index ( optical sorting  @xcite ) , compressibility ( acoustophoresis  @xcite ) , and magnetic susceptibility ( magnetophoresis  @xcite ) . among both passive and active strategies , continuous two - dimensional techniques , also termed vector separation or vector chromatography ( vc ) , are particularly promising . in vc ,",
    "the different species in a sample fan out in different directions , and thus separate laterally , allowing their continuous collection with high resolution.@xcite here , we present a microfluidic device that takes advantage of the characteristics of the flow field in the vicinity and inside slanted open cavities patterned at the bottom surface of straight channels .",
    "we suppress the recirculation that ensues in confining geometries using devices with dimensions much larger than the dimensions of the ridges and the cavities that they create , and exploit the reorientation of the flow inside the open the cavities to passively and continuously fractionate , via vector chromatography , suspended particles . in this system ,",
    "separation can occur based on particle size , but also based on the settling velocity of the different particles , which represents an extra degree in versatility with respect to previous separation devices in which vc is based on a single property .",
    "note that the settling velocity of a particle depends on its shape , size , and buoyant density .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to use alternative ( additional ) force fields to play ( enhance ) the role of gravity in the present device , including electric , dielectrophoretic , and magnetic , which opens the door to a broad range of applications .",
    "we shall show that two regimes can be distinguished depending on the ratio between the settling velocity of the particles and their average velocity in the direction across the cavities .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the ratio between the characteristic time for a particle to settle inside the cavities and their average time to cross them . at low flow rates , when the particles have time to sediment as they are advected by the fluid flow across the cavities , heavier ones settle deeper and are deflected for a longer time than lighter particles . on the other hand , if sedimentation is negligible , particles can be separated based on their size , with smaller particles carried deeper into the cavities by the flow field and therefore deflecting more than larger particles . in the first part of this work , we gain insight into the separation mechanism by numerically solving the particle - free flow",

    "this is probably due to the larger drag force that the fluid exerts on the larger particles .",
    "similarly to the case of the 10.11 @xmath0 m ps particles in the device with large ridges , a few of the small silica particles can become trapped in the recirculating region at the corners of the cavities even at largest flow rate , and are thus not considered in the analysis .",

    "note , however , that the comparison with particle experiments is not quantitative , as expected based on the substantial difference in density between rbcs and silica particles .",
    "rbcs deflect more than wbcs , and exhibit complete confinement inside the cavities at low flow rates .",
    "however , unlike the motion of silica particles observed in the present device , rbcs can go over the ridges and move over the patterned surface as the flow rate increases ( see esi movie 6 ) . again , this is consistent with our previous results given that rbcs are lighter than silica particles .",
    "two subpopulations of wbcs could be clearly distinguished in the experiments ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "larger wbcs deflect to a lesser extent than smaller ones . as in the case of the ps particles ,",
    "the deflection angle of wbcs does not change considerably over the range of velocities considered , which indicates that sedimentation does not significantly affect their motion . as mentioned before ( see section [ subsec : methods ] ) , platelets remain suspended across the height of the channel and we can take advantage of their small size and light buoyant weight to consider them as tracer particles to probe the flow . their motion is entirely consistent with the characteristics of the particle free flow .",
    "specifically , platelets exhibited a broad range of deflection angles depending on their vertical position , with those moving far from the bottom surface not deflecting at all , and those moving close to the patterned surface showing the largest deflection angles ( for simplicity , their deflection angle was not included in fig .",
    "[ fig : blood.pdf ] ) .",
    "in fact , platelets were collected with 100% purity in the outlet channel aligned with the injection channel , indicating that some of the platelets in the flow focused stream did not deflect at all .",
    "these observations also confirm that the effect of the patterned surface on the flow is localized to its vicinity and that the recirculation observed in confined geometries is negligible here .",
    "we presented a microfluidic platform that allows the high - troughput , high - purity fractionation of suspensions based on the size and sedimentation velocity of the different components .",
    "interestingly , the interplay between the sometimes competing effects of size and sedimentation velocity results in a highly versatile separation method .",
    "the separation mechanism relies on the flow characteristics in the vicinity of slanted open cavities .",
    "the direction of the flow over the ridges creating the cavities does not deviate significantly from the imposed driving field . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a significant change in flow direction in the vicinity and inside the open cavities , which essentially guide the flow along them . as a result ,",
    "the deflection exhibited by different particles depends on the extent to which they penetrate into the open cavities .",
    "when sedimentation is negligible ( light particles and high flow rates ) smaller particles are advected by the fluid deeper into the open cavities , and therefore deflect more than bigger particles .",
    "we note that , in principle , remarkably high throughputs ( with particle velocities of the order of 1 cm / s ) could be achieved before inertial effects that might interfere with the underlying separation mechanism become important.@xcite in the opposite limit ( heavy particles and low flow rates ) , sedimentation becomes important and heavier particles deflect more . in this regime , however , the maximum flow rate is limited by the settling velocity of the particles , which reduces the overall throughput of the system .",
    "other fields , however , e.g. electric , dielectrophoretic , and magnetic , can be easily integrated with the device to play or enhance the role of gravity , which suggests that this technique could be readily adapted for a broad range of applications",

    ", this platform could be used as a microfluidic _ centrifuge _ because it allows the mild and non - destructive depletion and recovery of rbcs from the rest of the blood components .",
    "furthermore , plasma proteins , bacterium , platelets , different subpopulations of wbcs , and other rare blood cells would migrate at different angles and can be continuously fractionated .",
    "more generally , this platform could be a non - clogging and contamination - free alternative for laboratories that frequently use filtration to separate cells of different size ( from digested tissue , for example ) .",
    "droplets of different size and density can also be separated , and this platform might also benefit droplet microfluidic applications.@xcite the separation of cells , proteins , rna and dna , for example , can also be performed using centrifugal , electric and dielectrophoretic forces perpendicular to the patterned substrate to tune their settling velocity into the cavities and thus their deflection angle . in particular , patterning interdigitated electrodes between the ridges would be a simple way to integrate dielectrophoretic forces into the device .",
    "target cells and biomolecules can be tagged with particles via specific marker - antibody interactions , and the properties of the tagging particles can be tailored to tune the settling velocity of the tagged species .",
    "differences in settling velocity can also be used to control the time of arrival of different species to an array of open cavities . in this case ,",
    "particles of the same or different size but with different settling velocity would eventually separate laterally after reaching the patterned surface at different times , even if sedimentation does not play a role in their migration angle . in summary , this is a promising microfluidic separation platform that could benefit a wide range of applications .",
