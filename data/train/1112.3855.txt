    "in many physical systems , the relevant degrees of freedom are discrete degenerate quantum variables such as spins ( electron or nuclear ) that interact weakly with each other . at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the spins are completely disordered and characterized by the trivial thermodynamic correlators",
    ". however , their dynamical properties remain interesting and important for various applications .",
    "the spins generally fluctuate at frequencies of the order of the typical interaction @xmath3 . for some purposes ,",
    "though , one needs to know the asymptotics of the spin correlation function at much higher frequencies . in this regime ,",
    "the fluctuations and dynamical response are due to the simultaneous excitation of many degrees of freedom and inherent nonlinearity of the system .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a formalism for the computation of the high - frequency spin correlator and to apply the result to the problem of magnetic ( flux and inductance ) noise at mk temperatures produced by paramagnetic spins located at the surface of superconductor .",
    "specifically , we consider a set of spins described by the heisenberg hamiltonian with random couplings at high temperatures , @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the spin correlator decays exponentially with frequency at @xmath5 , i.e.  @xmath6 , and compute the coefficient @xmath7 in this formula .",
    "the smallness of the high frequency fluctuations has an important consequence when the interaction , although of the order of @xmath3 for the typical pairs of spins , is much larger for a small but significant number of pairs .",
    "this happens , for instance , if the spins are positioned randomly while the interaction between them falls off fast with distance .",
    "each strongly coupled pair",
    "has two states , the singlet and the triplet . transitions between those states require the exchange of a large energy quantum , @xmath8 between the pair and the surrounding spins .",
    "the transition rate is proportional to the dynamical spin correlator at frequency @xmath9 , which is exponentially small . as a result ,",
    "the switching events are rare and produce noise with , as we show below , @xmath2 spectrum at very _",
    "low frequencies_. at intermediate frequencies , the @xmath2 noise is due to spin diffusion  @xcite .",
    "our arguments rely on two important assumptions .",
    "first , the condition on the temperature is stricter than in the high frequency case : we need that @xmath10 if the noise is measured at frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the right - hand side of this inequality represents the transition energy @xmath9 of the relevant two - level systems ; if it is too large , such systems are frozen .",
    "we also assume that there is no efficient energy exchange mechanism between the two - level systems and an external thermal bath , e.g.  electrons or phonons .",
    "one application of our theory is the property of paramagnetic spins on the surface of superconducting aluminum .",
    "these spins , presumably located in the thin al@xmath12o@xmath13 film or just at the metal - insulator interface , are believed to be responsible for the low frequency flux noise that limits the sensitivity of dc squids  @xcite and causes decoherence in superconducting flux qubits  @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that the coupling between the spins is due to rkky interaction  @xcite , so their dynamics is controlled by the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "a number of experiments  @xcite shows that the @xmath2 noise at very low frequencies is temperature - independent fot @xmath14  mk .",
    "we take these data as evidence that the inter - spin interaction @xmath3 is so small that the spins remain in the high temperature regime in the whole experimental range .",
    "finally , in the superconductor all electronic excitations are gapped , and direct interaction between the spins and phonons at low temperature is negligible .",
    "all these facts combined together indicate that the spins in the oxide layer on the surface of aluminium or similar superconductors are described by the model studied in this paper .    a lower bound on @xmath3 can be inferred from the recent measurements of the flux qubit relaxation rate  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the relaxation is mainly due to the interaction with the surface spin , then @xmath15 , where @xmath9 is the energy difference between the two qubit states .",
    "the experimental data indicate the persistence of magnetic relaxation at very high frequencies , at least up to @xmath16  ghz . we conclude that the typical interaction between the surface spins",
    "is @xmath17 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed spin freezing at @xmath18 in some samples  @xcite as well as a theoretical estimate of the rkky interaction , see section  [ sect : low_frequency ] .",
    "the theory developed in this paper has many other applications , besides the problem of magnetic noise in superconducting circuits .",
    "it can be applied to many problems in which the relaxation of high energy modes is possible only by the simultaneous creation of a very large number of low energy excitations .",
    "some examples are the relaxation of inverted nuclear spin polarization in high magnetic fields and a similar problem of magnetization relaxation of cold atoms following a rapid quench  @xcite or @xmath2 magnetic noise observed in a low temperature calorimeter with superconducting particle absorbers  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first study high frequency spin fluctuations at infinite temperature ; then we show how the high frequency noise generates low frequency noise in a model with a broad distribution of coupling parameters .",
    "we finally discuss the application of this model to the problem of flux noise in superconducting qubits .",
    "we consider a set of spins of magnitude @xmath19 described by the heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath20 with random couplings @xmath21 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the @xmath22 case because it is most relevant for the physical applications .",
    "let us fix @xmath23 and consider the normalized correlation function for the spin @xmath24 ( with components @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) in the time and frequency domains : @xmath27 note that @xmath28 is real and positive .",
    "this follows from its physical interpretation as the quantum transition probability under a small perturbation @xmath29 ( more abstractly , @xmath30 if the averaging is performed over any quantum state that commutes with the hamiltonian . )    in general , the asymptotics of the fourier transform at large @xmath11 are related to analytic properties of the original function .",
    "however , since @xmath31 , it is sufficient to consider @xmath32 on the imaginary axis : @xmath33 . if the integral converges for @xmath34 , then @xmath28 should decay sufficiently fast , and the real - time correlator has an analytic continuation to the strip @xmath35 . if , in addition , the integral diverges for @xmath36 , then @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",

    "the cyclic property of the trace implies that both variants of the correlation function are even and real .",
    "therefore , the taylor expansion of the real - time spin correlator contains only even terms : @xmath40 d_{2n } = \\frac{(-1)^n}{s(s+1)}\\lim_{t\\rightarrow 0 } \\left\\langle\\frac{d^{2n}}{dt^{2n } } s_{j}^{c}(t ) s_{j}^{c}(0)\\right\\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\tilde{f}(\\omega)\\omega^{2n}\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}. \\label{eq : d_2n}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the moments @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "let us assume that the power series  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) has a finite convergence radius @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath32 has singularities at @xmath44 , and the frequency representation of the correlation function decays as @xmath45 for large @xmath11 . our main goal is to show that @xmath43 is nonzero and finite , and to compute its value .",
    "physically , the spin correlation function does not completely vanish at high frequencies only due to nonlinearities that allow for combining the precession frequencies of a large number of spins . to understand it qualitatively ,",
    "consider an infinite system in which each spin is coupled to @xmath46 neighbors with interaction strength @xmath3 .",
    "if an energy quantum @xmath5 is exchanged between a single spin and some external object , it has to be distributed between other spins and divided into portions of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "the most efficient processes of this kind are cascades that correspond to tree - like diagrams and do not involve any back reaction .",
    "summing over such diagrams is equivalent to the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is generally applicable for @xmath47 , but will also produce qualitatively correct results if the energy has many paths to escape , for example , on a tree with @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we assume that each spin @xmath23 precesses in the local exchange field @xmath49 produced by the spins surrounding it . the fluctuating field @xmath50 is characterized by the correlation function @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are spatial indices ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 .",
    "using the mean - field approach , we assume that @xmath56 is gaussian . the relevant energy scale in this model ( corresponding to @xmath3 in the qualitative discussion above ) is given by @xmath57 . in this approximation , the time evolution of each spin simplifies to @xmath58 , or , in a matrix form , @xmath59_{ca}s^{a}. \\label{eq : ds / dt}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 is the matrix corresponding to the cross - product with @xmath61 , and @xmath62_{ca}$ ] are its elements : @xmath63_{ca}=\\epsilon_{cab}h^{b}. \\label{eq : matr}\\ ] ] we solve equation  ( [ eq : ds / dt ] ) in a symbolic form , @xmath64_{ca}s^{a}(0)$ ] and average over the thermal state of the spin : @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the spin correlator is expressed as an average over the fluctuating fields : @xmath66 using equations  ( [ adjrep ] ) and  ( [ hh ] ) , we recursively compute the first few moments @xmath41 : @xmath67 it is unfortunately difficult to pursue this computation much further and find the asymptotic behavior of the moments .",
    "nevertheless , these recursive formulas give an exact expansion of the spin correlation function in lower orders : @xmath68    let us describe a general method for the calculation of the moments .",
    "it can be used to derive equations  ( [ rr ] ) and continue to higher orders , though we could not obtain a closed - form expression for @xmath41 .",

    "the field derivatives @xmath74 can be expressed in terms of further neighbors .",
    "so far all the calculations have been exact .",
    "now we employ the mean - field approximation and average over the thermal state of the spin , and then over the gaussian fields .",

    "the difficulty in carrying out the above calculation lies in the matrix nature of the fields @xmath60 .",
    "we now introduce two different approximations , which are expected to shift the answer in opposite directions by overestimating or underestimating the moments @xmath41 , thus giving a lower and an upper bound for @xmath43 .",
    "remarkably , we find that the two bounds are quite close in value . in our first approximation , we ignore the noncommutativity of the matrices @xmath74 , or equivalently , @xmath77 for different values of @xmath78 .",
    "more exactly , we symmetrize over all permutations of those matrices .",
