    "equivalently to say , we assume that differential equations are unramified according to the terminology of the differential galois theory . then in section 4 , we investigate the way how the twisted euler transform changes differential equations , in other words , how characteristic exponents at singular points are changed by the twisted euler transform .    in section 5 , we see the relation between differential equations and kac - moody lie algebras . in @xcite , w. crawley - boevey",

    "<S> in @xcite , n. katz introduced the notion of the middle convolution on local systems . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a generalization of the euler transform of fuchsian differential equations . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the generalization of the euler transform , the twisted euler transform , and apply this to differential equations with irregular singular points . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for differential equations with an irregular singular point of irregular rank 2 at @xmath0 , we describe explicitly changes of local datum caused by twisted euler transforms . </S>",
    "<S> also we attach these differential equations to kac - moody lie algebras and show that twisted euler transforms correspond to the actions of weyl groups of these lie algebras .    </S>",
