    "most of the light from high mass stars is emitted in the ultraviolet ( uv ; @xmath1 ) , making it an attractive passband for tracing cosmic star formation evolution .",
    "this utility is accentuated with increasing redshift as the rest - frame uv emission enters the optical where modern detectors have quantum efficiencies approaching unity .",
    "unfortunately , star formation occurs in a dusty environment , and dust efficiently absorbs and scatters uv radiation .",
    "this must also be the case in the early universe since dust has been observed in objects with @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the challenge of interpreting rest - frame uv emissivities is to devise an adequate prescription to account for dust absorption .",
    "currently there is much debate in the literature on what the proper dust correction prescription is , resulting in different groups estimating @xmath3  dust absorption factors ranging from a factor of about 3 ( e.g.  @xcite ) to 20 @xcite at @xmath4 .",
    "the amount of high-@xmath5 dust absorption has a direct bearing on interpretting how galaxies evolve .",
    "small dust corrections favor hierarchical models of galaxy formation , while large corrections favor monolithic collapse models @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the uv luminosity density at @xmath4 derived mainly from the @xmath6-dropouts in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xcite .",
    "our technique @xcite is based on the strong similarity between local starburst galaxies and lyman - break systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "in earlier works @xcite , we showed that for local uv selected starburst galaxies , the ratio of far infrared ( fir ) to uv fluxes correlates with uv spectral slope @xmath9 ( @xmath10 - @xmath9 is essentially an ultraviolet color ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "since @xmath11 is dust reprocessed uv flux , _ this empirical correlation can be used to recover the intrinsic uv flux from uv quantities alone . _ in addition , for starbursts , the @xmath12 axis can be transformed directly into a uv absorption @xcite .",
    "the fitted line is a simple linear fit to the transformed data of the form : @xmath13 .",
    "we selected our hdf @xmath6-dropout sample from a corner cut out of the @xmath14 versus @xmath15 color - color diagram ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ) and adopted the same magnitude limits as madau et  al .",
    "we select in @xmath15 instead of @xmath18 @xcite because ( 1 ) @xmath19 is less affected by the lyman forest and edge than @xmath20 , and ( 2 ) this selection yields fairly even cutoff in @xmath9 , and hence in @xmath21 .",
    "note that our selection recovers high-@xmath5 galaxies in the `` clipped corner '' of the madau et  al.@xcite selection area , and includes no known low-@xmath5 interlopers .",
    "we applied our absorption law fit to broad - band @xmath15 colors transformed into @xmath9 .",
    "the transformation was derived from high - quality iue spectra that were `` redshifted '' through the @xmath22 to 4 range of @xmath6-dropouts .",
    "the transformation is linear in color with a quadratic @xmath5 correction .",
    "the @xmath5 correction is needed to account for the lyman forest and lyman - edge creeping into the @xmath19 band at high-@xmath5 .",
    "figure  2 shows a test of our technique .",
    "it compares the ratio of ( rest frame ) optical emission line flux to uv continuum flux density for local starbursts , and seven @xmath6-dropouts @xcite .",
    "these ratios are not corrected for dust absorption .",
    "the overlap of the two samples indicates that @xmath6-dropouts are ionizing populations to the same degree as local starbursts .",
    "hence their intrinsic uv spectrum should be similar .",
    "pettini et  al .",
    "@xcite claim that @xmath6-dropouts probably suffer from little dust absorption since they tend to have fairly low @xmath23 values .",
    "however , this ratio can be misleading .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 is not a good indicator of dust absorption : it does not correlate strongly with @xmath9 , which we know to be a good indicator of dust absorption ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is the case for both the local and @xmath6-dropout samples .",
    "the reason for this was first proposed by fanelli et  al .",
    "@xcite :  emission lines are seen through a larger column of dust than than the general uv continuum thus cancelling the expected benefit in opacity of observing in the optical instead of the uv .",
    "figure  3 plots the absorption corrected absolute ab magnitude of the hdf @xmath6-dropouts versus @xmath9 .",
    "the broken lines show @xmath25 in the absence of absorption correction .",
    "the data show an apparent color - luminosity correlation .",
    "this is in part due to the selection limits , but the lack of very luminous blue galaxies is real .",
    "this implies that there is a mass - metallicity relationship at @xmath26 .",
    "it also shows that the most luminous galaxies tend to have the most dust absorption .",
    "a similar color - luminosity correlation is seen in local starbursts @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath29 is factor of 9.2 higher than @xmath30 first estimated by madau et  al .",
    "this difference is due to two effects : the dust absorption correction ( factor of 5.5 ) , and the improved @xmath6-dropout selection ( factor of 1.7 ) .",
    "these emissivities are still lower limits because we have made no completeness corrections , and because our @xmath15 selection is only sensitive to galaxies with @xmath31 mag .",
    "recently , madau et  al .",
    "@xcite ( see also madau , this volume ) have fit models to cosmological emissivity data covering rest - wavelengths from the fir to the uv and redshifts out to @xmath32 .",
    "their hdf @xmath6-dropout sample now has a selection similar to ours .",
    "our @xmath29 estimate for the @xmath6-dropouts is a factor of 2.5 larger than their preferred model , which simulates the heirarchical collapse scenario and which includes a small amount of dust absorption .",
    "however it is only 30%  larger than their `` monolithic collapse '' model .",
    "hence , the initial phase of galaxy collapse was probably more rapid than predicted by heirarchical models and somewhat obscured from our view by at least modest amounts of dust ."
