    "nonsingular solutions are playing an increasingly important role in physics .",
    "the cosmological singularity at the early universe corresponds to an infinite energy density state and therefore , it may probably be essential to consider the quantum gravity to understand the initial state of the universe .",
    "hence from the cosmological point of view , nonsingular models of the universe have special position for scientists @xcite . from gravitational viewpoint ,",
    "various regular solutions , such as gravitational instantons , solitons and horizonless magnetic branes ( string ) solutions , have become the subject of interest in recent years instanton , hirschmann , dias , magneticstring , magneticbranes , magneticstringbi , magneticbranebi , magneticstringpmi , magneticbranepmi , hendiahep .",
    "on the other hand , considering four / higher dimensional spacetimes , the cosmic strings / branes are topological defects which are inevitably formed during phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "investigation of the horizonless magnetic solutions and their relations to the topological defects helps us to think about the origin of cosmic magnetic fields vilenkin , banerjee . besides , from geometric point of view , these structures are fascinating objects , in which have no curvature singularity , no horizon , but they have a conic singularity .",
    "one of the important motivations for investigating the horizonless magnetic stings / branes comes from the fact that these kinds of solutions may be interpreted as cosmic strings / branes .",
    "the horizonless solutions of einstein and higher derivative gravity theories in the ( absence ) presence of the maxwell and dilaton fields have been studied in literature @xcite .",
    "an extension to include the nonlinear electrodynamics has also been done magneticstringbi , magneticbranebi , magneticstringpmi , magneticbranepmi , hendiahep",
    ".    the purpose of the present paper is constructing a new class of static and spinning magnetic brane solutions which produces a longitudinal magnetic field in the background of anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "these solutions are the generalization of the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite to higher dimensions and higher derivative gravity .",
    "derivation of various theories by physicists is for the reason of better description of phenomena in our universe .",
    "it has been confirmed that most of phenomena in the nature are inherently chaotic and may be described with nonlinear theories . in electrodynamics domain , although the maxwell theory is in agreement with experimental results , it fails regarding some important issues such as self energy of point - like charges which motivates us to regard nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) .",
    "ned theories may be created from various viewpoint and motivations . for more explanations of some motivations ,",
    "we refer the reader to the following brief examples ; solving the problem of point - like charge self energy , compatible with ads / cft correspondence and string theory frames , understanding the nature of different complex systems , obtaining more information and insight regarding to quantum gravity , description of pair creation for hawking radiation and the behavior of the compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and pulsars @xcite .",
    "these are some evidences that motivate one to consider ned theories .    through last decades",
    "different classes of the nonlinear theories were introduced born , hassaine , soleng , hendijhep , hendiann1,hendiann2,hendisheykhi , hendiallahverdizadeh , nedmodels . among the ned theories , the so - called born - infeld ( bi ) type theories are quite special , whose",
    "lagrangians may be originated from the string theory .",
    "it has been shown that the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory in electrodynamics side leads to a quartic correction of the maxwell field strength @xcite .",
    "moreover , one finds that all order loop corrections may be summed up as a bi type lagrangian @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been considered two kinds of bi type lagrangians to examine the possibility of black hole solutions soleng , hendijhep , hendiann1,hendiann2,hendisheykhi , hendiallahverdizadeh .",
    "although there are some analogues between the bi type theories , one can find that there exist some differences between them .    in recent years",
    "a renewed interest has grown in higher dimensional spacetime as well as higher dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "the main reason comes from the fact that these theories emerge in the effective low - energy action of string theory in gravitational side @xcite .",
    "one of the special classes of higher derivative modifications of einstein ( en ) gravity is the lovelock theory @xcite which is a ghost free model @xcite . regarding the postulates of general relativity , most of physicists believe that the lovelock lagrangian is a natural generalization of the en gravity to higher dimensions .",
    "besides , lovelock gravity may solve some of problems of the einstein theory such as the normalization problem , and hence it is a well - defined model stelle , farhoudi , witt . in this paper , we consider the lovelock gravity in presence of two classes of bi type ned models and obtain their horizonless solutions .",
    "we also investigate the effect of ned as a correction to the maxwell theory .",
    "the layout of this paper will be this : first we introduce the suitable field equations regarding to the lovelock gravity coupled with different magnetic sources that we are interested in .",
    "next , we obtain static solutions for metric function .",
    "then , we will consider spinning magnetic string and by employing counterterm method , we calculate conserved quantities .",

    "these figures indicate that there exist regions , in which calculated values of deficit angle for different dimensions lead to almost same result and it is almost independent of dimensions .    here , we present a geometric interpretation for negative deficit angle . considering a two dimensional plain",
    ", we can cut segment of a certain angular size and then sew together the edges to obtain a conical surface .",
    "the deleted segment from the plan is known as deficit angle with positive values .",
    "now , we imagine a new situation when a segment is added to a new plane to obtain a flat surface with a saddle - like cone ( for more details one can see fig .",
    "@xmath206 in ref .",
    "this added segment is corresponding to a negative deficit angle ( or surplus angle ) @xcite .",
    "we should mention that although the deleted segment is bounded by the value of @xmath207 the added segment is unbounded .",
    "we conclude that the range of deficit angles is from @xmath208 to @xmath207 .    @xmath209",
    "in this paper , we supposed that the geometry and matter field of spacetime come from the lovelock gravity and ned . at first",
    ", we considered a suitable static metric to find horizonless magnetic solutions .",
    "we found that for having the real electromagnetic field , we should consider a lower bound ( @xmath210 ) for the coordinate @xmath32 .",
    "we discussed the geometric properties of en , gb and tol solutions and found that although these solutions have no curvature singularity , there is a conical singularity at @xmath211 with a deficit angle @xmath212 , where one can interpret @xmath113 as the mass per unit volume of the magnetic brane .",
    "in addition , we found that both the ned and the lovelock gravity do not affect the asymptotically behavior of the solutions , and in other words , obtained solutions are asymptotically ads .",
    "we obtained deficit angle of the conical geometry and investigated the effects of lovelock gravity and ned . at first , calculated values for deficit angle showed that it is independent of the gb and the tol parameters .",
    "in other words , we found that the lovelock parameters do not affect the deficit angle .",
    "this result comes from the fact that the value of second derivatives of metric function does not depend on the lovelock coefficients which is the consequence of geometric properties of @xmath213 and @xmath214 hypersurface ( this hypersurface is a ricci flat manifold ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to property of ricci - flat black holes in higher orders of the lovelock gravity , in which their horizons and conserved quantities of black hole do not depend on the lovelock parameters .",
    "we also investigated the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "although both enef and lnef branches are bi type , they have different nature .",
    "we found that there is a minimum value for the nonlinearity parameter where for @xmath215 the deficit angle was not real .",
    "this is because of the behavior of lambert function which is present in enef branch and the logarithmic function which is appeared in lnef branch .",
    "we also showed that considering higher dimensional solutions , @xmath216 may be changed and for certain dimensions , the deficit angle is real for arbitrary @xmath24 ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "we found that the deficit angle is an increasing function of nonlinearity parameter in enef whereas for lnef it showed opposite behavior .",
    "we also saw that increasing the charge parameter leads to increasing @xmath118 while for increasing @xmath79 , the value of @xmath216 decreased .",
    "looking at the behavior of deficit angle versus @xmath79 , we found that there is an @xmath120 where for @xmath218 , the deficit angle is real valued .",
    "moreover , we found that for small values of the nonlinearity parameter , the deficit angle is only an increasing function of @xmath191 whereas for increasing value of @xmath126 there will be @xmath123 in which for @xmath219 the deficit angle is a decreasing function of @xmath79 and for @xmath220 it increases as @xmath79 increases .",
    "next step was devoted to introduce spinning magnetic branes which is horizonless .",
    "we found that for rotating magnetic branes there is an electric field in addition to the magnetic one .",
    "we employed the gauss law and the counterterm method to calculate the electric charge , finite mass and angular momentum of rotating magnetic brane solutions .",
    "we found that the electric charge is proportional to the rotation parameters and it vanishes for the static solutions ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "we should note that vanishing the electric charge for @xmath175 is due the fact that the electric field , @xmath176 , vanishes for the static solutions .    as one can see for the weak nonlinearity power , the obtained deficit angle for different theories of nonlinearity has different values comparing to the maxwell theory .",
    "one may argue that , for large values of @xmath126 , the obtained values for deficit angle , should lead to those of the maxwell theory and support this statement with fact that for large values of @xmath126 , these two electromagnetic fields become maxwell theory .",
    "this idea is an acceptable one , when we are only dealing with the electromagnetic fields .",
    "but in calculation of deficit angle , we are using the second derivation of metric function . due to different structures of nonlinear theories ( logarithmic and exponential ones )",
    ", it is most likely that this property of these two nonlinear electrodynamics ( for large values of @xmath24 , they lead to the maxwell theory ) is not preserved and therefore , the obtained values are different . in other words",
    ", one may expect to see different values for deficit angle even for large values of nonlinearity parameter and they are not necessarily the same as maxwell ones .",
    "it means that , although these two types of nonlinear theory are bi type and for @xmath221 they lead to same result , they are completely different theories with their different characteristics and properties .    in addition we found that plotted graph for the maxwell theory , presents a divergency which is due to root(s ) of @xmath222 . while for considering nonlinear theories , the divergency vanishes and calculated values of deficit angle and plotted graphs showed no divergency .",
    "in other words , in process of going from linear theory ( maxwell ) to a nonlinear theory ( logarithmic form or exponential one ) , calculated values of deficit angle will be divergence free and it has smooth behavior .",
    "therefore , considering nonlinear theories , changes properties of solutions and solve the problems regarding the linear theory which is of the primary motivation of considering nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "it is notable , that considering nonlinear theories put some restriction on values . in other words , there is a region in which the calculated values of deficit angle are not real . but",
    "this region is not where the divergency of the maxwell theory exists .",
    "in other words , by considering suitable value of nonlinearity parameter , one can cover regions in which the maxwell theory has divergency .",
    "later , we investigated the effects of nonlinearity as a correction .",
    "we found that this theory despite other two nonlinear theories ( logarithmic and exponential ones ) is always real value and there is no region in which deficit angle is imaginary .",
    "plotted graphs of this theory also showed that , variation of nonlinearity parameter is only effective in a region ( @xmath223 ) and in other regions ( @xmath224 , @xmath225 ) , it is almost independence of this variation .",
    "same behavior was seen for the effects of dimensions as well .",
    "it was shown that , the construction of this theory is in a way that for small and large values of @xmath79 the effect of nonlinearity part , decreases rapidly and almost vanishes and the structure of magnetic branes ( cone - like ) is similar to the maxwell theory and it is as if there is no correction part . on the other hand for small values of correction parameter , not only it did not solve divergency of the maxwell field , but it also added another divergency to it . in other words ,",
    "two divergencies in the case of very weak correction parameter were seen in mc theory .",
    "this shows the fact that , this theory of nonlinearity and its deficit angle are quite sensitive to modification of correction parameter .",
    "this sensitivity is stronger even for small values of correction parameter .",
    "although for some regions the calculated values of deficit angle are almost same as the one for the maxwell theory , there is an effective range in which nonlinearity ( correction ) will be dominant and has the most contribution in deficit angle .    other interesting issues in the results were existence of the negative , root and divergencies for deficit angle .",
    "positive deficit angle is representing a cone like structure for the object . whereas the negative deficit angle is denoted as extra angle which is know as surplus angle @xcite .",
    "this extra angle changes the shape of the object into a saddle like cone .",
    "finally it is worthwhile to think about the physical properties deficit angle as well as surplus one .",
    "in addition , one may investigate the possible wormhole solutions @xcite of the mentioned models , this works are under examination .",
