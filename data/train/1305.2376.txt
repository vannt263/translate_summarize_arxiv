    "carbon monoxide was also detected in the brown dwarf gliese 229b , but the predicted co abundance obtained from lte spectral modeling was @xmath6 times larger than the value computed using local chemical equilibrium models @xcite .    in the majority of low - density environments , the level populations of molecules typically depart from lte . as a consequence , to accurately predict spectral line intensities , rate coefficients for collisional excitation due to the impact of the dominant species , h@xmath7 , h , and he , are necessary . for co rotational excitation in collision with h atoms , one of the earliest quantum calculations was carried out by @xcite using semiempirical potentials .",
    "they presented rate coefficients for 5 - 150 k. green & thaddeus ( 1976 ) performed another early quantal scattering calculation for the co - h system over the same temperature range , but using different semiempirical potentials . from their calculations , it was found that the collisional rate coefficients for co with h were significantly smaller than those of co by h@xmath7 , so that the contribution of co - h collisions was usually neglected in later co emission modeling .",
    "later theoretical investigations on the co - h collision system have been motivated by the availability of ab initio pess with increasing sophistication .",
    "an early ab initio surface was obtained by @xcite , the so - called bbh pes .",
    "bbh has a barrier , with a calculated height of 0.087 ev @xcite , to the formation of the radical hco .",
    "it was demonstrated from a later scattering calculation by lee & bowman ( 1987 ) , using the bbh surface , that for collision energies below the barrier , a homonuclear - like behavior was observed for the state - to - state rotational excitation cross sections , i.e. , the cross sections displayed an even-@xmath8 propensity .",
    "keller et al . ( 1996 ) constructed another ab initio pes for the co - h system using the multireference configuration - interaction ( mrci ) method .",
    "they reported that this pes , called the wks surface , gave better agreement with experimental spectroscopy than the bbh surface . using both the bbh and wks potentials , green et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed scattering calculations for co rotational excitation .",
    "cross sections on the two potentials revealed significant discrepancies , particularly for the @xmath40  @xmath5  1 transition .",
    "these calculations were revisited by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* byd ) , who verified the differences in the cross sections obtained in the bbh and wks surfaces observed by @xcite .",
    "byd , however , used the wks pes to compute a large set of co - h rotational excitation data .",
    "subsequently , the byd rate coefficients have been used in a variety of astrophysical models .",
    "for example , @xcite , adopted the co - h rotational excitation rate coefficients of byd to investigate co rotational populations in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "based on comparisons to observations , @xcite argued that h impact excitation makes an important contribution to the co rotational populations and should be included in models .",
    "as argued by lee & bowman ( 1987 ) , an even-@xmath8 propensity is likely to be valid for co. however , it was later pointed out by @xcite that the excitation rate coefficients of byd from initial @xmath9 failed to obey the homonuclear - like propensity for even-@xmath8 transitions , because the computed @xmath10 rate coefficients are larger than the @xmath11 rate coefficients .    in order to investigate this apparent departure from the expected behavior ,",
    "two completely independent co - h rigid - rotor pess were constructed in @xcite using state - of - the - art methodologies in quantum chemistry .",
    "one of the pess was computed using the coupled - cluster singles - and - doubles - with - perturbative - triples method ( ccsd(t ) ) together with the frozen - core approximation @xcite , hereafter referred as the ccsd potential . in the ccsd potential calculation ,",
    "the doubly augmented correlation consistent basis set of woon & dunning ( 1994 ) , d - aug - cc - pvnz , n = t , q , and 5 , was adopted .",
    "the second surface was constructed using the complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) method @xcite with the internally contracted mrci approach @xcite based on aug - cc - pvqz basis sets , hereafter referred to as the mrci potential .",
    "quantum - mechanical close - coupling ( cc ) computations of the cross sections for initial state @xmath9 were carried out by @xcite on the two pess at kinetic energies of 400 and 800 @xmath12 .",
    "the state - to - state cross sections on both pess showed even-@xmath8 propensity with odd-@xmath8 transitions being significantly suppressed .",
    "in a subsequent investigation of the formation and excitation of co in diffuse clouds @xcite , the rotational excitation temperature for the @xmath3=1  @xmath5  0 transition was recomputed using the co - h rotational excitation rate coefficients of @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out by liszt ( 2007 ) that the observations are better reproduced with these smaller co - h rotational excitation rate coefficients .    as discussed in @xcite , the deficiency in the long - range part of the wks pes results in the inaccurate rate coefficients . for odd @xmath8 ,",
    "the rate coefficients are typically too large , and if implemented in astrophysical models , can lead to questionable astrophysical deductions .",
    "however , due to the lack of more accurate rate coefficients for the co - h system , the byd values are still adopted .",
    "examples include a study of molecular excitation in interstellar shock waves by flower and pineau des forts ( 2010 ) , an investigation of the molecular regions of the supernova remnants ic443c , w28 , w44 , and 3c391 and the herbig - hero objects hh7 and hh54 @xcite , and in radiation thermo - chemical models of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
