    "new spectral intensity around @xmath0 begins to emerge and becomes enough strong at optimal doping @xmath8 , indicating the formation of the new fs pocket around @xmath0 .",
    "the arpes data have been explained within the two - band model in consideration of the af order @xcite or by numerically considering the af short - range correlation.@xcite according to the two - band analysis , at low doping only the upper af band is crossed by the fermi level around @xmath23 , leading to the small fs pocket around @xmath23",
    ". with increasing doping the af order weakens so that the lower band , with the maximum at @xmath0 , approaches the fermi level and contributes the new spectral intensity around @xmath0 .",
    "the question is at which doping the lower band will be crossed by the fermi level . as seen from the arpes data on ncco at @xmath24 ( fig .  2 of ref .  )",
    ", the lower band is still away from the fermi level , although it is close to the latter and thus contributes weak spectral intensity around @xmath0 in the intensity map ( fig .  1 of ref .  ) . in view that the lower band lifts continuously with increasing doping",
    ", we naturally imagine that it does not touch the fermi level until @xmath25 .",
    "that is to say , in nearly the whole underdoped regime @xmath26 , the real fs pocket around @xmath0 has not yet formed .    on the other hand , as far as we know , many experimental measurements to study the sc pairing symmetry only give direct information about the quasiparticle excitation gap , and not the sc order parameter .",
    "for example , from the low temperature dependence of the penetration depth ( exponential function or power law ) , one can only infer whether the quasiparticle excitation has a finite gap or not .",
    "it must be noted that a finite quasiparticle excitation gap , which was actually obtained by e.g. kim _ et al._,@xcite does not necessarily mean a nodeless sc order parameter .",
    "here our essential idea is : the quasiparticle excitation gap may be finite and look _ s_-wave - like , but the sc order parameter is _ d_-wave and has nodes .",
    "this possibility becomes true if the nodal line of the sc order parameter does not cross the fs .",
    "such a case is exactly exhibited above in the underdoped regime where the fs is lacking around @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , even if the sc order parameter is _",
    "d_-wave which vanishes along the line @xmath2 , the quasiparticle excitation is still gapped due to the absence of the fs across that line .    as indicated above",
    ", it is of general interest to investigate how the quasiparticle property varies with the intrinsic fs evolution with doping in e - doped cuprates .",
    "this guides us to conceive the following scenario to largely reconcile the experimental discrepancies .",
    "simply we assume that the sc order parameter is @xmath1-wave at all doping levels .",
    "this is consistent with the phase sensitive experiments @xcite on optimally doped ncco and pcco and overdoped ncco as well as the arpes measurements @xcite on optimally doped ncco . in view of the fs evolution",
    ", we expect that the quasiparticle excitation will have a finite , i.e. , _ s_-wave - like gap in the underdoped regime and zero gap in the optimally and overdoped regime . then those penetration depth measurements to support the _",
    "s_-wave gap might be consistently understood if nominally optimally or overdoped samples in those measurements are in reality underdoped .",

    "in conclusion , we have explored an intrinsic physical mechanism , based on the fs evolution with doping , to understand the diverse experimental results on the sc pairing symmetry in e - doped cuprates .",
    "we argue that the fs pocket around @xmath0 has not yet formed until doping reaches about the optimal value .",
    "therefore , in the underdoped regime , even if the sc pairing order parameter is @xmath1-wave which vanishes along the diagonal line , the quasiparticle excitation is still gapped which shows a @xmath3-wave - like behavior due to the absence of the fs across that line . to demonstrate this idea ,",
    "we have elaborated a theory with consideration of coexisting af and sc orders in e - doped cuprates .",
    "the variations of the quasiparticle property and electronic dos are exhibited as the fs evolves from underdoping to overdoping .",
    "the physical quantities heat capacity and superfluid density are calculated and their low temperature dependences are compared at different doping levels .",
    "our study gives new understanding of some measurements which actually detected the @xmath3-wave character of the quasiparticle excitation ( rather than the sc order parameter ) and thus tends to reconcile the apparently contradictory experimental results .",
    "we have also predicted the remarkable double - peak feature in the dos for the e - doped cuprates at optimal doping which have a segmented fs .",
    "this work was supported by the texas center for superconductivity at the university of houston and the robert a. welch foundation under grant no .",
    "we consider the following two steps to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) , which is explicitly @xmath177    first , we use the rotational transformations to remove the hopping term between @xmath1 and @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath178 with [ see eqs .",
    "( [ cosphi ] ) and ( [ sinphi ] ) for the choice of @xmath65 ] @xmath180 in terms of the new operators @xmath181 and @xmath182 , ( [ hk ] ) turns into @xmath183 where the pairing term is formally unchanged .",
    "second , we adopt the bogliubov transformations @xmath184 with [ see eqs .",
    "( [ costhe ] ) and ( [ sinthe ] ) for the choice of @xmath66 ] @xmath186 then ( [ hkb ] ) is diagonalized into @xmath187\\nonumber\\\\ & & + n(um^2+v\\delta^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exactly the hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) .",
    "if all the transformations ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) are integrated , we will arrive at the global transformation @xmath55 with @xmath63 given by eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) .",
    "with division of the original lattice into two sublattices , one has the following correspondence for the operators @xmath188 and @xmath189 in momentum space [ @xmath190 @xmath191 where @xmath53 is restricted into the magnetic bz .",
    "then the green s functions for the original @xmath188-electron can be expressed as follows , with help of the matrix elements [ denoted by @xmath192 of @xmath159 , @xmath193 where the coefficient @xmath194 for @xmath195  ( @xmath196 ) is introduced .",
    "all the above equations are also valid for the fourier transformed functions after the replacement @xmath197 .          where the last equation holds if the definitions for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath61 are extended to the original bz .",
    "therefore , no matter @xmath53 is within or beyond the magnetic bz , @xmath95 has the unified form ( [ gs1 ] ) . analytical continuation @xmath202 for",
    "@xmath95 will lead to eq .",
