    "the maximal abelian gauge is obtained in @xmath0 gauge theory by maximizing the lattice functional @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the diagonal generators of the fundamental representation of @xmath0 .",
    "the maximization is done by performing local @xmath0 gauge transformations on the links , which in practice is done using an @xmath4 subgroup update@xcite .",
    "once the maximal abelian gauge is obtained , two independent abelian gauge fields are projected out , leaving @xmath5 gauge fields .",
    "magnetic monopoles are then identified in the abelian configurations .",
    "the lattice monopoles are used to directly compute the heavy quark potential@xcite .",
    "the indirect center gauge was used in the first lattice studies of projected center vortices in @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the indirect center gauge is obtained in the following way .",
    "a non - abelian lattice gauge configuration is fixed to the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "abelian projection is performed obtaining the abelian subgroup configurations : in @xmath4 this procedure obtains @xmath6 gauge fields , while in @xmath7 it yields @xmath8^{n-1}$ ] gauge fields .",
    "the remaining @xmath6 configurations are then gauge fixed so that the gauge fields are brought as close as possible to the elements of the center group of the original @xmath7 theory . for the case of @xmath4",
    "this corresponds to maximizing @xmath9 where @xmath10 parameterizes the abelian links .",
    "the maximization is obtained by iteratively performing @xmath6 gauge transformations .",
    "the final step to extract the vortices involves another projection of the lattice gauge fields onto the group elements of @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unit matrix .    in @xmath0 after maximal abelian gauge fixing and projection is done , the links are elements of @xmath13",
    ". the @xmath13 links can be parameterized by the matrix : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath5 gauge transformations are then applied to these links to bring them as close as possible to the elements of the @xmath0 center group ,    @xmath16    the necessary gauge transformations can be parameterized using the fundamental , diagonal generators of @xmath0 :    @xmath17    where some numerical factors are absorbed into the @xmath18 s and we use @xmath19 @xmath20    the center gauge in @xmath7 is obtained by maximizing the quantity @xmath21 for the indirect case in @xmath0 , this is accomplished by applying the @xmath5 gauge transformations described above to the diagonal @xmath13 links to maximize the quantity @xmath22 gauge transformations must be applied iteratively to each site independently to maximize the global quantity .",
    "there are two local gauge conditions that must be met when the center gauge has been obtained .",
    "the first condition comes from the @xmath23 contribution : @xmath24&=0,\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the lattice derivative @xmath26 the second gauge condition to be met comes from the @xmath3 contribution : @xmath27&=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] numerically , neither term can actually be zero . in practice ,",
    "numerical iterations are continued until both terms are on the order of @xmath28 . in the continuum",
    "these two gauge conditions are equivalent to the landau gauge :    @xmath29 @xmath30",
    "we generated 400 equilibrium @xmath0 lattice configurations on a @xmath31 lattice with @xmath32 .",
    "at this value of @xmath33 the correlation length is about 4 lattice spacings . using these configurations and smearing techniques@xcite we computed the heavy quark potential and measured the full @xmath0 string tension , @xmath34 .",
    "we found @xmath35 .",
    "next , the 400 configurations were fixed to the maximal abelian gauge and the two species of abelian fields@xcite were projected out .",
    "overrelaxation was used with @xmath36@xcite . in each abelian configuration dirac strings",
    "were located using the @xmath37 plaquettes and the two species of monopole configurations were obtained .",
    "the monopole configurations were used to compute the heavy quark potential ( see fig .",
    "( 2 ) below ) .",
    "results for both monopole species were found to be the same .",
    "the string tension from the potential computed using monopoles was found to be @xmath38 .",
    "this is about @xmath39 lower than the full @xmath0 string tension @xmath34 .",
    "we believe this is the first quantitative calculation of the su(3 ) string tension from monopoles , although hints that the monopole string tension is low have appeared before@xcite .",
    "after gathering the abelian configurations , we next applied our abelian center gauge fixing algorithm .",
    "no closed form solution of the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 could be found for the transcendental equations resulting from maximizing @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath18 s were determined iteratively .",
    "the value of the normalized abelian trace computed from using the @xmath13 links was observed to change from an average value of 0.525 before center gauge fixing to 0.922 after gauge fixing .    from the center gauge fixed configurations ,",
    "the links were replaced by the @xmath43 phase each was closest to .",
    "wilson loops were computed using the @xmath43 configurations .",
    "the wilson loop data is presented in figure  ( 1 ) .",
    "fits to the potential computed using the @xmath43 wilson loops gave a string tension of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we find the string tension from indirect center projection to be too low .    in figure  ( 2 )",
    "we compare the heavy quark potentials .",
    "the potentials computed from the monopoles and projected center vortices show little coulomb behavior at small @xmath45 as compared to the full @xmath0 potential .",
    "this has been observed in other calculations in @xmath4 and @xmath6@xcite .",
    "calculations which demonstrate the confinement mechanism are not required to reproduce the short distance behavior of the potential , only the string tension .",
    "we have presented results for the string tension computed using monopoles and center vortices .",
    "the calculations use operations defined at the level of a single lattice spacing .",
    "neither monopoles nor center vortices reproduce the full @xmath0 string tension .",
    "there is still a need to refine the methods used here if one is to discard or accept monopoles or center vortices as the confinement mechanism in qcd .",
    "we conclude by discussing possible reasons to suspect systematic errors exist in these calculations .",
    "monopoles and vortices are computed using objects defined on the single link level .",
    "the results for the string tension may be corrupted by unphysical degrees of freedom due to misidentification of monopoles and center vortices by using operators defined at the single link level .",
    "also , we may not be using volumes large enough to suppress finite volume effects since monopoles and center vortices are objects that likely extend over many lattice spacings . to investigate the first problem",
    ", we need to construct other methods for identifying monopoles and center vortices . for the second problem",
    "we need to work on larger lattices .",
    "using larger lattices is difficult due to the computationally intensive nature of the gauge fixing methods .",
    "the numerical procedures for the maximal abelian and center gauge fixing suffer from gribov copy problems .",
    "in particular , for the direct and indirect center gauge fixing procedures in @xmath4 the effects of gribov copies on the numerical value of the string tension are large@xcite .",
    "the effect of taking account of the gribov ambiguity for @xmath4 for all cases investigated so far , is to decrease the corresponding string tension .",
    "so for monopoles in the maximal abelian gauge , the monopole string tension for one gauge fix / configuration is quite close to the full @xmath4 value @xcite , and decreases by @xmath46 when account is taken of the gribov ambiguity by generating many copies / configuration @xcite .",
    "our result for the @xmath0 monopole string tension is considerably lower than the full @xmath0 value even at one gauge fix / configuration , and would presumably be reduced somewhat more when gauge ambiguities are accounted for .",
    "thus the @xmath4 and @xmath0 cases appear to be rather different . given the large noise level of our data , we did not succeed in extracting a string tension at the @xmath5 level , before projecting to monopoles or vortices .",
    "given our low results for the monopole and center vortex string tensions , this is now an important quantity to measure . a failure of abelian projection at the @xmath13 level for @xmath0 would have important implications for ideas on confinement in @xmath0 .",
    "we plan to return to this question in future work .",
