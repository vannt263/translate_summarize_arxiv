    "<S> one way to achieve this interlinking is to find a method to convert quantum information held within superconducting circuits into quantum information held in optical photons within one node ( or interface ) , then transmit the photons over an optical fibre , and finally reconvert the photonic quantum information back into the target distant superconducting chip .    </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] +    we begin by describing the schematic configuration for our quantum interface / node and later how to use two distant nodes to achieve quantum state transfer i.e. a quantum network ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> each node works as a quantum interface and composes of a fabry - prot cavity , an ensemble of spins and a gap tunable four - josephson - junction ( 4jj ) flux qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this 4jj flux qubit is fabricated on top of a suitable substrate ( dark plane ) fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . in order to optically couple the ensemble of spins in a crystal chip </S>",
    "<S> , a round hole is cut in the main loop of the flux qubit such that the light in the fabry - prot cavity can pass through it without significant absorption and scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal chip covers the hole . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal chip is cut so that the [ 001 ] direction is along the @xmath8axis , perpendicular to the plane of the flux qubit and parallel with the axis of the optical cavity . in this arrangement , the spin ensemble can effectively couple to both of the cavity mode and the magnetic field created by the flux qubit ( see supplementary material for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that an optical coherent control field irradiates the crystal chip at almost normal incidence to the chip . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss the swapping of quantum information between the flux qubit and the optical cavity mode in a single node / interface but later will consider the quantum transfer between two nodes @xmath9 ( the source ) , and @xmath10 ( the target ) , which are optically connected via a unidirectional optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the latter only allows optical propagation along one direction , from node @xmath9 to node @xmath10 and can be realized using optical circulators @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the optical subsystem of each node and the unidirectional optical fibre couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the optical cavity mode @xmath11 in the @xmath12 node ( @xmath13 ) has a resonance frequency @xmath14 and an intrinsic decay rate @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it couples to an output optical fiber with a coupling rate @xmath16 and connects to the other node via this fiber . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total decay rate becomes @xmath17 , and we assume @xmath18 with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 represents the photon loss in the transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 denote the couplings into the waveguide connecting the two distant nodes . </S>",
    "<S> in this two node network , the lindblad superoperator describing the one - way quantum connection breaking the time symmetry is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode in node a ( b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we next describe the crystal chip spin ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we model the collection of electron spins as ensemble of three - level systems , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these could be either a collection of @xmath26 centers in diamond @xcite or rare earth ion crystal such as @xmath27 ions in @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each spin system consists of three levels : the optical excited state @xmath29 , and two electronic ground states @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the case of the @xmath26 we have @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> while for the @xmath27 system we have latexmath:[$\\ { |r_j\\rangle , |g_j\\rangle,|e_j\\rangle\\}=\\{|^4{\\bf i}_{13/2},y_1\\rangle_j ,     the excited state @xmath29 decays to the state @xmath30 ( @xmath34 ) with a rate @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . due to the coupling to the magnetic environment , the state @xmath34 also decays to @xmath30 with the rate @xmath37 and suffers pure dephasing of a rate @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we can describe the ensemble of spins within each each node with the hamiltonian ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-component of the usual spin-1/2 pauli operators @xmath43 for the @xmath4th spin , @xmath44 is the zero - field splitting with @xmath45 for the @xmath26[@xmath27 ] centers , @xmath47 is the energy of the optical excited state @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in the above hamiltonian describes the magnetic interaction with the spins with @xmath48 being the land @xmath49 factor of the spin . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath49-factor of the electronic spin in @xmath27 can be up to @xmath50 @xcite , which is much larger than in @xmath26 centers where @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 is the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> here we neglect the terms related to the strain - induced splitting because they are very small and only shift the energy of state @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the 4jj flux qubit can be modeled as a two - level system with the excite state @xmath54 and the ground state @xmath55 , and can be tuned by the flux biases @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the flux @xmath57 threading through the @xmath58 loop is used to tune the gap @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath60 to the @xmath58 loop and thus tune the gap of qubit . </S>",
    "<S> thus the free hamiltonian of the gap tunable flux qubit becomes @xmath61 , where @xmath62 with @xmath63 , ( @xmath64 is the external flux threading the qubit loop , @xmath65 the flux quantum and @xmath66 the persistent current ) , is the energy bias and @xmath67 is the tunnel splitting dependent on the bias @xmath57 , and @xmath68 . in the vicinity of @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the flux qubit associated pauli spin - half operators are defined as @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay and pure dephasing rates of the excited state of the flux qubit @xmath54 are denoted as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the tripartite interaction between the ensemble of spins , the cavity mode and the flux qubit within an individual node and which are graphically summarized in fig [ fig : setup](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an optical raman transition between the two spin ground states @xmath30 and @xmath34 formed through a combination of the external driving classical optical field and the quantum optical cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> this optical driving of an individual spin at position @xmath75 together with the cavity mode @xmath76 drives the transition of @xmath77 with a rate @xmath78 and a phase @xmath79 , where the latter is dependent on the position @xmath75 and the wave vector @xmath80 of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the the coherent laser field @xmath81 , with the frequency @xmath82 and chirped phase @xmath83 , drives the transition of @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation in the coherent driving is taken into account by @xmath85 and @xmath78 . in the dispersive regime , these optical transitions form a raman transition between the two ground states @xmath30 and @xmath34 , which is also arranged to dispersively couple to the flux qubit . such optical @xmath86type configuration has been demonstrated in both ensemble of @xmath26 centers @xcite , and @xmath27 host crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diamond crystal chip is synthesized with ( 001 ) surface orientation such that the magnetic field generated by the flux qubit has a component orthogonal to the principal ( @xmath42 ) axes of the nv centers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian of the coupled system within one node is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the first - order sideband transition and adiabatically eliminate the optical excited state @xmath29 , then the hamiltonian in the one - excitation space ( oes ) becomes ( see supplementary information ) @xmath88 \\,,\\nonumber \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the chirp of the coherent driving . here </S>",
    "<S> we define the detuning @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 means the statistical ensemble average . </S>",
    "<S> we have the identity @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> under the two - photon resonance condition , @xmath99 , and we also have , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 $ ] , and we define the operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 , while @xmath105 is the bessel function of the first kind . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath106 with @xmath107 , and set @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , with @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the detuning @xmath111 and the parameters @xmath112 are fixed once the setup is fabricated . </S>",
    "<S> a major advantage of our sideband transition configuration is that it allows one to modulate the coupling rate within the triparite configuration of flux - spin ensemble - optical mode . </S>",
    "<S> this flexibility will later permit us to use stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) for quantum transfer and this has tremendous advantage as regards robustness to noise and parameter imprecision over fixed on - resonance coupling schemes for transfer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now consider the swap of quantum information between the flux qubit and the optical cavity mode via the spin ensemble in one interface . </S>",
    "<S> we first determine a good model for the spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening in the transition frequencies and coupling rates . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the spins into @xmath113 groups and consider small inhomogeneities between the groups for the coupling rates @xmath78 , and transitions frequencies @xmath44 , and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces quite precisely the rabi oscillations observed in the experimental observation @xcite ( see supplementary material ) , and we use this model for our numerical investigations below . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the jaynes cummings coupling rates @xmath114 , and @xmath78 , are the cooperative coupling rates of the @xmath4th group which is increased by a factor @xmath115 with respect to the single - spin coupling rate . unlike the quantum memory by zhu et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the strength of the overall magnetic coupling rate between the spin ensemble and the flux qubit is limited by the applicable thickness of the crystal chip hosting the spins . we will find that crystal chip must be quite thin to avoid degradation of the transfer fidelity due to phase mismatching and this reduced thickness restricts the degree of achievable magnetic coupling .    to swap quantum information from the flux qubit to the cavity mode we perform a two - photon resonant stirap transfer of the population from the flux qubit to the optical cavity , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : swap ] . </S>",
    "<S> the system is initially populated in the excited state of the flux qubit , @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> we modulate the coherent optical driving @xmath3 and the flux bias @xmath117 such that two rabi frequencies are gaussian functions given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 with the amplitude @xmath120 , of the coherent classical optical control field . to minimize the operation time </S>",
    "<S> , the three subsystems interact on - resonance such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 yielding @xmath123 . for @xmath124 </S>",
    "<S> , we can finish the swap operation before the loss of the excitation due to any decay within the system . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of this stirap transfer is that the excitation of the spins is greatly suppressed . as a result , the detrimental effect of the inhomogeneous broadening of the spins is very small . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : swap ] shows how well our stirap - based swap scheme works for @xmath126 , @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> such high quality flux qubits @xcite and fabry - prot cavities @xcite are available using existing experimental technology . to perform the stirap control the pulse @xmath128 follows the pulse @xmath129 with a delay @xmath130 and @xmath131   ( @xmath132 , see supplementary material ) . at @xmath133 , the fidelity of the photonic state @xmath134 reaches its maximum , @xmath135 corresponding to a population of @xmath136 . </S>",

    "<S> a more detailed discussion can be found in section v of the supplementary material . both the swapping and remote transfer of the quantum information require a strong coupling between the flux qubit and the spins </S>",
    "<S> . however the physical size of the spin ensemble is constrained by the area of the flux qubit and also the crystal chip must be quite thin to reduce the detrimental effects of optical phase mis - match on the transfer fidelity . due to their large electron @xmath170factors , rare earth ions like @xmath27 , can provide a coupling rate of about @xmath171   which is large enough for our task . </S>",
