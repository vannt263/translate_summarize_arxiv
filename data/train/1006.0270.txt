    "the @xmath1 cross section is set to be the perturbative qcd cross section regulated by a debye screening mass , i.e. , @xmath11 in the above formula , @xmath12 is the strong interaction coupling constant and @xmath13 is the debye screening mass . the debye screening mass is calculated dynamically via @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume of the cell and the sum goes over all gluons in the cell .",
    "the effect of dynamical screening can be demonstrated by comparing the collision rate with the expansion rate . in a fixed box ,",
    "evolution from a pressure anisotropy different from @xmath10 is characterized by the collision rate only .",
    "however , when the system undergoes longitudinal expansion , there is a tendency of evolving toward @xmath16 pressure anisotropy .",
    "the initial pressure anisotropy and the expansion rate are responsible for how fast this happens .",
    "it is the competition between collision and expansion that determines whether pressure isotropization can happen . for the simple case when",

    "therefore , even if the initial expansion rate is large and there is a large initial pressure anisotropy , resulting in a decrease of pressure anisotropy toward @xmath16 , the collision rate will eventually take over and pressure anisotropy will evolve toward @xmath10 .",

    "first , let us focus on panel ( b ) and discuss some of the general features of the evolutions .",
    "there are two curves for the case including @xmath0 .",
    "one is for the case starting with an initial isotropic distribution , i.e. , initial @xmath33 . the other is for the case with an inside - outside type of initial distribution , i.e. , initial @xmath34 .",
    "even though they start from quite different initial pressure anisotropies , they approach the same asymptotic evolution at late times . in other words , the memory of initial anisotropy is lost after some characteristic time .",
    "the case with only @xmath1 collisions has approximately the same behavior . the two curves approach and meet each other at late times .",
    "this feature is the same for all other cases .",
    "the importance of radiative processes is reflected in the difference of the radiative case and the case with only elastic collisions .",
    "the radiative case has a pressure anisotropy of about 0.78 at 2 fm/@xmath3 , significantly larger than that of the elastic only case of 0.65 .",
    "this shows that radiative processes can significantly enhance thermalization .    when @xmath12 decreases from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , the asymptotic value at 2 fm/@xmath3 decreases for both the case with @xmath0 and without @xmath0 .",
    "when the initial energy density increases from @xmath37 gev/@xmath6 , the case with @xmath0 increases slightly leading to an approximate @xmath12 scaling insensitive to the initial energy density .",
    "in contrast , the case with only the @xmath1 process increases drastically . because of the slight increase in the radiative case and drastic increase in the elastic only case as the energy density increases , when the initial energy density @xmath9 gev/@xmath6 , the radiative and elastic only cases have about the same pressure anisotropy at @xmath38 fm/@xmath3 .",
    "the elastic only case is sensitive to both the initial energy density and the coupling constant .",
    "the large initial energy density and small coupling constant case is related to the small initial energy density and large coupling constant case via the @xmath39 scaling .",
    "the elastic only curves in panel ( b ) and panel ( c ) follow this @xmath39 scaling and are identical for these two cases .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that evolutions with and without radiative processes have different dependences on system parameters . in the case with radiative processes ,",
    "when the energy density is increased , the screening mass decreases , increasing the cross section and collision rate .",
    "however , this is counteracted by the additional particle production .",
    "as the system falls far below chemical equilibrium , additional particle production tends to increase the screening mass and reduce the collision rate . lacking this balancing factor ,",
    "the elastic only case can not maintain approximately the same evolution as with the lower energy density case and the pressure anisotropy increases drastically .",
    "decreasing the coupling constant can compensate for the increase in pressure anisotropy caused by the energy density increase . as the initial binary collision cross section is proportional to @xmath39 with fixed initial number density , when the coupling constant is decreased by the same factor as the energy density increase",
    ", there is an exact @xmath39 scaling in the elastic only case .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the approximate @xmath12 scaling in the radiative case .",

    "the two data sets with different initial pressure anisotropies but otherwise same parameters seem to converge toward a common final evolution .",
    "the difference between these two data sets can be used to study the rate of convergence as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dplopt ] for cases including the @xmath0 processes .",
    "the difference quickly decreases and at late times fits well with an exponential decrease with proper time . in the case with @xmath1 only , the two curves may cross each other at late times ( see e.g. panel ( d ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : plopt1 ] ) . in any case , by 2 fm/@xmath3 , the differences all go to about or below 1% of the initial difference .",
    "the system approaches the asymptotic evolution on a very short time scale .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : dplopt ] shows that the approach to asymptotic evolution is faster with higher initial energy density or higher coupling constant .",
    "it is interesting to notice that within error bars , these lines seem to go through the same point .",
    "we also looked at the curves with only elastic processes .",
    "they also seem to go through a common point , even though that point is different from the one with inelastic processes .     for initial space - time rapidity density @xmath41 and coupling constant @xmath32 .",

    "when the temperature @xmath17 is taken to be the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom , i.e. , @xmath43 , the resultant @xmath44 leads to the expression @xmath45 . for systems in thermodynamical equilibrium , i.e. , in chemical and thermal equilibrium , @xmath46",
    "the comparison of fugacity evolutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmbd1 ] demonstrates the interplay between thermal equilibration and chemical equilibration .",
    "transverse initial conditions have evolutions lower than their isotropic initial condition counterparts mainly because of their slower early energy density evolutions caused by the inside - outside space - momentum correlation .",
    "when only @xmath1 is included , the system falls farther and farther away from chemical equilibrium .",
    "as the @xmath0 processes are turned on , the system is able to approach chemical equilibrium . even for transverse initial conditions with @xmath5 gev/@xmath6 where",
    "there is a decrease in fugacity mainly due to longitudinal expansion , at late times , the fugacity is able to reach a value that is comparable to other cases . note that",
    "in this case , there are more annihilations than productions initially even when @xmath47 because of the transverse spatial distribution .",
    "this is why the early evolution is slightly lower than the corresponding elastic only case .",
    "it demonstrates that chemical equilibration depends on kinetic equilibration in the radiative case . for various cases with the @xmath0 processes , the final fugacities at 2 fm/@xmath3",
    "are all on the 80% to 90% level .",
    "note that the @xmath5 gev/@xmath6 case has an initial fugacity close to @xmath10 , while the @xmath9 gev/@xmath6 case is significantly undersaturated initially . as discussed before ,",
    "this difference in initial fugacities is behind the observed different energy dependences of pressure anisotropy evolutions for the elastic only and the radiative cases .",

    "when radiative processes are included , there is an approximate @xmath12 scaling that is in contrast with the @xmath39 scaling seen when only elastic processes are included .",
    "evolutions with different initial pressure anisotropies appear to approach the same asymptotic evolution exponentially at late times .",
    "if a partonic system is initially close to chemical equilibrium , radiative processes can significantly enhance pressure isotropization . for systems",
    "significantly undersaturated at the initial time , evolutions with and without radiative processes can be close to each other .",

    "the dependence on the initial momentum distribution can be studied by comparing the results with those that start with initial momentum distributions motivated by the color glass condensate .",

    "when inelastic processes are included , there is not much change in the pressure anisotropy evolution . in other words ,",
