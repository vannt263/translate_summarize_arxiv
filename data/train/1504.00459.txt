    "the schwinger effect@xcite is a pair creation process in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , due to an external electric field gauge field .",
    "furthermore , it may be generalized to non - abelian gauge fields like color fields in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . ] .",
    "the production rate ( per unit time and volume ) is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are an electron mass , an elementary electric charge and an external electric field , respectively .",
    "this formula is computed under the weak electric - field ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a typical value of @xmath2 for which the schwinger effect becomes significant is estimated as @xmath4 thus @xmath5 is extremely large in comparison to typical values of electric field in table - top experiments .",
    "for example , a typical value of electric field necessary to ionize an atom is given by @xmath6 with the fine - structure constant @xmath7 .",
    "at least so far , in real experiments , the schwinger effect has not been observed yet , but it may be observed in the near future . the xfel project at desy and the eli project in europe plan to produce extremely strong electric field very close to @xmath5 .",
    "the exponential factor in the production rate indicates that the pair production process should be described as a non - perturbative phenomenon like a tunneling process in quantum mechanics . to make a virtual pair of electron and positron be real particles",
    ", it is necessary to achieve larger energy than the static energy from an external source . a phenomenological potential",
    ", @xmath8 leads us to a tunneling picture .",
    "the potential @xmath9 is composed of three parts : 1 ) the static electron mass , 2 ) the coulomb potential with the distance @xmath10 between electron and positron , and 3 ) an energy provided by the external electric field @xmath2 .",
    "for the detail , see e.g.  chapter 13 in the book@xcite .",
    "the potential shapes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ tunnel : fig ] .",
    "when @xmath2 is not so large , one can see the potential barrier ( the blue line in fig .",
    "[ tunnel : fig ] ) .",
    "but the particle can penetrate it quantum mechanically , the particle creation can be described as a tunneling phenomenon .",
    "this is nothing but the schwinger effect .",
    "it would be worth estimating the production rate roughly in the wkb sense .",
    "the triangle approximation of the potential barrier leads to the following exponential factor , @xmath11 this is very close to schwinger s result ( [ srate ] ) , despite the rough estimation .",
    "( critical electric field ) . for the green line ,",
    "the vacuum is catastrophically unstable . ]    as @xmath2 increases , the barrier tends to be lowered and at last it disappears completely at a certain value of @xmath2 ( the red line in fig.[tunnel : fig ] ) .",
    "this value is referred to as the critical electric field @xmath12 .",
    "the disappearance of the barrier indicates that the qed vacuum becomes unstable catastrophically once @xmath2 has reached @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to evaluate this value as @xmath13 note that this value is far beyond the weak - field approximation @xmath3 .",
    "hence , frankly speaking , it has not been clarified whether the catastrophic decay would really occur or not .",
    "an intriguing question to be answered is `` does the catastrophic vacuum decay in qed really occur ? ''",
    "although we have discussed the schwinger effect in qed so far , let us change the direction a little here and focus upon a critical behavior in string theory .",
    "it is well known that there exists an upper critical value of electric field in the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "this bound obeys from a self - consistency condition of string theory . on the other hand , we know intimate relations between string theories and gauge theories .",
    "for example , these are established through the ads / cft duality @xcite . according to this duality , a string theory on an anti - de sitter ( ads ) space",
    "is equivalent to a conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the most well - studied example is the duality between type iib string theory on @xmath14 and the @xmath15 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) with an @xmath16 gauge group in four dimensions .",
    "thus , one may expect a connection of electric fields between the string theory and gauge theory sides through the ads / cft duality .",
    "then the result in the string - theory side suggests that the catastrophic vacuum decay can really occur at least in a class of gauge theories which have gravity duals .",
    "thus , to investigate the possibility of the catastrophic vacuum decay in gauge theories much deeper beyond the weak - field approximation , it would be worth studying the schwinger effect in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "another motivation is to argue the schwinger effect in qcd",
    ". it may give rise to a new mechanism of a confinement / deconfinement phase transition and it would have a connection with the rhic and lhc experiments , where strong electro - magnetic fields and color fields are induced due to the collision of heavy ions .",
    "it motivates us to study the schwinger effect in confining gauge theories .",
    "however , it is not easy to tackle this issue with the standard method in quantum field theories . a nice way is to employ a holographic computation by realizing confining gauge theories with appropriate d - brane set - ups .",
    "in fact , we have considered the schwinger effect in confining gauge theories along this line @xcite .",
    "the potential analysis @xcite has been done for general confining backgrounds @xcite by generalizing the procedure in the coulomb phase@xcite .",
    "the production rate has been evaluated numerically in the case of a confining d3-brane background @xcite ( which is an example of ads solitons @xcite ) .",
    "the organization of this review is as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a short review of the world - line instanton method based on articles@xcite .",
    "this is a method to calculate the production rate and becomes a key ingredient in preparing a holographic computation in the subsequent sections . in section 3 , we consider the schwinger effect in the @xmath15 sym .",
    "this system is conformal and contains no fundamental matter field .",
    "hence , naively , the schwinger effect can not be argued . a possible way of overcoming these points is to employ the higgs mechanism .",
    "we first compute the production rate in the higgsed @xmath15 sym naively by using the world - line instanton method .",
    "after all , this computation leads to a puzzle on the critical value of external electric field .",
    "then , to resolve this puzzle , an improved holographic set - up is presented by following the seminal work by semenoff and zarembo @xcite .",
    "the production rate is reconsidered along this line and the puzzle is certainly resolved .",
    "section 4 is the main part of this article based on a series of our works @xcite and investigates the schwinger effect in a confining gauge theory by employing a confining d3-brane background @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature is that there is another kind of critical value of electric field due to the existence of the confining phase .",
    "we have evaluated the production rate numerically and computed new exponents associated with the critical electric fields .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "in this section , we will give a short review of the world - line instanton method by following the works@xcite .",
    "there are various methods to calculate the pair production rate of the schwinger effect in qed .",
    "we shall introduce here one of them , called the world - line instanton method .",
    "an advantage of this method is that one can easily add a contribution coming from the coulomb potential . in particular , it enables us to compute the production rate at arbitrary coupling . in the following",
    ", we will explain first the computation at weak coupling , then the one at arbitrary coupling .    as a simple example , let us first consider a massive scalar qed .",
    "the action for a massive scalar qed ( in the euclidean signature ) is @xmath17 with the covariant derivative , @xmath18 note here that the vector field is divided into a dynamical ( fluctuating ) part @xmath19 and an external part @xmath20 .",
    "the path integration is performed only for the dynamical part , not for the external part .",
    "the production rate @xmath21 is given by the imaginary part of the vacuum energy density @xmath22 , @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the volume of the four dimensional space . by performing the path integral for the scalar field @xmath25 ,",
    "the following expression is obtained , @xmath26 in a small coupling region , the dynamical part of the vector field can be ignored .",
    "hence the expression ( [ rate1 ] ) is approximated as @xmath27 here we have used schwinger s parametrization @xmath28 and the quantum - mechanical path - integral representation .",
    "note that @xmath29 satisfies the periodic boundary condition @xmath30 .",
    "next , as for the expression , the @xmath31-integration is firstly performed , and then the integral for @xmath32 is done . for later convenience ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath33 this condition will be identified with the weak - field condition for the external electric field , as we will see later .",
    "it is worth noting that the integration about @xmath31 can be regarded as a modified bessel function , @xmath34 and its asymptotic behavior for large @xmath10 is @xmath35 then , under the condition ( [ weak ] ) , the expression is simplified as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined as @xmath39 the above computation is identical with the method of steepest descent for the @xmath31-integration .",
    "but , note that the condition is not necessary if we do not want to use the asymptotic form of the bessel function at this stage .",
    "the path integral about @xmath32 is evaluated by the method of steepest descent .",
    "the equation of motion obtained from @xmath40 is @xmath41 multiplying by @xmath42 and integrating it , we find the following relation , @xmath43    let us suppose a constant electric field is turned on the @xmath44-direction . then the vector potential is taken as @xmath45 the other components are set to be zero .",
    "note that the imaginary unit @xmath46 appears because we are now working in the euclidean signature .    with the constant electric field ,",
    "the classical solutions are represented by @xmath47 the periodic boundary condition @xmath48 determines @xmath49 like @xmath50 thus the classical motion has been completely fixed .",
    "this solution is often called `` instanton , '' just because this is a classical solution in the euclidean signature .    with the relation , it is easy to check that the assumption is nothing but the weak - field condition @xmath51 as noted before .",
    "furthermore , the assumption is the same as the condition to ensure that the steepest - descent method is a good approximation .    by combining the classical action @xmath52 with one - loop prefactors ,",
    "the production rate is evaluated as @xmath53 the production rate is the same as the schwinger formula for the scalar qed .",
    "this expression is valid at small coupling and under the weak - field condition .",
    "the method presented here is applicable to a spinor qed as well @xcite .",
    "we have not explained the one - loop prefactor here . for the detail of the derivation , for example ,",
    "see the works @xcite .",
    "let us generalize the production rate at weak coupling to the one at arbitrary coupling , though we still suppose the weak - field condition .    before going to the detail",
    ", it is worth to see a heuristic argument based on the pair production rate of monopole and anti - monopole . in the georgi - glashow model , it is evaluated as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are an external magnetic field , a monopole mass and a magnetic charge , respectively .",
    "this result is valid under the following two conditions : @xmath58    let us perform electric - magnetic duality for the above result .",
    "the production rate is mapped to @xmath59 but the validity region is @xmath60 and the strong coupling region is supposed as opposed to the previous computation .",
    "this observation indicates the expression should be valid for arbitrary coupling .",
    "in fact , this expression can be obtained by a direct computation @xcite , as we will show below .    in the previous subsection",
    ", the coupling constant has been supposed to be so small that the dynamical field @xmath19 is ignorable .",
    "but we will take account of @xmath19 at finite coupling here .",
    "then the equation is replaced by @xmath61 \\right\\rangle\\ , , \\label{286}\\ ] ] where the expectation value is defined as @xmath62 furthermore , the equation can be approximated as @xmath63 under the weak - field condition .",
    "this can be regarded as an electron loop expansion in the feynman diagrams .    here",
    "we keep the diagrams with a single electron loop and drop off the higher - loop contributions .",
    "this selection is a good approximation when the external field is weak enough . by doing the same calculation as in the previous subsection",
    ", the production rate is obtained as @xmath64 in comparison to , the expression includes the contribution coming from the coulomb interaction .",
    "this modification is reflected as a @xmath65 wilson loop in .    under the condition ,",
    "the integration about @xmath31 leads to @xmath66 where we have employed the following identity : @xmath67 the derivation of is straightforward .",
    "let us next perform the path - integral about @xmath32 .",
    "the coulomb interaction should change classical solutions , as a matter of course .",
    "however , note here that the coulomb interaction term is invariant under a scale transformation and a rotation in the plane on which the instanton is rotating . hence it does not depend on the size of the classical solutions .",
    "thus the classical solutions are not changed when the wilson loop is added as a perturbation .",
    "the classical action is modified as @xmath68 here we have used the formula @xmath69 where an unphysical divergence has been ignored .",
    "recall that the contributions of the coulomb interaction are small .",
    "then the prefactor of the exponential has not been modified . as a result",
    ", the production rate is given by @xmath70 thus we have reproduced the conjectured form ( [ conjecture ] ) as the @xmath71 case .    note",
    "that the production rate is not exponentially suppressed any more just after @xmath2 has reached the critical value @xmath72 that is , the vacuum becomes unstable catastrophically above this critical value .",
    "however , the weak - field condition @xmath73 is broken as follows : @xmath74 hence it is not certain whether the catastrophic vacuum decay really occurs or not .",
    "it is significant to answer this question .",
    "a possible way is to follow a holographic computation , as we will introduce in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will consider the schwinger effect in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "there are many variations of ads / cft , but we will concentrate on the most typical example , the duality between type iib superstring on @xmath14 and the @xmath15 @xmath16 sym in four dimensions . however , in order to argue the schwinger effect , there are three obstacles :    1 .",
    "the @xmath15 @xmath16 sym is conformal ( i.e. , all of the fields are massless ) .",
    "all of the matter fields belong to the adjoint representation .",
    "3 .   there is no @xmath65 gauge field .    as for ( 3 ) ,",
    "as a matter of course , one may consider non - abelian schwinger effects .",
    "but it is not so easy to study the issue itself .",
    "hence it is better to focus upon an abelian schwinger effect as a first trial .",
    "let us first introduce a @xmath65 gauge field and fundamental matter fields by employing the higgs mechanism",
    ". then one can compute the pair production rate of the fundamental matter fields by following the procedure introduced in sec .  2 .",
    "however , we will encounter a puzzle for the critical value of electric field . to resolve it , semenoff and",
    "zarembo proposed a prescription @xcite and presented an improved holographic set - up .",
    "subsection 3.2 will introduce their proposal .",
    "we start from the @xmath75=4 @xmath76 sym theory .",
    "it consists of a gauge field @xmath77 , six real scalar fields @xmath78 and four weyl fermions @xmath79 , the hat is attached for later convenience .",
    "all of the fields belong to an adjoint representation of @xmath76 .",
    "one should notice here that the @xmath80 sym includes neither a @xmath65 gauge field and nor fundamental matters .",
    "then , by breaking @xmath76 to @xmath81 with the higgs mechanism , let us introduce a @xmath65 gauge field .",
    "the @xmath76 fields are decomposed into the @xmath16 part , the @xmath65 part and non - diagonal parts : @xmath82 here @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath85 $ ] are the @xmath86 $ ] gauge , the scalar and the fermionic fields , respectively . the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar fields is supposed to be @xmath87 in terms of d - branes , the higgs mechanism corresponds to separating a single d3-brane from the remaining stuck of @xmath88 parallel d3-branes .",
    "the distance between the separated d3-brane and the @xmath88 d3-branes is related to the vev of the scalar fields .    as a result ,",
    "the @xmath75=4 @xmath76 sym action @xmath89 is decomposed like @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the action for the w - boson supermultiplet @xmath92\\ , .",
    "\\label{w - mul}\\ ] ] for our purpose , we will concentrate on the complex scalar fields @xmath93 ( called `` quarks '' ) and drop off the vector field @xmath94 and the fermionic field @xmath95 in the w - boson supermultiplet .",
    "the higher order interactions are also ignored .",
    "a remarkable point is that the covariant derivative @xmath96 in ( [ w - mul ] ) is given by @xmath97 thus the scalar fields in the w - boson supermultiplet have a finite mass @xmath98 and couple to the @xmath65 gauge field @xmath99 as well as the @xmath16 gauge field @xmath100 .",
    "note here that five scalar fields are massive but one scalar field is massless . for example , let us consider the case with @xmath101 . for @xmath102 ,",
    "mass terms exist in the action , but for @xmath103 it vanishes .",
    "the massless field is absorbed into the vector field @xmath104 as the longitudinal mode so that @xmath104 becomes massive .",
    "let us calculate the pair production rate , @xmath105 and @xmath95 have the same mass .",
    "hence @xmath93 , @xmath105 and @xmath95 may be produced equally .",
    "in fact , the exponential factor does not depend on spins , though the prefactors are different .",
    "in addition , as for @xmath104 , there is another kind of problem called the nielsen - olsen instability .",
    "when @xmath105 pairs are created under external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "see the work @xcite for the detail of this instability in the holographic schwinger effect . ] for @xmath93 by using the world - line instanton method . in the following ,",
    "we take the t  hooft limit @xcite where @xmath106 with @xmath107 fixed .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is also supposed to be sufficiently large so as to suppress the dynamical part of the @xmath65 gauge field .",
    "then @xmath99 can be regarded as an external field like @xmath109 note that we work in the euclidean signature to calculate the production rate .",

    "it may seem that the critical electric field satisfies the weak - field condition because @xmath108 is supposed to be very large .",
    "however , it would be unlikely that heavy particles are produced due to the schwinger effect because such a process is severely suppressed",

    "the set - up is the following .",
    "a single d3-brane is separated from the stuck of @xmath88 parallel d3-branes .",
    "the near - horizon limit of the stuck of @xmath88 d3-branes is represented by the @xmath123 geometry : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the curvature radius .",

    "the horizon of ads is located at @xmath129 and the conformal boundary is at @xmath130 .",
    "the separated d3-brane can be treated as a probe brane in the bulk ads .",
    "a remarkable point is that the probe d3-brane is put at an intermediate position ( @xmath131 ) between the horizon and the boundary , and it sits at a point on @xmath132 . for the configuration ,",
    "[ configuration : fig ] .",
    "according to the set - up , the mass of a single quark is not infinite any more but finite .",
    "the quark mass is measured by the energy of a string stretched from the probe d3-brane to the horizon like @xmath133 here @xmath134 is the string tension .",
    "inspiring from the fact that a circular wilson loop appears in the production rate , semenoff and zarembo proposed a new scenario that the production rate may be computed by a circular wilson loop on the probe d3-brane equipped with a constant electric @xmath55-field .",
    "the vev of the wilson loop can be evaluated by the area of a minimal surface of the fundamental string attaching to the boundary loop .",
    "that is , the exponential factor in the production rate is estimated as @xmath135 here @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the nambu - goto ( ng ) action and the coupling to an ns - ns 2-form . in the euclidean signature ,",

    "so far , we have studied a holographic description of the schwinger effect in the coulomb phase .",
    "an interesting direction is to consider the schwinger effect in the confining phase by generalizing the previous set - up .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of the schwinger effect in a confining gauge theory by employing a holographic approach@xcite .",
    "it would be important to motivate the readers to study the schwinger effect in the confining phase , before going to the detail .",
    "recently , qcd in strong external fields has been intensively studied to explain experimental data of rhic and lhc . in these experiments , a extremely strong magnetic field",
    "is induced , because colliding nuclei have large electric charge and move very fast .",
    "this strong magnetic field may have a visible effect on the nuclear dynamics .",
    "apart from the magnetic field , a strong electric field is also created around the nuclei as well as a strong color field .",
    "thus , to capture the underlying physics concerned with the experiments , it is inevitable to study the qcd dynamics in the presence of strong external fields . as a matter of course ,",
    "the schwinger effect in the confining phase is included in this direction .",
    "we will utilize a holographic approach to study the schwinger effect , but one may wonder whether the lattice formulation would be enough to study it . in the presence of an external electric field , one encounter a notorious sign problem and",
    "hence it is quite difficult to use the lattice formulation in general .",
    "some researchers may hesitate to borrow a holographic computation .",
    "but one can not disguise the fact that there is no definite method to tackle this issue instead of it , at least so far",
    ". it would be quite useful to capture qualitative pictures of the schwinger effect in the confining phase even by employing the ads / cft .",
    "in fact , one can see quantitative predictions as well as qualitative understanding by pursuing this direction .",
    "first of all , let us introduce the set - up to study the schwinger effect in the confining phase .",
    "for this purpose , the bulk ads@xmath167 has to be replaced with another confining background with a dimensionful parameter",
    ". there are lots of backgrounds dual to confining gauge theories .",
    "a simple example is an ads@xmath167 soliton background ( often called a confining d3-brane background ) soliton background for simplicity , but it would be easy to generalize the present analysis to the other confining backgrounds by following the work@xcite . ] .",
    "the metric of the ads@xmath167 soliton background is given by @xmath168 + l^2 { { \\rm d}}\\omega _ { 5}^2\\ , , \\notag \\\\",
    "&    f(z)=1-\\left ( \\frac{z}{z_{\\rm t}}\\right)^{4}\\ , . \\label{metric } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the radial direction is described by @xmath169 and a scalar function @xmath170 contains a constant parameter @xmath171 .",
    "then the geometry is cut off at @xmath172 and the conformal boundary is at @xmath173 .",
    "the parameter @xmath171 has the dimension of length and the inverse has the dimension of energy .",
    "hence @xmath174 gives rise to the confining string tension on the dual gauge - theory side .",
    "as @xmath175 , @xmath176 and the usual ads@xmath167 geometry is reproduced .    as another point ,",
    "the @xmath177-direction is compactified on a circle @xmath178 with the radius @xmath179 .",
    "hence the limit @xmath175 corresponds to the decompatification limit @xmath180 .",
    "anyway , the dual gauge theory lives on @xmath181 rather than @xmath182 .",
    "thus the dual gauge theory can not be regarded as the usual confining gauge theory in @xmath183 dimensions .",
    "still , however , it would be possible to extract qualitative behaviors by examining the ads@xmath167 soliton background .",
    "the results obtained here would be a key ingredient towards the study in the real qcd .",
    "let us first study the schwinger effect in the confining phase from the viewpoint of potential analysis .",
    "naively , the schwinger effect could be argued with the modified potential @xmath184 here the modification is that a confining potential with the string tension @xmath185 is added as well as the usual potential analysis .",
    "an important observation is that the string tension @xmath186 and the electric field @xmath2 compete with each other .",
    "when @xmath187 , the potential diverges as @xmath188 and hence the schwinger effect would not occur . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath189 , the situation is not so different from the coulomb phase and the qualitative behavior would be almost the same as the previous .    in the holographic set - up , it is necessary to evaluate the vev of a rectangular wilson loop for the quark anti - quark potential .",
    "it can be computed with the minimal surface of a string attaching to the loop on the probe d3-brane embedded in the @xmath190 soliton background .    in this subsection",
    ", we will work with @xmath191 as the radial coordinate , following the notation of our article@xcite .",
    "hereafter , we move to the euclidean signature . the probe d3-brane is supposed to be at @xmath131 .",
    "we impose the following ansatz for the rectangular wilson loop ( see fig . [ ads - soliton : fig ] ) : @xmath192 the ng part of the string action is @xmath193 since the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath153 explicitly , the hamiltonian @xmath194 is conserved .",
    "when we impose the boundary condition at the tip of the minimal surface like @xmath195 the conserved quantity becomes @xmath196        by rewriting the conserved quantity , we obtain @xmath197 by integrating the expression , the distance between a quark and an anti - quark , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath198 where we have defined dimensionless quantities as @xmath199 the sum of the potential energy and static energy is evaluated as @xmath200 here @xmath10 is a function of @xmath49 , and hence the potential is a function of @xmath10 thorough @xmath49 .    for large @xmath10 limit ( i.e. @xmath201 limit ) , the sum of the potential energy and static energy behaves as @xmath202 the first term is the quark and anti - quark potential with a confining string tension @xmath203 and the second term is static mass of quark and anti - quark @xmath204    by including the energy coming from the external electric field , the total potential is rewritten into an integral representation , @xmath205 where we have introduced a dimensionless electric field @xmath206 @xmath207 @xmath12 is the critical electric field obtained from the dbi action . in the following ,",
    "we define a dimensionless electric field @xmath206 normalized by @xmath12 .",
    "the total potential is plotted in fig.[d3-plots : fig ] as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ d3-plots : fig ] shows the existence of two critical electric fields .",
    "the first one is @xmath208 and the second is @xmath209 when the electric field is smaller than the confining string tension , the pair production is prohibited because the potential does not dump at infinity . when the electric field is larger than it , it is allowed as a tunneling process .",
    "thus , at the first critical electric field , a confinement / deconfinement transition starts . as a side remark ,",
    "a similar behavior of the phenomenological potential in a confining theory has been argued by using a lattice formulation @xcite .     and @xmath210 .",
    "the blue line is for @xmath211 .",
    "there is no zero other than the origin and hence the schwinger effect does not occur .",
    "the red line is for @xmath212 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath213 and the potential becomes flat as @xmath214 . for the values of @xmath206 between @xmath215 and @xmath216 ,",
    "the potential barrier is formed and the schwinger effect can occur as a tunneling process .",
    "when @xmath217 ( the orange line ) , the barrier just vanishes and the system becomes unstable catastrophically . ]",
    "the second critical electric field is the same as the critical electric field obtained in the coulomb phase .",
    "that is , the vacuum becomes unstable catastrophically above this value of the electric field .",
    "note that this qualitative behavior can also be understood analytically .",
    "for the detail , see the works @xcite .    here",
    "we are mainly concerned with the long - distance behavior of the potential .",
    "but it would be worth commenting on the short - distance behavior . as shown in fig.[d3-plots : fig ] , the potential becomes zero at the origin , in comparison to the usual potential analysis .",
    "this is just because the coulomb potential is modified on the probe d3-brane sitting at an intermediate position in the bulk .",
    "the modified coulomb potential was originally argued by kabat and lifschytz @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we will compute the production rate numerically and examine two critical electric fields .",
    "both of the resulting critical values agree with the ones obtained in the potential analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will introduce new exponents associated with the critical behaviors and evaluate the numerical values .    to compute the production rate",
    ", one has to evaluate the vev of a circular wilson loop on the probe d3-brane",
    ". then the d3-brane is placed at an intermediate position between @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the first is to construct a classical string solution attaching to the circular wilson loop .",
    "let us suppose the following ansatz : @xmath218 the other components are set to be zero .",
    "suppose that the world - sheet coordinates @xmath219 are restricted to the following range : @xmath220 then boundary conditions for @xmath221 and @xmath222 are imposed like @xmath223 the configuration is depicted in fig.[config - circle : fig ] .",
    "in addition , a constant field @xmath224 is set to be @xmath225 this @xmath224 field induces an external electric field on the probe d3-brane .",
    "then the resulting ng action and the coupling to @xmath224 are given by , respectively , @xmath226 here we take that @xmath227 with a diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath10 .    .",
    "then the equation of motion for @xmath228 is obtained as @xmath229 in the presence of the @xmath224 field , the boundary condition on the probe d3-brane becomes the mixed boundary condition : @xmath230 here @xmath206 is a dimensionless electric field defined in ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to solve analytically the differential equation ( [ eom.z ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ mixed ] ) .",
    "hence let us solve it numerically and study the behavior of @xmath228 . as a result",
    ", we will show the existence of two critical electric fields and the consistency of the values with the ones obtained from the potential analysis in subsec .",
    "hereafter , we take that @xmath231 to validate the holographic description ( i.e. , large @xmath108 ) .    for some values of @xmath232 ,",
    "numerical results are shown in fig.[rate : fig ] .",
    "the left figure shows exponential suppression factors , and the right one is plots of the classical action .",
    "typically , the suppression factors tend to vanish below certain values of @xmath206 ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) , depending on values of @xmath232 .",
    "this is the same @xmath2-dependence as in the coulomb phase . in the case of the confining phase",
    ", one can see a new behavior that the classical action diverges ( i.e. the exponential factor vanishes ) at the value @xmath233 .",
