    "dynamic wetting encompasses a class of interfacial phenomena relevant to technical applications in strategic areas ranging from materials science to energy research .",
    "critical applications such as coating , self - assembly , and microfluidic handling have motivated extensive efforts toward developing models for the dynamic wetting of solid surfaces .",
    "nonetheless , physical understanding and successful mathematical modeling of these phenomena still requires significant developments @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description of dynamic wetting must account for the coupling between molecular and hydrodynamic interactions taking place on length and time scales that extend over several orders of magnitude .",
    "classical continuum - level descriptions rely on the navier - stokes equations for the mathematical modeling of hydrodynamics , while microscopic interactions need to be coarse grained in order to render hydrodynamic boundary conditions at fluid - solid or fluid - fluid interfaces . in order to model the physical coupling between microscopic interactions and hydrodynamics , boundary conditions for the wall velocity and the static / dynamic contact",
    "angles commonly take the form of algebraic equations @xcite or even partial differential equations @xcite . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "these boundary conditions are not just input parameter values , but rather involve additional model equations .",
    "furthermore , the set of hydrodynamic equations must usually be supplemented with equations of state ( eos ) and other constitutive relations that can make a continuum - level description cumbersome .",
    "this type of classical continuum description , although widely employed , suffers from several limitations in dealing with nontrivial microscopic effects .",
    "in particular , the sharp - interface limit leads to well - known mathematical singularities and paradoxes ; e.g. logarithmic stress singularities , the moving contact line paradox @xcite .",
    "such unphysical artifacts are readily removed @xcite by considering that fluid - fluid and fluid - solid interfaces are actually `` diffuse '' and thus have a finite thickness , determined by thermal diffusion and the range of action of molecular forces .",
    "the interface thickness can be considered as a cutoff length @xcite , or characteristic microscopic scale of the physical system , below which the classical continuum model with a sharp interface is not valid .",
    "a fundamental phenomenon observed at the microscopic scales is the presence of thin interfacial films ( e.g. precursor films on hydrophilic surfaces @xcite ) within which dispersion forces ( e.g. london  van der waals forces ) become significant .",
    "the mass and momentum fluxes through these interfacial films can produce nontrivial effects on the hydrodynamic behavior ( e.g. effective slip velocity @xcite ) and the equilibrium conditions prevailing in the fluid bulk @xcite .",
    "it becomes therefore necessary to refine the level of modeling within the interfacial films in order to model dynamic wetting phenomena in many systems of practical interest ( e.g. micro / nanoflows , colloids ) . in this work ,",
    "we propose a so - called `` mesoscopic '' model @xcite embodying an augmented description of the solid - fluid interface .",
    "such a mesoscopic approach , based on the single - particle distribution , is convenient for modeling the net effects of microscopic interaction forces on the dynamics of macroscopic quantities ( e.g. mass density , thermodynamic pressure , and fluid momenta ) .",
    "this strategy can be realized by using mean - field interaction potentials , or pseudo - potentials , that are scalar functions of macroscopic quantities ( e.g. mass density ) . similarly to effective interaction potentials used in different forms of dlvo theory @xcite ,",
    "pseudo - potentials are scaled by interaction parameters ( e.g. attraction / repulsion hamaker constants ) .",
    "these interaction parameters determine an interfacial force per unit area , or disjoining pressure @xcite , that can have both repulsive and attractive components varying as a function of the distance from the interface .",
    "the disjoining pressure near the solid - fluid interface ultimately determines the contact angle at the apparent three - phase contact line @xcite .",
    "hence , the set of attraction / repulsion parameters employed determines implicitly the wetting properties of the solid . moreover , the attractive - repulsive character of the modeled interactions can lead to multiple local minima and maxima in the disjoining pressure .",
    "these physical features give rise to nontrivial effects , such as the static hysteresis of the apparent contact angle on a ( macroscopically ) smooth surface @xcite .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate our mesoscopic model motivated by the physical insights presented above ; the current implementation of this model is based on the numerical solution of a lattice boltzmann ( lb ) equation .",
    "a fundamental difference with previous lb models lies in the augmented treatment of the solid - fluid interface by means of a wall probability function and a pseudo - potential for solid - fluid interactions having two adjustable parameters that control the magnitude of attractive and repulsive interfacial forces .",
    "the two - parameter model allows us to simulate surfaces that exhibit the same static properties , i.e. same static contact angles , yet different dynamic behavior , i.e. different static or dynamic contact angle hystereses . in sec .",
    "iii we report numerical results for pressure - driven flows of a volatile fluid .",

    "physical and conceptual issues remain in the modeling of hydrodynamic boundary conditions for moving contact lines [ see @xcite for a discussion ] .",
    "furthermore , there is some experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence that dynamic contact angles can not be solely a function of the contact line speed and the physical properties of the system .",
    "a mesoscopic model does not require prescribing hydrodynamic boundary conditions nor the value of dynamic contact angles and , thus constitutes an interesting alternative to study dynamic wetting phenomena .",
    "furthermore , conditions within the solid phase are dynamically computed with the proposed mesoscopic model and one does not need to prescribe any variables at the fluid - solid interface ( e.g. pseudo - potential value , gradient of an order parameter ) , as it is customary for other lb models @xcite .",
    "we have presented a mesoscopic model , based on a statistical description of the microscopic physics , that is capable of simulating nontrivial macroscopic phenomena observed during dynamic wetting of solids when hydrodynamic effects play a critical role .",
    "similarly to previous models based on the lattice boltzmann method @xcite , long - range microscopic interactions are modeled via mean - field potentials ( i.e. pseudo - potentials ) that are explicit functions of macroscopic variables .",
    "the most distinct feature of this model is that the solid phase is treated on a similar footing as the fluid phase .",
    "short - range fluid - solid interactions are modeled by a solid probability function @xmath88 , defining the probability of fluid - solid collisions , while long - range fluid - solid interactions are determined by pseudo - potentials designed to produce a disjoining pressure with the proper functional form . hence , the modeled surface forces have essential features required to mimic physical effects observed during both full and partial wetting of solids .",
    "regarding these fundamental effects we remark the following .",
    "( 1 ) the effective slip velocity , determined by momentum fluxes across the surface film , can widely vary on surfaces that exhibit the same equilibrium contact angle ( i.e. surfaces with similar chemical properties ) .",
    "( 2 ) the magnitude of the hydrodynamic slip can significantly vary across macroscopic scales ; the slip velocity increases near a moving contact line , while no slip is approximately recovered far from it .",
    "( 3 ) precursor films develop on hydrophilic surfaces and their evolution is dictated by the eos of the fluid and surface forces ; for the simulated system a small fraction of vapor is adsorbed on the solid substrate underneath the film .",
    "( 4 ) a finite hysteresis of the static contact angle is observed for partially wettable and macroscopically smooth surfaces ; the magnitude of this hysteresis is determined by the modeled shape of the disjoining pressure .",
    "( 5 ) the flow kinematics near advancing and receding contact lines can exhibit substantial differences ; rolling motion is favored near the receding contact line , while corner flow easily develops near the advancing contact line . the ability of the model we presented to reproduce these physical phenomena is crucial for studying diverse problems involving partial wetting and hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "there are several limitations inherent in the lb implementation that originate with the discretization of phase space . as a consequence , the method is stable and robust within a range of moderate density and viscosity ratios between the vapor and liquid phases , while it is difficult to realize large surface tensions ( i.e. above one in lattice units ) .",
    "the study of many systems of interest can be accomplished by carefully matching the most relevant dimensionless groups in the problem of interest ( e.g. capillary number , bond number , ohnesorge number ) .",
    "however , modeling of systems with large density ratios ( e.g. water - air ) in general flow conditions remains a challenging task and requires further developments of lb and other mesoscopic methods .",
    "an interesting possibility is to implement a mesoscopic approach at the same level of modeling by employing a particle - based method ; this could potentially extend the range of physical parameters where the numerical method is stable at the expense of certain computational advantages in the lattice discretization .",
    "we should remark that the proposed approach aims to reproduce the proper macroscopic physics in the fluid bulk .",
    "the purpose of our mesoscopic description is to dynamically couple surface forces and hydrodynamics , circumventing the use of complex boundary conditions for macroscopic variables .",
    "the interfacial film thickness in the proposed model is arbitrarily prescribed by placing a minimal number of simulation nodes ( i.e. one lattice cell ) required to resolve the interfacial region [ see appendix ] .",
    "the most attractive property of our approach lies in the fact that the chemical physics and hydrodynamics , fully coupled in the mesoscopic model , arise as different aspects of the simulated dynamics of a single - particle distribution .",
    "this level of description has the potential of guiding the study of complex phenomena in contact line motion .",
    "such phenomena could include the finite time for formation and relaxation of the solid - fluid interface , and fluid compressibility effects .",
    "the application of this model to study deformable solids is of particular interest ; there , @xmath88 becomes time dependent .",
    "other interesting applications include the dynamic wetting of micro - structured surfaces , and the extension of the proposed model to multi - component systems ( e.g. colloidal suspensions , complex fluids ) .",
    "the authors are pleased to acknowledge m. sbragaglia , x. shan , s. succi , and s. sundaresan for valuable comments and stimulating discussions throughout the progress of this work .",
    "the work has been partially supported by the u.s department of energy through grant de - fg02 - 09er25877 ( cec and igk ) and by the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7 / 2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement no [ 240710 ] ( mek and agp )",
    "all fluid - solid interactions are determined by the spatially - varying functions ( @xmath88 , @xmath74 , and @xmath91 ) shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : solidwall ] , which must be defined before the dynamic simulation starts . in principle",
    ", the three functions can be any integrable function with a finite value in the solid bulk and null value within the fluid bulk .",
    "the spatial variation of these functions determines the magnitude of the surface forces ( i.e. disjoining pressure ) and momentum fluxes in the dynamic simulation .",
    "the wall function @xmath83 introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq : wall_shift ] controls the momentum exchange at the fluid - solid interface and thus the effective slip velocity dynamically attained above the interfacial film .",
    "a finite value of the local wall probability ( @xmath84 ) can be interpreted as the presence of microscopic - scale imperfections ( or sub - nanometer scale roughness ) on the solid surface ; the product @xmath160 represents the local probability of a collisional event ( short - range repulsion ) between solid and fluid molecules .",
    "the repulsive component , @xmath74 , and attractive component , @xmath91 , of the fluid - solid pseudo - potential , @xmath72 , give rise to a disjoining pressure with both repulsive and attractive parts ; this property is crucial to model partially wettable surfaces @xcite .",
    "the conditions described above could be easily satisfied by simple analytical expressions in the case of flat surfaces , as we studied in this work . however , it is convenient to have a general numerical procedure to deal with complex surface geometries . for that purpose",
    "we employ a recursive gaussian filter @xmath161 the initial wall probability @xmath162 is a heaviside step function that takes the unit value , @xmath163 , in the region @xmath164 containing the solid nodes and takes the zero value outside this region , @xmath165 . in our simulations",
    "the outer boundary of the domain @xmath166 belongs to the solid bulk , in this region the value of the wall probability must always be unit @xmath167 . accordingly , the smoothed wall function @xmath168 is reset to unity on the outer boundary nodes @xmath166 after each iteration in eq .",
