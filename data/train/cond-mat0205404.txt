    "it is often useful to characterize critical systems by their geometric properties , for example the distribution of cluster sizes which appears to follow a power law @xmath5 asymptotically for large @xmath6 , where @xmath7 gives the number of clusters of @xmath6 connected sites , per lattice site .",
    "the exponent @xmath8 is a universal quantity whose value is the same for all systems of a given class  for example , @xmath9 for all critical percolation systems in two dimensions , no matter what lattice or percolation type is considered as long as the rules are sufficiently local .",
    "the coefficient or amplitude @xmath10 however is non - universal , varying from lattice to lattice .    indeed",
    ", @xmath7 can not have a completely universal form because it is written in terms of a lattice - level measure , the mass @xmath6 .",
    "different lattice structures have different typical site densities at the lattice level and correspondingly different values of @xmath10 . in order to characterize the size distribution of clusters in a way that circumvents the site - level description , the authors of ref.@xcite considered ( for the case of two - dimensional percolation ) the quantity nr@xmath11 which gives the number of clusters whose maximum @xmath12- or @xmath13- dimension @xmath14 is greater or equal to a given value @xmath15 , divided by the total system area , @xmath16 .",
    "they argued that for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing ) , this quantity should behave as @xmath19 with the coefficient @xmath20 being a universal quantity , identical for all 2d percolating system at the critical point .",
    "the universality of @xmath20 follows heuristically from the idea that @xmath21 represents a macroscopic measure of the large clusters of the system , and remains well defined in the limit @xmath22 , in which the lattice disappears .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath23 is a consequence of the self - similarity of the fractal percolating system , and can also be derived by the following argument ( in @xmath24 dimensions ) : from ( [ ns ] ) it follows that the number of clusters whose mass is greater than @xmath6 scales as @xmath25 , and because @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fractal dimension of the clusters , the number of clusters whose length scale is greater than @xmath15 scales as @xmath28 , or @xmath29 by virtue of the hyperscaling relation @xmath30 .",
    "this result is valid for any critical system where the hyperscaling relation is valid .",
    "later we shall give other , presumably equivalent , theoretical arguments .",
    "besides the maximum dimension @xmath14 , one can consider any other macroscopic measure of the length scale of the cluster , such as the radius of gyration or the diameter of the covering disk .",
    "for each measure , there is a corresponding value of @xmath20 .",
    "an equivalent way to write ( [ nl ] ) is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of clusters ( per unit area ) whose area ( by some measure ) is greater or equal to @xmath0 , and @xmath2 depends upon the choice of that measure",
    ". this could be the area of the smallest disk covering the cluster , the area enclosed by the cluster , and so on .",
    "( [ narea ] ) is the form of the size distribution that will be considered in this paper .",
    "we note that ( [ narea ] ) can also be written as @xcite @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represents a rank - ordering of the areas , such that @xmath36 is the area of the largest cluster , @xmath37 the area of the second - largest , etc .",
    ", for a system whose total area @xmath38 is defined as unity .",
    "although the rank - ordering necessarily starts with clusters whose area is of the order of the area of the system , the behavior of ( [ zipf ] ) applies to clusters whose area is much smaller than @xmath39 but larger than the lattice element area .",
    "( [ zipf ] ) gives the size distribution in a proper zipfs - law form , in which the weight ( here area ) is inversely proportional to the rank .",
    "when written in terms of @xmath6 , on the other hand , the behavior of the size ranking is not a simple inverse power as above ( compare @xcite and @xcite ) and also is not universal .",
    "the various measures of the area of the clusters that were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite included the area of the square @xmath40 , the area of a disk that just covers the cluster , the area enclosed by the external perimeter ( hull ) of the cluster , and the area enclosed by the grossman - aharony ( g - a ) hull of the cluster ( in which fjords are excluded ) @xcite .",
    "( percolation hulls are fractal with dimension @xmath41 @xcite but enclose a non - fractal , euclidean area . ) for each of these measures , a different value of the constant @xmath2 applies , and the following values were found : @xmath2(square ) @xmath42 , @xmath2(disk ) @xmath43 , @xmath2(g - a hull ) @xmath44 , and @xmath2(hull ) @xmath45 .",
    "the way these different values of @xmath2 were found was that the first @xmath2(square ) was measured directly on a fully populated lattice ( since the measurement of the maximum @xmath12- or @xmath13-direction is an easy task ) , and then the rest were deduced ( in an approximate way ) by looking at the ratio of the area measures for individually generated clusters .",
    "it was noticed that @xmath2(disk ) is close to the fractal co - dimension @xmath46 , but no exact results for any of these @xmath2 were obtained .    in the present paper",
    "we report on a direct numerical and theoretical study of the constant @xmath47(hull ) for the 2d measure of the area enclosed by the external perimeter or hull of percolation clusters , ising spin clusters , and fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters on the potts model clusters for @xmath48 , 3 and 4 .",
    "( of course , percolation corresponds to the potts model for @xmath49 and the ising model corresponds to @xmath4 . )",
    "initially , one of us predicted that for percolation @xmath50 independently , the other numerically determined @xmath51 , which is completely consistent with this prediction .",
    "additional work described below yields @xmath52 ( one standard deviation of error ) .",
    "this close agreement confirms that the coulomb gas methods that are used to derive these results are most certainly applicable to percolation and the potts model .",
    "we also considered different lattices and types of percolation to demonstrate universality .    for ising clusters of same - spin sites",
    ", we predict the value @xmath53 exactly half the value for percolation clusters . for the potts model with @xmath54",
    ", we also consider the areas enclosed by the fk bond clusters @xcite , and find for the corresponding values of @xmath2 : @xmath55    the theoretical justifications of the above predictions are based upon considerations reported previously in @xcite and expanded upon in the second section below . in the third section",
    "we describe the numerical work we carried out to test these results ; we find good numerical confirmation for all the cases .",
    "conclusions are given in the fourth section .",
    "in this section we compute the universal amplitude @xmath2 in the scaling law @xmath56 , using coulomb gas methods @xcite .",
    "these are not rigorous , but are known to give presumably exact results for critical exponents and other universal quantities .",
    "while the development in the introduction emphasizes clusters and the areas enclosed by their external hulls , the focus will shift to both external and internal hulls , or loops when both are taken together .",
    "a factor of one - half will be included in the final results to compensate for this change , so that the values for @xmath2 will be applicable to just external hulls , just internal hulls , or the average ( but not sum ) of the two .",
    "we consider a finite but large system of linear size @xmath57 , and total area @xmath16 . as will become clear ,",
    "the precise geometry and boundary conditions are not relevant to the calculation of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath57 is considered to have dimensions of length , so that the total number of sites in the lattice is of order @xmath58 , where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing .",
    "all the models we consider ( percolation , ising spin clusters , fk clusters ) are special cases of either the o@xmath59 model or the @xmath60-state potts model @xcite .    the o@xmath59 model is most easily considered on a honeycomb lattice , and it is equivalent to the loop gas model defined by the partition function @xmath61 where the sum is over all configurations of non - intersecting closed loops on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this model has in general two critical points for each @xmath62 in the interval @xmath63 $ ] : @xmath64 ( dilute phase ) and @xmath65 ( dense phase ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 the loops form the hulls of site percolation clusters on the triangular lattice ; for @xmath66 and @xmath68 they are the boundaries of critical ising clusters .",
    "for @xmath69 we get a single self - avoiding loop , and for @xmath70 the loops are the steps on a surface at the roughening transition .",
    "the partition function of the @xmath60-state potts model is more easily considered on the square lattice , and it may be transformed into that of the random cluster model , proportional to @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the hulls of the clusters form closed loops on the medial lattice , a square lattice whose vertices lie at the midpoint of the links of the original lattice . at the critical point @xmath73 , @xmath74 is proportional to the partition function of a loop gas @xmath75 note that both internal and external cluster hulls are counted as loops .    in both cases ,",
    "then , the critical models are equivalent to loop gases with fugacity @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath76 ) per loop .",
    "the hulls of the fk clusters are in the same universality class as the dense phase of the o@xmath59 model with @xmath77 .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , we are interested in the number @xmath32 of such loops , per unit area of the lattice , whose internal area is greater than a given @xmath0 .",
    "note that we consider @xmath0 as having dimensions ( length)@xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    ", we expect that @xmath32 has a finite limit as @xmath80 . in order to obtain universal results",
    ", we also consider @xmath81 .",
    "our computation of the form of @xmath32 in this regime is in two stages : first we show , from coulomb gas arguments , that the total area contained in _ all _ loops behaves logarithmically , @xmath82 , as @xmath83 , with a calculable coefficient ; then we argue from this that in the regime of interest @xmath56 , with @xmath2 simply related to the above coefficient . _ _",
    "we shall present two _ a priori _ independent arguments , both however based on coulomb gas methods , for evaluating the leading behavior of the the total area in side all loops in large but finite system . _ _      the argument of this section follows that of refs .",
    "@xcite , but , in order to be self - contained , we present it again , perhaps with greater clarity .",
    "the loop gases described above may be mapped exactly onto a height model on the dual lattice , as follows .",
    "each loop is assigned a random orientation , so that a configuration of @xmath84 unoriented loops corresponds to @xmath85 configurations of oriented loops .",
    "there is a 1 - 1 mapping between the configurations of this oriented loop gas and the heights @xmath86 , conventionally chosen to be integer multiples of @xmath87 , as follows : assign @xmath88 on the boundary , and increase ( decrease ) @xmath86 by @xmath87 each time a loop is crossed which goes to the left ( right ) .",
    "the fact that the loops are closed makes this a consistent procedure .",
    "the weights of @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath76 ) associated with each loop may be taken into account in the ensemble of oriented loops in ( at least ) two ways : the most natural would be to assign equal weights @xmath89 to each orientation : we refer to this as the _ real _ ensemble , and denote averages with respect to this ensemble with conventional brackets @xmath90 .",
    "however , these weights have the considerable disadvantage of not being local when expressed in terms of the height variables . instead , for calculational purposes , a different weighting is usually chosen , in which the phases @xmath91 are distributed along each loop by assigning a phase @xmath92 each time the loop turns leftwards through an angle @xmath93 .",
    "each anticlockwise ( clockwise ) loop thus accumulates a total phase @xmath94 ( resp .",
    "@xmath95 ) . on summing over orientations , these account for the loop weights as long as @xmath96",
    "clearly , these weights can not now be interpreted as probabilities , and we refer to this as the _ complex _ ensemble . averages with respect to this will be denoted by @xmath97 $ ] . _",
    "_ _ _    within each ensemble , we may view each oriented loop as carrying a unit current in the sense of its orientation .",
    "let @xmath98 be the corresponding current _",
    "density__. for example , for a current directed along a link in the positive @xmath13-direction , located at @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . this current density may be used to give a formula for the area of a single closed loop : @xmath102 this formula is valid for any non - self - intersecting loop , and is independent of its orientation .",
    "if however we now consider the same quantity evaluated for a given configuration of a gas of many loops , and we sum over the orientation of each loop independently , @xmath103 will average to zero if @xmath104 and @xmath105 are on different loops .",
    "thus the expression @xmath106 where @xmath90 denotes the average over the loop gas ensemble , gives the mean total area @xmath107 inside _ all _ loops .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    what is the current density @xmath108 in the height model parametrization of the configurations ?",
    "let us imagine that the definition of the height function @xmath109 is extended to @xmath110 in such a way that it is constant within each plaquette .",
    "an obvious candidate is then @xmath111 . within the real ensemble ,",
    "this is clearly correct .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath112 on summing over orientations of a given loop which passes through @xmath104 .",

    "the constant @xmath123 is fixed by requiring that , for a fixed long loop whose sides at @xmath12 and @xmath124 are parallel to the @xmath13-axis , after summing over orientations , @xmath125 .",
    "the factor @xmath62 arises from the sum over loop orientations in the height model .",
    "this gives @xmath126 so that @xmath127 . _ _",
    "all of this is exact , on the lattice .",
    "the weights in the height model are local but complicated , involving as they do the phase factors @xmath128 .",
    "the central assumption of the coulomb gas approach is that , for the purposes of studying the long - distance behavior of correlation functions , they may be replaced by the continuum measure @xmath129 , with @xmath130 .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 may be determined by a number of methods @xcite to give @xmath132 , so that @xmath133 .",

    "this form of the 2-point correlation function of a conserved current is in fact dictated by rotational invariance , but it is the coefficient @xmath145 which is the main result : written in terms of @xmath131 it is @xmath146    substituting this result into ( [ intjj ] ) , we notice that the result would appear to diverge logarithmically at @xmath147 .",
    "however , this is an artifact of the continuum approximation : the result ( [ jjk ] ) is valid only for separations @xmath148 .",
    "since the potential divergence is logarithmic , the amplitude of the leading term is insensitive to the precise nature of the modification at shorter distances , and therefore we may impose a simple cut - off @xmath149 on the integral . similarly , the precise form ( [ jjk ] ) becomes invalid for separations @xmath150 , but the short - distance leading logarithm @xmath151 must always appear in the form @xmath152 , on dimensional grounds , independent of the precise geometry .",
    "thus the mean total area within all loops behaves as @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the total area of the system .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in any simply connected region @xmath155 the right - hand side of ( [ atot ] ) is proportional to @xmath156 , where the @xmath157 are the eigenvalues of @xmath158 in @xmath155 , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the leading term always has the universal logarithmic behavior shown above . up to a non - universal constant which may be absorbed into the cut - off @xmath18 , the @xmath159 remainder is universal and depends only on the shape of @xmath155 .",
    "for example , for a rectangle it is related to modular forms .      in this section",
    "we show how the leading behavior of @xmath160 may also be found using methods of conformal field theory on a cylinder , as an extension of the results of ref .",
    "let us define , for a given configuration of unoriented loops , the ` depth ' @xmath161 of a given site on the dual lattice to be the minimum number of loops which must be crossed to connect @xmath104 to the boundary .",
    "that is , it is the number of noncontractible loops surrounding @xmath104 . in the height description , it is the supremum of @xmath162 over all possible orientations of the given set of loops . as with @xmath109 , we may extend the domain of definition of @xmath161 to the continuum plane by assuming that it is constant over each plaquette of the dual lattice .",
    "then a little thought shows that the total area within all loops is simply @xmath163 so that we need to evaluate @xmath164 .",
    "we do this by first evaluating @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the minimal number of loops which separate distinct points @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the infinite plane . by translational invariance",
    "this is a function of @xmath167 only .",
    "let us conformally map the plane into a cylinder of perimeter @xmath168 via the usual mapping @xmath169 .",
    "as @xmath170 the images of these points are far apart along the cylinder , and @xmath166 is therefore asymptotically the same as the number of loops which wrap around the cylinder between these points .",
    "> from the point of view of the height model with complex weights , these loops must in any case be treated separately , since the factors of @xmath171 all cancel , so that each orientation is , a priori , counted with weight 1 . as is well known , this may be compensated for by inserting operators @xmath172 at opposite ends of the cylinder .",
    "the free energy per unit length then is @xmath173 , where @xmath174 .",
    "the first term comes from the casimir effect of the fluctuations of the @xmath86-field , while the second is the correction due to the flux between the charges at either end .",
    "this then gives the correct result for the central charge @xmath175 .",
    "let us now count the loops which wind around the cylinder with a weight @xmath176 , instead of weight @xmath177 .",
    "the free energy per unit length will be simply modified by an additional term @xmath178 the mean number of loops which wrap around the cylinder , per unit length , is then found by taking @xmath179 of this expression and setting @xmath180 . transforming back to the plane ,",
    "@xmath165 is given by this same coefficient , multiplying @xmath181 .",
    "after a little algebra we then find @xmath182 where @xmath145 is given by eq .",
    "( [ kn ] ) . the logarithmic dependence of this function also follows from the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , who derived that dependence from general scaling arguments but did not find the coefficient given above .",
    "this result , of course , applies to the number of loops separating @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the infinite plane .",
    "however , notice that it has a logarithmically divergent dependence on @xmath18 , which comes from loops which are much smaller in size than @xmath183 .",
    "this same divergence should arise if we now consider the number of loops separating a given point @xmath104 from the boundary in a large but finite system , for all points whose distance from the boundary is much larger than @xmath18 ( but still much less than @xmath57 ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath184 where the last statement holds because @xmath57 is the only dimensionful parameter available to compensate @xmath18 .",
    "this gives a second derivation of eq .",
    "( [ atot ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath185 , in the height representation .",
    "the fact that this behaves logarithmically with @xmath183 is consistent with the hypothesis that , in the continuum limit , the heights are distributed according to a gaussian ensemble @xmath186 in the _ real _ ensemble , even though the lattice weights are nonlocal .",
    "however , this hypothesis is incorrect : as may be shown by extending the above calculation on the cylinder to higher moments , the cumulant @xmath187 and does not vanish as it would in a gaussian ensemble .",
    "however , note that this cumulant decays faster than each term on the left hand side , so that asymptotically the distribution of @xmath161 is normal , as was proved by kesten and zhang @xcite . _ _      in this section we first show how the logarithmic behavior of @xmath107 provides further justification for the assertion that @xmath189 for @xmath190 , then show how to relate the coefficients .",
    "recall that @xmath32 is the number of loops with area greater than @xmath0 , divided by the total area of the system . for @xmath191 ,",
    "this will also depend on @xmath57 , so let us write it as @xmath192 . on dimensional grounds it has the form @xmath193 where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing . for @xmath190 , we expect it to be independent of @xmath57 , but , a priori , it could depend on @xmath18 . in this regime , let us suppose it has the form @xmath194 where @xmath2 is a constant and @xmath195 is some exponent .",
    "this is not of course the most general dependence which is possible , but is that which would arise if , for some reason , the area scaled non - trivially with @xmath18 , that is , had a fractal structure .",
    "such dependence , with @xmath196 , would for example occur in the distribution of masses , rather than of areas , of percolation clusters .",
    "the form ( [ form ] ) should of course connect smoothly onto the behavior for @xmath197 , when we expect that @xmath198 , and @xmath191 , where @xmath199 .",
    "now the total area @xmath200 within all loops is related to @xmath201 by @xmath202 comparing with ( [ atot ] ) , we see that the contribution to the sum from the region @xmath203 will exceed @xmath204 if @xmath205 , and similarly",
    "the contribution from @xmath206 will violate this bound if @xmath207 .",
    "therefore @xmath208 , and @xmath209 for @xmath190 .",
    "admittedly , this argument assumes the _ ansatz _ ( [ form ] ) , and the reader may be more comfortable with the hyperscaling argument put forward in the introduction .",

    "in the same way , percolation hulls can be generated individually on a blank ( undetermined ) lattice by a kind of growing self - avoiding walk that mimics the walk used to trace out hulls @xcite . for critical bond percolation @xcite ,",
    "the walker moves along the edges of a square lattice ( the diagonals in fig .",

    "the walk terminates when it returns to the origin and can not proceed further .",
    "note that pseudo - random numbers are generated only for the bonds that are visited during the walk , making this method efficient .",
    "this walk has also been studied as a kinetic lorentz - gas model @xcite , and the results here apply to that model also .    in order for the contribution of a given hull to be the same as on the fully populated lattice , it is necessary to weight each walk by @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the number of hull steps .",
    "this compensates for the fact that a hull of @xmath225 steps is generated with @xmath225 times the probability in the single cluster method compared to the population method , because there are @xmath225 places a given walk can start from .",

    "to study the clusters of the ising model , we considered a square lattice of size @xmath239 with periodic b.c . , and simulated the system at the critical temperature of @xmath288 ( where @xmath289 is the coupling constant in the potts model formulation , @xmath290 ) using the wolff variation @xcite of the swendsen - wang method @xcite .",
    "we initialized the lattice with 1000 updates , and then measured the hull area distribution treating the system exactly as if it were one of site percolation , using the same definition of hull areas as shown in fig .  2 and indeed the same algorithm .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that we have to cross one half as many cluster hulls to reach the boundary in the ising case .",
