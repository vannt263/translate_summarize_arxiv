    "the increasing importance of coherent phonon spectroscopy in material science is related to the growing problem of heat dissipation in modern nanoscale devices .",
    "this problem is impossible to solve without detailed understanding of underlaying phonon - phonon and phonon - electron interactions on the nanoscale .",
    "one of the methods to study this processes is coherent phonon spectroscopy , in which a particular phonon spectrum is excited coherently in the sample and detected optically .",
    "research efforts in this direction resulted in significant progress in generation and detection of coherent phonons in various materials .",
    "the available phonon frequency has reached the thz acoustic limit @xcite and basically the whole phonon frequency range nowadays could be excited coherently . however , convenient optical detection methods based on raman@xcite or brillouin@xcite scattering allow for the observation of phonons excited only in the vicinity of the brillouin zone center .",
    "therefore , sub - thz acoustic phonons could be accessed optically only in multilayer structures , in which the acoustic dispersion branch backfolds many times inside a mini - brillouin zone of a multilayer @xcite .",
    "modern progress in pulsed laser techniques as well as in multilayer fabrication has lead to a set of successful experiments in which the coherent zone - folded superlattice phonons have been optically excited and detected @xcite .",
    "however , these optical methods are insensitive to the thz frequency phonons which have propagated into the bulk of the crystal due to the unfolding of the phonon dispersion curve .",
    "convenient optical methods based on brillouin scattering in this case have a detection limit in the 100ghz range given by the wave vector magnitude of the optical light @xcite . recently ,",
    "ultrafast x - ray diffraction ( uxrd ) has become available to extend the accessible phonon frequency range to above 100ghz .",
    "it has been used successfully to study both the time - domain structure of optically excited zone - folded coherent acoustic phonons in epitaxial multilayers@xcite as well as to observe the propagation of unfolded phonons into the bulk @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report our new uxrd experiments from coherent quasi - monochromatic longitudinal acoustic phonons in srtio@xmath0 synthesized by fs - laser excitation of srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( sro / sto ) epitaxial multilayers .",
    "using uxrd we determine the laser excited phonon spectrum in srtio@xmath0 and monitor the modification of the spectrum in the time domain .",
    "the epitaxial multilayers were prepared using pulsed laser deposition @xcite .",
    "the experiments are carried out at the bessy edr beamline using a unique setup for a 1mhz repetition rate uxrd experiments .",
    "the experiments are done in a traditional scheme which uses an optical delay line to change the time interval between the optical pump and the x - ray probe pulses .",
    "we use infrared optical pulses with the wavelength of 1.03@xmath3 m for pumping and 8kev x - rays for probing the lattice dynamics .",
    "the important feature of this setup is the simultaneous acquisition of the x - ray photons scattered from the sample before and after the pumping optical pulse .",
    "this makes the x - ray intensity difference signal sensitive only to those changes in the crystal lattice which were exclusively initiated by the optical pulses . for a further details we refer to a recent publication describing the setup@xcite",
    "recent studies showed that the optical excitation of a metal transducer by a sequence of ultrashort laser pulses is an efficient method to generate sub - thz quasi - monochromatic longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons @xcite .",
    "in essence , the repetitive generation of bipolar strain pulses by the laser - excited transducer @xcite forms a phonon wavepacket of narrow spectral bandwidth propagating throughout the substrate . in this report",
    "we consider a different approach which uses a spatial repetition instead of a temporal one , i.e. , the excitation of a periodic metal - dielectric multilayer ( superlattice ) with a single ultrashort laser pulse ( see fig .  [ phononsimulations](a ) ) .    /srtio@xmath0",

    "( c ) calculated spectrum of the strain pulse in the wave vector and frequency domains induced by the optical excitation .",
    "the vertical scale stands for the excitation fluence of 6mj/@xmath4 used in the experiment . ]",
    "this way the so - called superlattice phonon mode is excited @xcite which subsequently unfolds into the substrate thereby forming la phonon wavepackets with similarly narrow spectral bandwidth @xcite . in most cases the laser - induced coherent lattice dynamics may be calculated using either a model of a continuous elastic medium @xcite or a linear - chain model ( lcm ) of masses and springs @xcite . here",
    "we employ the latter approach which will be more appropriate for short - period superlattices and automatically accounts for the acoustic phonon dispersion .",
    "the details of the numerical model can be found in ref .  .",
    "the excellent agreement of such a linear - chain model with related optical and uxrd experiments has been previously demonstrated for various sample structures @xcite .",
    "further we consider linear chain calculations for a five - period sro / sto multilayer with the spatial period @xmath5 nm which is schematically shown in fig .  [ phononsimulations](a ) .",
    "the structural parameters of the sample which are determined by static high - resolution x - ray diffraction ( hrxrd ) @xcite are collected in table  [ sampleparameterstable ] .",
    "in addition , the longitudinal sound velocities of the individual materials are shown@xcite .",
    "the results of the linear - chain calculations using the parameters given in table  [ sampleparameterstable ] and the experimental pump fluence of 6  mj/@xmath4 are shown in the figs .",
    "[ phononsimulations](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the graph in fig .",
    "[ phononsimulations](b ) shows the calculated one - dimensional strain profile in the sample 250  ps after the excitation .",
    "figure  [ phononsimulations](c ) plots the spectral amplitude of the linear - chain eigenvectors ( normal modes ) as a function of the eigenfrequency .",
    "this amplitude spectrum is solely determined by the initial conditions @xcite . for the bulk sto substrate",
    "the eigenvectors are plane elastic waves with wave vector @xmath2 satisfying the well - known dispersion relation of acoustic phonons @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ phononsimulations](b ) illustrates , the optical excitation of the metal layers of the multilayer system results in the generation of a coherent strain wavepacket propagating into the sto substrate at the longitudinal sound velocity @xcite .",
    "the resulting wavepacket inside the sto substrate attains the particular shape shown in fig .",
    "[ phononsimulations](b ) , namely , five leading compression pulses and five trailing expansion pulses which are separated by @xmath6 nm , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the metal / dielectric multilayer acts as the photoacoustic transducer synthesizing the coherent la phonon wavepacket in the sto substrate .",
    "the sharp static profile of the thermal strain inside the multilayer ( see fig .  [ phononsimulations](b ) ) remains unchanged with time because the linear chain model neglects the effect of heat diffusion .",
    "the heat diffusion in multilayers is a complicated separate topic which lays out of the scope of this article . in this article we focus on the coherent lattice dynamics in the sto substrate which occur at a later timescale when the effect of heat diffusion within the multilayer does not play a role . for the detailed description of the wavepacket strain profile and its generation we refer to our earlier works @xcite .",
    ".structural and mechanical properties employed in the calculations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    there are two major reasons for the observed decrease of the uxrd peak intensities . first , the absorption of the x - rays by the crystal reduce the sensitivity of the x - rays to the wavepacket as it propagates deeper into the substrate .",
    "second , the dissipation of energy from the elastic wave due to the finite phonon lifetimes leads to a decay of the strain amplitude .    considering the first reason , the decay time of the uxrd signal exclusively due to x - ray absorption is related to the x - ray absorption coefficient @xmath7 by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the longitudinal sound speed in the substrate@xcite .",
    "the relative variation of the x - ray scattering vector @xmath10 during the presented uxrd experiments is @xmath11 which implies that @xmath12 is virtually independent of the observed phonon wavevectors @xmath2 . in the measured off - bragg region",
    "the x - ray extinction due to dynamical x - ray diffraction is negligible , therefore only the angular independent x - ray absorption is relevant . under the chosen experimental conditions we estimate a signal decay time of @xmath13  ps due to the x - ray absorption . nevertheless , since this value is critical for the correct interpretation of the experimental data , we have performed dynamical xrd calculations based on results of the linear - chain lattice dynamics in harmonic approximation which excludes the effect of phonon damping@xcite .",
    "the simulations yield the @xmath2-independent value of 450@xmath145ps for the decay constant due to x - ray absorption which we will use in the following .    regarding the second reason for the decay of the uxrd phonon signals , we assume an exponential law for the decrease of the phonon population @xmath15 and define the associated decay time @xmath16 . according to ( [ amplitudefromintensity ] ) the corresponding intensity of the scattered x - rays possesses the same decay constant .",
    "therefore , the uxrd signal decay mechanisms introduce the relationship between the phonon lifetimes @xmath16 , x - ray absorption time constant @xmath12 and the experimentally measured time constant @xmath17 : @xmath18    the phonon lifetimes @xmath16 extracted from the uxrd experiments according to ( [ decaytimesrelationship ] ) are given in the table  ( [ table ] ) for the wave vector magnitudes corresponding to the first and second order phonon peaks .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath19 for the phonon lifetimes are calculated from the standard deviations @xmath20 of the experimental time constants according to the error propagation relation .",
    "the important observation is the fact that the determined lifetimes differ by a factor of approx .",
    "4 whereas the related phonon wave vector differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "in addition to the signal decay we see a gradual drift of the phonon peak position to higher values of @xmath2 as the wavepacket propagates .",
    "this is seen from the fig .",
    "[ phononpeakshift](a ) in which the phonon spectrum is shown for different time delays .    in the following section we discuss the physical interpretation of the described observations .",
    "the central observation from the transient phonon - induced diffraction peaks presented in the previous section is the apparent quadratic decrease of the phonon lifetime with phonon wave vector @xmath2 .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the @xmath21 law predicted by the akhiezer s sound attenuation mechanism @xcite .",
    "there are basically two theories which explain the attenuation of a hypersonic waves in dielectric crystals due to incoherent anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "these are the landau - rumer theory @xcite and the akhiezer theory @xcite which have different application limits : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular frequency of the hypersonic wave and @xmath24 is the mean thermal phonon relaxation time .",
    "that is , in both cases the elastic energy of hypersound waves decreases with time due to the interaction with incoherent thermal phonons .",
    "the mean thermal phonon relaxation time @xmath24 can be estimated from the thermal conductivity @xmath25 , heat capacity @xmath26 , average sound speed @xmath27 and mass density @xmath28 by the relation @xcite @xmath29 for sto at room temperature ( [ thermalconduct ] ) yields @xmath30  ps . the experiments are performed at room temperature .",
    "more precisely , the sample persisted at around 400k during the actual measurements due to the thermal load from the laser@xcite . condition ( [ akhiezer ] ) is fulfilled for this temperature range .",
    "that is , for the presented experiments akhiezer s theory of relaxation damping could be applied , hereby explaining the observed ratio of the phonon lifetimes for the first and second - order phonon diffraction peaks .",
    "however the uxrd data exhibit additional features which can not be explained within akhiezer s sound attenuation model .",
    "we extracted the transient peak positions by gaussian fits to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ phononpeakshift](a ) and the results are plotted as symbols in fig .",
    "[ phononpeakshift](b ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate linear fits to the phonon peak positions as a function of time .",
    "clearly , a gradual shift of the first and second - order spectral components to higher @xmath2-values can be observed as the phonon wavepacket propagates deeper into the sto substrate .",
    "a recent study revealed the nonlinear propagation of large - amplitude sound wavepackets in sto at room temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition to the akhiezer - like attenuation of the coherent la phonons the authors observed transient changes of the acoustic spectrum due to coherent anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering within the wavepacket .",
    "the lattice anharmonicity gave rise to a strain - dependent longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "in particular , the sound velocity of compressive ( tensile ) parts of the wavepacket was found to increase ( decrease ) with the strain amplitude .",
    "this effect led to an anomalous dispersion of the wavepacket and the corresponding modification the phonon spectrum .",
    "accordingly , we expect the first compressive half of the wavepacket shown in fig .",
    "[ phononsimulations](b ) to propagate faster than the second tensile half .",
    "moreover , the individual pulses inside the respective parts also exhibit different velocities due to the exponential amplitude distribution determined by the optical penetration of the pump light in sro .",
    "for both the compressive and tensile parts of the strain pulse the spatial separation @xmath31 of the individual pulses of the wavepacket is reduced as it propagates , i. e. the wavelength of both sub - packets is decreased .",
    "this explains the observed shift of the phonon peaks to larger @xmath2-values .    the presented uxrd data thus evidence the influence of two different effects on the propagation of la phonon wavepackets generated by periodic multilayers",
    "first , the inevitable attenuation of the wavepackets by akhiezer s relaxation damping and , second , the change of spatial and spectral shape of the wavepacket by nonlinear sound propagation .",
    "both effects influence the observed phonon lifetime , however , for a quantitative determination of the respective contributions additional measurements have to be performed .",
    "the results of our earlier all - optical experiments having much stronger excitation were successfully explained solely in the framework of nonlinear acoustics@xcite .",
    "we believe that at the presented experimental conditions the influences of both damping mechanisms the non - linear acoustic propagation and the akhiezer s relaxation are comparable .    uxrd has the advantage of measuring the lattice dynamics directly and quantitatively , i.e. the absolute amplitude of the lattice motion is determined .",
    "the wavevector range over which acoustic phonons in bulk material are accessible is very large . in particular resolving the second order phonon peak as presented in this paper or higher orders",
    "is possible .",
    "the extension of the uxrd detection of acoustic phonons in amorphous materials is challenging the available x - ray fluence , since the bragg spots are dispersed in diffraction rings .    on the other hand",
    "all - optical picosecond acoustics @xcite , in principle , do not require crystalline materials and for transparent media , the propagation of strain pulses can be monitored over longer distances . with current technology femtosecond time resolution",
    "is standard in all - optical experiments , while it is still a challenge in x - ray technology , which essentially resolved by free - electron lasers .",
    "high time - resolution permits the determination of the wave vector dependent sound velocity in addition to the damping time .",
    "we believe that the uxrd - based methods and the all - optical methods do not compete with each other but complete each other , together providing a more complete picture of the complex coherent phonon dynamics for a broader range of frequencies and wavevectors and for a broader class of materials and experimental conditions .",
    "this report presents ultrafast x - ray diffraction ( uxrd ) studies on laser - excited periodic srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 multilayers which are epitaxially grown on a srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "the ultrafast heating of the metallic srruo@xmath0 layers by ultrashort laser pulses generates coherent longitudinal acoustic phonons which eventually propagate into the substrate as a quasi - monochromatic coherent la phonon wavepacket at hypersonic frequencies .",
    "we discussed the properties of such wavepackets in detail and derive equations which show that uxrd is a powerful tool to measure the spectral phonon population and its dynamics . the presented uxrd data evidence the formation of quasi - monochromatic coherent phonon wavepacket .",
    "we extract the phonon lifetimes of the first and second - order peaks of the phonon spectrum .",
    "the observed quadratic decrease of the phonon lifetime with increasing phonon wavevector @xmath2 is in accordance with akhiezer s mechanism of relaxation damping .",
    "shifts of the peaks corresponding to the excited phonons to larger q - values are interpreted as a modification of the spatial shape profile due to the non - linear wave propagation leading to a strain dependent sound velocity .",
    "this considerably modifies the observed phonon lifetimes .",
    "in essence , uxrd provides a detailed and direct view on the complex nonlinear evolution of phonon - wavepackets , including incoherent damping of the phonon amplitude by coupling to other modes and specific coherent changes of the wavevector spectrum .",
