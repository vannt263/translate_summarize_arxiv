    "the peer - review process is the _ de facto _ standard for validating the written results of researchers within the scientific community . in its present form ,",
    "the peer - review process is mediated by journal editors and/or conference organizers .",
    "they receive manuscripts from authors , identify competent referees to review the manuscripts , and ultimately accept or reject each manuscript for publication or presentation on the basis of referee feedback . in the chain leading from a manuscript s submission to an editor",
    "s decision , the identification of competent referees constitutes a crucial first step ; it will shape the quality and reliability of the subsequent reviewing .",
    "referee identification has mainly been a human - driven process ; editors and conference organizers rely on their subjective assessments of a particular domain and the submission s content to identify a set of appropriate referees . however , it is not at all certain that editors have complete knowledge of all potentially competent referees for a particular manuscript , and , even if that were the case , that they are always able to produce an objective , good match between the manuscript and this pool of potential referees .",
    "research has in fact indicated the peer - review process is subject to numerous sources of biases and unreliability , many of which are undoubtedly caused by mismatches between a manuscript and its referees @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with the advent of open commentary peer - review systems for pre - print repositories @xcite such as naboj and web journals such as interjournal and philica , the requirements for an efficient peer - review process has changed . when any reader can submit a review , separating the ` wheat from the chaff ' becomes a high priority to validly assess the quality of a manuscript .",
    "locating referees to review a specific manuscript is thus gradually becoming less important as identifying which of the many provided reviews originate from actual experts in the manuscript s domain .",
    "a number of automated referee identification algorithms have been proposed in the literature to more objectively and efficiently match a submitted manuscript to a set of competent , i.e. , expert referees .",
    "previously published algorithms have mostly relied on matching referee - provided textual indicators of interest , e.g. key terms , to the contents of manuscripts .",
    "dumais et al ( 1992 ) and yarowsky et al ( 1999 ) @xcite use latent semantic indexing ( lsi ) to match manuscript abstract to referees .",
    "other approaches determine referee expertise via web mining techniques @xcite , and/or asking authors and the referees to provide keyterms describing their manuscript and area of expertise respectively @xcite .",
    "however , it is not feasible to require all individuals in the scientific community to report on their interest and expertise in this manner . nor is it feasible to perform latent semantic indexing on the websites and/or articles of all scientists in the community due to costs associated with text analysis on a large data set . applications of the mentioned referee identification algorithms have therefore been restricted to situations in which such information can be obtained for a pre - selected set of individuals , e.g. conferences and workshops .",
    "they have consequently failed to gain acceptance in the domain of classic journal peer - review and open commentary peer - review .",
    "this article proposes a referee identification algorithm that is both computationally inexpensive and requires no intervention on behalf of the authors , journal editors , and/or conference organizers .",
    "the proposed algorithm identifies appropriate referees for a manuscript by applying a particle - swarm algorithm to a co - authorship network .",
    "a particle - swarm is a discrete form of the spreading activation algorithm of information retrieval @xcite . in short",
    ", the proposed algorithm provides a context - specific weight for every individual represented in the co - authorship network , where the context is the paper required for review .",
    "the context - specific aspect of the algorithm places the algorithm into the class of relative rank algorithms ( i.e.  ranking with priors ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this context - sensitive weighting provides a strong incentive for its use in open commentary peer - review . to date",
    ", no such referee weighting algorithm has been proposed in the literature .",
    "the algorithm s performance is validated against referee bid data provided by the program chair and steering committee of the 2005 joint conference on digital libraries ( jcdl ) @xcite .",
    "we show how the algorithm can properly identify appropriate referees and , in some cases , conflicts of interests , and suggest how its accuracy can be improved by including additional data sources .",
    "the referee identification algorithm presented in this paper is dependent upon :    1 .   a co - authorship network data structure 2 .",
    "a relative - rank particle - swarm propagation algorithm    our approach is based on the premise that a manuscript s subject domain can be represented by the authors of its references .",
    "starting from those authors , we can identify related authors in a co - authorship network who may be potential referees for the submitted manuscript . to locate such related authors",
    ", a particle - swarm starting , from the referenced authors , diffuses an energy distribution over a co - authorship network in a manner similar to the spreading activation techniques used for information retrieval @xcite , but in a discrete form related to the random walker algorithms of markov chain analysis @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the iterative algorithms that identify a stationary distribution such as pagerank @xcite and eigenvector centrality @xcite , the proposed algorithm does not generate nor presuppose a particular network topology ( e.g.  aperiodic and connected ) .",
    "pagerank and eigenvector centrality algorithms are global rank metrics in that the initial distribution of energy in the network does not effect the final energy distribution when the algorithm has converged to a steady state vector . instead , the proposed algorithm is a relative rank algorithm in that the initial distribution of energy , or particles , in the network determines the final author ranking @xcite .",
    "the relative rank algorithm proposed in @xcite uses a  back probability \" to allow walkers to  teleport \" to their original source node . in this manner , a steady state vector is achieved that biases the final energy distribution in the network towards the source nodes .",
    "the relative rank algorithm in @xcite and @xcite maintains many similarities to the particle propagation algorithm proposed in this article . at the end of the particle propagation algorithm",
    ", the relative energy between authors represents the relative competency of each author represented in the co - authorship network with respects to the manuscript .",
    "this section will first discuss an algorithm to construct a co - authorship network from a digital library repository and will then provide a formal representation of the particle - swarm algorithm used to locate referees in the resulting co - authorship network .",
    "a co - authorship network is defined by a graph composed of nodes that represent authors and edges that represent a joint publication between two authors @xcite .",
    "therefore , a co - authorship network is represented by the tuple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes , one for each author , in the network , @xmath2 is the set of edges relating the various authors , and @xmath3 is the set of weights representing the strength of tie between any two collaborating authors . in other words ,",
    "any edge , @xmath4 , connects two authors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with a respective weight of @xmath7 .",
    "the edge weight between any two authors is determined by eq .",
    "[ eq : edgeweight ] .",
    "@xmath8    this equation represents two considerations .",
    "first , when the total number of authors for a manuscript , given by the function @xmath9 , is high , the resulting co - authorship weights will be low since the weight is distributed amongst the full of set of collaborating authors .",
    "this is represented by the fraction @xmath10 where @xmath9 returns the total number of authors for manuscript @xmath11 .",
    "second , the more frequently two authors co - author in the bibliographic record , the higher their co - authorship weight .",
    "the latter is represented by the summation , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the set of all manuscripts in a collection and @xmath14 .",
    "this method of co - authorship network construction is borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the co - authorship network construction algorithm runs in @xmath15 .",
    "the mentioned particle - swarm algorithm computed on the co - authorship network is a random process that requires the outgoing edge weights of a node to be represented as a probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the co - authorship edge weights must be normalized such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the set of outgoing edges from node @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of the particle - swarm algorithm is to map a manuscript to a set of potential referees .",
    "since a co - authorship network only expresses the relationship between authors , a manuscript will be represented as the set of authors in the manuscript s bibliography .",
    "let the set @xmath18 represent the set of authors cited in the bibliography of a particular article . for every author element @xmath19",

    "this means that at @xmath30 , only those author nodes that are references in the manuscript contain an energy value greater than @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , the more often a particular author is referenced by the manuscript , the more particles that author s node will initially receive at @xmath30 .",

    "int @xmath58 int @xmath59      there are three tunable parameters to the particle - swarm algorithm : the initial particle population @xmath60 , the decay parameter @xmath61 , and the number of steps for propagation @xmath38",
    ". the particle population can either be small in order to simulate a discrete random walker process or large to simulate a continuous spreading activation process .",
    "for the purpose of this study , we were more interested in the latter process .",
    "furthermore , by increasing the initial particle population size , the random effects of the stochastic particle propagation algorithm are reduced .",
    "our initial particle population for a single reference was @xmath62 particles .",
    "if an author is referenced more than once , then their initial particle population was @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of references to that author .",

    "thus , as @xmath57 , the effect of the particles on the final energy distribution diminishes to near @xmath32 . for this reason , we set @xmath38 to @xmath62 since at @xmath62 steps , the amount of energy in a particle is @xmath65 and thus nearly equivalent to an infinite @xmath38 .",

    "when bidding , the pc members can choose from the following bid codes :    1 : :    i am an expert in the domain of the submission and want to review 2 : :    i am an expert in the domain of the submission 3 : :    i am not an expert in the domain of the submission 4 : :    there exists a conflict of interest    the 2005 jcdl bid data provides a complete overview of which pc member actually volunteered to review which submissions . ideally , the algorithm s referee predictions for a particular manuscript should correspond with the 2005 jcdl pc members that volunteered to review the same manuscript .",
    "our evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed referee identification algorithm therefore rests on a comparison of the particle energy values a pc member receives and their actual bid codes .",
    "the algorithm requires a co - authorship network to generate sets of potential referees .",
    "the co - authorship network chosen for this experiment was constructed using the digital bibliography and library project ( dblp ) bibliographic dataset .",

    "[ 1.0 ]      this section will first discuss the general methodology of the algorithm validation and then provide the results of a comparison of the 2005 jcdl bid codes and the algorithms referee predictions for the 2005 jcdl submissions .",
    "the proposed referee identification algorithm can be said to produce valid results if its referee predictions match the actual 2005 jcdl pc bid codes .",
    "for example , a pc member who entered bid code 1 ( expert wanting to review ) for a particular manuscript should ideally receive a higher particle energy value than a pc member who entered bid code 3 ( not an expert ) .",
    "since this should be the case for all manuscripts , the overall effectiveness of the algorithm can be determined by summing the energy values of all pc members who entered a particular bid code and comparing the resulting total energy values across bid codes .",
    "this means that pc members whose bids indicate they are experts ( bid codes 1 and 2 ) should receive significantly higher energy values over all submissions than those whose bids indicated they are not experts ( 3 ) .",
    "if this is the case , it can be said the algorithm s particle energy values successfully predict which pc member should be refereeing a particular manuscript .",

    "it can be concluded from figures [ fig : coauthor - sum ] and [ fig : group - hist ] , that the ` black - out ' particle - swarm is able to remove a significant amount of energy from the conflict of interest referees .",
    "unfortunately , not all conflict of interest referee energy is reduced to zero .",
    "this may be because co - authorship relationships are not the only reason that conflict of interest situations emerge .",
    "we can only speculate that the incorporation of other relational information such as affiliation data , funding networks and institutional networks might provide the necessary network edges that will allow the ` black - out ' particle - swarm to remove more of the conflict of interest referees .",
    "one could also conceive of a situation in which the algorithm generates a set of potential referees which are then vetted by human operators on the basis of extraneous information to identify and exclude conflict of interest referees . in spite of its propensity to identify conflict of interest referees",
    ", such an application would nevertheless greatly improve the referee identification process .",
    "this idea will be left to future research in this area .",
    "it is important to further emphasize that this algorithm has only been validated on a co - authorship network that is focused on the computer sciences for which the digital library research agenda is a particular sub - domain .",
    "different scientific disciplines will have different network topologies @xcite and therefore may require different particle - swarm parameters .",
    "therefore , conflict of interest situations may not be so easily defined as those individuals 1 or 2 steps away in the co - authorship network .",
    "we recommend that this algorithm , before being implemented within a specific community other than the digital library community , be validated using the methodology described in this paper .",

    ". this network will include relationships between authors , papers , journals , conferences , publishers , and institutions represented in a multi - billion triple rdf triple store .",
    "future work in the area will allow us identify which relationships are most important in not only making this algorithm more accurate at identifying referees , but also conflict of interest situations .",
    "for one , various parameters of the algorithm will be tested to determine the role of prolificness of an author and how they effect the particle - swarm energy distribution .",
    "as authors write more papers , their connectivity and thus , the probability of being encountered by a particle increases .",
    "it may be important to understand how to adjust the algorithm to account for such aspects of a reviewer .",
    "the network model of the scholarly community will also include temporal information and thus , referee research trends could be taken into account to provide a mechanism of distinguishing between those referees in bid category @xmath82 and bid category @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the semantic network substrate will allow us to test various ` semantically - aware ' algorithms .",
    "for instance , the grammar - based particle - swarm algorithm @xcite can be used to direct the particles along a semantically meaningful path and thus will provide us with a wide - range of metrics for which to compare and contrast .",
    "we will be able to survey the full landscape of network analysis algorithm such that we may identify which algorithms and which semantics provide the best mechanism for identifying peer - reviewers .",
    "the peer - review process , in its present form , is mainly mediated by human efforts , i.e. authors , referees , and journal editors or conference organizers interact to produce a set of vetted , certified publications .",
    "this paper outlines an automatic referee identification algorithm that requires no human intervention , is computationally efficient , and can , to some extent , automatically identify conflict of interest situations .",
    "the referee weighting aspect of the algorithm provides a strong incentive for its use in open commentary peer - review .",
    "the level of automation provides the necessary infrastructure to decouple the publication process from the peer - review process in the sense that editors are no longer required to assign referees .",
    "a system that uses such an algorithm to identify and weight its reviewers is more efficient as well as more equitable and objective while at the same time potentially allowing any member of the community contribute a review to a manuscript .",
    "furthermore , a quantified peer - review service opens the peer - review process as an object of scientific inquiry .",
    "we identify an inherent paradox associated with referee identification .",
    "on the one hand , it is important to locate the most qualified referees to review a manuscript , while on the other , it is important to remove conflict of interest referees from the review process .",
    "the paradox lies in the fact that many of the most qualified referees are necessarily conflict of interest referees .",
    "therefore , an automated referee identification algorithm must achieve a balance between accepting qualified referees while at the same time rejecting conflict of interest referees .",
    "it can only be concluded that the current ` honor system ' will continue to play an important role in the peer - review process as no computer algorithm to date can accurately identify the social and political elements of conflict of interest situations of peer - review .",
