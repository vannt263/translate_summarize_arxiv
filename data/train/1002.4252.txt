    "describing the low - energy sector of qcd is a complicated task due to its strong coupling . especially investigating the region of the chiral and deconfinement phase transition requires non - perturbative methods . to describe these phenomena ,",
    "one therefore often employs effective models , which give a simplified description of the theory and are valid in a limited energy range . in this article",
    ", we focus on the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , where the quark - gluon interactions of qcd are substituted by effective 4-quark interactions .",
    "this model does not exhibit confinement , which is its major lack , but it incorporates chiral symmetry .",
    "spontaneous and explicit breaking of this symmetry as well as its restoration at high temperatures or densities can be realized .    despite the simplifications in the interaction ,",
    "the njl model can not be solved exactly , but further approximations are necessary . in most publications , the model has been treated in mean - field ( hartree ) and random - phase approximation to describe the chiral dynamics of quarks and the meson spectrum , both , in vacuum and in hot and dense matter @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of these approximations is that the effects of mesons on the quark propagator are not included . in the quark sector",
    "this leads to the wrong universal behavior at the phase transition and produces delta peaked quark spectral functions . as a consequence , for instance , they are not suitable to be used in the kubo formula for the calculation of shear viscosities  @xcite . in the mesonic sector ,",
    "hadronic decay channels , like @xmath1 , are not included , which are the physical decay channels in the confined phase .",
    "these processes can be included systematically within a @xmath0-expansion , i.e. , within an expansion in the inverse number of colors , beyond the leading order , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "one can basically follow two different approaches : in the `` strict @xmath0 expansion scheme '' one first solves the gap equation in leading order , i.e. , hartree approximation , and then adds the @xmath0 corrections to the quantities of interest perturbatively , without modifying and solving the gap equation again .",
    "this method yields good results , e.g. , for the rho - meson dominated electromagnetic pion form factor in the time - like region  @xcite as well as for the low - temperature behavior of the quark condensate  @xcite and the pressure  @xcite . above the critical temperature",
    "the model has been studied in @xcite where the influence of soft modes on the quark spectral function was investigated . on the other hand ,",
    "the perturbative approach breaks down in the vicinity of the phase transition , where a method is needed which incorporates the @xmath0 corrections self - consistently in the gap equation .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but in a simplified approach , where nonlocal contributions to the quark self - energy have been neglected .",
    "this scheme is thermodynamically inconsistent and it was found that the chiral phase transition at finite temperature is first order for two quark flavors  @xcite , in contradiction to universality arguments  @xcite .    in the present paper , we derive a self - consistent solution of the gap equation using the so - called @xmath2-derivable theory in next - to - leading order without further approximations .",
    "this approach is thermodynamically consistent and allows a meaningful investigation of the phase transition . due to the nonlocal self - energy contributions ,",
    "the structure of the equations is rather involved and we use the imaginary time ( matsubara ) formalism to keep them on a tractable level .",

    "as shown , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite this perturbative treatment yields the correct results for the low - temperature behavior of the quark condensate and the pressure . however , since the focus of the present paper is on the phase transition , which can not be treated perturbatively , we stay with the self - consistent expansion scheme outlined above .",
    "we should then be alerted to the fact that the intermediate rpa mesons do not obey the chiral ward identities .",
    "in this section we present numerical solutions of the self - consistent gap equation at nlo and related quantities .",

    "hence , unlike the hartree self - energy , which only yields a constant shift in the mass , the self - energy is now energy and momentum dependent and consists of several terms with different dirac structure . assuming a homogeneous medium with even parity , the inverse propagator can be parameterized as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a complex energy variable . in vacuum , as a consequence of lorentz invariance , the dressing functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are only functions of @xmath62 , and the functions @xmath59 and @xmath61 are equal . in the medium , however , where we have a preferred frame , we have three independent functions , which depend on energy and momentum separately .",

    "this has the advantage that it keeps the numerical effort for the involved self - consistency problem as simple as possible .",
    "moreover , it preserves the analytic structure in the complex energy plane .",
    "the obvious disadvantage is that the 3-momentum cutoffs violate the lorentz covariance . for the moment",
    ", we take this as a minor problem , which could be improved on in future modifications of the model .",
    "the non - covariance of the regularization also makes it necessary to specify how external 3-momenta are distributed to the propagators in a loop . in the rpa polarization functions , eq .",
