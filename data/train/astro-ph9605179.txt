    "in 1982 zeldovich suggested that the statistics derived from a percolation analysis of the density distribution might be useful in characterizing the topology of the distribution .",
    "soon after that shandarin ( 1983 ) and shandarin & zeldovich ( 1983 ) explored the possibility that the percolation properties of the galaxy distribution might provide a useful measure of the topology of the observed large - scale structure and act as a method for discriminating between various cosmological models .",
    "einasto , et al .",
    "( 1984 ) applied percolation analysis to the cfa i catalog .",
    "their findings indicated that the large - scale distribution of galaxies was consistent with a network - like structure .",
    "bhavsar & barrow ( 1983 ) applied the percolation method to theoretical studies of @xmath2-body models with power law initial conditions . in a @xmath3 universe they found that the @xmath4 case agreed much better with observations than the @xmath5 case .",
    "additional work which centered on the cdm spectrum by melott & shandarin ( 1983 ) and davis , et al .",
    "( 1985 ) demonstrated that the cdm model also has a connected , network - like structure as opposed to a clumpy distribution .",
    "dekel & west ( 1985 ) pointed out that the percolation method would depend strongly on the mean density of the sample , which would make the method difficult to use for sparse datasets .",
    "recent work by yess & shandarin ( 1995 ) has demonstrated that a percolation analysis of a continuous density field on a lattice is able to provide robust statistical measures of the underlying distribution which do not suffer from the earlier criticisms of dekel & west ( 1985 ) .    in their search for an objective method for the identification of filaments in observational",
    "datasets barrow , bhavsar & sonoda ( 1985 ) introduced the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) into the cosmological literature .",
    "the mst is a graph theoretical construct which has been used to quantify patterns in datasets ( zahn 1971 ) .",
    "barrow , et al ( 1985 ) developed several statistics based upon the mst from which they were able to differentiate between a poisson distribution of points and several observational datasets .",
    "the introduction of a bootstrap - based method , referred to as `` shuffling '' , allowed bhavsar & ling ( 1988 ) to ascertain the existence of the filaments in the cfa survey as real objects and not visual artifacts .",
    "recently krzewina & saslaw ( 1995 ) have introduced several additional statistics based upon the mst which they use to compare a subset of the southern sky redshift catalog ( ssrc ) to an @xmath2-body simulation and a poisson distribution .",
    "it is possible to construct the mst for any distribution of points in space ( gower & ross 1969 ; abraham 1962 ; zahn 1971 ) .",
    "the mst uniquely connects a set of @xmath2 points ( referred to as `` nodes '' ) with @xmath6 lines ( referred to as `` edges '' ) in such a way as to minimize the sum of the @xmath6 edges .",
    "consequently closed paths are excluded .",
    "this property has been exploited in the past as a way to objectively identify filamentary features(bhavsar & ling 1988 ) . the skeletal pattern defined by the mst",
    "can then be used to define a number of objective statistics ( barrow , et al .",
    "1985 ; krzewina & saslaw 1995 ) which describe the clustering of the data points .    in this work",
    "we first demonstrate that for a point data set the mst contains all of the information which is contained within a percolation analysis for that dataset .",
    "we then demonstrate the relative robustness of various percolation based statistical measures of the clustering for a poisson dataset .",
    "we should stress that rather than emphasizing a single number , such as the percolation threshold , we base our analysis on curves derived from the percolation analysis .",
    "we work with point datasets as the original percolation studies did .",
    "thus we use the simulations `` as they are '' and the techniques can be applied directly to the positional data from galaxy catalogs .",
    "this avoids problems with boundary conditions at the edge of the sample , and determining a density field from observational data .",
    "the time efficiency obtained using the mst to investigate the percolation properties has encouraged us to apply the statistics to a series of large @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "these studies should , we hope , pave the way for the eventual analysis for data from the large redshift surveys currently underway .",
    "to build the mst we use prim s algorithm ( 1957 ) . the simplest algorithm to construct explicitly the mst of a graph , @xmath7 , first picks an arbitrary node of @xmath7 and then adds the connected edge of smallest length .",
    "this edge and the two nodes at its ends form the partial tree , @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9th partial tree , @xmath10 , is formed by adding to @xmath11 the shortest edge connecting @xmath11 to any nodes of @xmath7 not already in @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath7 contains @xmath12 nodes then @xmath11 is the required mst .",
    "therefore , there is clearly small - scale information in the tree because of the way in which it is built , but the mst also contains large - scale information because the sum of all the edge lengths is a minimum .",
    "once an mst is constructed , separation is the operation of removing all edges whose length exceeds some cutoff .",
    "the percolation method we use was discussed in detail in bhavsar & barrow ( 1983 ) .",
    "the method consists of enclosing individual data points by a sphere of radius @xmath13 centered on the data point .",
    "all spheres which intersect form a cluster .",
    "typically a distribution of points and their enclosing sphere s is charaterized by some critical value of @xmath13 at which the length of the longest single connected chain of linked spheres grows to of order the size of the system .",
    "if this occurs then the system is said to percolate ( hammersley & welsh 1980 ) .",
    "now consider the following short thought experiment .",
    "assume that the data set has just percolated , so that the radius of the spheres surrounding each data point is given by percolation threshold @xmath14 .",
    "the distance between the two most spatially separated points in any cluster will be @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , if the mst for the same dataset is separated using a separation length of @xmath16 , subtrees will be identified which are separated by at least @xmath17 . as a consequence if we build the mst and begin separating the mst we should find that the linear extent of the largest sub - tree should exhibit exactly the same behavior as the longest percolating cluster determined by a percolation analysis .",
    "in fact carrying through the thought experiment for a series of edge lengths , we conjecture that separating the mst at every successive edge length starting from the largest to the smallest edge length , we recreate the entire percolation analysis at every possible sphere radius .",
    "since this is accomplished by just one construction of the mst and subsequent separating , the saving in computational time is enormous .",
    "our conjecture has been verified by numerical experiments which follow .",
    "the growth of the percolating cluster as a function of the separating length and also the sphere radius is shown and compared in figure 1 for a poisson distribution of @xmath18 particles .",
    "this plot shows only one such dataset .",
    "we have tested this method using many random realizations and consistently find the same result . to make the comparison between the two curves more qualitative we compute the @xmath19 error which we define as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the length of the percolating cluster determined using the percolation code , and @xmath22 is the length of the longest cluster using the mst / separation method proposed here .",
    "for figure 1 we find @xmath23 , clearly at the round - off level .",
    "this result is typical for the method .",
    "the percolation method scales as @xmath24 for _ each _ radius @xmath13 .",
    "so to identify the percolation threshold requires a significant amount of computer time .",
    "though building the mst is also a @xmath24 algorithm the separation process requires significantly fewer operations . as a consequence ,",
    "percolation analysis required roughly 46.5 cpu hours to produce the percolation graph in figure 1 , whereas the mst / separation method required only 4.8 cpu hours on a silicon graphics indigo2 to produce the identical plot ( also shown in figure 1 ) ! a savings of roughly an order of magnitude in runtime .",
    "this saving can be crucial depending on the size of the dataset .",
    "= 3.0truein 1.5truein",
    "in the past only the linear extent of the percolating cluster has been considered a primary statistic ( bhavsar & barrow 1983 ) . in",
    "recent years shandarin and his collaborators ( klypin & shandarin 1993 ; yess & shandarin 1995 ) have extended the percolation method to continuous density fields on a lattice and demonstrated the robustness of such methods for studying the large - scale distribution of mass .",
    "= 7.0truein .5truein    = 7.0truein .5truein    here we wish to present a new set of statistics based upon percolation using the mst based algorithm for point datasets .",
    "the first statistic we present for comparison is the usual linear extent of the percolating cluster as a function of the neighborhood radius @xmath13 , the radius of the spheres surrounding each point .",
    "the second is the mass of the percolating cluster normalized by the total mass in the simulation as a function of the neighborhood radius . to test the robustness of each of these statistics we generate 10 poisson distributions varying the number of particles in the box .",
    "figure 2 shows the linear extent of the percolating cluster for four particle densities .",
    "the first is @xmath25 particles in a box of size @xmath25 , the second is a @xmath18 subset of the original @xmath25 particles in the same volume , the third is a @xmath26 subset and the final is a @xmath27 subset of the original @xmath25 particles .",
    "figure 3 shows the mass of the percolating cluster as a fraction of the total mass in the simulation for the same four subsets of particles .",
    "each point is the average over the ten realizations , and the error bars represent the @xmath28 deviations from the averages .",
    "interestingly the mass of the percolating cluster appears to be a more robust indicator of the onset of percolation than the linear extent of the cluster .",
    "this is nt unexpected .",
    "as the particle density is reduced shot noise due to undersampling can have a much more serious impact on the length of the cluster than its mass .",
    "for instance , by removing one particle its possible that the length of the percolating cluster could change dramatically , but it is unlikely that removing one particle will have much of an effect on the total mass of the cluster .",
    "further , the mass curve ( figure 3 ) demonstrates that it is a much more robust measure of the percolation properties of the dataset .",
    "the curves allow one to accurately estimate the percolation length for as little as 1/64th of the original particle density , which corresponds to the @xmath26 subset . even for the @xmath27 subset",
    "where there is a factor of 512 fewer particles the percolation length can be estimated to within 20% or so . based upon the linear extent of the cluster both of the @xmath27 subset and the @xmath26 subset are relatively worthless in estimating the percolation threshold .",
    "the particle - mesh ( pm ) code used to generate the simulations used in this work has been described in detail by melott ( 1986 ) . the code is a standard pm code , except that it uses a staggered grid to obtain slightly better force resolution ( melott et al .",
    "the simulations use @xmath29 particles on a comoving @xmath29 mesh . for the percolation studies here we use a @xmath18 subset of those particles .",
    "we ran simulations for four different power law initial spectra , @xmath30 , all for a @xmath31 universe .",
    "ten realizations of each of the above four spectra were performed .",
    "these realizations were studied at the nonlinear wavenumbers @xmath32 and the initial conditions ; @xmath33 is defined by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the initial power spectrum of the density fluctuations , and @xmath36 is the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "the percolation statistics were run on the ten realizations at each evolutionary stage .",
    "then the averages and the 1 @xmath37 deviations were computed .",
    "the results for the percolation statistics are plotted in figure 4 . to make the comparisons more qualitative we compute the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic and significance level ( press , et al 1992 ) between each of the curves plotted in figure 4 .",
    "these are presented in tables 1 & 2 .",
    ".significance levels computed between the 4 @xmath2-body models for the length of the percolating cluster statistic .",
    "the dimensionless neighborhood radius is defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath12 is the particle density . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have shown that one can generate the standard percolation statistics from the minimal spanning tree .",
    "this allows us a large increase in the speed with which we can perform a percolation analysis of a point dataset .",
    "our calculations indicate that we can gain as much as a factor of 10 in the computer time needed to perform the data analysis .",
    "this will become increasingly important as large redshift surveys become available .",
    "in addition we argue , based upon poisson distributions , that the percolation method is a robust statistical method when the apropriate statistic is used .",
    "past studies have argued that the percolation threshold as determined from the linear extent of the percolating cluster is not a robust measure of percolation ( dekel & west 1985 ) .",
    "we confirm that result .",
    "contrary to the conclusions of dekel & west by considering the behavior of the entire curve rather than focusing on a particular parameter of that curve we find that a more robust estimate of the percolation properties is possible .",
    "the mass of the percolating cluster appears to be very robust with respect to sampling , as opposed to the linear extent of the cluster which is relatively poorly behaved .",
    "this is not unexpected as discussed in the text above .",
    "based upon this statistic the percolation threshold can be reliably estimated even when the particle density varies by large factors .",
    "we conclude by applying these percolation statistics to 4 @xmath2-body models with different scale - free gaussian initial conditions . based upon our comparisons of the curves in figure 4 using the ks test ( see tables 1 & 2 )",
    "it is clear that with the exception of the @xmath5 and @xmath39 models the percolation statistics can easily distinguish between the models .",
    "both percolation statistics considered here are able to distinguish between models equally well ( recall a small significance level indicates that the two distributions are not consistent with the same parent distribution ) , but it is only the mass of the percolating cluster which is strongly robust to changes in particle density .",
    "thus we conclude that percolation may be a sensitive discriminator between cosmological models if clustering is not too hierarchical .",
    "one of us ( rjs ) would like to thank the center for computational sciences at the university of kentucky for providing financial support .",
    "the computer simulations were performed on the convex exemplar at the university of kentucky .",
    "we would also like to thank oliver skellin and bill lahaise for helping with the mst and separtion code ."
