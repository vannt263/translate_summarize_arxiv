    "the dynamics of tracers in turbulent flows has important applications in a variety of physical phenomena ranging from the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants @xcite to the transport of plankton in the oceans @xcite .",
    "moreover , the motion of tracers is intimately related to the mixing properties of turbulent flows and therefore determines the statistics of passive fields such as temperature in a weakly heated fluid or the concentration of a dye in a liquid @xcite .",
    "the last fifteen years have seen a renewed interest in the lagrangian study of turbulence thanks to the development of new experimental and numerical particle - tracking techniques @xcite .    several of the qualitative properties of tracer dynamics in turbulent flows have been understood by means of the @xcite model , in which the velocity is a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian field with zero correlation time and power - law spatial correlations . under these assumptions ,",
    "the separations between tracers form a multi - dimensional diffusion process with space - dependent diffusivity , the properties of which have been studied analytically @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the smooth and incompressible regime of the kraichnan model , tracers behave chaotically and spread out evenly in the fluid .",
    "if the velocity field is weakly compressible , the lagrangian dynamics remains chaotic , but tracers cluster over a fractal set with lyapunov dimension @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spatial dimension of the fluid @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov dimension decreases as the degree of compressibility increases ; furthermore , the density of tracers exhibits a multifractal behaviour in space , which indicates the presence of strong fluctuations in the distribution of tracers within the fluid @xcite .",
    "finally , if the degree of compressibility of the kraichnan model exceeds a critical value , all the lyapunov exponents of the flow become negative and tracers collapse onto a pointlike fractal with @xmath2 .",
    "this latter regime only exists if @xmath3 @xcite and is known as the regime of strong compressibility .    in nature",
    ", compressible flows are found not only for large values of the mach number .",
    "an example of a low - mach - number compressible flow is given by the velocity field on the free surface of a three - dimensional incompressible flow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at small stokes numbers , the dynamics of inertial particles in an incompressible flow can be assimilated to that of tracers in an effective compressible velocity field @xcite .",
    "compressible flows like those mentioned above have a nonzero correlation time . in this respect ,",
    "the kraichnan model is not realistic and quantitative discrepancies may be expected between the theoretical predictions and the experimental and numerical observations . in a numerical simulation of a turbulent surface flow , @xcite have found that @xmath4 does decrease as a function of the degree of compressibility , in accordance with the prediction of the kraichnan model .",
    "however , the transition from the weak- to the strong - clustering regime occurs at a larger degree of compressibility compared to the kraichnan model .",
    "this phenomenon is counterintuitive , because the level of clustering would be expected to increase when the correlation of the flow is nonzero .",
    "thus , the study by @xcite raises the questions of the interplay between compressibility and temporal correlation in turbulent flows and of the degree of universality of the weak  strong clustering transition ( for further studies on clustering in turbulent surface flows , see * ? ? ?",

    "the investigation of the universality of this phenomenon is particulartly interesting in the light of previous findings of non - universal transport properties in random compressible flows for passive scalar fields @xcite .    for inertial particles ,",
    "the effect of the temporal correlation of the flow on the lagrangian dynamics has been studied analytically in the following one - dimensional cases : for a velocity gradient described by the telegraph noise @xcite or by the ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xcite and for a velocity field given by a gaussian potential with exponential correlations @xcite . in the case of tracers in compressible flows ,",
    "@xcite have studied two - particle dispersion in gaussian self - similar random fields . @xcite",
    "have calculated the lyapunov exponent and the statistics of the stretching rates for a one - dimensional strain described by the telegraph noise . @xcite",
    "have obtained the lyapunov exponents of a two - dimensional random flow in the limits of short and long correlation times ; the solenoidal and potential components of the velocity were assumed to be gaussian random functions with exponential spatio - temporal correlations .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a thorough study of the effects of temporal correlations on tracer dynamics in a compressible random flow .",
    "we consider a compressible version of the two - dimensional renewing flow , which consists of a random sequence of sinusoidal velocity profiles with variable origin and orientation .",
    "each profile remains frozen for a fixed time ; by changing the duration of the frozen phase , we can vary the correlation time of the flow and examine the effect on clustering .",
    "the renewing flow , in its original incompressible version , has been successfully applied to the study of the kinematic dynamo @xcite , of chaotic mixing @xcite , of inertial - particles dynamics @xcite and of polymer stretching @xcite .",
    "the properties of this model flow allow us to fully characterise the lagrangian statistics of tracers as a function of the degree of compressibility and for a wide range of correlation times .",
    "we show that , in a time - correlated compressible flow , even single - time lagrangian averages can differ considerably from their eulerian counterparts .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the properties of clustering do not depend only on universal parameters such as the degree of compressibility and the kubo number , but also on the specific spatial and temporal properties of the velocity field .",
    "in particular , we show that a crucial role is played by the spatial distribution of the stagnation points .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in   [ section : renewing ]",
    ", we introduce the compressible renewing flow and describe its eulerian properties . in   [ sec : lagr - euler ] , we compare the lagrangian and eulerian statistics of tracer dynamics as a function of the degree of compressibility and of the correlation time of the flow .",

    "however , it can be regarded as stationary for times much longer than @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the temporal statistics of the flow is characterised by the correlation function : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a space - time eulerian average : @xmath30 .",

    "the transition from the regime of weak compressibility to that of strong compressibility occurs when the maximum lyapunov exponent of the flow becomes negative . in this case , the flow is not chaotic anymore and tracers are attracted to a pointlike set . to study this transition , it is useful to consider the set of stagnation points of the flow , in which @xmath39",
    ". tracers indeed tend to accumulate in the neighbourhood of these points . from and",
    ", we deduce that the set of stagnation points of the renewing flow consists of the two lines : @xmath40 if the velocity is given by , or @xmath41 if the velocity is given by . in and",
    ", @xmath42 is such that @xmath43 .",
    "the stagnation lines are shown in figure  [ fig : stagnation ] for some representative values of the degree of compressibility . if @xmath44 , the flow consists of parallel periodic ` channels ' of width @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 , the stagnation lines form barriers that block the motion of tracers over a portion of the domain whose size increases as @xmath47 approaches 1/2 ; the width of the periodic channels shrinks accordingly . finally , if @xmath48 , the stagnation lines divide the domain into regions that are not linked by any streamline . for these values of @xmath47 , there are no periodic trajectories and if @xmath33 is sufficiently large , all tracers collapse onto the stagnation lines . we conclude that the transition from the regime of weak clustering to that of strong clustering must occur for @xmath49 .",
    "however , the critical value of the degree of compressibility depends on @xmath33 .",
    "the properties of the flow introduced in   [ section : renewing ] , namely the root - mean - square velocity , the degree of compressibility and the correlation function , are of an eulerian nature .",
    "if the flow is compressible and has a nonzero correlation time , the lagrangian counterparts of the aforementioned quantities may be different .",
    "indeed , tracers are attracted towards the stagnation points and hence do not sample the phase space uniformly .",
    "we define the root - mean - square lagrangian velocity as : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is a lagrangian average over both the random trajectory @xmath53 and time .",
    "figure  [ fig : urms_tc ] ( left panel ) compares @xmath54 and its eulerian counterpart @xmath55 for different values of @xmath33 and @xmath47 .",
    "the plot includes 51 values of @xmath47 between 0 and 1/2 and 31 values of @xmath33 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "for each couple @xmath58 , we have computed @xmath54 by solving for @xmath57 tracers and for an integration time @xmath59 ( to integrate , we have used a fourth - order runge ",

    "likewise , at @xmath63 the eulerian and the lagrangian statistics coincide independently of the value of @xmath47 . by contrast , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 because tracers are attracted towards the stagnation lines , where @xmath67 .",
    "the ability of the stagnation points to trap tracers strengthens with increasing @xmath47 and @xmath60 ; hence @xmath61 eventually approaches zero .",
    "the lagrangian correlation function of the velocity is defined as : @xmath68 the associate lagrangian correlation time is : @xmath69 .     for @xmath35 ( dotted , blue curve ) and @xmath36 ( solid , red curve ) ; the inset shows the lagrangian correlation time rescaled by @xmath70 as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath36 .",

    "again , this behaviour can be explained by considering that a tracer is attracted towards the stagnation points , where @xmath67 , and hence its velocity decorrelates from the velocity it had at the beginning of the period .",
    "as @xmath60 and @xmath47 increase , a larger fraction of tracers get close to the stagnation points , and therefore the decorrelation is faster .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : corr - time ] ( left panel ) also shows that , for @xmath75 close to 1/2 , @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath25 for small values of @xmath60 , whereas it saturates to a value proportional to the eddy turnover time for large values of @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , after that time most of the tracers have reached a stagnation point , and their velocities have completely decorrelated .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr - time ] ( right panel ) shows that , for small values of @xmath60 , @xmath76 is the same as @xmath77 irrespective of the value of @xmath47 .",
    "however , at large @xmath60 , not only the lagrangian correlation time of the velocity , but also the functional form of @xmath76 varies with @xmath47 .",
    "the degree of compressibility experienced by tracers also depends on @xmath60 and @xmath47 and differs from its eulerian value if @xmath78 and @xmath64 .",
    "let us define the lagrangian degree of compressibility as : @xmath79 .",
    "then , @xmath80 for all nonzero values of @xmath60 and @xmath47 , because tracers spend more time in high - compressibility regions",
    ". for fixed @xmath60 , the increase in compressibility is an increasing function of @xmath47 , whereas for fixed @xmath47 it is maximum when @xmath60 is near to  1 and vanishes both in the small- and in the large-@xmath60 limits ( figure  [ fig : compressibility_lyap1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the lagrangian compressibility as a function of @xmath60 is due to a peculiar feature of the model flow considered here .",
    "the stagnation lines and toward which the tracers are attracted do not coincide with the regions where the local compressibility of the flow is maximum , i.e. , the lines @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , in the long - correlated limit the preferential sampling of the regions of strong compressibility is reduced .",
    "the spatial distribution of tracers within a fluid can be characterised in terms of the lyapunov dimension ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the lyapunov exponents of the flow and @xmath87 is the maximum integer such that @xmath88 ( @xmath1 denotes the dimension of the flow ) .",
    "three different regimes can be identified .",

    "right : maximum lyapunov exponent of the compressible renewing flow as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath47 ]    for the smooth @xmath1-dimensional @xcite flow , the lyapunov exponents can be calculated exactly ( we remind the reader that in the kraichnan model the velocity field is gaussian , delta - correlated in time , and statistically homogenous and isotropic ) .",

    "we study how the weak ",
    "strong clustering transition depends on @xmath60 in the compressible renewing flow . to compute the lyapunov exponents ,",
    "we have used the method proposed by @xcite ; we have set the integration time to @xmath100 for all values of @xmath60 and @xmath47 in order to ensure the convergence of the stretching rates to their asymptotic values .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent decreases with increasing @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : compressibility_lyap1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "its behaviour as a function of @xmath60 is different in the weakly compressible and in the strongly compressible regimes . for small values of @xmath47 , @xmath94 is maximum for @xmath60 near to  1 , which signals an increase in chaoticity when the correlation time of the flow is comparable to the eddy turnover time .",
    "by contrast , for values of @xmath47 near to 1/2 , @xmath94 is minimum at @xmath101 , in accordance with the fact that the lagrangian compressibility is maximum for these values of the parameters ( figure  [ fig : compressibility_lyap1 ] ) .",
    "we also note that if @xmath60 is near to  1 , @xmath94 becomes negative for @xmath102 ; hence the weak  strong clustering transition occurs at a lower degree of compressibility compared to the short - correlated case .",

    "the behaviour as a function of @xmath60 is not monotonic and depends on the value of @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath60 is near to 1 , the level of clustering is minimum if @xmath75 is small and is maximum if @xmath75 is near to 1/2 ; furthermore , @xmath4 vanishes for values of @xmath47 smaller than the critical value of the short - correlated case .",
    "the most important deviations of @xmath4 from the @xmath71 prediction are observed for values of @xmath60 greater than 1 ( figure  [ fig : d_l ] , right panel ) .",
    "we have studied the lagrangian dynamics of tracers in a time - correlated compressible random flow as a function of the degree of compressibility and the kubo number .",
    "the use of the compressible renewing flow has allowed us to examine a wide area of the parameter space @xmath58 .",
    "we have shown that , in compressible random flows with nonzero correlation time , lagrangian correlations differ significantly from their eulerian counterparts , because tracers are attracted towards the stagnation points and therefore do not sample the phase space uniformly .",
    "this fact influences the spatial distribution of tracers within the fluid .",
    "in particular , in both the small- and the large-@xmath60 limits , the critical degree of compressibility for the weak  strong clustering transition is the same as for a short - correlated flow .",
    "by contrast , when the correlation time of the flow is comparable to the eddy turnover time , a smaller degree of compressibility is required for the transition to occur .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the critical degree of compressibility is a consequence of the fact that the stagnation points do not coincide with the points in which the compressibility is maximum .",
    "this behaviour is very different from that observed by @xcite in a gaussian velocity field with exponential spatio - temporal correlations . in that flow ,",
    "the critical degree of compressibility indeed decreseases monotonically as a function of @xmath60 and tends to zero in the large-@xmath60 limit , i.e. the weak ",
    "strong clustering transition is more and more favoured as @xmath60 increases .",
    "the comparison of our results for intermediate values of @xmath60 with those by @xcite reveals yet another difference . in the compressible renewing flow , the clustering is reduced compared to the small-@xmath60 case if the compressibility is small , but it is enhanced if the compressibility is large .",
    "this behaviour is the opposite of that found in the turbulent surface flow ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the renewing flow , the critical degree of compressibility is less than or equal to 1/2 for all values of @xmath60 ; in the surface flow , it is significantly greater ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) . in the light of our findings , it would be interesting to examine the distribution of the stagnation points of the surface flow considered by @xcite and understand how it influences the statistics of clustering .     as a function of @xmath47 for the kraichnan model ( solid , black curve ) and for the compressible renewing flow with @xmath5 ( dotted , red curve ) and @xmath104 ( dashed , blue curve ) .",
    "the square symbols are from the direct numerical simulation of a turbulent surface flow by @xcite.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    in conclusion , the differences between our findings and those obtained in different flows demonstrate that the properties of tracer dynamics in time - correlated compressible flows are strongly non - universal , to the extent that flows with comparable @xmath75 and @xmath60 can have an opposite effect on clustering .",
