    "the theory of black holes appears finally to be reaching a stage of maturity in which it can be applied in the most interesting , distorted , dynamic situations , with appropriate definitions of relevant physical quantities .",
    "this article mainly concerns angular momentum and its conservation , which is the last major piece of what seems to be an essentially complete new paradigm for black holes .",
    "it therefore seems timely to review below the key ideas and results of what might be called the heroic , classical and modern eras .",
    "the first solution which would nowadays be called a black hole was discovered by schwarzschild @xcite within a few weeks of the final formulation of the field equations of general relativity by einstein @xcite , as the external gravitational field of a point with mass @xmath0 .",
    "charge @xmath1 was soon added by reissner @xcite and nordstrm @xcite , but even the schwarzschild solution was not properly understood for decades .",
    "schwarzschild described the mass point as located at what is now understood as the horizon , despite its non - zero area @xmath2 .",
    "einstein & rosen @xcite realized that the spatial geometry had a wormhole structure , extending through a minimal surface .",
    "oppenheimer & snyder @xcite constructed a model of stellar collapse in which the star collapses through the horizon .",
    "finally kruskal @xcite , as reported in a paper actually written by wheeler @xcite , described the entire space - time , whence it became clear that there was a trapped region inside the horizon , from which nothing could escape to the exterior .",
    "angular momentum @xmath3 was added by kerr @xcite and , including @xmath1 , by newman et al .",
    "uniqueness theorems identify these as the only black holes which are stationary , asymptotically flat , electrovac solutions .",
    "wheeler @xcite is credited with coining the term `` black hole '' and penrose @xcite with defining event horizons , which became the accepted definition of black holes . hawking",
    "@xcite showed that the area of an event horizon was non - decreasing , @xmath4 .",
    "the result became known as a `` second law '' , due to inaccurate analogies with the laws of thermodynamics and the results summarized by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite : a `` zeroth law '' that surface gravity @xmath5 is constant on a stationary black hole ; a `` first law '' @xmath6 for perturbations of stationary black holes , where @xmath7 is the angular speed and @xmath8 the electric potential of the horizon , and the adm energy @xmath9 measures the total mass of the space - time ; and a `` third law '' that @xmath10 by positive - energy perturbations of stationary black holes .",
    "this summarizes the classical theory of black holes as described in textbooks @xcite .",
    "the last results above are perhaps best described as black - hole statics , being properties of stationary black holes , specifically of killing horizons , rather than of general event horizons . while adequate in some astrophysical situations , this classical theory is inapplicable to general dynamical processes , for instance black - hole formation , rapid evolution and binary mergers .",
    "a theory of black - hole dynamics is needed , with generalizations of all the above - mentioned quantities .",
    "event horizons are not an appropriate platform , since they can not be located by mortals , let alone admit physical measurements .",
    "a more practical way to locate a black hole is by a _ marginal surface _ , an extremal surface of a null hypersurface , where light rays are momentarily caught by the gravitational field .",
    "marginal surfaces are used extensively in numerical simulations , where they have historically been called apparent horizons , though the textbook definition of the latter is different @xcite . here a hypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces will be called a _ trapping horizon_.    a systematic treatment of trapping horizons @xcite distinguished four sub - classes , called future or past , outer or inner trapping horizons , with the future outer type proposed as the practical location of a black hole .",
    "such a horizon was shown to have several expected properties of a black hole , assuming the einstein equation and positive - energy conditions : the horizon is achronal , being null in a special case of quasi - stationarity , but otherwise being spatial ; the area form @xmath11 of the marginal surfaces is constant in the null case and increasing in the spatial case ; and the marginal surfaces have spherical topology , if compact .",
    "the area law implies that the area @xmath12 of the marginal surfaces @xmath13 is non - decreasing , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the lie derivative and @xmath16 the generating vector of the marginal surfaces .",
    "so a black hole grows if something falls into it , otherwise staying the same size .",
    "comprehensive treatments were subsequently given for spherical symmetry @xcite , cylindrical symmetry @xcite and a quasi - spherical approximation @xcite .",
    "in each case , definitions were found for all the non - zero physical quantities mentioned above , providing prototypes of all except @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , an effective energy tensor @xmath17 for gravitational radiation was found , entering equations additively to the matter energy tensor @xmath18 .",
    "the einstein equations were decomposed into forms with manifest physical meaning , such as a quasi - newtonian gravitational law , a wave equation for the gravitational radiation , and an energy conservation law which can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the normal dual of @xmath16 and @xmath21 is a certain vector , playing the role of a killing vector , which is null on the horizon .",
    "such equations actually hold not just on a trapping horizon , but anywhere in the space - time , energy conservation reducing at null infinity to the bondi energy equation .    contemporaneously , ashtekar et al .  and",
    "others @xcite developed a theory of null trapping horizons with various additional conditions , under the names non - rotating isolated horizons , non - expanding horizons , weakly isolated horizons , rigidly rotating horizons and ( strongly ) isolated horizons .",
    "each is intended to capture the idea that the black hole is quasi - stationary in some sense .",
    "they gave definitions of all the relevant physical quantities and derived a generalized version of the so - called first law .",
    "subsequently , ashtekar & krishnan @xcite studied future spatial trapping horizons under the name dynamical horizons , giving classes of definitions of energy and angular momentum , deriving corresponding flux equations and obtaining a version of the so - called first law for @xmath22 .",
    "however , the `` 3 + 1 '' formalism used to describe spatial trapping horizons breaks down when the horizon becomes null , so that the isolated - horizon and dynamical - horizon frameworks were essentially distinct .",
    "some connections were drawn , particularly for slowly evolving horizons by booth & fairhurst @xcite .",
    "recently , andersson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a stable trapping horizon is , on any one marginal surface , either spatial or null everywhere , so that transitions between the two types happen simultaneously on a marginal surface .",
    "they and ashtekar & galloway @xcite also obtained some existence and uniqueness results for trapping horizons .",
    "a unified framework for any trapping horizon is provided by a dual - null formalism @xcite , which was used throughout the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the energy flux equation was then cast in a surface - integral form where the null limit could be taken @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was cast in the form of a conservation law ( [ ec0 ] ) , by identifying an effective energy tensor @xmath17 .",
    "the mass @xmath0 , which might take any value on a given @xmath13 by choice of scaling of @xmath21 , was chosen to be the irreducible mass or hawking mass @xcite for consistency with the earlier studies .",
    "this corresponds to the simplest general definition of @xmath21 , such that it becomes a unit vector for round spheres near infinity .",
    "the main task here is to make similar refinements for angular momentum , as briefly described in shorter articles @xcite .",
    "in particular , one desires not just a flux equation but a conservation law of the form @xmath23 here @xmath24 should be an axial vector in some sense , playing the role of an axial killing vector , with @xmath3 being the angular momentum about that axis .",
    "it turns out that natural restrictions on @xmath24 allow it to be uniquely specified under certain generic conditions . the angular momentum , initially a functional @xmath25 $ ] ,",
    "is obtained directly from the komar integral @xcite in terms of a 1-form @xmath26 known as the twist @xcite , which reduces to the 1-form used for dynamical horizons @xcite .",
    "it encodes the rotational frame - dragging predicted in the lense - thirring effect , thereby giving a precise meaning to the twisting around of space - time due to a rotating mass .",
    "the null limit is more subtle for angular momentum than for energy , where the irreducible mass is uniquely defined for a null trapping horizon , energy conservation ( [ ec0 ] ) reducing correctly to @xmath27 .",
    "the dual - null foliation becomes non - unique for a null hypersurface , with @xmath26 becoming non - unique .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that different 1-forms were used for isolated horizons @xcite and dynamical horizons @xcite .",
    "neither 1-form is necessarily preserved along a null trapping horizon , but a certain linear combination is so preserved . however , all three 1-forms coincide if the non - uniqueness of the dual - null foliation for a null hypersurface is fixed in a certain way .",
    "then @xmath25 $ ] becomes unique for a null trapping horizon and conservation ( [ amc0 ] ) reduces as desired to @xmath28 .",
    "thus a consistent treatment of angular momentum naturally resolves the issue of the degeneracy of the null limit .",
    "it follows that a black hole can not change its angular momentum without increasing its area .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii summarizes the underlying geometry .",
    "section iii reviews trapping horizons and conservation of energy .",
    "section iv derives angular momentum from the komar integral and shows how restrictions on the axial vector can be used to construct a unique definition .",

    "section vii describes the state space , defining the remaining physical quantities and deriving a dynamical version of the so - called first law .",

    "the geometrical object of interest is a one - parameter family @xmath30 of spatial surfaces @xmath13 , locally generating a foliated hypersurface @xmath31 .",
    "labelling the surfaces by a coordinate @xmath32 , they are generated by a vector @xmath33 , which can be taken to be normal to the surfaces , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes projection onto @xmath13 . a hodge duality operation on normal vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , yields a dual normal vector @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 in particular",
    ", @xmath40 is normal to @xmath31 , with the same scaling ( fig.[normal ] ) .",
    "the coordinate freedom here is just @xmath41 and choice of transverse coordinates on @xmath13 , under which all the key formulas will be invariant .",
    "the generating vector @xmath16 may have any causal character , at each point .",
    "for instance , a future outer trapping horizon is spatial while growing , becomes null when quasi - stationary , and would become temporal if shrinking during evaporation @xcite .",
    "foliated by spatial surfaces @xmath13 , with generating vector @xmath16 and its normal dual @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath31 becomes null , @xmath16 and @xmath20 coincide.,height=56 ]    a dual - null formalism @xcite describes two families of null hypersurfaces @xmath43 , intersecting in a two - parameter family of spatial surfaces , including the desired one - parameter family .",
    "some merits of the dual - null approach , apart from comparative ease of calculation , are that it is adapted both to marginal surfaces , defined as extremal surfaces of null hypersurfaces , and to radiation propagation , which makes it easier to identify terms arising due to gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "relevant aspects of the formalism are summarized as follows .",
    "labelling @xmath44 by coordinates @xmath45 which increase to the future , one may take transverse coordinates @xmath46 on @xmath13 , which for a sphere would normally be angular coordinates @xmath47 .",
    "writing space - time coordinates @xmath48 indicates how one may use greek letters @xmath49 for space - time indices and corresponding latin letters @xmath50 for transverse indices . the coordinate basis vectors are @xmath51 and the dual 1-forms are @xmath52 , satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "coordinate vectors commute , @xmath54=0 $ ] , where the brackets denote the lie bracket or commutator .",
    "two coordinate vectors have a special role , the evolution vectors @xmath55 which generate the dynamics , spanning an integrable evolution space .",
    "the corresponding normal 1-forms @xmath56 are null by assumption : @xmath57 the relative normalization of the null normals may be encoded in a function @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 where the metric sign convention is that spatial metrics are positive definite .",
    "the transverse metric , or the induced metric on @xmath13 , is found to be @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the symmetric tensor product .",
    "there are two shift vectors @xmath62 where @xmath35 is generalized to indicate projection by @xmath63 .",
    "the null normal vectors @xmath64 are future - null and satisfy @xmath65 the metric takes the form @xmath66 then @xmath67 are configuration fields and the independent momentum fields are found to be linear combinations of the following transverse tensors : @xmath68)\\label{tw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the hodge operator of @xmath63 and @xmath70 is shorthand for the lie derivative along @xmath71 . then the functions @xmath72 are the null expansions , the traceless bilinear forms @xmath73 are the null shears , the 1-form @xmath26 is the twist , measuring the lack of integrability of the normal space , and the functions @xmath74 are the inaffinities , measuring the failure of the null normals to be affine . the fields @xmath75 encode the extrinsic curvature of the dual - null foliation .",
    "these extrinsic fields are unique up to interchange @xmath76 and diffeomorphisms @xmath77 which relabel the null hypersurfaces",
    ". further description of the geometry was given recently @xcite .",
    "as described , the dual - null formalism is manifestly covariant on @xmath13 , with transverse indices not explicitly denoted , while @xmath78 indices indicate the chosen normal basis @xcite .",
    "conversely , one can use a formalism which is manifestly covariant on the normal space , with transverse but not normal indices explicitly denoted @xcite .",
    "both types of formalism can seem obscure to the uninitiated , so indices will be explicitly denoted in longer formulas in this article , nevertheless being omitted where the meaning should be clear .",
    "capital latin letters @xmath79 will be used for normal indices , when not denoted by @xmath78 in the dual - null basis .",
    "then the configuration fields are @xmath80 , the momentum fields are @xmath81 and the derivative operators are @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the covariant derivative operator of @xmath63 .",
    "since the normal space is not integrable unless @xmath84 , it generally does not admit a coordinate basis .",
    "however , one may still take @xmath56 as basis 1-forms , in which case the dual basis vectors are @xmath71 , as follows from ( [ ls ] ) , implying @xmath85 .",
    "in this basis , the normal metric @xmath86 has components which follow from ( [ tm ] ) as @xmath87 and its inverse has components @xmath88 which can be used to lower and raise normal indices . also useful is the binormal @xmath89 or its inverse @xmath90 the mixed form @xmath91 has components @xmath92 , @xmath93 , so can be used to express the duality operation ( [ nd ] ) on normal vectors , extended to the dual - null foliation , as @xmath94    the dual - null hamilton equations and integrability conditions for vacuum einstein gravity were derived previously @xcite , with matter terms added subsequently @xcite .",

    "since the twist encodes the non - integrability of the normal space , it provides a geometrical measure of rotational frame - dragging .",
    "it is an invariant of a dual - null foliation and therefore of a non - null foliated hypersurface @xmath31 , so the twist expression for @xmath25 $ ] is also an invariant .",
    "appendix a shows that @xmath25 $ ] recovers the standard definition of angular momentum for a weak - field metric @xcite , with the twist being directly related to the precessional angular velocity of a gyroscope due to the lense - thirring effect .",
    "thus the twist does indeed encode the twisting around of space - time caused by a rotating mass .",
    "there are several definitions of angular momentum which are similar surface integrals of an axial vector contracted with a 1-form @xcite , the situation being clarified by gourgoulhon @xcite and in appendix b. ashtekar & krishnan @xcite gave a definition for a dynamical horizon which involves a 1-form coinciding with @xmath26 .",
    "brown & york @xcite gave a definition which was stated only for an axial killing vector @xmath24 , involving a 1-form which is generally inequivalent to @xmath26 , but can be made to coincide if adapted to a trapping horizon .",
    "ashtekar et al.@xcite gave a definition for a type ii ( rigidly rotating ) isolated horizon , using a 1-form which is generally inequivalent to @xmath26 .",
    "however , it can be made to coincide with @xmath26 if the dual - null foliation is fixed in a natural way , as described in the penultimate section .",
    "the above properties suggest ( [ am ] ) as a general quasi - local definition of angular momentum .",
    "however , if the transverse vector @xmath24 does not have properties expected of an axial vector , the physical interpretation as angular momentum is questionable .",
    "for instance , it would be natural to expect an axial vector to have integral curves which form a smooth foliation of circles , apart from two poles , assuming spherical topology for @xmath13 . in the following ,",
    "two conditions on @xmath24 with various motivations will be considered , which , taken together , determine @xmath24 uniquely in a certain generic situation .",
    "these conditions then yield a conservation law with the desired form ( [ amc0 ] ) , as described in the next section .    .,height=113 ]    ashtekar & krishnan @xcite proposed that @xmath24 has vanishing transverse divergence : @xmath128 this condition holds if @xmath24 is an axial killing vector , and can be understood as a weaker condition , equivalent to @xmath24 generating a symmetry of the area form rather than of the whole metric , since @xmath129 . alternatively , assuming that the integral curves of @xmath24 are closed , it can always be satisfied by choice of scaling of @xmath24 , as discussed by booth & fairhurst @xcite .",
    "the original motivation was that the different 1-forms used for dynamical and isolated horizons , denoted here by @xmath26 and @xmath130 , will then give the same angular momentum @xmath25 $ ] , by the gauss divergence theorem .",
    "spherical topology will be assumed henceforth for @xmath13 , which follows from the topology law @xcite for outer trapping horizons , assuming the dominant energy condition .",
    "if there exist angular coordinates @xmath131 on @xmath13 with @xmath132 , completing coordinates @xmath133 on @xmath31 , then since coordinate vectors commute , @xmath134 this condition was proposed as a natural way to propagate @xmath24 along @xmath31 by gourgoulhon @xcite .",
    "now there is a commutator identity @xcite @xmath135 therefore assuming both conditions ( [ div])([lie ] ) forces @xmath136 this is automatically satisfied if @xmath137 , as in spherical symmetry or along a null trapping horizon .",
    "however , generically one expects @xmath138 almost everywhere .",
    "it must vanish somewhere on a sphere , by the hairy ball theorem , but the simplest generic situation is that there are curves @xmath139 of constant @xmath107 which form a smooth foliation of circles , covering the surface except for two poles ( fig.[axial ] ) .",
    "assuming so , since @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath139 , one can find a unique @xmath24 , up to sign , in terms of the unit tangent vector @xmath140 and arc length @xmath141 along @xmath139 : @xmath142 where the scaling ensures that the axial coordinate @xmath143 is identified at 0 and @xmath144 .",
    "then the angular momentum becomes unique up to sign , @xmath25=j$ ] , the sign being naturally fixed by @xmath145 and continuity of @xmath24 , corresponding to a choice of orientation .     of constant expansion @xmath107.,height=94 ]    for an axisymmetric space - time with axial killing vector @xmath24 , ( [ div ] ) holds , while ( [ lie ] ) holds if @xmath16 respects the symmetry , @xmath146 , so the above construction , if unique as assumed , yields the correct axial vector .",
    "in particular , the construction does work for a kerr space - time , as described in appendix c.    to summarize this section , the definition ( [ am ] ) of angular momentum can be made generically unique if the axial vector is a coordinate vector , ( [ lie ] ) , and generates a symmetry of the area form , ( [ div ] ) .",
    "the construction can be applied in any situation where @xmath138 almost everywhere , though the physical interpretation as angular momentum seems to be safest in the case of two poles , which locate the axis of rotation . then @xmath3 is proposed to measure the angular momentum about that axis .",
    "the main result of this paper is that @xmath147 holds along a trapping horizon under the conditions ( [ div])([lie ] ) , where @xmath148 is thereby determined to be the transverse - normal block of the effective energy tensor for gravitational radiation .",
    "it can be shown by differentiating the angular momentum ( [ am ] ) using ( [ lie ] ) to give @xmath149 then expanding @xmath16 by ( [ xi ] ) and using the twisting equations ( [ twisting ] ) to express @xmath150 .",
    "the term in @xmath151 cancels with the first term from ( [ twisting ] ) , while the @xmath83 gradients may all be removed as total divergences due to ( [ dxi ] ) , ( [ div ] ) and the fact that ( [ con ] ) reduces to @xmath152 on a trapping horizon with @xmath153 .",
    "this leaves just @xmath154 which is an expanded form of ( [ amc ] ) , noting ( [ tau ] ) and thereby identifying ( [ theta2 ] ) .",
    "apart from the inclusion of @xmath17 , the conservation law ( [ amc ] ) is the standard surface - integral form of conservation of angular momentum , were @xmath24 an axial killing vector .",
    "it thereby describes the increase or decrease of angular momentum of a black hole due to infall of co - rotating or counter - rotating matter respectively .",
    "the corresponding volume - integral form for a spatial horizon @xmath31 , expressing the change @xmath155_{\\partial h}$ ] in @xmath3 between two marginal surfaces , follows as @xmath156_{\\partial h}\\cong-\\int_h{\\hat*}(t_{ab}+\\theta_{ab})\\psi^a\\hat\\tau^b \\label{amcv}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the unit normal vector and @xmath158 is the proper volume element .",
    "although more familiar , as for the energy conservation law @xcite , this form becomes degenerate as the horizon becomes null , since @xmath159 while @xmath160 ceases to exist . since this is a physically important limit , where a black hole is not growing , the surface - integral form ( [ amc ] ) is preferred .",
    "the null shears @xmath161 have previously been identified in the energy conservation law ( [ ec ] ) as encoding the ingoing and outgoing transverse gravitational radiation , via the energy densities ( [ theta0 ] ) , which agree with expressions in other limits , such as the bondi energy density at null infinity and the isaacson energy density of high - frequency linearized gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "so the expression ( [ theta2 ] ) implies that gravitational radiation with a transversely differential waveform will generally possess angular momentum density .",
    "one can see corresponding terms in the linearized approximation @xcite , but they are set to zero by the transverse - traceless gauge conditions , which are `` transverse '' in a different sense to that used here . in any case , the conservation law shows that a black hole can spin up or spin down even in vacuum , at a rate related to ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation .",
    "the identification of the transverse - normal block ( [ theta2 ] ) of @xmath17 appears to be new .",
    "previous versions of angular momentum flux laws for dynamical black holes @xcite contain different terms , which are not in energy - tensor form , i.e.  some tensor contracted with @xmath24 and @xmath20 .",
    "they can be recovered by removing a transverse divergence from @xmath162 , yielding @xmath163 , where @xmath164 encodes the shear along @xmath20 .",
    "such terms have been described by analogy with viscosity @xcite .",
    "the conservation laws ( [ ec ] ) and ( [ amc ] ) take a similar form , expressing rate of change of mass @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath3 as surface integrals of densities of energy and angular momentum , with respect to preferred vectors @xmath21 and @xmath24 which play the role of stationary and axial killing vectors , even if there are no symmetries .",
    "of the ten conservation laws in flat - space physics , they are the two independent laws expected for an astrophysical black hole , which defines its own spin axis and centre - of - mass frame , in which its momentum vanishes .",
    "for an electromagnetic field with charge - current density vector @xmath165 , the total electric charge @xmath1 in a region @xmath31 of a spatial hypersurface is defined as @xmath166_{\\partial h}=-\\int_h{\\hat*}g(j,\\hat\\tau ) .",
    "\\label{ccv}\\ ] ] the surface - integral form of conservation of charge follows by the same arguments relating ( [ amc ] ) and ( [ amcv ] ) : @xmath167 as before , this is more general , since @xmath31 may have any signature .",
    "the conservation laws for energy ( [ ec ] ) and angular momentum ( [ amc ] ) evidently take the same form @xmath168 by identifying current vectors @xmath169    the local differential form of charge conservation , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the covariant derivative of @xmath29 , notably does not hold for @xmath172 or @xmath173 in general . a weaker property holds , obtained as follows . first note that in any of the three conservation laws ( [ ec ] ) , ( [ amc ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) , @xmath16 and @xmath20 may be interchanged .",
    "thus there are really two independent laws in each case .",
    "this can be understood from special relativity : if @xmath16 were causal , one would interpret them as expressing rate of change of energy , angular momentum or charge as , respectively , power , torque or current ; while if @xmath16 were spatial , one would normally convert to volume - integral form and regard them as defining the energy , angular momentum or charge in a region .",
    "one can make either interpretation for a black hole , since @xmath31 would be generically spatial , but the marginal surfaces @xmath13 locate the black hole in a family of time slices .    given two independent equations in the normal space , it follows that @xmath174 expressed in terms of the curl and divergence of the normal space , @xmath175 whereas @xmath176 for any normal vector @xmath177",
    ". then @xmath178 yields @xmath179 this subtly confirms the view that energy and angular momentum in general relativity can not be localized @xcite , but might be quasi - localized , as surface integrals @xcite .",
    "the corresponding conservation laws have indeed been obtained in surface - integral but not local form .",
    "there are now three conserved quantities @xmath180 , forming a state space for dynamical black holes . following various authors @xcite , related quantities",
    "may then be defined by formulas satisfied by kerr - newman black holes , specifically those for the adm energy @xmath181 the surface gravity @xmath182 the angular speed @xmath183 and the electric potential @xmath184 it would be preferable to have independently motivated definitions of these quantities , but so far this has been done only in spherical symmetry @xcite , where there are natural definitions of @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath185 which can be applied anywhere in the space - time , coinciding with the above expressions on the outer horizons of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .    in the dynamical context , @xmath186 is generally not the adm energy , since there may be matter or gravitational radiation outside the black hole .",
    "rather , it can be interpreted as the effective energy of the black hole , as follows . defining the moment of inertia @xmath187 by the usual formula @xmath188 yields @xmath189 expanding @xmath9 for @xmath190 and @xmath191 yields @xmath192",
    "the second and third terms are standard expressions for rotational kinetic energy and electrostatic energy .",
    "thus the irreducible mass @xmath0 plays the role of a rest mass , with @xmath9 including contributions from rotational and electrical energy .",
    "returning to the general case , the above definitions satisfy the state - space formulas @xmath193 there follows a dynamic version of the so - called first law of black - hole mechanics @xcite : @xmath194 as desired , the state - space perturbations in the classical law for killing horizons @xcite , or the version for isolated horizons @xcite , have been replaced by the derivatives along the trapping horizon , thereby promoting it to a genuine dynamical law .",
    "the rate of change of effective energy can also be written in energy - tensor form , @xmath195 where @xmath196 plays the role of the stationary killing vector .",
    "note that in the classical theory of stationary black holes , the state variables are usually taken to be @xmath197 , with the irreducible mass @xmath0 defined as a dependent variable .",
    "the dynamical theory reveals that @xmath180 are the more basic variables , since they each satisfy a simple conservation law .",
    "then the effective energy @xmath9 is defined as a dependent variable and therefore satisfies the above conservation law .",
    "this reflects a shift in emphasis from the classical to the dynamical theory : the so - called first law is a dependent result , obtained from more fundamental conservation laws for energy , angular momentum and charge .",
    "a zeroth law for trapping horizons follows from the above , if one defines local equilibrium by the absence of relevant fluxes : @xmath198 then @xmath180 are constant on the horizon and so is @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , these conditions do hold on a null trapping horizon under the dominant energy condition , as shown below .",
    "this treatment also turns out to be compatible with the definition of weakly isolated horizon @xcite .",
    "consider a null trapping horizon , assumed henceforth in this section to be given by @xmath199 .",
    "the null focussing equation yields @xmath200 , so the null energy condition , which implies @xmath201 , yields @xcite @xmath202 thus the degenerate metric of the horizon is preserved along the generating vector . the dominant energy condition , which implies that the energy - momentum @xmath203 is causal , further yields @xcite @xmath204 since @xmath205 would otherwise be spatial .    on a null hypersurface @xmath31 , one can take the null coordinate to be the generating coordinate , @xmath206 , meaning that the shift vector vanishes , @xmath207 , so that @xmath208 . since @xmath209 ( [ time ] ) , one finds @xmath210 these fluxes vanish by the above results ( [ ed])([amd ] ) and the expressions ( [ theta0 ] ) , ( [ theta2 ] ) for components of @xmath17 .",
    "the other flux in ( [ 0th ] ) vanishes due to the maxwell equations @xcite .    for a null trapping horizon ,",
    "the dual - null foliation is not unique , so the question arises whether there is a natural way to fix it . an affirmative answer is given by noting that the above results also imply , via the twisting equations ( [ twisting ] ) , @xmath211 this restriction on the dual - null geometry is suggestive of a proto - conservation law for angular momentum .",
    "now the only normal fundamental form intrinsic to a null hypersurface is @xmath212 of appendix b , which was therefore used by ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite to define angular momentum for an isolated horizon .",
    "however , it is the other null normal fundamental form @xmath213 , depending on the dual - null foliation , which is preserved as above . given that the general definition ( [ am ] ) of angular momentum involves @xmath26 , it seems best to fix the unwanted freedom by @xmath214 recalling the definition ( [ ff ] ) or ( [ ls ] ) of @xmath58 , this condition fixes the normalization of the extrinsic null normal @xmath215 with respect to the intrinsic null normal @xmath216 , which is always possible on a null hypersurface @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , it is common simply to fix @xmath217 .",
    "a similar normalization is also used in the context of null infinity .    then the definition ( [ am ] ) of angular momentum becomes unambiguous on a null trapping horizon , coincides with the definition for isolated horizons @xcite , and is preserved along the horizon , assuming only that @xmath24 is a coordinate vector field ( [ lie ] ) : @xmath218 since the area law @xcite shows that @xmath2 is increasing unless @xmath31 is null everywhere on a given @xmath13 , this answers , in the negative , a simply stated physical question : whether a black hole can change its angular momentum without increasing its area .",
    "the above reasoning has largely recovered the notion of a weakly isolated horizon introduced by ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite , except that the scaling freedom in @xmath216 has not been fixed . in more detail ,",
    "ashtekar et al.@xcite introduced a 1-form which will here be denoted by @xmath219 , defined by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the covariant derivative operator of @xmath31 .",
    "the transverse and normal components are found as @xmath222 since @xmath219 is an invariant of @xmath31 and @xmath216 , ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite demanded @xmath223 in order to define a weakly isolated horizon .",
    "the transverse part agrees with the above results , which also imply @xmath224 , while the normal part further fixes the inaffinity @xmath225 to be constant on @xmath31 .",
    "this fixes the scaling of @xmath216 up to a constant multiple .",
    "ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite defined the surface gravity to be @xmath226 which recovers the standard surface gravity of a killing horizon if @xmath216 is the null killing vector @xcite .",
    "then the constancy of @xmath227 can also be interpreted as a zeroth law .",
    "this still leaves non - zero @xmath227 ambiguous up to a constant multiple , not necessarily agreeing with the definition ( [ sg ] ) , which therefore fixes that freedom .",
    "the above considerations appear to have a closed a gap in the general paradigm , concerning how a growing black hole ceases to grow .",
    "it seems that the generically spatial trapping horizon simply becomes null .",
    "it is difficult to find a practical formalism describing all cases without some degeneracy arising in the null case , but the dual - null formalism appears to be adequate ; one fixes the additional freedom in the null case by ( [ fix ] ) .",
    "in particular , no additional conditions need be imposed on the horizon itself , as compared with the variety of definitions of isolated horizons @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence that such horizons exist in practice has been given by dreyer et al .",
    "@xcite , who looked for and found approximately null trapping horizons , under the name non - expanding horizons .    research supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grants 10375081 and 10473007 and by shanghai normal university under grant pl609 .",
    "thanks to abhay ashtekar , ivan booth , eric gourgoulhon and badri krishnan for discussions .",
    "the twist may be calculated by first finding the shift vectors @xmath228 , due to the form @xcite @xmath229-[\\partial_-,s_+]+[s_-,s_+]\\right).\\ ] ] if it is more convenient to use an orthonormal basis @xmath230 of the normal space , @xmath231 then @xmath232\\right)\\ ] ] follows by linear combinations from ( [ am ] ) , or directly from the komar integral ( [ komar ] ) .",
    "if the basis is adapted to a coordinate basis via @xmath233 then @xmath234-[\\partial_0,s_1]+[s_0,s_1]\\right).\\ ] ] in either case , the first step is to find the shift vectors .",
    "the weak - field metric @xcite , in standard spherical polar coordinates @xmath235 adapted to the axis of rotation , is @xmath236 where , in this appendix only , @xmath0 and @xmath3 denote the mass and angular momentum as defined in this approximation , obtained by linearizing the metric and neglecting higher powers of @xmath237 .",
    "the inverse metric is @xmath238 taking the transverse surfaces @xmath13 as those of constant @xmath239 , one can read off the nonzero component of the shift 1-forms @xmath240 as @xmath241 then the non - zero component of the twist is given by @xmath242 the area form is @xmath243 so that @xmath244 standard integrals yield @xmath245 since @xmath246 if @xmath132 , this agrees with the general definition ( [ am ] ) of angular momentum .    a directly measurable quantity due to rotational frame - dragging is the precessional angular velocity @xcite @xmath247 of a gyroscope due to the lense - thirring effect , where @xmath248 is a unit vector in the direction of the gyroscope and @xmath249 is a unit vector along the axis of rotation",
    "results of measurements of the effect due to the earth by gravity probe b are expected soon .",
    "if the twist @xmath26 is formally converted to an angular velocity @xmath250 by @xmath251 then @xmath252 does have the direction and relativistic dimensions of angular velocity . then @xmath253 curiously , this is a linear transformation of @xmath250 , by the same traceless tensor used in defining quadrupole moments @xcite .",
    "the puckish role of the factor of 3 in the above calculations is also noteworthy . in any case",
    ", it confirms that the twist does indeed encode the twisting around of space - time due to a rotating mass , in a directly measurable way .    for completeness",
    ", the agreement of the weak - field mass with the hawking mass can also be checked , as follows .",
    "one needs to keep track of an extra power of @xmath237 in the area form @xmath254 then the expansion 1-form @xmath255 has non - zero component @xmath256 then @xmath257 and @xmath258 since @xmath259 , this agrees with the hawking mass ( [ hm ] ) .",
    "various definitions of angular momentum @xcite are similar to ( [ am ] ) , with @xmath26 replaced by a 1-form which is , implicitly or explicitly , a normal fundamental form .",
    "to clarify the situation , normal fundamental forms are reviewed below , referring to previous treatments @xcite .",
    "writing the twist ( [ tw ] ) explicitly in components , @xmath260 if @xmath71 are adapted to a coordinate basis via ( [ nn ] ) , then commutativity @xmath261}x^\\pm=0 $ ] allows it to be written as @xmath262 this is the difference of two normal fundamental forms @xmath263 with components @xmath264 they are the independent normal fundamental forms , since the corresponding @xmath265 vanish .",
    "their sum is @xmath266 , since the normalization in ( [ ls ] ) yields @xmath267 then @xmath268 and the normal fundamental forms are thereby encoded in @xmath26 and @xmath266 .    for an orthonormal basis ( [ ob ] ) , there is just one independent normal fundamental form @xmath269 , given by @xmath270 with corresponding @xmath271 , @xmath272 vanishing . under a boost transformation @xmath273 which preserves the orthonormal conditions ( [ ob ] ) ,",
    "the normal fundamental form is generally not invariant : @xmath274 however , if the orthonormal basis is adapted to the dual - null basis by , e.g.@xmath275 , then @xmath276 for spatial @xmath31 , the same result is obtained by adapting the orthonormal basis by choosing @xmath277 the missing information in @xmath266 can be recovered by instead defining @xmath278 then @xmath279 these 1-forms nevertheless become degenerate when @xmath16 becomes null .    as shown explicitly by gourgoulhon @xcite ,",
    "the 1-form used by brown & york @xcite to define angular momentum is , in this notation , @xmath280 .",
    "therefore it coincides with @xmath26 if the orthonormal basis is adapted to a trapping horizon , but generally not if it is adapted to a foliation of spatial hypersurfaces intersecting the trapping horizon in the marginal surfaces .",
    "the 1-form used by ashtekar & krishnan @xcite to define angular momentum for dynamical horizons is also @xmath280 , this time explicitly adapted to the horizon by ( [ aon ] ) , therefore coinciding with @xmath26 in this case .",
    "the 1-form used by ashtekar et al.@xcite to define angular momentum for isolated horizons is @xmath281 , which generally does not coincide with @xmath26 .",
    "however , it does coincide if the gauge freedom is fixed by ( [ fix ] ) .",
    "consider a kerr space - time in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath235 , with @xmath13 given by constant @xmath239 and @xmath282 .",
    "then @xmath283 where @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 if @xmath287 , @xmath288 is non - zero except at the poles , equator and isolated values of @xmath289 , so the construction yields a unique continuous @xmath24 , @xmath132 .",
