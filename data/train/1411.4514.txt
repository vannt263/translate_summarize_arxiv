    "the harmonic oscillator plays the central role in classical and modern science , starting from elementary pendulum in xvii century , when ideas of johannes kepler signify important intermediate step between previous magic - symbolical and modern quantitative - mathematical description of nature @xcite . at that time",
    "the birth of classical physics was caused by application of an abstract idea of periodicity to concrete variety of problems @xcite .",
    "wave theory and fourier series are some tools developed from this concept in classical physics . but only in modern science we observe essentially new qualitative transition from dynamics to the oscillation theory .",
    "it was emphasized by l. mandelstam in lectures on oscillation theory @xcite , that the difference between standard dynamics and the oscillation theory is that in dynamics we are interested in description of what is going on in a given place at a given time . while in the oscillation theory - in the motion of the system as a whole . in classical mechanical picture of the world ,",
    "positions and velocities are primary objects , while oscillations are the secondary ones . however , starting from quantum mechanics , in which our knowledge of simultaneous positions and velocities is restricted by the heisenberg uncertainty relations , this point of view has been drastically changed .",
    "the wave mechanics affirms that the wholeness of the quantum process is something of the same primacy as position of a particle . and every particle is associated with some stationary oscillation process .",
    "essential to note that knowledge of phase of the particle and knowledge of the stationary state are excluding each other .",
    "the phase of the particle ( trajectory ) in a single stationary state does not exist , since any attempt to derive this phase switches the system to another stationary state @xcite . this way the basic characteristic of oscillation theory , as a consideration of the process as a whole , becomes underlie of fundamental questions of mechanics in quantum world .",
    "this point of view also influenced the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems , studying the qualitative behavior of a system in the phase space , its integrability properties and chaos @xcite .    in recent development of quantum",
    "integrable systems the concept of quantum group as a deformation of the lie group with deformation parameter @xmath0 was discovered .",
    "the notion of quantum @xmath0-oscillator as a @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator was introduced in studies on quantum heisenberg - weyl group @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this oscillator is related with so called symmetric @xmath0-calculus @xcite , while another version of @xmath0-oscillator @xcite , @xcite with non - symmetric @xmath0-calculus .",
    "the difference is in definition of @xmath0-number and several generalizations of these numbers and oscillators with different basis were found . in the large stream of articles devoted to @xmath0-oscillator here we like to emphasize the set of papers published by v. i. manko and coauthors , which are not widely known @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in these papers",
    "the physical approach to q - oscillator as a nonlinear oscillator was developed .",
    "it was shown that it is an oscillator with frequency depending on its energy in the form of hyperbolic cosine function of the energy .",
    "the classical motion of this nonlinear oscillator becomes descriptive of the motion of a q - oscillator and the frequency of oscillations is increasing exponentially with energy . by standard quantization of this nonlinear system",
    ", the authors got a quantum q - oscillator as a nonlinear quantum oscillator with anharmonicity described by power series in energy .",
    "then they generalized the approach to an arbitrary energy dependence of frequency and called it as the @xmath1-oscillator .",
    "in fact , in addition to frequency , any constant parameters in some exactly solvable system can be replaced by integrals of motion .",
    "this idea in some sense continues dirac s approach to fundamental constants as a simple functions slowly varying in time .",
    "the slow variation of parameters can be implemented by adiabatic invariants and integrals of motion , with corresponding quantization .",
    "then starting from any integrable system one can replace parameters of the system by integrals of motion and get the hierarchy of integrable systems from the given one .    in the present paper",
    "we develop several ideas as a variations on such approach to @xmath0- and @xmath1-oscillators as the main theme . in section 2",
    "we show that an arbitrary one dimensional integrable model in action - angle variables has natural description as a classical and quantum @xmath1-oscillator . as an example we consider semi - relativistic oscillator , related with landau levels for relativistic electron in magnetic field . in section 3",
    "we review some results on symmetric @xmath0-oscillator and in the next section 4 we study linear q - schrodinger equation with dispersion relation of this oscillator .",
    "the symmetry operators and polynomial solutions with moving zeros are described , as well as nonlinearization of the model by complex cole - hopf - madelung transformation .",
    "the symmetry of the linear equation then is rewritten as bcklund transformation for the nonlinear q - burgers equation . in section 6 ,",
    "following the general procedure developed in @xcite , we construct the nonlinear schrdinger equation with symmetric @xmath0-dispersion .",
    "this q - nls equation is an integrable model from nls hierarchy with lax representation , infinite number of integrals of motion , soliton solutions etc . in the limit @xmath3",
    "it reduces to nls , which is one of the universal soliton equations and for @xmath4 provide higher order corrections in dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "peculiar property of the model is to be completely integrable at any order of expansion in deformation parameter around @xmath2 . as a next variation on q - calculus application in section 4 we consider hydrodynamic flow in bounded circular wedge domain .",
    "we formulate general two circular wedge theorem and show that the flow is determined by q - periodic functions . for real @xmath5",
    "it is the flow in annular concentric circles domain , while for wedge with angle @xmath6 , @xmath0 is the primitive root of unity . for a vortex problem in such domains",
    "we describe full set of vortex images as a kaleidoscope in terms of @xmath0-elementary functions . as an application we describe the point vortex motion in annular domain as a nonlinear oscillator with frequency depending on radius of motion .",
    "then we find the @xmath1-oscillator form of this model and discuss corresponding quantization . in the last section 10 by introducing matrix form of binet formula for fibonacci numbers , we solve so called golden oscillator and find corresponding coherent states and fock - bargman type representation .",
    "details of some proofs are given in appendix .",
    "i apologize that in this paper would be not able to give complete list of references in this very wide field of research . instead of this",
    "i try to represent some basic ideas in a pedagogical way .",
    "representation of an integrable model by the action - angle variables allows one to interpret the model as a set of nonlinear oscillators . for simplicity here we illustrate the idea only for the one degree of freedom hamiltonian system . due to conservation of energy",

    "quantization of action - angle variables implies that the action variable @xmath14 is replaced by hermitian operator @xmath29 , while instead of @xmath15 one should use the unitary operator @xmath30 @xcite , @xcite .",
