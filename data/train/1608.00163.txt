    "the science of networks is a modern discipline spanning the natural , social and computer sciences , as well as engineering  @xcite .",
    "networks , or graphs , consist of _ vertices _ and _ edges_. an edge typically connects a pair of vertices .",
    "networks occur in an huge variety of contexts .",
    "facebook , for instance , is a large social network , where more than one billion people are connected via virtual acquaintanceships .",
    "another famous example is the internet , the physical network of computers , routers and modems which are linked via cables or wireless signals ( fig .",
    "[ figgennet ] ) .",
    "many other examples come from biology , physics , economics , engineering , computer science , ecology , marketing , social and political sciences , etc ..    most networks of interest display _ community structure _ , i. e. , their vertices are organised into groups , called _ communities _ , _ clusters _ or _ modules_. in fig .",
    "[ figsfi ] we show a collaboration network of scientists working at the santa fe institute ( sfi ) in santa fe , new mexico .",
    "vertices are scientists , edges join coauthors .",
    "edges are concentrated within groups of vertices representing scientists working on the same research topic , where collaborations are more natural .",
    "likewise , communities could represent proteins with similar function in protein - protein interaction networks , groups of friends in social networks , websites on similar topics on the web graph , and so on .",
    "identifying communities may offer insight on how the network is organised .",
    "it allows us to focus on regions having some degree of autonomy within the graph .",
    "it helps to classify the vertices , based on their role with respect to the communities they belong to .",
    "for instance we can distinguish vertices totally embedded within their clusters from vertices at the boundary of the clusters , which may act as brokers between the modules and , in that case , could play a major role both in holding the modules together and in the dynamics of spreading processes across the network .",
    "community detection in networks , also called _ graph _ or _ network clustering _ , is an ill - defined problem though .",
    "there is no universal definition of the objects that one should be looking for .",
    "consequently , there are no clear - cut guidelines on how to assess the performance of different algorithms and how to compare them with each other . on the one hand , such ambiguity leaves a lot of freedom to propose diverse approaches to the problem , which often depend on the specific research question and ( or ) the particular system at study . on the other hand , it has introduced a lot of noise into the field , slowing down progress . in particular , it has favoured the diffusion of questionable concepts and convictions , on which a large number of methods are based .",
    "this work presents a critical analysis of the problem of community detection , intended to practitioners but accessible to readers with basic notions of network science .",
    "it is not meant to be an exhaustive survey .",
    "the focus is on the general aspects of the problem , especially in the light of recent findings .",
    "also , we discuss some popular classes of algorithms and give advice on their usage . more info on network clustering can be found in several review articles  @xcite .",
    "the contents are organised in three main sections .",
    "section  [ sec - comm ] deals with the concept of community , describing its evolution from the classic subgraph - based notions to the modern statistical interpretation .",
    "next we discuss the critical issue of validation ( section  [ sec - valid ] ) , emphasising the role of artificial benchmarks , the importance of the choice of partition similarity scores , the conditions under which clusters are detectable , the usefulness of metadata and the structural peculiarities of communities in real networks .",
    "section  [ sec - meth ] hosts a critical discussion of some popular clustering approaches .",
    "it also tackles important general methodological aspects , such as the determination of the number of clusters , which is a necessary input for several techniques , the possibility to generate robust solutions by combining multiple partitions , the main approaches to discover dynamic communities , as well as the assessment of the significance of clusterings . in section",
    "[ sec - soft ] we indicate where to find useful software .",
    "the concluding remarks of section  [ sec - ol ] close the work .",
    "we start with a subgraph @xmath0 of a graph @xmath1 .",
    "the number of vertices and edges are @xmath2 , @xmath3 for @xmath1 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 for @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the adjacency matrix of @xmath6 is @xmath7 , its element @xmath8 equals @xmath9 if vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are neighbours , otherwise it equals @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the subgraph is connected because communities usually are .",
    "other types of group structures do not require connectedness ( section  [ sec - mv ] ) .",
    "the subgraph is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figstruct ] .",
    "its vertices are enclosed by the dashed contour .",
    "the magenta dots are the external vertices connected to the subgraph , while the black ones are the remaining vertices of the network .",
    "the blue lines indicate the edges connecting the subgraph to the rest of the network .    the _ internal _ and _ external _ degree @xmath13 and @xmath14 of a vertex @xmath10 of the network with respect to subgraph @xmath0 are the number of edges connecting @xmath10 to vertices of @xmath0 and to the rest of the graph , respectively .",
    "both definitions can be expressed in compact form via the adjacency matrix @xmath7 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the sums run over all vertices @xmath11 inside and outside @xmath17 , respectively . naturally , the degree @xmath18 of @xmath10 is the sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath19 .",

    "now we present a number of variables related to the subgraph as a whole .",
    "we distinguish them in three classes .",
    "the first class comprises measures based on internal connectedness , i. e. , on how cohesive the subgraph is .",
    "the main variables are :    * _ internal degree _ @xmath30 .",
    "the sum of the internal degrees of the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "it equals twice the number @xmath5 of internal edges , as each edge contributes two units of degree . in matrix form , @xmath31",
    "* _ average internal degree _ @xmath32 .",
    "average degree of vertices of @xmath0 , considering only internal edges : @xmath33 . *",
    "_ internal edge density _ @xmath34 .",
    "the ratio between the number of internal edges of @xmath0 and the number of all possible internal edges : @xmath35 we remark that @xmath36 is the maximum number of internal edges that a simple graph with @xmath4 vertices may have .",
    "the second class includes measures based on external connectedness , i. e. , on how embedded the subgraph is in the network or , equivalently , how separated the subgraph is from it .",
    "the main variables are :    * _ external degree _ , or _ cut _ , @xmath37 .",
    "the sum of the external degrees of the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "it gives the number of external edges of the subgraph ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ figstruct ] ) . in matrix form , @xmath38 . * _ average external degree _ , or _ expansion _ , @xmath39 .",
    "average degree of vertices of @xmath0 , considering only external edges : @xmath40 . *",
    "_ external edge density _ , or _ cut ratio _ , @xmath41 .",
    "the ratio between the number of external edges of @xmath0 and the number of all possible external edges : @xmath42    finally , we have hybrid measures , combining internal and external connectedness .",
    "notable examples are :    * _ total degree _ , or _",
    "volume _ , @xmath43 .",
    "the sum of the degrees of the vertices of @xmath0 . naturally , @xmath44 . in matrix form , @xmath45 . * _ average degree _ @xmath46 .",
    "average degree of vertices of @xmath0 : @xmath47 . *",
    "_ conductance _ @xmath48 .",
    "the ratio between the external degree and the total degree of @xmath0 : @xmath49    all definitions we have given hold for the case of undirected and unweighted networks .",
    "the extension to weighted graphs is straightforward , as it suffices to replace the  number of edges \" with the sum of the weights carried by every edge .",
    "for instance , the internal degree @xmath50 of a vertex @xmath51 becomes the _ internal strength _",
    "@xmath52 , which is the sum of the weights of the edges joining @xmath51 with the vertices of subgraph @xmath17 . for the internal and external edge densities of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) one would have to replace the numerators with their weighted counterparts and multiply the denominators by the average edge weight @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the element of the _ weight matrix _",
    ", indicating the weight of the edge joining vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath55 if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are disconnected ) and @xmath3 the total number of graph edges . in tables",
    "[ tab : metricsv ] and [ tab : metrics ] we list all variables we have presented along with their extensions to the case of weighted networks . in directed networks",
    "one would have to distinguish between incoming and outgoing edges .",
    "extensions of the metrics are fairly simple to implement , though their usefulness is unclear .",
    "figure  [ figcom ] shows how scholars usually envision community structure .",
    "the network has three clusters and in each cluster the density of edges is comparatively higher than the density of edges between the clusters .",
    "this can be summarised by saying that communities are dense subgraphs which are well separated from each other .",
    "this view has been challenged , recently  @xcite , as we shall see in section  [ ncp ] .",
    "communities may overlap as well , sharing some of the vertices .",
    "for instance , in social networks individuals can belong to different circles at the same time , like family , friends , work colleagues .",
    "figure  [ figoverl ] shows an example of a network with overlapping communities .",
    "communities are typically supposed to be overlapping at their boundaries , as in the figure .",
    "recent results reveal a different picture , though  @xcite ( section  [ ncp ] ) . a subdivision of a network into overlapping communities",
    "is called _ cover _ and one speaks of _ soft clustering _ , as opposed to _ hard clustering _ , which deals with divisions into non - overlapping groups , called",
    "_ partitions_. the generic term _ clustering _ can be used to indicate both types of subdivisions .",
    "covers can be _ crisp _ , when shared vertices belong to their communities with equal strength , or _ fuzzy _",
    ", when the strength of their membership can be different in different clusters .",
    "the oldest definitions of community - like objects were proposed by social network analysts and focused on the internal cohesion among vertices of a subgraph  @xcite .",
    "the most popular concept is that of _ clique _  @xcite .",
    "a clique is a _ complete graph _ , that is , a subgraph such that each of its vertices is connected to all the others .",
    "it is also a maximal subgraph , meaning that it is not included in a larger complete subgraph . in modern network science",
    "it is common to call clique any complete graph , not necessarily maximal .",
    "triangles are the simplest cliques .",
    "finding cliques is an * np*-complete problem  @xcite ; a popular technique is the bron ",
    "kerbosch method  @xcite .",
    "the notion of cliques , albeit useful , can not be considered a good candidate for a community definition .",
    "while a clique has the largest possible internal edge density , as all internal edges are present , communities are not complete graphs , in general .",
    "moreover , all vertices have identical role in a clique , while in real network communities some vertices are more important than others , due to their heterogeneous linking patterns .",
    "therefore , in social network analysis the notion has been relaxed , generating the related concepts of _ n - cliques _",
    "@xcite , _ n - clans _ and _ n - clubs _  @xcite .",
    "other definitions are based on the idea that a vertex must be adjacent to some minimum number of other vertices in the subgraph .",
    "@xmath56-plex _ is a maximal subgraph in which each vertex is adjacent to all other vertices of the subgraph except at most @xmath56 of them  @xcite .",
    "details on the above definitions can be found in specialised books  @xcite .    for a proper community definition",
    ", one should take into account both the internal cohesion of the candidate subgraph and its separation from the rest of the network .",
    "a simple idea that has received a great popularity is that a community is a subgraph such that  the number of internal edges is larger than the number of external edges \" .",
    "this idea has inspired the following definitions .",
    "an _ @xmath57-set",
    "_  @xcite , or _ strong community _",
    "@xcite , is a subgraph such that the internal degree of each vertex is greater than its external degree .",
    "a relaxed condition is that the internal degree of the subgraph exceeds its external degree [ _ weak community _",
    "@xcite ] to be a weak community it is not necessary that the number of internal edges @xmath5 exceeds that of external edges @xmath37 . since the internal degree @xmath58 ( section  [ sec - var ] ) the actual condition is @xmath59 . ] .",
    "a strong community is also a weak community , while the converse is not generally true .",
    "a drawback of these definitions is that one separates the subgraph at study from the rest of the network , which is taken as a single object .",
    "but the latter can be in turn divided into communities .",
    "if a subgraph @xmath0 is a proper community , it makes sense that each of its vertices is more strongly attached to the vertices of @xmath0 than to the vertices of any other subgraph .",
    "this concept , proposed by hu et al .",
    "@xcite , is more in line ( though not entirely ) with the modern idea of community that we discuss in the following section .",
    "it has generated two alternative definitions of strong and weak community .",
    "a subgraph @xmath0 is a strong community if the internal degree of any vertex within @xmath0 exceeds the internal degree of the vertex within any other subgraph , i. e. , the number of edges joining the vertex to those of the subgraph ; likewise , a community is weak if its internal degree exceeds the ( total ) internal degree of its vertices within every other community . a strong ( weak ) community  la radicchi et al .",
    "is a strong ( weak ) community also in the sense of hu",
    "et al .. the opposite is not true , in general ( fig .",
    "[ figsw ] ) .",
    "in particular , a subgraph can be a strong community in the sense of hu et al . even though all of its vertices have internal degree smaller than their respective external degree .",
    "the above definitions of communities use _ extensive _ variables : their value tends to be the larger , the bigger the community ( e. g. , the internal and external degrees ) .",
    "but there are also variables discounting community size .",
    "an example is the internal cluster density @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "one could assume that a subgraph @xmath0 with @xmath56 vertices is a cluster if @xmath60 is larger than a threshold @xmath61 .",
    "setting the size of the subgraph is necessary because otherwise any clique would be among the best possible communities , including trivial two - cliques ( simple edges ) or triangles .      as we have seen in the previous section , traditional definitions of community",
    "rely on counting edges ( internal , external ) , in various ways .",
    "but what one should be really focusing on is the _ probability _ that vertices share edges with a subgraph .",
    "the existence of communities implies that vertices interact more strongly with the other members of their community than they do with vertices of the other communities .",
    "consequently , there is a preferential linking pattern between vertices of the same group .",
    "this is the reason why edge densities end up being higher within communities than between them .",
    "we can formulate that by saying that vertices of the same community have a higher probability to form edges with their partners than with the other vertices .",
    "let us suppose that we estimated the edge probabilities between all pairs of vertices , somehow .",
    "we can define the groups by means of those probabilities .",
    "it is a scenario similar to the classic one we have seen in section  [ sec - defs ] , where we add and compare probabilities , instead of edges .",
    "natural definitions of strong and weak community are :    * a _ strong community _ is a subgraph each of whose vertices has a higher probability to be linked to every vertex of the subgraph than to any other vertex of the graph . * a _ weak community _ is a subgraph such that the average edge probability of each vertex with the other members of the group exceeds the average edge probability of the vertex with the vertices of any other group . ] .",
    "the difference between the two definitions is that , in the concept of strong community , the inequality between edge probabilities holds at the level of every pair of vertices , while in the concept of weak community the inequality holds only for averages over groups .",
    "therefore , a strong community is also a weak community , but the opposite is not true , in general .",
    "now we can see why the former definitions of strong and weak community  @xcite are not satisfactory .",
    "suppose to have a network with two subgraphs @xmath7 and @xmath62 of very different sizes , say with @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices ( fig .",
    "[ figexsw ] ) .     and @xmath62 and edge probabilities @xmath65 between vertices of the subgraphs and @xmath66 between vertices of @xmath7 and @xmath62 .",
    "the red circle is a representative vertex of subgraph @xmath7 , the smaller blue circle represents the rest of the vertices of @xmath7 .",
    "the subgraphs are both strong and weak communities in the probabilistic sense , but they may be neither strong nor weak communities according to the classic definitions by radicchi et al .",
    "@xcite and hu et al .",
    "@xcite , if @xmath62 is sufficiently larger than @xmath7 . ]",
    "the network is generated by a model where the edge probability is @xmath65 between vertices of the same group and @xmath67 for vertices of different groups .",
    "the two subgraphs are communities both in the strong and in the weak sense , according to the probability - based definitions above .",
    "the expected internal degree of a vertex of @xmath7 is @xmath68 : since there are @xmath63 possible internal neighbours , but for simplicity one allows for the formation of self - edges , from a vertex to itself .",
    "results obtained with and without self - edges are basically undistinguishable , when community sizes are much larger than one .",
    "we shall stick to this setup throughout the paper . ] .",
    "likewise , the expected external degree of a vertex of @xmath7 is @xmath69 .",
    "the expected internal and external degrees of @xmath7 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for any two values of @xmath65 and @xmath67 one can always choose @xmath72 sufficiently larger than @xmath63 that @xmath73 , which also implies that @xmath74 .",
    "in this setting the subgraphs are neither strong nor weak communities , according to the definitions proposed by radicchi et al . and",
    "hu et al ..    how can we compute the edge probabilities between vertices ? this is still an ill - defined problem , unless one has a model stating how edges are formed .",
    "one can make many hypotheses on the process of edge formation .",
    "+    for instance , if we take social networks , we can assume that the probability that two individuals know each other is a decreasing function of their geographical distance , on average  @xcite .",
    "each set of assumptions defines a model . for our purposes",
    ", eligible models should take into account the possible presence of groups of vertices , that behave similarly .",
    "the most famous model of networks with group structure is the _",
    "stochastic block model _ ( sbm )",
    "suppose we have a network with @xmath2 vertices , divided in @xmath75 groups .",
    "the group of vertex @xmath10 is indicated with the integer label @xmath76 .",
    "the idea of the model is very simple : the probability @xmath77 that vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected depends exclusively on their group memberships : @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , it is identical for any @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the same groups .",
    "the probabilities @xmath79 form a @xmath80 symmetric matrix , called the _",
    "stochastic block matrix_. the diagonal elements @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) of the stochastic block matrix are the probabilities that vertices of block @xmath56 are neighbours , whereas the off - diagonal elements give the edge probabilities between different blocks between blocks @xmath83 and @xmath84 is fixed ( @xmath85 ) , instead of the edge probabilities . if @xmath86 the two models are fully equivalent if the edge probabilities @xmath87 are chosen such that the expected number of edges running between @xmath83 and @xmath84 coincides with @xmath88 . ] .    for @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , we recover community structure , as the probabilities that vertices of the same group are connected exceed the probabilities that vertices of different groups are joined ( fig .  [",
    "fig : stylized - hotdog ] ) .",
    "it is also called _ assortative structure _ , as it privileges bonds between vertices of the same group .",
    "the model is very versatile , though , and can generate various types of group structure . for @xmath91 , with @xmath90 , we have _ disassortative structure _ , as edges are more likely between the blocks than inside them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stylized - bipartite ] ) . in the special case in which @xmath92 we recover _ multipartite structure _ , as there are edges only between the blocks . if @xmath93 , @xmath94 , we have _ core - periphery structure _ : the vertices of the first block ( core ) are relatively well - connected amongst themselves as well as to a peripheral set of vertices that interact very little amongst themselves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stylized - coreper ] ) .",
    "if all probabilities are equal , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , we recover the classic random graph  la erds and rnyi  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stylized - random ] ) . here",
    "any two vertices have identical probability of being connected , hence there is no group structure .",
    "this has become a fundamental axiom in community detection , and has inspired some popular techniques like , e. g. , modularity optimisation  @xcite ( section  [ sec - modopt ] ) .",
    "random graphs of this type are also useful in the validation of clustering algorithms ( section  [ art - bench ] ) .",
    "alternative community definitions are based on the interplay between network topology and dynamics .",
    "diffusion is the most used dynamics .",
    "random walks are the simplest diffusion processes .",
    "a simple random walk is a path such that the vertex reached at step @xmath97 is a random neighbour of the vertex reached at step @xmath98 .",
    "a random walker would be spending a long time within communities , due to the supposedly low number of routes taking out of them  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of random walks does not depend solely on the number or density of edges , in general , but also on the structure and distribution of paths formed by consecutive edges , as paths are the routes that walkers can follow .",
    "this means that random walk dynamics relies on _ higher - order structures _ than simple edges , in general .",
    "such relationship is even more pronounced when one considers markov dynamics of second order or higher , in which the probability of reaching a vertex at step @xmath99 of the walk does not depend only on where the walker sits at step @xmath97 , but also on where it was at step @xmath98 and possibly earlier  @xcite .",
    "indeed , one could formulate the network clustering problem by focusing on higher order structures , like _ motifs _",
    "( e. g. , triangles )  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that one can preserve more complex features of the network and its communities , which typically get lost when one uses network models solely based on edge probabilities , like sbms .",
    "the drawback is that calculations become more involved and lengthy .",
    "is a definition of community really necessary ? actually not , most techniques to detect communities in networks do not require a precise definition of community .",
    "the problem can be attacked from many angles .",
    "for instance , one can remove the edges separating the clusters from each other , that can be identified via some particular feature  @xcite . but",
    "defining clusters beforehand is a useful starting point , that allows one to check the reliability of the final results .",
    "in this section we will discuss the crucial issue of validation of clustering algorithms .",
    "validation usually means checking how precisely algorithms can recover the communities in benchmark networks , whose community structure is known .",
    "benchmarks can be computer - generated , according to some model , or actual networks , whose group structure is supposed to be known via non - topological features ( metadata ) . the lack of a universal definition of communities makes the search for benchmarks rather arbitrary , in principle .",
    "nevertheless , the best known artificial benchmarks are based on the modern definition of clusters presented in section  [ sec - mv ] .",
    "we shall present some popular artificial benchmarks and show that partition similarity measures have to be handled with care .",
    "we will see under which conditions communities are detectable by methods , and expose the interplay between topological information and metadata .",
    "we will conclude by presenting some recent results on signatures of community structure extracted from real networks .",
    "the principle underneath stochastic block models ( section  [ sec - mv ] ) has inspired many popular benchmark graphs with group structure .",
    "community structure is recovered in the case in which the probability for two vertices to be joined is larger for vertices of the same group than for vertices of different groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stylized - hotdog ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that there are only two values of the edge probability , @xmath65 and @xmath100 , for edges within and between communities , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all communities have identical size @xmath101 , so @xmath102 , where @xmath75 is the number of communities . in this version ,",
    "the model coincides with the _ planted l - partition model _ , introduced in the context of graph partitioning ) ] . ]",
    "the expected internal and external degrees of a vertex are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , yielding an expected ( total ) vertex degree @xmath105 .",
    "girvan and newman  @xcite set @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( for a total number of vertices @xmath108 ) and fixed the average total degree @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that @xmath111 and @xmath65 and @xmath112 are not independent parameters .",
    "the benchmark by girvan and newman is still the most popular in the literature ( fig .",
    "[ figgn ] ) .",
    "performance plots of clustering algorithms typically have , on the horizontal axis , the expected external degree @xmath113",
    ". for low values of @xmath113 communities are well separated is higher , to keep the total degree constant . ] and most algorithms do a good job at detecting them . by increasing @xmath113 , the performance declines . still , one expects to do better than by assigning memberships to the vertices at random , as long as @xmath114 , which means for @xmath115 . in section  [ detectab ]",
    "we will see that the actual threshold is lower , due to random fluctuations .",
    "the benchmark by girvan and newman , however , is not a good proxy of real networks with community structure .",
    "for one thing , all vertices have equal degree , whereas the degree distribution of real networks is usually highly heterogeneous  @xcite . in addition , most clustering techniques find skewed distributions of community sizes  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , lancichinetti , fortunato and radicchi proposed the _ lfr benchmark _ , having power - law distributions of degree and community size  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ figlfr ] ) .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath116 of the vertices ( section  [ sec - var ] ) are set equal to a constant @xmath117 , which estimates the quality of the partition is actually only the average of the mixing parameter over all vertices .",
    "in fact , since degrees are integer , it is impossible to tune them such to have exactly the same value of @xmath117 for each vertex , and keep the constraint on the degree distribution at the same time . ] .",
    "lfr benchmark networks are built by joining stubs at random , once one has established which stubs are internal and which ones are external with respect to the community of the vertex attached to the stubs . in this respect",
    ", it is basically a configuration model  @xcite with built - in communities .",
    "clearly , when @xmath117 is low , clusters are better separated from each other , and easier to detect .",
    "when @xmath117 grows , performance starts to decline .",
    "but for which range of @xmath117 can we expect a performance better than random guessing ?",
    "let us suppose that the group structure is detectable for @xmath118 $ ] .",

    "_ cluster matching _ and _ information theory_.    pair counting means computing the number of pairs of vertices which are classified in the same ( different ) clusters in the two partitions .",
    "let @xmath154 indicate the number of pairs of vertices which are in the same community in both partitions , @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) the number of pairs of elements which are in the same community in @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) and in different communities in @xmath158 ( @xmath157 ) and @xmath159 the number of pairs of vertices that are in different communities in both partitions .",
    "several measures can be defined by combining the above numbers in various ways .",
    "a famous example is the _ rand index _",
    "@xcite @xmath160 which is the ratio of the number of vertex pairs correctly classified in both partitions ( i.  e. either in the same or in different clusters ) , by the total number of pairs .",
    "another notable option is the _ jaccard index _",
    "@xcite , @xmath161 which is the ratio of the number of vertex pairs classified in the same cluster in both partitions , by the number of vertex pairs classified in the same cluster in at least one partition .",
    "the jaccard index varies over a broader range than the rand index , due to the dominance of @xmath159 in @xmath162 , which typically confines the rand index to a small interval slightly below @xmath9 .",
    "both measures lie between @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
    "if we denote with @xmath163 and @xmath164 the sets of vertex pairs with are members of the same community in partitions @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively , the jaccard index is just the ratio between the intersection and the union of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "such concept can be used as well to determine the similarity between two clusters @xmath7 and @xmath62 @xmath165 the score @xmath166 is also called jaccard index and is the most general definition of the score , for any two sets @xmath7 and @xmath62  @xcite . measuring",
    "the similarity between communities is very important to determine , given different partitions , which cluster of a partition corresponds to which cluster(s ) of the other(s ) .",
    "for instance , the cluster @xmath149 of @xmath158 corresponding to cluster @xmath148 of @xmath158 is the one maximising the similarity between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , e. g. , @xmath167 .",
    "this strategy is also used to track down the evolution of communities in temporal networks  @xcite .",
    "the rand and the jaccard indices , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eqt04 ] ) and ( [ eqt20 ] ) , have the disturbing feature that they do not take values in the entire range @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "for this reason , adjusted versions of both indices exist , in that a baseline is introduced , yielding the expected values of the score for all pairs of partitions @xmath169 and @xmath170 obtained by randomly assigning vertices to clusters such that @xmath169 and @xmath170 have the same number of clusters and the same size for all clusters of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the baseline is subtracted from the unadjusted version , and the result is divided by the range of this difference , yielding @xmath9 for identical partitions and @xmath12 as expected value for independent partitions .",
    "but there are problems with these definitions as well . the null model used to compute the baseline relies on the assumption that the communities of the independent partitions have the same number of vertices as in the partitions whose similarity is to be compared .",
    "but such assumption usually does not hold , in practical instances , as algorithms sometimes need the number of communities as input , but they never impose any constraint on the cluster sizes . adjusted indices have also the disadvantage of nonlocality  @xcite : the similarity between partitions differing only in one region of the network depends on how the remainder of the network is subdivided",
    ". moreover , the adjusted scores can take negative values , when the unadjusted similarity lies below the baseline .",
    "a better option is to use _ standardised indices _",
    "@xcite : for a given score @xmath171 the value of the null model term @xmath116 is computed along with its standard deviation @xmath172 over many different randomisations of the partitions @xmath157 and @xmath158 . by computing the @xmath173-score @xmath174",
    "we can see how non - random the measured similarity score is , and assess its significance .",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath173-scores for the jaccard , rand and adjusted rand indices coincide  @xcite , so the measures are statistically equivalent .",
    "since the actual values @xmath171 of these indices differ for the same pair of partitions , in general , we conclude that the magnitudes of the scores may give a wrong perception about the effective similarity .    cluster matching aims at establishing a correspondence between pairs of clusters of different partitions based on the size of their overlap .",
    "a popular measure is the _ fraction of correctly detected vertices _ , introduced by girvan and newman  @xcite .",
    "a vertex is correctly classified if it is in the same cluster as at least half of the other vertices in its cluster in the planted partition .",
    "if the detected partition has clusters given by the merger of two or more groups of the planted partition , all vertices of those clusters are considered incorrectly classified . the number of correctly classified vertices is then divided by the number @xmath2 of vertices of the graph , yielding a number between @xmath12 and @xmath9 . the recipe to label vertices as correctly or incorrectly classified is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the fraction of correctly detected vertices is similar to @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the index of the best match @xmath177 of cluster @xmath178  @xcite .",
    "a common problem of this type of measures is that partitions whose clusters have the same overlap would have the same similarity , regardless of what happens to the parts of the communities which are unmatched .",
    "the situation is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ figsimclus ] . partitions @xmath179 and @xmath180",
    "are obtained from @xmath181 by reassigning the same fraction of their elements to the other clusters .",
    "their overlaps with @xmath181 are identical and so are the corresponding similarity scores . however , in partition @xmath180 the unmatched parts of the clusters are more scrambled than in @xmath179 , which should be reflected in a lower similarity score .",
    "similarity can be also estimated by computing , given a partition , the additional amount of information that one needs to have to infer the other partition .",
    "if partitions are similar , little information is needed to go from one to the other .",
    "such extra information can be used as a measure of dissimilarity . to evaluate the shannon information content  @xcite of a partition , we start from the community assignments @xmath182 and @xmath183 , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 indicate the cluster labels of vertex @xmath10 in partition @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",

    "the mutual information is not ideal as a similarity measure : for a given partition @xmath157 , all partitions derived from @xmath157 by splitting ( some of ) its clusters would all have the same mutual information with @xmath157 , even though they could be very different from each other . in this case",
    "the mutual information equals the entropy @xmath197 , because the conditional entropy is zero .",
    "it is then necessary to introduce an explicit dependence on the other partition , that persists even in those special cases .",
    "this has been achieved by introducing the _ normalized mutual information _ ( nmi ) , obtained by dividing the mutual information by the arithmetic average and @xmath198  @xcite .",

    "the nmi has been regularly used to compute the similarity of partitions in the literature .",
    "however , the measure is sensitive to the number of clusters @xmath200 of the detected partition , and may attain larger values the larger @xmath200 , even though more refined partitions are not necessarily closer to the planted one .",
    "this may give wrong perceptions about the relative performance of algorithms  @xcite .    a more promising measure , proposed by meil  @xcite is the _ variation of information _",
    "( vi ) @xmath201 the vi defines a metric in the space of partitions as it has the properties of distance ( non - negativity , symmetry and triangle inequality ) .",
    "it is a local measure : the vi of partitions differing only in a small portion of a graph depends on the differences of the clusters in that region , and not on how the rest of the graph is subdivided .",
    "the maximum value of the vi is @xmath202 , which implies that the scores of an algorithm on graphs of different sizes can not be compared with each other , in principle .",
    "one could divide @xmath203 by @xmath202  @xcite , to force the score to be in the range @xmath168 $ ] , but the actual span of values of the measure depends on the number of clusters of the partitions .",
    "in fact , if the maximum number of communities is @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , @xmath206 . consequently , in those cases where it is reasonable to set an upper bound on the number of clusters of the partitions , the similarities between planted and detected partitions on different graphs become comparable , and it is possible to assess both the performance of an algorithm and to compare algorithms across different benchmark graphs .",
    "we stress , however , that the measure may not be suitable when the partitions to be compared are very dissimilar from each other  @xcite and that it shows unintuitive behaviour in particular instances  @xcite .",
    "so far we discussed of comparing partitions .",
    "what about covers ?",
    "extensions of the measures we have presented to the case of overlapping communities are usually not straightforward .",

    "@xcite is an extension of the adjusted rand index  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath157 and @xmath158 be covers of the same graph to be compared .",
    "we denote with @xmath207 the number of pairs of vertices occurring together in exactly @xmath11 communities in both covers .",
    "it is a natural generalisation of the variables @xmath159 and @xmath154 we have seen above , where @xmath11 can also be larger than @xmath9 since a pair of vertices can now belong simultaneously to multiple communities .",
    "the variable @xmath208 is the fraction of pairs of vertices belonging to the same number of communities in both covers ( including the case @xmath209 , which refers to the pairs not being in any community together ) .",
    "the omega index is defined as @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the expected value of @xmath212 according to the null model discussed earlier , in which vertex labels are randomly reshuffled such to generate covers with the same number and size of the communities .",
    "the nmi has also been extended to covers by lancichinetti , fortunato and kertsz  @xcite .",
    "the definition is non - trivial : the community assignments of a cover are expressed by a vectorial random variable , as each vertex may belong to multiple clusters at the same time .",
    "the measure overestimates the similarity of two covers , in special situations , where intuition suggests much lower values .",
    "the problem can be solved by using an alternative normalisation , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately neither the definition by lancichinetti , fortunato and kertsz nor the one by mcdaid , greene and hurley are proper extensions of the nmi , as they do not coincide with the classic definition of eq .",

    "a suitable option is the _ fuzzy rand index _",

    ", a nave approach would be comparing partitions ( or covers ) corresponding to configurations of the system in the same time window , and to see how this score varies across different time windows .",
    "however , this does not tell if the clusters are evolving in the same way , as there would be no connection between clusterings at different times .",
    "a sensible approach is comparing sequences of clusterings , by building a confusion matrix that takes into account multiple snapshots .",
    "this strategy allows one to define dynamic versions of various indices , like the nmi and the vi  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",

    "indeed , the groups make sense topologically : vertices @xmath9 and @xmath242 are hubs , and most members are directly connected to either of them .",
    "most algorithms of community detection have been tested on this network , as well as others , e. g. , the american college football network  @xcite or lusseau s network of bottlenose dolphins  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the method doing the best job at recovering groups with identical annotations would also be the most reliable in applications .    such idea , however , is based on a questionable principle , i. e. , that the groups corresponding to the metadata are also communities in the topological sense we have discussed in section  [ sec - comm ] .",
    "communities exist because their vertices are supposed to be similar to each other , in some way .",
    "the similarity among the vertices is then revealed topologically through the higher edge probability among pairs of members of the same group than between pairs of members of different groups , whose similarity is lower .",
    "hence , when one is provided with annotations or other sources of information that allows to classify vertices based on their similarity , one expects that such similarity - based classes are also the best communities that structure - based algorithms may detect .",
    "indeed , for some small networks like zachary s karate club this seems to be the case .",
    "but for quite some time scholars could not test this hypothesis , due to the limited number of suitable data sets . over the past few years",
    "this has finally become possible , due to the availability of several large network data sets with annotated vertices  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the alignment between the communities found by standard clustering algorithms and the annotated groups is not good , in general . in fig .",
    "[ tmhric ] we show the similarity between the topological partitions found by different methods and the annotated partitions , for several social , information and technological networks  @xcite .",
    "the heights of the vertical bars are the values of the normalised mutual information ( nmi )  @xcite .",
    "groups of contiguous bars represent the scores for a given data set . to the left of the vertical dashed line",
    "we see the results for classic benchmarks , like lfr graphs ( section  [ art - bench ] )  @xcite , zachary karate club , etc . , and the scores are generally good . but for the large data sets to the right of the line the scores are rather low , signalling a significant mismatch between topological and annotated communities . for amazon",
    "co - purchasing network  @xcite , in which vertices are products and edges are set between products often purchased by the same customer(s ) , the similarity is quite a bit higher than for the other networks .",
    "this is because the classification of amazon products is hierarchical ( e. g. , ` books / fiction / fantasy ` ) , so there are different levels of annotated communities , and the reported scores refer to the one which is most similar to the structural ones detected by the algorithms , while the other levels would give lower similarity scores .",
    "low similarity at the partition level does not rule out that some communities of the structural partition significantly overlap with their annotated counterparts , but precision and recall scores show that this is not the case .",
    "results depend more on the network than on the specific method adopted , none of which appears to be particularly good on any ( large ) data set .",
    "so the hypothesis that structural and annotated clusters are aligned is not warranted , in general .",
    "there can be multiple reasons for that .",
    "the attributes could be too general or too specific , yielding communities which are too large or too small to be interesting .",
    "moreover , while the best partition of the network delivered by an algorithm can be poorly correlated with the metadata , there may be alternative topological divisions that also belong to a set of valid solutions , according to the algorithm , but happen to be better correlated with the annotations  @xcite .",
    "the fact that structural and annotated communities may not be strongly correlated has important consequences .",
    "scholars have been regularly testing their algorithms on small annotated graphs , like zachary s karate club , by tuning parameters such to obtain the best possible performance on them .",
    "this is not justified , in general , as it makes sense only when there is a strong correspondence , which is a priori unknown .",
    "also , forcing an alignment with annotations on one data set does not guarantee that there is going to be a good alignment with the annotations of a different network .",
    "besides , one of the reasons why people use clustering algorithms is to provide an improved classification of the vertices , by using structure .",
    "if one obtained the same thing , why bother ?",
    "the right thing to do is using structure _ along with _ the annotations , instead of insisting on matching them . this way the information coming from structure and metadata can be combined and we can obtain more accurate partitions , if there is any correspondence between them .",
    "recent approaches explicitly assume that the metadata ( or a portion thereof ) are either exactly or approximately correlated with the best topological partition  @xcite .",
    "a better approach is not assuming a priori that the metadata correlate with the structural communities .",
    "the goal is quantifying the relationship between metadata and community and use it to improve the results .",
    "if there is no correlation , the metadata would be ignored , leaving us with the partition derived from structure alone .",
    "methods along these lines have been developed , using stochastic block models .",
    "newman and clauset  @xcite have proposed a model in which vertices are initially assigned to clusters based on metadata , and then edges are placed between vertices according to the degree - corrected stochastic block model  @xcite .",
    "hric et al . have designed a similar model  @xcite , in which the interplay between structure and metadata is represented by a multilayer network ( fig .",
    "[ dameta ] ) .",
    "the generative model is an extension of the hierarchical stochastic block model ( sbm )  @xcite with degree - correction for the case with edge layers  @xcite .    at ( 0,0 ) ;    at ( 0,0 ) ;    here the metadata is not supposed to correspond simply to a partition of the vertices .",
    "the majority of data sets contain rich metadata , with vertices being annotated multiple times , and often few vertices possess the exact same annotations and can be thus associated to the same group .",
    "in addition , while the number of communities is required as input by the method of newman and clauset , here it is inferred from the data .",
    "finally , it is also possible to assess the metadata in its power to predict the network structure , not only their correlation with latent partitions . this way it is possible to predict _ missing vertices _ of the network , i. e. , to infer the connections of a vertex from its annotations only .",
    "we stress that neither method requires that all vertices are annotated .",
    "applications of the method by hric et al .",
    "@xcite reveal that in many data sets there are statistically significant correlations between the annotations and the network structure , while in some cases the metadata seems to be largely uncorrelated with structural clusters .",
    "we conclude that network metadata should not be used indiscriminately as ground truth for community detection methods .",
    "even when the metadata is strongly predictive of the network structure , the agreement between the annotations and the network division tends to be complex , and very different from the one - to - one mapping that is more commonly assumed .",
    "moreover , data sets usually contain considerable noise in their annotations , and some metadata tags are essentially random , with no relationship to structure .",
    "artificial benchmark graphs are certainly very useful to assess the performance of clustering algorithms .",
    "however , one could always question whether the model of community structure they propose is reliable .",
    "how can we assess this ? in order to characterise  real \" communities we have to find them first .",
    "but that can only be done via some algorithm , and different algorithms search for different types of objects , in general .",
    "still , one may hope that general properties of communities can be consistently uncovered across different methods and data sets , while other features are more closely tied to the specific method(s ) used to detect the clusters and ( or ) the specific data set at study ( or classes thereof ) .",
    "a seemingly robust feature of communities in real networks is the heterogeneity of their size distribution .",
    "most clustering techniques find skewed distributions of cluster sizes in many networks .",
    "so , there appears to be no characteristic size for a community : small communities usually coexist with large ones .",
    "this feature is rather independent of the type of network ( fig .",
    "[ figcomsize ] ) .",
    "it may signal a hierarchy among communities , with small clusters included in large ones .",
    "methods unable to distinguish between hierarchical levels might find  blended \" partitions , consisting of communities of different levels and hence of very different sizes .",
    "the lfr benchmark was the first graph model to take explicitly into account the heterogeneity of community sizes ( section  [ art - bench ] ) .",
    "another interesting question is how the quality of communities depends on their size .",
    "leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite carried out a systematic analysis of clusters in many large networks , including traditional and on - line social networks , technological , information networks and web graphs . instead of considering partitions , they focused on individual communities , which are derived by optimising conductance ( section  [ sec - var ] ) around seed vertices .",
    "we remind that the conductance of a cluster is the ratio between the number of external edges and the total degree of the cluster .",
    "minimising conductance effectively combines the two main community demands , i. e. , good separation from the rest of the graph ( low numerator ) and large number of internal edges ( high denominator ) .",
    "the measure is also relatively insensitive to the size of the clusters , as both the numerator and the denominator are typically proportional to the number of vertices of the community",
    ". therefore one could use it to compare the quality of clusters of different sizes . for any given size @xmath56 leskovec et al . identified the subgraph with @xmath56 vertices with the lowest conductance .",
    "this way , for each network one can draw the _ network community profile _ ( ncp ) , showing the minimum conductance as a function of community size .",
    "the ncps of all networks studied by leskovec et al .",
    "have a characteristic shape : they go downwards till @xmath243 vertices , and then they rise monotonically for larger subgraphs [ fig .",
    "[ figlesk ] ( left ) ] .",
    "alternative shapes have been recently found for other data sets  @xcite .    for networks characterised by ncps like the one in fig .",
    "[ figlesk ] ( left ) the most pronounced communities are fairly small in size .",
    "such small clusters are weakly connected to the rest of the network , often by a single edge ( in this case they are called _ whiskers _ ) , and form the _ periphery _ of the graph .",
    "large clusters have comparatively lower quality and melt into a big _ core_. large communities can often be split in parts with lower conductance , so they can be considered conglomerates of smaller communities . a schematic picture of the resulting network structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlesk ] ( right ) .",
    "the shape of the ncp is fairly independent of the specific technique adopted to identify the subgraphs with minimum conductance .",
    "the different shapes of the ncps encountered in data suggest that core - periphery is not the only model of group structure of real networks  @xcite .",
    "the ncp is a signature that can be used to select generative mechanisms of community structure . indeed",
    ", many standard models typically yield ncp sloping steadily downwards , at odds with the ones encountered in many social and information networks .",
    "stochastic block models ( section  [ sec - mv ] ) are sufficiently versatile that they can reproduce the ncp shape of fig .",
    "[ figlesk ] ( left ) , by suitably tuning the parameters . in the standard lfr benchmark ( section  [ art - bench ] ) the mixing parameters are tightly concentrated about a value @xmath117 by construction ,",
    "hence all clusters have approximately conductance @xmath117 , yielding a roughly flat ncp , it can be easily shown that the conductance of the subgraph is exactly equal to @xmath117 . ]",
    "however , the model can be easily modified by making @xmath117 community - dependent and a large variety of ncps are attainable , including the one of fig .",
    "[ figlesk ] ( left ) .",
    "the main problem of working with ncps is that they are based on extreme statistics , as one systematically reports the minimum conductance for a given cluster size . how representative is this extremal subgraph of the population of subgraphs with the same size",
    "? there may be just a few clusters of a given size with low conductance .",
    "it may happen that many subgraphs have conductance near the minimum corresponding to their size(s ) , which would then be representative .",
    "alternatively most subgraphs might have much larger conductance than the minimum but low enough that they can be still considered communities . in this case",
    "one should conclude that communities of that size are not of very high quality , on average .",
    "the above scenarios might lead to different conclusions about the actual community structure of the system .",
    "in general , even if one could produce a version of the ncp where the trend refers to representative samples of communities of equal size ( whatever that means ) , the actual values of the conductance are as important as the shape of the curve .",
    "if conductance is sufficiently low for all cluster sizes , it means that there are good communities of any size .",
    "the fact that small clusters could be of higher quality does not undermine the role of large clusters .",
    "the observation that large clusters consist of smaller clusters of higher quality may just be evidence of hierarchical structure in the network , which is a trademark of many complex systems  @xcite . in that case",
    "high levels of the hierarchy are not less important than low ones , a priori .",
    "in fact , the actual relative importance of communities should not only come from the sheer value of specific metrics , like conductance , but also from their statistical significance ( section  [ sec - sign ] ) .    that notwithstanding , we strongly encourage analyses like the one by leskovec et al . , as they provide a statistical characterisation of community structure , in a way that is only weakly algorithm - dependent .",
    "one has to define operationally what a cluster is , but in a simple intuitive way that allows us to draw conclusions about the structure of the graph . in principle",
    "one could do the same by analysing the clusters delivered by any algorithm , but there would be two important drawbacks .",
    "first , the clusters may not be easy to interpret , as most clustering algorithms usually do not require a clear - cut definition of community .",
    "second , one would have to handle a partition of the network in communities , instead of probing locally the group structure of the network .",
    "therefore , for a given vertex one would have only one cluster ( or a handful , if communities overlap ) , while a local exploration allows to analyse a whole population of candidate subgraphs , which gives more information .",
    "the local subgraphs recovered this way do not need to be strongly matching the clusters delivered by any algorithm , but they provide useful signatures that allow to restrict the set of possible model explanations for the network s group structure .",
    "such investigation can be replicated on any model graph to check whether the results match ( e. g. , whether the ncps coincide ) .",
    "[ fig : noover ]    +   +    another approach to infer properties of clusters of real networks is using annotations . while we have shown",
    "that annotated clusters do not necessarily coincide with structural ones ( section  [ topmet ] ) , general features can be still derived , provided they are consistently found across different data sets and annotations .",
    "a recent analysis by yang and leskovec has questioned the common picture of networks with overlapping communities  @xcite .",
    "scholars usually assume that clusters overlap at their boundaries , hence edge density should be larger in the non - overlapping parts ( fig .",
    "[ figoverl ] ) . instead , by analysing the overlaps of annotated clusters in large social and information networks , yang and leskovec found that the probability that two vertices are connected is larger in the overlaps , and grows with the number of communities sharing that pair of vertices .",
    "in addition , _ connector vertices _ , i. e. , vertices with the largest number of neighbours within a community , are more likely to be found in the overlaps .",
    "these findings suggest that the overlaps may play an important role in the community structure of networks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : agm ] we compare the conventional view with the one resulting from the analysis . the _ community - affiliation graph model _ ( agm )  @xcite and the _ cluster affiliation model for big networks _ ( bigclam )  @xcite are clustering techniques based on generative models of networks featuring communities with dense overlaps .",
    "the models are based on the principle that vertices are more likely to be neighbours the more the communities sharing them , in line with the empirical finding of  @xcite .",
    "actual overlapping communities exist in many contexts .",
    "however , it is unclear whether soft clustering is statistically founded . a recent analysis aiming at identifying suitable stochastic block models to describe real network data indicate that in many cases hard partitions ought to be preferred , as they give simpler descriptions of the group structure of the data than soft partitions  @xcite .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the underlying models are based on placing edges independently of each other , neglecting higher order structures between vertices , like motifs . by adopting approaches that take into account higher - order structures things may change and community overlaps might become a statistically robust feature .",
    "the pervasive overlaps found by yang and leskovec in annotated data can be found if higher order effects are considered  @xcite , without ad hoc hypotheses .",
    "there are many algorithms to detect communities in graphs",
    ". they can be grouped in categories , based on different criteria , like the actual operational method  @xcite , or the underlying concept of community  @xcite . in most applications , however , just a few popular algorithms are employed . in this section",
    "we present a critical analysis of these methods .",
    "we show the advantages of knowing the number of clusters before - hand and how it is possible to derive robust solutions from partitions delivered by stochastic clustering techniques .",
    "we discuss approaches to the problem of detecting communities in evolving networks and how to assess the significance of the detected clustering .",
    "we conclude by suggesting the methods that currently appear to be most promising .      in general , the only preliminary information available to any algorithm",
    "is the structure of the network , i. e. , which pairs of vertices are connected to each other and which are not ( possibly including weights ) .",
    "any insight about community structure is supposed to be given as output of the procedure .",
    "naturally , it would be valuable to have some information on the unknown division of the network beforehand , as one could reduce considerably the huge space of possible solutions , and increase the chance of successfully identifying the communities .    among all the possible pre - detection inputs ,",
    "the number @xmath75 of clusters plays a prominent role .",
    "many popular classes of algorithms require the specification of @xmath75 before they run , like methods imported from data clustering or parametric statistical inference approaches ( section  [ sec - inference ] ) .",
    "other methods are capable to infer @xmath75 as they can choose among partitions into different numbers of communities .",

    "we see that the accuracy improves considerably when @xmath75 is known .",
    "this is particularly striking in the case of modularity optimisation , which is known to have a limited resolution , preventing the method from identifying the correct scale of the communities , even when the latter are very pronounced  @xcite ( section  [ sec - modopt ] ) .",
    "knowing @xmath75 and constraining the optimisation of the measure to partitions with fixed @xmath75 , the problem can be alleviated  @xcite .",
    "but how do we know how many clusters there are ? here",
    "we briefly discuss some heuristic techniques , for statistically principled methods we defer the reader to section  [ sec - inference ] .",
    "it has been recently shown that in the planted partition model @xmath75 can be correctly inferred all the way up to the detectability limit from the spectra of two matrices : the _ non - backtracking matrix _ @xmath244  @xcite and the _ flow matrix _ @xmath245  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath246 matrices , where @xmath3 is the number of edges of the graph .",

    "their elements read @xmath249 and @xmath250 in eq .",
    "( [ eqfm ] ) @xmath18 is the degree of vertex @xmath10 .",
    "so the elements of @xmath245 are basically the elements of @xmath244 , normalised by vertex degrees .",
    "this is done to account for the heterogeneous degree distributions observed in most real networks .",
    "both matrices have non - zero elements only for each pair of edges forming a directed path from the first vertex of one edge to the second of the other edge .",
    "to do that , edges have to be incident at one vertex . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the non - backtracking matrix @xmath244 is just the adjacency matrix of the ( directed ) edges of the graph .",
    "the name of the matrix @xmath251 is due to a connection with the properties of non - backtracking walks .",
    "non - backtracking walk _",
    "@xcite is a path across the edges of a graph that is allowed to return to a vertex visited previously only after at least two other vertices have been visited ; immediate returns like @xmath252 are forbidden .",
    "the elements of the @xmath56-th power of @xmath251 yield the number of non - backtracking walks of length @xmath56 from a ( directed ) edge of the graph to another and the trace of the power matrix the number of closed non - backtracking walks of length @xmath56 starting from any given ( directed ) edge .",
    "a remarkable property of both matrices is that on networks with homogeneous groups ( i. e. , of similar size and internal edge density ) most eigenvalues , which are generally complex , are enclosed by a circle centred at the origin , and that the number of eigenvalues lying outside of the circle is a good proxy of the number of communities of the network  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath244 the circle s radius is given by the square root @xmath253 of the leading eigenvalue @xmath137 , which may diverge for networks with heterogeneous degree distributions ( e. g. , power laws ) ; for @xmath245 it equals @xmath254 , which is never greater than @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , computing the eigenvalues of the non - backtracking or the flow matrix is lengthy .",
    "both are @xmath246 matrices .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath255 has @xmath256 elements , so @xmath244 and @xmath245 are larger by a factor of @xmath257 , where @xmath109 is the average degree of the network",
    ". an approximate but reliable computation of the spectra requires a time which scales superlinearly ( approximately quadratic ) with the network size @xmath2 .",
    "so the problem is intractable for graphs with number of edges of the order of millions or higher .",
    "also , if communities have diverse sizes and edge densities , as it happens in most networks encountered in applications , the bulk of eigenvalues may not have a circular shape , and it may become problematic to identify eigenvalues falling outside of the bulk .",
    "besides , non - backtracking walks must contain cycles , hence trees dangling off the graph do not affect the spectrum of @xmath251 , which remains unchanged if all dangling trees are removed .",
    "this is a disturbing feature , as tree - like regions of the graph may play a role in the network s community structure , and most methods would find different partitions if trees are kept or removed .",
    "the spectrum of the flow matrix , instead , changes when dangling trees are kept or removed  @xcite . in the limiting case in which the network itself is a tree , all eigenvalues of @xmath251 and @xmath258 are zero and even if there were a community structure one gets no relevant information .",
    "the number of clusters can also be deduced by studying how the eigenvectors of graph matrices rotate when the adjacency matrix of the graph is subjected to random perturbations  @xcite .",
    "on stochastic block models this approach infers the correct value of @xmath75 up to a threshold preceding the detectability limit .",
    "the method is also computationally expensive .    in general ,",
    "if one can identify a set ( range ) of promising @xmath75-values , from preliminary information or via calculations like the ones described above or in section  [ sec - inference ] , it is better to run constrained versions of clustering methods , searching for solutions only among partitions with those numbers of communities , than letting the methods discover @xmath75 by themselves , which may lead to solutions of lower quality .",
    "many clustering techniques are stochastic in character and do not deliver a unique answer .",
    "a common scenario is when the desired solution corresponds to extrema of a cost function , that can only be found via approximation techniques , with results depending on random seeds and on the choice of initial conditions .",
    "techniques not based on optimisation sometimes have the same feature , when tie - break rules are adopted in order to choose among multiple equivalent options encountered along the calculation .",

    "unfortunately , many of the networks encountered in practical studies are very sparse and can lead to this type of problems .    indeed on sparse networks constructed with the planted partition model spectral methods relying on standard matrices [ adjacency matrix , laplacian , modularity matrix  @xcite , etc . ]",
    "fail before the theoretical detectability limit ( section  [ detectab ] )  @xcite . the non - backtracking matrix @xmath251 of eq .  ( [ eqnbtm ] ) was introduced to address this problem  @xcite . on the planted partition model",
    "the associated eigenvalues of the community - related eigenvectors of @xmath251 are separated from the bulk until the theoretical detectability limit , so spectral methods using the top eigenvectors of @xmath251 are capable to find communities as long as they are detectable , modulo the caveats we expressed in section  [ sec - tools ] .",
    "soft clustering , where communities may overlap , is an even harder problem than hard clustering , where there is no community overlap .",
    "the possibility of having multiple memberships for the vertices introduces additional degrees of freedom in the problem , causing a huge expansion of the space of possible solutions .",
    "it has been pointed out that overlapping communities , especially in social networks , reflect different types of associations between people  @xcite .",
    "two actors could be co - workers , friends , relatives , sport mates , etc .. actor @xmath7 could be a work colleague of @xmath62 and a friend of @xmath17 , so she would sit in the overlap between the community of colleagues of @xmath62 and the community of friends of @xmath17 .",
    "for this reason , it has been suggested that an effective way to recover overlapping clusters is to group edges , rather than vertices . in the example above , the edges connecting @xmath7 with @xmath62 and @xmath7 with @xmath17 would be placed in different groups , and since they both have @xmath7 as endpoint , the latter turns out to be an overlapping vertex .",
    "moreover , edge clustering is claimed to have the additional advantage of reconciling soft clustering with hierarchical community structure  @xcite .",
    "if there is hierarchy , communities are nested within each other as many times as there are hierarchical levels .",
    "hierarchical structure is often represented via _",
    "dendrograms _ , with the network being divided in clusters , which are in turn divided in clusters , and so on until one ends up with singleton clusters , consisting of one vertex each .",
    "but this can be done only if communities do not share vertices .",
    "overlapping vertices should be assigned to multiple clusters of lower hierarchical levels , yielding multiple copies of them in the dendrogram .",
    "instead , one could build a dendrogram displaying edge communities , where each edge is assigned to a single cluster , but clusters can still overlap because edges in different clusters may share one endpoint  @xcite .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "first , there may still be overlapping communities even if there were a single type of association between the vertices . for instance , if we keep only the friendship relationships within a given population of actors , there are many social circles and there could be active actors with multiple ties within two circles , or more .",
    "second , in the traditional picture of networks with community structure ( fig .",
    "[ figcom ] ) , the edges connecting two different groups may be assigned to one of the communities they join or they could be put together in a separate group . either way , they would signal an overlap between the communities , which is artificial .",
    "this happens even in the extreme case of a single edge connecting vertices @xmath7 and @xmath62 of two groups , as that edge will have to be assigned to a group , which inevitably forces @xmath7 and @xmath62 into a common cluster .",
    "third , if we rely on the picture emerging from the analysis by yang and leskovec  @xcite ( section  [ ncp ] ) overlaps between clusters could be much denser than we expect , hence not only vertices but also edges may be shared among different groups , and edge dendrograms would have the same problem as classic vertex dendrograms .",
    "fourth , the computational complexity of the calculation can rise substantially , as in networks of interest there are typically many more edges than vertices . finally , there is nothing revealing that there is a conceptual or algorithmic advantage in grouping edges versus vertices , other than works showing that a specific edge clustering technique outperforms some vertex clustering techniques on a specific set of networks",
    ".    to shed some light on the situation , we performed the following test .",
    "we took some network data sets with annotated vertices , giving an indication about what the communities of those networks could be that metadata are not necessarily correlated with topological clusters .",
    "we used data sets for which there is some correlation . ] . for each network",
    "@xmath6 we derived the corresponding _ line graph _ @xmath264 , which is the graph whose vertices are the edges of @xmath6 , while edges are set between pairs of vertices of @xmath264 whose corresponding edges in @xmath6 are adjacent at one of their endpoints .",
    "vertex communities of @xmath264 are then edge communities of the original network @xmath6 .",
    "the question is whether by working on @xmath264 the detection improves or not .",
    "we searched for overlapping communities with oslom  @xcite .",
    "we applied oslom on the original graphs and on their line graphs .",
    "the covers found on the line graphs were turned into covers of the vertices of @xmath6 , by replacing each vertex of @xmath264 with the pair of vertices of the corresponding edge of @xmath6 .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figlg ] , showing how similar the covers found on the original networks and on the line graphs are with respect to the covers of annotated vertices .",
    "neither approach is very accurate , as expected ( see section  [ topmet ] and fig .",
    "[ tmhric ] ) , but vertex communities show a greater association to the annotated clusters than edge communities , except in a few instances where the similarity is very low .",
    "analyses carried out on lfr benchmark graphs ( not shown ) lead to the same conclusion .",
    "we stress that traditional line graphs have the problem that edges adjacent to a hub vertex in the original graph turn into vertices who are all connected to each other , forming giant cliques , which might dominate the structure of the line graph , misleading clustering techniques .",
    "the procedure can be refined by introducing weights for the edges of the line graphs , that can be computed in various ways , e. g. , based on the similarity of the neighbourhoods of adjacent edges in the original network  @xcite .",
    "still we believe that our tests provide some evidence that edge clustering is no better than vertex clustering , in general .",
    "the superiority of algorithms based on either approach should be assessed a posteriori , case by case , and the answer may depend on the specific data sets under investigation .",
    "statistical inference provides a powerful set of tools to tackle the problem of community detection .",
    "the standard approach is to fit a generative network model on the data  @xcite .",
    "the stochastic block model ( sbm ) is by far the most used generative model of graphs with communities ( see section  [ sec - mv ] and references therein ) .",
    "we have seen that it can describe other types of group structure , like disassortative and core - periphery structure ( fig .",
    "[ figsbm ] ) .",
    "the unnormalised maximum log - likelihood that a given partition @xmath265 in @xmath75 groups of the network @xmath6 is reproduced by the standard sbm reads  @xcite @xmath266 where @xmath88 is the number of edges running from group @xmath83 to group @xmath84 , @xmath267 ( @xmath268 ) the number of vertices in @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and the sum runs over all pairs of groups ( including when @xmath269 ) .",
    "this version of the model , however , does not account for the degree heterogeneity of most real networks , so it does a poor job at describing the group structure of many of them .",
    "therefore , karrer and newman proposed the _ degree - corrected stochastic block model _ ( dcsbm )  @xcite , in which the degrees of the vertices are kept constant , on average , via the introduction of additional suitable parameters .",
    "the unnormalised maximum log - likelihood for the dcsbm is @xmath270 where @xmath271 ( @xmath272 ) is the sum of the degrees of the vertices in @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the most important drawback of this type of approach is the need to specify the number @xmath75 of groups beforehand , which is usually unknown for real networks .",
    "this is because a straight maximisation of the likelihoods of eqs .",
    "( [ eqllsbm ] ) and ( [ eqlldc ] ) over the whole set of possible solutions yields the trivial partition in which each vertex is a cluster ( _ overfitting _ ) . in section  [ sec - tools ]",
    "we have seen ways to extract @xmath75 from spectral properties of the graph .",
    "but it would be better to have statistically principled methods , to be consistent with the approach used to perform the inference .",
    "a possibility is _ model selection _ , for instance by choosing the model that best compresses the data  @xcite .",
    "the extent of the compression can be estimated via the total amount of information necessary to describe the data , which includes not only the fitted model , but also the information necessary to describe the model itself , which is a growing function of the number of blocks @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "this quantity , that we indicate with @xmath273 , is called the _",
    "description length_. minimising the description length naturally avoids overfitting . partitions with large @xmath75 are associated to  heavy \" models in terms of their information content , and do not represent the best compression . on the other hand , partitions with low @xmath75 have high information content , even if the model itself is not loaded with parameters .",
    "hence the minimum description length corresponds to a non - trivial number of groups and it makes sense to minimise @xmath273 to infer the block structure of the graph .",
    "it turns out that this approach has a limited resolution on the standard sbm : the maximum number of blocks that can be resolved scales as @xmath274 for a fixed average degree @xmath109 , where @xmath2 is the number of vertices of the network .",
    "this means that the minimum size of detectable blocks scales as @xmath274 , just as it happens for modularity maximisation ( section  [ sec - modopt ] ) . a more refined method of model selection , consisting in a nested hierarchy of stochastic block models , where an upper level of the hierarchy serves as prior information to a lower level , brings the resolution limit down to @xmath202 , enabling the detection of much smaller blocks  @xcite .",
    "other techniques to extract the number of groups have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "optimisation techniques have received the greatest attention in the literature .",
    "the goal is finding an extremum , usually the maximum , of a function indicating the quality of a clustering , over the space of all possible clusterings .",
    "quality functions can express the goodness of a partition or of single clusters .",
    "the most popular quality function is the _ modularity _ by newman and girvan  @xcite .",
    "it estimates the quality of a partition of the network in communities .",
    "the general expression of modularity is @xmath275 where @xmath3 is the number of edges of the network , the sum runs over all pairs of vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath8 is the element of the adjacency matrix , @xmath276 is the _",
    "null model term _ and in the kronecker delta at the end @xmath277 and @xmath278 indicate the communities of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the term @xmath276 indicates the average adjacency matrix of an ensemble of networks , derived by randomising the original graph , such to preserve some of its features .",
    "therefore , modularity measures how different the original graph is from such randomisations .",
    "the concept was inspired by the idea that by randomising the network structure communities are destroyed , so the comparison between the actual structure and its randomisation reveals how non - random the group structure is .",
    "a standard choice is @xmath279 , @xmath18 and @xmath121 being the degrees of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and corresponds to the expected number of edges joining vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 if the edges of the network were rewired such to preserve the degree of all vertices , on average .",
    "this yields the classic form of modularity @xmath280 other choices of the null model term allow us to incorporate specific features of network structure , like bipartiteness  @xcite , correlations  @xcite , signed edges  @xcite , space embeddedness  @xcite , etc .. the extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod ] ) and of its variants to the case of weighted networks is straightforward  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we focus on unweighted graphs here , but the issues we discuss are general .    because of the delta ,",
    "the only contributions to the sum come from vertex pairs belonging to the same cluster , so we can group these contributions together and rewrite the sum over the vertex pairs as a sum over the clusters @xmath281 .",
    "\\label{eq : mod1}\\ ] ] here @xmath282 the total number of edges joining vertices of community @xmath17 and @xmath283 the sum of the degrees of the vertices of @xmath17 ( section  [ sec - var ] ) . the first term of each summand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod1 ] ) is the fraction of edges of the graph falling within community @xmath17 , whereas the second term is the expected fraction of edges that would fall inside @xmath17 if the graph were taken from the ensemble of random graphs preserving the degree of each vertex of the original network , on average .",
    "the difference in the summand would then indicate how  non - random \" subgraph @xmath17 is .",
    "the larger the difference the more confident we can be that the placement of edges within @xmath17 is not random ( fig .",
    "[ mod - ill ] ) .",
    "large values of @xmath284 are then supposed to indicate partitions with high quality .",
    "modularity maximisation is np - hard  @xcite .",
    "therefore one can realistically hope to find only decent approximations of the modularity maximum and a wide variety of approaches has been proposed .",
    "due to its simplicity , the prestige of its inventors and early results on the benchmark of girvan and newman ( section  [ art - bench ] ) and on small real benchmark networks , like zachary karate club network ( fig .",
    "[ zach ] ) , modularity has become the best known and most studied object in network clustering .",
    "in fact , soon after its introduction , it seemed to represent the essence of the problem , and the key to its solution .",
    "however , it became quickly clear that the measure is not as good as it looks .",
    "for one thing , there are high - modularity partitions even in random graphs without groups  @xcite .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , given that modularity has been designed to capture the difference between random and non - random structure .",
    "modularity is a sort of distance between the actual network and _ an average _ over random networks , ignoring altogether the distribution of the relevant community variables , like the fractions of edges within the clusters , over all realisations generated by the configuration model .",
    "if the distribution is not strongly peaked , the values of the community variables measured on the original graph may be found in a large number of randomised networks , even though the averages look far away from them . in other words",
    ", we should pay more attention to the _ significance _ of the maximum modularity value @xmath285 , than to the value itself .",
    "how can we estimate the significance of @xmath285 ?",
    "a natural way is maximising @xmath284 over all partitions of every randomised graph .",
    "one then computes the average @xmath286 and the standard deviation @xmath287 of the resulting values .",
    "the statistical significance of @xmath285 is indicated by the distance of @xmath285 from the null model average @xmath286 in units of the standard deviation @xmath287 , i. e. , by the @xmath173-score @xmath288 if @xmath289 , @xmath285 indicates strong community structure .",
    "this approach has problems , though .",
    "the main drawback is that the distribution of @xmath290 over the ensemble of null model random graphs , though peaked , is not gaussian .",
    "therefore , one can not attribute to the values of the @xmath173-score the significance corresponding to a gaussian distribution , and one ought to compute the statistical significance for the correct distribution . also , the @xmath173-score depends on the network size , so the same values may indicate different levels of significance for networks differing considerably in size .",
    "next , it is not true that the modularity maximum always corresponds to the most pronounced community structure of a network . in fig .",
    "[ reslim ] we show the well - known example of the ring of cliques  @xcite .",
    "the network consists of @xmath110 cliques with four vertices each .",
    "every clique has two neighbouring cliques , connected to it via a single edge .",
    "intuition suggests that the graph has a natural community structure , with @xmath110 communities , each corresponding to one clique .",
    "indeed , the @xmath284-value of this partition is @xmath291 , pretty close to @xmath9 , which is the upper bound of modularity .",
    "however , there are partitions with larger values , like the partition in @xmath292 clusters indicated by the dashed contours , whose modularity is @xmath293 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath284 has a preferential scale for the communities , deriving from the underlying null model and revealed by its explicit dependence on the number of edges @xmath3 of the network [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod1 ] ) ] . according to the configuration model ,",
    "the expected number @xmath294 of edges running between two subgraphs @xmath7 and @xmath62 with total degree @xmath295 and @xmath296 , respectively , is approximately @xmath297 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath295 and @xmath296 are of the order of @xmath298 or smaller , @xmath294 could become smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "this means that in many randomisations of the original graph @xmath6 , subgraphs @xmath7 and @xmath62 are disconnected and even a single edge joining them in @xmath6 signals a non - random association . in these cases , modularity is larger when @xmath7 and @xmath62 are put together than when they are treated as distinct communities , as in the example of fig .",
    "[ reslim ] .",
    "the modularity scale depends only on the number of edges @xmath3 , and it may have nothing to do with the size of the actual communities of the network .",
    "the resolution limit questions the usefulness of modularity in practical applications  @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to mitigate the consequences of this disturbing feature .",
    "one approach consists in introducing a resolution parameter @xmath299 into modularity s formula  @xcite . by tuning @xmath299",
    "it is possible to arbitrarily vary the resolution scale of the method , going from very large to very small communities",
    ". we shall discuss such multi - resolution approaches in section  [ sec - dynmet ] .",
    "here we emphasize that multi - resolution versions of modularity do not provide a reliable solution to the problem .",
    "this is because modularity maximisation has an additional bias : large subgraphs are usually split in smaller pieces  @xcite .",
    "this problem has the same source as the resolution limit , namely the choice of the null model . since modularity has a preferential scale for the communities , when a subgraph is too large it is convenient to break it down , to increase the modularity of the partition .",
    "so , when there is no characteristic scale for the communities , like when there is a broad cluster size distribution , large communities are likely to be broken , and small communities are likely to be merged .",
    "since multi - resolution versions of modularity can only shift the resolution scale of the measure back and forth , they are unable to correct both effects at the same time  @xcite . in addition",
    ", tuning the resolution parameter in the search for good partitions is usually computationally very demanding , as in many cases the optimisation procedure has to be repeated over and over for all @xmath299-values one desires to investigate .",
    "we stress that the resolution limit is a feature of modularity itself , not of the specific way adopted to maximise it .",
    "therefore , there is no magic heuristic that can circumvent this issue .",
    "the louvain method  @xcite has been held as one such magic heuristic .",
    "the method performs a greedy optimisation of @xmath284 in a hierarchical manner , by assigning each vertex to the community of their neighbours yielding the largest @xmath284 , and creating a smaller weighted super - network whose vertices are the clusters found previously .",
    "partitions found on this super - network hence consist of clusters including the ones found earlier , and represent a higher hierarchical level of clustering .",
    "the procedure is repeated until one reaches the level with largest modularity . in the comparative analysis of clustering algorithms performed by lancichinetti and fortunato on the lfr benchmark  @xcite ,",
    "the louvain algorithm was the second best - performing method , after infomap  @xcite .",
    "this has given the impression that the peculiar strategy of the method solves the resolution problems above , which is not true .",
    "the reason why the performance is so good is that lancichinetti and fortunato adopted the lowest partition of the hierarchy , the one with the smallest clusters  @xcite . by using the partition with highest modularity performance",
    "degrades considerably ( fig .",
    "[ louvainl ] ) , as expected . as suggested by the developers of the algorithm themselves , using the lowest level helps avoiding unnatural community mergers ; as an example , they showed that the natural partition of the ring of cliques ( fig .",
    "[ reslim ] ) can be recovered this way .     and @xmath300 vertices ) and of the range of community sizes ( label @xmath301 indicates that communities have between @xmath302 and @xmath215 vertices , label @xmath62 that they have between @xmath303 and @xmath304 vertices ) .",
    "accuracy is calculated via the normalised mutual information ( nmi ) , in the version by lancichinetti , fortunato and kertsz  @xcite .",
    "results are heavily depending on the hierarchical level one chooses at the end of the procedure .",
    "when one picks the top level ( diamonds ) , which is the one with largest modularity , the accuracy is poor , as expected , especially when communities are smaller .",
    "when one goes for the bottom level ( squares ) , which has lower modularity and smaller clusters than the top level partition , there is a far better agreement with the planted partition and the performance gets closer to that of infomap ( circles ) .",
    "the squares follow the performance curves used in the comparative analysis by lancichinetti and fortunato  @xcite .",
    "courtesy from andrea lancichinetti . ]    however , the bottom level has lower modularity than the top level , so we face a sort of contradiction , in that users are encouraged to use suboptimal partitions , even though one assumes that the best clustering corresponds to the highest value of the quality function , which is what the method is supposed to find .",
    "there is no guarantee that the bottom level yields the most meaningful solution .",
    "on the other hand , users have the option of choosing among a few partitions and a slightly higher chance to find what they search for",
    ".    moreover , the modularity landscape is characterised by a larger than exponential of graph vertices . ]",
    "number of distinct partitions , whose modularity values are very close to the global maximum  @xcite . this explains why many heuristic methods of modularity maximisation are able to come very close to the global maximum of @xmath284 , but it also implies that the global maximum is basically impossible to find .",
    "in addition , high-@xmath284 partitions are not necessarily similar to each other , despite the proximity of their modularity scores .",
    "the optimal structural partition , which may not correspond to the modularity maximum due to problems exposed above , may however have a large @xmath284-value .",
    "therefore the optimal partition is basically indistinguishable from a huge number of high - modularity partitions , which are in general structurally dissimilar from it .",
    "the large structural diversity of high - modularity partitions implies that one can not rely on any of them , at least in principle .",
    "reliable solutions could be singled out when the domain user imposes some constraints on the clustering of the system , or when she expects it to have specific features . in the absence of additional information or expectations ,",
    "consensus clustering could be used to derive more robust partitions .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the consensus of many high - modularity partitions , combined with a hierarchical approach , could help to solve resolution problems and to avoid to find communities in random graphs without groups  @xcite .    as of today",
    ", modularity optimisation is still the most used clustering technique in applications .",
    "this may appear odd , given the serious issues of the method and the fact that nowadays more powerful techniques are available , like a posteriori stochastic block modelling ( section  [ sec - wmt ] ) .",
    "indeed newman has proven that optimising modularity is equivalent to maximising the likelihood that the planted partition model reproduces the network  @xcite .",
    "but the planted partition model is a very specific case of the general stochastic block model , in that the intra - group edge probabilities are all equal to the same value @xmath65 and the inter - group edge probabilities are all equal to the same value @xmath112 .",
    "there is no reason to limit the inference to this specific case , when one could use the full model .",
    "optimising partition quality functions may lead to resolution problems , just like it happens for modularity , i. e. , the partition found when the detection is performed only on @xmath301  @xcite .",
    "this is possible when the coefficients of the summand corresponding to each community does not depend on global properties of the graph .",
    "even those functions have their own preferential community scale , though . ] .",
    "instead , one could try to optimise _ cluster quality functions_. one starts with some function @xmath305 expressing how  community - like \" a subgraph is and with a seed vertex @xmath84 .",
    "the goal is to build a cluster @xmath306 including @xmath84 such that @xmath307 is maximum .",
    "this is usually done by exploring the neighbours of the temporary subgraph @xmath306 , starting from the neighbours of @xmath84 when @xmath306 includes only @xmath84 .",
    "the neighbouring vertex whose inclusion yields the largest increase of @xmath75 is added to the subgraph .",
    "when a new vertex is included , the structure of the subgraph is altered and the other vertices can be examined again , as it might be advantageous to knock some of them out .",
    "the process stops when the quality @xmath307 can not be increased anymore via the inclusion or the exclusion of vertices .",
    "the optimisation of cluster quality functions offers a number of advantages over the optimisation of partition quality functions .",
    "first , it is consistent with the idea that communities are local structures , which are sensitive to what happens in their neighbourhood , but are fairly unaffected by the rest of the network : the structure of a social circle in europe is hardly influenced by the dynamics of social circles in australia , though they are parts of the same global social network of humans .",
    "consequently , if a network undergoes structural changes in one region , community structure is altered and is to be recovered only in that region , while the clustering of the rest of the network remains the same . by optimising partition quality functions , instead",
    ", any little change may have an effect on every community of the graph .",
    "second , since cluster quality functions do not embody any global scale , severe resolution problems are usually avoided .",
    "moreover , one can investigate only parts of the network , which is particularly valuable when the graph is large and a global analysis would be out of reach , computationally .",
    "the local exploration of the graph allows to reach vertices already assigned to clusters , so overlaps can be naturally detected . in the last years several algorithms based on the optimisation of cluster quality functions",
    "have been designed  @xcite .",
    "communities can also be identified by running dynamical processes on the network , like diffusion  @xcite , spin dynamics  @xcite , synchronisation  @xcite , etc .. in this section we focus on diffusion and spin dynamics , that inform most approaches .",
    "random walk dynamics is by far the most exploited in community detection . if communities have high internal edge density and are well - separated from each other , random walkers would be trapped in each cluster for quite some time , before finding a way out and migrating to another cluster .",
    "we briefly discuss two broad classes of algorithms : methods based on vertex similarity and methods based on the map equation .",
    "the first class of techniques consists in using random walk dynamics to estimate the similarity between pairs of vertices .",
    "for instance , in the popular method _ walktrap _ the similarity between vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 is given by the probability that a random walker moves from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in a fixed number of steps @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 has to be large enough , to allow for the exploration of a significant portion of the graph , but not too big , as otherwise one would approach the stationary limit in which transition probabilities trivially depend on the degrees of the vertices .",
    "if there is a pronounced community structure , pairs of vertices in the same cluster are much more easily reachable by a random walk than pairs of vertices in different clusters , so the vertex similarity is expected to be considerably higher within groups than between groups of the graph , whose element @xmath308 equals the probability that a random walker , sitting at @xmath11 , moves to @xmath10 ; raising the elements of the resulting matrix to a power , such that the larger values are enhanced with respect to the smaller ones , many of which are set to zero to lighten the calculations , while the remaining ones are normalised by dividing them by the sum of elements of their column , yielding a new transfer matrix .",
    "the process eventually reaches a stationary state , corresponding to the matrix of a disconnected graph , whose connected components are the sought clusters . ] . in that case , clusters can be readily identified via standard hierarchical or partitional clustering techniques  @xcite .",
    "this class of methods have a high computational complexity , higher than quadratic in the number @xmath2 of vertices ( on sparse graphs ) , so they can not be used on large networks . besides , they are often parameter - dependent .",
    "the map equation stems from a seminal paper by rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite , who asked what is the most parsimonious way to describe an infinitely long random walk taking place on the graph .",
    "the information content of any description is given by the total number of bits required to indicate the various stages of the process .",
    "the simplest description is obtained by listing sequentially all vertices reached by the random walker , each vertex being described by a unique codeword . however ,",
    "if the network has a community structure , there may be a more compact description , which follows the principle of geographic maps , where there are multiple cities and streets with the same name across regions .",
    "vertex codewords could be recycled among different communities , which play the role of regions / states , and vertices with identical name are distinguished by specifying the community they belong to .",
    "if clusters are well separated from each other , transitions between clusters are infrequent , so it is advantageous to use the map , with the communities as regions , because in the description of the random walk the codewords of the clusters will not be repeated many times , while there is a considerable saving in the description due to the limited length of the codewords used to denote the vertices ( fig .",
    "[ figinfomap ] ) .",
    "the map equation yields the description length of an infinite random walk consists of two terms , expressing the shannon entropy of the walk within and between clusters . the best partition is the one yielding the minimum description length .",
    "this method , called infomap , can be applied to weighted networks , both undirected and directed . in the latter case ,",
    "random walk dynamics is modified by introducing a teleportation probability , as in the pagerank process  @xcite , to ensure that a non - trivial stationary state is reached .",
    "it has been successively extended to the detection of hierarchical community structure  @xcite and of overlapping clusters  @xcite . in classic random",
    "walks the probability of reaching a vertex only depends on where the walker stands , not on where it is coming from .",
    "the map equation has also been extended to random walks whose transition probabilities depend on earlier steps too ( higher - order markov dynamics )  @xcite , retaining memory of the ( recent ) past .",
    "applications show that in this way one can recover overlapping communities more easily than by using standard first - order random walk dynamics , especially pervasive overlaps , which are usually out of reach for most clustering algorithms ( section  [ ncp ] ) .",
    "infomap and its variants usually return different partitions than structure - based methods ( e. g. , modularity optimisation ) .",
    "this is because they are based on flows running across the system , as opposed to structural variables like number of edges , vertex degrees , etc .. the difference is particularly striking on directed graphs  @xcite , where edge directions heavily constrain the possible flows .",
    "structural features obviously play a major role on the dynamics of processes running on graphs , but dynamics can not be generally reduced to an interplay of structural elements , at least not simple ones like , e. g. , vertex degrees . sometimes structural and dynamic approaches are equivalent , though . for instance , newman - girvan s modularity is a special case of a general quality function , called _ stability _ , expressing the persistence of a random walk within communities  @xcite .",
    "the methods we have discussed so far are global , in that they aim at finding the whole community structure of the system .",
    "however , random walks along with other dynamical processes can be used as well to explore the network locally , starting from seed vertices  @xcite .",
    "good communities correspond to bottlenecks of the dynamics and depend on the choice of the seed vertices , the time scale of the dynamics , etc .. such local perspective enables to identify community overlaps in a natural way , due to the possibility of reaching vertices multiple times , even if they are already classified .",
    "spin dynamics  @xcite are also regularly used in network clustering .",
    "the first step is to define a spin model on the network , consisting of a set of spin variables @xmath309 , assigned to the vertices and a hamiltonian @xmath310 , expressing the energy of the spin configuration @xmath311 . for community detection ,",
    "spins are usually integers : @xmath312 .",
    "contributions to the energy are usually given by spin - spin interactions .",
    "the coupling of a spin - spin interaction can be _",
    "ferromagnetic _ ( negative ) or",
    "_ antiferromagnetic _ ( positive ) , if the energy is lower when the spins are equal or not , respectively .",
    "the goal is to find those spin configurations that minimise the hamiltonian @xmath310 .",
    "if couplings are all ferromagnetic , the minimum energy would be trivially obtained for the configurations where all vertices have identical spin values .",
    "instead , one would like to have identical spins for vertices of the same cluster , and different spins for vertices in different clusters , to identify the community structure .",
    "therefore , hamiltonians feature both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions [ _ spin glass dynamics _  @xcite ] .",
    "a popular model consists in rewarding edges between vertices in the same cluster , as well as non - edges between vertices in different clusters , and penalising edges between vertices of different clusters , along with non - edges between vertices in the same cluster . this way , if the edge density within communities is appreciably larger than the edge density between communities , as it often happens , having equal spin values for vertices in the same cluster would considerably lower the energy of the configuration . on the other hand , to bring the energy further down the spins of vertices in different clusters should be different , as many such vertices would be disjoint from each other , and such non - edges would increase the energy of the system if the corresponding spin variables were equal .",
    "a general expression for the hamiltonian along these lines is  @xcite @xmath313\\delta(s_i , s_j)\\ , , \\label{eqrbgen}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the element of the adjacency matrix , @xmath314 are arbitrary coefficients , and the kronecker delta selects only the pairs of vertices with the same spin value .    a popular model is obtained by setting @xmath315 and @xmath316 , where @xmath299 is a tunable parameter and @xmath276 a null model term , expressing the expected number of edges running between vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 under a suitable randomisation of the graph structure .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath317 if @xmath318 and @xmath279 , @xmath18 ( @xmath121 ) being the degree of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath3 the total number of graph edges , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqrb ] ) coincides with the modularity by newman and girvan [ eq .  ( [ eq : mod ] ) ] , up to an irrelevant multiplicative constant .",
    "consequently , modularity can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of a spin glass as well .    by setting @xmath319 and @xmath320",
    "we obtain the _ absolute potts model _ ( apm )  @xcite , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath321\\delta(s_i , s_j)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqapm}\\ ] ] here , there is no null model term .",
    "the models of eqs .",
    "( [ eqrb ] ) and ( [ eqapm ] ) can be trivially extended to weighted graphs  @xcite .",
    "they allow to explore the network at different resolutions , by suitably tuning the parameter @xmath299 .",
    "however , there usually is no information about the community sizes , so it is not possible to decide _ a priori _ the proper value(s ) of @xmath299 for a specific graph .",
    "a common heuristic is to estimate the _ stability _ of partitions as a function of @xmath299 .",
    "it is plausible that partitions recovered for a given @xmath299-value will not be disrupted if @xmath299 is varied a little .",
    "so , the whole range of @xmath299 can be split into intervals , each interval corresponding to the most frequent partition detected in it .",
    "good candidates for the unknown community structure of the system could be the partitions found in the widest intervals of @xmath299 , as they are likely to be more stable ( or robust ) than the other partitions .",
    "however , the results of the algorithm do not usually have a linear relationship with @xmath299 , hence the width of the intervals is not necessarily correlated with stability , as intervals of the same width but centred at different values of @xmath299 may have rather different importance .    a good operational definition of stability is based on the stochastic character of optimisation methods , which typically deliver different results for the same system and set of parameters , by changing initial conditions and/or random seeds . if a partition is robust in a given range of @xmath299-values , most partitions delivered by the algorithm will be very similar . on the other hand ,",
    "if one explores a @xmath299-region in between two strong partitions , the algorithm will deliver the one or the other partition and the individual replicas will be , on average , not so similar to each other .",
    "so , by calculating the similarity @xmath322 of partitions found by the method at a given resolution parameter @xmath299 ( for different choices of initial conditions and random seeds ) , stable communities are revealed by peaks of @xmath322  @xcite . since clustering in large graphs can be very noisy , peaks may not be well resolved .",
    "noise can be reduced by working with consensus partitions of the individual partitions returned by the method for a given @xmath299 ( section  [ sec - consensus ] ) .",
    "these manipulations are computationally costly , though .",
    "besides , multi - resolution techniques may miss relevant cluster sizes , as it happens for multi - resolution modularity  @xcite ( section  [ sec - modopt ] ) .",
    "due to the increasing availability of time - stamped network data , there is currently a lot of activity on the development of methods to analyse temporal networks  @xcite . in particular , the problem of detecting dynamic communities has received a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "clustering algorithms used for static graphs can be ( and often are ) used for dynamic networks as well .",
    "what needs to be established is how to handle the evolution .",
    "typically one can describe it as a succession of _ snapshots _ @xmath323 , where each snapshot @xmath324 corresponds to the configuration of the graph in a given time window .",
    "there are two possible strategies .",
    "the simplest approach is to detect the community structure for each individual snapshot , which is a static graph  @xcite .",
    "next , pairs of communities of consecutive windows are associated .",
    "a standard procedure is finding the cluster @xmath325 in window @xmath97 that is most similar to cluster @xmath326 in window @xmath99 , for instance by using jaccard similarity score [ eq .  ( [ eqt20 ] ) ]  @xcite .",
    "this way every community has an image in each phase of the network evolution and one can track its dynamics .",
    "various scenarios are possible .",
    "communities may disappear at some point and new communities may appear , following the exclusion or the introduction of vertices and edges , respectively .",
    "furthermore , a cluster may fragment into smaller ones or merge with others .",
    "however , since snapshots are handled separately , this strategy often produces significant variations between partitions close in time , especially when the data sets are noisy , as it usually happens in applications",
    ".    it would be preferable to have a unified framework , in which communities are inferred both from the current structure of the graph and from the knowledge of the community structure at previous times .",
    "an interesting implementation of this strategy is _ evolutionary clustering",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the approach is finding a partition that is both faithful to the system configuration at snapshot @xmath97 and close to the partition derived for the previous snapshot @xmath98 .",
    "a cost function is introduced , whose optimisation yields a tradeoff between such two constraints .",
    "there is ample flexibility on how this can be done , in practice .",
    "many known clustering techniques normally used for static graphs can be reformulated within this evolutionary framework . some interesting algorithms based on evolutionary clustering",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "mucha et al .",
    "have also presented a method that couples the system s configurations of different snapshots , within a modularity - based framework  @xcite . in the resulting quality function ( _ multislice modularity _ ) , all configurations are simultaneously taken into account and the coupling between them is expressed by a tunable parameter .",
    "the approach can handle general multilayer networks  @xcite , where layers are either networks whose vertices are connected by a specific edge type ( e. g. , friendship , work relationships , etc .",
    ", in social networks ) , or networks whose vertices have connections ( interactions , dependencies ) with the vertices of other networks / layers . on the other hand , since the approach is based on modularity optimisation , it has the drawbacks exposed in section  [ sec - modopt ] .",
    "consensus clustering ( section  [ sec - consensus ] ) is a natural approach to find stable dynamic clusterings by combining multiple snapshots .",
    "let us suppose we have a time range going from @xmath327 to @xmath328 , that we want to divide into @xmath329 windows of size @xmath330 . for the sake of stability , one should consider sliding windows , i. e. , overlapping time intervals .",
    "this way consecutive partitions will be based on system configurations sharing a lot of vertices and edges , and change is ( typically ) smooth . in order to have exactly @xmath329 frames ,",
    "each of them has to be shifted by an interval @xmath331 with respect to the previous one .",
    "so we obtain the windows @xmath332 $ ] , @xmath333 $ ] , @xmath334 $ ] , ... , @xmath335 $ ] .",
    "the community structure of each snapshot can be found via any reliable static clustering technique .",
    "next , the consensus partition from the clusterings of @xmath83 consecutive snapshots , with @xmath83 suitably chosen , is derived  @xcite .",
    "again , one could consider sliding windows : for instance , the first window could consist of the first @xmath83 snapshots , the second one by those from @xmath216 to @xmath336 , and so on until the interval spanned by the last @xmath83 snapshots . in fig .",
    "[ dyncons ] we show an application of this procedure on the citation network of papers published in journals of the american physical society ( aps ) .",
    "years , except at the right end of each diagram : since there is no data after @xmath337 , the last windows must have @xmath337 as upper limit , so their size shrinks ( @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 , @xmath341 ) .",
    "each vertical bar represents a consensus partition combining pairs of consecutive snapshots .",
    "a color uniquely identifies a community , the width of the links between clusters is proportional to the number of papers they have in common .",

    "complex networks _ is clearly visible , as well as its later split into a number of smaller subtopics , like _ community structure _ , _ epidemic spreading _ , _ robustness _ , etc .. reprinted figure with permission from  @xcite .",
    "2012 , by the nature publishing group . ]",
    "an alternative way to uncover the evolution of communities by accounting for the correlation between configurations of neighbouring time intervals is to use probabilistic models  @xcite .",
    "if the system is large and its structure is updated in a stream fashion , instead of working on snapshots one could detect the clustering _ online _",
    ", every time the configuration of the system varies due to new information , like the addition of a new vertex or edge  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that change is due to the effect that the small variation in the network structure has on the system , and it can be tracked by simply adjusting the partition of the previous configuration , which can be usually done rather quickly .",
    "let us suppose that we have identified the communities , somehow .",
    "are we done ?",
    "unfortunately , things are not that simple .          in fig .",
    "[ figrand0 ] ( top left ) we show the adjacency matrix of the random graph  la erds - rnyi illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : stylized - random ] .",
    "the graph has @xmath342 vertices , so the matrix is @xmath343 .",
    "black dots indicate the existence of an edge between the corresponding vertices , while missing edges are represented in white . by construction",
    ", there is no group structure .",
    "however , we can rearrange the elements of the matrix , by reordering the vertex labels . in fig .",
    "[ figrand0 ] ( top right ) we see that , by doing that , one can generate a group structure , of the assortative type , with two blocks of equal size .",
    "if we increase the number of blocks to three fig .",
    "[ figrand0 ] ( bottom left ) and ten fig .",
    "[ figrand0 ] ( bottom right ) we can make the matrix look more and more modular .",
    "this is why many clustering techniques detect communities in random networks as well , though they should not .",
    "where do the groups come from ?",
    "since they can not be real by construction , they must be generated by random fluctuations in the network construction process .",
    "random fluctuations are particularly relevant on sparse graphs ( section  [ detectab ] ) .",
    "the lesson we learn from this example is that it is not sufficient to identify groups in the network , but one should also ask _ how significant _ , or non - random , they are .",
    "unfortunately , most clustering algorithms are not able to assess the significance of their results .",
    "if the groups are compatible with random fluctuations , they are not proper groups and should be disregarded . the lower the chance that they are generated by randomness , the more confident we can be that the blocks reflect some actual group structure .",
    "naturally , this can be done only if one has a reliable _ null model _ , describing how the structure of the network at study can be randomised and allowing us to estimate how likely it is that the candidate group structure is generated this way .",
    "the configuration model  @xcite is a popular null model in the literature .",
    "it generates all possible configurations preserving the number of vertices and edges of the network at study , and the degrees of its vertices .",
    "one may compute some variables of the original network , and estimate the probability that the model reproduces them , or _",
    "p - value _ , i. e. , the fraction of model configurations yielding values of the variables compatible with those measured on the original graph .",
    "if the p - value is sufficiently low ( @xmath344 is a standard threshold ) , one concludes that the property at study can not be generated by randomness only . for community structure , one can compute various properties of the clusters , e. g. , their internal density , and compare them with the model values .",
    "some clustering algorithms , like oslom  @xcite are based on this principle . along the same lines",
    ", @xmath173-scores can be used as well [ see the example of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zscore ] ) ] .",
    "degree - corrected stochastic block models  @xcite ( section  [ sec - inference ] ) also include the configuration model , which corresponds to the case without group structure ) . ] . in this case",
    "significance can be estimated by doing model selection between the versions with and without blocks ( section  [ sec - inference ] ) .",
    "a concept very related to significance is that of _",
    "robustness_. if clusters are significant it means that they are resilient if the network structure is perturbed , to some extent .",
    "one way to quantitatively assess this is introducing into the system a controlled amount of noise , and checking how much noise it takes to disrupt the group structure",
    ". the greater the required perturbation , the more robust the communities . for instance , a perturbation could be rewiring a fraction of randomly chosen edges  @xcite . after the network is perturbed , the community structure is derived and compared to the one of the original network . the trend of the partition similarity shows how the group structure responds to perturbations .",
    "a similar approach consists in sampling network configurations from a population which the original network is supposed to belong to ( _ bootstrapping _ ) , and comparing the clusterings found in those configurations , to check how frequently subsets of vertices are clustered together in different samples , which is an index of the robustness ( significance ) of their clusters  @xcite .      at the end of the day , what most people want to know is : which method shall i use on my data ?",
    "since the clustering problem is ill - defined , there is no clear - cut answer to it .",
    "popular techniques are based on similar ideas of communities , like the ones we reviewed in sections  [ sec - defs ] and [ sec - mv ] .",
    "what makes the difference is the way clusters are sought .",
    "the specific procedure affects the reliability of the results ( e. g. , because of resolution problems ) and the time complexity of the calculation , determining the scope of the method and constraining its applicability .",
    "most methods propose a universal recipe , that is supposed to hold on every data set . in so doing ,",
    "one neglects the peculiarities of the network at study , which is valuable information that could orient the method towards more reliable solutions . but algorithms are usually not so flexible to account for specific network features .",
    "for instance , in some cases , there is no straightforward extension capable to handle high - level features like edge direction or overlapping communities .",
    "validation of algorithms , like the comparative analysis of  @xcite , have allowed to identify a set of methods that perform well on artificial benchmarks .",
    "there are two important issues , though .",
    "first , we do not know how well real networks are described by currently used benchmark models .",
    "therefore , there is no guarantee that methods performing well on benchmarks also give reliable results on real data sets .",
    "structural analyses like the ones discussed in section  [ ncp ] might allow to identify more promising benchmark models .",
    "second , if we rely so much on current benchmarks , which are versions of the stochastic block model ( sbm ) , we already know what the best method is : a posteriori block modelling , i. e. , fitting a sbm on the data .",
    "indeed , there are several advantages to this approach .",
    "it is more general , it does not only discover communities but several types of group structures , like disassortative groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stylized - bipartite ] ) and core - periphery structure ( fig .  [ fig : stylized - coreper ] ) .",
    "it can also capture the existence of hierarchies among the clusters .",
    "moreover , it yields much richer results than standard clustering algorithms , as it delivers the entire set of parameters of the most likely sbm , with which one can construct the whole network , instead of just grouping vertices .",
    "sbms are very versatile as well .",
    "they can be extended to a variety of contexts , e. g. , directed networks  @xcite , networks with weighted edges  @xcite , with overlapping communities  @xcite , with multiple layers  @xcite , with annotations  @xcite . besides",
    ", the procedure can be applied to any network model with group structure , not necessarily sbms .",
    "the choice between alternative models can be done via model selection .",
    "a posteriori block modelling is not among the fastest techniques available .",
    "networks with millions of vertices and edges could be investigated this way , but very large networks remain out of reach . fortunately , many networks of interest can be attacked .",
    "the biggest problem of this class of methods , i. e. , the determination of the number of clusters , seems to be solvable ( section  [ sec - inference ] ) .",
    "we recommend to exploit the power of this approach in applications .",
    "algorithms based on the optimisation of cluster quality functions should be considered as well ( section  [ sec - modopt ] ) , because they may avoid resolution problems and explore the network locally , which is often the only option when the system is too large to be studied as a whole .",
    "algorithms based on the optimisation of partition quality functions , like modularity maximisation , are plagued by the problems we discussed in section  [ sec - modopt ] .",
    "nevertheless , if one knows , or discovers , the correct number of clusters @xmath75 , and the optimisation is constrained on the subset of partitions having @xmath75 clusters , such algorithms become competitive  @xcite .",
    "we also encourage to use approaches based on dynamics ( section  [ sec - dynmet ] ) . in principle , the resulting clustering depends on the specific dynamics adopted . in practice",
    ", there often is a substantial overlap between the clusters found with different dynamics .",
    "an important question is whether dynamics may uncover groups that are not recoverable from network structure alone .",
    "differences in the clusterings found via dynamical versus structural approaches could be due to the fact that dynamical processes are sensitive to more complex structural elements than edges ( e. g. , paths , motifs )  @xcite ( section  [ sec - mv ] ) .",
    "however , even if that were true , dynamical approaches could be more natural ways to handle such higher - order structures , and to make sense of the resulting community structure .    in general",
    ", however , the final word on the reliability of a clustering algorithm is to be given by the user , and any output is to be taken with care .",

    "<S> community detection in networks is one of the most popular topics of modern network science . </S>",
    "<S> communities , or clusters , are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups , though other patterns are possible . identifying communities is an ill - defined problem . </S>",
    "<S> there are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients , like the definition of community itself , nor on other crucial issues , like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances . </S>",
    "<S> this has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions , which undermine the progress in the field . </S>",
    "<S> we offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out strengths and weaknesses of popular methods , and give directions to their use . </S>"
