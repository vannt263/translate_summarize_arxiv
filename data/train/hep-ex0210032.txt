    "@xmath27 mesons in dis can be either formed directly from @xmath1 quarks inside the proton or indirectly from @xmath1 quarks produced via bgf or in the hadronization process . generally , the cross section for indirect production is much larger than that for the direct one , rendering the measurement of the @xmath1-quark content of the proton rather difficult .",
    "however , for direct @xmath27 production the variable @xmath28 clusters around 1 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath27 momentum in the breit frame . therefore , at high @xmath30 inclusive @xmath27 production is sensitive to the @xmath1-quark content of the proton .",

    "the acceptance of the zeus main detector for scattered electrons is limited towards small scattering angles to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "one possibility to measure @xmath2 at even lower @xmath14 values is to use initial - state radiative ( isr ) events where a photon was radiated from the incoming lepton . due to the energy carried by the photon , @xmath41 , @xmath9 of the reaction",
