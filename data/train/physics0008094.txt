    "so far this method has only left intriguing consequences , however it diverges from the point made earlier in this section .    in string theory",
    "the atomism view of matter is replaced with vibrating strings , these vibrating strings correspond to a real geometry .",

    "these imaginary components thus make the string a complex function , yielding a pseudo point - like string . to analyze this premise",
    "allow us to view the nambu - goto action @xmath13 .",

    "this production is made possible through the non communacating mathematics associated with quantum mechanics .",
    "as the particles are produced they destroy one another , such that their world - sheets reverberate in a complex form .",
    "this complex reverberations in @xmath1-dimensions is responsible for the vibration of the string , which we navely associate with mass .",
    "electromagnetic waves are the result of four - dimensional interactions , and its real wave would correspond to the results found in classical mechanics .",
    "however , it would intern have a fractal complex field , which would cause the field to break periodically yielding a string fragment , a quanta .",
    "this quanta in non self regulating , i.e. it is the nature of the real wave which causes the string to reverberate .",
    "the above consideration may carry some controversy in the well known theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "if a quanta is just a fractal string , then what is the proper approach for the exchange of energy between the two systems ?",
    "well , the result appears as classical approximation , the quanta hits the string as a solid body , causing a change in geometry , which virtual particles oppose .",
    "this causes the string to  bounce \" back to its original form , emitting a real wave , but not necessarily a quanta , remember a quanta is given by a complex field .",
    "since quantum mechanics is sketched out onto a point particle - like environment , its consequences would agree with the qed model .",
    "in fact the fractal model yields a much physical picture for non communacating relationships than the quantum theory .",
    "the above result would agree with qed , however , its definitions are quite weak , in fact one may expand these definitions to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "thus a nucleon may be made to reflect electromagnetic radiation as well , however , this dose not defy the documented experiments in any magnitude .",

    "each string fragment consist of its own local vibrations ( gauge invariance ) , which attributes its mass , i.e. differentiates between a higgs particle and a quark .",
    "these states then have their own local statistics , their real waves would then correspond differently than the electromagnetic field . which results in the production of the celebrated yang - mills field , and thus yields the production of colored particles such as the gluon .",
    "cantor pioneered the study of infinities with his new theory of cardinal numbers , however he faced opposition in his time for this new theory .",

    "the hp relates that the universe may exist in dimensions of infinitum status .",
    "however , the laws of physics are best projected onto a pseudo two - dimensional screen , and our three - dimensional world is only a pseudo manifestation of an @xmath1-dimensional continuum . in string theory",
    "we can view our universe as made up of two two - dimensional branes ( described by type iia d2 membranes ) .",
    "thus any other dimension outside the holographic conjecture yields no physical meaning and no solution .",
    "just as what is suggested by fermat s last theorem , therefore our four dimensional slice of the brane is a pseudo physical manifestation of the holographic screen . there is only one explanation for this result , there must exist a physical constant for specified energy scales , i.e. the planck scale . here",
    "another coincidence appears to arrive , the two dimensional wave equation for string theory @xmath16 .",
    "it seems that both mathematically and physically there is a special importance with dimension 2 .",
    "this discussion is largely philosophical , however it is interesting to note that _ cardinal strings are given by complex numbers .",

    "einstein s theory of gr transformed newton s theory of a gravitational force , to a direct consequence of geometry .",
    "however , although the idea of a force was replaced with a geometry , the geometry still yields a force when explained in riemannian geometry . an even more radical approach to gravitation as a geometry was produced by roger penrose in his theory of twistor spaces .",
    "the geometry itself is more important than physical masses , in fact masses only come important when one expands this theory .",
    "this is true for a fractal revision of string theory , it exists as a pure geometry , the interacting geometry in fact produces mass .",
    "this seems almost a radical stance from the point of view of gr , however geometry remains a key factor as the ideal of a force to gr .",
    "the vacuum exist from a state of virtual particles being produced via cardinal string fragments .",
    "since virtual particles are a pure construction of  particles \" in @xmath1-dimensions , they are not true strings ( i.e. they violate the hp ) .",
    "these particles thus carry no mass - energy equivalent within our universe , never the less they still posses a geometry .",
    "this situation only holds true when the system is localized , however , when interacting with non cardinal strings can induce an energy exchange . by the well known casimir effect",
    "the energy of the vacuum should be given by : @xmath17 and when interacting with an inertial mass system we have : @xmath18 this relates the fact that as mass is accelerated it pushes the quantum vacuum energy ( which is analogous to the assumption made be postulate one ) . in other words",
    "it reacts in the same fashion as air molecules do when inertial masses accelerate on earth ( producing pressure on the system ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be assumed that a material body increases its rest mass by absorbing this zero - point - energy ( this assumption must be given in order to satisfy conservation laws ) .",
    "moreover , since they are cardinal strings they are unified in a manner , thus the vacuum is a geometrical manifestation of string particles .",
    "that is the geometrical patterns formed through string interactions is what we call a gravitational field , i.e. a virtual gravitational field .",
    "since these string interactions are only virtual there is no reason to modify the einstein field equation , unless one wishes to discuss quantum string effects .",
    "furthermore @xmath1-dimensional spacetime metrics have shown to be very similar to the structure of four - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "therefore the classical gravitational field is removed from quantum mechanics as it exist in a virtual sense , thus quantum mechanics is a property of matter , i.e. interacting geometries .",
    "the vacuum however is not currently treated as the geometry of a fractal spacetime system , and hence is incompatible with other vacuum theories .",
    "however a fractal model for quantum mechanics appears to agree with at least one interpretation of the quantum vacuum .",
    "in fact this interpretation goes right along with loop quantum gravity , and string theory see ref .",
    "the hausdorff ( or fractal ) dimension suggest that dimensions maybe confined to a @xmath19 spacetime , with fractal string scaling .",
    "this principle was postulated earlier in this letter as the consequence of the ",
    "planckian scaling , \" and is the leading postulate in new relativity .",
    "here the importance now becomes what is the meaning of de - broglie phenomenon .",
    "the einstein de - broglie equation @xmath20 can be seen as a representation of the relativistic wave equation , i.e. mass is a quantifiable measure of energy . which can be applied directly to string theory , the vibrations of the string are given in a fractal frequency comparable to the compton wavelength .",
    "> from the above consideration it can be equally applied the the origin of a bodies mass intern comes from the gravitational field itself .",
    "this requires the use of feynman diagrams , and believe it or not this approach is indeed correct , if strings are represented by cardinal numbers ( and if quantum mechanics is considered to be correct ) .",
    "since this allows for ftl communication at the classical level it can be interpreted at least at the quantum level that mass originates from spacetime ( when measured at the planckian scale ) .",
    "in fact at the quantum level the production of virtual particles may be responsible for a light paths geodesic curvature , yielding a quantum gravity theory .",
    "more correctly it may be viewed that the quantum theory is in reality a classical approximation of string theory .",
    "( brussels approximation ) .",
    "quantum mechanics exist as a classical approximation of string interactions which possesses an apparent time reversed symmetry .      deriving this theorem",
    "let us consider the following thought experiment : if mass is composed of vibrating stings , and intern these strings produce gravitational fields in n - dimensions then space is vibrating .",
    "however , such an approach would imply that geometrically speaking the two systems are unaware of their own vibrations under gauge invariance . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of fractal strings are given in a complex field , which itself is anti - communcating .",
    "thus spacetime , or string space is subjected to uncertainty principles as shown in ref . .",
    "since at the classical level , the fractal space can give way to real solutions i now make the assertion that the quantum particles are at flux , and not the space itself ( for argumentative purposes only ) .",
    "therefore when a quantum is observed , it is the space which becomes  fuzzy , \" not the particle , and when not observed the inverse follows .",
    "thus the theorem leads to two possible out comes during an observation sequence .",
    "i ) the fuzzy quantum particle becomes a point particle , when time symmetries are reversed .",
    "ii ) spacetime is fuzzy , however when collapsed by a point particle elucidates to a  natural \" state .",
    "thus it is seen that only when time symmetries are reversed does one obtain the laws commonly associate with quantum mechanics . making the only valid approximation of quantum mechanics the brussels interpretation",
    ", this may also explain the epr paradox .",
    "however our thought experiment does yield one solution which interpretation i and ii are consistent .",
    "when a particle is observed by a frame , it is in reality observed by the local states ( brane ) of the cardinal string , which may be in any number of states . as a point particle ( non local string )",
    "enters the system it begins to collapse the wave function of the local state .",
    "this makes it appear that a fuzzy quantum particle has entered the system , much as a star appears to twinkle in the night sky .",
    "this collapsing of the state i will call the observational s frame  present , \" before the action the observational state was fuzzy .",
    "however , after the event a self organization took place , an event occurred , producing a present state .",
    "after the quanta is observed by the observational frame , its present state then becomes certain in the terminology of classical quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore local brane string interactions can not take place until a non local ( cardinal ) string collapses the wave function of the system .",
    "> from the feynman interpretation of the time reversed symmetries of the gravitational field , new conclusions about the nature of spacetime can be made .",
    "it is here postulated that classical mechanics is in reality a description of a quantum system given under an approximation of a time reversed symmetry .",
    "such that the following statements become true :    * reversal of bohmian mechanics ( bm ) yields classical mechanics * reversal of brussels interpretation ( bi ) yields standard quantum mechanics ( sqm )    with the fractalization of spacetime given in section [ fg ] , we may conclude that ( with the use of bohmian mechanics ) that inertial mass yields an expansion of spacetime .",
    "thus as a body gains mass as it accelerates in classical spacetime it causes the fractalization of the bohmian system to increase ( which is analogous to a lorentz transformation ) . which thus gives the allusion that spacetime is contracting in the classical real frame .",
    "the gravitational force , thus is an inertial acceleration which radiates a pseudo center of gravity vector in terms of newtonian mechanics .",
    "however , this is how we interpret the events classically , in reality it is the expansion of the fractal bohmian space ( the @xmath21 term in section [ fg ] , e.g. the time dimension ) which yields inertial acceleration .    therefore , it is the brussels interpretation of quantum mechanics which yields the epr paradoxes , the connection of the particles is created by the ( incorrect ) approximation of time reversed symmetries . that is to say the epr paradox only includes simple ( non fractal ) states , which by time reversal appears to yield ftl communication ( see figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "this appearance of ftl communication should nt be taken to seriously since recent experiments ( cfr .",
    "wang , et al ) appear to yield ftl communication .",
    "however , it is the string interactions which yield quantum mechanics , in fact it yields the same interpretations as bohmian mechanics .",
    "thus bohmian mechanics adequately describes the behavior of  particles \" while , the brussels interpretations yields standard quantum mechanics [ meaning that this system is only an approximation ] .",
    "since complex spaces have been presented as a solution to the singularity problem , it is natural for a formulation of a complex spacetime . to proceed in this manner",

    "this field can thus transpose to @xmath32 , and couple to an opposing electromagnetic field by the connection @xmath33 which therefore leads to the following antisymmetric riemannian field @xmath34 whence therefore means that there must be an equivocal orthonormal action taking place , such that one has @xmath35 . in which the generic geometry for a perfect fluid becomes that of g^ab=16 gt^_ab which translates to the field equation : r^a_b -1 4g(e_(a ) ) , e_(b))r=-16 g c^4t^_ab this equation must be modified when given in an @xmath1-dimensional system such that on has : r^a_b -1 2(n)g(e_(a),e_(b))r=-8 ( n)g c^2(n)t^_ab [ wfe ] the above equation is in essence a canonical gravitational field equation , which appears to be a good candidate for a quantum gravity theory . where the geodesic equations become - _ [ ] ^ dx^ dx^ ( 1 + _",

    "thus , it is seen that there exist no true ",
    "quantum gravity \" theory .",
    "in fact if one applies this formulation with the planck length it destroys the principle of _ planckian invariance and gives an allusion to the existence of an ther . _      therefore the planck length no longer remains a constant but becomes a dynamical function .",
    "first let us write the planck length in terms of @xmath1-dimensions and apply it to the above field equation such that we have : l_p = ( ^n /m^n _ p c^3n)^1/2n.momentum must be reevaluated from @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 .",
    "thereby the planck length , and mass are actually given by a particles rest momentum .",
    "such that the planck length is in reality given by the function : l_p = ( ^n /m_p_0 ^n c^3n)^1/2n .",
    "this thereby has major implications , that the planck length is not really a constant at all but a function of momentum . such that as an object increase in speed with respect to its rest momentum , its planck energy becomes larger .",
    "that is as a material body is subjected to length contraction , its planckian energy is modified to compensate for the effect . since the momentum is measured at rest m remains a constant , it is the velocity of the system which changes . thereby meaning that length contraction in special relativity is not given by lorentz transformations , but by the local rest momentum of the planck barrier .",
    "this results when we interpreted this action canonically however under bm it yields expected results .",
    "therefore it is seen that a canonical formulation fails to keep  planckian invariance \" which represents a failed attempt at a quantum gravity theory .",

    "alternatively modanese has also predicted a macroscopic quantum gravity effect , however it is limited to the podkletnov experiment .",
    "the formulation of this theory was based on a desire for a reformulation of gr in order to describe a singularity free theory ; in which a fractal formulation of the field equations were derived .",
    "the second desire for this theory was the formulation of a quantum construction of gr , however the end result is a gravity theory which describes quantum mechanics . therefore the gravitational field and matter can be considered to be molded into the following form .",
    "matter exist as a pseudo point particle who s field of movement is restricted onto a two - dimensional ( complex ) frame .",
    "this two - dimensional frame s movement is governed by bm , and in part by the hp .",
    "matter , is thus in reality a fractal vibrating string fragment which continues on into @xmath1-dimensions .",
    "the fractalization of this  cardinal string \" produces virtual particles which posses a geometry , it is this ( virtual ) fractal geometry that is responsible for the gravitational field .    in light of future studies",

    "of course the planck length could be infinitely small in an infinite system , clearly a challenge to the principle of planck invariance .",
    "however , we note that with mach s principle ( mp ) the planck length must be observed by an external mechanism to remain invariant .",
    "thus the planck length exist as a fractalization of bm , which becomes an observational frame in classical real mechanics .",
    "furthermore , from this it may be seen that the laws of physics as we understand them are in direct consequence of the planck length .",

    "however , at the planck scale singularities do nt exist such that the frame interacts via  cardinal strings \" and not classical gr .",
    "thus interactions on local branes cease , and supersymmetry takes over .",
    "only strings which are connected to a form of the d2-brane will have observable physical manifestations , this deals with  planckian invariance \" . in fact each dimension may have its own unique planck length which governs its own local laws ( explaining the limitation of classical string theory to a set number of dimensions ) . which leaves open several areas in @xmath1-dimensional black hole mechanics , and planck length physics .",
    "i have shown that there is enough evidence at present to challenge gr as the correct theory for gravitation .",
    "i have also introduced the study of a complex fractal spacetime system and its possible relationship to the planck length .",
    "the given formulation for a canonical gravitational field resulted in contradictory conclusions , thus ruling out a canonical approach to  quantum gravity . \"",
    "finally if my hypothesizes hold valid then sqm will begin to make invalid predictions for the behavior of particles near the planck length .",
    "thus a fractal correction for sqm will be needed under certain gravitational fields , which may be comparable to bm .",
    "a new weak equivalence principle ( wep ) for the gravitational field can be postulated utilizing a complex fractal minkowski spacetime ( cfms ) system ( see eq.([k ] ) ) .",
    "since there is no spatial acceleration for the gravitational field ( in respect to mp ) , it is the acceleration of the pseudo time dimension in the cfms which produces a gravitational curvature .",
    "therefore a material body would have the traditional minkowski spacetime , acting as a lorentz frame .",
    "since gravitational fields extend indefinitely , this should cause time to continually progress within an inertial acceleration frame .",
    "this therefore means that as an object enters a gravitational field it becomes less massive , in terms of a lorentz transformation .",
    "equivocally it can be stated that energy is lost in curved spacetime .",
    "a similar effect is all ready known , known as a  gravitational time delay , \" i.e. the _ shapiro effect . _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ according to the general theory , the speed of a light wave depends on the strength of the gravitational potential along its path . _",

    "however , the _ principle of relativity is still preserved , because the curvature of spacetime corrects for the cfms .",
    "therefore the reason the _ equivalence principle is fundamental in gr is because it is the only priori condition which satisfies the _ principle of relativity .",
    "thus without an equivalence principle , there would be no relativistic theory for the gravitational field .",
    "_ _ _    the logarithm gravitational time delay , may also be responsible for the apparent  anomalous acceleration \" of spacecraft .",
    "david crawford has offered a similar explanation , where the gravitational term arises from interplanetary dust .",
    "here i now hit upon a topic hinted upon in section [ qedf ] ; converting fractal geometry in the terminology of qcd .",
    "let us now rewrite eq.([rfe ] ) , so that we have an equation of the form : -(r_b ^ca-12g^c_abr^c ) = 8t^c_ab with this equation a yang - mills gravitational pressure can arise under the following field : s_e=14g^2 ^ 4 zf^_f^_+1_ok^ia _",
