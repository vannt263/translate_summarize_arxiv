    "matter wave interferometry is a potent technology in metrology .",
    "atom interferometers have been demonstrated as gyroscopes and accelerometers  @xcite , gravity gradiometers  @xcite , matter - wave clocks  @xcite and may lead to a more accurate measurement of the fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "they also form testbeds for measuring newton s gravitational constant  @xcite , gravitational red - shift  @xcite and for testing universality of free fall  @xcite .",
    "the building block of a conventional raman atom interferometer ( crain ) is a three level atom , with two metastable states , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and an excited state @xmath8 coupled by two counter propagating beams , with a single photon detuning @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) ) .",
    "one of the beams , with rabi frequency @xmath10 , couples @xmath11 to @xmath12 , while the other beam , with rabi frequency @xmath13 , couples @xmath12 to @xmath14 . for @xmath15 , the interaction can be described as an effective two level system excited by an effective traveling wave with a momentum @xmath16 , with a rabi frequency @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) )  @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the decay rate of @xmath20 , so that the effect of @xmath19 can be neglected . under a sequence of @xmath21 pulses ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) ) , the wavepacket first separates into two components , then gets redirected and finally recombined to produce an interference which is sensitive to any phase - difference , @xmath22 between the two paths .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath23 at the end varies as @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "a crain of this type can be realized by employing an atomic beam with a continuous flux , or by employing pulses of atoms pushed out periodically from a magneto - optic - trap ( mot ) .",
    "the behavior of the crain is essentially the same in both modes if the number of atoms interrogated in a given time window is the same .",
    "however , as we will describe later , the collective state atomic interferometer ( cosain ) must operate in the latter ( pulsed ) mode .",
    "thus , for proper comparison we will assume , in the rest of the paper , that the crain is operated in the pulsed mode .",
    "( a ) a three level atom . ( b )",
    "an equivalent reduced two - level atom model .",
    "( c ) a crain produced via @xmath21 sequence of excitation . ]    the phase - difference induced due to rotation at the rate of @xmath25 along an axis normal to the area , @xmath26 of the interferometer is given by , @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the atomic mass  @xcite .",
    "this expression can be derived by two different methods . in the first method ,",
    "the path - difference of the two counter - propagating waves is multiplied by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the de broglie wavelength , to get the phase - difference .",
    "the second method invokes the relativistic addition of velocities to find the time lag , @xmath31 in the arrival of the two branches of the wave , @xmath32 being the speed of light .",
    "@xmath22 is then the product of @xmath33 and the wave frequency . for the crain ,",
    "this frequency is the compton - frequency of the atom , @xmath34 , where the relativistic time - dilation factor , @xmath35 , is close to unity for non - relativistic velocities .",
    "these approaches are equivalent due to the fact that @xmath30 is the laboratory - frame manifestation of the @xmath36 induced phase variation in the rest - frame of the atom  @xcite .",
    "to explain this without loss of generality , let us consider the direction of the velocity of the particle as @xmath37 . for non - relativistic velocities , mixing between the spinors can be ignored , and the phase factor of a positive energy spinor , in the rest frame of the particle , is given simply as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the proper time .",
    "the phase , @xmath41 , is a lorentz invariant parameter , and can in general be written as a contraction between the position four vector @xmath42 and momentum four vector @xmath43 . in the rest frame of the particle , the position four - vector is @xmath44 and the momentum four vector is @xmath45 . in the laboratory frame , the position four vector is , by definition , @xmath46 , and application of lorentz transform shows that the momentum four vector is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and the phase factor becomes @xmath49 . again , in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath50 and we get @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the de broglie wavelength is simply the laboratory frame manifestation of the phase variation in the rest frame due to the compton frequency .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath36 has motivated matter wave interferometry with large molecules . to date , the largest molecule used has a mass of @xmath52 atomic - mass - unit  @xcite , corresponding to the mass of @xmath53cs atoms .",
    "these interferometers , based on the talbot effect , are not suited for rotation sensing .",
    "furthermore , for interferometry with much larger particles it would be necessary to use gratings with spacings too small to be realized with existing technologies . additionally , effects such as van der waals interaction would become dominant for such gratings . here , we propose an experiment that would reveal evidence of matter wave interference where a collection of @xmath1 non - interacting , unentangled atoms acts as a _",
    "single _ particle . for @xmath54rb and @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath36 is @xmath55 ten nonillion hz , and @xmath30 is @xmath55 @xmath2 femtometer at a velocity of @xmath56 m / s .",
    "furthermore , it can improve the phase measurement ability by a factor of as much as @xmath5 .",
    "this type of matter wave interferometry may also open up new opportunities for sensitive measurement of gravitational redshift  @xcite or matter wave clocks  @xcite .",
    "it may also serve as a testbed for macroscopic quantum decoherence due to gravitational redshift  @xcite .",
    "consider an assembly of @xmath1 identical noninteracting atoms , subjected to the @xmath21 sequence .",
    "if we imagine a situation where the ground state , @xmath57 is coupled , directly and only , to the state where all the atoms are in the excited state , @xmath58 , the resulting ensemble interferometer would experience a phase - difference , @xmath59 .",
    "however , existing technology does not enable such an excitation .",
    "even if one were to use a pure fock state of @xmath60 photons , the ensemble would evolve into a superposition of @xmath61 symmetric collective states @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a state of the field with @xmath64 photons , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the permutation operator , and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "since a laser is a superposition of many fock states , the evolution of this system under laser excitation would produce a seemingly intractable superposition of these collective states .",
    "modeling the laser field as a semi - classical one also does not simplify the picture much  @xcite .",
    "however , we show here that , by measuring the quantum state of a single collective state , it is possible to determine the effect of the interference among all the collective states , and describe how such a measurement can be done . choosing this collective state to be one of the two extremal states ( i.e. , @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) also makes it possible to calculate this signal easily , since the state of the whole system can be described as the tensor product of individual atomic states .",
    "we show that the fringe width is reduced by a factor of @xmath0 , without using entanglement . for the current state of the art",
    ", the value of @xmath1 can easily exceed @xmath70 , so that a reduction of fringe width by a factor of more than @xmath71 is feasible .",
    "we also show that the phase fluctuation of the cosain can be significantly smaller , by as much as a factor of @xmath5 , than that for a conventional interferometer employing the same transition and the same atomic flux .",
    "the extremely narrow resonances produced in the cosain may also help advance the field of spin squeezing  @xcite , which in turn is useful for approaching the heisenberg limit in precision metrology .",
    "recently , we have also proposed a collective state atomic clock , which employs the principle of collective excitation of atomic ensemble , and exhibits a similar narrowing in signal fringe  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the various aspects of the collective state atomic interferometer .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ sec : description ] , we describe the theory of the working principle of a cosain .",
    "we also describe the physical phenomenon behind the narrowing of the signal fringes .",
    "[ sec : inhomogeneities ] gives an account of the various parameter inhomogeneities that affect the signal amplitude and width .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] details the description of the cosain experiment , also including a discussion of the role of the optical density of the ensemble .",
    "we also propose an alternate experimental scheme to achieve a higher value of effective optical density in sec .",
    "[ sec : alternate ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , we analyze the performance of the cosain as compared to that of the crain .",
    "we consider the effect of quantum and classical noise , detector efficiency , and collection efficiency .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath1 noninteracting atoms of the kind described above  @xcite , with the @xmath72-th atom in its ground state , @xmath73 .",
    "the ensemble is assumed to be initially situated at @xmath74 and traveling along the @xmath75-direction with a velocity @xmath76 .",
    "the ensemble undergoes the same @xmath21 sequence as described for the crain . assuming resonant excitation , the hamiltonian of the @xmath72-th atom after the rotating - wave transformation is @xmath77  @xcite , where @xmath78 is the rabi frequency of the @xmath72-th atom . here",
    ", a phase transformation on the hamiltonian has also been applied to render @xmath78 real . for the sake of simplicity and brevity , we consider only the case where the intensity profile of the beams are rectangular , so that @xmath79 . in a real experiment ,",
    "the rabi - frequency of each atom depends on its position relative to the gaussian distribution of the beam intensity profile . due to the non - zero temperature of the trapped atoms",
    ", they also experience doppler shift arising from thermal motion .",
    "a detailed description of the effect of these inhomogeneities on the cosain signal is presented in sec .",

    "a @xmath80-pulse of duration @xmath40 is applied to the ensemble at @xmath81 , following which each atom is in state @xmath82 .",
    "after the first dark - zone of duration of @xmath83 , the component of the atom in state @xmath84 drifts to @xmath85 .",
    "the state @xmath73 continues along the * x*-direction .",

    "the state of an atom at @xmath88 is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 . at the end of this zone ,",
    "a @xmath92-pulse causes the state @xmath73 to evolve into @xmath84 and vice - versa .",
    "the state at the end of this pulse is @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 and @xmath95 . following the second dark zone of duration @xmath83 ,",
    "the two trajectories converge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) , and @xmath96 . at @xmath97 , a third pulse of duration @xmath40",
    "is applied to the atoms .",
    "if a phase - difference of @xmath22 is introduced between the paths , the state of the atom at the end of the last @xmath80-pulse is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this phase - difference can occur , for example , due to a rotation of the entire system about the * y*-direction .",
    "the final fringe pattern is the result of the interference of the states from the two trajectories .",
    "this is observed by measuring the probability of finding the atom in either of the two states .",
    "the signal as a measure of the amplitude of @xmath23 , is therefore , @xmath101 .",
    "we note now that the state @xmath102 of the ensemble is the direct product of its constituent atoms : @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "the signal of the cosain is a measurement of any of the arising collective states .",
    "we choose to measure the state @xmath68 , so that the resulting signal is the probability of finding all the atoms of the ensemble simultaneously in @xmath23 .",
    "this choice of state will be explained later on when we discuss the detection system of the cosain .",

    "we have verified that @xmath106 .",
    "the narrowing of the signal fringes in a cosain can be understood by considering the physical properties of the collective excitations .",
    "if the ensemble in the ground state interacts with a single photon of momentum @xmath107 , it will oscillate between @xmath108 .",
    "consequently , it will exhibit collective behavior such that its center of mass recoils with a velocity in the * z*-direction equal to @xmath109 .",

    "the interference between these cosinusoidal fringes result in the narrowing of the total fringe width . in what follows",
    ", we illustrate the physical mechanism behind this narrowing by considering first the role of compton frequency in a crain .",
    "we then extend this analysis to an ensemble of @xmath1 atoms to describe the phenomenon of narrowing in the cosain .",
    "we consider the product state of the atom and a fock state with @xmath124 photons denoted by @xmath125 or with @xmath126 photons denoted by @xmath127 .",

    "thus , the near unity collection efficiency of the cosain can lead to an improvement of the interferometer stability by as much as a factor of 10 .",
    "another method of detecting signal in a crain is absorption .",

    "is affected by additional noise contributed by the laser used in absorption .",
    "let us assume that the observation time is @xmath373 , and the number of photon in the probe beam before absorption is @xmath571 , and that the probe is in a coherent state .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the number of atoms passing through the detection process within this time is @xmath572 , and the linewidth of resonance is @xmath19 . if the detection process produces an absorption by a fraction of @xmath573 ( i.e. @xmath574 represents perfect absorption of the laser beam ) , and the detector has a quantum efficiency of @xmath523 , then the resulting fluctuation in @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath575 where , the first term inside the parenthesis represents the quantum projection noise of the atoms , and the second term represents the shot noise of the photons ( which can be regarded as the quantum projection noise of photons ) .",
    "the validity of this expression can be easily verified by considering various limits .",
    "consider first the ideal case where @xmath576 .",
    "for @xmath577 , the additional noise from the laser can be neglected , and we get the fundamental noise limit due to the quantum projection noise of the atoms . on the other hand , if @xmath578 , the quantum projection noise from the atoms can be neglected , and the process is limited by the shot - noise of the laser . in general , the parameter @xmath579 represents the overall quantum efficiency of the detection process . the corresponding expression for detection via fluorescence is @xmath580 , where @xmath581 is the fraction of fluorescence hitting the detector .    the contribution from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_collection_efficiency_absorption ] ) shows that the intensity of the laser beam used in absorption must be made strong enough in order to make the effect of this term negligible compared to the first term .",
    "however , since the absorption process is nonlinear and saturates for a strong laser beam , increasing the laser intensity often decreases the effective value of @xmath573 .",
    "for example , consider an ensemble of @xmath582 atoms with a linear optical density of @xmath583 , which can be realized ( as we have shown above ) for an ensemble confined to a cigar shaped ensemble .",
    "for a weak probe , the value of @xmath573 is unity .",
    "however , as the probe power is increased , the value of @xmath573 decreases dramatically .",
    "this can be seen by considering a situation where the value of @xmath571 is @xmath584 , for example .",
    "since the atomic transition used for absorption is not closed ( i.e. , not cyclic ) , the ensemble can only absorb a number of photons that is of the order of @xmath585 .",

    "we are not aware of any publication reporting a cold atom interferometer that makes use of absorption for detecting the atoms , possibly because of these constraints and considerations .",
    "nonetheless , as a matter of principle , an absorption process can certainly be used to reduce the quantum frequency fluctuation below what is observed in fluorescence detection systems , under proper choice of parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have described a collective state atomic interferometer ( cosain ) with n non - interacting , independent atoms in an ensemble .",
    "we have shown that the signal fringes are narrowed by @xmath0 compared to a conventional interferometer , without entanglement .",

    "<S> we describe a collective state atomic interferometer ( cosain ) with the signal fringe as a function of phase - difference or rotation narrowed by @xmath0 compared to a conventional interferometer - @xmath1 being the number of atoms - without entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> this effect arises from the interferences among collective states , and is a manifestation of interference at a compton frequency of ten nonillion hz , or a de broglie wavelength of @xmath2 femtometer , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 m / s . </S>",
    "<S> the population of the collective state of interest is detected by a null measurement scheme , in which an event corresponding to detection of zero photons corresponds to the system being in that particular collective state . </S>",
    "<S> the signal is detected by collecting fluorescence through stimulated raman scattering of stokes photons , which are emitted predominantly against the direction of the probe beam , for a high enough resonant optical density . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the ideal cosain is found to be given by the standard quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , when detection efficiency and collection efficiency are taken into account , the detection scheme of the cosain increases the quantum efficiency of detection significantly in comparison to a typical conventional raman atomic interferometer employing fluorescence detection , yielding a net improvement in stability by as much as a factor of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the inhomogeneities arising from the non - uniformity in experimental parameters affect the cosain signal . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe an alternate experimental scheme to enhance resonant optical density in a cosain by using cross - linearly polarized counter - propagating raman beams . </S>"
