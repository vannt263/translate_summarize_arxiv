    "( color online ) the unit cell of the rp ( @xmath3 ) system ( left ) and the ( @xmath4 ) system ( right).,width=8 ]    ruddlesden - popper ( rp ) systems [ ] are compounds of the form a@xmath5b@xmath6c@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an integer , and the valences of the ions are usually a @xmath9 , b @xmath10 and c ( oxygen ) @xmath11 .",
    "systems like srtio@xmath0 can be regarded as being @xmath12 . at high temperatures @xmath13k ,",
    "their crystal structure is tetragonal , consisting of @xmath8-layer units , each layer consisting of vertex sharing oxygen octahedra at whose center sit a b ion , as shown in fig .",
    "( for an alternative illustration , see ref . .",
    "as the temperature is lowered these systems can undergo structural phase transitions into orthorhombic structures .",
    "[ ] these structural transitions usually involve reorientation of oxygen octahedra , a subject which has a long history , [ ] of which the most relevant references for the present paper are those [ ] which deal with the general symmetry aspects of these transitions .",
    "one reason for the continuing interest in octahedral reorientations is because they are important for many interesting electronic properties , such as high-@xmath14 superconductivity , [ ] colossal magnetoresistance , [ ] , metal - insulator transitions , [ ] and magnetic ordering .",
    "[ ]    here we will focus on the @xmath3 rp systems , ca@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( cmo ) and ca@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( cto ) , which present less complex scenarios than the @xmath4 systems .",
    "it seems probable [ ] that well above room temperature the crystal structure of cmo is that of the tetragonal space group i4/mmm , # 139 ( space group numbering is that of ref . ) , and at room temperature that of space group cmc2@xmath15 ( # 36 ) .",
    "[ ] the theory of isotropy subgroups [ ] strongly forbids a direct transition from i4/mmm to cmc2@xmath15 .",
    "in fact , first principles calculations on these systems by benedek and fennie ( bf ) [ ] and on other systems [ ] indicate that the transition from i4/mmm to cmc2@xmath15 should proceed via an intermediate phase which is probably cmcm ( # 63 ) , consistent with ref . .",
    "up to now no such intermediate phase has been observed for cmo or cto . unlike the other phases",
    ", the cmc2@xmath15 phase does not possess a center of inversion symmetry and is allowed to have a spontaneous polarization .",
    "recent measurements on ceramic ca@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 find a clear pyroelectric signal consistent with the onset of ferroelectric order close to @xmath16k .",
    "[ ] therefore @xmath17 is identified as the temperature at which cmc2@xmath15 appears .",
    "since this ferroelectric transition seems to be a continuous and well - developed one and since a direct continuous transition between i4/mmm and cmc2@xmath15 is inconsistent with landau theory , [ ] the seemingly inescapable conclusion is that the phase for @xmath18 slightly greater than @xmath17 is _ not _",
    "i4/mmm , but is some other phase which does not allow a spontaneous polarization .",
    "thus the phase at temperature just above @xmath19k may be the long sought for cmcm phase .",
    "in fact , the cmcm phase has been observed in the isostructural compounds laca@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 [ ] and bi@xmath20ca@xmath21mn@xmath1o@xmath2 [ ] at room temperature . in view of the results of refs . and",
    ", it is possible that the cmcm phase may exist only over a narrow range of temperature . as the temperature is further lowered , an antiferromagnetic phase is observed .",
    "[ ] in this phase , which appears at @xmath22k , [ ] the antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by weak ferromagnetism . [ ]    theoretically , there have been efforts to understand systems like these from first principles calculations .",
    "for instance , ref . found the nearest neighbor exchange @xmath23 within a bilayer to be @xmath24k , giving a curie - weiss @xmath25k , whereas ref .",
    "found @xmath26k .",
    "the former calculation agrees much better with experiment [ ] which gave @xmath27k .",
    "both groups studied the electronic band structure but it was not entirely clear what space group their calculations predicted .",
    "more detailed information on the symmetry of the structures comes from the first principles calculations of bf some of which included spin - orbit interactions .",
    "these calculations give a weak ferromagnetism of @xmath28 per unit cell which is somewhat smaller than @xmath29 per _ spin_. [ ] however , inclusion of spin - orbit interactions enabled bf to obtain the correct symmetry of the magnetoelectric behavior . here",
    "we discuss in detail the symmetry properties of the various phases and experimental consequences such as the interactions between various order parameters ( op s ) and the number and symmetry of the various domains which may be observed .",
    "several of these issues were discussed by bf , but a more complete and systematic analysis is given here .",
    "our approach to symmetry is similar to that of ref . in connection with the aurivillius compound srbi@xmath1ta@xmath1o@xmath30 ( sbto )",
    ": we adopt the high - temperature tetragonal structure as the  reference \" structure and analyze the instabilities at zero temperature which lead to the lower temperature phases .",
    "although cmo and cto do differ from sbto , their crystal symmetry is the same as sbto and hence many of the results we find here are similar to those for sbto .",
    "here we emphasize some of the experimental consequences of the symmetries we find ( such as the enumeration of the different possible structurally ordered domains ) and also we explore the nature of the macroscopic strains , the ferroelectric polarization , the magnetic ordering , and the coupling between structural distortions and these degrees of freedom .",

    "( [ eqmq ] ) we have a magnetic - field dependent contribution to the free energy of the form @xmath381 which indicates that when tetragonal symmetry is broken ( so that @xmath257 is nonzero ) , the magnetic field acts like a field conjugate to the antiferromagnetic op @xmath382 .",
    "consequently , @xmath383 will diverge as the lower transition is approached for @xmath384 or @xmath385 , according to which wave vector has condensed .",
    "this suggests a neutron scattering experiment to measure @xmath333 near the lower transition as a function of the magnitude and direction of @xmath380 .",
    "here we discuss in more detail the possible domain structures and give a brief discussion of the dynamics of domain wall motion .",
    "we first enumerate the various domains of order parameters which can exist as the temperature is lowered through the various phase transitions . as a preliminary",
    "one should note that within a single domain the _ phase _ of an op at wave vector @xmath386 can not be experimentally determined .",
    "however , if more than one such op is present , then their _ relative _ phases can be accessed experimentally . in the discussion that follows we will determine the phase of the op s relative to that of @xmath257 which is not determined .",
    "as the temperature is lowered through @xmath157 , four possible domains are created , with the choices of sign of @xmath257 and the two choices for the wave vector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ domfig ] .",
    "the value of the wave vector within a single domain is experimentally accessible via a scattering experiment .",
    "although the phase of @xmath272 can not be established within a single domain , the fact that different such domains do exist can be established by observation of a domain wall separating domains having the same values of the wave vector . such an experiment to observe a so - called phase domain wall",
    "has recently been done in another system .",
    "[ ]     domains in cmo . at @xmath157 the value of the wave vector @xmath53 and of @xmath272 are selected . at each succeeding transition a two - state order parameter",
    "condenses to further break symmetry .",
    "the domains for positive @xmath272 are macroscopically indistinguishable from those for negative @xmath272 because they differ by a unit translation in the @xmath74-@xmath78 plane .",
    "the signs of the op s @xmath289 and the weak ferromagnetic moment @xmath387 depend on the constants @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) and @xmath61 of eq .",
    "( [ aaeq ] ) . for cto ( which is nonmagnetic ) the section at and below @xmath388 does not apply.,width=8 ]",
    "next , as the temperature is lowered through the lower structural transition at @xmath315 , the op @xmath262 is condensed ( and , as we have seen , is accompanied by @xmath389 ) , giving a total of eight domains , four with @xmath390 and four with @xmath391 . these sets of",
    "four differ from one another only in the inaccessible phase of the op @xmath257 .",
    "however , the four domains having a given sign of @xmath257 can be distinguished from one another , since they correspond to the two choices of wave vector ( which is easily experimentally accessible ) and the two choices of sign of @xmath262 which leads to distinct orientations of the spontaneous polarization ( which is also easily experimentally accessible ) .",
    "finally , when the temperature @xmath388 is reached , the op @xmath392 which describes the antiferromagnetic order is also accessible because it is coupled to the weak ferromagnetic moment . in that way we can identify the 16 domains up to an uncertainty in the sign of @xmath257 . as we indicated above",
    ", the uncertainty is , in principle , accessible in that the phase domain wall can be observed .",
    "note that the transformation @xmath393 leaves the observables @xmath289 , @xmath387 , and @xmath53 invariant .",
    "displacements of the equatorial oxygens as in fig .",

    "the phases to the left and to the right of the domain wall are indistinguishable since they only differ in the phase of the ordering . in this regard",
    "this situation is analogous to domains in an antiferromagnet .",
    "if the domain wall were a perfect plane , there would be no distortion energy of the octahedra .",
    "however , when the wall has a kink , as shown , then there are two possibilities .",
    "first , the tilting a , b , c , d can heal to zero , but this distortion will involve an intraoctahedral distortion of high energy . secondly , it is possible that a , b , c , d ( or analogously e , f , g , h ) will alternate in sign , end at an antikink , so that no intraoctahedral energy is involved , but the tilting of the octahedra is not the lowest energy tilting of the established phase and the energy of the kink is proportional to the distance between the kink and the antikink.,width=8 ]    the above discussion assumes the existence of domains which , unlike ferromagnetic domains , do not have an obvious energetic reason to exist for @xmath394 , where @xmath289 is zero . in particular , the phase domains ,",
    "if they exist , would appear below the upper ordering temperature @xmath157 , where @xmath272 condenses , in which one has , for a given wave vector ( which can be selected by applying a suitable shear stress ) , the two possible choices of sign of @xmath272 .",
    "( color online ) domain walls in cmo for @xmath395 .",
    "here one has low energy 90@xmath149 walls between phases a and b , b and d , and c and d. antiphase regions a and d are separated by two such walls .",
    "if the distance between regions a and d is not too large , it may be possible to establish the existence of phase domains using the technique of ref .",
    ".,width=8 ]    upon cooling through @xmath157 it seems likely that one would have different nucleation sites from which ordering would develop . as a result",
    ", one would have randomly chosen signs of the op @xmath272 in different regions of the sample .",
    "the question then arises , would these domains coarsen and the sample then become a single domain sample ? to answer this question we need to study the energetics of domain walls .",
    "this involves understanding structural defects , as were studied in refs . and .",
    "for this discussion , i first consider the simpler case of an @xmath4 rp system for which the tilt is around a [ 100 ] direction . in fig .",
    "[ dom1 ] a domain wall is shown separating two phases to the left and right of the wall which differ only in their phase .",
    "one sees that if the domain wall is a perfect plane , then there will be no intraoctahedral energy involved in the wall .",
    "indeed , the only energy of the domain wall will be that from the potential that keeps the plane in its location .",
    "however , as explained in the caption to fig .",
    "[ dom1 ] , kink formation requires a large energy .",
    "notice the difference between domain walls in this system and those in an ising antiferromagnet . in an ising antiferromagnet",
    "the domain wall energy is proportional to the length of the wall .",
    "having a kink simply increases the energy by one unit of exchange energy . here a kink either has the nonlocal string - like energy of a kink - antikink or its has the large energy needed to deform the octahedra .",
    "thus , it seems that domain wall motion may be inhibited and therefore it is possible that phase domains , once created will remain in the sample .    from these examples",
    "one concludes that a domain wall tends to form in planes of  minimum contact , \" _",
    "i. e. _ in planes which intersect the least number of shared oxygen ions .",
    "this is why @xmath396 $ ] walls are preferred over @xmath397 $ ] walls for systems , such as cmo , in which tilting occurs about a @xmath397 $ ] direction .",
    "[ ] of course , @xmath398 $ ] walls ( stacking faults ) probably have the least energy .",

    "specifically , we summarize the conclusions from our work as follows    @xmath399 the most important aspect of our work is that we introduce order parameters ( op s ) for all the irreducible representations ( irreps ) for all the wave vectors of the star which is active in the ordering transitions .",
    "the op s describe distortions from the parent high symmetry tetragonal lattice which exists at high temperature .",
    "this enables us to discuss the induced ( nonprimary ) op s such as the spontaneous polarization , the weak ferromagnetism , and the elastic strains .",

    "below that there is an independent magnetic ordering transition to an antiferromagnetic state in which the stacking of the magnetic bilayers depends on the wave vector which was selected when the tetragonal symmetry was broken .",
    "a weak ferromagnetic moment develops perpendicular to both the staggered magnetization and the polarization .",
    "@xmath403 we show that by application of an applied magnetic field it might be possible to reorient the ferromagnetic moment through successive 90@xmath149 rotations , which would then induce similar rotations of the spontaneous polarization .",
    "likewise , application of an external electric field could reorient the spontaneous polarization which in turn would reorient the wave vector and thereby reorient the weak ferromagnetic moment .",
