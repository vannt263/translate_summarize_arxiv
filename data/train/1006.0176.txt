    "peristaltic transport is well known to physiologists as a natural mechanism of pumping materials in the case of most physiological fluids .",
    "apart from physiological fluids , some other fluids also exhibit peristaltic behaviour .",
    "peristalsis usually occurs when the flow is induced by a progressive wave of area contraction / expansion along the length of the boundary of a fluid - filled distensible tube . usefulness of studies on peristaltic flow has been discussed in detail in our earlier publications ( misra et al .",
    "@xcite , maiti and misra @xcite ) and in some other references @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the phenomenon of peristalsis plays an important role in the functioning of heart - lung machine , blood pump machine and dialysis machine . fung and yih @xcite presented a theoretical analysis of peristaltic transport primarily with inertia - free newtonian flows driven by sinusoidal transverse waves of small amplitude .",
    "investigation of peristaltic motion in connection with functions of different physiological systems such as the ureter , the gastro - intestinal tract , the small blood vessels and other glandular ducts was first made by shapiro et al .",
    "they presented a closed form solution for an infinite train of waves for small reynolds number flow .",
    "their study was , however , restricted to cases where the wave length is long and the wave amplitude is arbitrary .",
    "conditions for the the presence of physiologically significant phenomena of trapping and reflux were also suggested by them .",
    "jaffrin and shapiro @xcite as well as srivastava and srivastava @xcite summarized the early literatures on peristaltic transport .",
    "some of the recent studies on peristaltic transport were discussed by usha and rao @xcite , mishra and rao @xcite , yaniv et al .",

    "some important theoretical analyses on different aspects of blood flow were carried out in a systematic manner by misra et al .",
    "attempt to consider the complex rheology of various physiological fluids was made in several studies @xcite .",
    "the non - newtonian behaviour of blood mainly owes to the presence of erythrocytes in whole blood . in the case of blood ,",
    "such behaviour starts becoming prominent when the hematocrit rises above 20@xmath0 .",
    "this particular behaviour plays a dominating role when the hematocrit level lies between 40@xmath0 and 70@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "some other relevant theoretical studies on non - newtonian fluid flows were carried out by masud and kwack @xcite , kwack and masud @xcite as well as by anand and rajagopal @xcite .",
    "it is known that the flow behaviour of blood in small vessels ( diameter@xmath10.02 cm ) and at low shear rate ( @xmath2 ) can be represented by a power law fluid @xcite .",
    "merill et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that casson model holds satisfactory for blood flowing in tubes of 130 - 1000@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , blair and spanner @xcite reported that blood obeys casson model for moderate shear rate flows .",
    "however , they pointed out that for cow s blood , herschel - bulkley model is more appropriate than casson model .",
    "it is known that physiological organs are by and large non - uniform ducts @xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite made some initial attempts to perform theoretical studies pertaining to peristaltic transport of physiological fluids in vessels of non - uniform cross section .",
    "these analyses were mostly restricted to the assumption of either a newtonian fluid or a non - newtonian fluid of casson / power - law type . moreover , in these reports the different flow characteristics have not been adequately discussed .",
    "the strong merit of herschel - bulkley model is that fluids represented by this model describe very well material flows with a non - linear constitutive relation depicting the behaviour of shear - thinning / shear - thickening fluids that are of much importance in the field of biomedical engineering @xcite .",
    "it is also to be noted that for formulating a non - newtonian model of blood , herschel - bulkley fluid model is more general than most other non - newtonian fluid models .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that results for a fluid represented by bingham plastic model , power law model and newtonian fluid model can be derived from those of the herschel - bulkley fluid model .",
    "also this model has been found to yield more accurate results than many other non - newtonian models .    in view of the above ,",
    "we have taken up here a study on the peristaltic transport of blood in a non - uniform channel , by treating blood as a herschel - bulkley fluid .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that flow through axisymmetric tubes is qualitatively similar to the case of flow in channels .",
    "on the basis of their theoretical / experimental study on peristaltic pumping at low reynolds number , shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite also confirmed that flow behaviour in the case of an axisymmetric tube is identical to that in the case of channel flow .",
    "the formulation and analysis presented in the sequel are particularly suitable for investigating the peristaltic motion in vessels of small dimensions , e.g. arterioles and venules .",
    "since for flow of blood through smaller vessels in the micro - circulatory system , the reynolds number is low and since the ratio between half - width of the channel under consideration and the wave length is considered small , it has been possible to perform the theoretical analysis for the present problem in a convenient manner , by using the lubrication theory @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the derived analytical expressions , computational work has been executed keeping a specific situation of micro - circulation in view , with the main purpose of examining the distribution of velocity of blood and wall shear stress as well as the streamline pattern , trajectories of individual fluid particles and pumping performance .",
    "the plots for the computed results give us a clear idea of qualitative variation of various fluid dynamical parameters .",
    "the results indicate plug flow in the central region , where most of the erythrocytes are accumulated and non - plug flow in the peripheral region .",
    "the results of the present study are in good agreement with those reported earlier by previous investigators .",
    "the study bears the potential to explore some important phenomena that are useful for having a better insight into the flow in the micro - circulatory system .",
    "the study has an important bearing on the clinical procedure of extra - corporeal circulation of blood by using the heart - lung machine , where there is a chance of damage of erythrocytes owing to significant variation of the wall shear stress .",
    "the results are also likely to find important application in roller pumps and arthro - pumps by which fluids can be transported in living organs in pathological states .",
    "let us consider the peristaltic motion of blood , by treating it as an incompressible viscous non - newtonian fluid .",
    "the non - newtonian behaviour is considered to be of herschel - bulkley type .",
    "we shall study two - dimensional channel flow , width of the channel being non - uniform .",

    "it may be noted that if we put @xmath71 in equations ( [ jam_axial_velocity ] ) , ( [ jam_stream_function_main ] ) , ( [ jam_volume_flow_rate ] ) and ( [ jam_pressure_gradient ] ) , the expressions reduce to those reported earlier in @xcite",
    ". our results also tally with those of @xcite , when the eccentricity of the elliptical motion of cilia tips is set equal to zero in their analysis for a newtonian fluid flowing through a uniform channel .",
    "moreover , when @xmath72 , the expression for the pressure gradient given by ( [ jam_pressure_gradient ] ) reduces to that obtained by gupta and seshadri @xcite for the peristaltic motion of a newtonian fluid having constant viscosity . it may be noted that since the right hand side of equation ( [ jam_pressure_rise ] ) can not integrated in closed form , for non - uniform / uniform geometry , for further investigation of our problem , we had to resort to the use of appropriate softwares , as mentioned in the next section .",
    "the instantaneous rate of volume flow @xmath73 has been assumed to be periodic in ( x - t ) ( @xcite ) , so that @xmath74 appearing equation ( [ jam_pressure_rise ] ) can be expressed as @xmath75 @xmath76 being the time - averaged flow flux . due to complexity of the problem , it has not been possible to find the expression for the average pressure rise , @xmath77 given by ( [ jam_pressure_gradient ] ) .",
    "it has been computed numerically by using the software mathematica .    in this section , on the basis of the present study",

    "[ jam_velo4.1 ] ) it is clear that at a given cross - section , flow of blood takes place alternately in / opposite to the direction of wave propagation in different phases .",
    "the functioning of arterioles may then be affected by the confluence of the convective transport in the longitudinal direction . by investigating the pathlines of massless particles moving in the direction opposite to that of the peristaltic wave propagation in the lagrangian frame of reference , it is possible to have an insight into the reflux phenomenon .    by resorting to appropriate numerical methods for solving the simultaneous differential equations @xmath131 successively starting from the initial location of the particles , it has been possible to determine the trajectories of the particles . in the above equations , ( x , y ) are the non - dimensional coordinates of a particle at time t.    one of the novel features of this study is the examination of the particle trajectories for a non - newtonian fluid . to the best of our knowledge and observation ,",
    "no previous investigator has ever studied the trajectories for a non - newtonian fluid .",
    "it is very important to observe that the convergence of the pathlines is very sensitive even to a moderate deviation from n=1 .",
    "integration of the above - written differential equations has been carried out by applying the runge - kutta @xmath132 method",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](a - b ) present the trajectories for the newtonian case , while figs .",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](c - d ) show the trajectories for the non - newtonian case .",
    "the trajectories displayed in fig .",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](a ) are exactly similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that the period of the particle is different from the wave period and that when @xmath88 , particles in the vicinity of the axis of the channel in most cases undergo a net positive displacement , whereas displacement of particles in the neighbourhood of the boundary is negative .",
    "these observations tally with those reported in @xcite .",
    "however , at the point ( 0.75,0.2 ) where the velocity profile of the particle at x=0.75 and time t=0.0 is minimum , the particle experiences a negative axial displacement ( cf . fig .",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](b ) ) .",
    "previous authors ( @xcite ) also reported that even for reynolds number 10 , at certain points near the axis , the longitudinal displacement of the fluid particle can be negative .",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](c ) shows that the particle period is nearly equal to the peristaltic wave period for a shear thinning fluid with @xmath133 . a comparison of fig .",

    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](c ) and fig .",
    "[ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](b ) reveals that within one wave period , in the case of a shear thickening fluid , a fluid particle traverses more distance than in the case of a shear thinning / newtonian fluid .",
    "the last paragaph of sec . 2 serves a validation of the analytical expressions derived in the present analysis . in order to validate the numerical results of the present study , we have compared our numerical results with those reported earlier by takabatake and ayukawa @xcite on the basis of their numerical study of two - dimensional peristaltic flows . the comparison given in fig .",
    "[ jam_pump4.1.2.1 - 4.3.2.4](a ) shows that our results are in good agreement with those given in @xcite .",

    "[ jam_velocompare](b , c ) for the axial velocity of blood in peristaltic movement match well with the corresponding results reported in @xcite . also , a comparison between figs .",
    "[ jam_velocon4.1.1 - 4.1.4](b ) and [ jam_velocon4.1.1 - 4.1.4](e ) shows that our results for the velocity contour are similar to those presented earlier by selvarajan et al .",
    "moreover , as shown in figs .",
    "[ jam_velocompare](a ) the axial velocity variation in our case is in perfect matching with that reported by shapiro et al .",
    "lastly , our results presented in fig . [ jam_traj4.1.1 - 4.1.4](a ) are in excellent agreement with those reported in @xcite .",
    "in this study , an attempt has been made to investigate the peristaltic motion of blood in the micro - circulatory system , by taking into account the non - uniform geometry of the arterioles and venules . treating blood as a herschel - bulkley fluid , the effect of amplitude ratio , mean pressure gradient , yield stress and the rheological fluid index n on distribution of the velocity and wall shear stress , pumping phenomena , streamline patterns and pathlines are examined under the purview of the lubrication theory .",
    "the salient observations are as follows :          \\(iv ) in case of a shear thinning fluid , flow reversal does not occur in the case of a channel having uniform geometry ; it transforms to forward flow in the case of a diverging channel . for a shear thickening fluid , flow reversal reduces , but it does not vanish altogether when @xmath146 changes from 0 to @xmath147 .",
    "the study bears the potential of significant application to the field of biomedical engineering and technology , because it is known that in roller pumps , the fluid elements are quite prone to significant damage of fluid elements ; also , in the process of transportation of fluids in living organisms , by using arthro - pumps , the fluid particles are likely to be appreciably damaged .",
    "moreover , the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the present investigation for the wall shear stress have a significant bearing on extra - corporeal circulation , where the heart - lung machine is usually used . in this case",
    ", there is a possibility that the erythrocytes of blood may get damaged .",
