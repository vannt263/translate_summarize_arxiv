    "in the beginning of 2012 i ve start the spreading of several ideas for the construction of a new theory of everything which could be called _ arrangement field theory_. unfortunately , academic world have ignored all such ideas both because the author is not affiliated to any university and because _ arrangement field theory _ ( from now _ aft _ ) is in slight contrast with _ string theory _ and _ loop quantum gravity_.    for example _ aft _ is not constructed in a space - time with a preset number of dimensions .",
    "dimensionality here is a free parameter whose most probable value is determined by theory itself .",
    "the theory considers in fact space - time as an abstract ensemble of atoms  , intended here as the smallest components ( of minimal iper - volume ) in which the space - time can be fragmented . in a similar way _",
    "aft _ predicts the number of families ( flavours ) of fermionic fields compatible with a given dimensionality ( for @xmath0 it gives @xmath1 or @xmath2 families ) .",
    "see section [ dimensions ] .",
    "the fundamental function of theory defines , for any couple of atoms  , the probability for finding them one beside the other .",
    "see section [ preliminary ] .",
    "the shape of universe and the localization of its components assume then a dynamical character , oscillating freely around a middle  configuration which is the one perceived in daily life . in this framework ,",
    "the quantum entanglement phenomenon between two particles is explained as the annulment of distance between the two particles when this is measured along an extra dimension which does nt appear in the middle configuration .",
    "see section [ entanglement ] .",
    "the phenomenon becomes then the quantum version of wormhole , where every particle assumes characters of a microscopic black hole .    in the continuous limit ,",
    "_ aft _ includes most features of great unification theories based upon gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "see sections [ gauge ] and [ representation ] .",
    "however it doest throw away _ string theory _ at all . in the first of my papers @xcite ,",
    "although pleonastic because of new concepts exposed here ( sections [ preliminary ] , [ curves ] , [ congruences ] ) , it preserves anyway a good section focused on a plausible triality between _ aft , string theory _ and _ loop quantum gravity_.",
    "we start by giving the eight pillars of * * a**rrangement * * f**ield * * t**heory :    * we define the physical space @xmath4 ( possibly a space - time ) as an abstract ensemble of space atoms  labeled with latin letters , i.e. @xmath5 with @xmath6 atoms of space ; * @xmath4 is a topological space with discrete topology ; * for every couple @xmath7 we associate an element @xmath8 in some @xmath9-algebra @xmath10 ; * an associated graph @xmath11 is an oriented abstract graph whose nodes are in one to one with space atoms @xmath6 and any arrow which goes from node @xmath12 to node @xmath13 is labeled by the corresponding @xmath8 ; +    * a non drawn arrow between @xmath12 and @xmath13 would correspond to @xmath14 ; * we define a norm for the associated graph @xmath11 as @xmath15 ; * @xmath16 is understood as the probability amplitude for the atom @xmath12 to be next to ( or to be connected with ) the atom @xmath13 ; * note that atom @xmath12 can be connected to atom @xmath13 without @xmath13 is connected to @xmath12",

    "the introduction of fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 is nothing but a free and useful choice for parameterizing @xmath21 $ ] . for their role in the following we call @xmath26 vielbein field  and @xmath27 gauge - gravitational field  .",
    "we ll see that internal indices of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( i.e. indices in the tangent space ) will appear as internal indices of @xmath10 generators .",
    "we conclude by exhibiting the continuous limit of @xmath21+\\na[\\bar{\\g}]$ ] .",
    "let start by consider a field @xmath30 defined at @xmath31 regular intervals separated by length @xmath32 along a straight line or a circle ( where the last and the first point of evaluation coincide ) .",

    "finally , if we consider the groups @xmath90 as the real physical points ( or events ) we can speak about a local @xmath98 , clearly referring local  to groups and not to the single atoms .    in this way , for every group @xmath95 we can write @xmath99 as @xmath100 and @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
