    "quantum computers ( qc ) are of great interest last years @xcite .",
    "numerous proposals have been made on the practical realization of qc based on the nmr in complex molecules , cold ions in electrostatic traps , qed systems with high - q cavities , and cold atoms trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the molecules , ions , and qed systems are well suited for modeling experiments demonstrating simple quantum operations on several qubits , but are difficult to scale to larger number of qubits required for a realistic qc @xcite .",
    "more promising experiments could be made with the cold trapped neutral atoms having advantages of low decoherence rate , scalability to large number of qubits , and ability to control their states by individual addressing of resonant optical pulses .",
    "atoms in optical lattices are usually trapped in two or three dimensions at the antinodes of the standing light waves @xcite . in other schemes",
    "implemented recently , atoms were trapped in the focuses of a two - dimensional array of microlenses spaced by 125 @xmath3 m @xcite , or in the focuses of two laser beams spaced by a few micrometers @xcite .",
    "ideally , each antinode should contain a single trapped atom representing a single qubit .",
    "deterministic loading of single atoms into the focus is a delicate problem that was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next stage is the operation on single or two qubits .",
    "quantum computation can be performed using a sequence of single - qubit ( not ) and two - qubit ( controlled - not , or cnot ) operations in an ensemble of qubits @xcite . in the case of alkali atoms ,",
    "a two - level qubit is represented by two hyperfine sublevels of a ground s state",
    ". the not operator is implemented by raman transitions between the sublevels , induced by a two - frequency laser pulse that inverts quantum state of qubit .",
    "the cnot operator is much more difficult to realize , since it corresponds to a quantum nondemolition measurement of one ( `` control '' ) qubit interacting with another ( `` target '' ) qubit , and after its action the two qubits should be in an entangled state .",
    "the main experimental problem is thus to make entangled any of two atoms in the lattice , or at least any of two neighboring atoms .",
    "recently , the dipole - dipole interaction was proposed for use to entangle neutral alkali atoms in lattices or in cold atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "this interaction , however , is weak for the ground - state or low - excited atoms . in order to make the interaction stronger ,",
    "it was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite to excite atoms for a while into the _ nl _ rydberg states with _ _",
    "n@xmath4__1 , and after some manipulations bring them back to ground state .",
    "large atomic sizes ( growing as _ _",
    "n__@xmath5 ) and correspondingly large dipole moments of rydberg atoms @xcite strongly enhance the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this interaction changes the energies of rydberg states , and may be viewed as a stark shift in an atom placed in the dipole electric fields of other atoms .",
    "the energy of this atom thus depends on the states of neighboring atoms ( whether they are in a rydberg or in a ground state ) .",
    "entangled states may be generated using a sequence of optical pulses applied to chosen qubits @xcite or using dipole - induced changes in the spectra of collective excitations in the ensemble of rydberg atoms ( `` dipole blockade '' ) @xcite .",
    "similar considerations were also made for the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction between rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "however , this interaction could be strong only for high rydberg states and short interatomic distances comparable with the size of rydberg atoms . in comparison with dipole - dipole interaction ,",
    "it is advantageous due to independence of the orientation of dipoles , but seems to be impractical from its weakness",
    ". nevertheless , experimental studies of the vdw interaction are of interest since it may affect the laser excitation of rydberg states .",
    "the first experimental observation of vdw for rydberg atoms in a dense atomic beam was reported in @xcite , and some experimental indications of the local vdw blockade in the ensemble of cold rydberg atoms were reported recently @xcite .    shifts and broadenings due to dipole - dipole interactions in large ensembles of cold rydberg atoms in magneto - optical traps were observed for the stark resonances in resonant collisions @xcite , and recently for the microwave transitions between rydberg states @xcite . however , experimental observation of dipole - induced frequency shifts of transitions for two rydberg atoms or dipole blockade for a small ensemble have not been reported yet .",
    "such experiments meet many technical difficulties , require a dense optical lattice with a detection system for rydberg atoms and powerful narrow - band lasers for fast excitation of rydberg states from the ground state .",
    "on the other hand , some modeling experiments with low number of atoms may be performed in an atomic beam with microwave transitions between neighboring rydberg states .",
    "such experiments can reveal important features of the multi - particle excitation spectra of rydberg atoms .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the applicability of rydberg atoms to qc from a practical point of view , and analyze conditions required to implement proposed schemes in practice .",
    "we also present the results of modeling experiments on the microwave spectroscopy of multi - atom excitations of sodium rydberg atoms .",
    "the dipole moment of an atom is proportional to the average radius _",
    "r _ of the electron orbit .",
    "we have to choose _ r _ as large as possible in order to use advantages of rydberg atoms . in a hydrogen atom ,",
    "_ r _ is given by the formula @xcite    @xmath6    where _",
    "_ a__@xmath7 is the bohr radius . _",
    "r _ has close value also for the rydberg states of hydrogen - like alkali atoms . a short distance",
    "_ r _ between neighboring atoms in the lattice imposes obvious limitation on the maximal value of _ r _ : _ r _ must exceed _ r _ by an order of magnitude to avoid collisions between electrons of close rydberg atoms .",
    "collisions have large cross - sections ( comparable with atomic size ) , and may cause fast decoherence of rydberg states ( e.g. , mixing of degenerate magnetic sublevels or stochastic jumps in the phases of wave - functions ) . assuming _",
    "_ r__@xmath8_r_/10 , the maximum principal quantum number _ _ n__@xmath9 of rydberg atoms in the lattice is thus limited by    @xmath10    in the optical lattices of alkali atoms , _ r _ can vary from @xmath110.5 @xmath3 m ( in red - detuned dipole traps ) to @xmath115 @xmath12 m ( in quasi - electrostatic traps with a co@xmath13-laser ) @xcite , or to 125 @xmath3 m for microlenses array @xcite .",
    "the spacing 0.5 @xmath3 m is too small for reliable individual optical access to each qubit without disturbing the neighboring qubits , while 125 @xmath3 m is too long for effective dipole - dipole interaction ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "the 5 @xmath14 m value seems to be optimal for both of optical access and compatibility with co@xmath13-laser traps having an advantage of extremely low scattering rate of photons .    from eq.([eq2 ] ) for s - states ( _ _ l__=0 ) one obtains _ _ n__@xmath1570 at _ _",

    "r__@xmath115 @xmath3 m .",
    "excitation of circular states , however , requires much time and sophisticated combination of the optical and microwave pulses in the magnetic and electric fields .",
    "one can conclude that in practice low-_l _ states with @xmath1770 should be chosen , although higher _",
    "n _ would result in a stronger dipole interaction , and experiments with _ _ n__@xmath11500 have been already reported @xcite .    for further considerations we take _",
    "_ n@xmath8__70 and _ _",
    "r@xmath18__5 @xmath3 m as preliminary parameters satisfying the following experimental conditions : ( i ) _ _ r__@xmath195 @xmath12 m is a spacing that provides free optical access to each qubit and compatibility with co@xmath13-laser lattices ; ( ii ) _ _ n@xmath18__70 is a maximal principal quantum number at given _",
    "r _ that ensures absence of collisions between neighboring rydberg atoms .",
    "now we have to analyze the dipole - dipole interaction at the _ n _ and _ r _ values specified above .",
    "consider the interaction between two identical rydberg atoms _ a _ and _ b _ spaced by a distance _ r _ ( fig.1 ) .",
    "these two atoms may be viewed as a quasi - molecule whose energy eigenstates should be determined in a molecular wavefunctions basis @xmath20 , as it was made in refs .",
    "@xcite . for example , if we choose for the consideration two close nondegenerate rydberg states of opposite parity , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , molecular states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are degenerate in energy and experience strong dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the eigenstates of the quasi - molecule are readily found by solving the secular equation with the interaction hamiltonian    @xmath25,\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dipole moment operators of atoms _ a _ and _ b _ , @xmath28 is a vector connecting two atoms , and @xmath29 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the solution shows that degenerate states of the quasi - molecule are split by the dipole - dipole interaction to two sublevels with symmetric ( superradiant ) and antisymmetric ( subradiant ) wave functions    @xmath30    a model for the dipole - dipole interaction between two rydberg atoms .",
    "states @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two neighboring rydberg levels .",
    "states @xmath33 are eigenstates of a composite system of two interacting atoms . ]",
    "if the quantization axis _ z _ is chosen along @xmath28 , and states @xmath34 and @xmath22 have identical momentum projections that are bound only by the @xmath35 components of dipole operators ( e.g. , particular zeeman sublevels of states @xmath34 and @xmath36 whose degeneracy is lifted by a magnetic field ) , the energy shifts of these states are    @xmath37    where _ _ d__@xmath38 is _ z _ component of the dipole matrix element of the 1@xmath392 transition .    addressing short individual laser pulses to the atoms",
    ", we can initially excite atom _ a _ into state @xmath21 and atom _ b",
    "_ into state @xmath36 .",
    "then atoms start to interact , and the time evolution of the wavefunction of the quasimolecule is following :    @xmath40    i.e. , population oscillates between states @xmath41 and @xmath24 with a frequency @xmath42 .    this process may be considered as an exchange of virtual photons between two atoms .",
    "it was already observed experimentally when two rb atoms in circular rydberg states with _",
    "_ n__=50 and 51 were passed through a high - q superconducting microwave cavity with variable detuning from resonance transition between these states @xcite .",
    "the cavity strongly enhanced the interaction so that photon exchange occurred at _ _",
    "r__@xmath111 mm on a time scale of @xmath11100 @xmath3s .",
    "huge gain of the dipole - dipole interaction makes high - q cavities attractive for modeling experiments on qc employing atoms passed through the cavity .",
    "however , in more realistic qc with cold trapped atoms it would complicate the loading of the lattice and optical access to atoms , and require special arrangement for cavity cooling to the temperatures @xmath431 k. cooling is needed to achieve the superconductivity and , what is more important , to suppress the photons of blackbody radiation ( bbr ) that induce uncontrolled transitions between rydberg states @xcite .",
    "the cavity significantly increases rates of bbr - transitions , as we have demonstrated in @xcite , although usage of detuned cavity in @xcite made atoms less sensitive to bbr .",
    "further we will analyze the interaction in a free space , since practical application of a cavity for enhancement of dipole - dipole interaction is ambiguous .    from eq.([eq6 ] ) one finds that in a free space the population returns back to state @xmath23 after the time    @xmath44    while the wavefunction changes its sign , or obtains a phase shift @xmath45 . such evolution is well suited for realization of a conditional quantum phase gate ( qpg ) proposed in @xcite and realized in a microwave cavity experiment with rb rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "qpg is of great importance since it may be consequently converted to cnot gate with additional rotation of one of qubits .",
    "qpg was also analyzed theoretically in @xcite for two rb rydberg atoms trapped in close laser focuses , as in experiment @xcite .",
    "a scheme was considered in which two atoms were initially excited to the same 42s rydberg state , lying almost in the middle between two neighboring states 41p and 42p .",
    "similar situation was also employed in proposals on the dipole blockade at multi - atom excitations in the atomic ensemble , but in this case an electric field was required to tune transitions to exact resonance @xcite .",
    "we propose another scheme that uses only two _ _ n__s and _ _ n__p rydberg states in two alkali atoms _ a _ and _ b _ ( fig.2 ) , and no stark tuning is needed .",
    "the ground s - state has two hyperfine sublevels f=1 and f=2 ( for example , in @xmath46na and @xmath47rb atoms ) which represent two qubit states @xmath48 and @xmath49 . atom _",
    "a _ is excited from state @xmath49 to _",
    "_ n__s rydberg state by a @xmath45/2 laser pulse via absorption of two photons , while atom _ b _ is excited from state @xmath49 to _ _ n__p rydberg state by a @xmath50/2 laser pulse via one - photon absorption .",
    "[ expressions describing @xmath45/2 pulses for the one- and two - photon transitions will be given below in eqs.([eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq12 ] ) , and ( [ eq13 ] ) ] .",
    "atoms are returned back to the ground state by the subsequent 3@xmath45/2 laser pulses .",
    "the final phase of the composite wavefunction changes by @xmath45 if the dipole - dipole interaction occurs between exciting and de - exciting laser pulses during time _ t _ of eq.([eq7 ] ) . in any other cases of initial states of qubits",
    "there will be no phase shifts , as is required for qpg .",
    "the laser pulses should be strong and short enough to make excitation and de - excitation insensitive to dipole - induced energy shifts .",
    "eq.([eq7 ] ) determines minimum time of qpg .",

    "after dipole - dipole interaction they are returned back to the ground state by 3@xmath45/2 laser pulses . ]    we can also analyze an opportunity to observe the frequency shifts of microwave transitions between rydberg states for modeling the dipole blockade effect @xcite .",
    "for instance , we may apply a microwave radiation to both atoms initially excited to _ _ n__s state . recording the absorption spectrum",
    ", we should see a shift in the frequency of single - atom excitation of two atoms at the transition @xmath52 , in comparison with unperturbed frequency of the _",
    "_ n__s@xmath39__n__p transition in a single rydberg atom .",
    "the frequency of the transition @xmath53 is also shifted , but probability of this transition is zero due to antisymmetric wave function of @xmath54 state",
    ".    dipole - dipole interaction thus affects the frequencies of transitions in an atomic ensemble .",
    "if we apply a pulse of microwave radiation at the unperturbed frequency of the _ _ n__s@xmath39__n__p transition , and the shift is large enough , the final state of rydberg atom will depend on whether the neighboring atoms are in rydberg or in ground states .",
    "a necessary condition is that the frequency shift @xmath55 must exceed spectral width of the pulsed radiation that is ultimately limited by its duration @xmath56 :    @xmath57    fast qc requires _",
    "t _ from eq.([eq7 ] ) or @xmath56 from eq.([eq8 ] ) to be as short as possible .",
    "eq.([eq7 ] ) is more appropriate to satisfy this requirement , and we see that the qpg gate needs much smaller _ _ v__@xmath58 . in order to find _ t _ from eq.([eq7 ] ) , we estimate achievable values of _ _",

    "the radial part _ d _ of dipole moments of transitions ( _ _ nl@xmath39nl@xmath59__1 ) between close rydberg states is roughly estimated as    @xmath60    where _ e _ is the electron charge .",

    "t__@xmath1150 ns . we see that in principle the qpg operation based on dipole - dipole interaction of rydberg atoms can be rather fast .",
    "however , as we will see below , achievable speed of laser excitation of rydberg states imposes serious practical limitations .",
    "laser pulses exciting and de - exciting rydberg states must be much shorter than _ t _ to provide sharp switching and ensure the validity of eq.([eq6 ] ) . at _ _",
    "t__@xmath1150 ns the pulses should be of @xmath661 - 5 ns duration .",
    "the use of short pulses encounters two serious obstacles .",
    "first , the probabilities of single - photon transitions from low - excited to rydberg states fall as _ _",
    "n__@xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this is a forcible argument not to use very high rydberg states : short laser pulses would require too high laser power to generate , e.g. , 3@xmath45/2 pulses for the de - excitation of rydberg states to ground states . for example , the calculated laser intensity required for a 3@xmath45/2 pulse of 5 ns duration is 120 mw / cm@xmath5 for the ( 3s@xmath0 f=2 m@xmath69=2)@xmath70(50p@xmath71 f=3 m@xmath69=3 ) transition at 240 nm in na , and 30 mw / cm@xmath5 for the ( 5s@xmath0 f=2 m@xmath69=2)@xmath70(50p@xmath71 f=3 m@xmath69=3 ) transition at 300 nm in rb .",
    "even if laser radiation is focused to a spot of @xmath111 @xmath12 m size , the laser powers should be @xmath111 w for na and @xmath430.25 w for rb .",
    "also important is that each atom in the lattice should be controlled by its own laser beam , so the total laser power required for the lattice , say , of 100 atoms would be extremely large .",
    "for uv radiation at 250 - 300 nm such powers are difficult to obtain from frequency doubled or tripled cw lasers with external modulators . at the same time",
    ", powerful pulsed lasers can not provide the frequency and amplitude stability required for reliable and reproducible quantum operations .",
    "second , 5 ns pulses have @xmath11200 mhz spectral width that is not enough for spectral resolution of transitions between particular sublevels of the ground and rydberg states .",
    "for example , the calculated fine structure intervals of the 50p state are 45 mhz in na and 819 mhz in rb .",
    "the resolution of @xmath1120 mhz is thus required for excitation of particular sublevels of rydberg states .",
    "both of obstacles specified above may be overcome simply by increasing the duration of laser pulses to @xmath1150 ns .",
    "however , since time _",
    "t _ of dipole - dipole interaction defined by eq.([eq7 ] ) should be an order of magnitude longer than laser pulses , _",
    "t _ has to be increased to @xmath11500 ns by lowering @xmath72 to @xmath111 mhz .",
    "the decrease may be achieved by lowering @xmath73 value to @xmath7430 .",
    "laser power per atom decreases to reasonable values of @xmath112 mw for na and @xmath110.5 mw for rb , and spectral resolution will be improved to @xmath1120 mhz .    in general , rydberg states with _",
    "_ n__=25 - 50 in na and rb atoms may be excited from the ground states by single- or multi - photon absorption .",
    "a single - photon process requires uv laser radiation and allows the excitation of _ _ n__p - states only ( in the presence of electric field , however , other states may be excited due to the mixing of the zero - field wavefunctions ) . for rb atoms , uv radiation at 300 nm",
    "is required , that may be obtained by doubling the frequency of a rhodamine 6 g dye - laser at 600 nm . on the other hand ,",
    "intense 600 nm radiation itself can excite the _",
    "_ n__s and _ _ n__d rydberg states of rb via two - photon absorption .",
    "the scheme of fig.2 thus may be realized with two rhodamine 6 g dye - lasers .",
    "these lasers , however , need powerful pumping lasers ( ar or second harmonic of nd : yag ) . for compact inexpensive rb experimental setups",

    "the 410 nm dye - laser can be replaced with a second harmonic of cw ti : sapphire laser or blue semiconductor diode laser .    finally , taking into account limited speed of laser excitation",
    ", we have to specify new optimal parameters for quantum operations : the laser pulses of @xmath1150 ns duration should be used to excite and de - excite rydberg atoms at reasonable laser powers ; the time of qpg operation should be increased to @xmath11500 ns by decreasing the principal quantum number to _ _ n@xmath76__30 .",
    "we note that model of fig.2 does not take into account the degeneracy of atomic states .",
    "it is important both for the laser excitation and dipole - dipole interaction , since dipole moments of transitions between various magnetic sublevels of degenerate states differ by magnitudes and signs .",
    "obviously , the ground - state atoms in the optical lattice must be optically pumped to a single magnetic sublevel prior quantum operations .",
    "otherwise , if the ground states are arbitrary mixtures of magnetic sublevels , the speed of laser excitation to rydberg states will be different for various particular transitions , and @xmath77 laser pulses can not be obtained to transfer all populations to rydberg states .",
    "accounting for the magnetic sublevels at the dipole - dipole interaction results in several different energy levels of the quasi - molecule of two rydberg atoms .",

    "the behaviour of the quasi - molecule depends now on initial distribution of populations over magnetic sublevels of rydberg states .",
    "calculations have revealed that eq.([eq6 ] ) is no more valid , and the phase shift @xmath80 of the wavefunction can not be achieved for degenerate sublevels .",
    "we conclude that degeneracy should be completely lifted for both ground and rydberg states , e.g. , by a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the field should be strong enough to split the sublevels by a value exceeding the expected energy of dipole - dipole interaction @xmath811 mhz in order to ensure validity of eq.([eq6 ] ) .      _ magnetic field",
    "_ splits degenerate sublevels due to the zeeman effect .",
    "the zeeman effect in rydberg atoms and quantum interference of degenerate sublevels at microwave transitions in a weak magnetic field were studied experimentally in our work @xcite .",
    "the splittings are approximately 2.8 mhz / gs for @xmath73s@xmath0 states and 0.93 mhz / gs for @xmath73p@xmath0 states .",
    "one finds that @xmath8210 gs field is required to split the @xmath73p@xmath0 state by 10 mhz .",
    "applied magnetic field will also reduce the sensitivity of atoms to stray magnetic fields .",
    "for example , the earth s magnetic field of the 0.5 gs magnitude alone splits atomic states by @xmath110.5 mhz .",
    "this results in a phase difference of the order of @xmath45 obtained by magnetic sublevels during @xmath111 @xmath3s interaction time , and in a mixing of populations due to the precession of magnetic moment .",
    "the phase is important when optical or microwave transitions are excited between coherently prepared degenerate states that can interfere .",
    "our previous experiment on microwave hanle effect at the 37p@xmath8337s@xmath0 microwave transition in na atoms demonstrated variation of the probability by 50% when magnetic field was varied within 20 mgs around zero @xcite . in another experiment with this transition we observed a mixing of populations due to the precession @xcite .",
    "application of a magnetic field of @xmath8210 gs will define the quantization axis and suppress the precessions from stray fields , so that no additional magnetic screening will be needed .",

    "usage of s and p states has an advantage of ability to use stark - switching technique to control the interaction with cw radiation in a coherent way , as it was demonstrated in our recent experiment on stark - switched ramsey interferometry of the 37s@xmath7837p@xmath0 transition @xcite .",
    "the stark - switching can significantly simplify experiments because it eliminates the need to use fast modulators for cw radiation , but it would require phase corrections of quantum operations to account for additional phase shifts from the stark effect .",
    "lower rydberg states with @xmath8530 are less sensitive to the electric field than states in fig.3 since polarizabilities scale as @xmath86 , and no electric field screening will be required if 30s and 30p states will be used .",

    "first , atoms in the atomic beam have a maxwell velocity distribution with average velocity 600 m / s .",
    "this value corresponds to 150 khz doppler broadening of the one - photon microwave transitions at 70 ghz .",
    "the broadening is less important for two - photon transitions , since photons in the standing wave may be absorbed from two traveling waves propagating in opposite direction , and the doppler effect is partly compensated for .",
    "more important is that effective time of interaction depends on the atom velocity since atoms are passed through the nodes and antinodes of the standing wave , so that maxima and minima in the spectra may wash out .",
    "second , the spectra in fig.6 were recorded in identical experimental conditions except the difference in the microwave intensity .",
    "we believe that better agreement with theory for the two - photon transition , and disagreement for the one - photon transition originate also from significant difference in the microwave photon density required for the not operation . according to eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , inversion is achieved with @xmath77 microwave pulses :    @xmath114    these relations allow the calculation of _ e _ value , provided relevant dipole moments are known .",
    "their radial parts were calculated numerically following to ref.@xcite , and found to be 1460 a.u . for the 37s@xmath3937p transition and 1430 a.u . for the 37p@xmath3938s transition .",
    "angular parts were taken for the transitions induced by linearly polarized microwave field , with the fine - structure taken into account .",
    "the average density of microwave photons at the antinode of a standing wave was estimated from the following energy relation : volume density of the energy of the electromagnetic field is    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is a dielectric constant . dividing this expression by @xmath117 , we obtain a volume density of photons _",
    "dn_/_dv _ about 50 cm@xmath67 for the one - photon 37s@xmath7837p@xmath0 transition , and about 10@xmath118 cm@xmath67 for the two - photon 37s@xmath7838s@xmath0 transition .",
    "extremely low number of photons at the one - photon transition requires huge attenuation of the output power of the microwave oscillator .",
    "even with such attenuation , we noticed that photons leaking the oscillator through its case penetrated into the interaction region through the holes in the detection system and interfered with photons coming from the waveguide .",
    "this interference caused instability in the spatial distribution of the microwave field and also resulted in fluctuations of effective interaction time .",
    "to some extent , this assumption was confirmed experimentally when we decreased the time of interaction to 0.3 @xmath3s , and increased the microwave intensity in the waveguide by three times . the one - photon resonance became wider , but in the center of the line we were able to transfer about 80% of population to the upper state , and better agreement of the spectrum with eq.([eq11 ] )",
    "was found .",
    "obviously , the doppler effect will be suppressed to a high degree in the case of cold atoms trapped in the optical lattices , but vibrational motion of atoms and fluctuations of laser intensity and frequency may affect the precision of not operations in a way similar to that in fig.6 .",
    "our detection system measured the total number of rydberg atoms and distribution of populations after each laser pulse .",
    "we accumulated multi - atom signals for a short time ( 1 - 2 s ) and automatically sorted them by number of detected atoms and by distribution of populations . no dipole - dipole interaction was observed in this experiment since average distance between rydberg atoms was @xmath11100 @xmath3 m .",
    "the experiments were made with of one - photon 37s@xmath7837p@xmath0 and two - photon 37s@xmath11938s@xmath0 transitions .",
    "we denote the initial 37s@xmath0 state to be state 1 , and the final states 37p@xmath0 or 38s@xmath0 to be state 2 .    in the simplest case of two - atom excitations ,",
    "an initial state is @xmath120 , while four final states of two atoms may be detected after interaction with the microwave field : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "direct products of single - atom wavefunctions describe these states if atoms do not interact with each other . the probabilities to find two atoms after a measurement in a particular state",
    "may be expressed as    @xmath124    for the one - photon transition , and    @xmath125    for the two - photon transition . here",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 are the probabilities to find single atom in a final state given by eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , and @xmath128=(1-@xmath126 ) or @xmath129=(1-@xmath127 ) are probabilities of the single atom to remain in the 37s state .",
    "in fig.7 we present the experimental records of the two - atom spectra ( three upper traces ) , and compare them with a single - atom spectrum ( lower trace ) .",
    "microwave intensity was adjusted to provide maximum population transfer to the upper state .",
    "the right - hand schemes show what final states of the composite system of two atoms were detected .",
    "the comparison of the spectra with calculations by eq.([eq16 ] ) revealed good agreement for the two - photon transition , confirming that we indeed detected only two atoms .",
    "agreement was much worse for the one - photon transition due to the reasons discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "all two - atom spectra are different from that of a single atom .",
    "we note two important features : ( i ) probability of excitation of only one of two atoms has a narrow dip in the line center due to large probability to excite both atoms , and ( ii ) probability of excitation of both atoms has narrower spectrum than single - atom spectrum .",
    "this may have applications for high - resolution spectroscopy as a method of narrowing of atomic lines .",
    "for example , in the case of _ n _ rydberg atoms the probability to transfer all atoms to the upper state 2 is    @xmath130    for the two - photon transition .",

    "n_. we conclude that ultimate resolution of this method of narrowing of atomic lines is limited by the ability to distinguish full excitation of the atomic ensemble from the partial one , and by the ability to transfer populations of all atoms to the upper states , otherwise amplitude of the multi - atom resonance would rapidly decrease with growing @xmath133 .",
    "although our experiments were made with atomic beam and no dipole - dipole interaction was observed , obtained spectra revealed the main features of single- and multi - atom excitations .",
    "we expect that similar spectra would be observed , e.g. , at the laser excitation of an ensemble of rydberg atoms from the ground state .",
