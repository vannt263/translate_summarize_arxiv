    "the atmospheres of giant gaseous planets and brown dwarfs ( objects with a mass below that required for stable nuclear fusion , mass @xmath17 jupiter masses ) are molecule - rich and chemically complex .",

    "all of these issues suggest that tuning the chemical mixing , or using a retrieval approach such as in line et al .",

    "1996 , burrows et al . 1997 ) . changing log @xmath53 by 0.5 dex changes the [ 4.5 ] flux by a factor @xmath121 , which is larger than or similar to the likely uncertainty in the model .",
    "however our experiments using the @xmath7 peaks together in a spectral by - eye comparison shows that gravity can be further constrained to 0.25 dex for these y dwarfs ( e.g. figure 7 ) .",
    "the fits , together with evolutionary models , then imply a mass of @xmath122 jupiter masses for both w0350 and w1738 . once the models are more robust , the @xmath8 and @xmath28 colors show promise for constraining log @xmath53 ( figures 5 and 6 ) , although metallicity variations will need to also be considered .",
    "given the range in colors seen for different gravities and different input physics ( s12 vs. t15 ) in figure 4 , the uncertainty in our derived temperature is @xmath123  k. current models show that a change in 25  k at these temperatures changes the flux in the @xmath9 band by a factor @xmath124 which is larger than the likely systematic error in the models and data , and we adopt an uncertainty in @xmath22 of @xmath125  k. this is supported by the range in parameters for the preferred and runner up models described in the previous section . note that exploration of a limited set of non - solar metallicity models in the previous section showed that a change in [ m / h ] of 0.2 dex changed the derived @xmath22 by 25  k , consistent with the adopted uncertainty ( figure 9 ) .",
