    "the problem of  commensurability \" in almost periodic systems has been a source of fascination in various branches of physics . in this respect ,",
    "the bloch states in periodic systems in strong magnetic fields have especially appealing .",
    "namely , the electron system with a periodic potential ( or a tight - binding electron system on a lattice ) in two spatial dimensions(2d ) exhibits , when a uniform magnetic field is applied , a self - similar energy spectrum , known as hofstadter s butterfly , with fractal wave functions@xcite . in this case , the problem is how the bloch electrons react to an external periodicity introduced by the magnetic field .",
    "this problem , raised more than twenty years ago by hofstadter , has been intensively investigated .",
    "the special assets of this problem are : ( i ) mathematically , schrdinger s equation reduces to harper s equation with doubly - periodic potential , where one periodicity is externally governed by the strength of the applied magnetic field , @xmath3 , so that the bloch states are controlled _ in situ _ by varying @xmath4 .",
    "\\(ii ) in hofstadter s butterfly ( the fractal energy spectrum versus @xmath4 ) , each landau band splits into fractal subbands , where the integer quantum hall effect(iqhe ) is known to occur .",
    "the general argument of laughlin @xcite tells us that each of the fractally split bands should carry a quantized hall current , while in usual cases each landau band does .",
    "et al_@xcite in fact have shown , by actually deriving the general formula for the quantized hall conductance in 2d periodic system without any special assumption on the periodic potential , that the quantum number characterizing the hall current carried by each subband is a topological invariant .",
    "now , for both of ( i ) and ( ii ) above , two dimensionality is essential , since , first , schrdinger s equation reduces to doubly - periodic equation only in 2d ( while we have a triply - periodic potential in 3d ) and , second , the quantum hall effect is usually considered to be specific to 2d . nevertheless , we want to ask ourselves here : can we have similar phenomena that survive , or even arise specifically , in three dimensions ( 3d ) ?",
    "in the last decade several authors have indeed attempted to extend hofstadter s problem to 3d systems@xcite .",
    "usually , however , subbands overlap in energy or touch with each other in 3d , and fractal energy spectra have not been identified . on the other hand ,",
    "halperin@xcite has shown , following the line of the analysis for 2d , that if the spectrum has an energy gap , iqhe should occur even in 3d .",
    "montambaux and kohmoto@xcite then proposed that 3d bloch system in magnetic fields can realize this situation to derive the formula for hall conductivities .",
    "these results are generalized by kohmoto , halperin and wu@xcite .    in our previous letter@xcite",
    ", we have shown that an analogue of hofstadter s butterfly does indeed arise in an anisotropic tight - binding lattice @xmath5 when a magnetic field is tilted , where the conductive axis is denoted as @xmath6 .",
    "we have calculated the hall conductivity and have shown that each of @xmath1 , identified to be topological invariants , exhibits an integer quantum hall effect , with a curious one - to - one correspondence with the qhe in 2d butterfly .",
    "this has been explained with a mapping between 2d and 3d .",
    "a crucial point is that the ` 3d butterfly ' is specific to three dimensionality rather than a remnant of the 2d butterfly .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address the following new points :    \\(a ) to obtain a ` phase diagram ' that indicates which region in @xmath7 space should exhibit the butterfly .",
    "\\(b ) to show that the 3d butterfly is general enough to allow arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "\\(c ) to clarify the relation with the semiclassical quantization picture in magnetic fields in discussing the details of the 2d-3d mapping .",
    "so the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[secphase ] , we review harper s equations for the 3d bloch electrons in magnetic fields , and introduce the phase diagram of 3d butterfly . in sec.[secbx ] , we extend the 2d-3d mapping to the arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field to discuss the influence of @xmath8 on the butterfly spectrum . in sec.[secsemicl ] , we compare our results with the semiclassical approximation . in sec.vi , we turn to qhe in the 3d butterfly , where the hall conductivity is calculated in a much simpler way than in our earlier paper .",
    "experimental possibilities to realize the 3d butterfly is discussed in sec.[sechall ] , and the conclusion is given in sec.[secconcl ] .",
    "let us first summarize the results obtained in our previous work,@xcite where we first suggested that we can have a butterfly spectrum in 3d systems . we take a noninteracting tight - binding electron system in a uniform magnetic field , @xmath3 .",
    "schrdinger s equation is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the wave function at site @xmath11 , the summation is over nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath12 the peierls phase factor arising from the magnetic flux where is the vector potential with @xmath13 .",
    "we consider a 3d simple - cubic lattice in a magnetic field @xmath14 assumed to be parallel to the @xmath15 plane .",
    "if we choose the vector potential as @xmath16 , we can substitute @xmath17 in eq.([harp ] ) with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the site indexes along @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath21 f_l = e f_l    \\label{harp3d}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 are the transfer integrals between nearest neighbors along @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath23 or @xmath24 are the numbers of flux quanta penetrating the facet of the unit cell normal to @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( fig.[geom ] ) .",
    "let us call two cosine potentials in ( [ harp3d ] ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we assume @xmath29 , the periods of these cosine potentials are much greater than the original lattice constant , so that the problem reduces to a continuous 1d system if we apply the effective - mass approach .",
    "one can then regard the potential minima of @xmath27 as effective ` sites ' , which we call the wells to distinguish from the original sites .",
    "each well feels the residual potential @xmath28 .",
    "if the well is deep enough , several bound states appear at each well , where each state forms a tight - binding band , which corresponds to a landau band .",
    "let us define @xmath30 as the hopping between adjacent wells , where @xmath31 gives the width ( harper s broadening ) of a landau level .",
    "then eq.([harp3d ] ) reads , in terms of the wells , @xmath32 j_{l ' } =    e j_{l'}\\label{harpeff},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the amplitude at the well @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that the equation has the same form as that of the 2d system ( eq.([harp3d ] ) with @xmath35 ) , which explains why a butterfly spectrum can appear also in 3d .",
    "if we recall that a 2d system exhibits a butterfly when isotropic ( @xmath36 ) , one can predict that the landau band for which @xmath37 should exhibit a butterfly structure , where the value of @xmath30 varies from one landau band to another .",
    "we have to satisfy some conditions on @xmath38 to have the 3d butterfly .",
    "by systematically examining them we can obtain the ` phase diagram ' , which was not obtained in our previous letter .",
    "we again assume @xmath39 , and we take @xmath40 as the unit of energy .",
    "let us begin with the pure 2d case ( @xmath41 ) , where we have only one potential term @xmath27 in harper s equation .",
    "if one approximates a well in @xmath27 as a harmonic potential , the energy is quantized into @xmath42 .",
    "the condition that there exist more than one levels bound to each well ( i.e. landau levels ) is then @xmath43 ( depth of the well ) , i.e. , @xmath44 if the opposite inequality holds , @xmath27 has only a weak effect on the energy spectrum and wave functions .",
    "if we turn @xmath45 on , each landau level feels the residual potential @xmath28 and can split into butterfly bands . for the butterfly gaps to be resolved ,",
    "however , @xmath28 must be weak enough so that it does not mix different landau levels .",
    "in other words , @xmath46 , the amplitude of @xmath28 , must be smaller than @xmath47 , or @xmath48    we can now construct the phase diagram .",
    "since an equivalent discussion can be made when we interchange @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we must add the conditions @xmath49 the resultant phase diagram is shown in fig.[phase ] .",
    "the phase diagram consists of 1d , 2d , 3d butterfly , and 3d regions .",
    " 1d \" is the region where neither eq.([cond1 ] ) nor eq.([cond3 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "there , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are too weak and the energy spectrum can only have bragg - reflection gaps .",
    "since this phase is dominated by @xmath50 , we call this 1d - like . an example , with a bragg gap , is depicted in fig.[1dlike ] .  2d - like \"",
    "is the region where only one of eq.([cond1 ] ) or eq.([cond3 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "there , one of @xmath51 or @xmath45 has only minor effect and the spectrum is 2d - like in that we have only ( harper - broadened ) landau levels .",
    "then we come to the ",
    "3d butterfly \" phases , where eqs.([cond1]),([cond2 ] ) ( or eqs.([cond3]),([cond4 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the remaining region is ",
    "3d \" , where all the three hoppings are too large for energy gaps to survive .",
    "namely , even when both eq.([cond1 ] ) and eq.([cond3 ] ) are satisfied , the butterfly gaps are wiped out when the other conditions are not satisfied , i.e. , when the residual potential is too large .",
    "so the 3d butterfly is allowed to appear somewhere in between the 2d and 3d phases .",
    "when the magnetic field is too small , two parabolic phase boundaries coalesce to the axes and the 3d phase becomes dominant .",
    "we display typical energy spectrum in each phase in fig.[btflmany ] . in this figure , panels ( b)(c)(d ) all belong to the 3d - butterfly phase , but we can immediately notice that the landau band on which the butterfly appears varies according to where we sit on the phase diagram .",
    "this is because within this phase the 3d butterfly appears when @xmath52 ( eq.[tprimetz ] ) , namely , only the landau level ( not necessarily the lowest ) that has the right width exhibits the butterfly .      in our previous letter , we have numerically estimated the landau - level broadening @xmath30 for the lowest landau band to predict when 3d butterflies appear .",
    "here we give a derivation of the scaling law for @xmath30 introduced there .",
    "consider first an electron in one dimension in the potential @xmath53 ( no @xmath28 ) in eq.([harp3d ] ) .",
    "here we have omitted the phase factor @xmath54 , which has no effect on @xmath30 .",
    "our aim is to express @xmath30 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "harper s equation in this case is @xmath56 we have assumed the period of @xmath27 is much greater than the lattice constant , so the equation can be cast into a differential equation up to a constant , @xmath57 we again take @xmath40 as the unit of energy .",
    "if we measure the length in the well spacing by introducing @xmath58 the equation becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the rescaled energy .",
    "this equation indicates that the form of the wave function depends only on @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath30 depends on the overlap of the neighboring wave functions and the amplitude of the periodic potential @xmath27 , @xmath30 can be written as @xmath62 where the function @xmath63 , which only depends on the landau index , represents the overlap of the neighboring wave functions .",
    "hence we have only to calculate @xmath64 for one value of @xmath24 . in the limit of large barrier between neighboring wells , @xmath65",
    ", @xmath63 vanishes exponentially . in the opposite limit of @xmath66 ,",
    "wells become shallow , so that the transfer to the second- ( and more distant ) neighbor transfers can not be neglected , and the approximation should fail .",
    "this argument can be used for each of the landau levels .",
    "higher levels have larger @xmath30 since the wave function bound in the well is more extended .",
    "so , taking account of the clear butterfly condition @xmath52 , we find that as @xmath45 is increased the landau level in which butterfly appears becomes higher , as we have seen in fig.[btflmany ] .",
    "so far we have assumed that the magnetic field lies in the plane ( @xmath15 ) normal to the conductive axis .",
    "so the next question is whether we can relax this condition for realizing the butterfly .",
    "about ten years ago , several authors investigated 3d hofstadter problem in arbitrarily oriented magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "they have shown that , even if each of three components of magnetic field is not zero , schrdinger s equation can be transformed into a one dimensional tight - binding problem with distant - neighbor hoppings .",
    "namely , if we choose a vector potential that depends on both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the equation , reduced to a 1d tight - binding equation , has @xmath67- and @xmath68-distant hoppings where @xmath69 with @xmath70 being coprime integers . we can adopt this gauge to calculate the 3d butterfly for @xmath8 here .",
    "the result for the energy spectra when the magnetic field is tilted away from the @xmath15 plane ( @xmath71 ) is shown in fig.[btflbx ] .",
    "surprisingly , the spectrum is almost identical to that for @xmath72 ( fig.[btflbx](a ) ) . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic field component parallel to the conductive direction , which would promote the motion along that direction , has unexpectedly little effect on the 3d butterfly .",
    "so the puzzle is : why is the 3d butterfly so robust ?",
    "the tight - binding model with distant hoppings can not be reduced to the effective 2d harper s equation as is done here in going from eq.([harp3d ] ) to eq.([harpeff ] ) , so we must take another approach .",
    "we consider a 3d butterfly system ( @xmath73 ) in a magnetic field @xmath74 .",
    "we take the vector potential @xmath75 , so that @xmath6 is a cyclic coordinate and the wave function becomes @xmath76 where @xmath77 labels @xmath78 .",
    "schrdinger s equation becomes @xmath79 g_{mn } = e g_{mn } , \\label{newharp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the number of flux quanta penetrating the facet of the unit cell normal to the @xmath81 axis .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath72 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is just the case we considered in the first part of this paper , but the equation can not be reduced to a 2d harper s equation due to the different gauge .",
    "nevertheless , we can derive an effective 2d harper equation in the following manner .    in eq.([newharp ] ) , the assumption @xmath83 means the amplitude of the cosine potential , @xmath84 $ ] , is much greater than the hopping terms along @xmath85 ( first two terms in eq.([newharp ] ) ) .",
    "so the states are basically bound to a ` trough ' of the cosine potential . in this sense ,",
    "the state is quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "so let us derive an effective schdinger s equation within the trough .",
    "if we switch off @xmath45 for the moment , the set of equations for different @xmath86 s are decoupled to give @xmath87 g^{0}_{mn }     = e^0_n g^{0}_{mn } , \\label{newharp0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is an equation for one variable @xmath88 , and the eigenstates are bound states in a cosine potential . if @xmath45 is turned on , the states having different values of @xmath89 are mixed to form a tight - binding band ( fig.[trough ] ) .",
    "the band width is proportional to @xmath45 times the overlap , @xmath90 , between neighboring bound states having a slightly different center positions .",
    "the equation can now be reduced to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the amplitude of the bound states at @xmath86 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath93 in eq.([newharp0 ] ) depends on @xmath86 , since the set of values of a steep cosine potential at discrete points have a discommensuration that is periodic in @xmath86 with a period @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath95 in eq.([newharp0 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath96 ) .",
    "we can check by the numerical calculation that the @xmath93 can be approximated with a cosine function , whose amplitude is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the equation ( [ newharpeff ] ) becomes @xmath97 j_n = e j_n .",
    "\\label{newharpeff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the effective harper equation in this approach .",
    "this equation has the same set of eigenvalues as those of eq.([harpeff ] ) as it should .",
    "if we assume @xmath98 , we can prove that @xmath30 in eqs.([newharpeff2 ] ) and ( [ harpeff ] ) are identical .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ newharpeff2 ] ) has the same form as eq.([harpeff ] ) except that @xmath30 and @xmath45 are exchanged . in the 2d harper equation , exchanging the two hoppings does not change the energy spectrum because of the gauge invariance , which concludes the proof .",
    "the new effective equation can easily be extended to the arbitrarily oriented magnetic fields .",
    "if @xmath99 is turned on , the bound states in a trough feel a magnetic field @xmath99 parallel to the @xmath15 plane .",
    "if the state were purely one - dimensional , it would not be affected by magnetic fields .",
    "so the problem is to what extent we can neglect the effect of @xmath99 on the quasi - one - dimensional state .",
    "we assume @xmath100 again .",
    "if one considers the state having an energy @xmath101 above the bottom , the width of the wave function can be estimated as @xmath102 , while the length scale over which the peierls phase due to @xmath99 changes is @xmath103 .",
    "thus we can say @xmath99 has a minor effect on the 3d butterfly when @xmath104 in the opposite limit , @xmath105 , we have only to replace @xmath24 with @xmath23 in the inequality . in our example",
    "above , the condition , for the lowest landau band , becomes @xmath106 , which is indeed satisfied in fig.[btflbx ] .",
    "the semiclassical picture is often employed in examining the motion of electrons in magnetic field .",
    "so this section addresses the question of whether or not the present approach in terms of harper s equation can be interpreted in the semiclassical approach .",
    "we shall conclude that the semiclassical approach _ can not _ describe the butterfly physics .    in the semiclassical approximation , an electron in @xmath107-space moves along the intersection of the equienergy surface with a plane perpendicular to @xmath3 .",
    "if the orbit closes in @xmath107-space , we may apply bohr - sommerfeld s quantization condition , @xmath108 which requires that the area enclosed by the orbit must be a multiple of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the magnetic length .    on the other hand , in harper s equation ,",
    "the binding in wells gives the quantized states .",
    "let us start with identifying the correspondence between two quantizations , which look different at first sight . in the following",
    ", we again assume the conditions @xmath111 , which are our starting point in deriving the effective harper equation .",
    "the energy dispersion , in the absence of magnetic fields , is @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the lattice constants along @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "first we consider a semiclassical orbit around @xmath114 point , around which @xmath115 can be approximated , up to a constant , as @xmath116 an equienergy surface is then represented by an ellipsoid . for @xmath3",
    "tilted by an angle @xmath117 from @xmath26 axis , the area enclosed by the orbit around @xmath114 having an energy @xmath101 is @xmath118 applying the quantization condition , we obtain the quantized energy , @xmath119    around the @xmath120 point , @xmath121 on the edge of the brillouin zone , on the other hand , @xmath115 can be approximated as @xmath122 this time the equienergy surface is hyperbolic along @xmath26 , while elliptic along @xmath123 .",
    "the area of an orbit encircling x is @xmath124 and the quantized energy is @xmath125    what corresponds to the quantized energy ( [ elliptic ] ) or ( [ hyperbolic ] ) in harper s equation ?",
    "the potential in harper s equation consists of two periodic terms , @xmath126 as discussed above , if the condition @xmath127 is satisfied , @xmath27 is responsible for potential peaks and dips while @xmath28 provides a slowly varying part .",
    "the energy quanta are determined by the curvature of the wells .",
    "while the curvature depends mainly on @xmath27 , @xmath28 also gives an additional contribution .",
    "let us consider the well around a minimum of @xmath28 .",
    "we can express the bottom of the well in a harmonic form , @xmath128 the energy quantum is then given by @xmath129 which is identical with eq.([elliptic ] ) . around a maximum of @xmath28 ,",
    "the potential is written as @xmath130 note that @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the opposite curvatures in this case .",
    "the energy quantum is @xmath131 which is identical with eq.([hyperbolic ] ) .",
    "these indicate that a semiclassical orbit in @xmath107-space translates to a bound state in a well . in harper",
    "s equation , however , a bound state of one well is not an eigenstate but hops to adjacent wells , i.e. , bound states in different wells are mixed , which is exactly why each landau level is broadened by the hopping @xmath30 . we have seen that this effect is essential in explaining the butterfly structure . hence we can conclude that the butterfly is _ outside _ the semiclassical description .",
    "once the spectrum with a recursive set of energy gaps are obtained , a most important question is whether an integer quantum hall effect exists on that spectrum .",
    "montambaux and kohmoto have first obtained the quantized hall conductance for three dimensional tight - binding electrons in magnetic fields following the line of the results for the 2d case@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we derive , following their arguments , the systematics in the hall conductivity for the 3d butterfly spectrum .",
    "although the results are the same as in our earlier paper , we have greatly simplified the derivation .",
    "let us go back to harper s equation ( [ harp3d ] ) for the simple cubic lattice in rational magnetic fluxes @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath39 , we can adopt the effective - mass approach for the lattice structure along @xmath6 , and the equation reduces to a differential form , @xmath133 f(x ) = e f(x ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the dispersion along @xmath6 axis .",
    "now the equation is doubly periodic just as in 2d .",
    "if we assume @xmath136 ( @xmath137 : integers ) , we end up with a diophantine equation for the @xmath138-th gap , @xmath139 where @xmath140 are topologically invariant integers , constant in each gap .",
    "thus , the number of states per unit volume below the @xmath138th gap is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the total volume of the system .",
    "according to the widom - steda formula @xcite , the hall conductivity when the fermi level is in a gap is written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the density of electrons for a fixed chemical potential and @xmath145 is the unit antisymmetric tensor . substituting eq.([numofstates ] ) for @xmath144 , we finally obtain @xmath146    this is the explicit formula for the hall conductivity derived from montambaux - kohmoto s argument .",
    "we can then calculate the hall conductivity for an arbitrary gap in the 3d butterfly .",
    "the result for the hall conductivity is shown in fig.[btflhall](a ) for the spectrum displayed in fig.[btflbx](a ) .    if we compare this with the corresponding plot for 2d in fig.[btflhall](b )",
    ", we can see that there exists a beautiful correspondence between 2d and 3d cases : @xmath147 in 3d corresponds to @xmath148 in 2d .",
    "the mapping between 2d and 3d harper equations explains this in a transparent manner .",
    "let us consider the fermi level lying in the @xmath149th butterfly gap in the @xmath150th landau level in the 3d butterfly . since one landau band is composed of @xmath151 butterfly bands , the total gap number @xmath138 from the bottom is @xmath152 .",
    "the diophantine equation ( [ dio3d ] ) then reads @xmath153 on the other hand , according to the argument by thouless et al@xcite , the hall conductivity in 2d for the flux @xmath154 is given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is an integer given by the diophantine equation for the @xmath157th gap , @xmath158 recalling the 2d-3d mapping , we can establish a correspondence @xmath159 namely , the correspondence between the topological invariants reads @xmath160 this relation explains the correspondence between @xmath147 in 3d and @xmath148 in 2d as displayed in the fig.[btflhall ] .",
    "we can ask how the hall conductivities vary when the magnetic field is tilted away from the @xmath15 plane ( with @xmath161 ) . as shown in the sec.[secbx ] , @xmath99 preserves the butterfly structure unless its magnitude is too large .",
    "this implies that the hall conductivities , being topological invariants , are not affected by the tilting .",
    "let us comment on the possibility of observing the 3d butterfly in real materials . in the 2d case , the magnetic flux @xmath162 required for the butterfly",
    "is the order of unity , that is , @xmath163 . if one assumes an atomic lattice constant @xmath164 @xmath165 t , which is obviously too huge . in the 3d case on the other hand , fig.[phase ]",
    "shows that there exists appropriate @xmath166 for the 3d butterfly no matter how small @xmath167 may be .",
    "so , for a given lattice constant , the butterfly is more easily realized in 3d .    in practice ,",
    "appropriate @xmath166 become small for small values of the fluxes .",
    "the energy scale then shrinks when the magnetic field is small , so that it will become harder to resolve the butterfly structure . for typical",
    "quasi-1d organic conductors such as ( tmtsf)@xmath168x@xcite we have @xmath169 with @xmath170 , and we can estimate the required magnetic field to be @xmath171 which is _ two _ orders of magnitude smaller than the 2d counterpart , @xmath172 .",
    "@xmath173 corresponds to @xmath174 t , which is well within the experimental feasibility .",
    "the energy scale ( the required energy resolution ) is @xmath175 mev . in our earlier paper,@xcite",
    "we have focused on the lowest landau level in estimating the required field for the butterfly , which required a much larger flux ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "so the important message here is that , if we employ higher landau levels , the condition is drastically relaxed , since the higher levels have larger harper - broadening .    the electron - electron interaction , ignored here , can be significant in real materials .",
    "although it may first seem that the interaction would smear out the butterfly , we can show that it can rather give rise to the butterfly .",
    "for an organic metal ( tmtsf)@xmath168x , it has been known that the many - body interaction causes a spin density wave to become stable in strong magnetic fields , which is called the field - induced spin density wave ( fisdw)@xcite . there , an energy gap opens across the sdw nesting wave vector on the fermi surface , and the hoppings @xmath51 and @xmath45 give rise to series of gaps for electron and hole bands around the sdw gap@xcite . in ( tmtsf)@xmath168x where @xmath177 , @xmath45 happens to be too small to play a role , so that the spectrum is 2d - like , i.e. , has only landau levels around the main gap .",
    "we can then propose that , if there are quasi-1d materials that have @xmath178 ( rather than @xmath179 ) , the spectrum is expected to have 3d butterfly gaps according to the present theory .",
    "this mechanism is interesting , since the butterfly formation , being sdw related , is around @xmath180 by construction .",
    "the detail will be published elsewhere .",
