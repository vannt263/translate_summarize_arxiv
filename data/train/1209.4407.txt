    "mass is the fundamental property that sets the evolutionary path of a star .",
    "the masses of young stars are of particular interest in many astrophysical problems : they provide unique information about the star formation process ( e.g. , accretion histories , the initial mass function ; see * ? ? ? * ) and are thought to have a substantial influence on the evolution of their circumstellar material , and therefore the efficiency of the planet formation process ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , measurements of pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) star masses are difficult and accordingly rare . unlike their more evolved counterparts , the location of a young star in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram does not provide a robust estimate of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models for stellar evolution at these early stages are plagued with uncertainties related to rotation @xcite , accretion @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , atmosphere properties ( e.g. , convection , opacities ; * ? ? ?",

    "the astrometric monitoring technique offers a constraint on the quantity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the sum of the stellar masses and @xmath14 is the distance to the binary . generally , the stellar mass estimates from these methods are inherently uncertain due to their strong dependences on the unknown values of @xmath11 or @xmath14 .",

    "] we adopt a modeling formalism motivated by @xcite , which makes three basic assumptions about disk properties .",
    "first , the disk material is assumed to be orbiting in keplerian rotation around a point mass , meaning the central stars are treated as one object that dominates the disk velocity field .",
    "previous work has found little evidence to support ( simple parametric ) deviations from keplerian @xmath37-fields in disks ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the corollary criterion that the disk mass is only a small fraction of the stellar mass ( @xmath38 ) can be confirmed _ a posteriori _ ( see  4 ) .",
    "second , the disk is assumed to be geometrically thin at all radii . although @xcite argued that this may not be valid at very large radii ( @xmath27800au ) , the higher @xmath9 for the v4046 sgr binary ( which decreases the disk scale height ; see below ) and the limited extent of the co emission from its disk ( @xmath39400au ) suggest it is a reasonable approximation in this case . and third , in the context of the disk structure , we assume that the gas is vertically isothermal and in hydrostatic pressure equilibrium .",
    "a more realistic model would include a temperature inversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , excluding that kind of added complexity does not diminish the accuracy of an @xmath9 estimate : the emission from a single co line is generated in a narrow vertical layer of the disk atmosphere , which has a roughly constant temperature @xcite .    the model for the gas density distribution",
    "is constructed in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the radial surface density profile and @xmath45 is the pressure scale height at each radius .",
    "we assume a parametric version of the former that is appropriate for an accretion disk with a static , power - law viscosity profile @xcite and is currently the basis for most dust - based disk density measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a density gradient , @xmath48 is a characteristic radius , and @xmath49 is a normalization equivalent to @xmath50 .",
    "the scale heights are calculated with the explicit assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and a constant vertical temperature profile , such that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sound speed , @xmath53 is the angular velocity , @xmath54 is the radial temperature profile , @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath56 is the gravitational constant , @xmath57 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight of the gas .",
    "we further assume a simple power - law behavior for the radial temperature profile , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a temperature gradient and @xmath61 is the gas temperature at a radius of 10au .",
    "the parametric descriptions in equations ( 1)-(4 ) completely characterize the temperature and density structure of a model gas disk .",
    "the gas kinematics are described by a keplerian velocity field , @xmath62 meaning there is only rotation , and no net motion in the radial or vertical dimensions .",
    "given a physical disk structure , we can construct a model of the co @xmath1=2@xmath21 emission with the added assumption that the energy levels relevant for this transition are populated according to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "although the lte approximation is not always valid in protoplanetary disks , @xcite demonstrated that it is an appropriate simplification for the low energy and high optical depths associated with this particular species and transition .",
    "we model the emission line intensity distribution by integrating the radiative transfer equation along each sight line @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath66 is the source function ( here equivalent to the planck function ) , and @xmath67 is the optical depth along the line - of - sight . the absorption coefficient is the sum of contributions from dust and gas . for the former ,",
    "we assume @xmath68 , where the dust - to - gas mass ratio is @xmath69 and the grain opacity is @xmath70100ghz)@xmath71 g@xmath22 @xcite . in the particular case of the v4046 sgr disk ,",
    "the contribution of dust to the absorption coefficient is effectively negligible compared to the gas ; the specific choices of @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( within reasonable limitations ) have no tangible effect on our results ( moreover , continuum emission is removed from the data before our modeling analysis ) .",
    "the absorption coefficient of the co gas is calculated from the transition cross section weighted by the population of the lower energy level , @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 ( note that in this specific case , @xmath76 ) .",
    "since we assume the line is thermally populated in lte , the level populations are determined by the local disk temperature via the boltzmann equation , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the transition energy , @xmath79 is the statistical weight , @xmath80 is the partition function , and @xmath81 is the co fractional abundance ( assumed to be constant everywhere in the disk ) .",
    "the details of the emission line model are encoded in the absorption cross section , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the line profile function and the integrated cross section is @xmath84 where we have used the einstein relation in the last equality to express the einstein-@xmath85 coefficient in terms of the einstein-@xmath86 coefficient provided by the lamda molecular database @xcite .",
    "the line profile function naturally determines the shape of the emission line , where a given frequency @xmath87 corresponds to an intrinsic doppler velocity @xmath88 relative to the line center , @xmath89 .",
    "the gas in a given disk model has a projected , line - of - sight velocity field given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the inclination of the disk relative to the observer ( such that @xmath92  is edge - on ; for the geometry , see * ? ? ?",
    "the line profile shape at each frequency is determined by the difference between the doppler and line - of - sight velocities , @xmath93,\\ ] ] and the effective line width , @xmath94 .",
    "the latter is comprised of the quadrature sum of contributions from thermal and non - thermal broadening terms , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mean molecular weight of co and @xmath97 is the contribution from microturbulence .",
    "we assume that the turbulent velocity width @xmath97 is constant throughout the disk .",
    "the @xcite model formalism highlighted above is admittedly complex .",
    "a single model is completely described by 14 parameters : four quantify the distribution of co densities \\{@xmath81 , @xmath49 , @xmath98 , @xmath47 } , two characterize the temperature structure ( and therefore the vertical density structure ) \\{@xmath61 , @xmath60 } , three play pivotal roles describing the disk kinematics \\{@xmath9 , @xmath97 , @xmath89 } , and the remaining five relate the model to the observations ",

    "the disk center coordinates were estimated from both the dust continuum and co emission morphology at the systemic velocity ( see fig .",

    "we adopted the distance inferred by @xcite from the kinematic parallax ( moving cluster ) technique , @xmath19pc ( but see  5 regarding alternative values ) .",
    "some additional practical simplications can be made , since the focus here is on the velocity field and not the disk structure details .",
    "because the line opacity is so much greater than the dust opacity , the normalization parameters @xmath81 and @xmath49 are not independent : we can only constrain their product . in practice ,",
    "we adopt a joint co disk mass parameter , @xmath105 , for that purpose .",
    "moreover , after extensive experimentation , we concluded that two more parameters should be fixed .",
    "first , we found that the disk orientation was very well - determined ( within 1 ) at pa@xmath106 ( e of n ) , so that continued iteration on a more precise value was a waste of computational resources : fixing this parameter has negligible quantitative impact on the other model parameters or their uncertainties .",
    "and second , we fixed the surface density gradient , @xmath107 .",
    "the key parameters that set the density profile , \\{@xmath47 , @xmath48 } are anti - correlated and strongly degenerate ; statistically indistinguishable model fits can be found over a large range of these parameters .",

    "fortunately , this degeneracy has minimal impact on the parameters most relevant for characterizing the disk velocity field : the precision and accuracy of a @xmath9 determination are not notably affected by the uncertainties in \\{@xmath47 , @xmath48}. with that in mind , we have made the modeling process more tractable with a fixed @xmath47 .    making use of those simplifications",

    "those model visibilities are evaluated with respect to the data by computing a composite @xmath108 value , summed over the real and imaginary components in 25 spectral channels .",

    "this spectral energy distribution ( sed ) prediction was generated from an interpolated grid of @xcite model spectra , assuming the appropriate stellar gravities ( @xmath134 in both cases ) , negligible interstellar reddening ( @xmath135 ) , and our adopted @xmath19pc .",
    "representative broadband photometric data are marked as the datapoints in figure [ fig : spectrum ] , constructed from the weighted mean magnitudes of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the 2mass @xcite and denis @xcite surveys : uncertainties were taken as the quadrature sum of the standard deviation of the weighted mean and the maximal deviation from the weighted mean , in an effort to more faithfully represent potential uncertainties due to variability .",
    "a quick examination of figure [ fig : spectrum ] demonstrates that the spectral morphology of the data and model prediction are a good match , although the normalizations appear discrepant .",
    "scaling the ( best - fit ) predicted spectrum down by @xmath730@xmath136%  provides a good match to the observed spectrum ; a composite luminosity of @xmath137l@xmath5 is more appropriate ( _ red curve _ ) .",
    "therefore , the predicted and observed composite binary luminosities are marginally ( @xmath71.4@xmath28 ) different .",
    "although formally the conflict in these luminosity values is not statistically significant , it is still interesting to consider some potential paths for a better reconciliation of all the data .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward means of doing so is to modify the assumed distance to the system : taken at face value , a @xmath730%  increase to @xmath138pc implies an inherently more luminous pair of stars with a spectrum that would be in good agreement with the observations .",
    "however , that same re - normalization impacts the total stellar mass inferred from the co data , with a linear scaling to @xmath139m@xmath5 that introduces a substantial ( @xmath72@xmath28 ) discrepancy in the \\{@xmath9 , @xmath140}-plane between the disk - kinematics and rv techniques for estimating stellar parameters .",
    "although it hardly seems worthwhile to trade one marginal discrepancy for another ( which is technically less marginal ) , there is no _ a priori _ reason that the orbital planes of the disk and binary need to be aligned with the precision inferred in  4 .",
    "unfortunately , little guidance is provided in the form of an uncertainty on the kinematic parallax measurement of @xcite . in any case",
    ", discrepancies in effective temperatures and luminosities are not necessarily uncommon for active young stars @xcite , and particularly for those in close binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ultimately , dwelling on a marginal luminosity discrepancy is not well justified , especially given the independent distance estimate from the @xcite study . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the stellar parameters inferred from the joint constraints of the co disk spatio - kinematics and the optical rv studies of @xcite assuming @xmath19pc , but use individual stellar luminosities scaled down by 30%  to best match the observed optical and near - infrared spectrum : @xmath141l@xmath5 and @xmath142l@xmath5 ( note that each component is slightly less luminous than reported by * ? ? ?",
    "with those results , we can make comparisons with the predictions of pre - ms evolution models to estimate the ages ( @xmath143 ) and masses of the individual stars in the v4046 sgr binary . to accomplish that",
    ", we follow the bayesian methodology of @xcite , which employs a finely - interpolated grid of pre - ms models in the hr diagram to estimate the probability distributions of stellar mass and age given the measured values ( and uncertainties ) of effective temperatures and luminosities ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if we define the observables as \\{@xmath144 , @xmath145 } = \\{@xmath146 , @xmath147 } with associated uncertainties \\{@xmath148 , @xmath149 } , and the pre - ms model predictions \\{@xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath151 } , we can write the likelihood function as a multivariate gaussian , @xmath153\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the best - fit \\{@xmath9 , @xmath143 } are then directly determined from the \\{@xmath154 , @xmath155 } that maximize the likelihood , with uncertainties that can be calculated from the shape of the likelihood distribution .",
    "this procedure was conducted for four different pre - ms evolution models , assuming solar composition , a fractional deuterium abundance of @xmath156 , and a convective mixing parameter @xmath157 - 2.0 : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the results of these comparisons are presented in table [ tab : hr ] .",
    "figure [ fig : hr ] shows the v4046 sgr stellar properties that were inferred from each of the four reference sets of pre - ms evolutionary model tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "all of the evolutionary models make predictions for the v4046 sgr stellar masses that are remarkably consistent with each other and the dynamical masses inferred in  4 .",
    "the stellar masses that formally maximize the likelihood in equation 12 are systematically @xmath72 - 10%  below the best - fit dynamical masses , an under - prediction typical of pre - ms models regardless of the dynamical method used to estimate @xmath9 @xcite . however , those modest discrepancies are not statistically significant , given the uncertainties on \\{@xmath158 , @xmath54 } and the dynamical masses .",
    "an examination of figure [ fig : hr ] demonstrates that the v4046 sgr stars are nearly evolved off the hayashi track , having presumably developed radiative cores as expected for their solar - like masses . the clear implication of their location in the hr diagram is that the v4046 sgr binary is comparatively _ old _ for a pre - ms system , as has been previously reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models used here suggest a large range of ages are plausible , from @xmath75 - 30myr , and confirm that the binary components are coeval . if we include a gaussian prior representing the dynamical masses into the bayesian analysis of the hr diagrams described above ( labeled as ` + dyn ' in table [ tab : hr ] ) , we can infer a smaller range of acceptable  dynamical \" ages from each set of pre - ms models .",
    "the different pre - ms model predictions with these dynamical priors are shown together , and averaged ( weighted by the posterior probability for each model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in figure [ fig : ages ] : the averaged results suggest ages of @xmath159 and @xmath160myr for v4046 sgr a and b , respectively . the corresponding coeval age is 13@xmath161myr , in good agreement with the age constraints from the putative far - flung companion(s ) v4046 sgr c[d ] ( at a separation of @xmath712,350au , or 28 on the sky ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the observed space motion of v4046 sgr is consistent with a high probability of membership in the @xmath18 pic moving group , a widespread and local ( @xmath162pc ) stellar association with an age range estimated to be @xmath78 - 20myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematic parallax calculated by torres et al .",
    "( @xmath3pc ) and component ages estimated here for the v4046 sgr binary are certainly supportive of that conclusion .",
    "if that is the case , it is worth noting the uniqueness of the v4046 sgr circumstellar environment : there are no other @xmath18 pic moving group members that are known to host such a massive , long - lived , gas - rich accretion disk . regardless of its original association , the proximity and advanced age of v4046 sgr make for a remarkable case study in both the long - term evolution of protoplanetary disk structure and the fundamental properties of pre - ms binary stars .    although v4046 sgr is a particularly striking example of the methodology behind disk - based dynamical estimates of stellar masses , we anticipate that these techniques will find considerably more use in the near future as the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) project is completed . even with vastly improved data quality , this simplified model to extract the gas disk rotation curve from such interferometric observations ( see  3 ) remains complex",
    ". however , we have demonstrated that the method is robust , accurate , and precise , by using independent dynamical constraints from the v4046 sgr spectroscopic binary radial velocity monitoring results . in practice , these constraints and others like them ( notably for uz tau e ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) effectively serve as a check on the absolute calibration of the modeling technique described in  3 .",
    "the consistency between the independent dynamical constraints on the v4046 sgr stellar masses validates the application of this procedure to dynamically  weigh \" single , isolated pre - ms stars based on their gas disk kinematics .",
    "along with an investment in accurate stellar luminosity and temperature measurements , alma observations of the molecular gas kinematics in circumstellar disks will usher in a new era of precision in the fundamental astrophysical properties of young stars .",
    "we have presented sensitive , high - resolution sma observations of the @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 line emission from the massive , gas - rich disk orbiting the double - lined spectroscopic binary star v4046 sgr . using simple radiation transfer calculations for a disk structure model with a keplerian velocity field",
    ", we fit the observed spectral visibilities using a stochastic model optimization technique that simultaneously infers model parameter values and their uncertanties .",
    "our specific focus has been on the key model parameters that describe the disk velocity field , with a goal of placing a firm , dynamical constraint on the mass of the central binary .",
    "the key conclusions of our analysis are :    1 .   from modeling the co line emitted by the circumbinary disk",
    ", we infer that the total stellar mass of the v4046 sgr binary is @xmath163 , assuming the kinematic parallax distance of 73pc estimated by @xcite .",
    "that measurement is in excellent agreement with the independent dynamical constraints imposed from the analysis of an optical spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the radial velocity variations from the binary itself @xcite .",
    "the mutual consistency of these distinct dynamical constraints on the stellar masses verifies that the mass determination based on the velocity field of the disk gas is accurate in an absolute sense , as well as remarkably precise ( with a 3 - 5% formal uncertainty on @xmath9 ) .",
    "that same combination of constraints from millimeter and optical spectroscopic measurements confirm that the orbital planes of the stars and their accompanying circumbinary disk are co - planar , with inferred inclination angles ( @xmath6 and @xmath164 ) that differ by @xmath165  over roughly four decades in radius , from @xmath70.04 to 400au .",
    "4 .   the inferred component masses of the v4046 sgr binary are in uniformly good agreement with a variety of pre - ms evolution model predictions .",
    "when combined with our dynamical constraints , those same models confirm the coevality of the binary components , and suggest an average age for the system of @xmath166myr .",
