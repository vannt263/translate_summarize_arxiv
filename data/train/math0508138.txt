    "meanwhile , one has to deal with several problems .",
    "for example , as shown in expression ( [ eqn : jwd ] ) , although the volume conjecture itself is only concerned with the value of the colored jones polynomial @xmath2 at the @xmath34-th root of unity , the values at other roots of unity become crucial once the satellite knots of @xmath0 are involved .    a more challenging problem is due to the estimations ( [ eqn : torus_est1a ] ) and ( [ eqn : torus_est1b ] ) , which have enabled us to neglect the term @xmath236 in summation ( [ eqn : wd ] ) .",
    "note that the derivative of the polynomial @xmath237 is related to @xmath2 via the identity @xmath238 therefore , the term @xmath239 in summation ( [ eqn : wd ] ) , in fact , plays the role of @xmath119 .",
    "hence it is quite natural to see the term @xmath236 be suppressed . following this observation , when the whitehead doubles of general knots are considered , it is reasonable to expect that a similar suppression also happens .    for every nontrivial knot @xmath0 we have @xmath240 uniformly on @xmath241 for some @xmath99 .",
    "note that the conjecture excludes the case of unknot , for which the statement of the conjecture is obviously false .",
    "indeed , the whitehead doubles of unknot are no longer satellite knots but the so called twist knots ( including unknot , trefoil , figure 8 , etc . ) , whose complements always admit a volume strictly smaller than that of whitehead link . in the sequel , the conjecture has an interesting implication : the colored jones polynomial detects unknot .",
