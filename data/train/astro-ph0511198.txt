    "inflation has become the dominant paradigm to understand the initial conditions for the density perturbations in the early universe , which are the seeds for the large - scale structure ( lss ) and for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xcite . in the inflationary picture ,",
    "primordial density and gravity - wave fluctuations are created from quantum fluctuations and `` redshifted '' out of the horizon during an early period of superluminal expansion of the universe .    despite the simplicity of the inflationary concept , the mechanism by which cosmological curvature ( adiabatic ) perturbations are generated",
    "is not yet established . in the standard slow - roll inflationary scenario associated with a single inflaton field ,",
    "density perturbations are due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton itself . in the curvaton mechanism @xcite , the final curvature perturbation @xmath2 is produced from an initial isocurvature mode associated with quantum fluctuations of a light scalar ( other than the inflaton ) , the curvaton , whose energy density is negligible during inflation and which decays much after the end of inflation .",
    "recently , we have proposed an alternative scenario for the generation of the comoving curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "the idea is that if the inflaton sector is characterized by an _ approximate _",
    "global symmetry , the associated pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson(s ) may be quantum mechanically excited during inflation .",
    "this results in different initial conditions in separate horizon volumes for the ( pre)heating stage after the end of inflation .",
    "these different initial conditions will give rise to fluctuations in the comoving number densities of the light relativistic states produced during the decay process and , ultimately , to cmb anisotropies .",
    "other mechanisms for the generation of cosmological perturbations have been proposed as well , such as the inhomogeneous reheating scenario @xcite , ghost - inflation @xcite , and the d - celeration scenario @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "given all these theoretical models , it is very important to find ways to discriminate among them based on observational evidence . a precise measurement of the spectral index of comoving curvature perturbations @xmath3 will provide a powerful constraint to slow - roll inflation models and to the standard scenario for the generation of cosmological perturbations , which predicts @xmath4 significantly below unity .",
    "however , alternative mechanisms generally also predict a value of @xmath3 very close to unity .",
    "thus , even a precise measurement of the spectral index will not allow us to discriminate efficiently among them .",
    "also , the lack of gravity - wave signals in cmb anisotropies will not provide any information about the perturbation generation mechanism , since alternative mechanisms predict an amplitude of gravity waves far too small to be detectable by future experiments aimed at observing the @xmath5-mode of the cmb polarization .",
    "there is , however , a third observable which will prove fundamental in providing information about the mechanism chosen by nature to produce the structures we see today .",
    "it is the deviation from pure gaussian statistics , _",
    "i.e. _ , the presence of higher - order connected correlation functions of cmb anisotropies . since for every scenario there exists a well defined prediction for the strength of non - gaussianity and its dependence on the parameters , testing the non - gaussian level of primordial fluctuations is one of the most powerful probes of inflation @xcite , and is crucial to discriminate among different , but otherwise observationally indistinguishable , mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the single - field slow - roll inflation model produces negligible non - gaussianity , and its dominant contribution arises from the evolution of the ubiquitous second - order perturbations after inflation , which is potentially detectable with future observations of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "this effect _ must exist _ regardless of the specific inflationary model considered , setting a lower bound of the non - gaussianity of cosmological perturbations .",
    "if evidence for this ubiquitous non - gaussianity is not found experimentally , the present understanding of the evolution of cosmological perturbations will be challenged at a very deep level .    motivated by the extreme relevance of pursuing non - gaussianity in the cmb anisotropies , in this paper",
    "we calculate the level of non - gaussianity at large scales in the cmb anisotropies produced in the class of models where the comoving curvature perturbations are generated by broken symmetries in the inflaton sector @xcite . since we will find that in this class of models the non - gaussianity is substantial , as a first approximation it will be possible to neglect the non - linearity generated by gravitational dynamics in the post - inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] we present an overview of the general physical mechanism leading to curvature perturbations production during multi - field inflaton decay .",
    "[ sec : application ] then focuses on the determination of the comoving curvature perturbation produced when the inflaton field is characterized by a broken u(1 ) symmetry and when the decay process is the so - called instant preheating . in sec .",
    "[ sect : calc ] , we carry out the calculation of the non - linearity parameter @xmath0 for the model considered .",
    "[ sect : gr ] then generalizes such results to determine a general formula for the evaluation of the level of non - gaussianity produced whenever the potential is characterized by a broken symmetry , and summarizes the conclusions .",
    "as a first step , let s analyze the consequences of assuming an inflationary potential characterized by a global broken symmetry for the production of curvature perturbations during the decay process of the inflaton field .    in what follows , we consider a multi - field inflationary scenario where the scale factor @xmath6 and the background inflaton fields @xmath7 evolve according to the system of coupled differential equations    @xmath8,\\label{gi : h2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 .    as in the standard single - field scenario ,",
    "the multi - field scenario is characterized by an initial slow - roll phase during which quantum fluctuations of all the light degrees of freedom are excited , stretched to macroscopic scales , and frozen in amplitude once their wavelength exceeds the hubble radius .",
    "it is important to note that in the single - field scenario only fluctuations parallel to the direction of motion in field space could be generated .",
    "as was shown in refs.@xcite , these fluctuations would later correspond to _",
    "adiabatic _ perturbations . in the multi - field case ,",
    "on the other hand , fluctuations both parallel _ and _ orthogonal to the direction of motion in field space can be excited , the latter corresponding to _ isocurvature _ perturbations . in general , then , at the end of the slow roll phase the value of the background inflaton field will have acquired a spatial dependence @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the epoch after termination of the slow - roll phase but before the decay process .",
    "it is necessary to point out that up to this point in the evolution history of the universe the only difference between the single - field and the multi - field scenarios consists of the fact that field perturbations in the former case are of the adiabatic type only , while in the latter case they consist of both adiabatic _ and _ isocurvature perturbations .    moving on to the next phase in the evolution history of the universe , it is very important to note that the quantum fluctuations imprinted onto the value of the inflaton fields during the slow - roll phase also represent , through eq .",
    "( [ gi : deltaphi ] ) , perturbations in the _ initial conditions _ for the evolution of the background fields @xmath12 during the decay phase . similar to a chaotic mechanical system , _ if _ the potential @xmath13 is characterized by a global broken symmetry , the system of differential equations eqs.([gi : backdyn],[gi : h2 ] ) then exhibits a sensitive dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "this fact , in turn , guarantees that different initial conditions will correspond to evolution histories for the background fields @xmath14 for @xmath15 which do not just differ from one another by a simple time translation . then to summarize , the broken symmetry of the potential is sufficient to guarantee that the field perturbations generated during the slow - roll phase will correspond to field trajectories @xmath14 that will differ substantially in the subsequent phase of inflaton decay .    moving on to consider the decay process",
    ", it is clear that if the inflaton fields @xmath12 have to decay into some other particles @xmath16 , then the two must necessarily be connected by an interaction lagrangian @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , this interaction lagrangian necessarily must depend on the value of the fields involved , @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "denoting by @xmath18 the comoving number density of @xmath16 particles produced during the decay process , it is then trivial to note that such a quantity will be a ( usually very complicated ) functional of the evolution histories of the background fields .",
    "but since the field trajectories will depend on the initial conditions set at time @xmath11 , then formally we may write @xmath19.\\ ] ]    in a multi - field scenario the perturbations generated during the slow - roll phase will appear as perturbations of the initial conditions for the evolution of the background fields during the decay stage .",
    "this will in turn result in fluctuations in the comoving number density of particles produced @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the end of the decay process .    to determine the curvature perturbations produced during such a decay process , it is sufficient to note that the generated energy density is proportional to the comoving number density of produced particles , @xmath22 .",
    "assuming for simplicity complete decay , an estimate of the curvature perturbation @xmath2 generated during this phase is then @xmath23 where in the last step the _ spatially flat gauge _ has been assumed and @xmath24 is a proportionality constant whose numerical value depends on the redshifting of the particle produced .",
    "the level of the non - gaussianity produced is usually specified using the non - linearity parameter @xmath0 , which determines the non - gaussian contribution to the bardeen potential @xmath25 according to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gaussian part of the bardeen potential .",
    "it is then possible to connect @xmath25 to @xmath2 through ) connecting @xmath25 and @xmath2 is valid only at linear order .",
    "it is nonetheless correct to use it provided that the value of the non - gaussianity parameter is larger than unity , which will be the case in what follows . ]",
    "@xmath28 where in the last step the expression for the curvature perturbation @xmath2 produced in the present model has been used .",
    "it seems important to stress here that the _ only _ crucial assumption made so far concerns the global broken symmetry of the potential .",
    "if the symmetry is unbroken , it is possible to see that the perturbations of the initial conditions would produce evolution histories of the background fields @xmath14 which would only differ by a time translation : the curvature perturbations thus produced would simply represent a gauge artifact and could be gauged away by a suitable choice of the slicing and threading .",
    "the only other assumption made is that the inflaton decays into the @xmath16 field through the non - perturbative process of preheating , but this assumption is not crucial to the final conclusions that fluctuations in the initial conditions at the beginning of the decay stage would yield fluctuations in the energy density and therefore in the curvature .",
    "curvature perturbations produced through this mechanism can be characterized by significant degree of non - gaussianity .",
    "the next section contains a simple example which shows how it is possible to determine the value of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 in a specific case .",
    "because of the general characteristics of the process being considered  a sensitive dependence of the field - space trajectories on the initial conditions and the non - perturbative nature of the preheating process  the general evaluation of the curvature perturbation and of the non - linearity parameter generated usually require a numerical approach . in this section the _ instant preheating _ model of felder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is considered in order to obtain an analytic estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that while the choice of the specific preheating model is in part dictated by computational convenience , the results of the present section can be easily generalized to take into account different decay processes and background - field spaces .    to proceed",
    "further it is necessary to specify two details that so far have been left undetermined : the characteristics of the background - field space ( dimensionality , potential , and broken symmetry ) and the details of the preheating mechanism .",
    "the former determines the field trajectories @xmath14 , while the latter allows the specification of the functional relating the trajectories to the comoving density of particles produced , @xmath29 $ ] .      proceeding as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dimensionality of the field space is chosen to be 2 , so that the inflaton - field landscape is described by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this choice reflects the fact that curvature perturbations and possibly non - gaussianity can arise in the simplest multi - field inflationary scenario .",
    "the complex field @xmath32 can then be introduced : @xmath33    the potential @xmath34 , which is characterized by a slightly broken u(1 ) symmetry , can be modeled close to its minimum by @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 represents a measure of the symmetry breaking .",
    "this choice for the potential landscape allows one to determine analytically the field trajectories @xmath14 if the hubble expansion is neglected for the short time period during which the decay process occurs ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
