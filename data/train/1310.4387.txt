    "since 1760 , when the swiss mathematician daniel bernoulli published a study on the impact of immunization with cowpox , the process of protecting individuals from infection by immunization has become a routine , with historical success in reducing both mortality and morbidity @xcite .",
    "the impact of vaccination may be regarded not only as an individual protective measure , but also as a collective one . while direct individual protection is the major focus of a mass vaccination program",
    ", the effects on population also contribute indirectly to other individual protection through herd immunity , providing protection for unprotected individuals @xcite .",
    "this means that when we have a large neighborhood of vaccinated people , a susceptible individual has a lower probability in coming into contact with the infection , being more difficult for diseases to spread , which decreases the relief of health facilities and can break the chain of infection .",
    "dengue is a vector - borne disease that transcends international borders .",
    "it is transmitted to humans through mosquito bite , mainly the _ aedes aegypti_. in this process the female mosquito acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person .",
    "the blood is necessary to feed their eggs .",
    "larvae hatch when water inundates the eggs as a result of rains or an addition of water by people .",
    "when the larva has acquired enough energy and size , metamorphosis is done , changing the larva into pupa . the newly formed adult emerges from the water after breaking the pupal skin .",
    "this process could lasts between 8 to 10 days @xcite .",
    "vector control remains the only available strategy against dengue . despite integrated vector control with community participation , along with active disease surveillance and insecticides ,",
    "there are only a few examples of successful dengue prevention and control on a national scale @xcite .",
    "besides , the levels of resistance of _ aedes aegypti _ to insecticides has increased , which implies shorter intervals between treatments , and only few insecticide products are available in the market due to the high costs for development and registration and low returns @xcite .",
    "dengue vaccines have been under development since the 1940s , but due to the limited appreciation of global disease burden and the potential markets for dengue vaccines , industry interest languished throughout the 20th century . however , in recent years",
    ", the development of dengue vaccines has dramatically accelerated with the increase in dengue infections , as well as the prevalence of all four circulating serotypes .",
    "faster development of a vaccine became a serious concern @xcite .",
    "economic analysis are conducted to guide public support for vaccine development in both industrialized and developing countries , including a previous cost - effectiveness study of dengue @xcite .",
    "the authors of these works compared the cost of the disease burden with the possibility of making a vaccination campaign ; they suggest that there is a potential economic benefit associated with promising dengue interventions , such as dengue vaccines and vector control innovations , when compared to the cost associated to the disease treatments . constructing",
    "a successful vaccine for dengue has been challenging : the knowledge of disease pathogenesis is insufficient and in addition the vaccine must protect simultaneously against all serotypes in order to not increase the level of dengue haemorrhagic fever @xcite .",
    "currently , the features of a dengue vaccine are mostly unknown . therefore , in this paper we opt to present a set of simulations with different efficacy and different ways of distributing the vaccine .",
    "we have also explored the vaccination process under two different perspectives . in section  [ sec:7:2 ] a new compartment in the model",
    "is used and several kinds of vaccines are considered . in section  [ sec:7:3 ] ,",
    "a second perspective is studied using the vaccination process as a disease control in the mathematical formulation . in that case the theory of optimal control is applied .",
    "both methods assume a continuous vaccination strategy .",
    "the interaction human - mosquito is detailed in a previous work by the authors @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the notation used in our mathematical model includes four epidemiological states for humans :    @xmath0  : :    susceptible ( individuals who can contract the disease ) ; @xmath1  : :    vaccinated ( individuals who were vaccinated and are now immune ) ; @xmath2  : :    infected ( individuals who are capable of transmitting the disease ) ; @xmath3  : :    resistant ( individuals who have acquired immunity ) .",
    "it is assumed that the total human population @xmath4 is constant , so , @xmath5 .",
    "the compartment @xmath6 represents the group of human population that is vaccinated , in order to distinguish the resistance obtained through vaccination and the one achieved by disease recovery .",
    "there are also three other state variables , related to the mosquitoes :    @xmath7  : :    aquatic phase ( includes the eggs , larva and pupa stages ) ; @xmath8  : :    susceptible ( mosquitoes able to contract the disease ) ; @xmath9  : :    infected ( mosquitoes capable of transmitting the disease to humans ) .    similarly to the human population",
    ", it is assumed that the total adult mosquito population is constant , which means @xmath10 .",
    "there is no resistant phase in mosquitoes due to its short lifespan and the fact that the coefficient of disease transmission is considered fixed .",
    "another assumption is the susceptibility of the humans and mosquitoes when they born .",
    "the parameters of the model are :    @xmath11  : :    total population ; @xmath12  : :    average number of bites on humans by mosquitoes , per day ; @xmath13  : :    transmission probability from @xmath14 ( per bite ) ; @xmath15  : :    transmission probability from @xmath16 ( per bite ) ; @xmath17  : :    average lifespan of humans ( in days ) ; @xmath18  : :    mean viremic period ( in days ) ; @xmath19  : :    average lifespan of adult mosquitoes ( in days ) ; @xmath20  : :    number of eggs at each deposit per capita ( per day ) ; @xmath21  : :    natural mortality of larvae ( per day ) ; @xmath22  : :    maturation rate from larvae to adult ( per day ) ; @xmath23  : :    female mosquitoes per human ; @xmath24  : :    number of larvae per human .",
    "two forms of random vaccination are possible .",
    "the most common to reduce the prevalence of an endemic disease is pediatric vaccination ; the alternative being random vaccination of the entire population in an outbreak . in both cases ,",
    "the vaccination can be considered perfect , conferring 100% protection along all life , or imperfect .",
    "this last case can be due to the difficulty of producing an effective vaccine , the heterogeneity of the population or even the life span of the vaccine .      for many potentially human infections , such as measles , mumps , rubella , whooping cough , polio ,",
    "there has been much focus on vaccinating newborns or very young infants .",
    "dengue can be a serious candidate for this type of vaccination . in the @xmath25 model , a continuous vaccination strategy",
    "is considered , where a proportion of the newborn @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 ) , was by default vaccinated .",
    "this model also assumes that the permanent immunity acquired through vaccination is the same as the natural immunity obtained from infected individuals eliminating the disease naturally .",
    "the population remains constant , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 .",
    "the model is represented in figure  [ cap7_modelosvir_newborn ] .    ]",
    "the mathematical formulation is : @xmath28 we are assuming that the vaccine is perfect , which means that it confers life - long protection .",
    "the nontrivial disease - free equilibrium for system is given by @xmath29    as a first step , we determine the basic reproduction number without vaccination ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "[ chap7_thm : r0 ] without vaccination , the basic reproduction number @xmath31 , associated to the differential system , is given by @xmath32    the proof is similar to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we do all the simulations in two scenarios : an epidemic and an endemic situation .",
    "the following values for the parameters of the differential system and initial conditions were used ( tables  [ chap7_parameters ] and [ chap7_initial_conditions ] ) .",
    "these values are based on previous works @xcite .",
    "a small number of initial infected individuals ( @xmath33 ) is considered , to simulate an early action by the health authorities .",
    "we recall that dengue is endemic when it occurs several times in a year , and is not related with the initial value of infected individuals .",
    "moreover , a small initial value of infected individuals in an endemic scenario is in agreement with @xcite . in our work",
    "the same initial value of @xmath16 for both epidemic and endemic scenarios is important in order to compare the development of the disease .",
    ".parameters values of the differential system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude that , assuming a considerable efficacy level of the vaccine , a vaccination campaign in the susceptible population can quickly decrease the number of infected people",
    ". figures  [ eficacia_epidemico ] and [ eficacia_endemic ] show what happens to the optimal solution , in the epidemic and endemic scenarios , respectively , when the efficacy is changed .",
    "these figures confirm an increasing of infected human and control application with an increasing of the waning immunity rate @xmath34 .",
    "the worldwide expansion of dengue fever is a growing health problem . in portugal ,",
    "on october 2012 , for the first time in its history , an outbreak of dengue on the madeira island occurred . besides _",
    "aedes albipictus _ , the other vector that transmits the disease is already in the old continent , namely in italy and spain .",
    "dengue vaccine is an urgent challenge that needs to be overcome .",
    "this may be commercially available within a few years , when the researchers will find a formula that protect against all four dengue viruses .",
    "a vaccination program is seen as an important measure used in infectious disease control and immunization and eradication programs .    in the first part of the paper ,",
    "different ways of distributing the vaccine , as well as their features and some of coverage thresholds , were introduced , in order to cover most of the future vaccine features .",
    "the main goal of a vaccination program is to reduce the prevalence of an infectious disease and ultimately to eradicate it .",
    "it was shown that eradication success depends on the type of vaccine as well as on the vaccination coverage .",
    "the imperfect vaccines may not completely prevent infection but could reduce the probability of being infected , thereby reducing the disease burden . in this study all the simulations were done using epidemic and endemic scenarios to illustrate distinct realities .",
    "a second analysis was made , using an optimal control approach .",
    "the vaccine behaved as a new disease control variable and , when available , can be a promising strategy to fight the disease .",
    "dengue is an infectious tropical disease difficult to prevent and manage .",
    "researchers agree that the development of a vaccine for dengue is a question of high priority . in the present study",
    "we have shown how a vaccine results in reducing morbidity and , simultaneously , in a reduction of the budget related with the disease .",
    "as future work we intend to study the interaction of a dengue vaccine with other kinds of controls already investigated in the literature , such as insecticide and educational campaigns @xcite . it would be also interesting to investigate what happens if the final size of the epidemic is included in the objective functional .",
