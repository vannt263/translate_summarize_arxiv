    "during the last decade , mean field models of spin glasses have motivated increansingly many studies by physicists and mathematicians @xcite .",
    "the rigorous understanding of the infinite volume limit of thermodynamic quantities remained quite insufficient until the recent breakthrough obtained by guerra and toninelli @xcite on their existence and uniqueness .",
    "this major discovery followed by several important results @xcite providing a mathematical interpretation of the original formulae proposed by parisi @xcite on the basis of heuristic arguments .    in this note , without making use of the replica approach ,",
    "we calculate , for a particular value of the ( low ) temperature , the limiting free energy of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model and obtain a lower bound for the density of the ground state energy .",
    "although the limiting free energy is given , for the whole low temperature region , by the rather complicated parisi formula , we obtain , for a given temperature , a very simple expression .",
    "this allows an improvement of all known rigorous bounds for the ground state energy .",
    "we first recall some basic definitions .",

    "let @xmath3 be the spin variable on the site @xmath4 and @xmath5 a generic configuration in the configuration space @xmath6 .",
    "the finite volume hamiltonian of the model is given by the following real - valued function on @xmath7 @xmath8 where the family of couplings @xmath9 are independed centered gaussian random variables of variance @xmath10 .",
    "note however , that the function @xmath11 can equivalently be defined directly on the infinite configuration space @xmath12 and the infinite collection of random variables @xmath13 just by the trivial modification in the definition of @xmath11 : @xmath14{1.07ex}{.1ex}\\hspace{.2ex}}_{\\sigma_n}(\\sigma).\\ ] ] this remark will be instrumental in the course of the proof since only changes the sequence of functions @xmath15 and not the configuration and environment spaces . henceforth , the hamiltonian will be defined on these infinite spaces .    for the inverse temperature @xmath16 , the disorder dependent partition function @xmath17 , is defined by @xmath18 moreover , if @xmath19 denotes the expectation with respect to the randomness @xmath9 , it is very simple to show that @xmath20 .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 , the corresponding gibbs probability measure , conditionned on fixed randomness : @xmath22 and , by @xmath23 , its entropy , defined by @xmath24 .    for fixed randomness ,",
    "the real functions @xmath25and @xmath26 define the quenched average of the free energy per site and the annealed specific free energy respectively .    the ground state energy density @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28    for the low temperature region ( @xmath29 ) , the @xmath30-almost sure existence of the infinite volume limits @xmath31 and , @xmath32 was first proved by guerra and toninelli @xcite .",
    "more recently , aizenman , sims and starr @xcite gave a clear mathematical interpretation of the limit @xmath33 in terms of the variational formula proposed by parisi .",
    "in the following section we prove the + * theorem  :* _ let @xmath34 almost surely , the infinite volume limit @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 _    a directly related result is the following corollary , which improves all the rigorous lower bounds for the ground state energy .",
