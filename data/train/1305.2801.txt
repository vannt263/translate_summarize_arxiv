    "sampling at a high frequency with a high number of bits allows a sizable contiguous block of frequencies to be reproduced with high fidelity , but also has the drawback of requiring a large amount of adc power @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bandwidth and @xmath2 is the number of bits @xcite , @xcite .",
    "considering the analog signal in more detail , there are cases where the signal resides within a contiguous band of frequencies but within those frequencies the information content of the signal is non constant . as an example , consider a multicarrier wireline or wireless communication system with bit loading where large constellation sizes are used in high snr regions and small constellation sizes are used in low snr regions ( fig .",
    "[ figuresignalsnr ] ) .",
    "traditionally , an adc for this type of system would be designed with a number of bits capable of supporting the largest constellation size across the entire band . however",
    ", this is power inefficient in the low snr regions as many more bits are resolvable than the information content of the signal . likewise , the impact of the quantization noise is a nonuniform degradation of the received signal snr , as an equivalent amount of quantization noise added to a high snr region results in a larger degradation of snr than if it was added to a low snr region .    to address this ,",
    "various adcs have been proposed which allow for shaping the adc quantization noise and thus the bits vs.  frequency profile of the adc .",
    "for example , multi channel adcs in the literature have shown how shaping can be done via changing the constant bits vs.  frequency profile for delta sigma adcs on a per channel basis @xcite , projecting the received signal on a basis optimized for the signal before conversion @xcite , @xcite and by allocating more adcs to bands where the signal has a higher variance @xcite .",
    "efficient shaping for these cases relies on having a sufficiently large number of adcs such that the snr of the received signal does not change significantly within the band converted by the 1 of the individual constant bit vs.  frequency adcs which comprise the multi channel adc structure .",
    "compressive sensing adcs provide an implicit example of bits vs.  frequency shaping for cases when the input signal is sparse in frequency and the sampling rate is proportional to the occupied signal bandwidth rather than the total system bandwidth @xcite . ignoring noise folding issues which arise when unwanted signals are also present , this can be viewed as an on / off shaping of the quantization noise where 0 bits are assigned to frequencies where there is no signal and a constant number of bits are assigned to frequencies where there is a signal . as in the multi channel case",
    ", this can be viewed as block constant frequency shaping .",
    "given the existence of signals with information content which varies with frequency and adcs which can be designed explicitly or implicitly for quantization noise shaping , the question arises as to what is the optimal quantization noise shape for an adc with a fixed power budget to maximize the information content in the converted signal .",
    "the key theoretical result in section [ sectioninformation ] is the derivation of an equation which answers this question and is independent of a specific adc architecture .",
    "section [ sectionsingle ] then connects this theory to a common adc design by showing that quantization noise shaping can be achieved through the design of the loop filter in a delta sigma adc .",
    "optimal quantization noise shaping is extended to time and frequency interleaved multi channel adc structures in section [ sectionmulti ] and conclusions are provided in section [ sectionconclusions ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to determine the adc quantization noise shape that maximizes the information in the signal after the adc . before the adc , when the signal and noise are uncorrelated and the noise is additive colored gaussian , the maximum information in a signal occupying frequencies @xmath3 to @xmath4 is @xmath5df \\label{eqinfobefore}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is frequency",

    "the quantization noise psd and number of bits are related by @xmath12 and the adc power and number of bits are related by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a proportionality constant that for convenience we can absorb in the definition of @xmath15 . using ( [ eqqnoise ] ) and ( [ eqpower ] ) the quantization noise psd and the adc power",
    "are related as @xmath16 the smaller the quantization noise , the larger the power of the adc .    to determine the optimal quantization noise psd shape which minimizes the information loss of the signal after the adc ( [ eqinfoloss ] ) given the power constraint ( [ eqpowerconstraint ] ) ,",
    "integrals are converted into riemann sums by dividing the band from @xmath3 to @xmath4 into @xmath17 subchannels of bandwidth @xmath18 indexed by @xmath19 and forming the lagrangian @xmath20=&\\frac{f_{b}-f_{a}}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^{k}\\log_{2}\\left[1+\\frac{s_{q}(k)}{s_{v}(k)}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\lambda\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^{k}s_{q}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(k)-\\frac{\\sqrt{12}p}{f_{b}-f_{a}}\\right),\\label{eqlagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a lagrange multiplier . as both the information loss",
