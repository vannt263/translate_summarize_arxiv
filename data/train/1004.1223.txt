    "several second generation gravitational wave detectors are under construction now ( advanced ligo  @xcite , advanced virgo , geo - hf  @xcite ) . in general , the sensitivity of these instruments will be limited at low and high frequencies by quantum noise , however , in a critical mid - band around 100 hz , the thermal noise of the test mass mirror coatings is a significant limit . a typical sensitivity curve for a second generation detector is shown in fig .  [ adligonoise ] .",
    "in light of this fact , the study of thermal noise in dielectric coatings is an active area of research in the gravitational wave community .",
    "the optical cavities at the heart of the length - sensing mechanism of gravitational wave interferometers use mirrors made with multilayer dielectric coatings to produce the high reflectivities that are required . for good performance ( low absorption ) at @xmath0 nm ( the operating wavelength of most gravitational wave detectors ) , the coatings are usually made of alternating layers of silica ( @xmath1 ) and tantala ( @xmath2 ) . in an elegantly conceived experiment that studied mechanical loss in these coatings , penn et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the primary source of mechanical dissipation in these coatings was in the tantala layers rather than in the silica layers or at the interfaces between layers .",
    "this result suggests two possible mechanisms for reducing the mechanical dissipation and , therefore , the in - band brownian noise  @xcite .",
    "first , one can alter the chemistry of the tantala to reduce its mechanical loss .",
    "this has been accomplished by doping the tantala with titania ( @xmath3 ) to good effect @xcite .",
    "second , one can modify the geometry of the coating to reduce the total amount of tantala while preserving the reflectivity of the coating .",
    "such a coating is referred to here as an `` optimized coating '' and is the subject of this paper .",
    "projected noise floor of advanced ligo  @xcite . as it stands , brownian noise in the test mass coatings will prevent the instrument from reaching the quantum limit.,width=307 ]    a standard high - reflectivity multilayer dielectric coating consists of alternating layers of high and low index of refraction materials where the thickness of each layer is @xmath4 the local wavelength of the light .",
    "this design requires the minimum number of layers to achieve a prescribed reflectance .",
    "it does not , however , yield the lowest thermal noise for a prescribed reflectance .",
    "if there is a difference in the mechanical loss of the high and low index materials then the overall coating dissipation can be reduced by decreasing the total amount of the high loss material .",
    "we have developed a systematic procedure for designing minimal - noise coatings featuring a prescribed reflectivity . we have manufactured mirrors based on such a design at the laboratoire des matriaux avancs and measured the broadband noise floor of the thermal noise interferometer ( tni ) at the california institute of technology with these mirrors installed .",
    "we then compared this to an earlier measurement of the noise floor of the tni when mirrors with standard quarter - wavelength ( qwl ) coatings manufactured at research electro - optics , inc .",
    "were in place .",
    "this paper summarizes the relevant theoretical background , and presents the results of these measurements .",
    "until 2002 @xcite , surface fluctuations of thermal origin in the mirrors of an optical cavity had never been directly observed . up to that point",
    "the small scale of the fluctuations meant that they were always below the level of other noise sources such as laser frequency noise , shot noise , etc .",
    "the tni is a test bed interferometer specifically designed to detect these surface fluctuations .",
    "it consists of a lightwave model 126 npro ( non - planar ring oscillator ) laser , a triangular mode cleaner cavity used to spatially filter and stabilize the frequency of the laser beam , and two high finesse test cavities where cavity length noise measurements are made .",
    "the key features of the tni design that enable resolution of thermal noise are a relatively high power laser of nearly 1 w , frequency stabilization by the mode cleaner by a factor of 1000 compared to the free - running laser frequency noise in the detection band , a relatively small beam radius of 164 @xmath5 m to amplify the effect of the surface fluctuations , short test cavities to reduce the laser frequency stabilization requirement , and two identical test cavities to permit common mode noise rejection .",

    "[ layout ] .",
    "all three optical cavities are under vacuum and every cavity mirror is suspended like a pendulum from a loop of steel wire to preserve its high mechanical q and to isolate it from external sources of noise .",
    "the pound - drever - hall technique  @xcite is used to keep the cavities locked on resonance . in the case of a test cavity ,",
    "a signal is generated proportional to the deviation from the cavity resonance and this signal is fed back , after suitable amplification and filtering , to electromagnetic actuators at the end mirror of the cavity to control the cavity length .",
    "a block diagram of a test cavity servo is shown in fig .  [ servodiagram ] .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that a fluctuation measured at the readout point , @xmath6 , can be converted to its equivalent fluctuation in cavity length , @xmath7 , with the following formula , in the spectral ( frequency ) domain :    @xmath8    it is imperative that the ( spectral ) transfer functions of the servo elements @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are known accurately so that this conversion is valid .",

    "the frequency range where thermal noise is dominant can be greatly extended if common mode rejection is implemented between the two test cavities .",
    "this is done by using a commercial pre - amplifier ( stanford research systems sr560 ) to subtract the readout signal of one test cavity from the other as shown in fig .",
    "[ difservo ] . if the two test cavity servos are well matched , the difference between the readout signals , @xmath14 , is related to the difference between the cavity length fluctuations in the following manner : @xmath15 @xmath16 we refer to the two test cavities as the `` north '' and `` south '' cavities and the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 reflect this . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the transfer functions given by eq .",

    "once the common mode noise is removed from the tni by subtracting the test cavity readouts from each other , the noise floor of the instrument above about 20 khz becomes dominated by shot noise . for each test cavity ,",
    "the magnitude of the shot noise is determined by the power incident on the cavity s photodetector .",
    "this is light that is reflected from the test cavity and it consists primarily of the component of the test cavity input beam that is not mode - matched to the cavity ( the mode - matched component is transmitted through the cavity when it is resonant ) .",
    "the power depends on how well the cavities are aligned with their input beams and this can vary between measurements .",
    "the shot noise as a function of power on the photodetectors has been measured using a heat lamp as a shot noise limited source of radiation . accordingly , determining the magnitude of shot noise at the time a thermal noise measurement is made is simply a matter of noting the power on the photodetectors at that time and using the results from the heat lamp measurement .",
    "designing an optimized coating is a matter of finding the configuration of layer thicknesses that minimizes the brownian noise of the coating as a whole for a prescribed reflectance .",
