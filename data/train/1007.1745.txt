    "molecular motors are biogenic force generators acting in the nanometer range , and converting chemical energy into mechanical work @xcite , which play essential roles in eukaryotic cells @xcite . in the super family of molecular motors",
    "@xcite , the most extensively studied ones are conventional kinesin @xcite , cytoplasmic dynein @xcite , myosin v @xcite , and @xmath0atpase @xcite",
    ". the conventional kinesin can walk hand - over - hand along microtubule about 1 @xmath1 m to the plus end direction of the microtubule before its dissociation from the track @xcite , with step size 8.2 nm @xcite and stall force 6@xmath28 pn @xcite , which is independent of atp concentration @xcite . in saturating atp solution ,",
    "its zero load velocity is about 700@xmath21000 nm / s @xcite .",
    "cytoplasmic dynein also can walk hand - over - hand along microtubule with average step size 8.2 nm @xcite , but to the minus end direction @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data indicate that its stall force is also about 6@xmath28 pn @xcite , and independent of atp concentration @xcite . to the dynein which is purified from mammalian animals ,",
    "its maximal velocity is also about 700@xmath21000 nm / s @xcite .",
    "myosin v is also a processive motor but walks along actin filaments with average step size 36 nm , and atp independent stall force 2@xmath23 pn @xcite .",
    "atpase consists of two portions @xmath3 and @xmath4 connected to a @xmath5 shaft .",
    "it can use the proton - motive force across the mitochondrial membranes to make atp from adp and pi , and also can use atp to drive the rotation of the @xmath5 shaft @xcite .",
    "recent experiments found that there are also many other molecular motors that can move processively , such as kinesin cenp - e @xcite , myosin vi @xcite , myosin viia @xcite , myosin ixb @xcite , myosin xi @xcite , and t7 dna helicase @xcite .",
    "there are many mathematical models to describe the motion of molecular motor , such as fokker - planck equation @xcite , langevin equation @xcite , and master equation @xcite .",
    "however , so far , almost all of the explicit formulations of biophysical properties of molecular motor , such as mean velocity @xcite , effective diffusion constant @xcite , and mean first passage time @xcite , are obtained by employing one - sate models , in which the molecular motor moves along its track in one tilted periodic potential .",
    "one of the basic properties of such models is that the mean velocity of molecular motor does not vanish as long as the input energy is positive .",
    "these models and their corresponding results are valuable to describe the _ tightly _ mechanochemical coupled cases of motor motion .",
    "however , recent experimental data indicate the motion of molecular motors , including conventional kinesin @xcite , cytoplasmic dynein @xcite , myosin ii @xcite , and @xmath6-atpase @xcite are usually _ loosely _ coupled to atp hydrolysis , i.e. , the input energy might be nonzero even if the mean velocity vanishes . to study these loosely coupled cases , it is necessary to use multi - state models .",
    "in fact , the multi - state models have been used by some authors @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to get meaningful explicit results for the general @xmath7-state models .",
    "usually the numerical calculations are employed @xcite .    in this paper , we will give a detailed theoretical analysis to the two - state models .",
    "actually , the two - state models have most of the essential properties of the general multi - state models , and they have been used in many studies @xcite .",
    "there are two different forms of two - state models : ( 1 ) two coupled one - dimensional hopping models , and ( 2 ) two coupled one - dimensional fokker - planck equations , which is equivalent to two coupled langevin equations ( in fact , it also can be verified that , any one - dimensional hopping model can be well approximated by a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation @xcite ) . in the following , we will give the explicit formulation of the mean velocity of molecular motor by using two coupled one - dimensional hopping models and two coupled one - dimensional fokker - plank equations respectively .",
    "from this formulation , the _ stall force _ , i.e. , the external load under which the mean velocity vanishes , can be obtained .",
    "we find that , the mean velocity , and consequently the stall force depend not only on potentials in the two states ( or corresponding forward and backward transition rates ) , but also on transition rates between the two chemical states . in general , part of the input energy will dissipate into the environment , and so the _ energy efficiency _ , i.e. , the ratio of mechanical work done by the molecular motor to the input energy , might be far less than 1 .",
    "for example , the mean velocity might be zero even if the input energy in each state is nonzero .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the two coupled one - dimensional hopping models are discussed , and then in section * iii * , the two coupled fokker - planck equations are analyzed . in each models , three special cases are further analyzed : ( 1 ) the motor can jump between the two chemical states at only one position . in fact , the properties of this special case are much similar as the usual one state model . at steady state , there is no energy input to the molecular motor during its transition between the two chemical states .",
    "( 2 ) the motor can jump between the two states at two positions .",
    "this special case has the typical properties of the general cases .",
    "( 3 ) one of the two potentials is constant , or all the corresponding transition rates ( forward and backward ) are equal to each other in one of the two states .",
    "this special case corresponds to the flashing ratchet model of molecular motors .",
    "finally , the results are briefly summarized in section * iv*.",
    "the two coupled one - dimensional hopping models are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "in which , the forward and backward transition rates in state 1 are denoted by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , the forward and backward transition rates in state 2 are denoted by @xmath12 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath11 ) , and the transition rates between the two states at position @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 ( state 1 @xmath16 state 2 ) and @xmath17 ( state 2 @xmath16 state 1 ) . under the assumption of periodicity , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an integer number @xmath19 , @xmath7 is the period of hopping models .",
