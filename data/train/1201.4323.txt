    "this is mostly due to a penetration of the dirac cone states into subsurface layers ( fig . [",

    "@xcite for bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",

    "the discrepancy in the in - plane spin polarization between calculation ( @xmath53 % ) and experiment ( @xmath54 % ) at @xmath43@xmath42 can be traced back to the finite angular resolution of the spinarpes experiment .",
    "deconvolution from the bvb reveals an estimated spin polarization for the lower dirac cone of 80 - 90 % in experiment ( see appendix ) , which is in a good agreement with the dft result .",
    "next , we demonstrate that sb@xmath0te@xmath1 exhibits an additional spin split surface state originating from so interactions . figure  [ figure5](a ) shows arpes data along @xmath6 recorded at lower photon energy , @xmath55ev , and superimposed by the dft band structure of the rashba - type band .",
    "based on the excellent concurrence , we conclude that the arpes data at @xmath55 ev are dominated by these bands , while the dirac cone is barely visible .",
    "we determine the spin splitting of the rashba bands using spin - resolved edcs for the spin direction perpendicular to @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5](b ) .",
    "therefore , we fit the peak in each curve by a lorentzian function as shown by solid lines .",
    "this leads to the spin splitting energies @xmath56 indicated and plotted for different @xmath44 in fig . [",
    "figure5](c ) .",
    "reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental @xmath56 is found . moreover , as expected for a rashba - type spin splitting , the spin direction for upper and lower peak inverts by inverting the @xmath44 direction .",
    "we checked that negligible spin polarization is found parallel to @xmath44 which implies that the spin of the upper ( lower ) band rotates clockwise ( counter - clockwise ) with respect to @xmath44 in agreement with the dft results .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , dft further reveals that the rashba state shows no pronounced out - of - plane polarization within the first two atomic layers whereas in the in - plane direction , the different spin branches are nearly fully spin polarized . from @xmath57@xmath42",
    "to @xmath58@xmath42 the lower spin branch shows a slightly lower in - plane polarization than the upper spin branch .",
    "this is probably due to the proximity to the bulk band .",
    "altough there is a small reduction of the polarization , the coupling to the bulk band seems to be rather low .",
    "otherwise , the reduction should be more pronounced .",
    "compared to the dft , the experimental spin resolved data reveal a net spin polarization of @xmath59 % for the upper band and @xmath60 % for the lower band ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "most likely , the overlap of the two bands in the experiment as well as its overlap with the bulk bands caused by the limited energy and momentum resolution of the spin detector is responsible for the small numbers .",
    "the fact that the peak at higher energy is sharper is probably related to its larger separation from the bulk bands [ as visible in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) ] leading to longer lifetime .",
    "the charge density of the rashba - type state , as shown for @xmath43@xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ figure5](d ) reveals that it has predominantly te @xmath61 character and is localized strongly within the te surface layer .",
    "in contrast , the states of the dirac cone are more sb @xmath61 like and are penetrating more strongly into the bulk of sb@xmath0te@xmath1",
    ". the different penetration might be the reason why the dirac cone is more easily observed at higher photon energy , while the rashba state dominates the spectra at @xmath55 ev .",
    "the electric field between the surface te - layer and the subsurface sb - layer is deduced from the calculated surface core level shift to be about @xmath62 v / m having a strong dipolar contribution between te@xmath63 and sb@xmath64 .",
    "this surface dipole is probably responsible for the relatively large rashba coefficient , similar to the findings in surface alloys @xcite and layered bulk compounds @xcite .",
    "differently from the rashba bands found so far @xcite , the dft calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) predict that the different spin branches disperse into different projected bulk continuum bands .",
    "thus , each spin branch connects the upper and the lower bulk band surrounding the gap by dispersing from @xmath65@xmath42 to @xmath66@xmath42 . at @xmath4 , the surface state is spin degenerate as requested by time reversal symmetry .",
    "figure  [ figure6](a ) shows the measured band structure close to the point where the rashba bands merge with the bulk bands according to dft .",
    "indeed , a band moving upwards and a band moving downwards are discernible up to about @xmath67 @xmath42 .",
    "[ figure6](c ) reveals that a spin splitting of about 81mev is still visible at @xmath68 @xmath42 ( in comparison to a spin splitting of 80mev in the dft ) , i.e. , close to the point where merging of surface bands and bulk bands is obtained in the calculation .",
    "the origin of this remarkable behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) , where the calculated bulk band structure with and without so interaction is shown . obviously the so interaction opens a gap between the projected bulk states originating from a band @xmath69 near the fermi level and a lower - lying @xmath70 band , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 marks the parity of the states at @xmath4 .",
    "the gap is found at @xmath73@xmath42 along the line @xmath74 of the bulk band structure ( @xmath6 in terms of surface brillouin zone ) .",
    "in such a so gap , according to a theoretical argument given by pendry and gurman @xcite , at least one surface state with two spin channels must exist .",
    "the requirement is that the gap is not located at a high symmetry point of the brillouin zone as in our case .",
    "thus , the observed rashba split surface state , which we experimentally resolve within the spin - orbit gap , is protected by this gap .",
    "similarly to the topologically protected dirac cone , it connects the lower and the upper bulk bands , which are inverted by so interaction .",
    "so far , there has been very little experimental proof of such a surface state within a so gap away from a high symmetry point .",
    "feder and sturm @xcite report of a spin - orbit generated gap along the symmetry line @xmath75 in w(001 ) by means of tight - binding calculation , in which a surface state is found experimentally @xcite .",

    "differently from these states , our observation reveals a _ spin - splitted _ surface state with topological character , which , moreover exists in parallel to a surface dirac cone in the fundamental gap .",

    "the surface state at the fermi level does not exist in this case , confirming the topological nature of this state .",
    "the rashba state becomes a spin degenerate state and merges for positive and negative momenta with the same bulk band .",
    "thus , it does not connect the upper and the lower bulk band , i.e. , it loses its protected character .",

    "a low defect density of the crystal allows to follow this state up to the dirac point .",

    "<S> dft obtains a spin polarization of the occupied dirac cone states of 80 - 90 % , which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data after careful background subtraction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe a strongly spin - orbit split surface band at lower energy . this state is found at @xmath3ev at the @xmath4-point , disperses upwards , and disappears at about @xmath5ev into two different bulk bands . </S>",
    "<S> along the @xmath6 direction , the band is located within a spin - orbit gap . according to an argument given by pendry and gurman in 1975 , </S>",
    "<S> such a gap must contain a surface state , if it is located away from the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the novel spin - split state is protected by symmetry , too . </S>"
