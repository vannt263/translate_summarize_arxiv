    "in the spectra of stars , the h@xmath0 line is a prominent marker both as an emission line and as an absorption feature .",
    "h@xmath0 surveys are generally seen as vehicles for identifying emission line nebulae and stars associated with , primarily , the early and late phases of stellar evolution . in the case of iphas ,",
    "the int / wfc photometric h@xmath0 survey of the northern galactic plane ( drew et al .",
    "2005 ) , the quality of the digital photometry in the 3 survey filters , @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , also allows the strong h@xmath0 absorption associated with a - type stars near or on the main sequence to be used as a tool to select these early - type objects easily and reliably .",
    "furthermore , the photometry is sufficient to provide estimates of reddenings and distances .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how this capability may be exploited . in so doing",
    ", we shall verify the method against two test cases , and present an example of this selection at work .",
    "we shall show that the selection of a stars from the iphas @xmath12 colour - colour plane yields mainly samples of a0-a5 dwarf candidates .",
    "these early - type dwarfs of intermediate mass are expected to remain near the main sequence for not much longer than @xmath3100 million years , and so will typically trace relatively young environments  which are a defining feature of the thin disk population of our galaxy .",
    "objects of this type selected via their maximal h@xmath0 absorption have been exploited before as probes of structure within the galactic plane : in a series of papers , s. mccuskey and collaborators identified them in objective prism data down to @xmath13 and then mapped their distribution ( see e.g. mccuskey & houk 1971 , mccuskey & lee 1976 ) .",
    "this technique can be picked up again and applied to the iphas database starting from a bright limit of @xmath14th magnitude , reaching down to @xmath320th . as iphas approaches completion , and its catalogue database is becoming public ( gonzalez - solares et al .",
    "2008 ) , the targeted selection of a stars can be applied to a range of problems across the northern galactic plane , ranging from focused studies of individual clusters to tracing large scale galactic disk structure .",
    "the main application considered here is of the more localised type  to the still enigmatic cyg  ob2 association : data from 21 iphas fields covering the sky in and around this massive ob association are presented and analysed .",
    "cyg  ob2 is the most impressive of the northern hemisphere s galactic ob associations .",
    "our aim is to use the a - star distribution to better define the extent and nature of this massive cluster .",
    "this example also serves to show that even very young regions ",
    "13  myrs old in this case ( hanson 2003 )  can be usefully explored by this means .",
    "cyg  ob2 ( vi cygni ) is home to the only known northern hemisphere o3 stars ( walborn et al .",
    "it was first recognised for the very massive cluster that it is by reddish , lawrence & pratt ( 1967 ) , who carried out the first extensive study of the region .",
    "they placed it at a distance of 2.1  kpc , based on the apparent magnitude of late b stars .",
    "they also defined its extent as a 29  pc @xmath15 17  pc ellipse centred on ra 20 32 30 dec + 41 30 00 ( j2000 ) , and placed its mass in the range 0.6 ",
    "2.7@xmath16  m@xmath9 .",
    "however now , mainly as the result of the work by massey & thompson ( 1991 ) , the main concentration of ob stars is recognised as lying just to the ne of the vi  cyg  no 8 trapezium located at ra 20 33 06 dec + 41 22 30 ( j2000 ) , at the nearer distance of 1.7  kpc ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this was not so clearly evident , to begin with , because of the substantial reddening of the main association : @xmath17 is typical for massey & thompsons s ( 1991 ) ob population .",
    "on the basis of 2mass nir photometry of the region , kndlseder ( 2000 ) argued that cyg  ob2 could be even more massive than reddish et al s ( 1967 ) estimate , perhaps reaching as much as @xmath18  m@xmath9 , and could contain as many as 2600@xmath19400 ob stars .",
    "this has since been challenged by hanson ( 2003 ) , who has also shown that recent recalibrations of ob star absolute magnitudes may require a further reduction of the distance to cyg  ob2 to @xmath31.4  kpc ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the next section presents the main features of iphas and the resultant database .",
    "then in section 3 , the iphas @xmath20 colour - colour plane is discussed from the perspective of the reliable selection of a stars from it , how they may be dereddened , and how this selection maps onto a mean absolute magnitude .",
    "we then present two test cases , in the form of the well - studied open clusters ngc 7510 and ngc 7790 , to show that the selection works as expected in recovering their known distances and reddenings .",
    "this prepares the way for the challenge of exploring the cyg  ob2 region in section 5 , in which the full impact of the early a star absolute magnitude sensitivity to age , at the youngest ages , is seen .",
    "we conclude with a comment on our findings and on further development and application of the a - star selection technique .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     because this age effect can be significant , we give in table  [ tab_mr ] some representative values for @xmath21 as a function of age that have been derived from the isochrones of siess et al .",

    ", it seems likely that the best guess for the general field in the galactic disk will be around or slightly fainter than the hipparcos value of @xmath22 , or @xmath21 of 1.5  1.6 . since the age - dependence has obvious and serious ramifications for using the selection of early - a dwarfs to analyse galactic disk sightlines , we begin with two control populations to see how well the method works .",
    "our guinea pigs are the two open clusters , ngc 7510 and ngc 7790 , aged 6 - 10 myrs ( piskunov et al .",
    "2004 ) and @xmath3100 myrs ( bragalia & tosi 2006 ) , respectively .    finally , it is worth recalling that binarity will also have some effect on the average absolute magnitude of a population of early a stars .",
    "we make no explicit correction for this here beyond favouring @xmath23 , since we estimate it amounts to a brightening of the mean in the region of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "the following considerations suggest this figure : roughly a half of all stars are binary systems ; the mass ratio distribution is not far from flat ( halbwachs et al 2003 ) ; hence only in 2030 % of all binaries is the combined magnitude likely to brighten by more than 0.5 ( see figure 1 in hurley & tout 1998 ) .",
    "the steps in the extraction are very simple .",
    "first , @xmath24 ( as a function of @xmath25 ) is used to select stars as candidate early - a dwarfs .",
    "once selected , the measured @xmath25 is converted to a reddening , which then allows the measured @xmath1 to be corrected to a dereddened magnitude .",
    "there is no redundancy in our selection of candidate objects from iphas : we use 3 independent quantities to determine 3 properties .",
    "hence it is helpful to bring in e.g. near - infrared photometry to provide an independent check on the selection . for this",
    ", we turn to 2mass @xmath26 magnitudes - where available . hence ,",
    "as we select objects below an early - a dwarf limit line , we also collect the 2mass @xmath26 magnitude along with the iphas magnitudes and check that the dereddened @xmath27 colour falls in the early a - dwarf range ( set generously to be @xmath28 for a0 - 5v , cf .",
    "kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "if the dereddened @xmath27 for any object falls outside this range , the object is dropped from consideration .",
    "this weeding eliminates between a few percent to 30 percent , depending on the field .",
    "if no 2mass @xmath26 magnitude is available or it is an upper limit only , we retain the candidate a - dwarf unverified , rather than throw it away . if we were not to do this , our sample size would be noticeably reduced ( by a further factor of up to 2030% in the worst cases , again depending on the field ",
    "it is greater where the reddening is lower ) .    in all cases ,",
    "the bright limit is set at @xmath29 in order to avoid objects that might be saturated in @xmath10  particularly in the reddened fields found in the cyg  ob2 region .",
    "the faint limit is set at a value appropriate to the sensitivity limit for the iphas field under consideration .",
    "whilst exploring this technique of a - dwarf selection , we treat the position of the cut line in the colour - colour diagram as a variable . in particular , we obtain samples of candidates for 4 positions of the cut line : for @xmath30 , 0.02 , 0.025 and 0.03 , where @xmath31 is the upward dispacement of the a0v reddening line given in equation 1 .",

    "6001 is the most populous with 49 stars , 6010 the least with 32 .",
    "this leaves just 125 objects to be shared among the remaining 14 fields in this magnitude range . in broad brush terms",
    ", we have roughly 200 a stars spread across an area about 1 degree across , distributed around ra 20h 32 m and dec @xmath7741 00 ( 2000 ) .",
    "the typical dereddened magnitude for this grouping is @xmath78 . to be sure of the distance to this structure",
    ", an age must be known .",
    "the assumption made for fig .",
    "[ fig_multi ] was consistent with an age of 5 myr , and placed this clustering at distance of 1.7  kpc ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "if the typical age can be allowed to be as low as 2  myr , then @xmath21 is required to be as bright as 0.0 , driving the distance up to an improbable 2.6  kpc ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "a further argument against this solution is that we are seeing evidence here that such young a star populations tend to be sparse  as illustrated by the low counts linked to both dr  21 in the ne and to the main central concentration of optically - detected ob stars  both likely to be only 13  myrs old .",
    "it is more plausible to consider ages greater than 5  myrs , rather than less .",
    "for example , an age of @xmath37  myrs imposes @xmath81 ( table  [ tab_mr ] ) which then points to a distance modulus close to the value of 10.8 , equivalent to a distance of 1.4  kpc , that was favoured by hanson 2003 based on revised ob - star calibrations .    accepting an age spread in and around cyg",
    "ob2 seems the best option .",
    "if there are very young a - type objects embedded among the ob stars , they are few in number and/or escaping selection by virtue of either modest h@xmath0 emission or high extinction ( @xmath82 ) . the larger numbers of a stars to the south of cyg ob2 centre give away the presence of the larger , somewhat older , main cluster . in effect",
    "cyg ob2 can be seen as a further example of cluster rejuvenation , but on a much grander scale than that already noted in the test case of ngc 7510 .",
    "what is unclear at the moment is whether the rejuvenation is on the ne periphery of the main cluster , or whether it is more centrally located within a cluster that extends as far north as field 5998 , which also exhibits an a - star density peak in the appropriate dereddened magnitude range ( fig .",
    "[ fig_multi ] ) .",
    "the less elegant solution at this point is to view the swathe of a stars to the south of the nominal centre of cyg ob2 as evidence of a distinct cluster , of unknown age and distance , unconnected with the known ob stars .    if we can associate @xmath3200 a0-a5 near main sequence stars with a 5 - 7  myr old southerly cluster , then the combination of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones for this age range and the kroupa ( 2001 ) flattening of the salpeter imf below 0.5  m@xmath9 would imply a total cluster mass in the region of 10,000 m@xmath9 , and an ob star count of around 200 .",
    "there are a number of respects in which this estimate is surely on the low side .",
    "first , a minor point is that the sky coverage is only 90 percent . but more important",
    "is the fact that the selection of a stars applied here has been fairly conservative in order to keep sample contamination minimal : had the cut line been raised to @xmath83 , the number of candidate a dwarfs in the region would nearly double .",
    "there is also clear evidence of sample incompleteness due to high and patchy reddening  a problem that appears more marked in the more southerly fields 6001 and 5976 with higher @xmath38 than near the ob star concentration . and",
    "finally , this accounting does not include the immediate environs of the ob stars in which fewer stars of early - a colour have yet appeared : applying the same approach as above for a star count of @xmath330 ( for e.g. field 6010 ) at the much younger age of @xmath32  myrs adds a further @xmath310,000  m@xmath9",
    ". a final proper accounting of the total mass in the region of 30,000 to 40,000 m@xmath9 would not be surprising .",
    "the reputation of cyg  ob2 as the outstanding visible northern ob association remains untarnished .",
    "however , the upper limit of the claim by kndlseder ( 2000 ) is difficult to sustain : if this region truly is home to over 2000 ob stars then this appraisal of the a star content has under - counted by an order of magnitude . at least in the core region of cyg ob2 where the reddening is less severe ,",
    "so large a discrepancy is unlikely .",
    "this study has had two goals .",
    "the first of these was to show how the iphas @xmath20 plane may be exploited in a very simple way to yield reliable samples of near main - sequence a0-a5 stars .",
    "such objects in the general field , selected as described here and validated by hipparcos data , will present themselves with a typical absolute magnitude @xmath21 of 1.5  1.6 .",
    "fortunately , for stellar ages of @xmath3 10  myrs or more there is little change in this absolute magnitude . for simple single - aged populations a magnitude spread of @xmath84 is to be expected .",
    "demonstrations of this selection at work have been provided by the examples of the open clusters ngc 7510 and ngc 7790 .",
    "the second aim has been to apply this a - star selection technique to the challenging example of cyg  ob2 .",
    "this spectacular northern cluster , immersed in the cygnus x region of the galactic plane , continues to be debated in the literature on account of its uncertain dimensions and distance .",
    "the new capability directly bestowed by iphas photometry ( unsupported , thus far , by spectroscopy ) is that of identifying the on - sky distribution of and reddenings of over 1000 a0-a5 stars towards , around , within , and beyond cyg ob2 .",
    "the result of this is a clear peak in a - star density , comprising @xmath3200 objects , roughly centred on ra 20h 32 m and dec @xmath7741 00 ( 2000 ) , some 20 arcmin south of the vi  cyg no.8 trapezium normally taken as the centre of cyg  ob2 .",
    "the most parsimonious interpretation of the results obtained is to treat the southern clustering of a stars and the already known ob star concentration as part of the same cluster , compatible with a distance of 1.4  kpc ( @xmath85 , hanson 2003 ) if the a stars are @xmath37  myr old , or with 1.7  kpc ( @xmath7 , massey & thompson 1991 ) if their typical age is @xmath35  myr .",
    "either solution requires some age contrast between the a stars ( 5 - 7 myrs old ) and the main group of ob stars ( 13 myrs old , hanson 2003 ) .",
    "this may amount to two main bursts of star formation , or to an indication of a substantial age spread ( cf . the case of the onc cluster discussed by palla et al .",
    "the presence of a range of ages may help to explain why cyg  ob2 is not associated with bright h  ii emission despite its very evident rich o star population . the massive cluster , r  136 in the large magellanic cloud exhibits similar behaviour in that its intermediate mass stars appear to be @xmath36  myrs old , as compared with 12  myrs for the most massive stars ( see massey 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , in cyg  ob2 itself , signs of non - coeval star formation have been noticed before ( massey & thompson 1991 , hanson 2003 ) .",
    "the mass linked to the newly - found a stars in the cluster is at least 10,000  m@xmath9 . as a cautionary note ,",
    "we point out that it remains possible ( if less attractive , see schneider et al 2006 ) that the main a - star clustering is at a different distance from the ob stars .",
    "there are two wider applications of this new technique for selecting a stars from iphas .",
    "first , it is a new tool for use in exploring the structure of the galactic thin disk",
    ". this will be especially incisive when applied to the less reddened outer galaxy .",
    "we have not discussed metallicity here , but it should not create much difficulty : on the one hand , the weak line - blanketing at red wavelengths implies that the @xmath25 colour of a stars will not be metallicity - sensitive , and , on the other , the evidence to date is that metallicities ( @xmath86 $ ] ) in the thin disk at large galactic radii are not greatly subsolar ( e.g. carraro et al 2007 , who find a mean @xmath86 $ ] of @xmath87 for @xmath88 between 12 and 21  kpc ) .",
    "second , a - star selection over large sky areas allows a broad census to be conducted of the early evolution of a stars by , for example , identifying the fraction with clear infrared excesses . a study of this kind has already been undertaken by hales et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who have combined iphas photometry with spitzer / glimpse and 2mass data .",
    "a work for the future is to generalise the a - star selection scheme to begin to extract a broader range of spectral types from the main stellar locus in the iphas colour - colour plane . in principle",
    "it is possible to map the positions of a - k near main - sequence stars as a function of reddening onto unique @xmath89 values  if an effective means to distnguish and separate out higher luminosity classes can be identified .",
    "an exploration of this opportunity is now underway ( sale et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we thank kerttu viironen who was the observer at the telescope the night the cyg  ob2 data were obtained .",
    "we also thank jorick vink , danny steeghs , danny lennon and jeremy drake for helpful comments relating to this work .",
    "the referee of this paper , philip massey , is thanked for his useful comments .",

    "the int is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
