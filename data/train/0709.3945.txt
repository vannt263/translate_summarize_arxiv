    "driven quantum systems are exceedingly more complicated to study than stationary systems , and only few such problems have been solved exactly .",
    "an important exception is the landau - zener transitions.@xcite in the conventional landau - zener problem , a two - level system is driven by changing an external parameter in such a way that the level separation @xmath13 is a linear function of time , @xmath14 .",
    "close to the crossing point of the two levels an inter - level tunneling matrix element @xmath15 lifts the degeneracy in an avoided level crossing . when the system is initially in the ground state the probability to find it in the excited state after the transition is @xmath16 .",
    "hence , fast rate drives the system to the excited state , while the system ends in ground state when driven slowly .",
    "the landau - zener formalism was originally developed for molecular and atomic physics , but has since then been applied to various systems and many generalizations of the linearly driven two - level system exists , like avoided level crossing of multiple levels,@xcite repeated crossings,@xcite non - linear model , @xcite and non - linear driving functions.@xcite    in connection with decoherence of qubits there has recently been increased interest in landau - zener transitions in systems coupled to an environment .",
    "this problem is both of theoretical interest and of practical importance for qubit experiments.@xcite the noise affects the qubit in two ways .",
    "first , it destroys coherence by random additions to the phase difference of the two states ( dephasing ) .",
    "second , it causes transitions and alters the level occupation ( relaxation ) .",
    "the noisy landau - zener problem has been discussed by several authors@xcite both for quantum and classical environments . in this work",
    "we will study classical noise processes .",
    "in particular , we will use a random telegraph process as the noise source .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of noise with long correlation time ( slow , or non - gaussian noise ) . in the limit of short correlation times",
    "we will recover the results of pokrovsky and sinitsyn@xcite who have considered this problem in the limit of fast noise .",
    "an important result of their analysis was that there is a characteristic time scale , @xmath17 , during which the noise is active .",
    "if this time scale is long compared to the time of the landau - zener transitions , @xmath18 , dynamics can be separated in a noise - dominated regime for long times and a pure , noiseless landau - zener transition for short times .",
    "this allows one to study separately transitions driven purely by noise and the usual landau - zener transitions driven by the tunneling amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "we will follow this approach , which simplifies the problem considerably .",
    "most works on noisy landau - zener transitions are mainly concerned with transition probabilities .",
    "however , in the case of an open system it is also interesting to study the amount of decoherence , or purity , of the state after the transition is passed . in terms of the bloch vector ,",
    "the transition probability is given by the @xmath19-component of the vector whereas the purity is given by its length . by generalization from the stationary case , it is clear that longitudinal noise ( noise in the level spacing @xmath13 ) will cause dephasing at all times , and the final state will always be on the axis of the bloch sphere , i.e. , the @xmath20- and @xmath21-components of the bloch vector decay to zero . for transverse noise ( noise in the anticrossing energy @xmath15 )",
    "the situation is less evident since the effect of the noise is reduced by the factor @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath13 increases sufficiently fast as function of time one can in a sense ` run away ' from the noise , and the final state will not decohere maximally .",
    "this motivates us to study the effect of nonlinear time dependences for the level splitting , similar to those considered in ref .   for landau - zener transitions without noise . in particular",
    ", we will study power - law driving functions , @xmath23 , and we will find that there exists a critical @xmath4 such that the system is completely decohered for @xmath7 even for arbitrarily weak noise coupling . for @xmath8 some coherence is retained .",
    "the critical @xmath4 will depend on the correlation time of the noise .",
    "consider a solid state qubit , e.g. , a josephson charge qubit.@xcite the qubit is modeled as a two - level system and it couples to environment through a randomly fluctuating addition @xmath24 on its off - diagonal terms .",
    "let us here only consider dynamics for one realization of @xmath24 , while in next section we will use the particular model of random telegraph noise to derive master equations for the noise averaged quantities .",

    "the interesting dynamics comes from a power - law time - dependency @xmath29 with sweep rate @xmath30 and exponent @xmath3 .",
    "linear sweep and no noise give exactly the landau - zener dynamics .",
    "however , our focus will be on entirely noise - driven transition for any exponent .    from here and throughout this work",
    "the quantum state is described by the bloch vector @xmath31 .",
    "the bloch vector is is given from the density matrix @xmath32 as @xmath33 for a pure quantum system the vector * r * is a unit vector . under the influence of noise",

    "the dynamics of * r * is given by the bloch equation , @xmath34 analogous to a spin precessing in magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "we use units where @xmath36 throughout this work .",
    "the noise model applied in this work is _ random telegraph noise_. such noise occurs when defects create bistable traps , atomic or electronic , in solids , and is assumed@xcite to be a basic source for various kinds of high and low - frequency noise.@xcite for example , a large number of fast fluctuators with a narrow distribution of switching rates give gaussian white noise .",
    "a broad distributions of switching rates can , on the contrary , give rise to non - gaussian , @xmath37 noise.@xcite in experiments on solid state qubits , the low - frequency @xmath37 noise is often the dominant source of decoherence.@xcite for tiny devices , a small number , or even single fluctuators , can be important .",

    "fluctuator _ , is more strongly coupled to its surroundings than to the qubit we can consider its dynamics to be independent of the qubit , and it will act as a classical noise source , driven by its environment . with this approximation , the effect of the fluctuator on the qubit appears through a randomly switching addition @xmath39 to the tunneling energy . the constant , @xmath0 , represents fluctuator - qubit coupling strength , which will be called noise strength for short .",
    "we assume the switchings between the two fluctuator states to be independent , random events .",
    "the rates of random switching is assumed to be the same between both fluctuator levels , @xmath40 .",
    "this holds when the fluctuator level - spacing is small compared to the temperature .",
