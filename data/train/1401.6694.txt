    "we consider the problem of determining the coefficients and exponents of an unknown sparse multivariate polynomial , given a `` black box '' procedure that allows for its evaluation at any chosen point .",

    "our randomized kronecker substitution is also a map from multivariate to univariate polynomials obtained by evaluating at powers of a single indeterminate .",
    "we choose @xmath1 integers @xmath10 at random and perform the substitution @xmath11 .",
    "when these integers are not too large ( in particular , if each @xmath12 ) , the degree of @xmath7 will be less than in the usual kronecker substitution .",
    "the price of a decreased degree is that the map is no longer invertible , for two reasons .",
    "first , we may have two or more distinct terms in @xmath0 converge to a single term in @xmath7 .",
    "this is called a _",
    "collision_. the second difficulty is that the original multivariate exponents can not be determined directly from the terms in a single substitution @xmath7 .",
    "we will show how performing @xmath13 such random substitutions can overcome both difficulties .    in the example",
    "above , choose @xmath14 and @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 in this case @xmath17 , so there were no term collisions , even though their order has changed .",
    "the advantage is that the degree is significantly less than that from the usual kronecker substitution .",
    "choosing instead @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the result is @xmath20 which again has a reduced degree , but in this case we have a _ collision _ : the two terms @xmath21 in @xmath0 collided to produce a single term @xmath22 under this substitution .",
    "nonetheless , for the two terms not involved in a collision , both images can be used to recover the original terms in @xmath0 .",

    "polynomial interpolation dates from the 18th century , where the goal was to discover a polynomial approximation to an unknown function by collecting sufficiently many observations .",
    "it is often beneficial to search for a _ sparse _ model , where only a bounded number of terms in the polynomial are nonzero ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our setting is more restrictive in two senses .",
    "first , we require the ability to choose the points at which the unknown polynomial is evaluated . in this _ black - box _ interpolation setting , the polynomial a procedure which can be probed with any desired input , at some cost ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also require that a sparse polynomial truly exists `` inside the box '' , and all evaluations  even those with numerical noise  come from the same @xmath31-sparse polynomial .",
    "this is different from the general setting above where the true function need not be @xmath31-sparse or indeed a polynomial at all .",
    "( allowing for outliers as in @xcite provides another option . )    algorithmic progress in sparse interpolation can be divided into two categories depending on the complexity .",
    "algorithms with polynomial dependence on the partial degree bounds , sparsity bound , and number of variables are called _ sparse _ algorithms @xcite .",
    "those with only logarithmic dependence on the degree are _ supersparse _ and can be useful even in the case of univariate polynomials @xcite .    as shown in the introduction , kronecker subtitution @xcite can turn a univariate interpolation into a multivariate one , by evaluating the multivariate polynomial at high powers of the univariate interpolation points .",
    "this is especially effective in conjunction with supersparse algorithms @xcite .",
    "zippel s sparse interpolation method proceeds one variable at a time and uses randomization to identify which portions of the unknown sparse polynomial vanish . this is another way to turn any univariate algorithm into a multivariate one @xcite .",
    "there is recent work on implementations of sparse interpolation @xcite and applications to gcd and factorization @xcite .",
    "the kronecker substitution in particular has been applied to integer and polynomial multiplication @xcite .",
    "sparse interpolation has a strong connection to the important theoretical problem of polynomial identity testing ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",

    "there are @xmath336 such exponents , each with @xmath337 bits , for a total bit cost of @xmath338 .    for given bounds @xmath339 and an unknown polynomial",

    "the analysis of the first two parts is the same as in the bivariate case .    for the bit complexity",
    ", we do not have to worry about primality testing here .",

    "the @xmath297 case has in addition the probabilistic step ( 3 ) of guaranteeing that we can construct a full - rank linear system in order to solve for every exponent of @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of failure in each of these steps has been controlled above so that the overall success probability is at least @xmath292 .",
    "if a higher success probability , say @xmath241 , is desired , we simply run the interpolation algorithm described in sections [ sec : fam - subs][sec : lin - sys ] with some @xmath349 times . again using hoeffding s inequality , the probability that the algorithm fails at least @xmath350 times is at most @xmath351 .",

    "such an @xmath0 exists and is in fact the correct answer .",
    "we have presented a new randomization that maps a multivariate polynomial to a univariate polynomial with ( mostly ) the same terms .",
    "this improves on the usual kronecker map by reducing the degree of the univariate image when the polynomial is known to be sparse .",
    "we have also shown how a small number of such images can be combined to recover the original terms of the unknown multivariate polynomial .",
    "there are numerous questions raised by this result .",
    "perhaps foremost is whether there is any practical gain in any particular application by using this approach .",
    "we know that the randomized kronecker substitution will result in smaller degrees than the usual kronecker substitution whenever the polynomial is sufficiently large and sufficiently sparse , so in principle the applications should include any of the numerous results on sparse polynomials that use a kronecker substitution to accommodate multivariate polynomials .    unfortunately , in practice , the situation is not so clear .",
    "many of the aforementioned results that rely on a kronecker substitution either do not have a widely - available implementation , or do not usually involve sparse polynomials .",
    "however , for the particular applications of sparse gcd and sparse multivariate multiplication , there is considerable promise particularly in the case of bivariate polynomials with degree greater than 1000 or so and sparsity between @xmath2 and @xmath353 .",
    "an efficient implementation comparison in these situations would be useful and interesting , and we are working in that direction .",
    "there are also questions of theoretical interest . for one ,",
    "we would like to know how far off the bounds on the size of primes from lemmata [ lem : lambda - pq ] and [ lem : lambda ] are compared to what is really necessary to avoid collisions .",
    "an important question is whether our current results are optimal in any sense . in the bivariate case , when @xmath354 our result gives @xmath355 , which is optimal in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "that is because @xmath31 could be as large as @xmath356 , and therefore any monomial substitution exponent less than @xmath357 would by necessity have more than a constant fraction of collisions .",
    "however our result for @xmath185 gives each @xmath358 , which in terms of @xmath31 is off by a factor of @xmath359 from the optimal .",
    "it may be possible to improve these bounds simply with a better analysis , or with a different kind of randomized monomial substitution . in either case , it is clear that , at least for @xmath297 and in particular for @xmath360 , it should be possible to improve on the results here and achieve univariate reduced polynomials with even lower degree .    another interesting question would be whether some of this randomization can be avoided .",
    "here we have two randomizations , the diversification and the ( multiple ) randomized kronecker substitutions . and",
    "this is besides any randomization that might occur in the underlying univariate algorithm !",
    "it seems plausible that , for example in the application of multivariate multiplication , the known aspects of the monomial structure might be used to make some choices less random and more `` intelligent '' .",
    "however , we do not yet know any reasonable way to accomplish this .",
