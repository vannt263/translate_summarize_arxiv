    "the idea of building ultracryogenic spherical gravitational wave ( gw ) antennae seems to be progressively winning adepts , even despite the technological difficulties of various kinds posed by a project like that , which every expert acknowledges .",
    "confidence in its feasibility stems from many years of experience : groups at stanford , louisiana state university , roma and legnaro ( italy ) and perth ( western australia ) have constructed and operated , at different levels , cryogenic cylindrical bars of the weber type @xcite . in particular , a _ long term _ strain sensitivity @xmath0 for millisecond bursts has been reported from the bar _ explorer _ @xcite .",
    "the new generation ultracryogenic cylinder _",
    "nautilus _ , of the frascati group @xcite , is beginning operation as these lines are written @xcite , with an expected sensitivity nearly an order of magnitude better than the above .",
    "spherical antennae are considered by many to be the natural next step in the development of resonant gw detectors @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this new trend essentially derive from the _ improved sensitivity _ of a sphere which can be nearly an order of magnitude better than a clyinder having the same resonance frequency , see below and @xcite , and from its _ multimode capabilities _ ,",
    "first recognised by forward @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite .",
    "although some of the most relevant aspects of detector sensitivity have already received attention in the literature , it seems to me that a sufficiently general and flexible analysis of the interaction detector - gw has not been satisfactorily developed to date .",
    "this _ theoretical _ shortage has a number of _ practical _ negative consequences , too . traditional analysis , to mention but an example , is almost invariably restricted to general relativity or scalar  tensor theories of gravity ; while it may be argued that this is already very general , any such argument is , as a matter of fact , understating the potentialities actually offered by a spherical gw antenna to help decide for or against any one specific theory of the gravitational field on the basis of _ experimental observation_.    i thus propose to develop in this paper a full fledged mathematical formalism which will enable analysis of the antenna s response to a completely general gw , i.e. , making no _ a priori _ assumptions about which is the correct theory underlying gw physics ( other than , indeed , that it is a _",
    "theory ) , _ and _ also making no assumptions about detector shape , structure or boundary conditions . considering things in such generality",
    "is not only `` theoretically nice '' it also brings about new results and a _",
    "better understanding _ of older ones .",
    "for example , it will be proved that the sphere is the _ most efficient _ gw elastic detector shape , and that higher mode absorption cross sections _",
    "scale independently of gw physics_. i will also discuss the direction of incidence deconvolution problem in the context of a general metric theory of gravity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section 2 is devoted to the development of the general mathematical framework , leading to a formula in which an elastic solid s response is related to the action of an arbitrary metric gw impinging on it . in section 3",
    "the general equations are applied to the homogeneous spherical body , and a discussion of the _ deconvolution _ problem is presented as well .",
    "section 4 contains the description of the sphere s sensitivity parameters , specifically leading to the concept of _ multimode , _ or vector , _ transfer function _ , and to an analysis of the _ absorption cross section _ presented by this detector to a passing by gw .",
    "conclusions and prospects are summarised in section 5 , and two appendices are added which include mathematical derivations .",
    "in the mathematical model , i shall be assuming that the antenna is a solid elastic body which responds to gw perturbations according to the equations of classical non - relativistic linear elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "this is fully justified since , as stressed above , gw induced displacements will be very small indeed , and the speed of such displacements much smaller than that of light for any forseeable frequencies . although our primary interest is a spherical antenna , the considerations which follow in the remainder of this section _ have general validity for arbitrarily shaped isotropic elastic solids_.    let @xmath1 be the displacement vector of the infinitesimal mass element sitting at point * x * relative to the solid s centre of mass in its unperturbed state , whose density distribution in that state is @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the material s elastic lam coefficients .",
    "if a volume force density @xmath5 acts on such solid , the displacement field @xmath1 is the solution to the system of partial differential equations @xcite    @xmath6    with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions .",
    "a summary of notation and general results regarding the solution to that system is briefly outlined in the ensuing subsection , as they are necessary for the subsequent developments in this paper , and also in future work .      for reasons which will become clear later on",
    ", we shall only be interested in driving forces of the separable type    @xmath7    or , indeed , linear combinations thereof . the solution to ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    "does not require us to specify the precise boundary conditions on @xmath1 at this stage , but we need to set the initial conditions .",
    "we adopt the following :    @xmath8    where  @xmath9 , implying that the antenna is at complete rest before observation begins at @xmath10=0 .",
    "the structure of the force field ( [ 2.2 ] ) is such that the displacements @xmath1 can be expressed by means of a _ green function _ integral of the form    @xmath11    the deductive procedure whereby @xmath12 is calculated can be found in many standard textbooks see",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the result is    @xmath13      \\sum_n\\,\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{f_n}{\\omega_n}$}\\ ,      { \\bf u}_n({\\bf x})\\sin\\omega_nt      & \\ \\ { \\rm if}\\ \\ t\\geq 0 \\end{array}\\right .",

    "solutions _ to    @xmath16    with suitable _",
    "boundary conditions_. here @xmath17 represents an index , or set of indices , labelling the _ eigenmode _ of frequency  @xmath18 .",
    "the normalisation condition is ( arbitrarily ) chosen so that    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the total mass of the solid , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "replacing now ( [ 2.15 ] ) into ( [ 2.6 ] ) we can write the solution to our problem as a series expansion :    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) is the _ formal _ solution to our problem ; it has the standard form of an orthogonal expansion and is valid for _ any _ solid driven by a separable force like ( [ 2.2 ] ) and _ any _ boundary conditions .",
    "it is therefore _",
    "completely general _ , given that type of force .",
    "before we go on , it is perhaps interesting to quote a simple but useful example",
    ". it is the case of a solid hit by a _ hammer blow _ ,",
    "i.e. , receiving a sudden stroke at a point on its surface . exam of the response of a gw antenna to such perturbation is being used for correct tuning and monitoring of the device @xcite .",
    "if the driving force density is represented by the simple model    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the surface point hit , and @xmath25 is a constant vector , then the system s response is immediately seen to be    @xmath26    with @xmath27 .",
    "a hammer blow thus excites _ all _ the solid s normal modes , except those _ perpendicular _ to @xmath25 , with amplitudes which are _ inversely proportional to the mode s",
    "frequency_. this is seen to be a rather general result in the theory of sound waves in isotropic elastic solids .",
    "an incoming gw manifests itself as a _ tidal _ force density ; in the long wavelength linear approximation @xcite it only depends on the `` electric '' components of the riemann tensor :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the speed of light , and sum over the repeated index _",
    "j _ is understood . in ( [ 3.1 ] ) tidal forces are referred to the antenna s centre of mass , and thus * x * is a vector originating there .",
    "note that i have omitted any dependence of @xmath30 on spatial coordinates , since it only needs to be evaluated at the solid s centre .",
    "the riemann tensor is only required to first order at this stage @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the perturbations to flat geometry ) will run through space - time values 0,1,2,3 ; _ latin _ indices ( @xmath33 ) will run through space values 1,2,3 only .",
    "] , always at the centre of mass of the detector .",
    "the form ( [ 3.1 ] ) is seen to be a sum of three terms like ( [ 2.2 ] ) but this three term `` straightforward '' splitting is not the most convenient , due to lack of invariance and symmetry . a better choice is now outlined .",
    "an _ arbitrary symmetric _",
    "tensor @xmath34 admits the following decomposition :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 are 5 linearly independent _ symmetric _ and _ traceless _ tensors , and @xmath37 is a multiple of the _ unit _ @xmath38 and @xmath39 are uniquely defined functions , whose explicit form depends on the particular representation of the chosen .",
    "a convenient one is the following :    [ 3.4 ] @xmath40    & e_{ij}^{(0 ) } = \\left(\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{5}{16\\pi}$ }                   \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }        -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{array}\\right)\\ , \\ \\",

    "such features are characterised by the relations    @xmath41    where * n*@xmath42*x*/@xmath43 is the radial unit vector , and @xmath44 are spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "details about the above @xmath45-matrices are given in appendix a. in particular , the orthogonality relations ( [ a.9 ] ) can be used to invert ( [ 3.3 ] ) :    [ 3.77 ] @xmath46     { \\cal s}^{(m)}(t ) & = & \\frac{8\\pi}{15}\\,e_{ij}^{*(m)}\\,{\\cal s}_{ij}(t )                       \\ , \\qquad m=-2,\\ldots,2     \\label{3.77b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where an asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",

    "metric _ theory of the gravitational interaction .",
    "it is also valid for _ any antenna shape _ and _ any boundary conditions _",
    ", thus giving the formalism , in particular , the capability of being used to study the response of a detector which is _ suspended _ by means of a mechanical device in the laboratory site a situation of much practical importance .",
    "it is therefore _ very _ general",
    ".    equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) also tells us that that only _ monopole _ and _ quadrupole detector modes _ can possibly be excited by a metric gw .",
    "the nice thing about ( [ 3.9 ] ) is that it _",
    "fully _ displays the monopole - quadrupole _ structure _ of the solution to our fundamental differential equations .    in a non - symmetric body ,",
    "all ( or _ nearly _ all ) the modes have monopole and quadrupole moments , and ( [ 3.9 ] ) precisely shows how much each of them contributes to the detector s response .",
    "homogeneous spherical _ antenna , which is very symmetric , has a set of vibrational eigenmodes which are particularly well matched to the form ( [ 3.9 ] ) : it only possesses _ one _ series of monopole modes and _ one _ ( five - fold degenerate ) series of quadrupole modes see next section and appendix b for details .",
    "the existence of so _ few _ modes which couple to gws means that _ all the absorbed incoming radiation energy will be distributed amongst those few modes only _ , thereby making the sphere the _ most efficient _ detector , even from the sensitivity point of view .",
    "the higher energy cross section _ per unit mass _ reported for spheres on the basis of for example , finds here its qualitative explanation .",
    "the generality of ( [ 3.9 ] ) , on the other hand , means that _ this excellence of the spherical detector is there independently of which is the correct gw theory_.    before going further , let me mention another potentially useful application of the formalism so far .",
    "cylindrical antennas , for instance , are usually studied in the _ thin rod _ approximation ; although this is generally quite satisfactory , equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) offers the possibility of eventually considering corrections to such simplifying hypothesis by use of more realistic eigenfunctions , such as those given in @xcite .",
    "recent new proposals for stumpy cylinder arrays @xcite may well benefit from the above approach , too .",
    "to explore the consequences of ( [ 3.9 ] ) in a particular case , the mode amplitudes @xmath15 and frequencies @xmath52 must be specified . from now on i will focus on a _ homogeneous sphere _ whose surface is free of tractions and/or tensions ; the latter happens to be quite a good approximation , even if the sphere is suspended in the static gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the normal modes of the free sphere fall into two families : so called _ toroidal _ where the sphere only undergoes twistings which keep its shape unchanged throughout the volume and _ spheroidal _",
    "@xcite , where radial as well as tangential displacements take place .",
    "i use the notation    @xmath53    for them , respectively ; note that the index @xmath17 of the previous section is a _ multiple _",
    "index @xmath54 for _ each _ family ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the usual _ multipole _ indices , and @xmath57 numbers from 1 to @xmath58 each of the @xmath55-pole modes .",
    "the frequencies happen to be independent of @xmath59 , and so every one mode ( [ 3.10 ] ) is ( 2@xmath55 + 1)-fold degenerate .",
    "further details about these eigenmodes are given in appendix b.    in order to see what ( [ 3.9 ] ) looks like in this case , integrals of the form ( [ 2.14 ] ) ought to be evaluated .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that they all vanish for the toroidal modes , the spheroidal modes contributing the only non - vanishing terms ; after some algebra one finds    [ 3.11 ] @xmath60    f_{nlm}^{(m ' ) } & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{m}\\,\\int_{\\rm sphere }    { \\bf u}_{nlm}^{p\\,*}({\\bf x})\\cdot{\\bf f}^{(m')}({\\bf x})\\,d^3x =     b_n\\,\\delta_{l2}\\,\\delta_{m'm }    \\label{3.11b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    [ 3.12 ] @xmath61    b_n & = & -\\frac{1}{m}\\,\\int_0^r \\left[a_{n2}(r ) +    3\\,b_{n2}(r)\\right]\\,\\rho\\,r^3\\,dr          \\label{3.12b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath62 , @xmath63 are given in appendix b , and @xmath64 is the sphere s radius . to our reassurance , only the monopole and quadrupole _ sphere modes _ survive , as seen by the presence of the factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 in ( [ 3.11a ] ) and ( [ 3.11b ] ) , respectively .",

    "if the measuring system were ( ideally ) sensitive to all frequencies , filters could be applied to examine the antenna s oscillations at each monopole and quadrupole frequency : a single transducer would suffice to reveal @xmath71 around the monopole frequencies @xmath77 , whilst _ five _ ( placed at suitable positions ) would be required to calculate the five degenerate amplitudes @xmath72 around the quadrupole frequencies @xmath78 . once the _ six _ functions @xmath79 would have thus been determined , inverse fourier transforms would give us the functions @xmath80 , and thereby the six riemann tensor components @xmath81 through inversion of the second equations ( [ 3.8 ] ) , i.e. , as an expansion like ( [ 3.3 ] ) only with @xmath82 s instead of @xmath83 s .",
    "deconvolution would then be complete .",
    "well , not quite ",
    "knowledge of the riemann tensor in the _ laboratory _ frame coordinates is not really sufficient to say the waveform has been completely deconvolved , unless we _ also _ know the _ source position _ in the sky .",
    "there clearly are two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the source position _ is _ known ahead of time by some other astronomical observation methods .",
    "let me rush to emphasise that , far from trivial or uninteresting , this is a _ very important _ case to consider , specially during the first stages of gw astronomy , when any reported gw event will have to be thoroughly checked by all possible means .",
    "+ if the incidence direction is known , then a rotation must be applied to the just obtained quantities @xmath81 , which takes the laboratory into coincidence with the incoming wave propagation vector . a classification procedure",
    "must thereafter be applied to the so transformed riemann tensor in order to see which is the theory ( or class of theories ) compatible with the actual observations .",
    "such classification procedure has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "+ the spherical antenna is thus seen to have the _ capability of furnishing the analyst sufficient information to discern amongst different competing theories of gw physics , whenever the wave incidence direction is known prior to detection_. 2 .",
    "the source position is _ not _ known at detection time .",
    "this makes things more complex , since the above rotation between the laboratory and gw frames can not be performed .",
    "+ in order to deconvolve the incidence direction in this case , a specific theory of the gws _ must _ be assumed a given choice being made on the basis of whatever prior information is available or , simply , dictated by the the decision to probe a particular theory .",
    "wagoner and paik @xcite propose a method which is useful both for gr and bd theory , their idea being simple and elegant at the same time : since neither of these theories predicts the excitation of the @xmath56=@xmath841 quadrupole modes _ of the wave _ , the source position is determined precisely by the rotation angles which , when applied to the laboratory axes , cause the amplitudes of those _ antenna _ modes to vanish ; the rotated frame is thereby associated to the gw natural frame . +",
    "a generalisation of this idea can conceivably be found on the basis of a detailed and possibly rather casuistic analysis of the canonical forms of of the riemann tensor for a list of theories of gravity , along the following line of argument : any one particular theory will be characterised by certain ( homogeneous ) canonical relationships amongst the monopole and quadrupole components of the riemann tensor , @xmath80 , and so enforcement of those relations upon rotation of the laboratory frame axes should enable determination of the rotation angles or , equivalently , of the incoming radiation incidence direction .",
    "scalar - tensor theories e.g. have @xmath85 in their canonical forms , hence wagoner and paik s proposal for this particular case . + before any deconvolution procedure is triggered off , however , it is very important to make sure that it will be _ viable_.",
    "more precisely , since the transformation from the laboratory to the ultimate canonical frame is going to be linear , _ invariants _ must be preserved .",
    "this means that , even if the source position is unknown , certain theories will forthrightly be _ vetoed _ by the observed @xmath81 if their predicted invariants are incompatible with the observed ones . to give but an easy example , if @xmath81 is _ observed _ to have a non - null trace @xmath86 , then a veto on gr",
    "will be readily served , and therefore no algorithm based on that theory should be applied .",
    "+ i would like to make a final remark here .",
    "assume a direction deconvolution procedure has been successfully carried through to the end on the basis of certain gw theory , so that the analyst comes up with a pair of numbers @xmath87 expressing the source s coordinates in the sky .",
    "of course , these numbers will represent the _ actual _ source position _ only if the assumed theory is correct_. now , how do we know it _ is _ correct ? strictly speaking , `` correctness '' of a scientific theory is an",
    "_ asymptotic _",
    "concept in the sense that the possibility always remains open that new facts be eventually discovered which contradict the theory , and so _ reliability _ of the estimate @xmath87 of the source position can only be assessed in practice in terms of the _ consistency _ between the assumed theory and whatever experimental evidence is available _ to date _ , including , indeed , gw measurements themselves .",
    "it is thus very important to have a method to verify that the estimate @xmath87 does not contradict the theory which enabled its very determination .",
    "+ such verification is a _ logical _ absurdity if only _",
    "one _ measurement of position is available ; this happens for instance if the recorded signal is a _ short burst _ of radiation , and so _ two antennas _ are at least necessary to check consistency in that case",
    ". the test would proceed as a check that the time delay between reception of the signal at both detectors is consistent with the calculated @xmath87 , even if the assumed theory is wrong , since the sphere deformations will be the same if caused by the same signal .",
    "] , given their relative position and the wave propagation speed predicted by the assumed theory .",
    "if , on the other hand , the signal being tracked is a _ long duration _",
    "signal , then a single antenna may be sufficient to peform the test by looking at the observed doppler patterns and checking them against those expected with the given @xmath87 .",
    "the above considerations have been made ignoring noise in the detector and monitor systems .",
    "a fundamental constraint introduced by noise is that it makes the antenna _ bandwidth limited _ in sensitivity . as a consequence ,",
    "any deconvolution procedure is deemed to be incomplete or , rather , _ ambiguous _",
    "@xcite , since information about the signal can possibly be retrieved only within a reduced bandwidth , whilst the rest will be lost .",
    "i thus come to a detailed discussion of the sensitivity of the spherical gw antenna in the next section .",
    "i will consider successively _ amplitude _ and _ energy _ sensitivities ; the first leads to the concept of _ transfer function _ , while the second to that of absorption _ cross section_. i devote separate subsections to analyse each of them in some detail .",
    "a widely used and useful concept in linear system theory is that of _ transfer function _ @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the fourier transform of the system s impulse response , or as the system s impedance / admittance , and can be inferred from the frequency response function ( [ 3.18 ] ) .",
    "we recall from the previous section that the sphere is a multimode device due to its monopole and five - fold degenerate quadrupole modes .",
    "it appears expedient to define a _",
    "multimode _ or _ vector transfer function _ as a useful construct which encompasses all six different modes into a single conceptual block , according to    @xmath88    where @xmath89 are the six driving terms @xmath79 given in ( [ 3.19 ] ) .",
    "the transfer function is @xmath90 , and its `` vector '' character alluded above is reflected by the _ multimode index _ @xmath91 .",

    "as is well known , gr is obtained in the limit @xmath166 of bd @xcite ; the quoted results are of course in agreement with that limit .",
    "incidentally , an interesting consequence of the above equations is this : though not explicitly shown in this paper ( see , however , reference @xcite ) , the presence of a scalar field in the theory of brans and dicke causes _ not only the monopole _",
    "sphere s modes to be excited , _ but also the @xmath56=0 quadrupole ones _ ; what we see in equations ( [ 4.26 ] ) is that _",
    "precisely _ 5/6 of the total energy extracted from the scalar wave goes into the antenna s monopole modes , whilst there is still a remaining 1/6 which is communicated to the quadrupoles , independently of the values of @xmath164 and @xmath167 .",
    "this somehow non - intuitive result finds its explanation in the structure of the riemann tensor in bd theory , in which the _ excess _ @xmath168 with respect to general relativity happens _ not _ to be proportional to the scalar part @xmath37 , but to a combination of @xmath37    equations ( [ 4.23 ] ) show that , no matter which is the gravity theory assumed , the sphere s absorption cross sections for higher modes _ scale _ as the successive coefficients @xmath169 and @xmath170 for monopole and quadrupole modes , respectively . in particular , the result quoted in @xcite that cross section for the second quadrupole mode is 2.61 times less than that for the first , assuming gr , is in fact valid , as we now see , _ independently of which is the ( metric ) theory of gravity actually governing gw physics_. the fourth columns in table i display these scaling properties .",
    "it is seen that the drop in cross section from the first to the second monopole mode is as high as 6.46 .",
    "it should however be stressed that the frequency of such mode would be over 4 khz for a ( likely ) sphere whose fundamental _ quadrupole _ frequency be 900 hz  @xcite .",
    "note finally the asymptotic cross section drop as @xmath171 for large @xmath57 cf .",

    "the main purpose of this paper has been to set up a _ sound _ mathematical formalism to tackle with as much generality as possible any questions related to the interaction between a resonant antenna and a weak incoming gw , with much special emphasis on the homogeneous _",
    "sphere_. new results have been found along this line , such as the _ scaling _ properties of cross sections for higher frequency modes , or the sensitivity of the antenna to arbitrary metric gws ; also , new ideas have been put forward regarding the _ direction deconvolution _",
    "problem within the context of an arbitrary metric theory of gw physics .",
    "less spectacularly , the full machinery has also been applied to produce _ independent _ checks of previously published results .",
    "the whole investigation reported herein has been developed with no _ a priori _ assumptions about any specific ( metric ) theory of the gws , and is therefore _ very _ general .",
    "`` too general solutions '' are often impractical in science ; here , however , the `` very general '' appears to be rather `` cheap '' , as seen in the results expressed by the equations of section 3 above .",
    "an immediate consequence is that solid elastic detectors of gws ( and , in particular , spheres ) offer , as a matter of principle , the possibility of probing _ any _ given theory of gw physics with just as much effort as it would take , e.g. , to probe general relativity : the vector transfer function of section 4 supplies the requisite theoretical vehicle for the purpose .",
    "an important question , however , has not been considered in this paper .",
    "this is the _ transducer _ problem : the sphere s oscillations can only be revelaed to the observer by means of suitable ( usually electromechanical ) transducers .",
    "these devices , however , are not _ neutral _ , i.e. , they _ couple _ to the antenna s motions , thereby excercising a back action on it which must be taken into consideration if one is to correctly interpret the system s readout .",
    "preliminary studies and proposals have already been published @xcite , but further work is clearly needed for a more thorough understanding of the problems involved .",
    "we say that the vectors ( [ a.1 ] ) are the _ natural basis _ for the @xmath55=1 irreducible representation of the rotation group ; they behave under arbitrary rotations precisely like the spherical harmonics @xmath175 . in particular ,",
    "if a rotation of angle @xmath176 around the is applied to the original frame , then      higher rank tensors have specific multipole characteristics depending on the number of tensor indices , and the above basis lends itself to reveal those characteristics , too .",
    "for example , the five dimensional linear space of traceless symmetric tensors supports the @xmath55=2 irreducible representation of the rotation group , while a tensor s trace is an invariant .",
    "a general symmetric tensor can be expressed as an `` orthogonal '' sum of a traceless symmetric tensor and a multiple of the unit tensor . a convenient basis to expand",
