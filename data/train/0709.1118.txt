    "since their introduction by roger penrose @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , twistor spaces have proven to be very successful in the study of riemannian manifolds with special properties .",
    "they allow one to encode subtle geometric information into holomorphic objects . in this way",
    ", powerful tools of complex and algebraic geometry can come into play and reveal in a rather unexpected way new properties of the original geometric situation .",
    "a recent example of such a phenomenon was discovered by lebrun and mason @xcite in their study of zoll metrics on a compact surface .    in general ,",
    "a zoll metric on a manifold is a metric whose geodesics are simple closed curves of equal length .",
    "the terminology is in honor of otto zoll @xcite , who discovered that the 2-dimensional sphere @xmath0 has many such metrics beside the standard one .",
    "later on , it was speculated by funk @xcite and proven by guillemin @xcite that the tangent space of the moduli space of zoll metrics on @xmath0 ( modulo isometries and rescaling ) at the standard round metric is isomorphic to the space of odd functions @xmath4 . in particular , this indicates that the moduli space of zoll metrics on @xmath0 is infinite dimensional .",
    "the only other compact surface admitting a zoll metric , @xmath5 , has a very different behavior in that respect since , as was conjectured by blaschke and proved by leon green @xcite , it admits only one zoll metric modulo rescaling and isometries .    via the use of twistor theory ,",
    "lebrun and mason were able in @xcite to recover all these results in a very elegant and novel way . in the case",
    "of the sphere @xmath0 , their twistor correspondence associates to a zoll metric on @xmath0 a family of holomorphic disks in @xmath1 with boundary in a totally real submanifold @xmath3 such that there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath6 identifying @xmath7 with the standard @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , it is such that each holomorphic disk of the family represents a generator of @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , the standard round metric on @xmath0 corresponds to a family of holomorphic disks with boundary lying on the standard @xmath8 .    in the case of the standard @xmath8",
    ", one can check rather directly that there is a unique family of holomorphic disks associated to it .",
    "this is because considering the involution @xmath10 & \\mapsto & [ \\overline{x}_{0}:\\overline{x}_{1}:\\overline{x}_{2 } ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] having the standard @xmath5 as a fixed set , we can double any holomorphic disk @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 to obtain a holomorphic curve @xmath14 in the case of a zoll family , @xmath15 has to represent a generator of @xmath16 , which means @xmath17 is a curve of degree @xmath18 in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , @xmath19 is the zero locus of a homogeneous polynomial of degree 1 .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients of this polynomial can be chosen to be real since @xmath20 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath15 has to be a member of the family of holomorphic disks corresponding to the standard zoll metric on @xmath0 .",
    "however , in the more general situation where @xmath3 does not come from the fixed set of an antiholomorphic involution , the above argument has no obvious generalization . in principle",
    ", one could therefore imagine situations where two distincts zoll metrics on @xmath0 would lead to two distinct families of holomorphic disks with boundary on the same totally real submanifold @xmath3 .",
    "this would mean the totally real submanifold @xmath3 would not be sufficient to recover the zoll metric from which it comes from .    in this paper",
    ", we rule out this possibility by showing that for a totally real submanifold @xmath3 such that there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath6 identifying @xmath7 with the standard @xmath5 , there is at most one family of holomorphic disks coming from a zoll metric on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the twistor correspondence of lebrun and mason , which to a zoll metric on @xmath0 associate a totally real submanifold @xmath3 , is injective .",
    "in fact , we show that given such a family , any holomorphic disk @xmath11 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and such that it is a generator of @xmath23 necessarily has to be a member of the family ( see theorem  [ uzs.1 ] in  [ ucf.0 ] ) .",
    "our proof is by contradiction .",
    "we suppose that there is such a holomorphic disk @xmath11 which is not in the family .",
    "then we show that there exists a holomorphic disk @xmath24 in the family such that @xmath15 and @xmath24 intersect transversally and have a non - empty intersection in @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath24 have boundaries , the intersection number one gets is not a homotopy invariant .",
    "our strategy is to look at the lifts @xmath26 and @xmath27 of @xmath15 and @xmath24 in the blow - up ( in the sense of melrose ) @xmath28.\\ ] ] since the family of holomorphic disks defines a circle fibration on @xmath29 , we have an alternative way of blowing down @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the corresponding blow - down map .",
    "in this blow - down procedure , each disk becomes a sphere , so eliminating the boundary .",
    "we can also get a sphere out of @xmath15 by deforming it before blowing down with @xmath32 . doing it carefully",
    ", we can insure that the intersection number between @xmath33 and @xmath34 remains positive .",
    "one can also check that the corresponding spheres @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the blow - down picture are homologous . by construction , the oriented intersection number of these two spheres will be positive , which leads to a contradiction , since the self - intersection number of the corresponding homology class is shown to be equal to zero .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ pre.0 ] ,",
    "we review standard results of differential topology . in section  [ cf.0 ] , we introduce the notion of complete family of @xmath37-holomorphic curves , while in section  [ zm.0 ] , we explain how it naturally arises in the twistor correspondence of lebrun and mason . in section  [ ucf.0 ] , we state and prove the main result .",
    "the author would like to warmly thank claude lebrun for suggesting the problem studied in this paper , for many helpful discussions and for giving very nice lectures on twistor spaces .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the manifolds and maps considered in this paper will be assumed to be smooth . to clarify our conventions with orientation ,",
    "let us review briefly basic concepts of differential topology .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be smooth manifolds , possibly with boundary .",
    "let @xmath40 be a smooth submanifold , possibly also with a boundary .",
    "then a smooth map @xmath41 is said to be * transversal * to the submanifold @xmath42 if for each @xmath43 , @xmath44 in that case , and when @xmath39 and @xmath42 do not have a boundary , the preimage @xmath45 is a submanifold of @xmath39 of codimension equal to the codimension of @xmath42 in @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath46 and @xmath42 are oriented manifolds , then @xmath47 has a natural induced orientation .",

    "let @xmath48 be the normal bundle of @xmath47 in @xmath39 .",
    "choosing a riemannian metric on @xmath39 , we can think of @xmath48 as a subbundle of @xmath49 .",
    "then , for @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 let @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 be oriented basis of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the first equation determines an orientation on @xmath58 by declaring a basis @xmath59 of @xmath60 oriented if @xmath61 is an oriented basis of @xmath55 . using the second equation , this in turn determines an orientation on @xmath62 by declaring a basis @xmath63 of @xmath62 oriented if @xmath64 is an oriented basis of @xmath56 whenever @xmath59 is an oriented basis of @xmath65 .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when the dimension of @xmath39 is the same as the codimension of @xmath42 in @xmath38 . in that case",
    ", the submanifold @xmath66 is a discrete set of points which is finite if @xmath39 is compact .",
    "each of these point has an orientation @xmath67 provided by the preimage orientation .",
    "we define the * oriented intersection number * between @xmath68 and @xmath42 , denoted @xmath69 , to be the sum of their orientations numbers .",
    "defined this way , it turns out ( see for instance @xcite ) that the oriented intersection number only depends on the homotopy class of the map @xmath68 when both @xmath39 and @xmath42 are compact manifolds without boundary .",
    "more generally , when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath42 are not oriented , the intersection number modulo 2 still only depends on the homotopy class of @xmath68 .",
    "the transversality of a map is a natural and generic property which is usually easy to satisfy modulo small perturbations of the map . in this paper",
