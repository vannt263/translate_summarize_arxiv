    "<S> the application of the method to the rabi model evoked some doubts about its reliability @xcite . in this letter , we propose such treatment of @xmath0-expansion series which provides , in low approximation orders , extraordinarily accurate estimates of the ground state energy in the whole range of model s parameters . </S>",
    "<S> first we explain the @xmath0-expansion method , then summarize the variational approaches to the rabi hamiltonian , propose a stationarity treatment of the @xmath0-expansion with two - parameter trial functions and finally present accurate numerical results .    </S>",
