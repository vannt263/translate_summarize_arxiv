    "at the electron - proton collider , hera , which operated at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath2 , possible signatures of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) are investigated by looking for events in which one or more high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) leptons are found in the final state .",
    "the leptons provide a clean event signature , and the investigation of the high mass , high @xmath3 regions , where the sm expectation is low , could reveal some signal of new physics .    the two experiments zeus and h1 at hera are extensively studying such events , using the full available statistics .",
    "the search is focused on topologies in which one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) is found in the final state together with missing @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , and on topologies in which more than one isolated lepton is found .",
    "in the sm , the dominant contribution to the production of a high-@xmath3 isolated lepton together with missing @xmath3 is the production of real @xmath5 bosons , where the @xmath5 decays into a lepton and a neutrino .",
    "the sm cross section of this process , known at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) with an uncertainty of 15%  @xcite , is of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "the event simulation is based on the leading - order epvec monte carlo ( mc ) generator , reweighted to the @xmath5 cross section at nlo  @xcite .",
    "the main background sources in this search come from the misreconstruction of the leptons or of the energy in the event .",
    "neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( nc - dis ) events , @xmath7 , in which the energy is not properly reconstructed , can lead to fake @xmath8 and therefore to a fake signal in the electron channel ; charged current events , which have genuine @xmath8 , can mimic a signal if a fake lepton is identified in the event ; dimuon events , in which one of the two muons is not identifed , can also mimic a fake signal in the muon channel .",
    "alternative event samples were used to verify that the fake signal rates were well simulated by the mc .",
    "the h1 collaboration analysed the hera i data sample ( luminosity , @xmath9 ) and reported  @xcite an excess of this kind of events with respect to the sm predictions .",
    "the analysis was then extended to the full data sample collected by h1  @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 .",
    "the sample consists of @xmath11 of data collected in electron - proton collisions , and @xmath12 of data collected in positron - proton collisions .",
    "the event selection required a lepton ( electron or muon ) with @xmath13 in the angular range @xmath14 .",
    "the lepton had to be isolated from the rest of the event : the isolation was quantified using the distance between the lepton and the nearest jet or the nearest track in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the event had also to show a large imbalance in transverse momentum , reconstructed using the calorimeter and the tracking information .",
    ".h1 results of the search for events with an isolated high-@xmath3 lepton and @xmath8 .",
    "the data are compared with the sm predictions , separately for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and for the full sample , combining the electron and the muon channels . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the h1 collaboration recently published  @xcite the final multi - lepton analysis based on the full hera data sample , @xmath18 .",
    "all the possible topologies in which muons or electrons are found in the final state were exclusively considered .",
    "therefore , new event topologies such as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 were analysed , together with the di - muon , di- and tri - electron final states already studied .",
    "the final multi - lepton selection required that there were at least two central ( @xmath23 ) lepton ( electron or muon ) candidates , one of which had to have @xmath24  gev and the other @xmath25 5  gev .",
    "additional electrons were searched for in the angular range @xmath26 , and additional muons in @xmath27 . according to the flavours of the identified leptons",
    ", these samples were classified into the different topologies listed above .",
    "the observed event yields are in good agreement with sm expectations , which are dominated by pair production . when requiring @xmath28  gev , 5 events are observed in @xmath16 collisons , whilst @xmath29 are expected from the sm ; no events are observed at high @xmath30 in @xmath17 data .",
    "the zeus and h1 collaborations at the electron - proton collider hera perform searches for events with an isolated high-@xmath3 lepton and missing @xmath3 , and for multi - lepton events .",
    "the cross sections of these processes are well known in the standard model and deviations in the high mass and high @xmath3 region could reveal a signal of new physics .",
    "all the observations are in good agreement with the sm predictions , although a few high-@xmath3 events are observed in the @xmath16 data in a region where the expectations from the sm are low .",
