    "potassium ( k ) atom has three naturally abundant isotopes with atomic mass numbers 39 , 40 and 41 . using the modern femtosecond laser frequency combs and polarization quantum - beat techniques , high precision measurements of hyperfine structure constants in @xmath13 and @xmath14 states are carried out @xcite .",
    "also , a number of measurements of these quantities were carried out in the ground and other states long ago using the atomic beam magnetic resonance and level crossing techniques ( e.g. see review article by arimondo _",
    "theoretical studies of these quantities are of immense interest to atomic physicists to test the accuracies of the wave functions in the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical evaluation of these quantities require atomic calculations and nuclear moments @xcite .",
    "nuclear magnetic moments ( @xmath15s ) of the above k isotopes are known very precisely and the reported results from various studies matches reasonably well with each other @xcite . on the other hand , the reported nuclear quadrupole moments ( @xmath0s ) from various works on these isotopes differ significantly .",
    "for example , @xmath0 value of @xmath1k is reported as 0.07(2 ) @xmath2 @xcite , 0.049(4 ) @xmath2 @xcite , 0.0601(15 ) @xmath2 @xcite and 0.0585 @xmath2 within one percent error @xcite .",
    "the latest result , 0.0585(6 ) @xmath2 , is now considered as the standard @xmath0 value for @xmath1k @xcite .",
    "accurate knowledge of @xmath0 values of these isotopes are useful in many applications .",
    "these information are interesting in order to test the potential of nuclear models @xcite , acquiring information about local symmetry @xcite , to find out asymmetry parameters in nuclei @xcite , for studying the mossbauer spectroscopy for the structural determination of the element containing solid state compounds @xcite etc .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants for many states in k and report precise @xmath0 values of its above mentioned isotopes .",
    "as discussed later , we find the new values to be larger than the considered standard values in the literature . atomic wave functions are calculated using relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method in the fock - space representation and matrix elements of the hyperfine interaction hamiltonians are estimated using these wave functions in the considered atom .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we present briefly the theory of hyperfine structure in an atomic system and the single particle matrix elements of the interaction hamiltonians which are used to evaluate the hyperfine structure constants . in sec iii , we explain the rcc method little elaborately for the calculation of atomic wave functions .",
    "then , we present the results and their discussions before summarizing the work . unless stated otherwise , we use atomic unit ( au ) throughout this paper .",
    "the hyperfine structures of energy levels in an atom arise due to the interaction between electron angular momenta with the nuclear spin .",
    "details of this theory is given by c. schwartz in a classic paper @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the hyperfine interaction hamiltonian is given in a general form as non - central interaction between electrons and the nucleus in terms of tensor operators as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the spherical tensor operators of rank @xmath19 in the space of electronic and nuclear coordinates , respectively .",
    "in the first order perturbation theory , the hyperfine interaction energy @xmath20 of hyperfine state @xmath21 with total angular momentum @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the nuclear spin and electronic angular momentum of the associated fine structure state @xmath25 , respectively , taking up to @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath12 and @xmath3 are known as the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constant for @xmath29 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the advantage of expressing the change in energy in this form is it separates out the electronic and nuclear factors for which the calculations can be carried out in a simple approach . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath3 are given by @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the above expressions , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the nuclear magneton and gyromagnetic ratio , respectively . since",
    "our intention is to verify accuracies of @xmath0 values , we estimate @xmath4 results in this work .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of the electronic spherical tensor operators , @xmath34 , in terms of single orbitals are given by @xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the relativistic angular momentum quantum number and large ( small ) component of dirac spinor for the corresponding orbital @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of racah tensors ( @xmath41 ) are given by @xcite @xmath42 with the angular momentum selection rule @xmath43 when @xmath44 for the orbital angular momentum @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; otherwise it is zero .",
    "accurate generation of atomic orbitals in the nuclear region is very important for the present study .",
    "we consider here gaussian type of orbitals ( gtos ) which provide natural description of relativistic wave - functions within nucleus @xcite as basis to construct the mean - field orbitals in the dirac(hartree)-fock ( df ) approach .",
    "kinetic balanced condition between the large and small components of dirac spinor are imposed to ensure correct non - relativistic behavior of the orbitals @xcite .",
    "gtos to construct an orbital at a particular location @xmath47 are defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents for large ( small ) component , @xmath19 denotes number of gtos , @xmath50 correspond to normalization factor for each gto and @xmath51 is an arbitrary parameter which has to be chosen suitably for orbitals from different @xmath52 symmetries . to get more flexibility in optimization of our basis sets , we use",
    "the even tempering condition by defining two more parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 the radial grid points @xmath47 are defined as @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 is the starting radial function taken inside the nucleus to be @xmath58 at which the wave functions become finite and @xmath59 is a step size which is defined by taking maximum radial function @xmath60 as @xmath61 au and total grid points @xmath62 .",
    "we have considered 40 gtos for each @xmath63 symmetry orbitals and the considered @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in table [ tab1 ] for different @xmath63 values .",
    "due to limitation over computational resources and negligible contributions from the high lying virtual orbitals , we have taken up to 24 orbitals from @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 symmetries and 17 orbitals from @xmath67 , @xmath68 symmetries to construct active space for rcc calculations .",

    "<S> nuclear quadrupole moments ( @xmath0s ) in three isotopes of potassium ( k ) with atomic mass numbers 39 , 40 and 41 are evaluated more precisely in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 value of @xmath1k is determined to be 0.0614(6 ) @xmath2 by combining the available experimental result of the electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constant ( @xmath3 ) with our calculated @xmath4 result of its @xmath5 state . furthermore combining this @xmath0 value with the measured ratios @xmath0(@xmath6k)@xmath7(@xmath8k ) and @xmath0(@xmath9k)@xmath7(@xmath8k ) , we obtain @xmath0(@xmath6k)@xmath10 and @xmath0(@xmath9k)@xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these results disagree with the recently quoted standard values in the nuclear data table within the given uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are carried out by employing the relativistic coupled - cluster theory at the singles , doubles and involving important valence triples approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracies of the calculated @xmath4 results can be viewed on the basis of comparison between our calculated magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants ( @xmath12s ) with their corresponding measurements for many low - lying states . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath12 and @xmath3 results in few more excited states are presented for the first time . </S>"
