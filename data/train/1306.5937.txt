    "long - baseline optical interferometry ( with baselines up to hundreds of meters in length ) has enabled us to measure angular diameters of bright stars , with typical values of a few milliarcseconds .",
    "combined with accurate parallax and photometry , these measurements allow direct determination of fundamental stellar properties , such as the linear radii of their photospheres or the effective surface temperature of the stars , and have become a very valuable tool to contrast observational results with stellar models of increasing complexity .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite , using the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer ( nsii ) , provided angular sizes of 32 o- to f- type stars .",
    "subsequently , @xcite established the empirical temperature scale for stars of spectral type f5 and earlier by means of combining @xcite diameters with multiband spectra from which they inferred bolometric fluxes .",
    "the majority of the stars observed with the nsii belonged to luminosity classes i - iii , and only about one third of them were main sequence or subgiant stars ( luminosity classes iv or v ) , since the instrument favoured observations of stars with larger diameters , given the same surface brightness . for several decades , all the early type star ( between o0 and a7 ) diameter measurements ( a total of 16 ) came from the nsii observations @xcite . even in more recent years",
    ", the papers referenced in the charm2 catalogue @xcite contained just 24 entries corresponding to direct diameter measurements for main sequence or sub - giant stars .",
    "the advent of optical long baseline interferometry using hectometric baselines , particularly in the near infrared , has provided rapid progress in the number of main sequence and subgiant stars with direct diameter measurements .",
    "most notably , @xcite reported interferometric diameter measurements for 44 g - type or later main sequence stars , deriving colour - temperature relations , and @xcite published results of a survey carried out on a combined sample of 77 dwarfs spanning from a to m spectral type , developing new empirical laws relating broad - band colours and effective temperature .    as a result of resolution and sensitivity constraints particularly in the near - infrared , there is a clear sample bias , as only 5 out of the 121 stars studied in these papers belong to spectral class a or earlier .",
    "the major stumbling block has been that to access significant populations of hot stars , resolutions better than 1 milliarcsecond are required .",
    "the rise of beam combiners that can operate in the visible range of the spectrum with improved sensitivity , such as pavo@chara , allows routine measurements of submilliarcsecond stellar diameters @xcite , and offers the possibility to extend the spectral range to earlier type stars within similar sensitivity constraints .",
    "obtaining precise individual properties of b and a main sequence stars is of considerable importance in stellar astrophysics , since they represent the most massive and luminous objects that can be described by models containing simplifying assumptions such as lte physics , hydrostatic equilibrium or purely radiative envelopes , in contrast to those corresponding to more massive or evolved objects , providing a useful benchmark for stellar atmosphere models .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic higher surface brightness of early type ( mainly b and a ) stars makes them suitable calibration stars @xcite for correction of instrumental and atmospheric effects in visible and near infrared interferometry .",
    "therefore , direct measurement of submilliarcsecond angular stellar diameters has the potential to improve calibration of interferometric observations of objects with larger projected sizes .",
    "the drawback is that stars earlier than f6 often rotate rapidly @xcite .",
    "as the rotational velocity approaches its critical value , the centrifugal force induces latitudinal temperature gradients ( an effect known as _ gravity darkening _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , depending on the inclination of the stellar rotation axis , the apparent stellar disk may look oblate . projected rotational velocities can be used to model the effect of rotation in the interferometric observables @xcite , with the finding that effects of low rotation rates can be neglected for low spatial frequencies .    in this paper",
    ", we present results of our pilot study on a small sample of 10 nearby stars with submilliarcsecond angular size with spectral types in the b2-f6 range .",
    "computed bolometric fluxes , together with precise _ hipparcos _ parallaxes have been used to derive the fundamental stellar parameters linear radius , luminosity and effective temperature , with results that are in good agreement with measurements obtained using independent methods . finally , we have estimated stellar mass and ages by means of isochrone model fitting .",
    "the stars observed in our study are extensively used as calibrators in near - infrared interferometry , mainly in observations using the mirc ( michigan infrared combiner ) instrument ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to their use in fundamental parameters of the observed stars ( in combination with other measurements ) , angular diameter estimation constitutes a direct measurement of the interferometric response independent of diameter estimates based on indirect methods ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that rely on high fidelity sed templates or stellar atmosphere models .",

    "it also includes the measured _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite .",
    "these parallaxes correspond to distances smaller than @xmath3200pc , with uncertainties ranging from 1% to 5% for most of the stars observed .",

    "measured diameters show generally good agreement with predictions based on colour relations or sed fits , as well as with previous interferometric measurements . @xmath42 data points beyond the first null for @xmath58leo enable simultaneous estimation of diameter and linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath37 . whereas the derived diameter is less than 1% larger than the fixed limb darkening estimation , the estimated value for @xmath37 exceeds by @xmath5420% the value interpolated in @xcite using stellar atmosphere parameters .",
    "this enhanced limb darkening , together with the star s low projected rotational velocity , suggests that @xmath58leo is in fact a fast rotating star viewed nearly pole - on .",
    "we derived bolometric fluxes from sed fits of theoretical atlas9 stellar atmosphere models to optical and near - infrared photometric data , as well as including flux calibrated _ iue _ ultraviolet spectra , accounting for the effects of interstellar reddening .",
    "the mean absolute deviation between derived effective temperatures and estimates using spectroscopy is @xmath543% .",
    "the agreement is excellent for main sequence stars , and only for two of the b giants , @xmath1lyr , and @xmath4cyg and the main - squence star @xmath59aur , the discrepancy is as large as @xmath547% .",
    "comparison with @xcite , for the subset of overlapping objects from our sample reveals an excellent agreement in the results of both studies , despite some subtle differences in the modelling assumptions .",
    "our derived effective temperatures for a and f type stars confirm the sixth - order polynomial ( @xmath60 ) color - temperature relation presented in @xcite .",
    "however , there is a clear disagreement with their sixth - order ( @xmath61)-temperature relation , and our data clearly favours the ( @xmath61 ) cubic polynomial presented by @xcite .",
    "different inclination angles of the polar axis between boyajian s sample of a and early f stars with respect to ours , together with the effects of fast rotation in these stars might explain the observed discrepancy .",
    "new observations of main - sequence stars in this range of temperature , correcting the scarcity of available data should provide the basis for a more detailed empirical colour - temperature relation .",
    "the parsec model isochrone fit in the temperature - luminosity plane provides mass values that are consistent with the estimated gravitational masses computed from spectroscopically determined @xmath2 , showing larger discrepancies for larger mass values .",
    "the unphysical result obtained for @xmath1lyr gravitational mass , together with the large scatter in temperature estimations using spectroscopy questions the accuracy of @xmath1lyr atmosphere parameters , and suggests strong degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
