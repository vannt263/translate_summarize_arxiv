    "inflation is a very successful paradigm for solving the horizon and flatness problems and for creating the almost scale - invariant , adiabatic perturbations that have been observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how cosmic inflation is realized within particle theory .",
    "most importantly , the identity of the inflaton field , which drives the rapid expansion , is still unknown .",
    "various models of inflation have been proposed in the literature , however often the inflaton is just an additional gauge singlet , rather disconnected from the rest of the theory .",
    "a proposed framework for connecting inflation with particle physics is supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite in which inflation is ended by a particle physics phase transition .",
    "the energy scale of this phase transition is around the grand unification ( gut ) scale : @xmath3 gev .",
    "this inspires hope that hybrid inflation may be connected to the spontaneous breaking of a gut symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , the inflaton itself must be a singlet in such models , and the predictions for the cmb fluctuations  which depend on the properties of the inflaton  usually can not be related to other observables .",
    "this issue was improved by the development of supersymmetric tribrid inflation @xcite , which is a variant of hybrid inflation where the inflaton itself can be charged under the symmetries of the particle theory @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can be a charged matter particle and might have observable effects in the low - energy theory .",
    "this could make it possible to determine the inflaton couplings both from particle physics constraints and from measurements of the cmb at the same time . in models of tribrid inflation",
    "studied so far , the inflaton potential was dominantly generated by either one - loop corrections from the coleman - weinberg potential , or by small vacuum expectation values of non - inflaton fields like the waterfall field .",
    "we refer to these regimes as loop - driven and ( pseudo)smooth @xcite tribrid inflation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to complete the discussion of variants of tribrid inflation by analyzing the third possibility , namely the case that tribrid inflation is driven dominantly by effects from higher - dimensional operators of the khler potential .",
    "based on a generalized superpotential for tribrid inflation we specify for which parameters the khler - driven regime is realized , calculate the slow - roll predictions and show how it can be experimentally distinguished from the other two regimes by a measurement of the running of the spectral index .",
    "we also discuss how the new class of inflation models might be embedded into supersymmetric gut and/or flavour models .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : we first motivate and introduce tribrid inflation in section [ sec : generalizedtribrid ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : scalarpotential ]  [ sec : loops ] we discuss the khler - driven regime and derive the predictions using a power series expansion of the khler potential .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our findings and compares our results for khler - driven with loop - driven and pseudosmooth tribrid inflation .",
    "there we also discuss how our results can be used for model building , using tribrid inflation as a framework for building explicit particle physics models of inflation .",
    "before we introduce tribrid inflation , let us review the basic properties of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite , which in its simplest form is given by the superpotential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inflaton field , @xmath6 is the so - called waterfall field , @xmath7 is a mass scale and @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 can be chosen real without loss of generality by global phase redefinitions of the fields .",
    "the resulting scalar potential has a nearly flat valley along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the flatness along this direction is lifted by loop corrections from the coleman - weinberg potential and by planck - suppressed operators in the khler potential .",
    "this generates a gentle slope suitable for slow - roll inflation . below some critical value @xmath9",
    ", however , the waterfall field @xmath6 gets a tachyonic mass .",
    "this triggers a waterfall transition which usually ends inflation very quickly @xcite .",
    "hybrid inflation is attractive for various reasons .",
    "it is a small - field model of inflation , which means that field values stay well below the planck scale .",
    "this allows to study it in an effective field theory ( eft ) framework and predictions can be derived using only a finite number of operators with low mass dimension , while operators of higher mass dimension are safely suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "in addition , when comparing the model s predictions with the measured cmb spectrum , the mass scale @xmath10 turns out to be of the order of the grand unification scale : @xmath11 gev .",
    "this inspires hope that models of hybrid inflation could be related to some gut phase transition .",
    "an important restriction of the conventional supersymmetric hybrid inflation model discussed above is that @xmath5 must be introduced as a singlet under all symmetries , except for a possible r - symmetry , because the hybrid superpotential in eq .",
    "requires a linear term @xmath12 . as a gauge singlet ,",
    "the inflaton is somewhat disconnected from the main particle theory : particles in the matter sector are mostly disqualified as inflaton candidates , because they are usually not singlets .",
    "a notable exception is the right - handed sneutrino @xcite which may play a role in neutrino mass generation while being a gauge singlet within , for instance , the mssm or su(5 ) guts . in pati - salam unified models or so(10 ) guts ,",
    "even the right - handed sneutrino is charged under the gauge group and can not be the inflaton of conventional supersymmetric hybrid inflation .    for model - building purposes , it is desirable to allow non - singlets as inflaton fields and still retain the attractive features of hybrid inflation .",
    "this motivates the introduction of the tribrid superpotential : @xmath13 where we used natural units with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "is not compatible with a waterfall transition , @xmath18 generates an overly steep inflaton potential and @xmath19 tends to lead to high - scale susy breaking and requires that @xmath5 is a singlet , which removes one of the main benefits of tribrid inflation . ]",
    "the singlet @xmath20 is no longer the inflaton , but an auxiliary field which will be stabilized near zero both during and after inflation . it is only required to induce the term @xmath21 in the scalar potential . the inflaton @xmath5 is coupled to @xmath6 by a non - renormalizable operator with coupling constant @xmath22 ; this term will provide the @xmath5-dependent mass term of the waterfall field .",
    "note that @xmath5 no longer appears linearly in the superpotential , so @xmath5 can be charged under symmetries , including gauge symmetries .    in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to models of inflation which are at least qualitatively similar to models of conventional supersymmetric hybrid inflation .",
    "this means , we will demand that @xmath5 is the inflaton of single - field slow - roll inflation , and that inflation is terminated by a waterfall in @xmath6 when @xmath23 becomes negative . or @xmath6 can be the inflaton , or where inflation happens along non - trivial multi - field trajectories .",
    "although these are interesting models of inflation in their own right , they are not the subject of this paper . ]    in general , we should also include the effects of the khler potential @xmath24 .",
    "we are working with small - field models below the planck scale , so we can expand the khler potential in powers of the fields : @xmath25 where the coefficients in front of the quadratic terms are fixed by the normalization of the fields .",
    "the khler potential is assumed to depend only on the modulus squared of the fields , which may be enforced by a suitable choice of symmetries .",
    "models of tribrid inflation , with @xmath26 and @xmath24 as specified above , can generate a small slope for the inflaton in three different ways :    1 .   by loop corrections from the coleman - weinberg potential , 2 .   from small , non - vanishing vacuum expectation values for @xmath6 and @xmath20 already during inflation , 3 .   or by planck - suppressed operators from the khler potential .    in principle ,",
    "mixed cases are possible , where all three sources contribute .",
    "however , it often happens that one of these effects dominates while the others can be neglected or added as small corrections .",
    "we call these limiting cases the loop - driven , the the ( pseudo-)smooth and the khler - driven regime .",
    "the loop - driven regime has been studied e.g.  in @xcite including some effects from the khler potential .",
    "it is similar to conventional hybrid inflation both in its dynamics and in its predictions .",
    "one generally finds that @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath11 gev .",
    "@xmath29 can take any value in the range still allowed by the wmap7 data @xcite , depending on the choice of the khler potential .",
    "the pseudosmooth regime has been explored recently in @xcite , though only for specific khler potentials and for @xmath30 . for these cases ,",
    "the results are similar to the loop - driven regime , apart from @xmath29 , for which @xmath31 is predicted .    in the remainder of this paper , we study the khler - driven regime , which has not been analyzed so far . in section [ sec : scalarpotential ] , we identify the parts of the scalar potential which are relevant for tribrid inflation .",
    "section [ sec : slowrollkahler ] is devoted to calculating the slow - roll predictions from the inflaton potential , and in section [ sec : kahlerinflationconstraints ] we derive constraints from the waterfall dynamics .",
    "afterwards , we can estimate that the loop corrections are in fact small for a large fraction of the constrained parameter space .",
    "we now discuss under which conditions khler - driven tribrid inflation , along the lines discussed above , can be realized . to this end , the following requirements will be imposed :    * the slow - roll predictions for the cmb spectrum are determined by the inflaton potential .",
    "these predictions must be compatible with experimental exclusion limits . * during inflation , @xmath6 and @xmath20 must have masses above the hubble scale @xmath32 ; otherwise we do not have single - field inflation in @xmath5 .",
    "* @xmath6 must have a tachyonic instability for small @xmath5 for the waterfall to happen .    to study these requirements ,",
    "we decompose the potential : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the squared masses of the real and complex part of @xmath6 .",
    "we note that in the considered class of models , @xmath37 .",
    "the interaction terms of the inflaton field which are quadratic in @xmath6 or @xmath20 have been absorbed in an inflaton dependence of the masses : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the dots denote terms which have been dropped because they are irrelevant for our discussion .    for single - field inflation , @xmath20 and @xmath6",
    "must be stabilized at 0 during inflation ; is stable during inflation .",
    "@xmath40 corresponds to tribrid inflation in the ( pseudo-)smooth regime @xcite . ]",
    "their masses are required to be larger than the hubble scale @xmath41 : @xmath42 for @xmath43 . for inflation to end via a waterfall phase transition , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 can be ignored ; it is stabilized during inflation due to @xmath47 .",
    "if these necessary conditions are satisfied , slow - roll inflation depends only on the single - field inflaton potential @xmath48 and on the critical field value @xmath49 which can be calculated from the potential by solving @xmath50 for @xmath49 .",
    "we can then use @xmath51 and the critical field value @xmath49 to derive the slow - roll predictions .",
    "the supergravity scalar potential for chiral superfields can be calculated from @xmath26 and @xmath24 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the matrix inverse of the khler metric @xmath54 , and @xmath55 inflation is assumed to happen along a d - flat direction , so d - term contributions are ignored .",
    "the kinetic terms are @xmath56 these kinetic terms are not yet canonical due to planck - suppressed operators in the khler potential . during inflation , we can achieve canonical kinetic terms by a field transformation ( see appendix [ appendix : canonicalnormalization ] for details ) .",
    "this canonical normalization has the net effect of inducing higher - dimensional operators in our potential .",
    "its effect on the results turns out to be very small , but it is nevertheless included for completeness and because it does not add any new complications .",
    "we can now determine the inflaton potential @xmath51 from eqs .   and and dropping all terms proportional to @xmath6 or @xmath20 .",
    "we obtain the inflaton potential : @xmath57 with    @xmath58    we have introduced the canonically normalized real inflaton field @xmath59 so that we can later use the usual slow - roll equations for real scalar fields .",
    "note that for khler potential coefficients @xmath60 , we expect @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .    as a further simplification , we will only keep terms up to order @xmath64 in the inflaton potential to derive the predictions for inflation : @xmath65 the effects of the higher - order operator @xmath66 are estimated in appendix [ appendix : higherdim ] , and we find that they are usually small .",
    "we therefore have a simple model of inflation with the independent parameters @xmath67 .",
    "this model is simple enough to be solved using robust analytic approximations .",

    "[ fig : potentialshapes ] .",
    "the blue parts of the curve correspond to possible trajectories for non - inverted tribrid inflation , and the red parts correspond to inverted trajectories where the inflaton is rolling towards larger field values .",
    "we will later see that for supersymmetric tribrid inflation , inverted trajectories are not compatible with a waterfall transition .",
    "we will therefore consider non - inverted models , although the slow - roll treatment in section [ sec : slowrollkahler ] can easily be generalized to the inverted case .",
    "we will also see that at about @xmath68 e - folds before the end of inflation , i.e.  at the time where perturbations with wavenumber @xmath69 leave the horizon , @xmath70 has to hold to account for @xmath71 as required by the wmap observations .",

    "<S> we discuss a new class of tribrid inflation models in supergravity , where the shape of the inflaton potential is dominated by effects from the khler potential . </S>",
    "<S> tribrid inflation is a variant of hybrid inflation which is particularly suited for connecting inflation with particle physics , since the inflaton can be a d - flat combination of charged fields from the matter sector . in models of tribrid inflation studied so far , the inflaton potential was dominated by either loop corrections or by mixing effects with the waterfall field ( as in `` pseudosmooth '' tribrid inflation ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the third possibility , namely that tribrid inflation is dominantly driven by effects from higher - dimensional operators of the khler potential . </S>",
    "<S> we specify for which superpotential parameters the new regime is realized and show how it can be experimentally distinguished from the other two ( loop - driven and `` pseudosmooth '' ) regimes .     + stefan antusch@xmath0 and david nolde@xmath1    @xmath1 _ department of physics , university of basel , _    </S>",
