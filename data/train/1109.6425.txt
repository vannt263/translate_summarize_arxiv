    "the electron spin coherence in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically in recent years.@xcite this activity is driven by prospective applications of the electron spin in quantum information processing requiring methods of initialization , manipulation , storage , and readout of spin coherence . a vital problem in this respect concerns the coupling of the electron spin to its environment , deteriorating the spin dynamics .",
    "the strength of this interaction determines the transverse spin relaxation time @xmath1 , limiting coherent state manipulation . in qds",
    "the electron wave function is strongly spatially localized by the three - dimensional confinement potential .",
    "on one hand this leads to discrete energy levels and makes the electron spin weakly susceptible to the main spin relaxation mechanisms in bulk semiconductors related to the spin - orbit interaction.@xcite on the other hand it enhances the fermi contact hyperfine interaction , which therefore is considered as main relaxation mechanism for qd electron spins .",
    "@xcite the hyperfine interaction is controlled by : ( 1 ) the nuclear isotope composition , ( 2 ) the hyperfine coupling constants , ( ii ) the number of lattice nuclei , and ( iv ) the nuclear spin magnitudes .",
    "therefore , a proper choice of the qd semiconductor material may minimize this interaction , potentially prolonging the transverse spin relaxation time . in this",
    "respect ii - vi semiconductors are an interesting alternative to iii - v materials .",
    "for example , in cdse the abundance of nuclear isotopes with nonzero spin is 7.6% for se and 25% for cd only , compared with the 100% for in , ga and as in the widely studied ( in , ga)as dots.@xcite therefore , the electron spin dephasing by the hyperfine interaction should be considerably weaker in cdse dots .",
    "coherent electron spin dynamics was studied by time - resolved faraday rotation for colloidal cdse qds  @xcite and cd(s , se ) qds in semiconductor - doped glasses@xcite , both of wurtzite - type .",
    "longitudinal spin relaxation times of @xmath2  @xmath3s and transverse spin dephasing times @xmath4  ns were reported.@xcite the measured faraday rotation traces show complicated quantum beat patterns due to the qd - anisotropy typical for wurtzite structures ( leading to a complex exciton fine structure ) and also due to the random dot orientation in the ensemble , so that the optical selection rules become undefined .",
    "these factors complicate the theoretical description of coherent spin dynamics in colloidal qds , in addition to the influence of surface states.@xcite    some of these complications become resolved in epitaxially - grown self - assembled qds .",
    "first , the influence of surface states is eliminated .",
    "second , modulation doping allows one to fabricate charged qds with a single resident electron per dot.@xcite the spin dynamics of resident electrons is not limited by radiative exciton recombination as in empty qds .",
    "resident electron spin coherence can be generated via an intermediate trion state , as suggested theoretically@xcite and demonstrated experimentally in ( in , ga)as / gaas qds.@xcite another advantage of self - assembled qds is their well - defined crystallographic orientation on the substrate , from which optical selection rules are established .",
    "also the crystal structure can be controlled by the choice of substrate material , e.g. , grown on a gaas substrate , cdse qds have cubic symmetry instead of wurtzite symmetry , simplifying the exciton fine structure .    in this paper",
    "we report on time - resolved pump - probe kerr rotation ( kr ) studies of the electron spin coherence in _ n_-doped and undoped self - assembled cdse / zn(s , se ) qds with a cubic crystal structure .",
    "we observe long - lived spin beats related to the coherent precession of electron spins about a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the coherence persists over times exceeding the interval between subsequent laser pulses of @xmath513  ns .",
    "analysis of the kr traces as function of magnetic field gives information about dephasing times and @xmath6 factors of the resident qd electrons .",
    "also the temperature dependence of the dephasing time was investigated , and the results are compared to literature data , especially for colloidal wurtzite cdse qds .",
    "the investigated cdse / zn(s , se ) qd multilayer structures were pseudomorphically grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on a gaas : si buffer layer on top of an _",
    "n_-type gaas ( 001 ) substrate .",
    "first , a 1.5  @xmath3m - thick _ n_-type znmgsse : cl wide - gap confining layer ( @xmath7  ev at @xmath8  k ) was deposited to separate the qd region from the gaas buffer .",
    "then , ten periods of cdse qd layers ( each having a nominal thickness of 2.5 ml with a self - assembled dot density of @xmath9  @xmath10 ) were grown , each layer sandwiched between zn(s , se)/znse short - period superlattice ( sl ) barriers with a thickness of 50  nm . the compressive strain induced by the cdse qds",
    "is compensated by the tensile strain intentionally generated in the sl barriers , which provides similar growth conditions for each qd layer .",
    "finally , the entire structure was capped by a 30  nm - thick znmgsse layer .",
    "two structures were fabricated : a reference sample with nominally undoped qds and a sample with _",
    "n_-doped qds . in the _ n_-doped structure , the middle part of each sl barrier with a thickness of 17 nm was doped by cl with a concentration resulting in an electron sheet density of @xmath11  @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that only @xmath12  % of the electrons are transferred to the qds through the undoped 17  nm - thick sl spacers . from these numbers",
    "we expect that the qd ensemble represents mostly a mix of charge - neutral and singly - charged qds , but there may be also a small fraction of doubly or higher charged dots .",
    "the pulsed laser source used in the experiments was an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the laser system generates pulses with a duration of 1.6  ps at a repetition rate of 75.6  mhz , corresponding to 13.2  ns pulse separation .",
    "the photon energy could be tuned in the range @xmath13  ev .",
    "the samples were held in a helium bath cryostat equipped with a superconducting split - coil magnet .",

    "z_-axis ( voigt geometry , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the sample temperature was varied from 1.6 up to 50  k.    in the kr experiment the laser beam was split into a circularly polarized pump and a linearly polarized probe .",
    "both beams were focused on the sample with a spot diameter of @xmath5150  @xmath3 m .",
    "to avoid dynamic nuclear polarization , the helicity of the pump beam was modulated at 50  khz rate using a photoelastic modulator .",
    "the pump pulse excites carriers with spins polarized along the _ z_-axis .",
    "the subsequent coherent spin dynamics in form of larmor precession about @xmath14 is measured by the rotation angle @xmath16 of the polarization plane of the probe . to detect @xmath16 ,",
    "a homodyne technique based on phase - sensitive balanced detection was used.@xcite    the spectrally - resolved recombination dynamics of the optically excited electron - hole pairs could be detected in time - resolved photoluminescence ( trpl ) .",
    "for that purpose the samples were mounted in a helium flow cryostat at @xmath17  k. the pl emission was dispersed by a 0.5  m spectrometer and detected by a synchroscan streak camera with an s20 photocathode .",
    "the overall time resolution of this setup was 15  ps .",

    "the increase in the exciton radiative lifetime with increasing localization energy can be explained by a decrease of the exciton coherence volume in real space and , hence , its increased spread in k space@xcite .",
    "we note here , that in the studied structures the effective barrier energy provided by the superlattice minibands is 2.84  ev , which implies the strong confinement regime for the confined electron and hole wavefunctions .",

    "[ fig:3 ] that the experimental data can be well described by a @xmath44 dependence for @xmath45 t , as shown by the solid line assuming a @xmath46 .",

    "it is larger than the dephasing times reported for colloidal cdse qds of 3  ns at @xmath37  t @xcite , and than @xmath48  ns at @xmath49  t in ( in , ga)as / gaas qds.@xcite    around zero applied magnetic field the spin dephasing in quantum dots is expected to be determined by the electron interaction with the nuclear spin fluctuations at low temperatures . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the electron spin dephasing time due to this interaction can be calculated according ( see appendix for details ) : @xmath50 here the sum runs over all types of nuclear isotopes in the dots , @xmath51 is the number of nuclei in the qd volume , and @xmath52 is the nuclear spin .",
    "@xmath53 is the hyperfine constant , which is taken for a unit cell with two nuclei , and @xmath54 is the probability to find the particular type of nuclear isotope ( see appendix for details ) . using this equation we can evaluate the electron spin dephasing time in cdse dots . to estimate the number of nuclei we used the geometrical volume of the dot , assumed to be of cylindrical shape ( qd diameter of @xmath55  nm and height of @xmath56  nm ) , and used hyperfine coupling constants of -37.4  @xmath3ev , -39.1  @xmath3ev , and 33.6  @xmath3ev for the stable isotopes of @xmath57cd , @xmath58cd , and @xmath59se , respectively , each having spin 1/2 ( see table  i and appendix for details ) .",
    "this gives a @xmath51 in the range from 630 to 2090 nuclei and leads to a dephasing time of @xmath60  ns depending on the qd size .",
    "for better agreement with the measured 5.6  ns we have to assume that either the qd volume is an order of magnitude larger , which can be achieved by assuming , for example , a height of 2.1  nm and a diameter of 17  nm or a height of 4  nm and a diameter of 12  nm ( see appendix ) , or the interaction with the nuclei is weaker , e.g. , due to deviation of the real situation from the modeled one in the exchange - box approximation .    if the qds would have the same size , the nuclei - induced spin dephasing would be much more efficient in gaas and ( in , ga)as dots compared to cdse dots , because the nuclear spins in iii - v dots are considerably larger : 9/2 for in and 3/2 for as and ga compared to 1/2 for cd and se . a comparison of the relevant parameters for cdse and ( in",
    ", ga)as dots is given in table  i. in addition , @xmath61 scales inversely with the number of nuclei with non - zero spin .",
    "the abundance of such isotopes in ( in , ga)as is 100% for all nuclear species , while it is only 25% for cd and 7.6% for se .",
    "this shortens the dephasing time in iii - v qds further . as a result , for dots of the same size one would expect the electron spin dephasing times to be about 10 times shorter in ( in , ga)as than in cdse dots , see fig .",
    "in practice , ( in , ga)as / gaas qds grown by molecular - beam epitaxy have , however , considerably larger sizes than cdse self - organized dots .",
    "this reduces the difference in the number of non - zero spin nuclei , and therefore also the difference in dephasing times .",
    "it is important to mention though that numerical estimates based on eq .",
    "( [ t_nucl ] ) give smaller values of @xmath30 than experimentally observed for both cdse and ( in , ga)as qds . most probably this is related to the limitations of the used approach , which is based on the `` box model '' assuming a constant density of the electron envelope wave function at all nuclear sites within the qd .",
    "also possible effects of nuclear polarization , e.g. nuclear frequency focusing @xcite , are beyond the model consideration .",
    "accounting for these effects would require detailed information on the qd shape and substantial computational efforts , both of which go beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we examined also the temperature effect on the kr signal .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows how the dephasing time is changing with increasing temperature in a weak magnetic field of @xmath37  t. the @xmath36 time of the resident electrons decreases monotonically from 5.6  ns at @xmath62  k ( @xmath63  mev ) down to 0.8  ns at @xmath64  k ( @xmath65  mev ) .",
