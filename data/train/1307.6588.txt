    "it is now recognized that the physical processes by which galaxies accrete , expel and recycle baryons are of central importance to galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the current theoretical paradigm emphasizes a ` cold - mode ' of accretion @xcite that fuels the high star formation rates ( sfrs ) observed in the early universe .",
    "this cool ( @xmath7  k ) , accreting gas is predicted to produce observable signatures as high column density , low metallicity absorption systems @xcite in the spectra of background sightlines which pass through the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) of high redshift galaxies .",
    "however , there is little direct observational evidence for the cold - accretion phenomenon . instead",
    ", metal - enriched outflows are commonly observed from @xmath8 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) as blue - shifted absorption features in the galaxies spectra @xcite .",
    "energetic ` feedback ' in some form is required to regulate star formation in numerical simulations , which is necessary to match observables such as the stellar luminosity function @xcite and galaxy rotation curves @xcite , but the distances to which these outflows travel and their energetics are poorly constrained .",
    "precise measurements of the enrichment and physical conditions of the cgm are thus crucial both to test the cold accretion picture and to characterize how far outflowing material travels .    the best technique currently available to measure metallicities is by analyzing individual absorption line profiles from gas in the cgm . this technique has been used extensively to measure metallicities of high column density systems over a broad redshift range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the relationship between the absorbing gas and galaxies in these studies is often unclear , making them difficult to interpret in the context of galaxy formation models .",
    "the cold accretion phenomenon may persist to lower redshifts in lower mass haloes , and several observational studies have discovered low metallicity ( @xmath9 ) absorbers in the neighbourhood of @xmath10 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but measurements of cgm enrichment near vigorously star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 , during the peak of the cosmic sfr and where cold accretion is predicted to occur over a wide range of halo masses , have proven to be much more challenging .    in this letter",
    "we analyze an echelle spectrum of a background qso at an impact parameter of 58  kpc from a foreground star - forming galaxy discovered by @xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ] .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath14 ) , high - resolution ( @xmath15 ) spectrum combined with the rare detection of the deuterium isotope of hydrogen , enable us to effectively disentangle absorption produced by neutral , metal poor gas from that of more highly ionized , metal enriched gas .",
    "the deuterium detection allows us to precisely measure the metallicity of a metal - poor cgm absorber , and we show that it exhibits many of the characteristics expected for cold - mode accretion .",
    "the bright background qso  j1444535@xmath16291905 ( @xmath17 ) at redshift @xmath18 has been observed using the hires echelle spectrograph on keck by several groups from 1995 to 2009 .",
    "we obtained the spectra from the keck archive and reduced them with makee .",
    "the final combined spectrum covers wavelength ranges @xmath19 to @xmath20    ( resolution @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 to @xmath23    ( resolution @xmath24 ) .",

    "the redshift uncertainty is @xmath27  km  s@xmath28 , which arises when rest - frame uv transitions such as @xmath29  emission and metal absorption are used to determine the intrinsic redshift @xcite .",
    "rudie et al . do not publish further details on the galaxy , but such galaxies typically have a dust - extinction corrected sfr of 30  @xmath30  @xcite , a gas - phase ism metallicity of @xmath31 @xcite and a dark matter halo mass @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this halo mass implies a virial radius of 75  kpc @xcite , and thus the projected separation from the background qso sightline is comparable to the virial radius .",
    "we note that @xcite indicates a second star - forming galaxy is present at @xmath33  kpc within @xmath34 of the first galaxy , but does not publish the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "we adopt @xmath0kpc for our analysis , but our conclusions remain unchanged if a second galaxy exists at an even closer impact parameter .",
    "the hires spectrum reveals a sub - damped absorption system , originally discovered by @xcite , that is coincident with the redshift of the foreground galaxy .",
    "our voigt profile fit to the damping wings implies a total neutral hydrogen column density @xmath35  @xmath36  ( figure  [ f_hi ] , top ) .",
    "absorption from low and high - ionization ionic metal line transitions is present in 16 distinct components spread across @xmath37 km  s@xmath28  ( figure  [ f_metals ] ) .",
    "the total @xmath38 is well - constrained , but as we will demonstrate , the metallicity varies by an order of magnitude among the components .",
    "fortuitously , we can also constrain @xmath39  for several _ individual _ components .",
    "we measured column densities in the system by fitting voigt profiles with vpfit , and by using the apparent optical depth ( aod , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) method .",
    "voigt profile fits assess the degree to which a single kinematic model can explain all the observed absorption : low - ionization transitions were used to define the main velocity components , and we found that a single velocity structure matches all the low - ionization species well .",
    "the resulting models are shown in figures  [ f_hi ] & [ f_metals ] .",
    "the higher ionization transitions ,  and  do not follow the same velocity structure as the low - ions , indicating there is likely a contribution from a hotter or more highly - ionized phase . similar offsets between low and high - ions have been observed in other high-@xmath40 absorbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ t_one ] gives voigt profile parameters and our adopted column densities for each component .",
    "our voigt profile fits to both the high - ions and low - ions show no evidence for partial covering or unresolved saturated components .         +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      we have used two independent methods to show that the metallicity of the d component is @xmath41 solar : @xmath42 using o@xmath43h@xmath44 , and @xmath45 from the cloudy models using all the metal transitions except oi .",
    "the width of the  line requires a gas temperature @xmath5  k , conservatively assuming thermal broadening such that @xmath46 . from the models we find @xmath47 , which implies that h is @xmath48 neutral ( @xmath49 ) and has a temperature of @xmath50  k , in agreement with @xmath51 ( ) .",
    "[ fe / o ]  @xmath52 , therefore there is no evidence for strong dust depletion , as is expected from the low metallicity . the maximum @xmath53 permitted ( @xmath54 )",
    "corresponds to a neutral fraction of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the magnitude of the ionizing spectrum at 912   .",
    "this implies a cloud thickness @xmath58  kpc .",
    "in contrast to the d component , partial lls 1 and 2 are metal enriched and highly ionized .",
    "both lls have similar conditions : the models yield @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 , implying that less than @xmath62 of h is neutral ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "using a starburst - dominated ionizing spectrum allows a lower @xmath64 , but results in a 0.6 - 0.7 dex disagreement between the observed and predicted @xmath65 .",
    "therefore we prefer the uvb - only models , but our main conclusions are unchanged if we were to instead use a starburst - dominated spectrum .",
    "a further difference between the d and partial lls components is the presence of absorption from higher ionization gas ( , , ) over the same velocity range as the low - ions .",
    "while some  components align with the low - ions , overall the high - ions have a different velocity structure , and are much stronger than expected from our photoionization modelling of the low - ions .",
    "very broad components are also present in  ( see figure  [ f_metals ] ) .",
    "thus these high - ions may trace another gas phase that is shock - heated and collisionally ionized ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we calculate [ o / h ] for the entire system , including all low - ion components , assuming @xmath66  is associated with the bulk of the @xmath67  and that ionization corrections are negligible .",
    "this gives [ o / h]@xmath68 .",
    "therefore all the oi  components , spanning @xmath69 , must have a metallicity similar to the d component .",
    "figure  [ f_met ] shows the current state of gas - absorption metallicities measured around @xmath11 lbgs . enriched gas with @xmath70 is found in the partial lls component in this paper at @xmath0  kpc , for the galaxy - absorber pair at @xmath71  kpc from @xcite , and in the ism of the gravitationally - lensed lbg cb58 @xcite , shown at @xmath72  kpc .",

    "the metallicity of the d component is more than an order of magnitude lower than the typical ism metallicity of lbgs @xcite , indicating that this gas has not been recently stripped or ejected in a wind from the galaxy .",
    "could it be produced by a cold - mode accretion flow ?",

    "] , has a high column density ( @xmath77 ) , low metallicity ( @xmath78 ) , cool temperature ( @xmath79k ) , and characteristic size @xmath80 kpc , which are all properties of inflowing streams expected from simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite predict that accreting streams have high angular momentum and often co - rotate with the galaxy s disk , producing offsets of up to @xmath81  km  s@xmath28  from the systemic galaxy redshift .",
    "the d component is at @xmath82  km  s@xmath28  from the nearby galaxy , which is compatible with such an offset .",
    "all of the oi  components in the absorber , covering a velocity range of @xmath83  km  s@xmath28 , also have low metallicities .",
    "such velocity separations are seen by stewart et al . when a sightline intersects multiple accreting streams .",
    "therefore , in light of all the evidence above , we believe that this absorber represents the best existing candidate for a cold - mode accretion flow at high redshift .",
    "the cgm around this galaxy is highly inhomogeneous : the d and partial lls components have metallicities that differ by at least a factor of ten .",
    "these different metallicities are reminiscent of the bimodal metal distribution seen in @xmath10 lyman limit systems @xcite , which lehner et al .",
    "argue results from physically distinct processes : metal - poor accreting gas , and metal - enriched gas stripped from galaxies or ejected in large - scale winds . indeed , the two components in this system show further differences besides the metallicity : the d component is neutral and has very weak high - ion absorption , whereas the partial llss are highly ionized and have strong associated high - ions .",
    "these high - ions are not produced by the same ionizing spectrum that can reproduce the low - ions , and they may be caused by shock - heated , collisionally - ionized gas that is expected in a supernovae - driven outflowing wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent with the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite , which indicate that enriched outflowing and metal - poor inflowing phases of the cgm are mixed kinematically .",
    "if such a bimodality is common , as is implied by analyses of other @xmath84 sub - dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has fundamental implications for interpreting observations of the cgm . using the @xmath85  values inferred from photoionization modelling and the component metallicities ,",
    "we conclude that the highly ionized partial llss contain _ most _ of the total metal mass in this system , significantly more than the low - metallicity component which dominates the total  absorption .",
    "consider the case of this same system observed at a lower resolution , or of a composite spectrum which averages the absorption of many such systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the metal absorption for individual components can no longer be matched to their respective , and we must measure the metallicity for the system as a whole .",
    "we showed in  [ s_phys ] that doing this results in a low metallicity , [ o / h]@xmath86 .",
    "thus the high metallicity partial llss would escape detection .",
    "an even more interesting case to consider is if the low - metallicity component had been more highly ionized , which would occur if it was illuminated by a stronger radiation field , or if it had a lower total @xmath85 , reducing its ability to self - shield . to explore this case we ran photoionization models for a range of @xmath53 values , using @xmath87 , and with other properties identical to the d component .",
    "these show that for a total @xmath88 , characteristic of cold streams @xcite , the strongest low - ion metal transition lying outside the @xmath29  forest ,  @xmath89 , always has a column density @xmath90 .",
    "such a weak line approaches the detection limit even for echelle spectra . in low - resolution or composite spectra it would be easily swamped by stronger absorption from any kinematically nearby , metal - enriched gas , and the total metallicity inferred for the system would be dominated by metal - rich components",
    ". therefore a large reservoir of metal - poor gas may be missed by existing studies of the @xmath11 cgm that use only low - resolution or composite spectra .",
    "further studies employing high - resolution spectra of background qsos near foreground galaxies are essential to accurately assess the metal content of the cgm .    by creating a large sample of similar absorption systems where metallicity measurements can be made at small impact parameters , we can realise the exciting possibility of mapping the enrichment distribution of the high - redshift cgm .",
