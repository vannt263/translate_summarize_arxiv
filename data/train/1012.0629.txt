    "dense quark matter has been an exciting topic since quark color superconducting phases could form the ground states of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at asymptotically high baryon density ( equivalently , the quark chemical potential @xmath0 is extremely large ) and low temperature , the ground state of three - flavor matter is believed to correspond to the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite .",
    "the appearance of cfl is completely due to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) mechanism , i. e. the weak attraction between quarks leads to that quarks participate in the pairing on the fermi surface . in the cfl phase , the original qcd symmetry @xmath1 is broken down to the diagonal subgroup @xmath2 @xcite , similar as the chiral breaking pattern in the low - energy qcd . as the consequence of this symmetry breaking pattern ,",
    "there exist the goldstone - type modes in this phase , similar as the spectrum of the lowest - lying pseudo - goldstone meson in hadronic matter . based on these similarities",
    "mainly , a conjecture of the continuity between hadronic matter and quark matter was supposed by schfer and f. wilczek @xcite . until now",
    ", a fully understanding of the qcd phase diagram at finite @xmath0 ( including the hadron - quark transition ) is immature . in recent years",
    ", the detailed phase structure of quark color superconductivity has been widely studied ( see , e. g. refs.@xcite,@xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "generally , candidates of the second - densest ground state of qcd include the less - symmetric bcs phases as well as the non - bcs phases ( like a crystalline superconducting phase ) .",
    "they might become energetically more favorable than cfl in the densities relevant for compact star phenomenology .",
    "qualitatively , emergence of a less - symmetric bcs phases could be understood as a phenomenon near the fermi surfaces of quarks . in the typical bcs region",
    ", effects of the current quark masses , charge neutrality and @xmath3-equilibrium turn on mismatches between the fermi momenta for different quark species , which makes the less - symmetric bcs phases possible . in the situation with not - very - large @xmath0 , in particular ,",

    "bec displays a strong correlation in the coordinate space whereas bcs does a strong correlation in the momentum space .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover physics in the scope of quark color superconductivity has attracted much attention and been investigated by a variety of qcd models @xcite . for the strong - coupling regime , people usually apply the phenomenological models such as the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with both quark - antiquark and quark - quark interactions . for instance",
    ", the crossover physics was studied in such a three - flavor njl model @xcite . as the result , the bec occurrence was predicted for low @xmath0 in the situation with the realistic current masses ( i. e. @xmath10mev and @xmath11mev ) . by incorporating the axial anomaly ( as an interplay between the quark - antiquark and diquark condensates ) ,",
    "it has been argued more recently that the bec occurrence might be enhanced @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that bec may be realized at relatively large @xmath0 in the situation with equal masses @xmath12 .    in the present work ,",

    ", we will consider the cfl phase near the flavor @xmath19 limit , where @xmath46 is small enough with respect to the constituent quark masses . in this case , it is safe to assume that there exist the approximately same mean - field values of chiral condensate for three flavors . to distinguish from @xmath20 defined in the ideal cfl phase",
    ", the common value is regarded as the average quark mass @xmath14 . at the same time , effect of a small",
    "@xmath46 needs to be considered by taking into account difference of effective chemical potentials for the light and strange flavors .",

    "equivalently , the chemical potentials for the two kinds of diquarks read @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the cfl phase .    with the help of @xmath14 and @xmath51 , it is not necessary to require that the formalisms of dispersion laws eq.([e+- ] ) are changed ( since the common constituent mass has been assumed ) . for the light - flavor channel related with the gap @xmath36 ,",
    "the chiral - limit result @xmath52 should be replaced by @xmath53 in the @xmath37 channel , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "instead of incorporating the flavor asymmetry into the matrix consisting of quark masses , we concern the main influence of a small @xmath6 on the formal description of cfl . in the typical bcs region",
    ", it is well known that flavor asymmetry can be attributed to the mismatches between effective chemical potentials for different flavors . when @xmath7 , a small @xmath6 ( exactly @xmath58 ) is associated with the strangeness effective chemical potential .",
    "physically , its introduction enhances the strangeness content and reduces the number density of the paired quarks involving strange flavor .",
    "provided that the changed density induced by @xmath58 is @xmath59 , the density for the paired quarks in the @xmath37 channel should be decreased .",
    "formally , it can be expressed by @xmath60 rather than @xmath44 given in eq.([rho ] ) . at the given @xmath0",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the total quark density is conserved . in the cfl phase where all the quark species participate in the bcs pairing",
    ", @xmath59 corresponds to the number - density transfer between the two of pairing channels . in this sense ,",
    "the density of light - flavor paired quarks ( in the @xmath36 channel ) becomes @xmath61 correspondingly .",
    "before we proceed , several points are worth being notified .",
    "first , we have ignored the effects of electric / color neutrality of quark matter although they might be connected with the flavor asymmetry in the cfl phase ( see , e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gapless phenomenon is ignored for simplicity although it was found to be triggered by @xmath15 mainly @xcite .",
    "secondly , our concerned phase is not the conventional cfl phase , but the cfl - type superconducting phase near the flavor @xmath19 limit ( the chiral limit ) . as mentioned in introduction , the condition @xmath7 ( exactly , @xmath16 and @xmath62 )",
    "is satisfied formally and the effect of @xmath58 is manifested in a similar way .",
    "moreover , it is important to notice that the bcs - bec crossover is not a phase transition in the proper sense . in vicinity of the crossover point",
    ", there exists a smooth behavior in the physical quantities like the number densities .",
    "therefore , the physical influences in the bcs region like eqs.([rho12 ] ) and ( [ rho3 ] ) can be extrapolated to the possible bec region .    keeping it in mind that @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to the conjugate variables to the densities @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively , we transform the physical influences into the expressions of average chemical potentials . in the presence of @xmath0 ,",
    "the grand - canonical potential could be generally written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the hamiltonian operator and @xmath67 does the particle number operator .",
    "in the njl - type models with the quark - antiquark and diquark interactions , one usually employs the nambu - gorkov propagator of quarks to derive the thermodynamic potential for the color superconducting phase . in the ideal cfl phase",
    ", it has been shown that the quark - antiquark interacting term ( chiral condensate ) and the external - source term ( which is related with @xmath0 ) enter the diagonal components of the inverse propagator , while the diquark interacting term ( color condensate ) enters the off - diagonal components @xcite .",
    "this is why the dispersion relations of paired quarks and the cfl thermodynamic potential can be obtained analytically in the flavor @xmath19 limit .",
    "now we turn to the situation near the @xmath19 limit .",
    "since the common value of chiral condensate has been assumed , there should not exist difference in the quark - antiquark interacting terms for three flavors .",
    "also , there is not the mixing between the diquark interacting terms and the external - source term .",
    "therefore , introducing the two densities @xmath63 and @xmath64 does not lead to complications in the matrix structure of the inverse propagator and the resulting dispersion relations . in this sense , we replace the term @xmath68 in eq.([omega ] ) by the term @xmath69 , namely @xmath70 at the mean - field level . if the two species of paired quarks are independent , eq.([murho ] ) may be simplified as @xmath71 and @xmath72    in analogy with the ideal case , the cfl thermodynamic potential is written as @xmath73 near the flavor @xmath19 limit , which returns to eq.([icfl ] ) when @xmath59 vanishes .",
    "the common quark masses @xmath14 is deviated from @xmath20 ( which is obtained in the ideal phase ) and needs to be recalculated by minimizing eq.([cfl ] ) .",
    "similarly , the gaps @xmath37 and @xmath36 are given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath59 used in eqs.([murho12 ] ) and ( [ murho3 ] ) could not be yielded from the above - given scheme itself .",
    "it has been widely discussed in the literature that there exist some less - symmetric bcs phases as possible candidates of the second - densest ground state of quark matter . in the present work ,",
    "we only consider the cfl phase where the pseudo goldstone excitations become condensed .",
    "since the @xmath76 mode is the strange - involved one ( as the usual @xmath76 meson ) , a small @xmath6 triggers the @xmath76-mode condensation in the cfl environment ( the so - called cfl@xmath76 phase ) . as usual",
    ", @xmath76 has the chemical potential @xmath77 because of the chemical equilibrium . based on the chiral effective lagrangian for goldstone modes , the hypercharge density from the @xmath76 condensation reads @xcite @xmath78 where the in - cfl - medium decay constant @xmath79 was obtained in the weak - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "in the situation with realistic @xmath80 and medium @xmath0 , the condensation may be weaken and the value of @xmath81 might become no longer correct @xcite . also , @xmath76 condensation is possible to be excluded because of the instanton effect @xcite .",
    "as long as cfl@xmath76 emerge , eq.([rhok ] ) accounts for the change in the density of the strange - flavor quasi particles . in the following calculations",
    ", we will identify eq.([rhok ] ) with the density change @xmath59 introduced above .",
    "another simplification in the calculations involves the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in principle , the average chemical potentials need to be solved from eqs.([murho12 ] ) and ( [ murho3 ] ) as well as the gap equations self - consistently . if ignoring the difference of @xmath82 from the ideal result @xmath83 , eq.([murho12 ] ) leads to an approximate relation @xmath84 in the strange - flavor - involved channel related with @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath48 is obtained by @xmath85 in the light - flavor channel related with @xmath36 .",
    "because of the negative values of @xmath86 , it is obvious that @xmath47 is larger than @xmath0 whereas @xmath48 is smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this is a simple but nontrivial result which might be relevant for the onset of bound diquark states .",
    "as color - flavor unlocking takes place , it is usually believed that the so - called 2sc phase emerges .",
    "the 2sc thermodynamic potential can be expressed analytically even though the current quark masses are introduced explicitly @xcite .",
    "different from the above description for cfl , the constituent quark masses @xmath87 and @xmath88 need to be introduced on the 2sc side . because only the light - flavor channel participates in pairing , the dispersion relation for the paired quarks ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) has the similar form as eq.([e+- ] ) . correspondingly , the thermodynamic - potential contribution is written as @xmath91 formally , where @xmath92 denotes the pairing gap on the 2sc side .",

    "]    ignoring the 2sc electric / color neutrality and the @xmath3 equilibrium , we simply treat color - flavor unlocking as a first - order phase transition between cfl and 2sc .",
    "the critical chemical potential @xmath101 for the unlocking transition may be obtained from the gibbs s pressure equilibrium .",
    "now we adopt the model parameters used in ref.@xcite , i. e. the momentum cutoff @xmath102mev and the quark - antiquark coupling constant @xmath103gev@xmath104 and treat the diquark coupling `` constant '' @xmath29 as a free parameter .",
    "based on the above - defined cfl and 2sc phase , the numerical calculation shows that the coupling - constant ratio @xmath105 has an obvious influence on the locations of @xmath101 . with a commonly used value in literatures like @xmath106",
    ", the unlocking transition is found to occur at @xmath107mev .",
    "as the coupling - constant ratio increases , the critical value is found to be strongly suppressed .",
    "when the value of @xmath105 becomes larger than @xmath108 , the solution of @xmath101 is shown to be unrealistically small ( see fig .",
    "1 , where the current mass @xmath109mev is considered ) . to understand this result , it is worthy being noticed that cfl is calculated in a different way from the literature .",
    "due to the ( almost ) same dispersion behaviors for all the paired quarks , it is natural that the cfl existence is welcome when a stronger attractive interaction between quarks is introduced .    to this end",
    ", one may doubt the validity of @xmath110mev given in fig .",
    "1 . for such a small chemical potential , according to the current knowledge of qcd phase diagram , there seems to exist the confined hadronic phase rather than the quark color superconducting phase . keeping it in mind that our concerned three - flavor superconductor is a fictional phase being valid near the flavor @xmath19 limit",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath0 could not be identified with the baryon density of strongly interacting matter in realistic situations .",
    "in addition , strong coupling strength like @xmath111 had been used for studying quark superconducting phase and the bec possibility in it @xcite . there , exploring the bcs - bec crossover physics was actually limited in the scope of strong - coupling quark superconductivity and the phase transition to the confined hadronic phase was not incorporated yet . as a theoretical interest , we will examine the bcs - bec crossover physics in the strong - coupling quark superconductor ( including cfl and 2sc ) all through the present work .",
    "according to the energy of quark quasiparticle excitations @xmath25 given in eqs.([e+-3 ] ) and ( [ e+-12 ] ) , the minimum of the dispersion relation is located at zero momentum when the average mass @xmath14 is larger than the average chemical potential @xmath51 .",
    "this indicates that cooper pairing is no longer restricted to a vicinity of the fermi surface . for the relativistic fermion gas ,",
    "thus , the necessary condition of onsets of bound diquark states and their bec is written as @xmath112 also , eq.([bec ] ) might be understood from the viewpoint that diquark states decay into a pair of quarks .",
    "the threshold energy for this decay process is expressed as @xmath113 since the excitation energy of a quark is @xmath114 at zero momentum . to ensure stability of the diquark system",

    "the short dashed ( red ) line denotes the crossover from 2sc to 2sc+bec . ]",
    "finally , we adopt the coupling - constant ratio @xmath143 to investigate other possibilities of bcs - bec crossover .",
    "besides the cfl - cfl+bec crossover occurred for very small @xmath6 , a bcs - bec crossover becomes possible in the unlocked environment .",
    "with such a parameter @xmath144 , the solutions of @xmath101 and @xmath135 become comparable for large @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 is realistically large , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , it is not cfl+bec but 2sc to behave as an intergrade phase .",
    "actually this result is same as the previous one obtained in ref.@xcite , where cfl was calculated nonanalytically in the situation with the realistic current masses .",
    "once the smaller ratios are chosen , the solutions of @xmath101 become large systematically ( see fig .",
    "thus , @xmath134 is usually not satisfied and cfl+bec does no longer emerge . within the njl framework",
    ", it has been noticed that bose - einstein condensation of diquarks occurs only if the coupling constant @xmath29 is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "within a three - flavor njl model , an approximate description for the color - flavor - locked - type bcs phase has been proposed near the flavor @xmath19 limit ( near the chiral limit ) . assuming that analytical dispersion relations are valid for all the diquark species , the common constituent quark mass @xmath14 is used while the physical influence from a small @xmath6 is attributed to difference of the average chemical potentials @xmath47 and @xmath48 . at mean - field level , the existence of light - flavor diquark bec phase becomes inevitable as long as the attractive interaction between quarks is strong enough .",
    "in particular , a possibility was reported that light - flavor diquark bec phase emerges in the environment where the color - flavor - locked pairing pattern remains .",
    "it is a consequence of generalizing three - flavor superconductor to the case of arbitrary small values of @xmath6 and/or relatively low values of @xmath0 . in spite of that cfl+bec",
    "is limited in a very narrow regime , this result enriches the phase structure of strong - interacting matter and might be helpful for better understanding quark superconductor in the theoretical sense .",
    "if taking into account other effects such as the interplay between chiral and diquark condensates , it may be expected that existence of light - flavor bec phase is enhanced more or less . in ref.@xcite , h. abuki , g. baym , t. hatsuda and n. yamamoto introduced the coupling between chiral and diquark condensates through the axial anomaly and found that the bec regime is enlarged . while finishing our paper , we learned that a more recent study was done by h. basler and m. buballa @xcite .",
    "there , the possibility of cfl+bec ( called as cfl@xmath145 ) was reported in a three - flavor njl model with the axial anomaly . due to the anomaly effects ,",
    "also , they found that the 2sc pairing could be still favored even for small current masses .",
    "if so , it is plausible that cfl+bec always behave as an intergrade phase which emerges before 2sc+bec .",
    "of course , comparison with the results of refs.@xcite requires going beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "this is worth being further examined .",
    "finally , we stress again that the present description for three - flavor superconductor makes sense only when the flavor @xmath19 symmetry holds approximately . to make the results more reliable , it is important to take into account effects of color / electric chemical potentials , color / electric neutralities of quark matter as well as possible gapless phenomenon . in this case",
    ", the physical influences caused by explicitly chiral breaking can not be simply attributed to a difference of the light- and strange - flavor densities .",
    "instead , one should derive the average chemical potentials @xmath51 from the fermi - momentum mismatches induced by all the effects . in the realistic situations",
    ", there may exist variants of two - flavor superconductor ( like the 2scsu phase with only @xmath146 nonzero and the 2scds phase with only @xmath147 ) and non - bcs superconductor . in this case ,",
    "color - flavor unlocking should be no longer realized by an ordinary cfl-2sc transition . in the further investigation , a more systematic analysis on the bec occurrence",
    "is needed in view of the above considerations .",
