    "there is a long history of theoretical efforts to place the study of the ly@xmath0 forest within the framework of cosmological structure formation theories ( doroshkevich & shandarin 1977 ; rees 1986 ; bond , szalay & silk 1988 ; mcgill 1990 ; bi , brner & chu 1992 ) .",
    "recent work making use of numerical simulations has greatly advanced our understanding in this direction ( @xcite ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( see also bi , ge & fang 1995 . for a linear theory calculation ) .",
    "the emerging picture is that it is possible to account for all the observed properties of the ly@xmath0 forest ( with column densities less than about @xmath13 ) by assuming it originates from the small scale structure , including the network of filaments , pancakes and mild density fluctuations , which arises naturally in hierarchical clustering cosmological models ( @xcite ) .",
    "a commonly used statistic to characterize the forest is its column density distribution , the number of absorption lines per unit neutral hydrogen column density per unit redshift as a function of column density .",
    "other useful statistics include line - line correlations and the distributions of @xmath14-values and equivalent widths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there have also been proposals of new statistical tools ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( see @xcite for a general overview of the statistical issues concerning quasar absorption systems . )",
    "we focus our attention on the column density distribution in the present work .",
    "one of the most striking features of the observed column density distribution of quasar absorption systems is that it can be approximated by a single power law that extends over many orders of magnitude .",
    "this was emphasized by tytler ( 1987 ) , among others , who found that in the range @xmath15 , the distribution was reasonably well represented by a power law , @xmath16 with @xmath17",
    ". however , there exists evidence of at least one break .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there is a deficit of absorption systems somewhere in the column density range @xmath18 to @xmath19 compared to a power - law extrapolation of the distribution from lower column densities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for reasons that have to do with the nature of the approximations that we make ( sec .",
    "[ rov ] ) , we focus our attention on absorption systems with column densities in the range @xmath20 .",
    "hu et al . (",
    "1995 ) obtained @xmath21 with a @xmath22 confidence range of @xmath23 in the column density range @xmath24 .",
    "( 1996 ) found the same best - fit @xmath25 for the same range of column densities .",
    "an obvious ultimate goal of recent theoretical work on the ly@xmath0 forest is to constrain theories of structure formation .",
    "the natural question is : what determines the normalization and slope of the column density distribution ?",
    "what are the major determining factors , in addition to the usual parameters specified by a given cosmological model ? to answer these questions , another question has to be addressed : what are the analytical and/or computational tools necessary to make accurate predictions for the column density distribution , given all the required parameters ?",
    "accordingly , the present work can be divided into three parts , where the tools are developed , the factors that influence the column density distribution are analyzed and one application to a class of cosmological models is discussed .",
    "numerical hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) provide the most obvious tools to study the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "computational costs , however , prevent one from testing extensively several cosmological models .",
    "we show in this paper that the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ) , with appropriate smoothing , is an efficient and accurate alternative ( see also doroshkevich & shandarin 1977 ) .",
    "our basic assumption is that the part of the ly@xmath0 forest with column densities less than about @xmath26 arises mostly from regions which are slightly overdense ( overdensity @xmath27 ) or even underdense and which have not undergone orbit - crossing .",
    "the zeldovich approximation can then be coupled with the equations governing the thermal and ionization states of the gas to yield accurate predictions for the density of neutral hydrogen and the peculiar velocity as a function of position .",
    "absorption spectra are then generated and analyzed .",
    "basic expressions for the absorption optical depth are presented in sec .",
    "[ fgp ] and the approximations that go into its computation are discussed in sec .",
    "[ ingr ] .    given an absorption spectrum ,",
    "the column density distribution depends on the method of identifying lines and assigning column densities .",
    "this is discussed in sec .",
    "[ licdd ] .",
    "we investigate the effects of peculiar velocities on the column density distribution , using a method described by miralda - escud ( 1996 ) .",
    "we find that although peculiar velocities can strongly influence the shapes of absorption profiles , they play a relatively minor role in determining the column density distribution .",
    "the various interesting effects of peculiar velocities are discussed in sec .",
    "motivated by this finding , a very different way of assigning column densities is introduced in sec .",
    "[ dpa ] , in which no absorption spectrum needs to be generated . in the absence of peculiar velocities , there is a one - to - one correspondence between density peaks in real space ( if they are separated by a distance larger than a minimum corresponding to the thermal broadening width ) and minima of transmission ( maxima in absorption ) in the observed spectrum . under such conditions",
    ", we can simply associate each density peak in real space with an absorption line and assign a column density to each based on the height and curvature of the peak .",
    "the column density distribution is then a statistic of density peaks in real space .",
    "we apply this procedure ( we call it the density - peak - anstz ) to the density field predicted by the truncated zeldovich approximation and test the result against that of a full hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the column density distribution obtained in this way is compared to that obtained from the hydrodynamic simulation using the voigt - profile - fitting - technique , which is the line - identification method most widely used .",
    "the level of agreement is found to be excellent . in sec .",
    "[ rov ] , we discuss the range of parameters in which our computed column density distribution is expected to be reliable .",
    "armed with the right tools , we turn our attention to the second question : what factors determine the column density distribution ?",
    "they can be divided into two categories .",
    "one has to do with properties of the intergalactic medium , including its temperature , the equation of state ( or temperature - density relation , which we will use interchangeably ; see hui & gnedin 1996 ) , the ionizing radiation intensity and the baryon density .",
    "uncertainties in all of them have to be taken into account before one can meaningfully confront theories with observations .",
    "we distinguish between the factors that mostly affect the normalization of the column density distribution and those that mostly affect its slope .",
    "it is found that the temperature - density relation ( weakly ) affects the slope while the rest of the above factors influences the normalization .",
    "it is also emphasized that the temperature and the equation of state depend on the reionization history of the universe ( a fuller discussion of this point and related topics will be given in a separate paper ) .",
    "the second set of factors affecting the column density distribution has to do with the specific cosmological model , namely the normalization and shape of the corresponding power spectrum .",
    "we study a few variants of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model in sec.[slopecd ] for this purpose .",
    "it is found that the amplitude and slope of the linear power spectrum on comoving scales of around @xmath28 to @xmath29 are the most important factors in determining the slope of the column density distribution ( the equation of state also has a weak effect on it ) .",
    "decreasing the amplitude and/or steepening the slope of the power spectrum tends to steepen the distribution in the column density range about @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "we introduce an expression relating the slope of the column density distribution to the equation of state and properties of the power spectrum on small scales .",
    "we then study a class of cold plus hot dark matter ( chdm ) models in sec .",
    "[ mdm ] , making use of the insights gained in sec .",
    "[ cdm ] and sec .",
    "[ slopecd ] .",
    "the @xmath32 ( density parameter in neutrino ) models have steeper column density distributions compared to those with @xmath33 because they have less power on the relevant scales .",
    "in particular , the low hubble constant ( @xmath34 ) @xmath32 models predict slopes that are steeper than the observed one for most of the parameter - space specifying the properties of the intergalactic medium . only for equations of state that are close to isothermal can the two be made consistent with each other .",
    "we emphasize however that a more detailed comparison between the models and observations , taking fully into account instrumental noise and biases of the line - identification method(s ) , is necessary before one can firmly reject any model .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ gpconc ] .",
    "it is appropriate that we mention here two recent pieces of work along similar lines as described above , but using a different dynamical approximation , namely the lognormal approximation : bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) and gnedin & hui ( 1996 ) .",
    "the former , in particular , contains a very comprehensive and careful analysis of the many different observational properties of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "one strong point of their analysis is that they tested their method using vpfit , a spectral analysis routine that is commonly used by observers .",
    "we will discuss the predictions for the column density distribution by the lognormal and the zeldovich approximations in sec .",
    "[ dpa ] .    in our notation ,",
    "bold faced letters are reserved for three - dimensional vectors .",
    "the symbols @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the three - dimensional peculiar velocity and comoving position while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are their counterparts along the line of sight of interest .",
    "standard symbols are used for cosmological parameters : @xmath39 for the hubble constant as a function of @xmath40 , @xmath41 for the hubble constant today , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 for the density parameter today , with the subscript @xmath14 to denote its baryon portion and @xmath45 its neutrino content .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath46 ( as distinct from @xmath42 ) to denote the planck constant in a few places where it arises . the term multiple - streaming",
    "is reserved for the situation where a single observed redshift corresponds to more than one position in real space .",
    "we distinguish it from the term orbit - crossing , which is commonly used interchangeably with multiple - streaming in other contexts .",
    "orbit - crossing refers to the case where a single position has more than one velocity .",
    "a photon emitted with energy higher than @xmath47 ( wavelength of @xmath48 ) by a distant quasar is continuously redshifted as it travels through the intergalactic medium until it reaches the observer . at some intermediate point , the photon is redshifted to around @xmath48 in the rest frame of the intervening medium , which may contain neutral hydrogen .",
    "it can then excite the ly@xmath0 transition and be absorbed .",
    "let us consider a particular line of sight from the observer to the quasar .",
    "the optical depth @xmath49 ( the probability of transmission is given by @xmath50 ) of a photon at a given observed frequency @xmath51 is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath38 is the comoving radial coordinate of some intermediate point along the line of sight , @xmath40 is the redshift and @xmath53 is the proper number density of neutral hydrogen at that point .",
    "the limits of integration , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are the comoving positions of the observer and the quasar .",
    "the ly@xmath0 absorption cross - section is denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "it is a function of the frequency of the photon with respect to the rest frame of the intervening hydrogen at position @xmath38 .",
    "let us call this frequency @xmath45 .",
    "the cross - section is peaked when @xmath45 is equal to the ly@xmath0 frequency , @xmath57 .",
    "the frequency @xmath45 is related to the observed frequency @xmath51 by : @xmath58 where @xmath37 is the peculiar velocity along the line of sight at position @xmath38 and @xmath59 is the redshift factor _ due to the uniform hubble expansion alone _ at the same position . the peculiar velocity of the observer , which merely displaces the whole spectrum by a constant amount ( independent of @xmath38 ) , is ignored . the quantity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the speed of light , is much smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "it proves convenient for later discussion to expand @xmath40 around some mean redshift of interest @xmath63 , which could be the redshift of a simulation output or the average redshift of an observed spectrum with limited redshift range . using @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the hubble scale factor and @xmath66 is the proper time",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the position at which the redshift due to hubble expansion coincides exactly with @xmath63 .",
    "the hubble constant at the same redshift is denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "we assume the range of @xmath38 is small enough so that @xmath70 .",
    "the convention @xmath71 today is adopted .",
    "the velocity coordinate @xmath72 defined above contains contributions from both the hubble expansion and the peculiar motion .",
    "without peculiar motion , @xmath72 increases monotonically with @xmath38 and is in fact linear in @xmath38 .",
    "peculiar velocities destroy the linear relation and could give rise to situations where a given @xmath72 corresponds to more than one position @xmath38 .",
    "it implies that a photon of a given observed frequency @xmath51 can have the same rest - frame frequency @xmath45 at more than one place in its trajectory from the quasar to the observer .",
    "we reserve the term multiple - streaming to this situation and distinguish it from orbit - crossing where a given @xmath38 carries more than one @xmath37 or @xmath72 .",
    "we will return to the subject of multiple - streaming in sec .",
    "[ v ] and that of orbit - crossing in sec .",
    "[ zasection ] .",
    "we define one more velocity coordinate @xmath73 , which is related to the observed frequency @xmath51 by : @xmath74 where @xmath57 is the ly@xmath0 frequency .",
    "the velocity coordinate @xmath73 is simply equal to @xmath72 when @xmath45 coincides exactly with @xmath57 ( this can be seen by comparing eq . [ [ ux ] ] and [ [ uuo2 ] ] , bearing in mind that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are both assumed to be much less than @xmath62 ) .    with the definitions in place ,",
    "we change the variable from @xmath38 to @xmath72 in equation ( [ taux ] ) , which results in the following expression for @xmath49 , now a function of @xmath73 : @xmath77 the summation refers to a sum over multiple - streams ( all the @xmath38 s within the range @xmath78 that corresponds to a given @xmath72 ) , and @xmath53 , @xmath40 and @xmath79 are now functions of @xmath72 .",
    "the limits of integration @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the velocity coordinates corresponding to the positions @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( assuming no orbit - crossing so that each @xmath38 carries one @xmath72 ) .",
    "note that in practice , only a limited range of @xmath72 contributes to @xmath49 for a limited range of @xmath73 so that one can replace the redshift @xmath40 with @xmath63 .",
    "the same is also true for equation ( [ taux ] ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 cross - section is expressed as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "the constant @xmath83 is equal to the combination of fundamental physical constants @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the charge of an electron and @xmath86 is its mass .",
    "it is about @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is equal to @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath90 is the mass of a proton and @xmath91 is the temperature of the gas at the velocity coordinate @xmath72 .",
    "the form of the line profile function above takes into account thermal broadening but ignores the natural line width .",
    "a more general profile function involves a convolution of the two , resulting in the voigt profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the voigt profiles are accurately thermal profiles for column density less than about @xmath19 .",
    "the reader is referred to spitzer ( 1978 ) and press and rybicki ( 1993 ) for discussions of curve of growth analysis .",
    "note also that it is sometimes assumed @xmath14 contains a component due to turbulent motion .",
    "we do not include it explicitly in our formalism .",
    "bulk motion , on the other hand , is accounted for by @xmath92 or @xmath72 .",
    "let us consider two different limits of equation ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "suppose there is a high local maximum in @xmath93 at some @xmath94 with width in velocity space much smaller than the thermal width @xmath14 .",
    "then one can take the line profile function associated with @xmath56 out of the integral in equation ( [ tau ] ) because @xmath93 varies much more rapidly than the thermal profile : @xmath95 where the variable of integration has been changed back from @xmath72 to @xmath38 .",
    "the equation holds when @xmath73 is close enough to @xmath96 .",
    "the integral is over the local maximum , assuming that the amount of neutral hydrogen away from the maximum does not cause significant absorption ( until another maximum is encountered ) .",
    "one then sees an absorption line with a gaussian profile in optical depth .",
    "while the width of the line tells us about @xmath14 , which is proportional to the square root of the temperature , the depth of the line provides information about both @xmath14 and the column density , which is the integral inside the first pair of brackets on the right hand side .",
    "let us call this the narrow - maximum - limit .",
    "consider another limit of the integral ( eq . [ [ tau ] ] ) in which @xmath93 varies slowly with @xmath72 .",
    "suppose the scale of variation is much larger than the thermal width . in this case , one can leave the line profile function inside the integral but take the rest outside : vanishes .",
    "further discussion on velocity caustics can be found in sec .",
    "[ v ] . ] @xmath97 the velocity dependent terms on the right hand side are evaluated at @xmath73 .",
    "the profile function has been integrated out .    in the above limit , @xmath49 does not necessarily have the thermal profile around its maxima .",
    "we will call this the broad - maximum - limit .",
    "an extreme example is that of a homogeneous medium , which gives rise to featureless and uniform absorption ( @xcite )",
    ".    conventional analysis of quasar spectra involves identifying those parts of the spectra that are due to the ly@xmath0 absorption and fitting them with superpositions of the voigt profiles ( of which the thermal profiles are a subset ) until the residual signal is consistent with noise .",
    "this technique was motivated by the picture of the intergalactic medium as consisting of a smooth component which causes relatively little absorption and a set of clouds that satisfy the narrow - maximum - limit . for each cloud",
    ", the best - fit voigt profile then yields its temperature and column density according to equation ( [ cloud ] ) .    however , it is clear that for a general fluctuating medium , not all maxima in @xmath49 necessarily satisfy the conditions leading to equation ( [ cloud ] ) .",
    "in fact , according to most structure formation theories , there invariably exist fluctuations in the intergalactic medium on scales larger than the thermal width . in the broad - maximum - limit",
    ", the shape of a local maximum in optical depth is determined by the distributions of @xmath53 and @xmath98 around it .",
    "each maximum in @xmath49 can still be identified as an absorption line and one can even apply standard techniques and try to fit its shape with superposition of the voigt profiles . given the best - fit voigt profiles , one can assign a @xmath14-value ( width of the profile ) and a column density to each profile but it is no longer true , for instance , that the @xmath14-value thus obtained is equal to @xmath99 ( eq . [ [ tau ] ] ) . a reasonable question to ask is whether there are other practical methods of identifying absorption lines and assigning column densities without assuming every absorption line consists of a superposition of the voigt profiles .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ licdd ] .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that all existing observational data on the column density distribution are obtained using the voigt - profile - fitting - technique , so for the purpose of comparing theory with these observations , it is important the line - identification algorithm one uses gives results consistent with the profile - fitting - technique .    in general , there are regions of high density and limited extent , galaxies for instance , which give rise to absorption profiles well approximated by the narrow - maximum - limit , but there are also regions in the intergalactic medium with gentle fluctuations where the broad - maximum - limit holds .",
    "then there are those places where neither limit applies , in which cases , a full integration of equation ( [ tau ] ) has to be carried out to compute the optical depth .",
    "to do so , one needs to know how the neutral hydrogen density , peculiar velocity and temperature vary with spatial position .",
    "this is the subject of the next section . in any case , the above discussion should make it clear that the quasar absorption spectrum contains a wealth of information on the intergalactic medium .",
    "there are four quantities that go into the computation of the optical depth : temperature , peculiar velocity , overdensity and neutral fraction",
    ". that the temperature and peculiar velocity are important should be obvious from the expression for the absorption cross - section in equation ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "the temperature determines the extent of thermal broadening ( @xmath14 ) and the peculiar velocity changes the frequency of the photon in the fluid rest - frame ( eq . [ [ ux ] ] ) .",
    "let us define carefully what we mean by the other two quantities , the overdensity and the neutral fraction .",
    "suppose @xmath100 is the total proper number density of all hydrogen species at position @xmath36 and @xmath101 is its spatial average .",
    "the overdensity @xmath102 , which describes the variation in space of @xmath100 , satisfies : @xmath103 \\ , \\ , , \\ , \\ , \\rho_b ( { \\bf x } ) = \\bar \\rho_b \\left[1+\\delta_{\\rm b}({\\bf x})\\right ] \\ , . \\label{deltadef}\\ ] ] in the first expression , @xmath102 is defined as the number overdensity of hydrogen . in the second expression , we equate @xmath102 with the mass overdensity of baryons ( @xmath104 is the proper mass density of baryons and @xmath105 is its mean ) , which is an excellent approximation for our application because there is no significant conversion of hydrogen into other elements , nor is there any interaction that could cause the spatial distribution of hydrogen to deviate significantly from that of other types of baryons .    what the ly@xmath0 absorption directly probes is not the total hydrogen density but its neutral component . the neutral fraction @xmath106 is defined by the following relation : @xmath107 where @xmath53 is the proper number density of neutral hydrogen as a function of space .",
    "the neutral fraction is determined by the balance between recombination and ionization , the rates of which are dictated by the temperature and radiation intensity respectively .",
    "in general , all four quantities , overdensity @xmath102 , peculiar velocity @xmath37 , temperature @xmath91 and neutral fraction @xmath108 , are functions of position . in the next two sub - sections ,",
    "we discuss first how to determine the spatial distributions of @xmath102 and @xmath37 , and second how @xmath91 and @xmath106 vary with position through their dependence on @xmath102 .",
    "all quantities are evaluated at @xmath109 .",
    "although most of the material in this section is standard textbook fare , it consists of a somewhat unusual combination of methods , so it is worth going through the basic equations and stating our assumptions carefully",
    ".      in cosmological models where dark matter ( a term we use interchangeably with non - interacting matter ) dominates the mass density of the universe , @xmath102 as defined in equation ( [ deltadef ] ) coincides with the dark matter overdensity @xmath110 on large scales .",
    "we define @xmath110 in an analogous manner as before ( eq . [ [ deltadef ] ] ) : @xmath111 \\ , , \\label{deltadm}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the mass density of dark matter at position @xmath113 and @xmath114 is its mean .",
    "the equality @xmath115 is equivalent to the statement that the hydrogen density ( which we assume is simply proportional to the baryon density ) varies with position in the same manner as the dark matter density does .",
    "this is true on large scales where gas pressure is insignificant compared to the gravitational attraction of the dark matter , provided the baryons and dark matter start out having the same spatial distribution , which is approximately true for most popular cosmological models .",
    "moreover , with no significant interaction that distinguishes between the two on large scales , the baryons and dark matter share the same peculiar velocity field . on small scales , however , gas pressure can cause the spatial distributions of baryons and dark matter and their velocities to differ .",
    "we will return to this point below .",
    "hence , on sufficiently large scales ( how large is large , an obviously important question , will be addressed later ) , it is adequate to know the overdensity and peculiar velocity of the dark matter .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ) is a well - tested approximation to compute the density and velocity distributions of dark matter in the mildly nonlinear regime ( @xmath116 ) before orbit - crossing .",
    "the reader is referred to the article by shandarin and zeldovich ( 1989 ) for a comprehensive review ( see also hui and bertschinger 1996 for an alternative formulation of the approximation ) .",
    "the starting point of the zeldovich approximation is the following equation for the displacement of a given mass element or particle : @xmath117 the coordinate @xmath118 is the initial position of the mass element and @xmath36 is its comoving position as a function of time .",
    "the displacement is then @xmath119 .",
    "its time dependent part @xmath120 is the linear growth factor ( peebles 1980 ) , which , for a universe with critical matter density , can be equated with @xmath65 , the hubble scale factor . the time independent function @xmath121 is determined by initial conditions .",
    "growing mode initial conditions dictate that it is curl - free , hence its form as the gradient of the potential @xmath122 ( @xmath123 is the spatial gradient in @xmath85 space ) .",
    "expressions for the peculiar velocity and overdensity follow immediately from equation ( [ zad ] ) : @xmath124 \\ , .",
    "\\label{zav}\\ ] ] the dot in the first expression denotes differentiation with respect to proper time @xmath66 .",
    "the peculiar velocity is defined by @xmath125 .",
    "the second expression follows from mass conservation i.e. @xmath126 .",
    "the right hand side of the second expression is simply the jacobian of the @xmath85-@xmath38 transformation matrix .",
    "the function @xmath127 contains all the information on the specific cosmological model one chooses to study . for the cosmological models we study in this paper ,",
    "it is a gaussian random field in @xmath118 space .",
    "suppose @xmath128 is its fourier counterpart defined by @xmath129 .",
    "the two - point correlation of @xmath130 is related to the commonly used power spectrum @xmath131 by @xmath132 where @xmath131 is related to the root - mean - squared ( rms ) linear overdensity fluctuation by @xmath133 note that @xmath134 for a universe with critical matter density , choosing @xmath135 today .    to produce a realization of the density and velocity fields for a given cosmological model ,",
    "we employ the following procedure : first , we use the corresponding power spectrum to generate the gaussian random field @xmath136 on a grid ; second , we displace particles from their initial grid positions ( @xmath118 ) according to equation ( [ zad ] ) for @xmath120 corresponding to @xmath137 ; third , a peculiar velocity is assigned to each particle according to the first expression in equation ( [ zav ] ) ; finally , we use the tsc ( triangular - shaped density cloud ) scheme ( @xcite ) to interpolate the particle positions and velocities to become momentum and mass densities on the grid and divide one by the other to obtain the velocity itself . the interpolation to obtain mass density is our way of enforcing mass conservation , as is expressed in the second expression of equation ( [ zav ] ) . in the last procedure ,",
    "we smooth the momentum and mass density fields over a small number of grid cells ( in fact , we use one and have checked that the precise number is not important as long as it is small ) before performing the division to obtain the velocity field so that we have well - defined velocities even in places with zero density after the tsc interpolation ( @xcite ) .",
    "any line of sight can then be chosen through the simulation box and the above set of steps gives the overdensity and peculiar velocity ( in fact only the component parallel to the line of sight is needed ) at each grid point on it .",
    "the procedure just outlined is very efficient because there is no need to integrate any equation of motion .",
    "one simply multiplies the displacement of each particle by an appropriate factor of @xmath120 .",
    "however , the first step of the procedure has to be slightly modified to address two problems .",
    "the first one is orbit - crossing .",
    "the zeldovich approximation is known to predict too rapid growth of the thickness of the post - collapse pancake ( shandarin and zeldovich 1989 ) .",

    "[ zhang ] , an initial smoothing scale ( @xmath266 ) larger than the jeans length ( @xmath267 ) was chosen to deal with the problem of orbit - crossing .",

    "the low column density systems mostly consist of relatively broad density peaks .",
    "some explanation is also in order regarding the spectral analysis method used by zhang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in obtaining the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] .",
    "it consists of identifying absorption features above a specified opacity and deblending them into individual lines centered at local maxima in optical depth and fitting each with a suitable voigt profile .",
    "this procedure is designed to be similar to most observers analysis techniques but is not exactly the same . in particular most observers method",
    "consists of seeking a `` minimal '' set of voigt profiles , the superposition of which reproduces the input absorption spectrum to within some specified error consistent with noise .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the definition of `` minimal '' tends to vary from one observer to another .",
    "the superposition of voigt profiles identified using the method of zhang et al . seems to reproduce the input spectrum quite well ( see fig . 2 of zhang et al .",

    "[ zhang ] two sets of curves based on the lognormal approximation but using the same density - peak - anstz ( see gnedin and hui 1996 ) . one of them has the same amount of initial smoothing as that of the truncated zeldovich approximation and the other has less smoothing so as to match the final ( not linear ) rms density fluctuation of the zeldovich computation . in both cases , the lognormal approximation tends to predict too much flattening of the column density distribution at low column densities . in general",
    "the lognormal approximation tends to give column density distributions that deviate quite significantly from power - law unless a very small smoothing length @xmath166 is chosen .",
    "( from the figure , it might appear that the lognormal approximation gives more lines than the zeldovich approximation at the very low column densities but it is really a resolution effect : see the next sub - section . )",
    "the reader might have noticed that we have included in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] a wider range of column densities than is warranted by the nature of our approximations .",
    "for instance , objects with column densities higher than @xmath269 are almost certainly highly nonlinear and we do not expect the truncated zeldovich approximation to work well in this regime .",
    "for the low column densities , the finite resolution should cause us to underestimate the number of absorption lines . in the next sub - section ,",
    "we give quantitative estimates of the range of column densities within which the density - peak - anstz , used in conjunction with the truncated zeldovich approximation , can be counted upon to give reliable column density distributions .",
    "we will also discuss two different ways of defining a density peak in the next sub - section : local maxima over three cells or local maxima over five cells with the slope on either side of the maxima not changing signs .",
    "the three - cell criterion is used in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] .",
    "one expects however that some of the three - cell peaks are not real but merely artifacts of numerical noise , especially those with low column densities .",
    "the five - cell criterion , on the other hand , probably fails to include some narrow peaks which are real .",
    "we will see that the two different criteria give almost identical results above a certain column density .",
    "one aspect of the density - peak - anstz we have glossed over is that two density peaks that are separated by a distance in velocity space much less than the thermal width should be counted as contributing to not two but one absorption line .",
    "a more sophisticated approach would be to group together such density peaks and use the sum of their column densities as the column density of one single absorption line .",
    "we find that for the the range of validity discussed in the following sub - section , it makes little difference .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that this effect can not be ignored for simulations with higher resolution than we have , or at higher redshifts , where line blending is more important .      for the computation presented in fig .",

    "[ zhang ] , comparing with the hydrodynamic simulation data , the density - peak - anstz coupled with the truncated zeldovich approximation , seems to give a reliable number density of absorption lines even for column densities higher than @xmath273 .",
    "the level of agreement at such high column densities ( and by extension , such high @xmath102 ) is surprising .",
    "we will adopt the conservative upper limit of @xmath272 .    to determine the column density below which finite resolution results in an underestimate of the number of absorption lines , we perform a simulation using the truncated zeldovich approximation with the same parameters as the open squares in fig .",

    "a summary of parameters of all models can be found in tables  [ cdmmodels ] and  [ mdmmodels ] .",
    "let us first consider the case in which the equation of state is fixed at @xmath283 . as is shown in equation ( [ npk3 ] )",
    ", the column density of a density peak with a given @xmath102 ( overdensity ) is proportional to the following combination of parameters : @xmath284 hence , by equation ( [ goodie ] ) , if @xmath285 is rescaled by a certain factor ( by changing @xmath193 , @xmath286 or @xmath172 or their combinations ) , the number of absorption lines is also changed by the same factor at an appropriately rescaled column density .",

    "the analysis of rugers and hogan ( 1996 ) , on the other hand , favors the value @xmath301 , which means @xmath302 for the same values of @xmath91 and @xmath172 .",

    "we note in passing that strictly speaking , altering @xmath286 , in addition to rescaling the number of absorption lines as discussed above , also changes the transfer function in a non - trivial way .",

    "a larger index ( smaller @xmath5 ) means for a density peak with a given @xmath155 ( and its second derivative ) , the column density is larger or smaller depending on whether @xmath155 is bigger or smaller than one .",

    "hence as a crude approximation , we conclude that the mean temperature , radiation intensity and baryon density mainly determine the overall normalization of the column density distribution .",
    "the equation of state , on the other hand , mostly affects the slope of the column density distribution , but its effect is small for a reasonable range of @xmath5 .",
    "it has been shown that the normalization of the column density distribution is influenced by the thermal and ionization states of the intergalactic medium , which are not well - constrained observationally .",
    "the slope of the distribution , on the other hand , is only weakly affected by the equation of state or temperature - density relation .",
    "the slope of the column density distribution is therefore relatively free of uncertainties due to our ignorance of the thermal and ionization properties of the intergalactic medium .",

    "furthermore it should be kept in mind that equation ( [ slope ] ) holds only for @xmath363 and @xmath364 . as the constants @xmath367 , @xmath368 and @xmath369 are only meant to be coefficients of a taylor series expansion .",
    "finally , one obvious problem of using equation ( [ slope ] ) to make prediction for a given cosmological model is that both @xmath11 and @xmath12 varies with the smoothing scale .",
    "an example of how the choice of smoothing scale can affect the column density distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ smooth ] . the comparison between results of a hydrodynamic simulation and our zeldovich computation in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] seems to support the choice of smoothing in equation ( [ ks ] ) .",
    "however , one could reasonably argue that the jeans scale ( eq . [ [ jk ] ] ) is a more physically motivated smoothing scale while the choice in equation ( [ ks ] ) was made only as a device to counter the effect of orbit - crossing and hence one can not be sure that one is not thereby erasing real structures on scales smaller than the orbit - crossing scale but larger than the jeans length , which can contribute significantly to the low column density lyman - alpha forest . one way to settle this question",
    "is to make more detailed comparisons with more hydrodynamic simulations , which is outside the scope of the present work and we will leave for a future paper .",
    "it suffices to say that , for models with sufficiently little small scale power such as the chdm models considered in sec .",
    "[ mdm ] , which have orbit - crossing scales close to or smaller than the jeans length , it is probably safe to smooth according to the prescription laid down in sec .",
    "[ zasection ] and that the precise smoothing scale might not matter very much ( see fig .  [ smoothmdmnu02 ] ) . for more nonlinear models",
    ", we can only offer the comparison in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] as one piece of evidence that smoothing on the orbit - crossing scale works reasonably well .",
    "however , for whatever smoothing scale one decides upon , we expect equation ( [ slope ] ) to hold approximately , provided that @xmath363 and @xmath364 .    with these being",
    "said , let us try to understand qualitatively the parameter dependence of @xmath25 as expressed in equation ( [ slope ] ) .",
    "first , the dependence on @xmath5 . recall that @xmath372 ( taking into account the correlation between @xmath155 and its second derivative ) .",
    "this means that higher density peaks translate into higher @xmath215 and vice versa . lowering @xmath5 increases the effect of this translation i.e. a given density peak with @xmath373",
    "is associated with a higher column density if @xmath5 is reduced ( the opposite is true for @xmath374 ) .",
    "the net effect is to stretch a power - law - like column density distribution and make it flatter .",
    "the effect is small for a reasonable range of @xmath5 .",
    "it should be between @xmath375 and @xmath376 at @xmath377 if the universe reionizes before @xmath378 ( see hui and gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "a somewhat larger range is shown in fig .",
    "[ eqs ] .",
    "second , the dependence on @xmath11 : a cosmological model with lower @xmath11 is in a more `` linear '' state of evolution compared to higher @xmath11 models . in other words , a lower @xmath11 model has proportionally more intermediate density peaks compared to high density ones , hence the steeper column density distribution ( associating once again high density peaks with high column densities using the @xmath379 scaling ) . for sufficiently low column densities , however ,",
    "the absorption lines arise from very underdense regions which should be more common in higher @xmath11 models .",
    "hence at very low column densities , the high @xmath11 model should win : it has more very low density peaks . where this might occur",
    "we can not tell from our simulations because of the limited resolution . for the range of column densities we can measure reliably",
    ", the slope of the column density distribution simply steepens as @xmath11 is lowered .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath12 is more subtle .",
    "to understand it , we resort to a press - schechter - type argument ( press & schechter 1974 ) . according to the press - schechter theory ,",
    "the low mass slope of @xmath380 ( the number density of clumps of mass @xmath381 per unit range @xmath382 ) is @xmath383 which means that smaller @xmath384 ( @xmath385)implies a steeper slope of the clump number density distribution , exhibiting the same trend as in the case of equation ( [ slope ] ) .",
    "the @xmath384 dependence arises from the fact that @xmath386 ( @xmath11 with smoothing scale @xmath387 ) and assuming @xmath388 , together with @xmath389 ( for high @xmath387 ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath390 appears because @xmath380 is a number density .",
    "the dependence of @xmath380 on @xmath391 follows from a simple conjecture : the probability that a given point belongs to a clump of mass @xmath381 or higher is equal to @xmath392 where @xmath393 is a fixed threshold and @xmath394 is the gaussian probability distribution for overdensity @xmath395 with dispersion @xmath396 .",
    "one can carry the above reasoning over to absoprtion lines , keeping in mind something like the threshold algorithm for identifying lines as the analogue of the threshold - criterion of the press - schechter theory for a collapsed clump .",
    "assume @xmath397 ( because in the linear regime , it is the peak width , not the peak height that provides the lowest order contribution to column density ) , it `` follows '' that @xmath398 , again in the high @xmath387 limit .",
    "the factor of @xmath387 is to account for the quantity of interest being a one - dimensional number density .",
    "it is easy to see this implies @xmath399 i.e. smaller @xmath12 ( larger @xmath400 ) implies steeper column density distribution .",
    "this admittedly crude argument actually gives a value for @xmath25 that agrees surprisingly well with what we have found using the zeldovich approximation and density - peak - anstz .",
    "for example , for the cdm model in fig .",
    "[ zhang ] , @xmath401 ( see table  [ cdmmodels ] ) , @xmath402 according to the adapted - press - schechter argument .",
    "this of course brings up the question why there does not seem to be any @xmath11 dependence of @xmath25 in the above argument .",
    "it is in fact possible to develop this line of reasoning further to include the @xmath11 dependence , but we will leave this to a later paper .    finally , it is interesting to point out that because most realistic cosmological models have similar power on large scales ( cobe or cluster scale ) , small @xmath11 on small scales almost necessarily means a steeper fall - off of the power spectrum , namely smaller @xmath12 .",
    "so , in practice , both the amplitude @xmath11 and the slope @xmath12 of the power spectrum work in the same direction in decreasing / increasing the slope of the column density distribution . hence , as a rule of thumb , less small scale power implies a steeper column density distribution , for the column densities of interest in this paper .",
    "in this section , we turn our attention to chdm models , which have relatively little small scale power and for which the method of truncated zeldovich approximation is ideally suited .",
    "the orbit - crossing scales for them are either smaller than or only slightly larger than the jeans length and so one has reasons to believe any structure erased by our smoothing procedure does not contribute significantly to the number of absorption lines in the range of column densities we are interested in .",
    "predictions for the chdm models are also of current interest because no hydrodynamic simulations of the lyman - alpha forest have been performed for these models .",
    "we list in table [ mdmmodels ] the chdm models considered in this section .",
    "they are all @xmath403 models with @xmath404 . both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 versions are considered .",
    "they have been shown to give good agreement with the observational data on large scales ( @xmath387 around @xmath405 ) ( see fig . 6 and 7 of ma 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath406 models seem to conflict with the observed abundance of damped ly@xmath0 systems , which correspond to roughly @xmath387 around @xmath407 comoving in the linear power spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we include one @xmath406 chdm model in table [ mdmmodels ] for the sake of comparison .",
    "as is shown convincingly by ma ( 1996 ) , all models need some amount of tilt to match observations .",
    "we compute as before the column density distribution for each model using the density - peak - anstz and the zeldovich approximation with appropriate smoothing . the ( density weighted )",
    "power spectrum for each chdm model is taken from ma ( 1996 ) .    as we have discussed in the last section ,",
    "a plot of rms smoothed linear density fluctuation @xmath11 versus smoothing scale @xmath142 ( eq . [ [ sigma0 ] ] ) is a very good indicator of what column density distribution to expect .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ psmmdm ] for the chdm models tabulated in table [ mdmmodels ] .",
    "the no - tilt @xmath207 cdm model is also plotted for comparison .",
    "because of neutrino free streaming , all chdm models have less power ( smaller @xmath11 ) and steeper spectral slope ( smaller @xmath12 ) than the cdm model on small scales . those with more neutrino content ( @xmath32 ) have even less power than the others .",
    "in fact , the @xmath32 models have @xmath408 on all scales larger than the jeans scale ( @xmath409 ) .",
    "one expects the zeldovich approximation to work particularly well for these models because the amount of orbit - crossing will not be significant , even without initial truncation .",
    "this is borne out by the next test : we compute the column density distribution for one chdm model b2 and examine the effect of choosing different smoothing scales .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ smoothmdmnu02 ] .",
    "the column density distribution in the range plotted does not change much at all for the three different smoothing scales plotted .",
    "contrast this with the case of @xmath207 cdm ( fig .",
    "[ smooth ] ) where the column density distribution is more sensitive to changes in the smoothing scale .",
    "that s why the truncation scale has to be chosen with some care for the cdm model : not too small ( @xmath142 too big ) so that too much orbit crossing has occurred and not too large so that too much small scale structure is erased .",
    "the standard prescription ( sec .",
    "[ zasection ] ) seems to work well according to fig .",
    "[ zhang ] .    for the chdm model considered ( in fact , it holds true for all other @xmath32 models here ) ,",
    "the amount of small scale power is so insignificant that excluding them by smoothing does not affect the overall column density distribution at all ( except possibly that one loses the small scale fluctuations that can give rise to very low column density absorption i.e. lower than our resolution limit ) .",
    "we have also done similar tests for the @xmath33 models , their response to changes in the truncation scale is somewhere between the @xmath410 cdm model and the @xmath32 chdm models , as can be expected based on their difference in fig .",

    "we adopt the following truncation scales for the chdm models . for the @xmath33 models , the standard prescription described in sec .",

    "[ zasection ] , @xmath413 is adopted .",
    "again , we emphasize that for this class of models that have relatively little power on small scales , the precise truncation scale is not important .",

    "one should bear in mind uncertainties due to the choice of smoothing scale , as we have presented in the last section .",

    "[ smoothmdmnu02 ] ) .",

    "[ zhang ] ; the results of which compare favorably with a hydrodynamic simulation ) should be robust .    in sec .",
    "[ cdm ] , we have discussed how the equation of state or temperature - density relation can also change the slope of the column density distribution , although the effect is small for a reasonable range of @xmath5 .",

    "it should be kept in mind that we can always shift the column density distribution up and down by rescaling @xmath285 ( sec .",

    "the same conclusion holds for the other low hubble constant @xmath32 model ( @xmath430 ) .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that a more detailed comparison between the predictions of the models and observations , taking into account noise and biases of the line identification techniques , is necessary before any model can be considered ruled out .",
    "the high hubble constant ( @xmath421 ) @xmath32 models @xmath422 and @xmath420 , on the other hand , have intrinsically flatter distributions and a reasonable match between theory and observations can be made by choosing @xmath5 in the range @xmath431 .",
    "we have systematically developed a set of tools to compute in an efficient manner the column density distribution given a cosmological model .",
    "one fundamental assumption of the approximations involved is that most of the ly@xmath0 forest with column densities in the range @xmath432 originates from regions of low overdensities or even underdensities which have not undergone orbit - crossing .",
    "the result of a comparison with a hydrodynamic simulation lends support to it .",
    "one major conclusion we reach , in the process of developing the tools , is that the peculiar velocities play a minor role in determining the column density distribution at our column densities of interest , even though they are very important in determining the shapes of individual absorption line profiles .",
    "we take advantage of this fact and develop a method we call the density - peak - anstz in which each density peak is identified as an absorption line and assigned a column density based on its local properties .",
    "the column density distribution then becomes a statistic of density peaks .    in sec .",
    "[ cdm ] and [ slopecd ] , we investigate the factors controlling the column density distribution , which can be divided into two categories .",
    "one mostly affects the normalization , while the other mostly influences the slope .",
    "those that fall into the former category include the ionizing radiation intensity , the mean temperature of the intergalactic medium and the mean baryon density . uncertainties in their values are such that almost any viable cosmological model which has the correct slope of the column density distribution can be made to match observations by a judicious choice of parameters .    the factors that mostly affect the slope of the distribution include the equation of state and more strongly so , the amplitude and slope of the ( linear ) power spectrum on scales @xmath433 .",
    "models that have less power on these scales tend to have comparatively more intermediate density peaks than high density ones and hence have relatively steeper column density distributions .",
    "models with a steeper power spectrum on these scales have @xmath434 that falls off more quickly with increasing @xmath435 ( @xmath436 ) and therefore a steeper column density distribution , assuming high column density corresponds to high @xmath435 ( press - schechter argument ; see sec .",
    "[ slopecd ] ) .",
    "equations of state which are closer to isothermal ( smaller @xmath5 where @xmath5 satisfies @xmath437 ) tend to produce flatter column density distributions . however , within the reasonable range of @xmath5 ( see hui and gnedin 1996 ) , its precise value depending upon the reionization history , the effect of changing the equation of state is small .",
    "we put forward an approximate expression relating the slope of the column density distribution to @xmath5 and the amplitude ( @xmath11 ) and slope ( @xmath12 ) of the power spectrum on small scales ( eq . [ [ slope ] ] ) , which describes reasonably well all the models we study in this paper .",
    "hence , the slope of the column density distribution provides a measure of the amplitude and slope of the power spectrum on small scales for a given cosmological model and given temperature - density relation .",
    "we apply our techniques to study a class of chdm models which are known to have less power on small scales compared to other popular cdm models .",
    "we conclude that the chdm models indeed produce steeper column density distributions compared to the cdm models . in particular , the low hubble constant ( @xmath204 ) @xmath32 chdm models , which have the least amount of power on small scales among the models we study , have column density distributions which can be made consistent with observations only for @xmath5 less than the values we consider reasonable .",
    "we emphasize however that only after a more detailed comparison between theories and observations , including all the effects of noise and biases of the line - identification methods , can any model be considered ruled out by the observed column density distribution .",
    "we therefore conclude that a lot of work still needs to be done both on the observational and theoretical fronts .",
    "the biases of the line - identification techniques used for data reduction deserve close study so that the error bars in the observed column density distributions can be better understood and perhaps reduced .",
