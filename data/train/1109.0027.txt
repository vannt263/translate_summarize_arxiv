    "the evolution of baryons within their dark matter halos and the morphologies of the resulting systems depend on the merger and accretion history of the parent halos .",
    "major efforts of galaxy evolution studies today focus on how galaxies acquire the gas which fuels their star formation and what processes drive the distinctions between the red sequence and the blue cloud .",
    "still , our view of the extragalactic universe is only as complete as our methods for cataloging the galaxies that populate it .",
    "while the public wide area optical / ir and associated spectroscopic surveys are good at detecting luminous ellipticals , bright spirals and bursting or active galaxies , they are substantially less complete in tracing the low surface brightness , dwarf and gas - rich galaxy populations that actually dominate the local population .",
    "each catalog derived from an individual survey has its own built - in limitations and biases which affect our ability to construct a true census of the present day universe .",
    "because of its relatively simple physics , the hi line provides a useful tracer of the cool gas mass and of the star formation _",
    "potential _ in nearby galaxies and probes the very population of modest luminosity , gas rich objects which are often underrepresented in surveys selected by optical / ir properties . while it is clear that most stars form out of molecular rather than atomic hydrogen , the molecular clouds themselves develop through the collapse of overdensities in the more diffuse , neutral medium",
    "thus , while the connection of hi to star formation is on small scales indirect , the global hi content serves as a tracer of relative sf potential .",
    "however , at present , hi line measurements yield hi masses @xmath14 for far fewer galaxies than those for which stellar masses @xmath15 are available from optical / ir wide area surveys .",
    "in fact , only now are hi surveys adequate in terms of volume sensitivity to sample a cosmologically significant volume @xcite .",
    "after the pioneering results delivered by small - scale surveys such as the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the arecibo dual beam survey(adbs : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the advent of multi - feed array receivers on large single dish telescopes made possible wide - area 21  cm hi line surveys , such as the hi parkes all - sky survey , ( hipass : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the companion hi jodrell bank all - sky survey ( hijass : * ? ? ?",
    "while covering a large fraction of the sky , these surveys failed to sample a cosmologically fair volume because their mean depth was too shallow , typically @xmath16 mpc , and they were limited in both angular and spectral resolution and in sensitivity . as a result , hipass sampled only sparsely both the most hi - rich  but rare  objects and the lowest halo mass systems  detectable only if very nearby and with very narrow hi line widths and , because of the large parkes antenna beam ( 15.5 ) , suffered from confusion in the identification of optical counterparts ( ocs ) .",
    "the advent of a similar seven feed array at arecibo ( `` alfa '' , the arecibo l - band feed array ) has enabled a second - generation wide area extragalactic hi line survey , alfalfa , the * a*recibo * l*egacy * f*ast * alfa * survey @xcite .",
    "initiated in february 2005 , survey observations are now more than 90% complete . in this paper , we present the catalog of hi detections covering about 40% of the planned survey sky area , referred to hereafter as the @xmath2 catalog . both by design and because of improvements made possible by the accumulation and analysis of more survey data , the catalog presented here both extends and supercedes earlier ones presented by @xcite .",

    "a brief summary of the main points of this paper is given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the alfalfa observing strategy has been discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of particular note to this data release , observations during a given observing session use the alfa seven - beam receiver parked on the meridian with data acquired in `` almost fixed '' drift - scan mode ; minor motion of the telescope is permitted so that the position of the central beam tracks in constant j2000 declination . with the feed arm positioned along the meridian at azimuths near 180@xmath17 ( for declinations north of the arecibo zenith at dec .",
    "= 18@xmath1721 )  or 360@xmath17 ( for declinations south of zenith ) , the feed array is rotated by 19@xmath17 so that the seven beams sweep out tracks equally spaced in declination by about 2.1 . in nearly all circumstances ,",
    "a given observing run is dedicated to a single declination track .",
    "the 2-d ( time versus frequency ) drift scan datasets are converted from fits to idl format and run through an initial bandpass calibration and subtraction , normally within 24 hours of acquisition .",
    "in contrast to traditional total power , position switched pointed observations , a drift - scan survey ( of which alfalfa is certainly not the first example ) collects spectra continuously ( almost ) without moving the telescope . in the case of the alfalfa survey ,",
    "the sampling rate is 1 hz , i.e. a spectrum of 4096 spectral channels ( a `` record '' ) is recorded every second for each polarization of every beam of the feed array .",
    "the slowly - changing characteristics of the bandpass with time can thus be monitored effectively .",
    "the alfalfa pipeline does so by separately monitoring the behavior of each spectral channel across the time domain , through a robust , low - order polynomial fit ( which skips over sources ) , outside of the spectral region dominated by galactic emission .",
    "for each 600 record unit ( a 10 minute drift `` scan '' ) , we thus obtain a two - dimensional map of the bandpass which can be `` subtracted '' from each spectral record .",
    "such `` sky subtraction '' is thus conceptually similar to that of the traditional position - switching mode , although the duration of the `` off '' is much larger than that `` on '' source , gaining @xmath18 in sensitivity with respect to standard position - switching observations . during the same processing step ,",
    "continuum subtraction is also performed , and a separate continuum map is recorded .    for spectral channels affected by galactic hi emission , such `` sky subtraction '' is not an option , and the bandpass subtraction can not be applied in the same manner as for spectral channels away from the galactic signal . in this case , the spectral shape of the bandpass across the galactic emission region is adopted as a linear interpolation between the two galactic emission - free sides of the spectrum .",
    "thus , the flux calibration of galactic features processed by the standard alfalfa pipeline is not accurate .",
    "each 2-d bandpass - subtracted dataset for each beam and each polarization is examined interactively and flagged for radio frequency interference ( rfi ) ; regions characterized by lowered quality ( due to standing waves , gain instabilities etc ) are assigned a lower weight . while this step ( known as _ `` flagbb '' _ ) is laborious , the facts that the continuum information is retained and the rfi is not median filtered away enables the further use of the dataset to look for hi absorption , for the derivation of upper limits at arbitrary positions in 3-d , and for stacking analysis @xcite .",
    "the flattened and flagged 2-d line and continuum maps are archived as level i datasets .",
    "once the set of drift scans providing full coverage for a complete strip in declination is flagged in this manner , the set of evenly gridded data cubes is generated .",
    "details of the gridding process are given in @xcite and summarized here .",
    "the grids are square in the angular dimension , 2.4@xmath17 on a side , evenly sampled at 1   spacing .",
    "their center positions on the sky are spaced 8@xmath19 apart in r.a . and centered on odd integer declinations ; the spatial dimensions of a grid are 144 by 144 pixels . for convenient access using modest data processors , each spatial grid",
    "is split into four , partially overlapping subgrids , each covering 1024 frequency channels .",
    "the grid generation algorithm also converts the spectral intensities from units of antenna temperature to mjy / beam in flux density , correcting for zenith angle variations in the gain of the telescope .",
    "a first step in the examination of the grids performs an astrometric fit to the continuum sources within them ; this fit is then used to subtract off the residual telescope pointing errors @xcite .",
    "grids are then flatfielded and rebaselined in both the angular and spectral dimensions to improve their quality by accounting for variations in gain , calibration and other systematic blemishes .",
    "`` flatfielding '' here corresponds to the process by which pixel - to - pixel variations within each channel map , caused mainly by continuum fluctuations , are accounted for . for spectral channels away from galactic emission , extragalactic hi sources are typically small in comparison with the angular size of alfalfa data cubes ( `` grids '' of @xmath20 ) .",
    "scale variations in the continuum level which may not have been effectively removed by the bandpass subtraction procedure can be identified by robust - fitting a two - dimensional surface ( in the angular domain ) from the channel map . in the absence of very strong continuum sources ,",
    "this correction is generally small and it does not affect noise statistics in any significant way .",
    "after the angular flat fielding is performed , residual , localized spectral baseline features are also removed by subtracting low order polynomial fits to the signal free portions of the spectral domain around emission features .",
    "these arise , for example , from standing waves produced by multiple reflections of continuum source emission within the optical path .",
    "signal extraction is applied following @xcite , and once a catalog of candidate detections has been obtained , the grid is interactively examined , the global profiles are extracted , fluxes are measured , ocs are identified and remarks are recorded . it should be noted that this interactive process improves the definition of source parameters beyond the model fitting used by the automatic signal extractor ; this point , and the resultant reliability and completeness of the catalog , is discussed more fully in  [ sec : impact ] .",
    "the final catalog of sources is constructed following a process of culling poorer quality detections where a source is contained in adjacent overlapping grids and running a series of data quality checks .",
    "the catalog presented here supercedes previous alfalfa data releases for several reasons mainly having to do with ( 1 ) the increased size of the available dataset which yields better understanding of pointing errors , gain variations and other instrumental artifacts , ( 2 ) improved sdss coverage since the first catalogs were produced , ( 3 ) improvements in the algorithm used to make global profile measurements and ( 4 ) increased contiguous coverage .",
    "some earlier measurements tended to underestimate fluxes for the brightest and more extended sources , a systematic effect for which a correction is now applied ( see  [ sec : validate ] for the comparison of flux density measurements with published values ) . in most cases , changes to the flux density measurements included in earlier data releases",
    "are minor , but the current catalog is intended to replace the earlier ones entirely .",
    "it should be noted that further revisions of parameters for sources located near edges of the current grid coverage will come in the future in those cases when a newer grid in an adjacent strip better encompasses the source or contributes a higher quality dataset . by its nature as a cumulative drift scan survey , the harvest of alfalfa will both grow and improve over time .",
    "the full alfalfa survey is intended to cover 7000 deg@xmath1   of sky in two regions of high galactic latitude within @xmath21 of the arecibo zenith .",
    "all declinations will be covered @xmath22 dec . @xmath23 .",
    "since all observations are conducted during nighttime hours , the two regions are referred to as `` spring '' and ",
    "fall. the `` spring '' region extends from @xmath3 r.a .",
    "@xmath4 while the `` fall '' alfalfa region encompasses from @xmath9 r.a .",
    "some sources are found outside the stated r.a .",
    "boundaries where the actual drift scan observations extended beyond the nominal map area .",
    "some priority has been given to completing areas within the sdss spectroscopic survey footprint , and the pace of observing has been dictated by the availability of telescope time .",

    "it is important to note that the specific definitions of hi systemic velocity and the global profile velocity width are not uniformly adopted in the literature . for alfalfa",
    ", we adopt the same convention as that used by @xcite , that is , polynomials are fit to each side of the two - horned profile and then @xmath53 and @xmath29 are measured at the level of 50% of the peak intensity on either horn : @xmath53 is then the midpoint and @xmath29 the full width at that level . where appropriate ( face - on galaxies ; dwarf systems ) , a single gaussian provides the best fit and is similarly measured .",

    "the vertical axis shows the residual alfalfa - hi archive .",
    "the occurrence of outliers is expected because ( a ) alfalfa spectra correspond only to 40 sec per beam of integration time on source , whereas the targeted spectra are generally of much longer integration ; ( b ) targeted spectra are affected by pointing errors either in the coordinates used to position the telescope or intrinsic telescope pointing inaccuracy ; and ( c ) blends with close companions where the pointed spectra were taken with smaller single dish telescopes .",
    "a few cases of gross disagreement are explained by errors in the velocity scales of very old hi data which were acquired in the days before significant information was written into data headers , when the setup of the backend electronics and spectrometer required physical cabling and hand dial - setting at the start of each observing run and when records of frequency offsets for different quadrants of the spectrometer were kept only on hand - written index cards ; these cases are noted in the comments in table [ tab : comments ] .",
    "the appearance in the lower panel of some outliers at relatively low @xmath29 reminds us that at low s / n or in the presence of residual baseline structure , broad widths may be underestimated .",
    "the dependence of the sensitivity on line width is discussed in  [ sec : completeness ] . as evident in figure",

    "practical limitations and instrumental uncertainties restrict the accuracy with which hi line flux densities can be measured to not better than a few percent .",
    "despite regular calibration via the injection of a noise diode , drifts in the electronic gain , amplifier instabilities , sidelobe variations and standing waves ( caused by multiple reflections within the optical path of cosmic continuum sources or terrestrial rfi ) induce variations in the total power , while baseline irregularities and data loss due to rfi impact the measurement of flux density in noisy data .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , hi line flux densities derived from targeted ( pointed ) observations are typically accurate to not better than 15% ; older datasets taken when amplifiers were substantially less stable than today are probably accurate to not better than 25% .",
    "calibration of the alfalfa dataset is performed in two separate stages .",
    "first , during the course of an observing run , a noise diode , calibrated by the engineering staff in the lab , is fired once every 600 seconds .",
    "the data stream then includes a record with this additional power source ( the `` cal - on '' record ) .",
    "all observing runs contain at least 9 such calibrations ; longer ones may contain as many as 60 .",
    "a polynomial fit is performed to the ratio of the total power with the calibration diode on , versus when it is off , for the whole set for an observing block .",
    "this polynomial is then used to correct the individual records of the drift scan data .",
    "the second method of calibration is performed on the data after grid construction , making use of the radio continuum sources which they contain .",
    "a comparison is made of the flux densities of the source contained in the grids with published values in the nvss @xcite , and then an average correction factor is applied to tie the alfalfa flux scale to the nvss .",
    "further details on calibration of the alfalfa dataset are given in @xcite .",
    "even when gain corrections for frequency dependence and other effects are correctly calibrated out , hi line flux densities observed with single point observations must be corrected for beam dilution and , often , pointing errors .",
    "in addition to the inaccuracy of telescope pointing , particularly important in early arecibo observations , the input positions used to point the telescope were accurate only at the level of 0.51  level for some of the oldest observations used to acquire the archival data reanalyzed by @xcite ,    @xcite report both raw ( as observed ) and corrected values of the hi line flux density for galaxies observed via pointed observations of optically - selected targets .",
    "the true hi line flux density was derived by applying corrections for telescope pointing errors , errors in the positions used to point the telescope ( both of which apply more importantly to older datasets ) and for partial resolution by the telescope beam .",
    "the latter is derived by adopting a hybrid correction for source extent that is based on a modeled hi distribution scaled by the optical size and an average telescope beam power pattern . as a drift scan mapping survey , alfalfa flux densities are not subject to such corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : fluxes ] shows the comparison of the hi line flux densities measured by alfalfa with the values given in the @xcite hi archive .",
    "the latter are corrected for pointing and position errors and for source extent ( but not for internal hi absorption ) .",
    "the vertical axis shows the ratio of the hi line flux densities reported in the two catalogs .",
    "alfalfa detection code 1 objects are shown as blue open circles ; the lower s / n code 2 objects are shown in red filled circle . since the error in the hi line flux density for both surveys depends on the hi line flux density itself as well as the s / n of the spectrum and the magnitude of the corrections applied to the pointed data , the increasing scatter seen in the ratio at low hi line flux densities is as expected . when corrections for source extent are applied to the pointed data , the flux density scales are coincident within the errors .    among the sources with highest hi line flux density ,",
    "figure [ fig : fluxes ] suggests that the alfalfa flux algorithm may be missing some flux .",
    "the total flux should be recovered since alfalfa is a mapping survey but the hi line flux from very extended sources , especially those located towards the edges of the constructed grids could be lost due to the finite grid size and the bandpass subtraction and grid flattening schemes . for those ,",
    "alternative processing tools from the standard pipeline will be developed , after completion of the main survey .    in order to assess the contribution of very diffuse , extended hi in vicinity of nearby , isolated galaxies ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed a carefully- selected sample of @xmath0100 galaxies with both the former 42  m and the green bank telescopes .",
    "as they note , the uncertainty in the hi line flux density for their high signal - to - noise data is @xmath68 1% ; on the other hand , the uncertainties contributed by fitting the polynomial baseline and defining the boundaries of the emission profile are considerably larger . because an unblocked aperture should deliver reduced standing waves and minimal stray radiation , flux densities measured with the gbt should be more accurate than ones measured with a complex instrument like arecibo . at this point , there are only 12 galaxies in common with the sample observed very accurately with the former 42  m telescope by haynes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , not enough for conclusive results .",
    "these issues will be explored in a future work .",
    "although it might be expected to serve as the better dataset to use in examining systematic uncertainty and testing for missing flux from extended / bright sources , the northern hipass survey @xcite does not in practice provide an adequate comparison sample for several reasons . first , as mentioned above , flux calibration uncertainties do not dominate most hi flux density errors ; baseline uncertainties , noise and beam effects do .",
    "a drawback of the northern hipass catalog is that some of it suffers from residual baseline ripple , particularly when observations were made during the daytime @xcite .",
    "secondly , the sensitivity difference between arecibo and parkes means that the s / n of most alfalfa/@xcite detections is typically much higher than that of hipass .",
    "this fact alone , on top of the baseline issues , give the @xcite spectra a significant advantage over hipass in terms of parameter accuracy .",
    "thirdly , although there are 1000 galaxies in the northern hipass dataset @xcite at dec .",
    "@xmath69 , only  @xmath0350 lie in the overlap with the present @xmath2 catalog .",
    "lastly , there are no code 2 sources detected by hipass ( which is not surprising , given its much poorer sensitivity ) so we can not make the comparison between codes 1 and 2 . however , for the record , we include in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fluxes ] the similar comparison of flux densities from alfalfa and hipass ; clear cases of confusion within the parkes beam are not included in this analysis .",
    "curiously , alfalfa detects _ more _ flux density than hipass in some cases ; examination of those reveals that they are mainly alfalfa detections with broad @xmath29 for which hipass detects , at much lower s / n , a lower hi line flux density and a narrower @xmath29 , clearly missing some of the hi line emission detected by alfalfa .",
    "the practical exploitation of any survey requires an understanding of its source sensitivity , completeness and reliability . in comparison with previous blind hi surveys , alfalfa offers a much richer dataset which itself can be used to probe the robustness of its source catalog .",
    "source extraction and parameter measurement for alfalfa is performed in a two - step process , which includes automated as well as interactive procedures .",
    "initial source extraction is performed by a fully automatic matched - filtering method @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses templates which vary in shape as a function of profile width ( gaussian for narrow profiles , hermite functions for broad profiles ) , and outperforms algorithms based on smoothing followed by peakfinding ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the reliability ( i.e. the fraction of detections that correspond to real sources ) of this automated method is estimated to be @xmath70% for sources with @xmath71 , a value that was determined by performing source extraction on regions of the alfalfa datacubes expected to be devoid of cosmic signals ( corresponding to the velocity range @xmath72 km s@xmath27 , see  5.4 and figure 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "source candidates are then visually inspected and source parameters are interactively measured and catalogued . it should be noted that the parameters of the final catalogued sources ( e.g. @xmath31 , @xmath73 , @xmath29 , etc . ) do not generally coincide with the values determined by the automatic signal extractor , because the two procedures use different definitions and calculation methodologies for the parameters @xcite , and the human intervention is designed to optimize the measurement accuracy and further improve the reliability of the catalog by rejecting spurious detections that correspond to low - level rfi , poorly sampled data and residual baseline fluctuations .",
    "we therefore expect the final reliability of alfalfa code 1 detections to be very close to 100% .    however , as discussed by @xcite , the reliability of alfalfa sources extracted by the matched - filtering algorithm drops precipitously below a s / n of 6.5 .",
    "the code 2 sources included in table [ tab : catalog ] fall below this nominal alfalfa s / n detection threshold , but are included in the catalog because they coincide with an optical galaxy of known ( prior ) and coincident redshift .",
    "although these sources should not be included in statistical studies which require careful consideration of survey completeness and sensitivity limits , the vast majority are likely real hi line sources , and the gas in them will also contribute to the overall hi density in the local universe .",
    "hence , we include them in the following analysis of alfalfa completeness and their impact on measurements of cosmological parameters .",
    "the two step process used to identify , extract and measure the alfalfa detections presented in table [ tab : catalog ] results in a catalog of reliable detections that is dependent on _ both _ the integrated hi line flux density of a given source and its global hi line profile width , w@xmath74 .",
    "like all fixed integration - time spectroscopic surveys , alfalfa is more sensitive to narrow hi profiles than to broader ones of the same integrated line flux . based on the demonstrated performance during the single - pass precursor observations of the observing equipment and the signal extraction pipeline",
    ", @xcite predicted the specific relationship between the integrated flux density detection threshold ( s@xmath75 in jy km s@xmath27 ) and the profile width ( w@xmath74 , in km s@xmath27 ) of a source in terms of the s / n required for inclusion in the catalog :    @xmath76    note that the above expression differs from that given in equation 2 of @xcite ( numerical factor of 0.15 vs. 0.22 ) because that work adopts the rms appropriate to the single - drift maps used in the precursor observations .",
    "one of the principal conclusions of @xcite was that the two - pass strategy adopted for alfalfa would improve on that employed by the precursor program by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "`` sensitivity '' is a qualitative term that can be defined in terms of the survey `` completeness '' .",
    "we refer to the completeness of the alfalfa survey as that fraction of cosmic sources of a given integrated flux density and within the survey solid angle that are detected by alfalfa and included in the @xmath77.40 catalog .",
    "other blind hi surveys ( e.g. adbs , hipass ) have estimated the completeness of their catalogs as a function of profile width ( @xmath29 ) by examining their ability to recover synthetic sources of known characteristics ( peak flux , @xmath73 , @xmath29 , etc . )",
    "injected into the spectral cubes .",
    "one of the motivations for such an approach is to assess the reliability of sources in the presence of non - gaussian noise . as noted by @xcite ( see  5.4 and figure 8 of that paper ) , the impact of non - gaussian noise on the automatic signal extractor developed for alfalfa is generally minimal above s / n = 6.5 .",
    "its presence , principally in the form of the very broad spectral standing waves resulting from reflections in the telescope focal structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is responsible for the upturn at large @xmath29 in equation [ eq : eqnthresh ] . at the narrower widths",
    ", there is no evidence that a gaussian assumption is unfair .",
    "now that a significant alfalfa dataset exists , the data themselves can be used to derive the true sensitivity limits . the analysis of the real survey data is motivated both by a desire to use the real observables rather than predictions of the performance of the observing equipment and signal extraction pipeline , and especially by the fact that the alfalfa survey has actually outperformed its predictions , as discussed in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "hence , we follow a different method to determine the alfalfa completeness that makes no use of `` fake sources '' , but relies instead on the @xmath77.40 catalog itself . for a flux - limited sample from a uniformly distributed population , number counts will follow a power - law with an exponent of @xmath78 .",
    "we then can determine the onset of incompleteness when our data deviates from this form .",
    "briefly , the details of this method consist of the following steps :    1 .",
    "the code 1 sources are divided into 32 equally spaced bins in @xmath79 .",
    "2 .   for each width bin",
    ", we count the number n of detected sources in logarithmic intervals of flux density to determine the @xmath80 histogram ; apart from the impact of large scale structure in the survey volume , number counts are expected to follow a power - law with an exponent of @xmath78 .",
    "3 .   for each bin in @xmath79 , we plot @xmath81 versus @xmath31 ; see figure [ fig : lognlogs ] for three representative width bins",
    ". this distribution should be flat if all sources are accounted for .",
    "a downturn at low @xmath31 thus marks the onset of incompleteness .",
    "we fit an error function to each histogram ( red dashed lines ) and assume completeness over the well sampled range of @xmath31 over which the distribution shows a flat plateau .",
    "we calculate the integrated flux density where the alfalfa completeness crosses @xmath82% , @xmath83% , and @xmath84% ( vertical red lines mark the @xmath82% completeness in each bin ) . in practice ,",
    "the distributions drop off in the same in the same way , such that the 50% and 25% limits occur at a constant offset in @xmath85 from the 90% value across all bins .",
    "the values of @xmath86 for each w@xmath74 bin are then fit with the combinaton of two straight lines , similar to equation [ eq : eqnthresh90c1 ] , with a break at @xmath87 km s@xmath27 .",
    "the resulting @xmath82% completeness limit ( red solid line in upper panel of figure [ fig : fluxvsw ] ) for code 1 sources can be expressed as : @xmath88    where @xmath31 is in jy km s@xmath27 and @xmath29 is in km s@xmath27 . as mentioned before",
    ", the 50% and 25% completeness limits occur at a constant offset from the 90% value .",
    "the derived offsets for the code 1 sources only are : @xmath89    of the 15041  extragalactic objects in the @xmath2 sample , 3100  are categorized as code 2 detections ( low signal - to - noise detections with prior optical detection ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : fluxvsw ] shows the corresponding plot of the distribution of sources in the @xmath90 plane for the @xmath2 extragalactic catalog , including the code 2 detections which are shown as green symbols .",
    "these additional hi sources are expected to have a lower detection threshold , clearly evident in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fluxvsw ] .",
    "an analysis identical to the above can be performed including both the code 1 and 2 sources , yielding a relation for the combined catalog ( red solid , dash - dotted and dotted lines in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fluxvsw ] ) :    @xmath91    and    @xmath92    excluding the code 2 sources from the himf analysis as did @xcite guarantees that more confident detections with well - understood selection criteria are used .",
    "it could be argued that the use of sources of code 2 in the analysis could provide value added to the determination of the himf .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : limits ] . in practice",
    ", statistical studies requiring stringent requirements on sensitivity limits should use only code 1 sources and equation [ eq : eqnthresh90c1 ] . with the proper caution associated with the incomplete nature of code 2 sources",
    ", the combination of code 1 and code 2 sources and equation [ eq : eqnthresh90c12 ] can be used in studies which can benefit from a larger sample .    in both cases ,",
    "the 50% completeness limit can be considered the `` sensitivity limit '' of the survey , since it is the most relevant completeness limit for the derivation of galaxy statistical distributions , such as the himf and the hi width function . @xcite",
    "have shown that adopting a step function cut at the 50% completeness limit of a survey produces approximately the same statistical results as adopting the survey s full completeness function .",
    "the 25% completeness limit can be identified with the `` detection limit '' of the survey , that is the integrated flux density level below which a source has only a small chance of being detected and cataloged .",
    "we remind the reader that the quoted limits given here refer to the full @xmath77.40 catalog , and hence are representative of the average alfalfa datacube noise properties . however , because of variations in noise among and within grids and because some localized regions are entirely contaminated by rfi , limits on the hi flux density at arbitrary positions ( e.g. upper limits for non - detections ) must be computed individually , by specific inspection of the spectrum noise properties of the data cubes and their associated `` weights grid '' and the continuum maps .",
    "it is the availability of such ancillary information which enables the use of the full alfalfa dataset for stacking @xcite to probe statistical ensembles more deeply .",
    "as the previous generation blind hi survey , hipass @xcite set the standard for survey completeness ; by design , alfalfa was intended to surpass and supercede hipass .",
    "a reasonable comparison of the impact of the different source detection schemes ( including the absolute level of flux density sensitivity ) may be made by comparing the distribution of the highest - mass galaxies in hipass and alfalfa .",
    "for example , one might have anticipated that the original hipass peak - flux density detection scheme @xcite could bias the catalog against edge - on ( extremely wide ) profiles at the highest masses , and such a bias could explain the finding of @xcite that the hipass himf underestimated the number density of the highest mass galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : histbigw ] shows a comparison of the distribution of profile widths in @xmath2 ( open histogram ) and hipass ( filled histogram ) , for objects with log @xmath93 .",
    "no obvious difference which would explain a lack of high - mass sources in the hipass catalog is apparent . while the peak - flux density threshold detection could introduce such a bias , it is apparent that the matched filtering technique subsequently applied to the hipass dataset recovers high - width objects as does the technique used in alfalfa . instead , we attribute the lack of extremely high - mass sources in the hipass catalog to that survey s limited redshift extent and its lowered sensitivity near its bandpass redshift limit , both of which resulted in inadequate sampled volume and thus an undercounting of the rare , highest mass hi disks .    furthermore , because of its lower sensitivity , poorer angular and spectral resolution and source detection scheme , hipass was limited in its ability to probe the very low - mass and narrow - width hi sources .",
    "the spectrometer setup employed by hipass yielded a raw resolution of 13.2 km s@xmath27and of 18 km",
    "s@xmath27  after hanning smoothing ; the narrowest objects included in the hipass catalog have w@xmath74 = 30 km s@xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , alfalfa s velocity resolution is 11 km s@xmath27   after smoothing is applied , and the @xmath2 catalog thus includes sources with extremely narrow velocity widths .",
    "although the signal extraction algorithm adopted by @xcite applied a minimum template width of 30 km s@xmath27 , the refined final process of parameter extraction based on individual examination of the emission region permits finer width estimation .",
    "in fact , 289 of the extragalactic objects included in table [ tab : catalog ] have @xmath94 km s@xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig : loww ] examines the distributions of low hi mass systems and their profile velocity widths in the two surveys ; alfalfa is clearly superior in its ability to probe the lowest mass systems .",
    "this increased sensitivity to very narrow hi line emission enhances alfalfa s ability to probe the lowest hi masses , which in turn robustly constrains the faint - end slope of the hi mass function , @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , at the lowest hi masses , @xmath95 8.0 , the hipass catalog includes only 40 objects while the @xmath2 catalog contains 339 .",
    "the ability of alfalfa to sample narrower hi line sources is also critical for the derivation of the hi width function and its relation to the halo mass function @xcite .",
    "in drawing conclusions from blind hi surveys about the hi - selected population in the local universe , it is critical to understand the biases in the survey due to its sensitivity limits , uncertainties in the hi line flux densities and distances leading to uncertainties in the derived hi masses , and the impact of large - scale structure in the survey volume . @xcite use a subsample of alfalfa hi sources identified in low density environments to establish a standard of normal hi content and performed an analysis of the completeness of the particular version of the alfalfa catalog they used .",
    "@xcite ( see also martin 2011 ) provided an overview of important effects that impact the derivation of the himf by two different methods commonly used to derive mass and luminosity functions , namely the 1/v@xmath96 method and the two - dimensional stepwise maximum likelihood ( 2dswml ) method . in the context of applications such as the derivation of the himf by those two methods , we discuss here in greater detail the magnitude and character of @xmath2 survey properties , its limitations and biases .",
    "it is particularly important to understand these effects now because we anticipate the ` 100% alfalfa survey ' to be available in the near future .",
    "the large increase in the number of galaxies available for that analysis will decrease the statistical uncertainties on the measurements , thus amplifying the relative impact of systematics and biases .",
    "additionally , at that stage it will be less practical to create thousands of realizations to help understand the various effects . the results presented in this section",
    "will provide a baseline and dictate procedure for the final measurement of the hi mass function from the completed alfalfa survey .",
    "selection effects related to the code 2 sources in @xmath2 are poorly determined . because they require redshift information derived from other sources , they are subject to the limitations of the availability of such confirming data .",
    "additionally , alfalfa s sensitivity as a function of distance is strongly affected by rfi especially in the frequency range contaminated by the aviation radar at the san juan airport ( 1350 mhz , corresponding to @xmath97 km s@xmath27 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "@xcite included only objects with code 1 , detected within 15000 km s@xmath27 .",
    "yet it may be argued that the additional information contained in code 2 sources , dipping to lower flux limits , could provide additional insight . a first evaluation of the value added to the himf by code 2 sources relates to the observation that most code 2 sources fall near @xmath98 , a region of the himf well sampled by code 1 sources : the value added is likely thus to be negligible .",
    "we explore numerically this expectation .",
    "because of the requirement that code 2 sources be identified with an oc of known ( prior ) redshift , most often contributed by optical / ir surveys like sdss , those sources may be biased toward overdensities , toward those regions of the local volume that have been included in specific targeted or wide - area redshift surveys , such as the virgo cluster , and in particular toward those regions of the sky that have been covered in the spectroscopic catalogs of the sdss .",
    "does the inferred himf change if code 2 sources are included in its derivation ? we account for hi mass and flux density errors by creating 500 realizations of an himf that includes sources of both code 1 and code 2 , and compare those to 100 realizations of the fiducial himf published in @xcite which contained only the code 1 objects .",
    "we use the 2dswml method , but do not jackknife resample .",
    "as did @xcite , we restrict the analysis to the contiguous areas contained in @xmath2 and limited to c@xmath99 km s@xmath27 . over the same volume",
    ", the inclusion of code 2 sources increases the sample size used for this analysis from the 10,021 included in @xcite to 11,177 .",
    "figure [ fig : himfc2 ] displays the hi mass function found when code 2 sources are included in the analysis .",
    "the parameters of the function are not strongly affected by the inclusion of these sources .",
    "we find @xmath100 ( h@xmath101 mpc@xmath102dex@xmath27 ) = 4.8 @xmath54 .3 @xmath103 10@xmath102 , @xmath104(m@xmath105m@xmath106 + 2 @xmath107 h@xmath108 = 9.96 @xmath54 0.02 and @xmath77 = -1.29 @xmath54 0.02 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath109 4.1 @xmath54 0.3 @xmath110 h@xmath111 found by integrating the schechter function , or @xmath109 4.2 @xmath54 0.1 @xmath110 h@xmath111 when summing the binned measurements directly .",

    "encouragingly , these results indicate that the alfalfa survey s detection coding scheme does not systematically exclude significant sources of hi gas energy density in the local universe .",
    "rather , the agreement between the code 1 and the code 1 + 2 himfs suggest that our robust understanding of the survey s sensitivity extends to those weaker sources identified as code 2 objects .",
    "the only potentially significant impact is on the faint - end of the himf , influencing both the slope and the points there .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath77 is flattened in the code 1 + 2 case , though the two values are just barely within 1@xmath113 of each other . in figure",
    "[ fig : himfres ] , we compare the residuals ( the best - fit , fiducial himf schechter model , subtracted from the binned data ) for the case where we consider only code 1 objects ( top panel ) and the code 1 + 2 case ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that the code 1 + 2 himf measured fewer low - mass objects per unit volume , thereby yielding a flatter slope .",
    "this is unsurprising for , in comparison to hi surveys , optical surveys undersample dwarf , low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the typical code 2 detection is a galaxy near @xmath114 , and the redshift distribution of code 2 sources lacks the smattering of low redshift objects present in a hi - selected sample . as a result ,",
    "code 2s add very few additional sources at the lowest redshifts , at which low hi masses are detectable .",
    "this is an example of the fact that adding code 2 sources to the sample is more likely to subtract than to add value to the result : `` more is less '' .",
    "we note that in the process of source extraction , a second set of marginal hi line detections has been identified which coincide with possible ocs for which no redshift measurement is available .",
    "because the probability of these objects is yet too uncertain , they are not included in the current @xmath2 catalog .",
    "future followup observations to be made after the main survey is completed will be undertaken to confirm the reality of the hi line detections .",
    "this program will contribute additional low hi line flux density sources to the final alfalfa catalog in this region of the sky .",
    "( unfortunately ) we live on a planet occupied by technologically - active humans .",
    "figure 6 of @xcite illustrates the relative spectral weight within the 40% alfalfa survey volume as a function of observed heliocentric velocity .",
    "a relative weight of 1.0 indicates that the entire surveyed volume was accessible for source extraction and produced high - quality data .",
    "as also evident in the deficit of sources near a distance of @xmath0225 mpc seen in figure [ fig : spanplot ] , the faa radar at the san juan airport contaminates the frequencies corresponding to source at @xmath53 between 15000 and 16000 km s@xmath27 , rendering the detection of sources in this range impossible when the transmitter is on . beyond 16,000 km s@xmath27 , alfalfa s sensitivity recovers , but at the corresponding distance , it is sensitive only to the most massive of galaxies . as a result",
    ", this distant volume contributes only a small number of galaxies to the overall @xmath2 sample .    for these reasons ,",
    "the analysis of the himf in @xcite neglected galaxies beyond 15000 km s@xmath27 , so that the results would not be influenced by the large spectral weight gap .",
    "this exclusion was especially important in the case of the 2dswml method , since the 1/v@xmath96 method allows the inclusion of explicit corrections for known missing volumes .",
    "2dswml , by contrast , determines the shape of the himf by comparing counts in hi mass bins to a built - in description of alfalfa s flux density sensitivity as a function of distance and width .",
    "the large gap , which is not anticipated by this approach , may have caused problems in the analysis were those objects included .",
    "@xcite felt it was safer to limit the first measurement of the himf to regions where the spectral weights are relatively smooth , that is , to galaxies within 15000 km s@xmath27 .",
    "here , we revisit the issue and consider the influence , if any , of including the full redshift extent of the survey in the himf analysis .",
    "in particular , we would expect that the increased bin counts at the very highest hi masses may increase the statistical significance of the himf measurement there .",
    "such a possibility is of interest because @xcite determined that alfalfa is more sensitive to high - mass galaxies than hipass was , with himf results indicating that previous blind hi surveys have missed a significant percentage of the most massive hi disks . to test this possibility , we calculated the himf using both methods and using all of the code 1 sources out to 18,000 km s@xmath27 . for each method",
    ", we created 250 realizations of the survey to account for flux density , distance , and mass errors .",
    "the fit parameters and @xmath112 values are displayed in table [ tab : himf ] for both the 1/v@xmath96 and 2dswml methods .",
    "it is worth noting that the 2dswml result is distorted , likely because of the influence of the inaccessible volume and the inability of this method to correct for it .",
    "in fact , the 2dswml result drastically underestimates @xmath112 , shifts @xmath104 ( m@xmath115/m@xmath106 to a higher value , and flattens out the low - mass slope @xmath77 . on the other hand , the 1/v@xmath96 method continues to function as expected and results in a reliable measurement . both of the 1/v@xmath96 results are consistent with each other , including the measured values for @xmath112 , but the 2dswml method in the presence of the redshift gap performs poorly .",
    "this result confirms the decision by @xcite to limit their analysis to the volume within @xmath116 km s@xmath27 .",
    "this analysis provides further evidence of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two available methods for estimation of the himf . while the 2dswml approach provides a powerful statistical tool , it functions as a ` black box ' method that can not be manipulated by additional knowledge of the survey . in some cases",
    ", this may be an advantage , but in the case of alfalfa where we have detailed information about the survey volume , the survey sensitivity , and other factors contributing to the himf , the 1/v@xmath96 method provides a clearer path and a more understandable answer .      on the low hi mass end ,",
    "uncertainties in the conversion from hi line flux density to hi mass are the primary source of error on the himf . unlike the practice in the derivation of most himf results in the literature",
    ", the error analysis undertaken here and by @xcite has taken this explicitly into account .",
    "because the himf is based on binning galaxies by hi mass and then considering each bin as an independent data point , it is not straightforward to carry hi mass uncertainties through analytically . instead , the alfalfa himf s uncertainties due to mass errors are calculated through the creation of many hundreds of realizations , each with randomly assigned mass ( i.e. , distance and flux density ) errors . here ,",
    "we elaborate further on the distance estimate scheme used in alfalfa , the biases that would be introduced by using alternative schemes ( i.e. , a pure hubble flow model ) and the overall impact of distance and flux density errors on the hi mass estimates used to construct the himf .",
    "the distance estimation scheme adopted for alfalfa was described by @xcite and is summarized briefly here .",
    "when distances are based on the adopted flow model , we employ the model s error estimates , constrained by the fit of the model to the observed velocity fit . when distances are estimated using pure hubble flow , the error is estimated to be @xmath010% .",
    "we fix a minimum error of 163 km s@xmath27 , based on the local velocity dispersion measured by @xcite . to demonstrate the importance of using the full suite of available information to estimate distances , figure [ fig : dist ] compares the primary distances ( used in @xmath2 ) to the values that would be obtained assuming pure hubble flow .",
    "in their estimate of galaxy masses for the himf , the hipass team assumed hubble flow .",
    "this is not a safe assumption , particularly in the regions of the sky surveyed in @xmath2 .",
    "the virgo cluster , in particular , represents a strong deviation from any assumed relationship between distance and recessional velocity .",
    "@xcite showed the danger of assuming pure hubble flow , especially because of the small redshifts accessible to blind hi surveys .",
    "those authors concluded that the low - mass slope of the hipass himf was underestimated due to neglecting peculiar velocities , and predicted that a survey in the direction of virgo could severely underestimate the low - mass slope .",
    "given the large - scale structure in the @xmath2 volume , we would expect the himf to vary strongly if a poor choice of distance estimate were made . in order to test this ,",
    "we have re - calculated the 2dswml estimate of the himf using pure hubble flow to estimate distances .",
    "that is , we converted the observed heliocentric velocities into the cmb rest frame , and then assumed d@xmath117 = @xmath118 , where we adopt the alfalfa standard @xmath119 = 70 km s@xmath27mpc@xmath27 . in this case",
    ", we have no ideal estimate of the distance error , and therefore use 10% of the hubble flow distance or the local dispersion value 163 km s@xmath27 , whichever is greater . as usual ,",
    "flux density errors are also folded into the mass uncertainties .",
    "once again , we create 250 realizations to estimate uncertainties .",
    "the resulting hi mass function and schechter fit parameters are displayed in figure [ fig : himfhubble ] .",
    "as anticipated @xcite , the use of hubble flow has caused a serious underestimate of the faint - end slope @xmath77 .",
    "alfalfa s success at robustly measuring the himf depends not only on large sample size over a cosmologically significant volume , but also on the selection of a reasonable model for distance estimation .",
    "given the discussion of distance errors and their large impact on the himf and its uncertainties by @xcite , it is reasonable to ask how large are the hi mass errors when both distance and flux density errors in the @xmath2 sample are taken into account . to obtain robust estimates of hi mass errors",
    ", we created many thousand realizations of each galaxy in the @xmath2 sample and applied distance and flux density errors .",
    "the result , displayed in figure [ fig : massbin ] , compares the himf mass bin galaxies would nominally fall into assuming a perfect measurement of distance and flux density ( along the abscissa ) to the mean mass of the galaxies assigned to that bin once realistic uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "the horizontal uncertainties indicate the 1@xmath113 spread of potential ` true ' masses falling into nominally assigned mass bins . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that alfalfa s measurement of the himf and @xmath112 is not prone to large uncertainties above @xmath120 . in the mass range of interest to the missing satellites problem ,",
    "dwarf galaxy studies , and the low hi mass slope of the himf , that is below @xmath120 , galaxies can easily be mis - assigned to bins , even when a realistic distance model is being used . depending on the large - scale structure in the survey volume , this effect would lead to either an over- or under - estimate of @xmath77 .",
    "we therefore take great care to account , conservatively , for mass uncertainties .      because blind hi surveys are relatively shallow , with alfalfa probing the local universe only out to z @xmath0 0.06 , inhomogeneity in the survey volume",
    "has a strong impact on the derived hi mass function .",
    "this effect is particularly true in the case of the 1/v@xmath96 method , which is not as robust against large - scale structure , but the 2dswml method is not completely immune from these effects . to test the homogeneity of a sample ,",
    "the usual statistical test applied is the v / v@xmath96 test @xcite .",
    "much like the 1/v@xmath96 method , this test considers the maximum volume out to which each source in a survey can be detected . by comparing the actual volume",
    "the source was detected in to the accessible volume , homogeneity in the sample can be evaluated ; the expectation value @xmath121 is 0.5 in a homogeneous volume .    in the case of the @xmath2 volume , @xmath121 = 0.45",
    "this indicates that , at 40% completion , the survey does not yet contain enough volume to fully ` smooth out ' the effects of large - scale structure .",
    "this is reflected in figure [ fig : vvmax ] where @xmath121 is shown for each bin of hi mass . the most obvious feature in this figure ,",
    "the dip near log ( m@xmath122/m@xmath106 @xmath123 , is due to overdensities in the sample volume , primarily the virgo cluster .",
    "galaxies in those overdensities are found , preferentially , in those regions , rather than filling the full volume where alfalfa s sensitivity could detect them , causing this dip .",
    "it is clear that @xmath2 does not , yet , constitute a representative slice of the universe ; as the survey progresses , we anticipate that the full sample will pass the @xmath124 test .",
    "another , perhaps more intuitive , way to view the impact of voids and clusters in @xmath2 is to compare the redshift distribution of cataloged galaxies to the prediction based on the survey s selection function ( i.e. , the percentage of galaxies at a given distance that are detectable in alfalfa ) .",
    "the selection function is determined by the 2dswml analysis of the himf , and when combined with the measurement of the himf , predicts the redshift distribution for a homogeneously distributed set of galaxies selected from the himf .",
    "figure [ fig : zdistr ] compares this expectation to the observations in @xmath2 .",
    "the bumps and dips in the histogram represent under- and overdensities , respectively , in the survey volume .",
    "for example , the virgo cluster explains the enhancement near 1,000 km s@xmath27 .",
    "the pisces - perseus supercluster and its foreground void also make clear imprints on this figure .",
    "if @xmath2 does not represent a representative sampling of the universe , then statistical studies of the sample s characteristics , like the himf , may be subject to biases from large - scale structure .",
    "because of its size , we can make an assessment by the impact of large scale structure within separate subregions of the catalog .",
    "the @xmath2 sample is made up of 3 large , contiguous areas . in the northern galactic hemisphere",
    ", @xmath2 covers 07@xmath12530@xmath126 @xmath127 16@xmath12530@xmath126 in two separate blocks , 4@xmath12816@xmath129 and 24@xmath130 28@xmath129 .",
    "we refer to these subregions as @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . in the southern galactic hemisphere",
    ", @xmath2 covers 22@xmath125 @xmath127 03@xmath125 , 24@xmath13032@xmath129 , referred to as @xmath133 .",
    "the entire @xmath2 , combined together , covers enough cosmological volume for the effects of large - scale structure on the derivation of the himf to begin to become minimal , but reducing its coverage further leads to a situation in which the himfs derived for individual sub - regions are strongly affected by over- and under - densities within their volume .",
    "figure [ fig : himfsub ] displays the the himfs for the three subregions : @xmath131 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , from top to bottom . the fit parameters and values of @xmath112 are given in table [ tab : himfreg ] along with the fiducial 2dswml himf for the entire @xmath2 sample for comparison .",
    "the largest by a significant fraction is @xmath131 , and it contributes over 50% of the 10,000 galaxies in @xmath2 . as expected , the himf for this region , when isolated , follows the himf for the sample as a whole .",
    "because of the large volume in this region , the himf displayed in the top panel of figure [ fig : himfsub ] is smooth and featureless .    in the case of the smaller samples in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : himfsub ] , features due to large - scale structure are clearly visible .",
    "because of the inhomogeneity of the surveyed volume , the himfs do not follow the prescribed schechter function . in the case of the @xmath132 subsample ,",
    "the faint - end slope is better fit on its own , in which case it is measured to be @xmath77 = -1.4 @xmath54 0.1 .    in every case ,",
    "the ` bumps ' and wiggles in the sub - region himfs correspond to the cone diagram distributions in @xcite .",
    "in essence , the combination of the alfalfa survey s sensitivity and the scaling of survey volume with redshift leads to preferred distances for each of the hi mass bins in the himf ( or preferred hi masses for every distance in the survey ) .",
    "a dip , for example , in the himf corresponds to an overdensity at the preferred distance for those hi mass scales .",
    "while the 2dswml method has been designed to be less sensitive to large - scale structure , the volumes of these subregions are too small for these effects to average out .",
    "such techniques can only work with the data they are given , but the 1/v@xmath96 approach allows for explicit correction for known structures .",
    "when these corrections are included in the 1/@xmath136 analysis of these subregions , the ( unshown ) results are very similar to those provided here .",
    "these corrections are based on the iras point source catalog redshift survey ( pscz ; @xcite ) density correction ( see  [ lsscorr ] ) , but imperfections in this correction lead to the same bump and dip features .",
    "an additional weakness of the 1/v@xmath96 density correction is that the counts can only be increased for galaxies that do end up in the sample , making the correction significantly less useful in voids .",
    "by contrast , 2dswml essentially ` self - corrects ' for over- and underdense regions . rather than looking at volumes and scaling counts by 1/v@xmath96 , 2dswml constructs the relationship between bins by scaling the counts themselves and therefore automatically scales the himf downward for regions that are overdense and upward for regions that are underdense .",
    "this consideration of subregions within @xmath2 makes clear the impact that large - scale structure can have on blind hi surveys and the importance of cosmologically significant volumes before global conclusions can be drawn .",
    "as described in @xcite , the 1/v@xmath96 method can be corrected to account for large - scale structure in the survey volume .",
    "essentially , overdense regions are considered to represent more effective volume ( @xmath137 , rather than @xmath138 ) and vice versa for underdense regions , so that galaxies in various environments are weighted appropriately @xcite .    while this correction is successful , it does rely on datasets external to the alfalfa survey . in @xcite ,",
    "the density map derived from the pscz @xcite was used to correct for large - scale structure . however , other options exist , in particular other pscz maps ( smoothed to different levels ) and the density reconstruction derived from the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale structure correction used has a large influence on the final himf estimate ; a @xmath0 20% effect on the schechter parameters , compared to neglecting the density correction , was reported in @xcite .",
    "given the magnitude of the effect , it is important to consider the impact that a different choice would make . in particular , since this portion of himf analysis is likely to always rely on external information , examining it here may be helpful in the future for the 100% alfalfa sample .",
    "the parameter of interest reported by pscz is the overdensity @xmath139 , defined relative to the average number density of galaxies found in those surveys :    @xmath140    in the case of the alfalfa survey and the himf , we are primarily interested in the average value of @xmath139 interior to each source s maximum detectable distance or , in other words , the average value of @xmath139 in the volume over which the source could have been detected .",
    "both the 2mrs and pscz density maps report the value of @xmath139 in equal - volume cells throughout their survey volume .",
    "the pscz map was chosen because of its greater sensitivity in the nearby survey regions of @xmath2 , where the himf was especially vulnerable to the impact of large - scale structure .    while pscz was a good choice for the analysis of the @xmath2 himf , there are actually several choices of maps available from @xcite , with the primary differences being the smoothing size of each volume cell and the maximum distance out to which the density fields were reconstructed . in @xcite ,",
    "the chosen map extended to 240 @xmath141 mpc and was smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width 3.2 @xmath141 mpc .",
    "the alternative options include a map that extends to only 120 @xmath141 mpc with a 3.2 @xmath141 mpc kernel , and one that extends to 240 @xmath141 mpc with a larger gaussian kernel of 7.7 @xmath141 mpc .",
    "the smoothing scale of pscz maps can lead to underestimation of density contrasts . because the primary effect of the large - scale structure correction is on the lowest - mass bins of the himf , it is important to explore and understand the influence of this outside dataset .    upon examination of the average interior overdensities determined for @xmath2 in each map , we find that the pscz.240.g3.2 map used in @xcite for the 1/v@xmath96 analysis of the himf represents an extreme estimate of the impact of large - scale structure within the survey volume .",
    "it is the most conservative option , given that it attaches lower weight to those galaxies found in nearby overdensities , particularly the virgo cluster , to prevent them from artificially boosting the faint - end slope .    in order to quantify the effect of these options on the resulting himf",
    ", we use the pscz.120.g3.2 and pscz.240.g7.7 to re - analyze the @xmath2 himf .",
    "where the maps do not reach the full redshift extent of the @xmath2 sample , we set the average interior @xmath139 to 0 for galaxies beyond the distance limit . in order to fit schechter function parameters in each case",
    ", we use the same uncertainty estimates for each hi mass bin point as presented in @xcite , as the pscz map applied would only change the magnitude of each point and not its fluctuation due to hi mass uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : himfpscz ] shows the results , focusing on the low - mass end of the himf , since hi mass bins with @xmath142 are not affected by the large - scale structure volume correction .",
    "the different large - scale structure corrections function effectively as a scaling in each bin , so that each option follows the fiducial case closely .",
    "both pscz.120.g3.2 and pscz.240.g7.7 boost the faint - end slope , indicating that they are overcounting galaxies in the nearby overdensities , namely the virgo cluster .",
    "this analysis verifies that pscz.240.g3.2 was the most conservative choice for correcting the 1/v@xmath96 himf for the effects of large - scale structure .",
    "the changes to the low - mass slope @xmath77 and the turnover mass m@xmath115 are displayed in table [ tab : himfpscz ] , along with the measured 2dswml parameters for reference .",
    "it is clear that the pscz map with the greatest extent and the smallest smoothing radius is most appropriate for estimating the @xmath2 hi mass function .",
    "this paper presents the catalogued parameters for 15855  hi line detections extracted from @xmath143 deg@xmath1  of high galactic latitude sky observed by the alfalfa survey .",
    "a ( pleasant ) surprise for us has been the higher than expected alfalfa detection rate , 5.6 sources per deg@xmath1 , or , including only the objects that are certainly extragalactic , 5.3 sources per deg@xmath1 .",
    "this latter detection value is a factor of 29 times greater than the rate of 0.18 sources per deg@xmath1   achieved by hipass .",
    "the characteristic resolution of the alfalfa spectral grids is about 4@xmath144 ; the positions of the hi sources can be determined to an accuracy typically better than 20 .",
    "using the publicly available sdss and dss2 imaging datasets , we have assigned probable optical counterparts to more than 98% of the 15041  extragalactic detections and provide a cross - reference to the sdss dr7 photometric and imaging databases .",
    "an additional 814   hi line detections can not be identified with stellar counterparts but lie within velocity ranges characteristic of the galactic / circumgalactic hvcs .",
    "roughly 3/4 of the optically `` dark '' extragalactic hi sources are located in fields containing galaxies of known optical redshift ; many are likely to be associated with tidal debris fields .",
    "we identify four objects as candidate oh megamasers redshifted to @xmath61 ; one of those is a rediscovery of a previously recognized ohm and is associated with a galaxy of the same optical redshift @xcite .",
    "future works will explore more systematically the ohm candidates throughout the alfalfa bandpass and also will search for evidence of hi in absorption @xcite .",
    "unsurprisingly , a census of the hi bearing population of galaxies in the local universe is strongly biased against galaxies on the red sequence , but some luminous , red galaxies are detected in the hi line .",
    "in particular , alfalfa provides a rich sampling of the low - to - moderate density universe at @xmath145 .    as a major alfalfa data release",
    ", the @xmath2 catalog presented here supercedes the datasets published by our team previously . in particular , the hi line flux densities reported here",
    "are based on further improvements in the software used for parameter extraction and increased knowledge of the system performance .",
    "the alfalfa reduction pipeline may miss flux for sources which are very large compared to the beam size and offset from the center of the standard grids , but comparison with the hi line flux densities derived from pointed single dish observations and corrected for beam dilution and pointing errors with the ones reported here shows no systematic offsets except for the very largest and very strongest sources .",
    "the latter will need to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis in grids produced and analyzed separately from the standard process and where applicable , corrected for sidelobe contamination @xcite .",
    "the goals and expectations of the alfalfa survey were outlined in @xcite and survey source sensitivity and reliability was discussed in @xcite . as discussed previously , the integrated hi line flux density threshold of a blind hi survey like alfalfa increases with hi line profile width @xcite . with the availability of the large @xmath2 dataset , we test those expectations and give quantitative descriptions of the completeness and sensitivity of the alfalfa survey as functions of @xmath79 .",
    "in addition to the highest quality , highly reliable ( code 1 ) hi detections , the @xmath2 catalog presented in table [ tab : catalog ] includes also sources of lower s / n which coincide in position and redshift with known optical galaxies ( the `` priors '' ) . because the availability of such prior information is highly dependent on the selection functions of other surveys , these additional objects should not be used in studies which require stringent consideration of statistical completeness .",
    "however , the vast majority are likely to be valid hi detections and hence they can be included in studies where the number of sources is most critical ( e.g. , peculiar velocity studies ) .",
    "future work will be undertaken to confirm these detections and an additional set of low s / n possible detections which coincide with galaxies of unknown redshift .    the sensitivity of alfalfa and the thorough understanding of its performance enable a robust measurement of the himf , and in particular , of its faint - end slope @xmath77 and the energy density of neutral hydrogen @xmath112 at @xmath67 = 0 .",
    "on the low - mass end of the himf , alfalfa improves on previous blind hi surveys in terms of sample size , angular and spectral resolution , sampling of cosmic volume , and assumptions of pure hubble flow . at the lowest hi masses ,",
    "alfalfa s finer velocity resolution is an important factor in obtaining a full count of the gas - rich dwarf population .    on the high - mass end",
    ", previous hi surveys have overlooked the locally - rare population of very massive hi disks .",
    "we have evaluated the possible impact on the derived himf of missing sources at both the broad and narrow width ends , particularly in comparison with the hipass catalog @xcite .",
    "we conclude that hipass did not recognize the richness of the very high hi mass population , not because it failed to identify the systems with the broadest widths but because it did not have adequate sensitivity at large distances and was limited to only 64 mhz of bandpass .",
    "it is alfalfa s combination of sensitivity , spectral and angular resolution , frequency and sky coverage which yields a robust census of the hi bearing population at @xmath146 .    with alfalfa still",
    "only 40% complete , we have shown that the 2dswml and 1/@xmath136 methods yield results on the himf in good agreement , but that the loss of significant volume in the alfalfa survey beyond 15000 km s@xmath27 reduces the performance of the 2dswml approach if that region is included .",
    "a realistic treatment of distance and flux density uncertainties , translated into mass uncertainties , avoids the strong bias in @xmath77 and the shape of the himf introduced by an assumption of hubble flow in the local volume .",
    "while @xmath2 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of the local cosmological volume , our method for including the impact of large - scale structure is a conservative choice , and future data releases from alfalfa will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we look forward to completing the alfalfa survey .",
    "we thank the staff of the arecibo observatory , particularly phil perillat , ganesh rajagopalan , arun venkataraman , hector hernandez , and the telescope operations staff , for their invaluable help in support of the acquisition of the data used to produce this catalog , and tom shannon and adam brazier for their critical support of hardware and database development at cornell .",
