    "today we have at our disposal a well - elaborated technique for perturbatively treating field theory at finite temperature and/or chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this formalism goes far beyond the ordinary @xmath6 perturbation theory insofar as a correct treatment of infrared divergences ( specifically those which are connected with @xmath7 ) requires partial resummation of infinitely many specific diagrams .",
    "this implies  among other things  that the infrared convergent perturbative expressions come out as series in @xmath8 ( the fundamental coupling constant ) rather than in @xmath9 [ or @xmath10 .    during the last decade ,",
    "several physical quantities , the most prominent example being the free energy density @xmath11 of the quark - gluon plasma , have been calculated within this formalism up to @xmath12 @xcite and ( partially ) even to @xmath13 @xcite disappointingly , in spite of the relatively high orders available , the results are of very limited applicability even at very high temperatures ( @xmath14 tev ) where @xmath8 certainly becomes small .",
    "in fact , if successive terms in the perturbative series are added , the corresponding truncated sum changes dramatically , jumping up and down .",
    "furthermore , the unphysical dependence on the renormalization scale is strong and seems to become even stronger with increasing order ( the renormalization scale in @xmath15 scheme will be denoted as @xmath16 , and in a general scheme as @xmath17 ) .",
    "both effects considerably reduce the reliability of the perturbative results for representing physical quantities and have therefore been object of intensive theoretical studies .",
    "ways out of the convergence dilemma are in general looked for by either performing some clever resummations or by reorganizing perturbation theory in some way ( actually , in some cases , this amounts to the same thing ) @xcite .",
    "several specific approaches have been applied up to now . among them",
    "are quasi - particle models @xcite , @xmath18-derivable approximations @xcite , screened @xcite or optimized @xcite perturbation theory , hard thermal loop perturbation theory @xcite .    within the present paper",
    "we concentrate mainly on the question of renormalization scale ( rs @xmath16 ) dependence of the resummed results , in @xmath15 scheme , as well as on the dependence of the results on the yet unknown part of the @xmath19-term in truncated perturbation series .",
    "the resummation approaches mentioned above do have some residual renormalization scale dependence .",
    "furthermore , the conventional choice for the rs @xmath16 at finite @xmath5 ( @xmath20 ) is not natural since different energy scales get involved in all calculations ( see later ) .    in order to improve this situation",
    ", we replace the ( partially resummed ) perturbation series by approximants which are more stable under the variation of @xmath16 .",
    "the pad approximants ( pa s ) @xcite and other pad - related resummations , such as borel - pad ( bpa s ) @xcite and modified baker - gammel approximants ( mbga s ) @xcite , are known in general to reduce the unphysical @xmath16-dependence significantly ( mbga s even entirely ) .",
    "usually these approximants are applied to a given truncated perturbation series ( tps ) of a given order , and they fulfill in addition the `` minimal '' requirement : upon re - expanding them in powers of the coupling parameter , they reproduce the tps to the given order . in this sense",
    "they are sometimes considered to be some sort of mathematical artifice without any deeper physical motivation .",
    "this opinion is delusive , however , because of several reasons :    1 .",
    "the basis of all field theoretic approaches is the path integral expression for the generating functional which has to be attributed a specific mathematical meaning . in ordinary perturbation theory",
    "this is achieved by taylor expanding the corresponding exponential of the interaction lagrangian leading to the well - known power series . but",
    "this is by no means better or more natural than by approximating it in terms of other approximants ( e.g. , pad )  we are only less used to it . in some sense pad or pad - related sequences",
    "seem even more adapted than power series since they allow for ( pole ) singularities , and we know that most physical amplitudes do include singularities .",
    "2 .   the asymptotically divergent nature of the expansion in powers of the coupling parameters represents a practical problem concerning the actual evaluation , and calls for , among other things , nonperturbative information in order to fix the renormalon ambiguities and to produce unique predictions . on the other hand , due to the generally better convergence of pad and pad - related approximants",
    ", one hopes that the convergence of the corresponding sequence of the ( pad-)resummed tps s will improve and that it would converge to a specific prediction .",
    "the pad sequence , in fact , with increasing order shows convergence under rather general conditions even when the corresponding tps is ( asymptotically ) divergent @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that pa s ( and mbga s ) can be represented by weighted averages of running coupling parameter ( one - loop running in the case of pa , exact running in the case of mbga ) at specific values of reference momenta @xcite , and are thus a realization of the fact that each physical quantity in field theory is characterized by specific values of the momentum flow . in this sense",
    "they represent different approximations to the neubert s formalism @xcite of renormalization improved perturbation theory .    from the diagrammatic point of view ,",
    "pa and pad - related methods represent a resummation of those ( infinitely many ) diagrams which  when added  approximately ( or exactly ) cancel the @xmath16-dependence of the given quantity .",
    "pa s , bpa s and mbga s have been applied to tps for several qcd or qed quantities at zero temperature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and have often led to significant improvement of the rs - dependence problem .",
    "recently , same types of approximation have also been used for similar purposes in finite temperature gauge theory : pa s in refs .",
    "@xcite ; somewhat related borel methods in refs .",
    "@xcite , by discerning some information on renormalons ( for renormalon properties in @xmath21 theory at finite @xmath5 , see ref .",
    "the first pa resummations at finite-@xmath5 @xcite consisted in simply replacing the available power series ( in powers of @xmath8 ) for the entire qcd free energy by various pa s .",
    "although the results demonstrate a weakened @xmath16-dependence , we regard some aspects of this approach as problematic .",
    "our reservation is due to the simple observation that two ingredients  ( a ) the infrared stable tps of thermal field theory , and ( b ) the pad(-related ) approximations applied to this tps  imply resummation of infinitely many terms .",
    "the corresponding classes of diagrams are , however , neither equivalent nor disjunct .",
    "therefore , care has to be taken to avoid double counting and to disentangle the various resummations .",
    "recently , we have developed a formalism to consistently treat this problem @xcite .",
    "the procedure is the following : consider some physical quantity and its tps ( to a given order ) in thermal field theory .",
    "we specifically have in mind the static pressure @xmath22 of the qcd plasma , i.e. , the negative of the free energy density @xmath23 .",
    "it is connected to the partition function @xmath24 by the relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( euclidean ) qcd - lagrangian density , @xmath5 is the temperature , @xmath27 is the three - dimensional volume , and the renormalization convention @xmath28 is taken ; @xmath8 is the qcd gauge coupling parameter .",
    "the corresponding tps has the generic structure @xmath29 \\ , \\label{pexp}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath30 may include contributions of order @xmath31 . the terms proportional to odd powers of @xmath8 [ or , equivalently , fractional powers of @xmath32",
    "are exclusively due to resummation of specific ( ring , or daisy ) diagrams , but the latter also contribute to terms proportional to even powers of @xmath8 . clearly @xmath8 and the coefficients @xmath30 depend on the chosen renormalization scheme and , in particular , on the renormalization scale @xmath16 ( @xmath33 ) . due to the asymptotic freedom",
    "we expect that @xmath8 becomes sufficiently small at large temperature @xmath5 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on such a large-@xmath5 situation .    the first step needed for the application of the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite is the separation in eq .",
    "( [ pexp ] ) of the purely perturbative part from the contributions stemming from the ( ring-)resummations . this can be done in an unambiguous and consistent way , since the resummation terms represent exclusively the contributions of the ( bosonic ) zero modes to the considered physical quantity .",
    "note in this respect that resummation is needed purely for taming the finite-@xmath5 infrared divergences , and only the infrared parts of the higher order diagrams contribute to the ( finite ) order terms .",
    "therefore , the identification of the contributions from the zero modes ( long - range contributions ) is needed .",
    "this can be achieved either by integrating out directly the high momentum regime or , more elegantly , by utilizing the effective field formalism @xcite based on dimensional reduction method refs .",
    "the idea behind is that ( at high enough temperature , with @xmath8 sufficiently small ) the four - dimensional thermal qcd at length scales @xmath34 is equivalent to an effective three - dimensional field theory of ( static ) boson fields .",
    "this effective theory represents the physics of the zero bosonic modes and thus reproduces all static correlations of the original qcd at the aforementioned distances .",
    "consequently , the contribution of the zero modes to the partition functions or to the pressure can be calculated by means of the effective theory .",
    "within qcd the long - distance part can be further subdivided corresponding to the two regimes @xmath35 ( determined by color - electric screening ) and @xmath36 ( color - magnetic screening ) . denoting the corresponding contributions to @xmath37 ( or @xmath11 ) by the subscripts",
    "m and g , respectively , the final decomposition corresponding to the three energy regions is @xmath38 here , @xmath39 denotes the short - distance , and @xmath40 the zero - mode long - distance contribution",
    ".    now comes one of the main points of the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite : having the separation ( [ pdecomp ] ) of the pressure into @xmath39 and @xmath41 , we can argue that both are separately physical quantities , and thus both , when calculated to all orders , are separately @xmath16-independent .",
    "the reason for it is shown by the following indirect argument : consider any ( static ) two - point - correlator within the given field theory .",
    "it is a measurable quantity and so is its long - range behaviour .",
    "but the latter is determined solely by the exchange of zero modes ( note that the exchange of a mode with frequency @xmath42 contributes a term to the correlator which vanishes like @xmath43 at @xmath44 , thus the only surviving contribution at large distances is the one with @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus the contribution of @xmath46 to each correlator is measurable ( and therefore @xmath16-independent ) once we have fixed , by convention , the minimal value @xmath47 of what we consider large distances ( or : factorization scale @xmath48 ) .",
    "since these correlators are derived from the partition function @xmath24 by means of functional derivatives , even the zero - mode contribution to @xmath24 , and thus also to @xmath37 , is @xmath16-independent ( physical ) .",
    "consequently , the remaining part of the measurable pressure  the short - range contribution @xmath39 represented by the ordinary perturbative terms  must also be @xmath16-independent . the rs - independence of both parts separately has been demonstrated analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the known perturbation series ( up to order @xmath49 ) .",
    "the separation and the @xmath16-independence of the separate terms allows a more consistent application of pad and pad - related approximations : they are applied to tps s of each quantity @xmath39 and @xmath41 separately .",
    ", we will find it more convenient to apply pad(-related ) resummations to @xmath41 and not separately to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "] we can illustrate the importance of using separate approximations with a simple example  the pad - resummation of a quantity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are separately physical quantities , each of them available as power series of @xmath55 up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) : @xmath56 when we apply to the tps of the sum @xmath57 a pa , say @xmath58(a)$ ] , and then expand this back in powers of the coupling @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath59 } & = &   2~a \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(r_{(1)}\\!+\\!r_{(2 ) } ) a \\right]^{-1 }   = 2~a \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(r_{(1)}\\!+\\!r_{(2 ) } ) a + \\frac{1}{4 } ( r_{(1)}^2 + r_{(2)}^2 + 2 r_{(1 ) } r_{(2 ) } ) a^2   \\right ] + { \\cal { o}}(a^4 ) \\ . \\label{sp11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient at @xmath60 here has a term @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the pad - resummed @xmath57 contains mixing effects at @xmath60 , i.e. , an interference effect between the two amplitudes for the physical observables @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is not acceptable , because @xmath57 is the ( incoherent ) sum of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the pa should not be applied to the entire sum @xmath57 , but separately to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this argument holds also when different pa s or pad - related resummations are applied , and when the order of the tps is higher .",
    "one of the consequences of the separate treatment of @xmath39 and @xmath41 is that the natural renormalization scale @xmath16 used in these two quantities should be of the order of the energy of the modes contributing to them : @xmath62 in @xmath39 , and @xmath63 in @xmath41 .    within the present paper",
    "we will apply pad ( pa ) and borel - pad approximants ( bpa s ) to the evaluation of @xmath22 .",
    "the modified baker - gammel approximants ( mbga s ) , which are @xmath16-independent @xcite or even renormalization scheme independent @xcite , are technically more involved . an analysis with mbga s , which at least could serve as some kind of quality control of the general procedure , will be presented elsewhere . on the other hand ,",
    "bpa s are also applied here and they represent an extension of the pad analysis : pa s are applied to the corresponding tps s of the borel transforms , and then the resummed quantity is obtained by borel integration .",
    "this procedure gets its motivation from the hope that the borel summation might defuse the notorious divergence problem of perturbation theory , as well as from the fact that the power expansion of the borel transform has significantly better convergence properties than the original series and is thus more amenable to the pad - type resummations .",
    "one technical remark should be added here  the separation of the energy range into a high and a low energy region requires introduction of a factorization scale @xmath64 which defines a boundary between the two : @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , the two contributions separated in the described way acquire an artificial dependence on @xmath66 , although the sum of the two terms @xmath67 has to be @xmath66-independent .",
    "similarly , for the individual terms @xmath39 and @xmath41 to have physical meaning themselves , the factorization scale should be suitably chosen .",
    "technically this means that the approximants for @xmath39 and @xmath41 , although independent of each other , should be chosen such that the @xmath64-dependence is minimized .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we applied this procedure to calculation of the free energy ( pressure ) both in qcd with @xmath68 ( massless ) quarks and in a @xmath21-theory . at that time",
    "the relevant tps s had been calculated only up to terms of order @xmath69 with the following implications for the perturbative structure of the relevant contributions : the short - distance term @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is determined perturbatively up to nlo [ in @xmath72 @xmath73 and so is the electric ( debye ) screening mass @xmath74 @xmath75 the long - distance part was a power series in @xmath8 [ @xmath76 up to order @xmath9 @xmath77 we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for compilation of explicit expressions for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "these are rather short power series and they allow construction of only low order pad approximants , e.g. , pa @xmath58(a)$ ] for @xmath70 and @xmath2 , and pa @xmath83(g_s)$ ] for @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , the tps for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is very strongly divergent , and the tps s for @xmath86 and for @xmath87 are divergent to a somewhat lesser extent .",
    "therefore , resummation results based on these tps s should be taken with care . nevertheless , the application of these low order approximants yielded results which were fairly stable under the variation of @xmath16 , although  at low temperatures @xmath88 gev  they deviated substantially from the lattice results @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , an additional order in the perturbation series ( i.e. , terms of order @xmath19 ) is much more than an additional tiny correction , but constitutes a significant enlargement of the basis for pad approximations , since it adds additionally both to @xmath70 and @xmath89 and ( for the first time non - vanishingly ) to @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the @xmath91 contribution to the long - range part of the pressure published in ref .",
    "@xcite is extremely gratifying .",
    "the full @xmath92 contribution can not be achieved perturbatively because of the well - known breakdown of perturbation theory due to incurable infrared divergences occurring at this order @xcite .",
    "what can be evaluated is the coefficient of the logarithmic ultraviolet divergence contained in @xmath90 , because of the superrenormalizability of the corresponding effective three - dimensional field theory ; and this is exactly the coefficient of the @xmath93-term in @xmath90 . the term purely proportional to @xmath19 remains unspecified and has to be treated as a free parameter unless information from nonperturbative methods ( e.g. , lattice calculations ) is inferred .    within the present paper",
    "we will utilize the new results @xcite on the perturbation expansion of the qcd - pressure as much as possible in order to find approximants which are reasonably stable under rs - variation .",
    "this gives us the freedom of using higher order pad or borel - pad approximants and thus treating the long - range part @xmath41 ( @xmath94 ) in a more reliable way .",
    "unfortunately , the full four - loop contribution to the short - range part @xmath39 ( @xmath95 ) , which is in principle perfectly calculable within ordinary perturbation theory and would yield @xmath96 correction to eq .",
    "( [ tfelow ] ) , is not yet available at the moment .",
    "therefore , we have no direct basis for improving the approximants to @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , we can obtain some restricted information about the @xmath13-terms in @xmath39 from the requirement that @xmath39 be @xmath16-independent and @xmath97 be @xmath66-independent . a constant ( @xmath16- and @xmath66-independent ) term in the coefficient at @xmath13 in @xmath39",
    "still remains unspecified , but its value can roughly be estimated .",
    "the new results of ref .",

    "[ sec : pes ] we describe the separation of the qcd - pressure into contributions stemming from different energy regions and specify the known corresponding effective lagrangians .",
    "we then present the available perturbation expansion of the long- and the short - range contributions and work out the effects of the factorization scales @xmath64 and @xmath98 ( which have not been explicitly disentangled in ref .",
    "@xcite because of their simplified treatment of the rs - dependence ) . in sec .",

    "a short compilation of the pad and borel - pad approximants is given in the appendix .",
    "the basic information about the physics of a quark - gluon system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath5 is contained in the expression for the pressure @xmath99 or , equivalently , the free energy density @xmath100 . in @xmath101 dimensions @xmath102 this is given by eqs .",

    "let us recall also , that the specific choices for the approximants which entered in figs .",
    "[ pemgeffvstco ] and [ pemgeffmvstco ] were based on the following reasoning : a tps at a given order , in principle , allows for various pad and borel - pad approximants .",
    "we chose those approximants which give results reasonably stable under the variation of the corresponding renormalization scales @xmath261 and @xmath355 , and of the factorization scale @xmath66 .",
    "this physical criterion led us to two possible approximants : bp[0/3 ] and p[0/3 ] for @xmath199 ; in both cases bp[1/2 ] for @xmath226 .",
    "they differed from each other significantly in the low temperature regime , cf .",
    "[ pemgvstb03](b ) . in order to further eliminate one of them ( bp[0/3 ] ) , we had to apply an additional physically motivated criterion , namely that the predicted pressure should be smaller than the ideal gas value if the temperature @xmath5 is sufficiently near the critical value @xmath319 .",
    "in addition , two numerical arguments were provided which also support the elimination of the approxmant bp[0/3 ] for @xmath199 .",
    "thereby we ended up with the approximants bp[1/2 ] for @xmath226 ( @xmath399 ) and p[0/3 ] for @xmath199 ( @xmath400 ) which are considered as our `` best approximants '' .    since both are of pad type",
    ", we expect that they also have a better convergence behavior than the ordinary truncated perturbation theories .",
    "this , in fact , can be tested explicitly and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ pemgconv ] , where we demonstrate the behavior of the pad and borel - pad resummed curves , for @xmath241 , when the order of expansions ( [ pe2 ] ) and ( [ pmgeff ] ) for @xmath226 and @xmath199 increases , and compare them with the corresponding tps evaluations . for all the curves here , including the tps curves , the eqcd parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 were evaluated as @xmath197}(a(\\mu_m))$ ] , as in figs .",

    "[ pemgeffvstco ] , the upper is the central curve of fig .",
    "[ pemgeffmvstco ] . in fig .",
    "[ pemgconv ] we see that the tps results change strongly when the order of the tps is increased ; on the contrary the resummed results suffer weaker changes , although a clear convergence at @xmath406 gev still can not be seen at these orders .",
    "the crucial point of our approach was to treat separately the short - distance ( @xmath39 ) and long - distance ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath41 ) quantities  using in them the renormalization ( and factorization ) scales which correspond roughly to the physical scales of the considered quantities , and then performing either pad or borel - pad resummation of each quantity .",
    "in this way we arrive at predictions for pressure which have weak dependence on the unknown parameters @xmath215 and @xmath164 , and on the high - energy renormalization scale @xmath261 ( @xmath107 ) of @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the predicted pressure on the renormalization scale @xmath276 ( @xmath195 ) of @xmath41 is still large at @xmath4 gev when the eqcd @xmath191-term in the eqcd expansion ( [ pmgeff ] ) is added separately as a power of the qcd coupling parameter @xmath351 [ eq .  ( [ l1a ] ) ] .",
    "this @xmath250-dependence becomes significantly weaker when the eqcd @xmath191-term is instead added separately as a power of the first eqcd coupling parameter @xmath193 [ eq .  ( [ l1b ] ) ] .",
    "further , the resummed results change reasonably slowly when the order of the tps s , on which they are based , is increased .    on the other hand",
    ", simple tps evaluations do not yield reasonable results for the long - distance quantities at low temperatures , because the tps s at such low energy scales have strong dependence on the unknown parameters and on the renormalization scales , and change strongly when the order of the tps s is increased .",
