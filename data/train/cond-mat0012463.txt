    "since the observation of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases in 1995 @xcite , an unresolved issue in the theory of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) is the qauntum state of the condensate @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in the standard theory of bec , which applies in the thermodynamic limit , the quantum state is one of well defined phase , @xmath1 .",
    "this state corresponds to a broken @xmath0 gauge symmetry @xcite@xcite .",
    "because particle number , @xmath2 , and phase obey the uncertainty relation @xmath3 @xcite , a state of well defined phase implies uncertainty in the particle number .",
    "again , this result is based on assumptions which are valid only in the thermodynamic limit in which @xmath4 the second quantized hamiltonian for a system of bosons is expressed in terms of the bosonic field operator , @xmath5 and its adjoint which annihilate and create a particle at position @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under the global @xmath0 transformation , @xmath7 the @xmath8 symmetry implies a conserved noether charge which corresponds to the total number of particles .",
    "when a bose - einstein condensate is present , a single quantum state becomes macroscopically occupied and it is assumed that the field operator acquires a nonvanishing expectation value ,    @xmath9    with respect to the condensate state . here , @xmath10 is the order parameter for the condensate .",
    "however , @xmath10 is no longer invariant under the transformation , @xmath11 which implies that the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the condensate . equation ( [ sbgs ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are  like  condensate states which differ by one particle @xcite@xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath15 disappears , in which case the condensate is in a coherent state , @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be identified with the wave function for the quantum state in which bose condensation has occurred ( with the wave function normalization @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear that eq .",
    "( [ sbgs ] ) is still applicable when @xmath2 is finite .",
    "examples of bec in condensed matter physics such as superfluid he may have @xmath19 whereas trapped atomic gases typically have @xmath20    in fact , there are two immediate objections to the use of a coherent state for finite particle number .",
    "first , at zero temperature , one expects that the _ true _ ground state of the condensate will be a number state ( i.e. a fock state ) with no _ quantum _ fluctuations in the particle number even if we are ignorant of what that number is . also ,",
    "since the hamiltonian for the system is @xmath0 symmetric , one must introduce a symmetry breaking field into the hamiltonian in order to define the phase of the condensate @xcite . the symmetry breaking field vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , there is no physical interaction which corresponds to this symmetry breaking term and as such , it simply amounts to a mathematical trick @xcite .",
    "the general definition of a bose - einstein condensate due to penrose and onsager @xcite is that the single particle density matrix , @xmath21 , does not vanish as for large separations , @xmath22 although eq .",
    "( [ odlro ] ) is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ sbgs ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ odlro ] ) simply requires the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state and will therefore be true for a condensate that is in a number state .",
    "_ have shown that , for small condensates ( @xmath23 ) described initially by a coherent state , the order parameter undergoes collapses and revivals such that @xmath24 during the collapse but eq .",
    "( [ odlro ] ) remains valid at all times since @xmath25 is unaffected by the phase diffusion which causes the collapse and revivals @xcite .",
    "this implies that a coherent state description is inappropriate for small @xmath2 since it is not an energy eigenstate of the system .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite where the depedence of the collapse and revival times on the dimensionality of the condensate and the trapping potential was studied .",
    "in contrast , barnett _ et al . _ have argued that the best pure state description of a condensate is the coherent state since it is the most robust state with respect to interactions with the environment @xcite . in short ,",
    "there appear to be no conclusive arguments for or against a coherent state description of atomic bec s .",
    "since a coherent state has a well defined phase , the appearance of interference fringes in the atomic density for two overlapping condensates would be an indication that the condensates were in coherent states ( or some other superposition of number states such that one could ascribe a phase to the condensate ) .",
    "however , javanainen and yoo have shown that even if the two condensate states are initially in number states , there will be an observable interference pattern @xcite .",
    "this is because the destructive detection of atoms creates an uncertainty in the relative number of atoms in the two condensates since it not known from which condensate the detected atom came from .",
    "consequently , with each atom detection , the relative phase between the two condensates becomes more precisely defined .",
    "thus , any interference experiment based on destructive detection of atoms will not be able to distinguish between two condensates initially in number states or coherent states .",
    "similar work has shown that the detection of spontaneously scattered photons between two condensates can establish a relative phase between the condensates even when the condensates are initially in number states @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we propose a method for distinguishing between a condensate that is in a number state and a coherent state .",
    "the method is based ramsey s separated oscillatory field technique @xcite in a two - component condensate such as @xmath26 @xcite . such an experiment has recently been performed by hall _",
    "et al . _ at jila @xcite .",
    "ramsey s technique , as applied to two - level atoms initially in their ground states , consists of applying two ",
    "@xmath27-pulses  generated by an external field of frequency @xmath28 which couple the ground state and excited state .",
    "these pulses are separated by a time @xmath29 .",
    "the first pulse puts each of the atoms into a superposition of the ground and excited states with equal population .",
    "the relative phase between the two states then evolves as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy difference between the two states .",
    "the second pulse creates a population difference between the two states which measures the relative phase accummulated by the atoms as compared to the phase accummulated by the external field during the period @xmath32 .",
    "the population difference is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in a condensate ,",
    "the population difference after the second pulse will be affected by two - body interactions which cause a phase diffusion of the relative phase of the two components in the interval @xmath29 between the pulses . as such , the population difference will experience collapse and revivals as function of @xmath29 . the collapse and revival times depend on the strength of the two - body interactions and the intial state of the condensate such that the collapse and revival times for a coherent state are different from a number state .",
    "wright _ et al .",
    "_ predicted a similar effect for the interference fringe visibility of two spatially overlapping condensates @xcite .",
    "they showed that the revival time for the fringe visibility for condensates initially in coherent states was twice that of condensates in number states .",
    "however , their result was based on the assumption that the intra - condensate interactions were the same and that inter - condensate interactions could be ignored .",
    "they also assumed that the coherence between the two number state condensates was established by measurement of the interference pattern in the same manner as described in @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the ramsey fringe technique is that the collapse and revivals manifest themselves in the population difference between the two condensate components which is readily measured used absorptive or dispersive imaging of the condensate .",
    "proposals to directly measure the order parameter , in order to detect collapse and revivals , such as @xcite usually rely on the detection of scattered light from the condensate .",
    "reference @xcite involves two independent condensates that are in spatially separated potentials",
    ". such an experiment would be technically difficult .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the second quantized hamiltonian for a two - component condensate and derive a two - mode model for the ground states of the two components .",
    "the two - mode hamiltonian is then represented in terms of angular momentum operators by exploiting the equivalence between the algebra of two harmonic oscillators and the angular momentum algebra . in section iii",
    ", we consider a condensate prepared in one of the modes with a state vector given by either a number state or a coherent state and study the time evolution of these states subject to two @xmath27 pulses . in section iv and v ,",
    "we discuss the collapse and revivals as well as relevant time scales for observing them .",
    "we consider a collection of bosonic atoms that have internal states @xmath35 and @xmath36 with energies @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "there is a spatially uniform time dependent radiation field with frequency @xmath28 which couples the two internal states with a rabi frequency @xmath39 .",

    "? there is in fact a difference since the quantum fluctuations of the coherent state are present in each experimental run whereas the statistical fluctuations of the number states only become manifest after averaging over many such runs . as an example , consider the case of the anti - revivals for the number state , @xmath254 , which can occur when @xmath255 in this case , one might observe such anti - revivals in any _ single _ experiment with a number state but such anti - revivals would never be observed in any experiment for a coherent state since it is the averaging over the poisson number distribution which prevents the anti - revivals .",
    "even though the anti - revivals may be observed in each experimental run for the number states , the average over many experimental runs , @xmath256 , will not exhibit the anti - revivals since they get averaged out .",
    "one may also consider initial states of the condensate given by @xmath257 where @xmath258 is sharply peaked around @xmath259 ( such as @xmath260 ) .",
    "this state satisfies eq .",
    "( [ sbgs ] ) for finite @xmath261 however , @xmath262 will exhibit qualitatively similar behavior to the coherent state @xcite since the critical difference in the results of the ramsey fringe experiment lie in the quantum fluctuations in the particle number of the coherent state .",
    "finally , we estimate the order of magnitude of the collapse and revival times . the fundamental time scale which determines the collapses and revivals",
    "is @xmath263 ( where we now explicitly include that factors of @xmath264 ) .",
    "if the trapping potentials for the two components are the same , @xmath265 then , @xmath266 and @xmath267 $ ] where @xmath268 if we assume a relatively weak trap , @xmath269 and if we take @xmath270 with @xmath271 as an estimate for @xmath26 , one finds @xmath272 = 0.023s^{-1}.$ ] therefore the collapse times will be on the order of @xmath273 for @xmath274 and the revival times will be on the order of @xmath275 note that since the scattering lengths are nearly equal for the two hyperfine states of the @xmath26 condensate @xcite , @xmath276 for @xmath277 however , this may be overcome by either manipulating one of the scattering lengths using a feshbach resonance@xcite or by changing the trapping potentials so that @xmath278 .    as mentioned , a ramsey fringe experiment has been performed at jila @xcite .",
    "however , this experiment was performed with a relatively large condensate ( @xmath279 ) such that @xmath280 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the experiment @xcite @xcite was based on the gross - pitaevskii equation which is a mean - field equation for the order parameter and , as such , already assumes a state of broken symmetry in the condensate .",
    "in addition , the duration of this experiment ( i.e. the period between pulses , @xmath29 ) was too short too observe the phase diffusion due to the quantum dynamics of the condensate ( see footnote [ 23 ] in ref .",
    "in this paper we have shown that ramsey s separated oscillatory field technique applied to a small atomic bose - einstein condensate exhibits collapse and revivals in the population difference between the two internal states of the condensate .",
    "the collapse and revival times depend on the strength of the two - body interactions and the initial state of the condensate so that one may potentially distinguish between a condensate state that is a number state or a coherent state .",
    "since absorptive and dispersive imaging of atomic bec measure the density of atoms in the condensate , the ramsey fringe experiment proposed here should be easier to perform than an experiment which tries to directly observe the collapse and revivals in the order parameter .",
