    "quantum system restricted on a bounded domain has become more relevant for theoretical physics . there , the role of boundary conditions are very important not only for the long distance ( infrared ) regime but also for the short distance ( ultraviolet ) regime .",
    "mathematically , the correct framework to treat the boundary conditions in quantum theory is by means of the analysis of von neumann s self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian operator @xcite . physically speaking",
    ", the variety of boundary conditions provided by the self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian implies that the very rich structure of point interactions available in quantum theory .",
    "the analysis of self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian , as the name suggests , is essentially based on the hamiltonian operator approach .",
    "however , in the feynman s path - integral approach , we do not know _ a priori _ how to incorporate the boundary conditions into the integration measure nor into the path - integral weight . as discussed in many textbooks",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , the naive path - integral representation for a system on a bounded domain leads to a wrong boundary behavior and hence requires modification .",
    "the most rigorous way to incorporate the boundary conditions into the feynman kernel is to evaluate it by the operator formalism .",
    "however , the kernel evaluated by the operator formalism becomes the summation over the energy spectrum . in order to switch to the path - integral description",
    ", we have to perform resummation of the energy spectrum to the paths of the space . in general",
    ", this resummation is accomplished by _",
    "trace formulae_. trace formulae provide a direct connection between quantum energy spectrum and classical length spectrum ( periodic orbits ) . however , this connection is in general an asymptotic relation valid for large wave numbers , just as in the case of the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite .",
    "there are only few cases where the trace formulae become identities .",
    "noteworthy among these are the poisson summation formula and the selberg trace formula @xcite , the former is the trace formula for the laplace operator on flat tori and the latter on riemannian manifolds with constant negative curvature .",
    "although in the operator formalism point interactions have been extensively discussed in the literature , the path - integral description of point interactions has not been fully understood yet . in mathematically speaking ,",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of trace formulae suitable for the point interactions . in physically speaking , on the other hand ,",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of our knowledge about the classical trajectories for a particle in the presence of point interactions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fulfill a gap of the description for boundary conditions between the operator formalism and the path - integral formalism : we would like to propose a physically transparent prescription how to incorporate the boundary conditions obtained in the operator formalism into the path - integral description .",
    "to illustrate our idea in a simple setting , in this paper we will consider a one - particle quantum mechanics on a circle in the presence of a single point interaction .    to begin with ,",
    "let us first consider a quantum particle on a circle of circumference @xmath1 in the presence of a @xmath2-interaction described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dimensionless coupling constant and prime ( @xmath5 ) indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "( here as in the following we are using units where @xmath7 . ) it is known that the @xmath2-interaction belongs to the so - called scale - independent subfamily of point interactions @xcite and is verified by the boundary conditions @xmath8\\psi(0)$ ] and @xmath9\\psi^{\\prime}(0)$ ] @xcite , where @xmath10 is the square integrable wave function on an interval @xmath11 . although the feynman kernel of this system has been analyzed in the literature @xcite , the physical interpretation for the weight factors ( see below ) remains open .",
    "we would like to first address this issue .",
    "as ubiquitous in the scale - independent point interactions , in this @xmath2-interaction case the wave numbers are quantized in an integer step so that it is easy to rewrite the feynman kernel @xmath12 evaluated in the operator formalism into the path - integral representation with the help of the poisson summation formula .",
    "the resultant kernel takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14<\\pi$ ] and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) sign for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xmath19 is the principal value of the inverse cosine .",
    "notice that the presence of a point interaction breaks the global translational invariance . as a consequence",
    "the kernel is the sum of partial amplitudes for the translational invariant and variant classes of trajectories , which are weighted by the factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .    before going to discuss the physical meaning of the weight factors",
    ", we have to reveal the particle propagations described by . to this end",
    ", it should first be noted that @xmath22 leads to @xmath23 so that eq . becomes the well - known form of the one - particle feynman kernel on a circle with periodic boundary conditions . as discussed in many textbooks",
    "( see for example ref.@xcite ) , in this @xmath22 case the kernel is the sum of partial amplitudes for transitions via classical paths distinguished by the homotopy class of @xmath24 , i.e. , the winding number . for nonzero @xmath25 , however , the classical trajectories of a particle are not so trivial due to the presence of @xmath2-potential , which acts as a point scatterer .",
    "when a particle reaches to the position of the point scatterer , there must be in general two possibilities : reflection or transmission .",
    "thus the paths for a particle interacting @xmath0-times to the point interaction must consist of @xmath26 distinct paths . as an example the classical world lines for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in are depicted in figure [ fig : world_lines ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we emphasize that the eigenvalues of the s - matrix depend only on the three parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whereas the eigenvectors depend on the full parameters of @xmath32 .",
    "the reason will be explained as follows : since the eigenvalues of the s - matrix on @xmath33 correspond to the energy spectrum of @xmath34 , we here explain why the energy spectrum of @xmath34 does not depend on @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we first point out that the parity operator @xmath37 is well - defined on @xmath34 .",
    "let us then consider the following ( singular ) unitary transformation :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 which acts on the two - component vectors as follows :    @xmath40    since the unitary transformation leaves the hamiltonian invariant , the energy spectrum remains the same but the boundary condition is changed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 thus , we found that the unitary transformation has an effect on @xmath43 by a rotation of the angle @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 this implies that the energy spectrum should depend on not @xmath43 but their invariant @xmath46 , which is identical to @xmath47 .",
    "thus the spectrum depends only on the three parameters @xmath48 .",
    "the main success of this work is the systematic description for a one - particle feynman kernel on a circle with a point interaction .",
    "the point is that we do not need any knowledge of the spectrum nor the complete set of energy eigenfunctions of the system ( except for the bound states ) .",
    "what we have to know is the classical trajectories of a particle and the one - particle scattering matrix .",
    "we are left with a number of questions , however .",
    "let us close with a few comments on these issues :    1 .",
    "_ more rigorous foundation of partial amplitude unitarity_. + we showed that the particle propagation scattered @xmath0-times from the point interaction should be weighted by the elements of @xmath49 .",
    "as a direct consequence of the unitarity of the s - matrix , these weight factors satisfies the relation @xmath50 , which we proposed to call _ partial amplitude unitarity_. as briefly discussed in section [ sec : examples ] , in the case of reflectionless subfamily of point interactions our partial amplitude unitarity and the laidlaw - dewitt theorem seem to be the same thing .",
    "however , the theorem is essentially based on the homotopy theory so that it could not be applied in general to the other subfamily of point interactions .",
    "we thought that the partial amplitude unitarity would provide a wider notion than the laidraw - dewitt theorem and should be derived from some fundamental properties of the feynman kernel such as the unitarity @xmath51 .",
    "+ another related issue is an algebraic structure for the construction of classical trajectories for a particle on @xmath34 . as mentioned before , the classical trajectories for a particle interacting @xmath0-times to the point interaction consist of @xmath26 distinct paths .",
    "these trajectories are constructed from the more fundamental trajectories depicted in figure [ fig : s - matrix ] by gluing them under the multiplication rule of the matrix @xmath52 .",
    "this fact implies that , in spite of the presence of a point singularity , it might be possible to introduce some kind of notion analogous to the fundamental group to the space @xmath34 .",
    "however , we have no idea to treat these problems",
    "path - integral representation for the kernels_. + the feynman kernels derived in this paper have the forms which will be obtained after performing the path - integration .",
    "it is very interesting to investigate its path - integral representation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , boundary conditions are treated unambiguously in operator formalism by von neumann s theory of self - adjoint extension . however , in path - integral formalism we do not know _ a priori _ what kind of trajectories we should integrate over and what kind of `` classical action '' we should adopt as a weight . indeed , even in the system of a free particle in an",
    "infinitely deep well potential , the `` classical action '' we should adopt as a path - integral weight includes the so - called _ topological term _ that localizes at the boundaries @xcite . furthermore , this topological term is proportional to the planck constant so that it is no longer classical . +",
    "to that aim we have to consider the limit @xmath53 of the equation : @xmath54      \\langle x|\\mathrm{e}^{-ih\\delta t}|x_{n-1}\\rangle      \\cdots      \\langle x_{1}|\\mathrm{e}^{-ih\\delta t}|x_{0}\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 .",
    "we already know the exact form of each partial amplitude @xmath56 . in order to evaluate the right hand side we have to tackle with the @xmath57 products of both translational invariant and variant classes of infinite sums .",
    "we would like to report this issue elsewhere .",
