    "as ultra - luminous explosions from the death of massive stars , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can , in principle , occur and be detected from redshifts at the epoch of reionization , serving as unique probes of the gas and metal - enrichment history in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at such redshifts beyond @xmath9 , the dynamics of the universal expansion",
    "is not yet dominated by the cosmological constant @xmath10 , so the construction of an early - universe hubble diagram using grbs would complement cosmography results found in the @xmath10-dominated regime at lower redshifts . since @xmath0-rays penetrate dust , a standard candle derived from grb energetics could avoid potential systematic errors inherent in supernovae ( sne ) due to uncertainties in dust extinction .",
    "cosmological @xmath11-corrections for grbs @xcite are , in principle , more tractable than traditional optical @xmath12-corrections for sne ; where grb spectra are devoid of emission / absorption features at @xmath0-ray wavelengths , sne spectra  due to the variety of filter bands used and uncertainty in the intrinsic spectral shape  are generally considered to contribute a redshift - dependent systematic error to sne ia magnitudes @xcite .",
    "still , both samples necessarily contend with unknown evolution of the standard candle ; but , owing to very different physics in the emission mechanisms , any such evolution would unlikely be the same for grbs and sne ia .",
    "early attempts to meaningfully constrain cosmological parameters using grb energetics were stymied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by what is now known @xcite as a wide distribution  more than 3 orders - of - magnitude  in the intrinsic isotropic - equivalent energies ( @xmath13 ) and luminosities of grbs .",
    "the realization that grbs are a jetted phenomena @xcite led to the discovery that the geometry - corrected prompt energy release ( @xmath1 ) in grbs appears nearly constant ( @xmath1410@xmath15erg @xmath16 foe ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this , along with the possibility of inferring grb redshifts from the @xmath0-ray properties alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , renewed enthusiasm for the cosmographic utility of grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite had noted this apparent constancy for what was then the current sample of 17 grbs with known redshifts . @xcite , with an expanded sample of 29 grbs with known @xmath5 , later argued that even geometry - corrected energetics were not sufficient for cosmography on both conceptual and empirical grounds .",
    "first , while the physical motivation for a standard energy release is plausible , the geometry correction of @xmath13 is highly model dependent , requiring an inference of the nature of the circumburst environment and assumptions about the structure of the jet .",
    "this problem persists even with new energy corrections detailed herein .",
    "second , the cosmographic utility of @xmath1 was limited by the presence of several low energy and high energy outliers , comprising upwards of 20% of the sample , spanning three orders of magnitude ( grb 980425 aside ) .",
    "@xcite argued that without an energy - independent discriminant ( such as properties of the afterglow ) such outliers could not be excluded ( or re - calibrated ) _ a priori _ when constructing a grb hubble diagram .",
    "a regularization of @xmath1 would require a universal relation between @xmath1 and other observables .",
    "the recent discovery of a connection between @xmath1 and the peak energy ( @xmath2 ) in the rest - frame prompt burst spectrum @xcite is apparently such a universal relation spanning the hardest , brightest bursts to the softest , faintest x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we demonstrate that this @xmath1@xmath2 ( `` ghirlanda '' ) relation can serve as an approximate empirical correction to grb energies , advancing grb energetics towards a more standardized candle . in presenting the formalism for correcting grb energetics ,",
    "we draw a strong analogy between our corrections and the empirical light - curve shape corrections ( based upon the peak brightness  decline rate correlation ) used to standardize the peak magnitudes of type ia sne @xcite . in   [ sec : cor ] we confirm the @xmath2@xmath1 relation and show that although the goodness of fit to the simple power - law relation is highly sensitive to input assumptions , the correlation itself is still highly significant over a variety of plausible cosmologies . in   [ sec : standard ] we introduce a new formalism , with an explicit accounting for observational uncertainties , for correcting grb energies . in   [ sec : compare ] we discuss similar work from @xcite and @xcite , noting critical differences in our respective methodologies and datasets .",

    "all errors on the cosmological @xmath11-correction are computed via the formalism in @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the rms scatter actually is an overestimate of the true 1-@xmath62 error on the median since the distribution is only approximately gaussian with a broad tail extending to low energies : as recognized by a number of authors , the low redshift burst grb 030329 ( @xmath63 ) , as well as grb 990712 , grb 021211 , and xrf 030429 all appear to be under - energetic by around 1 order of magnitude .",
    "moreover the low redshift grb 031203 ( @xmath64 ) along with xrfs 030723 ( @xmath65 ) and 020903 ( @xmath66 ) also appear under - luminous by at least @xmath67@xmath68 orders - of - magnitude  even assuming an isotropic explosion  as the geometry correction is not known for these bursts .",
    "@xcite recognized that these under - luminous bursts appeared systematically softer in the prompt burst spectrum than bursts of apparent higher @xmath1 . expanding upon the much discussed correlation @xcite between the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath13 and the restframe peak energy in the grb spectrum ( @xmath2 ) , the authors discovered a remarkably strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which can be represented as a power - law :",
    "@xmath69 the scaling @xmath70 is a constant which we choose in order to minimize the covariance between @xmath71 and @xmath72 when fitting for this two - parameter relation , simplifying future error analyses .",
    "this choice of @xmath70 does not affect the values of the best fit slope @xmath71 ( or the goodness of fit ) and the parameter @xmath72 simply scales as @xmath73 .",
    "using an updated set including 19 bursts with redshifts , @xmath74 , and reported @xmath27 measurements without upper / lower limits ( hereafter `` set a '' ) , we confirm the strong correlation in the standard cosmology for the set of assumptions detailed in   [ sec : cor ] , finding the best fit values of @xmath75 0.669 @xmath76 0.034 , @xmath77 252 @xmath76 11 kev ( @xmath78 erg ) , with a spearman @xmath79 correlation coefficient of 0.86 ( null hypothesis probability of @xmath80 ) .",

    "although the correlation is clearly significant , we find a reduced @xmath81dof = 3.71 ( for 17 degrees of freedom ; dof ) , suggesting that a single power - law does not adequately accommodate the data , given the assumptions and dataset compilation : we will address the dependence of @xmath82dof on various assumptions in detail in   [ sec : prev ] ,   [ sec : outliers ] .    despite the poor fit",
    ", @xcite correctly noted that this power - law fit is better than the fit to the @xmath2@xmath13 `` amati '' relation @xmath83 ( @xmath84 erg ) .",
    "indeed , for the subset of 29 bursts with measurements of redshift @xmath5 , and @xmath85 without upper / lower limits ( excluding grb 980425 ) , we find best fit @xmath86 , @xmath87 kev and a spearman @xmath79 correlation coefficient of @xmath88 , with a null hypothesis probability of no correlation of @xmath89 .",
    "as originally recognized by @xcite , the correlation is clearly significant .",
    "however the goodness of fit found here : @xmath90 ( 27 dof ) , is clearly poorer than for the new ghirlanda relation , and can not easily be improved by changing input assumptions .",
    "recent work @xcite , indicates that a significant fraction of grbs without known redshifts can not fall on the amati relation , which  due to selection effects  may be better understood as a demarcation of an upper limit ( where burst energies can be no greater than their isotropic equivalents ) .",
    "this implies that any intrinsic spectra - energy connection is more closely related to the ghirlanda relation than the amati relation ; this is not surprising given the more physically motivated , beaming - corrected energy , rather than the poor approximation of energy inferred for a spherical explosion .",
    "however , see @xcite for a similar analysis of the ghirlanda relation which raises the possibility that the relation itself could arise due to selection effects  mostly concerning the measurement of @xmath27 , @xmath48 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath1 relation has been fit in several other works @xcite using different data sets and a range of input assumptions different from those assumed herein .",
    "we focus on comparing our results with the sample of @xcite and @xcite : 15 bursts , hereafter `` set g '' , which uses a more complete sample than that of @xcite : 12 bursts , hereafter `` set d '' .",

    "the parameterization of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation and the reported errors on the slope that we find ; @xmath93 , @xmath94 = 3.71 ( 17 dof ) , are consistent with those given in @xcite and @xcite ; @xmath95 , @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "both fits are performed in the standard ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.7 ) , cosmology , but differ somewhat owing to the slightly larger sample used here to construct the fit ( 19 vs.  15 bursts ) , data selection differences for the bursts common to both samples ( again , see appendix  [ sec : data_selection ] ) , differing assumptions for the density and its fractional error , as well as the different energy bandpass used for @xmath1 .",

    "thus , as also stressed by @xcite , what may evolve from this work is a combination of grbs and sne ia , where sne ia are primarily useful for determining @xmath97 and @xmath8 at low @xmath5 , and grbs serve to provide independent , and potentially more accurate , constraints on @xmath6 ( without many low-@xmath5 bursts , grbs alone are essentially insensitive to @xmath97 ) .",
    "grbs could ultimately serve as an independent cross check to the systematic errors that would plague a sne ia sample with relatively sparse coverage in the @xmath242 region , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "this is in addition to the orthogonality of grbs to the systematic errors that are potentially the most problematic for sne ia , e.g. , dust , @xmath12-corrections , and evolution .",
    "granting that grbs are cosmographically useful in principle , we can test this in practice for the current sample , noting of course that the sample is small ( 19 bursts ) , depends on the typically unknown external density , and is not well sampled at low redshift . since the theoretical distance modulus @xmath245 and apparent grb distance modulus @xmath166 are functions which have complex , but different , dependences on the cosmological parameters @xmath246 , and @xmath97 , a minimization of the scatter in the residuals @xmath247 ( in the small angle jet limit ) can in principle be a useful tool to probe the geometry of the universe .",
    "we first stress the need to re - calibrate the slope of the relation for different cosmologies . to quantify this , although @xmath71 changes by no more than @xmath1425% across the full grid , this variation , as well as the error in determining the slope for each cosmology ( @xmath145% ) must be self - consistently taken into account in the fit to the grb hubble diagram .",
    "even changes of @xmath248 in @xmath71 ( and thus , @xmath72 and @xmath70 , since @xmath249 and @xmath71 are the two fundamental parameters in the fit ) affect the apparent grb luminosity distance sensitively as @xmath250 in the small angle limit ( eq .

    "equivalently , the cosmology can be parameterized in terms of ( @xmath6,@xmath8 ) , as in @xcite , but the sample requires a substantial fraction of low-@xmath5 bursts ( which our sample is lacking ) for optimal sensitivity to @xmath8 .",
    "again , note that there is no need to marginalize over @xmath70 ( implicit in the the zero point @xmath192 for @xmath166 ; eq .",
    "[ eq : dm_gamma ] ) because the parameters @xmath249 and @xmath71 are fit directly from the data for each cosmology .",
    "similarly , there is no need to marginalize over the hubble constant because its effect cancels in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2 ] ; the @xmath259 implicit each term of the numerator cancels and the denominator ( a log space error ) is a fractional error in real space , which is independent of @xmath98 .    although the method is , in principle , sound , the current data provide essentially _ no meaningful constraints _ on the cosmological parameters because the shape and normalization of the @xmath258 surfaces is highly sensitive to input assumptions and data references for individual bursts ( which are outliers to the ghirlanda relation for some input data and not for others ) . under our assumptions , the data do not give a good fit for the hubble diagram in _ any _ cosmology in our grid [ @xmath260,@xmath151 , with a minimum @xmath261 for the ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 ) = ( @xmath262 , @xmath263 ) cosmology ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "however , an interesting  but somewhat anticlimactic  feature emerges .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , for our set a , the peculiar , grb - favored loitering cosmology ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 ) = ( @xmath262 , @xmath263 ) remains essentially invariant over a range of input assumptions for density and its error .",
    "although not shown herein , we have confirmed that this strange attractor - like behavior ( at the surface minimum ) remains for our data set g ( less so for set d ) , although the shape and minimum @xmath94 of the surface do change sensitively due to small number statistics .",
    "this is not surprising , as @xcite find a similar best fit cosmology , ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 ) = ( @xmath265 , @xmath266 ) , for their data set g@xmath92 , although this point is overshadowed as they present their fit jointly with sne ia data ( see   [ sec : compare ] ) . extending upon the work of @xcite , @xcite",
    "also note the appearance of `` mathematically undesirable attractors '' near the loitering region , claiming that they are mathematical artifacts which can be removed with a new bayesian approach .",
    "the @xcite method does not use the traditional goodness of fit from a @xmath258 analysis , and although it probably deserves further study , it is unclear if it is warranted given the data and sensitivity to input assumptions . at least for our data and assumptions , the best fit parameters and errors",
    "are only meaningful if the fit is implicitly good , which is not the case for all density assumptions with fractional errors @xmath267 ( the value assumed in @xcite ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "thus , on statistical grounds , we are not entitled to believe the best fit loitering cosmology currently favored by grbs , relieving us of the burden of explaining a cosmology inconsistent with flatness which comes close to seriously challenging the big bang model .",
    "all told , the results herein indicate that , when considering the full data set for a range of input assumptions , grbs are simply not yet useful for cosmography .",
    "since there are a host of potential uncertainties in this nascent approach to grb cosmography , at present , we focus on constraining @xmath6 and @xmath97 using grbs _ alone_. while @xcite and @xcite have attempted to constrain @xmath8 , the former with grbs alone , and the latter using a combined fit with sne ia , we consider this well - motivated but likely premature , due both to the presence of many unaddressed and potentially problematic systematic errors ( which we attempt to address in   [ sec : sys ] ) , along with the aforementioned sensitivity to input assumptions , data set , and the relatively small grb sample compared to sne ia .",
    "@xcite have made use of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation to form a more standard candle and test cosmological models .",
    "they report remarkably tight constraints on @xmath268 ( 68.3% confidence assuming flatness ) . yet",
    ", there are a number of reasons why we believe this work has significantly overstated the cosmographic power of grbs .",
    "first , the @xcite sample contains 7 fewer bursts ( 12 vs.  19 ; @xmath269 50% ) than our sample . as seen in table",
    "[ table2 ] and graphically in figure  [ fig1 ] , two of the absent bursts ( grbs 990510 and 030226 ) are the two most extreme outliers in @xmath136 .",
    "grb 990510 remains an outlier independent of density assumptions as it has a density constraint @xcite , while grb 030226 is an outlier under either set of assumptions , worsening for the @xcite density assumption relative to ours .",
    "@xcite do offer some justification to exclude these two bursts , but clearly these exclusions  which we feel are unwarranted  help to significantly tighten the scatter and improve the cosmology statistics .",
    "second , the authors did not perform the fit of the ghirlanda relation self - consistently but instead assumed the slope of the relation to be fixed for all cosmologies .",
    "the value @xmath126 derived in @xcite assumes a ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) = ( 0.27 , 0.73 , 0.71 ) cosmology .",
    "the authors treat their fit as a rough confirmation of the @xmath95 slope found in @xcite for a slightly different ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.7 ) cosmology , and fix @xmath270 , thereafter , neglecting the derived uncertainty .",
    "@xcite do attempt to justify this and note `` this power to be insensitive to @xmath6 '' for their data set .",
    "however , as we have shown , while the particular value of the slope does not vary dramatically , even for a wide range of cosmologies , one can not ignore even this small cosmology dependence in the context of self - consistent cosmography . by fixing @xmath270 ,",
    "the @xcite analysis ignores the fact that the value of @xmath71 is not known _ a priori _ , but instead is a simple empirical ( bad ) fit to noisy data .",
    "@xcite also express similar concerns in their discussion of the @xcite analysis .    as with @xcite and @xcite",
    ", @xcite assumed a density ( @xmath271 @xmath55 ) which improves the fit relative to our assumption of @xmath272 @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite also assume the small angle approximation , which , as mentioned , is accurate for @xmath1 , @xmath165 , and @xmath45 , but _ overestimates _ the error in @xmath165 , which can be derived analytically ( see   [ sec : error ] ) .",
    "alone , overestimating the errors @xmath181 improves the fit to the grb hubble diagram .",
    "however , this is compensated for in eq .  5 of @xcite relative to our eq .",
    "[ eq : dl_gamma_err ] , since they assume a smaller error on the density ( @xmath273 v.s .",
    "@xmath274 ) , and their eq .  5 neglects the error terms we include involving @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the @xmath11-correction .",
    "these competing effects lead us to derive similar typical errors on the distance modulus , where we find @xmath275 mag , vs. @xmath276 mag in @xcite . however , it is hard to perform a direct comparison since the authors do not report a goodness of fit for their favored cosmology , whereas we find a minimum @xmath82dof @xmath277 , ( 17 dof ) for the grb hubble diagram under our assumptions for our set a. furthermore , @xcite  present constraints on the equation of state parameter @xmath8 given priors on flatness and @xmath6 , which is an interesting potential application of grb cosmology , but may be premature given the small dataset , the large dependence upon the outliers , and the strong sensitivity to input assumptions .",
    "@xcite have taken a number of steps to improve upon the dai et al .",
    "they have rightfully acknowledged that the @xmath2@xmath1 correlation should be re - calibrated for each cosmology and should include the uncertainty in the slope @xmath71 when performing a cosmographic analysis .",
    "they too , independent of our work , have noted that grbs alone are insensitive to the measurement of @xmath97 ( we specifically note that this insensitivity is directly attributable to the lack of low - redshift bursts , although @xcite do suggest the need for more lower-@xmath5 bursts ) .",
    "the @xcite analysis does not include 4 bursts ( these bursts actually slightly _ improve _ the goodness of fit of the relation to a power law ) .",
    "@xcite also avoid using the small angle approximation to calculate @xmath1 in practice , although they do not present the equations for the error analysis explicitly .",
    "both our fit to the @xmath2@xmath1 relation and the @xcite fit  with @xmath163 ( 17 dof ) and @xmath107 ( 13 dof ) , respectively  follow from our different input assumptions and data selection choices .",
    "this highlights the extreme sensitivity to the input assumptions ( especially density ) , uncovered here when trying to reconcile the differences between our respective works .",
    "our original disagreements stemmed from the difficulty involved in interpreting the cosmographic method of analysis in @xcite , which , in contrast to @xcite , is presented in words but not explicitly formulated in equations . as mentioned , from @xcite alone , it is not clear that when they `` allow @xmath28 to cover the full [ 1 - 10 ] @xmath55 range '' , this means @xmath113",
    "@xmath55 @xmath278 @xmath55 ( roughly 125% error ) , which is required to reproduce @xmath107 for the fit to the @xmath2@xmath1 relation from their data .",
    "this turns out to be crucial , because without this extra information , it is not possible to compare or even reproduce their results for the @xmath2@xmath1 relation from @xcite and @xcite alone .",
    "ultimately , however , investigation of this elucidated the sensitivity to density .    rather than focusing on the cosmology selected by grbs alone , the authors report a joint fit with sne ia . by including a set of 15 grbs ( with large errors ) along with 156 ( better constrained ) sne ia data points ( the `` gold '' sample of @xcite ) ,",
    "it is clear that the joint fit presented in @xcite is dominated by the supernovae , which already are consistent with today s favored cosmology concordance model derived from cmb data @xcite , and large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that sne ia themselves are only marginally consistent with _",
    "wmap _ , whereas the combined sne ia + grb fit results in contours that are more consistent with a flat , @xmath10dominated universe . however , this line of reasoning ignores the fact that grbs alone are strikingly _ inconsistent _ with _ wmap _ or flatness , where the best fit found in @xcite straddles the cosmic loitering line , which borders the region in the @xmath6@xmath97 plane for which there is _ no big bang _ ( although see @xcite ) . while it is certainly reasonable to assume flatness as a prior and explore the outcome , we feel it is important to stress the cosmographic potential of grbs alone , and first determine whether grb cosmography is robust and comparable to cosmography with sne ia before attempting to combine them .",
    "ultimately , the sensitivity to input assumptions and data selection we have found here makes it currently inappropriate to use grbs for cosmography , let alone combine with other better understood standard candles .",
    "here , we briefly identify some major potential systematic errors concerning grb cosmography . the list is not meant to be comprehensive , but to serve as the starting point for future work .",
    "we do not discuss possible selection effects on the sample ( e.g. , malquist bias ) , but see @xcite which considers selection effects in testing the consistency of a large sample of _ batse _ bursts with the ghirlanda relation , extending upon similar work for the amati relation @xcite .",
    "although @xcite conclude that as many as @xmath279 of the bursts in their sample may not be consistent with the ghirlanda relation , this depends sensitively on the assumed distribution for @xmath42 . under the least model - dependent assumption which only requires @xmath280 for all bursts ( e.g. , @xmath281 ) , @xcite estimate that only 1.6% of their sample is inconsistent with the ghirlanda relation . in any case , the @xcite analysis raises the possibility that the ghirlanda relation itself may merely reflect observational selection effects , which , if true , would fundamentally undermine any cosmographic use of the relation .      the choice of rest frame bolometric bandpass for the cosmological @xmath11-correction @xcite @xmath282 $ ] is implicit in the definition of , and any interpretation of , @xmath1 ( eq .

    "however , as shown in earlier error analysis , even assuming maximal covariance  which we argue is unlikely  leads to at most a factor of @xmath299 underestimate of the errors in @xmath1 , @xmath136 , or @xmath165 , respectively .",

    "@xcite also argue that , despite both being derived from broad band afterglow modeling , @xmath27 and @xmath28 should have small covariance , because @xmath117 is usually determined from early optical / ir afterglow data whereas @xmath28  in the rare cases where it is estimated  is best constrained by late time radio data ( see their footnote 6 ) .",
    "@xcite also argue that the possible covariance between @xmath25 and @xmath11 is small , introducing at most a factor of @xmath142 uncertainty into the error on @xmath11 ( see their  2.1 ) .",

    "gravitational lensing is not likely to dominate the systematics , though higher redshift bursts are more likely to be lensed than lower redshift sne ia .",
    "@xcite has argued , based on beaming , that the probability of detection for a high - redshift grb is largely unaffected by malquist bias ( but see also @xcite ) ; so the principal concern is whether the inferred values of @xmath1 will be systematically skewed for bursts at higher redshift .",

    "weak lensing , with a broad probability of amplification between 0.8 and 1.2 , is expected at @xmath308 in a @xmath10cdm model @xcite but , since there is roughly an equal probability of amplification and de - amplification , weak lensing biases are systematically suppressed with a larger sample size .      if grb progenitors are massive wolf - rayet type stars as in the popular collapsar model @xcite or the hypernova model @xcite , one naturally expects at least some bursts to go off in the presence of a wind - blown environment ( wind ) where the radial density profile varies as the inverse square of the radial distance @xcite .",
    "following equation ( 31 ) of @xcite , a wind modifies our equation  [ eq : theta_jet ] for the jet opening angle , and in general , @xmath1 will be smaller when inferred for the wind case for the same value of @xmath27 and typical density scalings ( e.g. , @xmath309=1 , defined in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the context of the fit to the ghirlanda relation , a wind will help an outlier burst to fall on the relation only if @xmath1 , calculated assuming an ism , was too large ( i.e. , the data point has excess energy on the x - axis in figure  [ fig1 ] relative to the best fit line ) . of the bursts that are outliers in this sense ( 970508 , 011211 , 020124 , and 020813  with 011121 and 010921 as lower and upper limit outliers respectively ) , only for 011121",

    "more detailed analysis would require marginalizing over , or sampling statistically from , the assumed density distribution ( e.g. , a monte carlo simulation ) , which is beyond the scope of this work .      as with density , assuming the _ same _ efficiency for all bursts represents a potential systematic error , although , as discussed , it is likely to be a much weaker effect .",
    "following , @xcite , we assume a @xmath0ray production efficiency of @xmath39 ( 20% ) for all bursts in our sample . in the context of the internal shock model ,",
    "this is consistent with the range of theoretically predicted efficiencies : @xmath319 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 has been reported for individual bursts for the @xmath99 $ ] kev bandpass , as determined with radio fireball calorimetry , x - ray modeling of the afterglow kinetic energy , or other estimates of the total energy of the fireball @xcite .",
    "estimates for individual bursts range from @xmath143% ( 970508 : @xcite ) , to as high as @xmath1488% ( 991208 : @xcite ) .",
    "although the various techniques used to estimate @xmath29 are highly uncertain , clearly the assumption of a constant efficiency for each burst is suspect . in light of the uncertainty involved , it may be appropriate to at least assume some error on @xmath29 , for example a 50100% error , in future work .",
    "as with density , a potential future approach involves assuming a distribution ( e.g. , a gaussian ) , and marginalizing over it , or sampling from it statistically .",
    "we have shown that , given our set of assumptions , the fit to the ghirlanda relation remains poor in the standard cosmology ( @xmath320 ) , across the entire grid of cosmologies , and for all data subsets that we consider . as was the case for the standard cosmology , @xmath94 can only be made acceptable at the minimum of these surfaces by changing the input assumptions or by choosing different parameter references for individual bursts .",
    "although this casts doubt on the current cosmographic utility of the relation , it must be stressed that it is _ possible _ to obtain good fits simply by changing the density ( and/or efficiency )  to otherwise reasonable values  for bursts without reliable constraints .",
    "the value of @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 ) might be determined _ a priori _ from * i ) * a well motivated theoretical model or * ii ) * by measuring a sample of grbs at low redshift , where the observed grb properties are essentially independent of the cosmology @xcite .",
    "this low-@xmath5 population would represent a `` training set '' , analogous to the training set of low-@xmath5 sne ia used to calibrate the various light curve shape corrections to type ia sne magnitudes in a cosmology independent way . with grbs , at present , we do not have the luxury of such low redshift calibration , so the best one can do is use the _ data itself _ as the training set , and calibrate the relation separately for each cosmology . as also realized by @xcite ( in contrast to @xcite ) , this is currently the only self - consistent way to do cosmology with grbs .",
    "procuring such a training set may be feasible in practice .",
    "in the current sample of @xmath321 bursts with known redshifts ( table  [ table1 ] ) , grbs 980425 , 030329 , and 031203 have @xmath322 . with a similar detection ratio , _ swift _ may find @xmath323@xmath324 such low-@xmath5 bursts / year , and with its higher sensitivity , possibly an even greater number if the intrinsic population has been underestimated .",
    "this would conservatively provide a reasonable training set of @xmath325@xmath120 objects within only 2 years .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that only 1 burst _ in our sample thus far _",
    "( grb 030329 , @xmath5=0.1685 ) falls into this potential training set class . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , 030329 is remarkable because it it highly discrepant from the mean in energy , yet falls extremely close to the best fit line for the @xmath2@xmath1 relation . as a single burst",
    ", it is the low redshift anchor of the relation and comes as close as possible to acting as a cosmology independent calibrator .",
    "however , one needs more than a single point to constrain a slope , and although more low-@xmath5 bursts are expected with _",
    "swift _ , it remains to be seen whether they will _ actually fall on the relation_. in fact , as mentioned , the two lowest redshift grbs ( 980425 and 031203 ) are the two _ most striking outliers _ to the relation regardless of any assumptions about the value of the ambient density . rather than a failure of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation , such outliers might serve as a diagnostics for identifying different progenitor classes , going beyond the recognition of purely sub - energetic bursts , which are now quite common .",
    "in fact , with the relatively recent discoveries of grbs 030329 and 031203 and xrfs 020903 and 030723 , the existence of true outliers in the @xmath1 distribution became incontrovertible ; grb980425 is not simply a singular anomaly in prompt - burst energy release . without compelling reason to exclude these outlier bursts on energy - independent grounds , what was once a promising prospect , the @xmath1 distribution ( e.g. , @xmath207 ) , is clearly a poor standard candle .",
    "even if there exists a standard reservoir of energy in grb explosions , on conceptual grounds , it is entirely plausible that @xmath1 should differ from burst to burst , sensitive to the variation in @xmath0ray efficiency .",
    "the energy channeled into gravitational - radiation , neutrinos , and the supernova explosion are also likely offer significant contributions to the total energy budget .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that the kinetic energy ( @xmath326 ) in relativistic ejecta ( as proxied by the radio and x - ray afterglow ) may be comparable ( if not greater ) than the @xmath1 .",
    "of course , this hypothesis , in concert with the ghirlanda power - law , implies a trivial connection of @xmath326 upon @xmath71 and @xmath2 : @xmath327 , with @xmath328 foe @xmath329 erg @xcite . in this context , although in their fit to grbs with x - ray afterglow @xcite do not find a constant @xmath330 , it is curious to note that those authors do find that @xmath331 , a power - law consistent with @xmath332 .",
    "perhaps more interesting , if @xmath330 is indeed constant then the efficiency of shock conversion to @xmath0-rays , @xmath29 , should be @xmath333 ( as opposed to @xmath334 found by @xcite ) , suggesting xrfs are lower - efficiency shocks , rather than off - axis grbs . if there are multiple jet components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the value of @xmath29 is even less than implied by the relation .",
    "also , such a connection between @xmath29 and @xmath2 would imply that the inference of @xmath21 inheres an implicit dependence upon @xmath2 , requiring a reformulation of @xmath1 and thus the ghirlanda relation .",
    "inherent in the reconstruction of @xmath1 is also a systematic uncertainty in the jet structure and diversity of the bursts .",
    "we have cast the correction formalism in the context of the top - hat model , where the energy per solid angle remains constant across the cone of the jet , independent of the observer s viewing angle relative to the central beaming axis . if instead , all grbs jets are universal with the energy per steradian falling as the square of the azimuthal angle @xcite , or a gaussian profile @xcite , a similar _ spread _ of the resultant @xmath1 distributions is inferred . in such alternative jet prescriptions , we have confirmed that @xmath1 still correlates with @xmath2 and so we argue that the need to specify a particular jet model is _ obviated _ : all that is required is the existence of an empirical correlation between @xmath85 and some function of observables , which may happen to be interpreted as @xmath1 in some particular jet model .",
    "although the ghirlanda relation has been interpreted in the context of a top hat jet model , it is ultimately derived empirically from observables .",
    "although there is still some uncertainty surrounding the physical basis for the sn ia light curve peak luminosity - decline rate correlations @xcite , the basic mechanism involving sensitivity to @xmath335ni production is fairly well understood @xcite . in contrast , the physics that gives rise to the intrinsic correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is not well - understood ( although see  @xcite and  @xcite with the latter concerning the related @xmath2@xmath13 correlation ) . while the choice of jet model is irrelevant if one is interested only in an empirical correlation , it is _ highly relevant _ if one is seeking a meaningful physical explanation . in particular",
    ", understanding @xmath1 _ alone _ requires a more physical jet model than a simple top hat , as @xmath1 has a clear physical interpretation as the total beaming - corrected @xmath0ray energy , which is computed differently between jet models .",
    "indeed , a structured jet , with more energy on axis , finds natural support in numerical simulations of the `` collapsar model '' @xcite . at the very least ,",
    "physical jets are likely to have an energy profile much more complicated that some simple analytic function  for example , a highly variable jet core with `` wings '' @xcite .",
    "if future @xmath336 data provide better support for a single power law , for example , the slope @xmath71 may contain information about the underlying physics , and might be useful in actually _ constraining _ jet models , as the intrinsic value of @xmath1 ( and probably @xmath2 ) clearly depend on the jet structure of the burst . the physical origin of @xmath2 itself is even less understood ( although , again , see @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , as stressed by @xcite , the relation clearly has great promise to lend insight into grb radiation mechanisms , and is likely more fundamental that the long discussed @xmath2@xmath13 relation @xcite . as discussed , a theoretical _ cosmologically - independent _ explanation for the relation would help reduce the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath136 , the @xmath209 correction term for each burst , and @xmath166 by effectively reducing @xmath251 ( @xmath252 ) to nil ( this , too , has been noted by @xcite ) .",
    "however , better understanding of the underlying density distribution is required in either case .",
    "regardless of the physical basis for the ghirlanda relation , we have shown that the @xmath209 correction provides a significant improvement to the standard candle .",
    "further improvements to the @xmath209 corrections should be possible with more detailed observations : more early - time measurements of grb afterglows should help constrain the density of the circumburst medium , along with its radial dependence ( which may arise from a stellar wind ; @xcite ) , testing our assumption of a constant - density medium .",
    "in addition , the value of the conversion efficiency to gamma - rays ( @xmath29 ) may not be constant and may indeed be a measurable quantity for each burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "even with incomplete density ( efficiency ) data , a more detailed analysis can be completed in future work by assuming probability distributions for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and marginalizing over them , and/or sampling from them in a statistical ( monte carlo ) fashion .",
    "the existence of a relationship between @xmath1 and another intrinsic property of the grb mechanism also augers well for the potential refinement of the standard energy with additional relations .",
    "for example , correlations between @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 and grb temporal profiles ( e.g. , variability ) @xcite and/or spectral evolution ( e.g. , spectral lags ) @xcite might prove useful in reducing the scatter of the dimensionless grb standard candle @xmath131 .",
    "that is , the ghirlanda relation may prove to be a projection from a higher - dimension `` fundamental plane '' involving additional observables .    if , with an expanded dataset and additional refinements to @xmath209 , grbs prove to be standardizable candles , tests of cosmological models could be performed to redshifts @xmath337 or higher @xcite , a lever arm where hubble diagrams diverge most which could help pin down * i ) * the matter density to higher precision , * ii ) * the redshift of the transition to the epoch of deceleration , and * iii ) * systematics of the dark energy and its time variation @xcite , complementary to type ia sne @xcite .",
    "such redshifts are higher than type ia supernovae could ever reach ( @xmath236 ) , even in the best of all possible type ia detection scenarios ( _ jwst _ notwithstanding ) , with a sample essentially free of reddening / extinction by dust , and with potentially less systematically biased @xmath11-corrections , several years before the expected launch of the _ snap _ satellite @xcite .",
    "ultimately , if the dark energy shows exotic time variation , ultra high redshift cosmology ( e.g. , @xmath240 ) may prove quite interesting , lending insight into much more than the matter density",
    ".    also of great interest , an expanded set ( with better constrained densities ) will allow for tests of the evolution of the grb standard candle @xmath131 with redshift  clearly a crucial insight if high - redshift bursts are to be used for cosmography . with the current sample ,",
    "no evolution in the corrected energies is apparent , from redshifts of 0.1 to 4.5 , a difference in look back time that is @xmath1480% the age of the universe ( see fig  [ fig3 ] ) , although , of course , this depends on density assumptions for individual bursts which could conceivably be tuned to mimic evolution .",
    "even so , any systematic evolutionary effects ( which must occur at some limiting redshift when the grb progenitors become population iii stars ; @xcite ) are bound to be different than those for type ia supernovae , providing a complementary , independent check .",
    "while indeed more promising than @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) or the @xmath2@xmath13 relation ( which can be used to construct a corrected standard candle roughly intermediate in accuracy between @xmath207 and @xmath136 since the amati relation is implicit in the ghirlanda relation ) , in strong contrast to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , we have found this new grb standard candle @xmath136 provides essentially no meaningful constraints on @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the current , small sample of less than 20 events , most notably due to the sensitivity to data selection choices and assumptions for the unknown density ( efficiency ) .    still , despite the current uncertainties and rather strong dependence on input assumptions and data selection , we believe the standardization of grb energetics holds promise , thanks to the discovery of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation .",
    "sne ia data and , by extension , grb data probe an orthogonal region in the parameter space . whereas cmb power spectrum measurements are sensitive most to @xmath338 , @xmath339 , and @xmath340 , sne ia measurements , and hence grb measurements are sensitive essentially to the difference @xmath341 , with grbs being most sensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "aside from providing more bursts for statistics , with accurate and homogeneously - determined grb and afterglow parameters , we expect that the _ swift _ satellite will yield further refinements towards a standardizable grb energy .    to that end",
    ", we stress the importance of early - time broad band ground based follow up observations to help constrain the ambient density ( efficiency ) of future bursts ( also of independent interest for constraining the progenitors ) .",
    "we also highlight the continued relevance of the _ hete ii _ satellite ( with its 30 - 400 kev bandpass ) concerning _ all _ applications of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation , as the spectral coverage of the bat detector on _ swift _ is limited largely to the narrow 15 - 150 kev range @xcite . as such , the current work strengthens the science case for the ongoing symbiosis of _ hete ii _ and _",
    "swift_. by further exploring the @xmath2@xmath1 relation in this manner , we may potentially lend insight towards both our understanding of grbs and to the expansion history of the universe .",
    "* addendum : * recent work @xcite extends upon the work of @xcite , while @xcite extends upon the work of @xcite . the new work ,",

    "peak energy measurements are occasionally inconsistent from different satellites ( e.g. ,  grb 970508 ) , and in these cases , we choose the bursts that have spectra which are well described by the band model and we preferentially choose @xmath48 measurements with reported error bars .",

    "these values are also representative of those found for a large sample of bright _ batse _ bursts @xcite .",
    "thus , in the absence of constraints , we set @xmath52 ( choosing @xmath352 would not affect the analysis ) and @xmath53 where appropriate ( the latter is also assumed in @xcite , and similar averages are used in @xcite ) .",
    "occasionally , measurements of fluence @xmath25 from different satellites are inconsistent , but more often than not , we can not determine whether two independent measurements are inconsistent if either one or both do not report 1-@xmath62 error bars .",
    "as noted , in these cases , we use input fluence measurements with reported errors with priority over fluence measurements in wider bandpasses . for example , for pre-_hete ii _ bursts , we generally will choose a _ bepposax _ burst measured in the @xmath353 $ ] kev bandpass with reported fluence errors over a _ batse _",
    "bursts measured in the larger @xmath99 $ ] kev bandpass when the latter does not have reported fluence errors .    in the case of competing @xmath27 measurements",

    "as such , there is reason to consider a lower limit criteria for fractional errors of 10% on the jet - break time .",
    "although we do not modify the reported measurement errors for any bursts in this fashion , if we did , it would affect the following bursts : [ grb / xrf : @xmath27 [ days ] ; reference ] @xmath303 [ 011211 : @xmath354 ; @xcite ] , [ 990510 : @xmath355 ; @xcite , @xmath356 ; @xcite , @xmath357 ; @xcite ( we reference the latter ) ] , [ 021004 : @xmath358 ; @xcite ] , and [ 030329 : @xmath359 ; @xcite ] .",

    "density measurements require detailed broad band afterglow modeling ( see @xcite ) , and are generally unknown for most bursts , requiring us to assume a value .",
    "of the 52 bursts listed in table  [ table1 ] , only 12 have reliable density estimates which are listed here .",
    "however , at least an additional 11 bursts have densities reported in the literature : [ grb / xrf : @xmath28 [ @xmath55 ] ; reference ] @xmath303 [ 980519 : @xmath364 ; @xcite ] , [ 990123 : @xmath365 , @xmath366 ; @xcite , 000911 : @xmath265 ; @xcite ] , [ 020124 : @xmath314 ; @xcite ] , [ 020405 : @xmath367 , @xcite ] , [ 020427 : @xmath314 ; @xcite ] , [ 020903 : @xmath313 ; @xcite ] , [ 021211 : @xmath368 , @xmath369 ; @xcite ] , [ 030226 : @xmath313 ; @xcite ] , [ 030723 : @xmath314 ; @xcite ] , and [ 040924 : @xmath370 ; @xcite ] , but we do not list them in table  [ table1 ] because either * i ) * the densities are from estimates other than broadband afterglow modeling , * ii ) * the estimate assumed a redshift ( e.g. , 980519 , @xmath371 assumed in @xcite ) , * iii ) * the estimates had been contradicted by further analyses of the same data ( e.g. , 990123 ; @xcite ) , or * iv ) * the densities are unreliable for some other reason , such as being distinctly presented as tentative by the authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> the use of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) energetics for cosmography has long been advanced as a means to probe out to high redshifts , to the epoch of deceleration . however , though relatively immune to systematic biases from dust extinction , the prompt energy release in grbs , even when corrected for jetting geometry , is far from being a standard candle . in this work , </S>",

    "<S> we present an explicit , self - consistent formalism for correcting grb energies with a thorough accounting for observational uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other work , we demonstrate that the current sample of 19 grbs is not yet cosmographically competitive to results from type ia supernovae , large - scale structure , and the microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath2@xmath1 relation is a highly significant correlation across a range of cosmologies [ @xmath3 , the goodness of fit of the data to a power law ( @xmath4 ) , depends strongly on input assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the most important of these assumptions concern the unknown density ( and density profile ) of the circumburst medium , the efficiency of converting explosion energy to @xmath0rays , data selection choices for individual bursts ( some of which were not included in similar work ) , and assumptions in the error analysis . </S>",
    "<S> independent of assumptions , with very few low-@xmath5 bursts , the current sample is most sensitive to @xmath6 but essentially _ insensitive _ to @xmath7 ( let alone the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proper use of the relation clearly brings grbs an impressive step closer toward a standardizable candle , but until the physical origin of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation is understood , calibrated with a training set of low redshift ( e.g. , cosmology independent ) bursts , and the major potential systematic uncertainties and selection effects are addressed , we urge caution concerning claims of the utility of grbs for cosmography . </S>"
