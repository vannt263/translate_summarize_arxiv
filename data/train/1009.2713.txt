    "consider three identical bosons ( or fermions with spin and isospin ) that occupy a spatially symmetric @xmath0-state .",
    "efimov predicted in 1970 that the spectrum obeys a geometrical scaling law , such that the ratio of the successive energy eigenvalues of the system is a constant.@xcite this scaling results in an accumulation of states near zero energy , with the size of the system growing larger by a factor of about @xmath1 for identical bosons for every state approaching zero energy .",
    "the number of these three - body bound states is infinite when the dimer binding is zero .",
    "however , the number of three - body bound states is actually reduced as the two - body interaction is made more attractive .",
    "more remarkable is the fact that the efimov effect is independent of the details of the interaction , for example , whether it is between atoms with a pair - wise van der waals interaction , or between nuclei with a nuclear force .",
    "the effect persists even with unequal masses , as long as two of the three dimer bonds have near - zero binding .",
    "these statements will be made more precise in the following .",
    "a rigorous proof of efimov s prediction followed in 1972.@xcite recently , an analytical solution for three identical bosons exhibiting the efimov spectrum has been obtained.@xcite efimov examined the triton and @xmath2c ( the latter as a bound state of three alpha particles ) for manifestations of his prediction .",
    "however , for nuclear systems , the interaction between two nucleons can not be adjusted to yield a two - body zero - energy bound state .",
    "also , the coulomb potential between protons often restricts the examples for which two of the three participants are loosely bound neutrons@xcite in the field of a nuclear core .",

    "et al._@xcite with an optically trapped dilute gas of @xmath3cs atoms at 10nk . at such low temperatures ,",
    "thermal motion does not mask quantum effects .",
    "moreover , the two - body interaction between atoms may be fine - tuned using `` feshbach resonance.''@xcite under such conditions , the recombination losses increase sharply due to the formation of efimov trimers , giving the experimental signature of the effect .",

    "although there are excellent reviews of efimov physics ( see , for example , ref .  ) , beginning graduate or senior undergraduate students unfamiliar with the quantum three - body problem might find them inaccessible .",
    "the efimov effect arises from the large - distance ( asymptotic ) behavior of the inverse square interaction .",
    "the spectrum resulting from such a potential is well - known,@xcite and its implications for efimov physics are discussed in ref .  .",

    "the efimov effect is universal and does not depend on this special choice of a separable potential .",
    "a choice of the more familiar local form for the potential would entail more advanced aspects of the three - body problem , while not adding to the essential physics .",

    "if three or more particles are involved , the situation is not so simple , even when the particles interact only pair - wise .",
    "if a third particle is present near the pair , it might take away some energy in the scattering process .",
    "the two - body scattering amplitude is then said to be  off the energy shell , \" and depends on the short - distance behavior of the two - body wave function .    the exact description of the three - body problem is given by three coupled integral equations involving the two - body off - the - energy - shell scattering amplitudes.@xcite the efimov effect in the three - body problem is remarkable in the sense that its existence is dictated only by the low - energy two - body elastic scattering properties , and not by the off - shell behavior .",

    "iv , we avoid solving the faddeev equations explicitly , while still obtaining the efimov spectrum .    for two - body scattering at very low energies , the interaction is effective only in the relative @xmath0-state , because the centrifugal barrier in the higher partial waves suppresses the particles from coming close together .",

    "starting with the pioneering work of kraemer _ et al._@xcite with ultra - cold cs atoms in 2006 , several experiments@xcite have confirmed efimov s predictions by measuring the three - body recombination losses of atoms through the reaction @xmath173 .",
    "the experiment with heteronuclear atoms was done by barontini _",
    "et al._@xcite all these experiments require very low temperature @xmath174 for a very large scattering length @xmath11 to avoid break up of the dimers .",
    "for example , for cs atoms , @xmath175nk was required to largely eliminate thermal effects .",
    "the atoms in a gas have a tendency to form lower energy dimers directly for scattering length @xmath55 .",
    "but two atoms alone can not form a bound state and preserve momentum and energy at the same time .",
    "dimer formation is possible if a third atom is nearby within a distance of the order @xmath11 .",
    "this problem was studied in a gas of identical atoms with number density @xmath80 , while looking at atomic losses in bose - einstein condensates.@xcite let the number of three - body recombinations per unit volume per unit time be denoted by @xmath176 , which is proportional to @xmath177 . here",
    "@xmath178 is the probability of two atoms being in the interaction volume @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the elastic scattering cross section and @xmath181 is the relative speed between the two atoms .",

    "it has been calculated from theory.@xcite the recombination length ( the ordinate of fig.4 ) is defined as @xmath186 , where the numerical factor is included to take into account the reduced mass of the trimer , and the fact that three atoms are lost for each trimer .     adapted from fig .  2 of ref .  .",
    "the solid circles are experimental data points  @xcite at @xmath187 nk for the observed three - body recombination : @xmath188 .",
    "the scattering length is measured in units of the bohr radius @xmath189.,title=\"fig:\",width=514 ]    to understand the experimental peak in the measured recombination length @xmath190 ( see fig .  4 ) ,",
    "note that shallow dimers are not formed directly for @xmath191 .",
    "the potential @xmath88 of fig .  3 develops a potential barrier for large @xmath86 , followed by an attractive potential at shorter distances .",
    "such a potential emerges from a hyperspherical calculation for equal mass bosons.@xcite there may result , for certain negative values of @xmath11 , shape resonances of the trimer at @xmath58 .",
    "when the energy of the three atoms matches a resonance , there is enhanced barrier penetrability to form an efimov trimer .",
    "the enhanced barrier penetrability allows the system to relax to a deeply bound dimer state ( from the interatomic potential ) , with the excess energy being carried away by the third atom .",
    "the peak @xmath190 on the negative side is at @xmath192 , where @xmath189 is the bohr radius .",
    "the next peak should be at a value of @xmath11 that is @xmath1 times larger , that is , @xmath193 , which is outside the range of experimental observation .",
    "nevertheless , these multiple peaks were observed in later experiments.@xcite even though multiple resonance peaks were not seen in the kraemer _",
    "et al._@xcite experiment , the interference minimum observed on the positive @xmath11 side is convincing evidence for the efimov effect.@xcite hyperspherical calculations for @xmath55 not only give an attractive potential as in fig .  3 for @xmath88 , but also a barrier for positive energies that falls off for large @xmath86 .",
    "the three incoming atoms may be reflected by the barrier , and form @xmath194 on the way out , interfering with the incoming dimer plus atom system following the large-@xmath86 attractive channel of fig .",
    "the out - of - phase interference between the two paths leads to the curve that fits the experiment for positive @xmath11 ( see fig .  2 of ref .  ) .",
    "it is remarkable and not foreseeable in 1970 that the efimov effect has been experimentally verified using ultra - cold atoms .",
    "we have considered a simple case for which two of the atoms are very heavy compared to the third .",
    "the light heavy pairs are treated very differently , as evidenced by the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the light particle is almost unbound , and can be very distant from the heavy partners .",
    "the overall size of the shallow efimov trimer is large in comparison to the short - range of the two - body interaction .    as is clear from sec .",
    "iv , it is the dynamics of the light particle that generates the attractive long - range interaction between the heavy ones .",
    "we may regard the light particle as being exchanged back and forth to generate this potential between the two heavy particles .",
    "even for equal mass particles , efimov@xcite has stressed this intuitive picture for the inverse square potential .",
    "a different approach must be taken for three identical particles , as indicated briefly in sec .",
    "iii for three identical bosons .",
    "each particle has to be treated the same way , and hyperspherical coordinates are well - suited to describe the shallow efimov states .",
    "the size of these states is large , and the small binding results in the formation of floppy triangles . for these shallow states ,",
    "the coupling between the hyperradial variable @xmath86 and the hyperangles is small .",
    "the coupling vanishes for @xmath195 , and the hyperangular contribution just adds a centrifugal term for angular motion to the adiabatic potential @xmath196 . the deepest potential is attractive enough ( for @xmath197 ) to yield the efimov effect .    for three nucleons the overall wave function under the exchange of any two has to be antisymmetric . as was originally found by efimov ,  @xcite imposing these symmetries results in only the spatially symmetric angular momentum state @xmath197 ( with the spin - isospin combination antisymmetric ) leading to an attractive interaction . unlike charge neutral ultra - cold atoms",
    ", it is not possible to manipulate the strength of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .    given that there is suggestive experimental evidence for the efimov effect in the four - body sector ( see for example , ref .  ) , it is clear that efimov physics in ultra - cold atoms will continue to be an active area of research .",
    "one way to obtain the number of bound states of a potential is to calculate the canonical partition function @xmath198 , where @xmath199 for our purpose may be taken to be a positive parameter .",
    "the expression for @xmath200 may be written as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the density of states .",
