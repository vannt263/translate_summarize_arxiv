    "one of the most promising ways to detect the effects of new physics ( np ) on @xmath3 decays is to look for deviations of flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes from their standard model ( sm ) predictions ; fcnc processes only occur at the loop - level in the sm and hence are particularly sensitive to np virtual particles and interactions . a prominent example that has received extensive experimental and theoretical attention",
    "is @xmath15@xmath16 mixing ( @xmath17 ) , which , in the sm , is due to box diagrams with @xmath18-boson and up - type quark exchange . in the language of effective field theory , these diagrams induce an effective hamiltonian , which causes @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons to mix and generates a @xmath19 transition : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-meson mass .",

    "since the currently operating @xmath2 @xmath3 factories run at the @xmath28 resonance , which decays into @xmath29 , but not into @xmath8 mesons , the @xmath8 system can not be explored by the babar and belle experiments .",
    "however , plenty of @xmath8 mesons are produced at the tevatron ( and later on will be at the lhc ) , which  very recently  allowed the cdf collaboration to measure @xmath7 with the result given above @xcite ; the d0 collaboration has provided , also very recently , a two - sided bound on @xmath7 at the 90% c.l .",

    "it turns out that the situation in the @xmath8 system is more favourable than in the @xmath4 system , and that still ample space for np effects in @xmath5@xmath6 mixing is left , which could be detected at the lhc . in section  [ sec : np - models ] , we complement the model - independent discussion of sections  [ sec : bd ] and [ sec : bs ] by analyses of two specific scenarios for np : models with an extra @xmath9 boson and supersymmetry ( susy ) with an approximate alignment of quark and squark masses .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "before going into the details of @xmath15@xmath16 mixing and possible np effects , let us first have a closer look at the relevant input parameters and their uncertainties . throughout our analysis",
    ", we assume that the ckm matrix is unitary , and shall use this feature to express the ckm elements entering @xmath15@xmath16 mixing in terms of quantities that can be determined through tree - level processes of the sm . the key rle is then played by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "we will use both results in our analysis .    whereas any improvement of the error of @xmath54 will have only marginal impact on the analysis of @xmath3 mixing",
    ", a reduction of the uncertainty of @xmath55 will be very relevant . as a benchmark scenario for the situation in 2010",
    ", we will assume that the central value of @xmath63 gets confirmed and that its uncertainty will shrink to @xmath64 , i.e.  5% , thanks to better statistics and an increased precision of theoretical predictions , for instance from further developments in the dressed gluon exponentiation @xcite .",
    "the next ingredient in the sm prediction for @xmath66 are the non - perturbative matrix elements @xmath67 .",
    "these parameters have been the subject of numerous lattice calculations , both quenched and unquenched , using various lattice actions and implementations of both heavy and light quarks .",
    "the current front runners are unquenched calculations with 2 and 3 dynamical quarks , respectively , and wilson or staggered light quarks . despite tremendous progress in recent years , the results still suffer from a variety of uncertainties which is important to keep in mind when interpreting and using lattice results . one particular difficulty in determining @xmath68 is the chiral extrapolation needed to go to the physical @xmath69-quark mass.- and @xmath69-quark masses and use @xmath70 .",
    "the physical value of the light - quark mass ratio is then @xmath71 from chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "] lattice calculations are usually performed at unphysically large @xmath47- and @xmath69-quark masses , as the simulation of dynamical fermions involves many inversions of the fermions functional determinant in the path integral and is very dear in terms of cpu time .",
    "therefore , an extrapolation , called the chiral extrapolation , in the light - quark masses from feasible to physical masses is necessary , which is done using the functional form predicted by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "based on these arguments , the chiral extrapolation of @xmath72 to the physical limit is expected to be smooth , whereas that of @xmath68 is potentially prone to logarithms @xcite , which leads to a considerable increase in the uncertainty .",
    "the most recent ( unquenched ) simulation by the jlqcd collaboration @xcite , with non - relativistic @xmath73 quarks and two flavours of dynamical light ( wilson ) quarks , yields @xmath74gev and @xmath75 where the first error includes uncertainties from statistics and various systematics , whereas the second , asymmetric error comes from the chiral extrapolation .",
    "note that part of the systematic errors cancel in the ratio @xmath76 . in this calculation",
    ", the ratio @xmath77 was varied between 0.7 and 2.9 .",
    "more recently , ( unquenched ) simulations with three dynamical flavours have become possible using staggered quark actions .",
    "the hpqcd collaboration obtains @xmath78mev @xcite , where a ratio of @xmath77 as small as 0.125 could be achieved , due to the good chiral properties of the staggered action .",
    "this implies that the chiral extrapolation is less critical and the corresponding error much smaller . the quoted error on @xmath40",
    "is now dominated by yet uncalculated higher - order matching terms which are needed to match the ( effective theory ) lattice calculations to continuum qcd .",
    "lacking any direct calculation of @xmath39 with three dynamical flavours , and in view of the fact that the bag parameter is likely to be less sensitive to chiral extrapolation , it has been suggested to combine the results of @xmath40 from hpqcd with that of @xmath39 from jlqcd , yielding @xcite : @xmath79 where all errors are added in quadrature .",
    "although we shall use both ( [ jlqcd ] ) and ( [ hpqcd ] ) in our analysis , we would like to stress that the errors are likely to be optimistic .",
    "apart from the issue of the chiral extrapolation discussed above , there is also the question of discretisation effects ( jlqcd uses data obtained at only one lattice spacing ) and the renormalisation of matrix elements ( for lattice actions without chiral symmetry , the axial vector current is not conserved and @xmath40 needs to be renormalised ) , which some argue should be done in a non - perturbative way @xcite .",
    "simulations with staggered quarks also face potential problems with unitarity , locality and an odd number of flavours ( see , for instance , ref .",
    ". a confirmation of the hpqcd results by simulations using the ( theoretically better understood ) wilson action with small quark masses will certainly be highly welcome .",
    "given this situation , we consider it not very likely that the errors on @xmath40 , @xmath80 and @xmath76 will come down considerably in the near future . for our benchmark 2010 scenario , we hence will assume the values of hadronic parameters and uncertainties given in ( [ hpqcd ] ) .",
    "we are now well prepared for the discussion of @xmath15@xmath16 mixing .",
    "let us first have a closer look at the @xmath38@xmath81 mixing parameters . in the presence of np , the matrix element @xmath82 can be written , in a model - independent way , as @xmath83 where the real parameter @xmath84 measures the `` strength '' of the np contribution with respect to the sm , whereas @xmath85 is a new cp - violating phase",
