    "in this paper we present an alternative to the one of the standard axioms of quantum mechanics ; namely , that the hamiltonian @xmath2 , which incorporates the symmetries and specifies the dynamics of a quantum theory , must be hermitian : @xmath3 .",
    "it is commonly believed that the hamiltonian must be hermitian in order to ensure that the energy spectrum ( the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ) is real and that the time evolution of the theory is unitary ( probability is conserved in time ) .",
    "although this axiom is sufficient to guarantee these desired properties , we argue here that it is not necessary .",
    "we believe that the condition of hermiticity is a mathematical requirement whose physical basis is somewhat remote and obscure .",
    "we demonstrate here that there is a simpler and more physical alternative axiom , which we refer to as space - time reflection symmetry ( @xmath1 symmetry ) : @xmath4 .",
    "this symmetry allows for the possibility of non - hermitian and complex hamiltonians but still leads to a consistent theory of quantum mechanics .",
    "we also show that because @xmath1 symmetry is an alternative condition to hermiticity it is now possible to construct infinitely many new hamiltonians that would have been rejected in the past because they are not hermitian .",
    "an example of such a hamiltonian is @xmath5 .",
    "it should be emphasized that we do not regard the condition of hermiticity as wrong .",
    "rather , the condition of @xmath1 symmetry offers the possibility of studying new and interesting quantum theories .",
    "let us recall the properties of the space reflection ( parity ) operator @xmath6 and the time - reflection operator @xmath7 .",
    "the parity operator @xmath6 is _ linear _ and has the effect @xmath8 the time - reversal operator @xmath7 is antilinear and has the effect @xmath9 note that @xmath7 changes the sign of @xmath10 because , like the parity operator , it preserves the fundamental commutation relation of quantum mechanics , @xmath11 = i$ ] , known as the heisenberg algebra.=e_3 $ ] , @xmath12=[e_2,e_3]=0 $ ] . to recover the heisenberg commutation relations we set @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . ]",
    "it is easy to construct infinitely many hamiltonians that are not hermitian but do possess @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "for example , consider the one - parameter family of hamiltonians @xmath16 note that while @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) is not symmetric under @xmath17 or @xmath7 separately , it is invariant under their combined operation .",
    "we say that such hamiltonians possess space - time reflection symmetry .",
    "other examples of complex hamiltonians having @xmath1 symmetry are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and so on @xcite in ( [ e1 ] ) along the path @xmath20 has a different spectrum from the hamiltonian that is obtained by continuing @xmath21 along the path @xmath22 .",
    "this is because the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions are different . ] .    the class of @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians is larger than and includes real symmetric hermitians because any real symmetric hamiltonian is automatically @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "for example , consider the real symmetric hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "this hamiltonian is time - reversal symmetric , but according to the usual definition of space reflection for which @xmath24 , this hamiltonian appears not to have @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "however , recall that the parity operator is defined only up to unitary equivalence @xcite . in this example",
    ", if we express the hamiltonian in the form @xmath25 , then it is evident that @xmath2 is @xmath1 symmetric , provided that the parity operator performs a space reflection about the point @xmath26 rather than @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite for the general construction of the relevant parity operator .",
    "five years ago it was discovered that with properly defined boundary conditions the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) is _ real and positive _ when @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is partly real and partly complex when @xmath29 .",
    "the eigenvalues have been computed numerically to very high precision , and the real eigenvalues are plotted as functions of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "we say that the @xmath1 symmetry of a hamiltonian @xmath2 is _ unbroken _ if all of the eigenfunctions of @xmath2 are simultaneously eigenfunctions of @xmath1 .",
    "is symmetric under the discrete time - reversal symmetry @xmath31 .",
    "note that the solutions @xmath32 and @xmath33 do not exhibit this time - reversal symmetry while the solution @xmath34 is time - reversal symmetric .",
    "the same is true with a system whose hamiltonian is @xmath1 symmetric .",
    "even if the schrdinger equation and the corresponding boundary conditions are @xmath1 symmetric , the wave function that solves the schrdinger equation boundary value problem may not be symmetric under space - time reflection .",
    "when the solution exhibits @xmath1 symmetry , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "conversely , if the solution does not possess @xmath1 symmetry , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry is broken .",
    "] it is easy to show that if the @xmath1 symmetry of a hamiltonian @xmath2 is unbroken , then the spectrum of @xmath2 is real .",
    "the proof is short and goes as follows : assume that a hamiltonian @xmath2 possesses @xmath0 symmetry ( that is , that @xmath2 commutes with the @xmath1 operator ) , and that if @xmath35 is an eigenstate of @xmath2 with eigenvalue @xmath36 , then it is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath37 : @xmath38    we begin by showing that the eigenvalue @xmath37 is a pure phase . multiplying @xmath39 on the left by @xmath1 and using the fact that @xmath6 and @xmath7 commute and that @xmath40 we conclude that @xmath41 and thus @xmath42 for some real @xmath43 .",
    "next , we introduce the convention that is used throughout this paper . without loss of generality",
    "we replace the eigenstate @xmath35 by @xmath44 so that its eigenvalue under the operator @xmath1 is unity : @xmath45 let us turn to the eigenvalue equation @xmath46 .",
    "we multiply this equation on the left by @xmath1 and use the fact that @xmath47=0 $ ] to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "hence , @xmath49 and the eigenvalue @xmath36 is real .",
    "the crucial assumption in this argument is that @xmath35 is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in quantum mechanics",
    "if a linear operator @xmath50 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath2 , then the eigenstates of @xmath2 are also eigenstates of @xmath50 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the operator @xmath1 is not linear ( it is antilinear ) and thus we must make the extra assumption that the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath2 is unbroken ; that is , that @xmath35 is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this extra assumption is nontrivial because it is not easy to determine _ a priori _ whether the @xmath1 symmetry of a particular hamiltonian @xmath2 is broken or unbroken . for the hamiltonian @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] )",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken when @xmath28 and it is broken when @xmath29 .",
    "note that the conventional hermitian hamiltonian for the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator lies at the boundary of the unbroken and the broken regimes .",
    "recently , dorey _ et al .",
    "_ proved rigorously that the spectrum of @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) is real and positive @xcite in the region @xmath28 .",
    "many other @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians for which space - time reflection symmetry is not broken have been investigated , and the spectra of these hamiltonians have also been shown to be real and positive @xcite .    while it is useful to show that a given non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian operator has a positive real spectrum , the urgent question that must be answered is whether such a hamiltonian defines a physical theory of quantum mechanics . by a _ physical theory _ we mean that there is a hilbert space of state vectors and that this hilbert space has an inner product with a positive norm . in the theory of quantum mechanics",
    "we interpret the norm of a state as a probability and this probability must be positive .",
    "furthermore , we must show that the time evolution of the theory is unitary .",
    "this means that as a state vector evolves in time the probability does not leak away .",
    "it is not at all obvious whether a hamiltonian such as @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) gives rise to a consistent quantum theory . indeed , while past investigations of this hamiltonian have shown that the spectrum is entirely real and positive when @xmath28 , it appeared that one inevitably encountered the severe problem of dealing with hilbert spaces endowed with indefinite metrics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will identify a new symmetry that all @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians having an unbroken @xmath0-symmetry possess .",
    "we denote the operator representing this symmetry by @xmath51 because the properties of this operator resemble those of the charge conjugation operator in particle physics .",
    "this will allow us to introduce an inner product structure associated with @xmath52 conjugation for which the norms of quantum states are positive definite .",
    "we will see that @xmath52 symmetry is an alternative to the conventional hermiticity requirement ; it introduces the new concept of a _ dynamically determined _ inner product ( one that is defined by the hamiltonian itself ) . as a consequence",
    ", we will extend the hamiltonian and its eigenstates into the complex domain so that the associated eigenvalues are real and the underlying dynamics is unitary .",
    "we begin by summarizing the mathematical properties of the solution to the sturm - liouville differential equation eigenvalue problem @xmath53 associated with the hamiltonian @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the differential equation ( [ e4 ] ) must be imposed on an infinite contour in the complex-@xmath54 plane . for large @xmath55",
    "this contour lies in wedges that are placed symmetrically with respect to the imaginary-@xmath54 axis @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions are that @xmath56 exponentially rapidly as @xmath57 on the contour . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the contour may be taken to be the real axis .",
    "when @xmath28 , the hamiltonian has an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "thus , the eigenfunctions @xmath59 are simultaneously eigenstates of the @xmath1 operator : @xmath60 . as we argued above",
    ", @xmath61 is a pure phase and , without loss of generality , for each @xmath62 this phase can be absorbed into @xmath59 by a multiplicative rescaling so that the new eigenvalue is unity : @xmath63    there is strong evidence that , when properly normalized , the eigenfunctions @xmath59 are complete .",
    "the coordinate - space statement of completeness ( for real @xmath54 and @xmath64 ) reads @xmath65 this is a nontrivial result that has been verified numerically to extremely high accuracy ( twenty decimal places ) @xcite .",
    "note that there is a factor of @xmath66 in the sum .",
    "this unusual factor does not appear in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "the presence of this factor is explained in the following discussion of orthonormality [ see ( [ e8 ] ) ] .",
    "here is where we encounter the underlying problem associated with non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "there seems to be a natural choice for the inner product of two functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath69g(x ) , \\label{e7}\\ ] ] where @xmath70^*$ ] and the integral is taken over the contour described above in the complex-@xmath54 plane .",
    "the apparent advantage of this inner product is that the associated norm @xmath71 is independent of the overall phase of @xmath67 and is conserved in time .",
    "phase independence is desired because in the theory of quantum mechanics the objective is to construct a space of rays to represent quantum mechanical states . with respect to this inner product",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath72 and @xmath59 of @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) are orthogonal for @xmath73 . however ,",
    "when @xmath74 the norm is evidently _ not positive _",
    ": @xmath75 this result is apparently true for all values of @xmath30 in ( [ e4 ] ) and it has been verified numerically to extremely high precision . because the norms of the eigenfunctions alternate in sign ,",
    "the hilbert space metric associated with the @xmath1 inner product @xmath76 is indefinite .",
    "this split signature ( sign alternation ) is a _",
    "generic _ feature of the @xmath1 inner product .",
    "extensive numerical calculations verify that the formula in ( [ e8 ] ) holds for all @xmath28 .    despite the lack of positivity of the inner product ,",
    "we proceed with the usual analysis that one would perform for any sturm - liouville problem of the form @xmath77 .",
    "first , we use the inner product formula ( [ e8 ] ) to verify that ( [ e6 ] ) is the representation of the unity operator .",
    "that is , we verify that @xmath78 second , we reconstruct the parity operator @xmath6 in terms of the eigenstates . the parity operator in position space is @xmath79 , so from ( [ e6 ] ) we get @xmath80 by virtue of ( [ e8 ] ) the square of the parity operator is unity : @xmath81 .",
    "third , we reconstruct the hamiltonian @xmath2 in coordinate space : @xmath82 using ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) it is easy to see that this hamiltonian satisfies @xmath83 .",
    "fourth , we construct the coordinate - space green s function @xmath84 : @xmath85 note that the green s function is the functional inverse of the hamiltonian ; that is , @xmath86 satisfies the equation @xmath87g(x , z)= \\delta(x - z ) .",

    "the technique is to consider the case @xmath89 so that we may treat @xmath54 as real and then to decompose the @xmath54 axis into two regions , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we can solve the differential equation in each of these regions in terms of bessel functions .",

    "the apparent difficulty with formulating a quantum theory is that the vector space of quantum states is spanned by energy eigenstates , of which half have norm @xmath95 and half have norm @xmath96 .",
    "because the norm of the states carries a probabilistic interpretation in standard quantum theory , the existence of an indefinite metric in ( [ e8 ] ) seems to be a serious obstacle .",
    "the situation here in which half of the energy eigenstates have positive norm and half have negative norm is analogous to the problem that dirac encountered in formulating the spinor wave equation in relativistic quantum theory @xcite .",
    "following dirac s approach , we attack the problem of an indefinite norm by finding a physical interpretation for the negative norm states .",
    "we claim that in _ any _ theory having an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry there exists a symmetry of the hamiltonian connected with the fact that there are equal numbers of positive - norm and negative - norm states .",
    "to describe this symmetry we construct a linear operator denoted by @xmath51 and represented in position space as a sum over the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath97    as stated earlier , the properties of this new operator @xmath51 are nearly identical to those of the charge conjugation operator in quantum field theory . for example , we can use equations ( [ e6 ] ) - ( [ e8 ] ) to verify that the square of @xmath51 is unity ( @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath51 are @xmath100 . also , @xmath51 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath51 is linear , the eigenstates of @xmath2 have definite values of @xmath51 . specifically ,",
    "if the energy eigenstates satisfy ( [ e8 ] ) , then we have @xmath101 because @xmath102 we then use @xmath103 according to our convention .",
    "we conclude that @xmath51 is the operator observable that represents the measurement of the signature of the @xmath0 norm of a state .",

    "path independence is a consequence of cauchy s theorem and the analyticity of the integrand . in conventional quantum mechanics , where the positive - definite inner product has the form @xmath116 , the integral",

    "we choose the integration contour for the inner product ( [ e8 ] ) so that it does not cross the positive imaginary axis .",

    "we find it surprising that a positive - definite metric can be constructed using @xmath52 conjugation without disturbing the path independence of the inner - product integral .",
    "finally , we explain why @xmath1-symmetric theories are unitary .",
    "time evolution is determined by the operator @xmath117 , whether the theory is expressed in terms of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian or just an ordinary hermitian hamiltonian . to establish the global unitarity of a theory",

    "real_. however , at the edge of the bands the wave function of a particle in such a lattice is always bosonic ( @xmath172-periodic ) and , unlike the case of ordinary crystal lattices , the wave function is never fermionic ( @xmath173-periodic ) @xcite .",
    "direct observation of such a band structure would give unambiguous evidence of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "there are many opportunities for the use of non - hermitian hamiltonians in the study of quantum field theory .",
    "for example , a scalar quantum field theory with a cubic self - interaction described by the lagrangian @xmath174 is physically unacceptable because the energy spectrum is not bounded below .",
    "however , the cubic scalar quantum field theory that corresponds to @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath175 is given by the lagrangian density @xmath176 .",
    "this is a new , physically acceptable quantum field theory .",
    "moreover , the theory that corresponds to @xmath2 in ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath177 is described by the lagrangian density @xmath178 what is remarkable about this `` wrong - sign '' field theory is that , in addition to the energy spectrum being real and positive , the one - point green s function ( the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath179 ) is _ nonzero _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the field theory is renormalizable , and in four dimensions is asymptotically free ( and thus nontrivial ) @xcite .",
    "based on these features of the theory , we believe that the theory may provide a useful setting to describe the dynamics of the higgs sector in the standard model .    other field theory models",
    "whose hamiltonians are non - hermitian and @xmath1-symmetric have also been studied . for example , @xmath0-symmetric electrodynamics is particularly interesting because it is asymptotically free ( unlike ordinary electrodynamics ) and because the direction of the casimir force is the negative of that in ordinary electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this theory is remarkable because it can determine its own coupling constant .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theories have also been studied @xcite .",
    "we have found that @xmath1-symmetric quantum theories exhibit surprising and new phenomena .",
    "for example , when @xmath180 is sufficiently small , the @xmath181 theory described by the lagrangian ( [ e28 ] ) possesses bound states ( the conventional @xmath182 theory does not because the potential is repulsive ) .",
    "the bound states occur for all dimensions @xmath183 @xcite , but for purposes of illustration we describe the bound states in the context of one - dimensional quantum field theory ( quantum mechanics ) .",

    "we define @xmath192\\qquad(\\nu\\to0^+ ) .",
    "\\label{e31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath193 , then a two - particle bound state exists and the ( negative ) binding energy is @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath195 , then the second excitation above the vacuum is interpreted as an unbound two - particle state .",
    "we see from ( [ e31 ] ) that in the small - coupling region , where perturbation theory is valid , the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a bound state . indeed , using wkb , variational methods , or numerical calculations",
    ", one can show that there is no two - particle bound state for any value of @xmath196 . because there is no bound state the @xmath197 interaction",
    "may be considered to represent a repulsive force .",
    "needed to create two particles at a given time is more than twice the energy @xmath189 needed to create one particle . ]",
    "we obtain the perturbation series for the non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath198 from the perturbation series for the conventional anharmonic oscillator by replacing @xmath199 with @xmath200 .",
    "thus , while the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a two - particle bound state , the @xmath1-symmetric oscillator does indeed possess such a state .",
    "we measure the binding energy of this state in units of the renormalized mass @xmath189 and we define the _ dimensionless _ binding energy @xmath201 by @xmath202 this bound state disappears when @xmath199 increases beyond @xmath203 . as @xmath199 continues to increase , @xmath201 reaches a maximum value of @xmath204 at @xmath205 and then approaches the limiting value @xmath206 as @xmath207 .    in the @xmath1-symmetric anharmonic oscillator , there are not only two - particle bound states for small coupling constant but also @xmath185-particle bound states for all @xmath208 .",
    "the dimensionless binding energies are @xmath209 the key feature of this equation is that the coefficient of @xmath199 is negative .",
    "since the dimensionless binding energy becomes negative as @xmath199 increases from @xmath210 , there is a @xmath185-particle bound state .",
    "the higher multiparticle bound states cease to be bound for smaller values of @xmath199 ; starting with the three - particle bound state , the binding energy of these states becomes positive as @xmath199 increases past @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 .",
    "thus , for any value of @xmath199 there are always a finite number of bound states and an infinite number of unbound states .",
    "the number of bound states decreases with increasing @xmath199 until there are no bound states at all .",
    "there is a range of @xmath199 for which there are only two- and three - particle bound states .",
    "this situation is analogous to the physical world in which one observes only states of two and three bound quarks . in this range of @xmath199",
    "if one has an initial state containing a number of particles ( renormalized masses ) , these particles will clump together into bound states , releasing energy in the process . depending on the value of @xmath199",
    ", the final state will consist either of two- or of three - particle bound states , whichever is energetically favored .",
    "note also that there is a special value of @xmath199 for which two- and three - particle bound states can exist in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "how does a @xmath215 theory compare with a @xmath182 theory ?",
    "a @xmath216 theory has an attractive force .",
    "the bound states that arise as a consequence of this force can be found by using the bethe - salpeter equation . however , the @xmath217 field theory is unacceptable because the spectrum is not bounded below .",
    "if we replace @xmath180 by @xmath218 , the spectrum becomes real and positive , but now the force becomes repulsive and there are no bound states .",
    "the same is true for a two - scalar theory with interaction of the form @xmath219 .",
    "this latter theory is an acceptable model of scalar electrodynamics , but has no analog of positronium .",
    "another feature of @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theory that distinguishes it from the conventional quantum field theory lies in the commutation relation between the @xmath6 and @xmath51 operators .",
    "specifically , if we write @xmath220 , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are real , then @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "these commutation and anticommutation relations suggest the possibility of interpreting @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theory as describing both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , an idea analogous to the supersymmetric quantum theories .",
    "the distinction here , however , is that the supersymmetry can be broken ; that is , bosonic and fermionic counterparts can have different masses without breaking the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "therefore , another possible observable experimental consequence might be the breaking of the supersymmetry .",
    "we have argued in this paper that there is an alternative to the axiom of standard quantum mechanics that the hamiltonian must be hermitian .",
    "we have shown that the axiom of hermiticity may be replaced by the more physical condition of @xmath1 ( space - time reflection ) symmetry .",
    "space - time reflection symmetry is distinct from the condition of hermiticity , so it is possible to consider new kinds of quantum theories , such as quantum field theories whose self - interaction potentials are @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "such theories have previously been thought to be mathematically and physically unacceptable because the spectrum might not be real and because the time evolution might not be unitary .",
    "these new kinds of theories can be thought of as extensions of ordinary quantum mechanics into the complex plane ; that is , continuations of real symmetric hamiltonians to complex hamiltonians .",
    "the idea of analytically continuing a hamiltonian was first discussed in 1952 by dyson , who argued heuristically that perturbation theory for quantum electrodynamics is divergent @xcite .",
    "dyson s argument involves rotating the electric charge @xmath227 into the complex plane @xmath228 .",
    "applied to the quantum anharmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is given in ( [ e29 ] ) , dyson s argument would go as follows : if the coupling constant @xmath180 is continued in the complex-@xmath180 plane to @xmath229 , then the potential is no longer bounded below , so the resulting theory has no ground state .",
    "thus , the ground - state energy @xmath230 has an abrupt transition at @xmath231 .",
    "if we represent @xmath230 as a series in powers of @xmath180 , this series must have a zero radius of convergence because @xmath230 has a singularity at @xmath231 in the complex - coupling - constant plane .",
    "hence , the perturbation series must diverge for all @xmath232 . while the perturbation series does indeed diverge , this heuristic argument is flawed because the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) that is obtained remains ambiguous until the boundary conditions that the wave functions must satisfy are specified .",
    "the spectrum depends crucially on how this hamiltonian with a negative coupling constant is obtained .",
    "there are two ways to obtain the hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) .",
    "first , one can substitute @xmath233 into the hamiltonian ( [ e29 ] ) and rotate from @xmath165 to @xmath234 . under this rotation",
    ", the ground - state energy @xmath230 becomes complex .",
    "evidently , @xmath230 is real and positive when @xmath196 and complex when @xmath235 . to @xmath236",
    ", we obtain the same hamiltonian as in ( [ e32 ] ) but the spectrum is the complex conjugate of the spectrum obtained when we rotate from @xmath165 to @xmath237 . ]",
    "second , one can obtain ( [ e32 ] ) as a limit of the hamiltonian @xmath238 as @xmath239 .",
    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian is real , positive , and discrete .",
    "the spectrum of the limiting hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) obtained in this manner is similar in structure to that of the hamiltonian in ( [ e29 ] ) .",
    "how can the hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) possess two such astonishingly different spectra ?",
    "the answer lies in the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave functions @xmath59 . in the first case , in which @xmath240 is rotated in the complex-@xmath180 plane from @xmath210 to @xmath241",
    ", @xmath242 vanishes in the complex-@xmath54 plane as @xmath57 inside the wedges @xmath243 and @xmath244 . in the second case , in which the exponent @xmath30 ranges from @xmath210 to @xmath245",
    ", @xmath59 vanishes in the complex-@xmath54 plane as @xmath57 inside the wedges @xmath243 and @xmath246 . in this second case",
    "the boundary conditions hold in wedges that are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis ; these boundary conditions enforce the @xmath247 symmetry of @xmath2 and are responsible for the reality of the energy spectrum .",
    "apart from the spectra , there is another striking difference between the two theories corresponding to @xmath2 in ( [ e32 ] ) .",
    "the one - point green s function @xmath248 is defined as the expectation value of the operator @xmath54 in the ground - state wave function @xmath249 , @xmath250 where @xmath251 is a contour that lies in the asymptotic wedges described above .",
    "the value of @xmath248 for @xmath2 in ( [ e32 ] ) depends on the limiting process by which we obtain @xmath2 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath252 into the hamiltonian ( [ e29 ] ) and rotate from @xmath165 to @xmath234 , we find by an elementary symmetry argument that @xmath253 for all @xmath180 on the semicircle in the complex-@xmath180 plane .",
    "thus , this rotation in the complex-@xmath180 plane preserves parity symmetry ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , if we define @xmath2 in ( [ e32 ] ) by using the hamiltonian in ( [ e35 ] ) and by allowing @xmath30 to range from @xmath210 to @xmath245 , we find that @xmath254 . indeed , @xmath254 for _ all _ values of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , in this theory @xmath1 symmetry ( reflection about the imaginary axis , @xmath255 ) is preserved , but parity symmetry is permanently broken .",
    "we believe that this means that one might be able to describe the dynamics of the higgs sector by using a @xmath226 quantum field theory .",
