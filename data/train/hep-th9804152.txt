    "maximal @xmath0 supergravity is the most symmetric of all known field theories in two dimensions , and therefore of special interest in many ways .",
    "it is classically integrable in the sense that its equations of motion can be obtained from a linear system .",
    "as first argued in on the basis of a general analysis of the hidden symmetries arising in the dimensional reduction of @xmath3 supergravity to lower dimensions , the space of associated classical solutions admits an @xmath2 symmetry generalizing the geroch group of general relativity . the relevant non - compact version of the affine lie group @xmath4 .",
    "however , most of our results will concern the associated lie algebra , which we denote by @xmath5 . ]",
    "its high degree of symmetry , the emergence of a maximally extended superconformal structure and the natural appearance of exceptional groups of @xmath6-type indicate that this theory is destined to play a prominent role in the search for a non - perturbative and unified theory of quantum gravity encompassing superstring theory and @xmath3 supergravity .",
    "in this paper we present the canonical formulation of @xmath0 supergravity and analyze its symmetry structure within the canonical framework . after a brief description of the lagrangian and equations of motion",
    ", we set up the canonical formalism and derive the complete expressions for the @xmath1 constraint generators of local supersymmetry .",
    "these results allow us in particular to complete the proof that the linear system of  which is at most quadratic in the fermionic fields  generates all the necessary higher order fermionic terms in the equations of motion .",
    "i.e.  the integrable structure of the model extends through all fermionic orders",
    ". we then proceed to work out the @xmath1 superconformal constraint algebra , which is not of the standard type .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we analyze the integrable structure of the model on the basis of an infinite set of conserved charges and their algebra .",
    "these non - local charges are determined via the transition matrices of the linear system .",
    "they are shown to commute weakly with the supersymmetry constraints , and hence the full gauge algebra ; therefore they yield an infinite set of observables .",
    "we examine the canonical algebra that is generated by the non - local charges , exploiting the fact that the final result of this calculation is unambiguous  unlike the corresponding calculation for flat space integrable models of this type , which is plagued by irresolvable ambiguities ( see e.g. ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the yangian algebra which one obtains turns out to be the same as that of the purely bosonic model .",
    "this enables us to take over the analysis of entirely .",
    "the connection of our results with previous ones on the affine @xmath2 symmetry of the classical solutions is finally established by defining the lie - poisson action of the non - local charges on the physical fields .",
    "this coincides with the known symmetry action on the fields and their associated dual potentials .",
    "the main advantage of the canonical realization of the affine symmetry is that in this way we gain complete control over the deviations of the symmetry action from a symplectic action .",
    "this issue is of particular importance when one studies the quantum mechanical realization of the symmetry .",
    "we believe that our results open new and promising perspectives for the exact quantization of @xmath0 supergravity , as it is known at least in principle how to quantize lie - poisson actions .",
    "in particular , they confirm the relevance of yangian - type deformations of @xmath5 for the classification of physical states in the quantum theory .",
    "our results could also be relevant in connection with recent developments in non - perturbative string theory .",
    "there are fascinating topics for future research in this direction , such as the search for possible analogs of d - branes , which would require reconciling the action of the geroch group with boundary conditions other than asymptotically flat ones , or the investigation of the possible relevance of the symmetry structures found here for duality symmetries in non - perturbative string theory .",
    "the lagrangian and equations of motion of @xmath0 supergravity are most conveniently derived by dimensional reduction of @xmath1 supergravity in three dimensions as described in .",
    "let us first recall its field content . in the gravitational sector",
    ", we have the zweibein @xmath8 and the dilaton @xmath9 , both of which originate from the dreibein of @xmath10 supergravity .",
    "the kaluza - klein - maxwell field @xmath11 , which is also part of the dreibein , is conventionally set to zero .",
    "it does not carry propagating degrees of freedom , but may have non - trivial holonomies on a topologically non - trivial worldsheet , and could give rise to a cosmological constant in two dimensions .",
    "although we neglect such effects here , this field can not be completely ignored because its elimination gives rise to extra quartic spinor terms which do contribute to our complete expression for supersymmetry constraint below .",
    "the dilaton @xmath9 satisfies a free field equation ( in the gravitational background provided by @xmath8 ) , and this permits us to introduce its dual `` axion '' @xmath12 _ + _ ^= 0 .",
    "the partner of the dreibein , the @xmath13 gravitino , gives rise to a gravitino in two dimensions and a `` dilatino '' according to the decomposition @xmath14 ( in flat indices ) , both of which transform as the @xmath15 representation of @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to these non - propagating fields , there are 128 physical scalar fields and 128 physical fermions transforming in the left and right handed spinor representation of @xmath16 , labeled by indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the chiral components associated with the 128 propagating fermionic degrees of freedom are designated by @xmath19 ( see appendix a.1 for our spinor conventions ) .",
    "the scalar sector is governed by a non - linear @xmath20 @xmath21-model .",
    "i.e.  the scalar fields are described by a matrix @xmath22 representing all 128 propagating bosonic degrees of freedom .    for the lagrangian and the equations of motion we need the decomposition ^-1_= 12 q^ij_x^ij + p^a_y^a , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the algebra generators of @xmath25 , see appendix [ ae8 ] .    the composite gauge field @xmath26 serves to define the @xmath16 covariant derivatives by d_^i & = & _ ^i + q_^ij^j , + d_^ & = & _ ^ + 14q_^ij ^ij_^ , d_p_^a & = & _ p_^a + 14 q_^ij ^ij_ab p_^b , and the field strength q_^ij",
    ": = _ q_^ij- _ q_^ij + q_^ik q_^kj - q_^jk q_^ki . from one reads off the integrability relations ( valid in any dimension ) d _ [ p_]^a = 0 , q_^ij + 12 ^ij_ab p_^a p_^b = 0 .      for our further considerations we employ the superconformal gauge e_^ = _^ , _",
    "^i = i_^i .",
    "we will also make use of the fields : = := - 12(_+_- ) the redefined field @xmath28 transforms as a genuine scalar under conformal diffeomorphisms , whereas @xmath29 itself is a density .",
    "the gauge choice must be accompanied by the following rescaling of the fermion fields : ^a ^12 ^a , ^i_^12 _ ^i , ^i_2 ^12 _ 2^i .",
    "then the conformal factor @xmath29 disappears almost entirely from the lagrangian , except for the einstein term which in the conformal gauge becomes -14 e r = -12_^. as a consequence the theory would be conformally invariant if it were not for the remaining @xmath21 dependence of this term .",
    "similarly , the superpartner @xmath30 of @xmath21 does not completely decouple in the gauge , as it would in a superconformally invariant theory .",
    "still , we can from now on drop the distinction between flat and curved indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 we remark that there is no problem of principle in keeping the dependence on topological degrees of freedom which are eliminated by ( i.e. the moduli and supermoduli on the worldsheet ) ; the requisite formalism has been set up in , building on earlier results in .",
    "we next list the equations of motion in the superconformal gauge .",
    "utilizing one - component spinors ( see appendix [ aspin ] ) , the fermionic equations of motion read d_(^12_^ ) & = & 12 ^ 12 ^i_2^i_ap_^a , + d_^i_&= & -12 _ ^ ^i_ap_^a , d_(^i_2 ) & = & 0 , modulo cubic spinor terms . the equations of motion for the physical scalar fields are d_+(p_-^a ) + d_- ( p_+^a ) & = & 2i^i_a d_-(^i_2+^_+ ) -2i^i_a d_+(^i_2-^_- ) + & & + 2i^ij_abp^b_-^i_2+^j_+ -2i^ij_abp^b_+^i_2-^j_- & & + 14i^ij_ab p_-^b ^_+ ^ij_^_+ + 14i^ij_ab p_+^b ^_- ^ij_^_-,_+_-  =   _ + _ -&= & - 12p^a_+p^a_- -i(^_+d_-^_+ + ^_-d_+^_- ) , modulo quartic spinor terms .",
    "the equations listed so far originate from the variation of those fields which survive the superconformal gauge fixing .",
    "there are , however , two more equations that follow by variation of the traceless modes of the metric and the gravitino , both of which are put to zero in the superconformal gauge .",
    "these are the constraints t _ & = & 12p_^ap_^a - _ _",
    "ip_^a ^i_a_2^i_^ -i_^ d__^ + & & i_^id_(_2^i ) i_2^id__^i   0 , s_^i & = & d_1(^i_2)-_^i_2 ^_^i_ap_^a _ ^i _   0 , which will be seen to generate conformal and superconformal transformations , respectively .",
    "for this reason , they enjoy a somewhat different status from the previous equations : the equations setting them to zero must be interpreted as weak equalities in the sense of dirac ( indicated by the symbol `` @xmath33 '' ) .",
    "like in superconformal field theories the derivatives of these constraints vanish strongly : _",
    "t _  =   d_s_^i  =   0 . while we do not include the cubic spinor terms in the above equations",
    ", we will give the complete terms below in the canonical expression for the supersymmetry constraint .",
    "the superconformal gauge is preserved by local supersymmetry transformations with chiral parameters @xmath34 obeying d_^i_=0 , again modulo cubic spinor terms .",
    "up to such terms , the supersymmetry variations are given by    rclrcl ^-1_&= & 2i_^i^_^i_a y^a , & _",

    "the superalgebra generated by these transformations can be regarded as an @xmath35 superconformal algebra , but it is distinguished from the standard superconformal algebras ( which stop at @xmath36 ) by the fact that it is a _ soft _ algebra ( i.e.  it has field dependent structure `` constants '' ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why , despite the evident similarities with superconformal field theories , @xmath1 supergravity belongs to a different class of models .",
    "there is no immediate analog of the left - right ( holomorphic ) factorization of conformal field theory because @xmath1 is not a free ( or even `` quasi - free '' ) theory",
    ". we will recognize this feature again when analyzing the constraint algebra .",
    "we conclude this section with some comments on the physical interpretation of the fields @xmath9 and @xmath37 , which play a special role .",
    "as is well known , one can invoke the residual conformal invariance of to identify these fields with the worldsheet coordinates at least locally .",
    "this gauge , which is the precise analog of the light - cone gauge in string theory , is complemented on the fermionic side by the elimination of the dilatino @xmath38 from the equations of motion by means of the residual superconformal transformations . for stationary axisymmetric solutions of einstein s equations ( euclidean signature of the worldsheet ) ,",
    "one traditionally takes @xmath39 as the radial variable and @xmath37 as the coordinate along the symmetry axis . for the minkowskian signature considered here ,",
    "more and physically distinct choices are possible . depending on whether the vector @xmath40 is spacelike or timelike , we can either identify @xmath9 with the radial and @xmath37 with the time coordinate ( einstein - rosen gravitational waves ) , or @xmath9 with the time and @xmath37 with the space coordinate ( in which case there is a `` big bang '' singularity at @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , one can also envisage more general situations with alternating signatures , as well as worldsheets of non - trivial topology .    from a `` stringy '' perspective ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath9 and @xmath37 should be treated as ( quantum ) fields living on the worldsheet , whose vacuum expectation values would be associated with coupling constants of the theory .",
    "the mbius subgroup of the hidden witt - virasoro symmetry of the theory is then analogous to the strong - weak coupling duality in string theory .",
    "the derivation of the of the canonical brackets from the action is straightforward , except perhaps for the technical complication that the presence of second class constraints necessitates a dirac procedure .    in the gravitational sector",
    "we have the canonical momenta 2ps .",
    "= _ 0 , 2 = _ 0 . in order not to overburden the notation",
    ", we will set _ _ 12 _ 1 , _",
    "_ 12 _ 1 , in the formulas below .",
    "furthermore , we will be exclusively concerned with equal time brackets at a fixed but arbitrary time @xmath42 , and will therefore not explicitly indicate the full coordinate dependence , but only spell out the dependence on the space coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "the equal time brackets for the dilaton @xmath9 and the conformal factor @xmath21 are given by \\{(x),(y ) } = \\{(x),ps .",
    "( y ) } = ( x - y ) .",
    "duality implies that \\{(x),_1(y ) } = 2(x - y ) , and \\{_(x),_(y ) } = (x - y ) , \\{_(x),_(y ) } = 0 where derivatives on the @xmath44 function are always understood to act on the first argument .",
    "later , we will also introduce a spectral parameter @xmath45 ( see ) depending on both @xmath46 and @xmath37 . in the canonical framework ,",
    "this spectral parameter becomes a canonical variable , and thus an operator upon quantization .    to obtain the canonical bosonic poisson brackets in the @xmath21-model sector ,",
    "we introduce conjugate momenta @xmath47 to the canonical variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 , ^ij , ^a . with \\{q_1^ij(x),^kl(y ) }  =   ^ij_kl(x - y),\\{p_1^a(x),^b(y ) }  =   ^ab(x - y ) .",
    "taking into account the zero curvature condition , the lagrangian yields _ 1 + & = & 12p_0^a y^a + i ^i_a^_1_2^i y^a + i^i_1_2^jx^ij&&-i^_0 ^^ij_x^ij , where @xmath47 is given by - ^ijx^ij+ ^ay^a . solving the above relations for @xmath50 , we arrive at p_0^a  =   ( d_1^a + 14 ^ij^ij_ab p_1^b ) + 2i^i_a^i_2+^_+y^a -2i^i_a^i_2-^_-y^a .",

    "these are the variables which commute with all the fermions and with @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , we notice that @xmath30 and the rescaled fermions @xmath52 and @xmath53 commute with @xmath54 , and hence @xmath51 as well .",
    "in this section we establish the constraint superalgebra underlying the superconformal transformations which remain after imposing the superconformal gauge .",
    "they are shown to close into a superconformal algebra which in addition contains the conformal transformations generated by and the @xmath16 gauge transformations .",
    "our most important result in this section is the expression for the supersymmetry constraint generators @xmath55 below , which is complete and includes all cubic fermionic terms .",
    "this is the crucial operator because all other constraints can be completely determined from the commutator of two supersymmetry generators ( in principle we could thus compute the quartic spinorial contributions to @xmath56 , but the explicit expressions are not very illuminating ) . in the next section we will make use of these results and demonstrate that the integrals of motion associated with the affine @xmath2 symmetry of the equations of motion weakly commute with the supersymmetry constraint .",
    "this calculation provides a stringent consistency check on the correctness of the cubic spinor terms in @xmath55 .    as discussed above , the energy momentum ( virasoro ) constraints @xmath56 descend from before going into the superconformal gauge . for the determination of canonical brackets and the constraint algebra it is , however , necessary to express @xmath56 and the other constraints entirely in terms of canonical variables . in other words ,",
    "all time derivatives implicit in the derivatives @xmath57 must be converted into momenta and spatial derivatives of the canonical variables by means of their equations of motion .",

    "its existence does not contradict the well - known absence of the standard superconformal algebras with @xmath69 , because in comparison with the algebras which have been studied in superconformal field theory , it exhibits some unusual features .",
    "let us briefly comment on the differences .",
    "first of all , unlike the usual superconformal algebras , the present model does not completely factorize into two chiral halves : this is already evident from the equations of motion , but also reflected by the fact that the chiral supercharges @xmath70 and @xmath71 in do not commute with one another .    secondly , as already pointed out before , the brackets and do not close into a linear algebra .",
    "rather , on the r.h.s   the constraints @xmath55 appear with coefficients that explicitly depend on the fermionic fields @xmath30 and @xmath72 .",
    "this was of course to be expected in view of the general result that the algebras arising in supergravity are usually `` soft '' gauge algebras .",
    "the important new feature here is that we can nevertheless give a complete canonical characterization .    finally , we stress the conspicuous absence of internal chiral current algebras which appear in the standard extended superconformal algebras .",
    "namely , a linear superconformal chiral algebra with @xmath73 supercharges requires chiral internal bosonic currents multiplying @xmath74 on the r.h.s .  of",
    "this fact can be immediately deduced from the super - jacobi identities involving @xmath75 , whose @xmath76 terms only cancel with the contribution from the additional current . by contrast",
    ", we here have only one `` vectorlike '' @xmath16 current @xmath59 ; moreover , in the algebra this current appears only in second order in the fermions and multiplies the @xmath44-function rather than its derivative .",
    "the terms required for consistency of the super - jacobi identity now originate from the additional contributions due to the field dependent structure constants on the r.h.s . of .",
    "another distinctive feature is the invariance of the generators @xmath56 under @xmath59 ; the @xmath16 constraint generator thus carries zero conformal weight , unlike the chiral currents of standard superconformal field theory .",
    "a further extension of our results which we postpone to later investigations would involve relaxing the superconformal gauge and thus entail a canonical treatment ( and quantization ) of the topological degrees of freedom as well .",
    "our main purpose in this section is to investigate the infinitely many conserved charges associated with the classical @xmath2 symmetry of the equations of motion , their algebra and the infinite dimensional symmetries they generate .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the supersymmetry invariance of these charges by showing that they weakly commute with the full supersymmetry constraints , and hence with all other constraints .      as shown in the supergravity equations of motion",
    "can be obtained as the compatibility condition of a linear system ( or lax pair ) for an @xmath77-valued matrix @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath45 is a spectral parameter which depends explicitly on the coordinates via the dilaton and the axion fields , as we will shortly explain .",

    "secondly , shows that for spatially periodic boundary conditions , the eigenvalues of the transition matrices are not necessarily integrals of motion .",
    "the reason is that periodicity of the physical fields is not enough to ensure periodicity of the dual potentials because even if we choose the the dilaton @xmath9 to be a periodic function , the spectral parameter @xmath45 will not be periodic due to the non - periodicity of the dual axion field @xmath37 .",
    "it remains an open problem to reconcile periodicity with the existence of infinite dimensional duality symmetries .      as we have already pointed out , in a theory with _",
    "supersymmetry , time independence is not quite enough to distinguish reasonable observables ( in the sense of dirac ) . in addition",
    ", these must weakly commute with the full gauge algebra . the particular constraint associated with time translations ( alias the wheeler - dewitt operator in the quantized theory ) is just one part of this gauge algebra , and follows from the commutation of two supersymmetry constraints .    in this section",

    "due to the form of the constraint superalgebra , the brackets of these charges with @xmath56 then also vanish weakly .",
    "they are thus invariant under the full gauge algebra .",
    "in particular , this implies our previous claim that the linear system does not receive any quartic corrections but captures the full content of the theory . since by supersymmetry transformations any solution can be fixed to obey the super - weyl gauge , the invariance of the linear system under supersymmetry shows that indeed no quartic corrections arise in the general case .",

    "it is straightforward although lengthy to evaluate using the form of the supersymmetry generator and the fundamental poisson brackets . up to the higher order terms in the fermions this result had already been given in .",
    "thus it remains to check the cubic fermionic terms .",
    "as we can show , all the extra cubic terms cancel with the exception of those required to complete the supersymmetry generators in to the full expressions given in .",
    "there are altogether four different sources yielding cubic fermionic terms .",

    "we see , how the terms of the type @xmath120 from all the different sources eventually cancel . in a similar way all the unwanted cubic fermionic terms in",
    "can be shown to drop out .",
    "we have thus found an infinite number of observables in the sense of dirac .",
    "we note that a similar transformation behavior has been observed in the supersymmetric extension of the nonlinear @xmath21-model .",
    "there , with suitable boundary conditions the bosonic non - local charges are invariant under global supersymmetry . in our model ,",
    "invariance under the local supersymmetry is an indispensable condition for meaningful observables , since supersymmetry appears as a constraint .",
    "we now calculate the poisson algebra of the conserved charges that we have derived above . as it turns out , it is entirely sufficient to compute the brackets for the connection coefficients entering the linear system .",
    "our key result is that the fermionic contributions conspire in precisely such a way that the canonical brackets below _ are identical with the ones obtained for the purely bosonic theory _ !",
    "this implies that , as far as the analysis of conserved non - local charges and their algebra is concerned , we can take over the analysis of the bosonic case in practically without modification .",
    "however , the realization of the algebra and hence the quantum spaces on which the algebra eventually acts will be very different in the two cases .",

    "we close this section with some remarks on the algebraic structure of the symmetry . the canonical realization given in",
    "is parametrized by meromorphic @xmath163-valued functions and yields closed expressions for the action on the physical fields .",
    "the algebra of these operators is most conveniently obtained from , which immediately shows @xmath169,g[\\l_2]\\big ] ~=~ g\\big[[\\l_1,\\l_2]\\big]\\;.\\ ] ]    half of the affine algebra @xmath5 may be recovered by formal laurent expansion around @xmath170 :   do not belong to the class of functions for which we have defined .",
    "since the integrand is singular at infinity , definition depends on the precise choice of the contour in this region , which has not been specified above . ]",
    "(w )  =  i+_1w+_2w^2 +  , the action of these modes on the physical fields follows from expansion of the respective closed formulas . in a rather formal sense may be related to the expansion g(w )  =  i+1wg_1 + 1w^2g_2 +  , obtained from by handling the linear system as a formal power series in @xmath171 .",
    "observe , however , that @xmath172 does not allow a laurent expansion around @xmath173 when the branch point moves to infinity .",
    "the conventional realization of @xmath5 also includes a representation of the other half of the affine algebra ; this is achieved by the introduction of infinitely many additional gauge degrees of freedom associated with the `` maximal compact subgroup '' @xmath174 of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , this group possesses a central extension which acts trivially on the physical fields but shifts the conformal factor @xmath21 by a constant .",
    "although so far there does not exist a canonical formulation with an enlarged phase space capturing these extra symmetries , the proper action of the central term is implied by formula , which itself is canonically generated .",
    "the form of the symmetry operators shows that this action is not symplectic but satisfies g(w)\\{f_1,f_2 } = \\{g(w)f_1,f_2 } + \\{f_1,g(w)f_2 } + , on any two phase space functions @xmath175 , @xmath176 , where the commutator on the r.h.s .",
    "is understood for the matrix - valued action of @xmath172 .",
    "this is an example of a lie - poisson action , i.e.  it does not preserve the poisson structure on the phase space but on the direct product of the phase space with the symmetry group .",
    "this fact becomes crucial upon quantizing the structure , since it is not @xmath5 but its quadratic deformation underlying according to the representations of which the spectrum of physical states will have to be classified .",
    "our ultimate interest in developing the canonical framework is in quantizing @xmath0 supergravity , and this not only in view of constructing exactly solvable and `` sufficiently complicated '' models of matter coupled quantum gravity in two dimensions .",
    "we are equally motivated by recent developments in non - perturbative string theories , where ( finite dimensional and discrete ) duality symmetries play a central role",
    ".    in standard canonical quantization one converts the poisson ( or dirac ) brackets of the basic fields into ( anti)commutators and the constraints into operators acting in a suitable hilbert space .",
    "irrespective of the possible ambiguities in this procedure , one must ensure that these operator constraints are indeed well defined in the sense that their matrix elements exist between any two states ; this may require some `` renormalization '' , such as normal ordering in string theory .",
    "the next step would be to search for physical states which by definition are annihilated by the quantum supersymmetry generators .",
    "this is a difficult task because @xmath1 supergravity is a fully interacting theory on the worldsheet , unlike the conformal supergravities giving rise to superstring theories .",
    "if the classical constraint algebra can be transferred to the quantum theory ( possibly modulo certain anomalies ) , the supersymmetry algebra would ensure that the physical states are also annihilated by the hamiltonian ( wheeler - dewitt operator ) , as well as the diffeomorphism and @xmath16 constraints .",
    "now , it would seem rather foolhardy to hope to be able to carry through such an ambitious program for the lagrangian directly .",
    "however , the integrability of the model , which is encapsulated in the existence of infinitely many conserved non - local charges , may open an alternative representation theoretic route to its quantization .",
    "clearly , the physical states should transform as a representation of the ( quantum ) algebra generated by the conserved charges . in this way",
    ", these charges would give rise to a kind of spectrum generating algebra akin to the one of string theory , which is generated by the ddf operators . to properly work out these ideas",
    "may involve an extension of the techniques that have been successfully applied to the computation of form factors of the flat space non - linear @xmath177 @xmath21-model .-matrix .",
    "however , in a theory of quantum gravity , the very notion of an @xmath178-matrix is a priori meaningless , except in those special circumstances corresponding to asymptotically flat spacetimes which allow for asymptotic states to exist . ]",
    "the crucial difference with the flat space theories is the requirement of consistency with local supersymmetry .    according to the discussion in section [ lp ] , and contrary to one s naive expectations the physical states",
    "can not be expected to fall into standard @xmath5-multiplets because the action of @xmath5 is not symplectic .",
    "even if this were the case , we note that almost nothing is known about the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath2 ; even for its finite dimensional subgroup @xmath179 , the representation theory is still only rudimentary . at any rate , a minimum requirement for analyzing the physical spectrum will thus be to find the quantum algebra underlying the classical poisson algebras and , .",
    "these structures are closely related to the yangian algebra @xmath137 , however with different analyticity properties , the novel `` twist '' structure of and the additional symmetry .",
    "quantization must respect these properties . for the models with coset space @xmath180",
    "the problem of directly quantizing has been solved in by use of several well - known results on the corresponding yangians .",
    "although @xmath145 is a much more complicated group , it turns out that the corresponding @xmath181-matrix has already been worked out in the mathematical literature .",
    "curiously , this @xmath181-matrix exists only if an extra singlet is added to the @xmath182 of @xmath145 ; in other words , the quantum @xmath183-matrix must be extended by one row and one column to a 249 by 249 matrix if it is to obey all consistency conditions .",
    "this seems to indicate that the full quantum symmetry will involve additional degrees of freedom from the gravitational sector .",
    "the quantization of @xmath1 supergravity may resolve various puzzles related to the presence of fermions . while the geroch group and its analogs",
    "are known to act transitively on the space of classical bosonic solutions ( modulo some technical assumptions ) , we do not know how to generate fermionic solutions from purely bosonic ones ( the vacuum , in particular ) , see the remarks accompanying . this would require a superextension of @xmath2 . in principle , local supersymmetry can give rise to global supercharges , but only in very special backgrounds admitting killing spinors .",
    "performing a geroch transformation on such a background will destroy this property in general .",
    "this makes the existence of a superalgebra containing @xmath5 as its maximal bosonic subalgebra somewhat unlikely .",
    "a further indication that something is amiss here is that a supersymmetric generalization of the breitenlohner - maison cocycle formula for the conformal factor has so far not been found .",
    "lastly , it is not clear what physical significance should be attached to classical solutions depending on anticommuting @xmath184-numbers . in the quantum theory",
    ", all these problems may dissolve by themselves .",
    "the first because the quantum theory may not admit purely bosonic physical states , like simple exactly solvable models of quantum supergravity in three dimensions or perturbatively treated canonical @xmath185 quantum supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "the others because the fermions become operators , and only expectation values of observables ( such as the conserved charges ) are physically meaningful quantities in quantum gravity .    finally , the geroch group and its generalizations represent infinite dimensional extensions of the duality symmetries that have played such an important role in recent developments of string theory .",
    "we have not yet studied the case of bounded `` open '' worldsheets and the effect of these symmetries on the boundary conditions ( which in the case of open strings have lead to the discovery of d branes ) .",
    "a first step in this direction would be to find out whether the geroch group can be implemented with periodic boundary conditions on the space coordinates . unlike @xmath186-duality , which simply involves an interchange of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , and thus of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , we here face the challenge of making an infinite number of duality transformations compatible with the boundary conditions .",
