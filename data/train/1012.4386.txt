    "the scaling properties of correlation functions near a critical point in equilibrium statistical mechanics have been well understood over the past few decades . however , understanding similar power - law scaling behaviours in structure functions in a variety of turbulent flows remains an open problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", significant progress has been made in the study of _ equal - time _ structure functions in the turbulence of fluids , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) and , most notably , passive - scalars  @xcite . by contrast , for symmetric binary fluid turbulence , statistical studies are still in its infancy .    to appreciate the context and the necessity for a systematic study of the scaling properties of equal - time structure functions in such symmetric binary fluid mixtures , it is important to recall some lessons from standard equilibrium critical phenomena  @xcite . for a @xmath1 dimensional spin system near a critical point , the equal - time , correlation function @xmath2 , between two spins separated by the vector @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and its spatial fourier transform @xmath5 have power - law scalings : @xmath6 where , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the temperature and the critical temperature , respectively , @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 is the external field , @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 is the wavevector , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are critical exponents , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are scaling functions .",
    "we note , in passing , that away from the critical point the correlation functions decay exponentially and the associated correlation length @xmath20 diverges near a critical point as @xmath21 , if @xmath22 .",
    "can we generalise such ideas of equilibrium statistical mechanics to the case of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence in various settings ?",
    "indeed , the power - law behaviours of equal - time structure functions , in the inertial range ( to be defined later ) , in fluid , passive - scalar or mhd turbulence have a certain similarity to the algebraic dependence on @xmath23 of correlation functions in critical theory . to make this connection explicit and",
    "lay the ground for our subsequent discussions , we begin with the increments of the longitudinal component of the velocity @xmath24\\cdot({\\bf r}/r)$ ] , where @xmath25 is the velocity of the fluid at the point @xmath26 and time @xmath27 , and the subscript @xmath28 implies the longitudinal component .",

    "the power law behaviour of such structure functions , which is valid for separations @xmath23 in the inertial range @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the kolmogorov dissipation scale and @xmath34 the large length scale at which energy is injected into the system are characterised by the equal - time exponents @xmath35 .",
    "kolmogorov s phenomenological theory @xcite of 1941 ( k41 ) for fluid turbulence , predicts simple scaling @xmath36 .",
    "subsequent experimental and numerical studies , however , strongly suggests the existence of equal - time multiscaling : @xmath35 is a nonlinear , convex , monotone - increasing functions of @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , it is important to remember that for the simplified stochastic kraichnan model @xcite of passive - scalar turbulence , multiscaling of equal - time structure functions can be demonstrated analytically .",
    "the analogue of the k41 theory for passive - scalar turbulence is due to obukhov and corrsin @xcite . for the schmidt number @xmath37 , where @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath38 is the diffusivity of the passive scalar",
    ", the obukhov - corrsin theory leads to k41 scaling exponents for the passive - scalar case .    in sharp contrast to fluid and passive - scalar turbulence ,",
    "a systematic theoretical and numerical study of the statistical properties of symmetric , binary fluid ( sbf ) mixtures in three dimensions ( @xmath0 ) is still in its early stages and experiments performed on such systems have been typically concerned with measurements of effective transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "our prime concern here is to extend the ideas of equal - time scaling and multiscaling to the turbulence of sbf . in this paper",
    "we provide for the first time , via detailed direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and a new shell model that we propose for such a system , a systematic study of the statistical properties of equal - time , two - point structure functions in a statistically steady , turbulent sbf mixture .",
    "we thus consider an incompressible , binary fluid mixture , with components labelled @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and having densities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , such that the concentration field @xmath43 is defined via @xmath44/\\rho_0 $ ] , where @xmath45 is the mean density .",
    "furthermore , since we will be interested in a _ symmetric _ , binary fluid mixture",
    "we impose the constraint @xmath46 .",
    "we elucidate the universal properties of homogeneous , isotropic sbf turbulence , in the absence of any macroscopic ( mean ) concentration gradient , by measuring the scaling exponents of the equal - time structure functions of the velocity field @xmath47 , the concentration field @xmath48 and the concentration gradient field @xmath49 .",
    "we show for the first time that although the exponents associated with @xmath50 are multiscaling ( like the exponents for @xmath47 ) , the equal - time exponents for @xmath48 show simple - scaling .",
    "our results are similar to the numerical quasi - lagrangian ( in two - dimensional flows ) @xcite and in agreement with the predictions of one - loop field theoretical @xcite studies of the sbf system .",
    "in order to describe the coupled dynamical evolution of the field @xmath51 and @xmath48 we need coupled dynamical equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "extensive analytical and numerical studies on the well - known passive scalar problem  @xcite , which is the passive limit of the system considered here , clearly demonstrate that @xmath82 has multiscaling qualitatively similar to @xmath81 .",

    "@xcite used symmetry arguments to show that @xmath85 and suggested that @xmath86 should show multiscaling akin to @xmath81 .",

    ", we confirm this in numerical studies of @xmath0sbf equations and our shell model equations .",
    "before we embark upon a discussion of our results , we explore the formal similarities between the dynamical equations of binary fluid turbulence and mhd .",
    "these become apparent when eqs .",

    "( [ navier ] ) , ( [ advec ] ) and ( [ 3dmhd ] ) are noteworthy : ( i ) the concentration gradient field @xmath50 and the magnetic field @xmath88 have the same _ nave _ dimensions ( which in turn is the same as the nave dimensions of the velocity @xmath47 ) ; and ( ii ) the non - linear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ navier ] ) and ( [ advec ] ) have analogues ( in the sense of the number of field and gradients ) in eqs .",

    "nevertheless , these rg studies have been criticised for a variety of reasons @xcite such as using a large value for @xmath106 in a small-@xmath106 expansion and neglecting an infinity of marginal operators ( if @xmath107 ) .",
    "these criticisms of the approximations , however justified they may be , can not be used to rule out the randomly forced model as an appropriate theory for sbf turbulence . in this paper",
    ", we use random gaussian forcing in all our numerical simulations .",
    "we end this section by summarising the key results in this paper .",
    "our studies yield many interesting results : the multiscaling exponents for @xmath47 and @xmath50 fields which we obtain from @xmath0sbf and our shell models agree [ figs .",

    "as is well known in turbulence , it is important to resolve the large ranges of both temporal and spatial scales well . a dns approach to hydrodynamical partial differential equations , such as",

    "it is thus useful to consider simplified models of turbulence that are numerically more tractable than the partial differential equations themselves .",
    "_ shell models _ are important examples of such simplified models ; they have proved particularly useful for testing ideas of multiscaling in fluid , passive - scalar and mhd turbulence  @xcite . keeping this in mind , we derive below a new shell model for the gradient of the concentration field in the sbf system and solve it numerically to obtain results in support of our dns results .",
    "we should point out that for sbf turbulence , a shell model was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalar concentration field and its coupling with the fluid field .",
    "shell models can not be derived from the hydrodynamical equations in any rigorous way .",
    "such models are constructed on a basis of a discretised fourier space with logarithmically spaced wave vectors @xmath116 which are associated with shells @xmath117 and dynamical complex , scalar dynamical variables which mimic , e.g. , velocity increments @xmath118 over scales @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , we impose that @xmath120 be a scalar because spherical symmetry is implicit in gledzer - ohkitani - yamada ( goy)-type shell models which study homogeneous , isotropic turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic discretisation of the fourier space allows us to reach very high reynolds number ( which are impossible using dns in present - day computers ) even with moderate values of @xmath121 , where @xmath121 is the total number of shells .",
    "the temporal evolution of such a shell model is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations that have certain features in common with the fourier - space version of the hydrodynamical equation .",
    "thus , the shell model analogue of the navier - stokes equation , for example , will have a viscous - dissipation term of the form @xmath122 and nonlinear terms of the form @xmath123 that couple velocities in different shells .",
    "( we note in passing that gradients appear as products of @xmath120 in shell models . ) in the navier - stokes equation all fourier modes of the velocity are coupled to each other directly but in most shell models nonlinear interactions are limited to shell velocities in nearest- and next - nearest - neighbour shells .",

    "we find that @xmath191 exhibit multiscaling similar to fluid turbulence in the inertial range , whereas @xmath192 exhibit simple @xmath193 k41-scaling ( within error bars ) .",
    "moreover , the probability distributions @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath194 $ ] are nearly overlapping and have tails longer than that of @xmath167 $ ] for @xmath23 in the inertial range .",
    "we also propose a new shell model for the gradient of the concentration field and numerically solve it as well as the shell model for scalar concentration field .",
    "our results from our shell models are in agreement with our dns studies .",
    "our results are @xmath0 analogues of those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where simulations with particles in @xmath195 flows were used to show that the structure functions of the concentration field for the sbf problem _ do not _ multiscale .",
    "the results from both our dns of the sbf equations and shell - model studies are complementary to and agree well with each other and bring out the multiscaling of the velocity and concentration gradient fields and simple scaling of the concentration field .",
    "the validity of these conclusions is strengthened not only by the reliability of the scaling ranges usually associated with the measurement of equal - time structure functions in shell models , but also by the convincing pdfs that we obtain for various quantities in our dns and the clear evidence of statistical convergence which justifies measurements of equal - time exponents upto order 6 in our dns .",
    "our results may be explained from the analytical framework based on symmetry arguments developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the presence of an additional continuous symmetry ( kind of a gauge symmetry ) , not present in the passive scalar turbulence model , is responsible for the simple scaling behaviour of @xmath82 .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the properties of the turbulent ness of sbf at low temperature , below the consolute point , when instabilities leading to phase separation competes with turbulent mixing .",
    "work is in progress in this direction .",
    "finally , our results may be tested in experiments similar to ref .",
