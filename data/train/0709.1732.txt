    "the theory of the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) is now well developed and can be calculated quantitatively in many systems .",
    "@xcite however , x - ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) calculations have remained only semi - quantitative at best.@xcite one of the reasons for this disparity is a lack of accurate treatments of inelastic losses in the near edge region .",
    "for example , traditional calculations of exafs typically rely on simplified or semi - phenomenological models of inelastic losses in terms of a complex , energy - dependent exchange - correlation potential , i.e. , the quasi - particle self - energy @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the quasi - particle energy .",
    "in addition a many body amplitude factor @xmath0 must be applied to the exafs signal to account for intrinsic losses , though this is frequently ignored or considered to be a free parameter.@xcite two commonly used models for the self - energy in x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) are i ) the hedin - lundqvist plasmon - pole model , and ii ) the dirac - hara exchange approximation plus a constant complex potential .",
    "@xcite since the self - energy is smoothly varying at high energy and relatively small compared to the kinetic energy , these approximations are often adequate for exafs .",
    "however , variations in the self - energy tend to be large in the xanes region , i.e. , within the first 50 ev above the fermi energy , and neither of the above models describes this variation correctly .",
    "the energy scale mentioned above is set by the dominant excitations in the system , and is comparable to the mean plasma frequency @xmath3 , which is typically about 10 - 30 ev .",
    "thus the exafs ( characterized by weak scattering due to large loss ) and xanes ( characterized by large scattering and low loss ) regions correspond to low and high energy relative to @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the variation in @xmath1 with energy leads to significant errors both in amplitude and peak positions in the xanes .    in an effort to improve on these simplified models we present here a many - pole gw approximation for the self - energy , @xcite based on real space multiple - scattering calculations of the inverse dielectric function for a given system . our goal is to develop an approach which can be applied routinely both for exafs and xanes .",
    "analogous many - pole models have been used previously in calculations of the self - energy,@xcite and of the inelastic mean free path ( imfp),@xcite with experimental optical data as input .",
    "a few first principles approaches that make use of pole approximations have also been developed.@xcite for example ref .",
    "makes use of a band - lanczos algorithm to calculate a many - pole approximation to the inverse dielectric matrix . for reviews of other approaches to gw calculations",
    "see refs .   and .",
    "our many - pole model yields semi - quantitative self - energies over a wide range of photoelectron energies from the near - edge to about @xmath4 ev , which is adequate to cover both the xanes and exafs regions.@xcite the approach has a number of advantages for practical calculations .",
    "first the method is computationally efficient in that only a few cpu hours are required to calculate the dielectric function , self - energy , and spectral function for a given system .",
    "this is significant since xanes calculations typically take several cpu - hours , while full gw self - energy calculations over the complete energy range of xas experiments are currently impractical . finally , the approach is applicable to a wide class of materials including metals , insulators , and molecular systems .",
    "the strategy of our treatment of inelastic losses is as follows .",
    "we begin with a first principles calculation of the energy loss spectrum @xmath5 $ ] in the long wavelength limit @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite next this loss function is incorporated into a many - pole model for the self - energy which is an extension of the single plasmon - pole model of hedin and lundqvist.@xcite this self - energy yields system dependent extrinsic losses due to the lifetime of the quasi - particle over a broad energy range .",
    "next , to account for intrinsic losses , i.e. , losses due to excitations of the system in response to the sudden creation of the core hole , we apply our many - pole model to a calculation of the quasiparticle spectral function using an extension of the gw approximation based on the quasi - boson model.@xcite this yields corrections to the quasi - particle approximation for xas in terms of a convolution of the quasi - particle absorption spectrum with the spectral function .",
    "moreover , the approach naturally includes interference terms between extrinsic and intrinsic losses and describes the crossover from the adiabatic- to sudden - approximation limits .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the single plasmon - pole gw model for the self - energy , together with our extension to many poles .",
    "we then describe our approach for calculating the dielectric function at zero momentum transfer , as well as the extrapolation to finite momentum transfer .",
    "next we compare our results for the self - energy and the imfp with other calculations , as well as with experimental results for the imfp .",
    "subsequently we present our calculation of the quasiparticle spectral function and it s relation to the self - energy .",
    "we then compare our calculations of xafs with experimental as well as theoretical results .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss possible improvements .",
    "the many - pole model for the self - energy developed here is an extension of the plasmon - pole ( pp ) model of hedin and lundqvist,@xcite and contains many of the same ingredients .",
    "thus we begin with a brief description of the pp model , and subsequently describe the extension to a more general loss function used in this work .",
    "a more detailed description of the plasmon pole model is given in appendix [ ppapp ] . throughout this paper",
    "all quantities are given in hartree atomic units ( @xmath7 ) unless otherwise noted .",
    "we begin with the gw approximation for the self - energy@xcite of a homogeneous electron gas in the momentum representation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi momentum . in frequency space",

    "this contribution arises from the creation of virtual bosons .",
    "the integrals over frequency and solid angle can be performed analytically@xcite , leaving an expression for @xmath17 in terms of a single integral over momentum transfer @xmath18 .",
    "this formulation has been used extensively to calculate the mean self - energy @xmath1 within the lda over a broad range of energies for exafs spectra.@xcite the pp approximation works well at high energies and more generally for systems with sharp plasmon - peaks in the inverse dielectric function ( e.g. , al ) , which can be described by nearly free electron gas models . on the other hand",
    "the model often loses accuracy at low energies for transition metals , insulators and molecules with more complex loss spectra , and in practice often gives unphysical structure to the self - energy near @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    in order to improve on the plasmon - pole approximation , we now introduce a more realistic representation for the inverse dielectric function , using a sum over discrete poles .",
    "this representation preserves the analytical character of @xmath19 , and corresponds to a distribution of bosonic excitations describing the dielectric response of a material , including both interband and intraband excitations .",
    "the inclusion of this excitation spectrum in the self - energy naturally broadens the single pp model in a way which is characteristic of a given system .",
    "moreover , the representation can be systematically improved .",
    "[ excfig ]    two steps must be accomplished in order to extend the pp self - energy to a many - pole self - energy ( mpse ) : i ) the first step is to obtain a suitable approximation to the energy loss function @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this can be done either by calculation , as is done here , or from experimental optical constants .",
    "ii ) the second step is to extend the @xmath21 result to finite momentum transfer , by representing it as a weighted sum of poles , each of the form eq .",
    "( [ spepseq ] ) , which together conserve the overall strength .",
    "in addition we approximate the single particle green s function @xmath22 as that for a free particle .",
    "this is the first term in the multiple - scattering expansion and ignores fine structure ; hence the calculated self - energy represents a uniform average . with these conditions",
    "the net self - energy is simply the hartree - fock exchange contribution plus a dynamically screened exchange - correlation contribution which is given by a weighted sum of single pole terms , @xmath23 with weights @xmath24 and plasma frequencies @xmath25 . as mentioned above , @xmath26 is given by a single integral over momentum transfer @xmath27 , making the calculation quite efficient .",
    "[ excfig ] illustrates the self energy from our many pole model for cu .",
    "note that only 20 poles were needed to converge this calculation , despite the relatively broad loss function of cu .      in our approach the inverse dielectric function",
    "is calculated using the real - space green s function ( rsgf ) method as follows : first , a modification to the rsgf code feff8@xcite is used to calculate the total absorption cross section @xmath28 for a given material over a broad spectrum , by summing the contributions from all occupied initial states.@xcite the results presented in this paper make use of atomic initial states .",
    "however current developments allow for the description of a continuous band of initial states within the feff real space ms framework,@xcite which may further improve the results . the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath29 is directly related to the total absorption cross section per atom @xmath28 as calculated by the feff code . @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the atomic number density and @xmath32 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the real part @xmath33 is then obtained via a kramers - kronig transform , and finally @xmath34 $ ] is formed by inverting @xmath35 .",
    "this could be a computationally demanding operation .",
    "however , because the self - energy involves an integral over @xmath19 , the fine structure can be neglected in all but the lowest energy part of the dielectric function ( i.e. , the first 20 ev ) , as shown in fig .  [ fsfig ] .",
    "this approximation considerably reduces the computational effort .",
    "it should be noted that this prescription for the calculation of the loss function also neglects local field effects due to the off diagonal components of the dielectric matrix .",
    "nevertheless , the method has been shown to give reasonable agreement with experiment for a variety of materials.@xcite moreover , neither the self - energy nor the absorption spectrum ( i.e. exafs and xanes ) are highly sensitive to details of the loss function provided the overall weight is conserved since these quantities are given by integrals over the loss function .      in order to extend the inverse dielectric function to finite momentum transfer @xmath36",

    "our prescription for this match is as follows : first , the loss function is split into @xmath42 regions , each of which is represented by a single pole . for each region of width @xmath43 , the pole strength and position are chosen to preserve first and first - inverse moments , yielding the equations defining @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 , \\\\",

    "this approximation has been checked against a dispersion relation which maintains the width of the pole at high momentum transfers and gives similar results for materials with a broad loss function such as cu , ag , and diamond . for materials with a sharp loss function ( i.e. al , si , and na ) this approximation may not be adequate at low energies ( below the plasmon energy ) where the contribution from the particle hole continuum can dominate the loss .    finally , for very low energies ( i.e. , the first few ev where our multiple - scattering calculations are least reliable ) the calculated loss function must be corrected . for metals a drude term",
    "is added and otherwise a uniform shift of the frequencies @xmath47 is carried out while scaling the resultant poles , so that the inverse moment matches either empirical values or accurate calculations of the static dielectric constant @xmath48 , while leaving the first moment unchanged . for stability",
    "we have found it important to preserve the inverse first frequency moment , since this ensures cancellation of the logarithmic singularity in the derivative of @xmath15 at @xmath49 and @xmath50.@xcite this singular behavior otherwise shows up as a sharp rise in @xmath51 $ ] within the first 10 - 20 ev above @xmath52 . in metals , where cancellation is perfect , re [ @xmath53 is fairly flat near e=@xmath52 . in insulators , however , this singular behavior is found to enhance the jump in re [ @xmath54 .",
    "thus our prescription requires a separate estimate either of the static dielectric function @xmath48 for the case of insulators or the drude parameters for metals and semi - metals .",
    "these quantities have been used previously to parameterize the dielectric matrix,@xcite for example ref .",
    "uses similar parameters to modify a single pole model of the dielectric function , while refs . and",
    "generalize to a full dielectric matrix .",
    "our self - energy model is similar to those of penn@xcite and horsch et al.@xcite for the valence contribution .",
    "one difference is that our formulation neglects the relatively small particle hole continuum contributions below the plasmon onset .",
    "another is that our formulation includes a first order correction to the quasipartle energy as well as a renormalization constant @xmath55 which accounts for the quasiparticle spectral weight .",
    "appendix [ hlqeqapp ] gives a short discussion of the equivalence of the formulas for the self - energy given by quinn ( which is the starting point for penn s calculations ) and by lunqvist .",
    "a further note must be made regarding the difference between our many - pole model and the lda implementation in the feff8.2 code .",
    "the plasmon frequency in the current lda model in feff8.2 is dependent on the electron density as a function of spacial coordinates . in the model discussed here , adding spacial dependence greatly complicates the theory and is therefore ignored .",
    "thus our approach gives the spacially averaged quasiparticle correction for the whole system .",
    "we have found that in the xanes region , the self - energy effects on the spectrum are not sensitive to the density dependence . also our calculations use the interstitial density to determine the fermi momentum ; the interstitial density was chosen , instead of the average density , because we want the model to capture the behavior of the self - energy due to interaction with the valence electrons .",
    "for the core electrons feff8 already has an option to use a non - local dirac - fock exchange which can be applied with our many - pole model.@xcite",
