    "the most recent simulations of ionizing uv breakout from pop iii protostellar disks show that accretion onto the star may be terminated at only a few tens of solar masses @xcite , although 60 - 600 @xmath0   stars are still possible .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of their extreme luminosities @xcite , single pop iii stars will not be visible even to the coming generation of 30-m telescopes ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "two other lines of observation may reveal the properties of pop iii stars , the first being direct detection of their explosions .",
    "non - rotating pop iii stars from 10 - 40 @xmath0  die as core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne ) and 90 - 260 @xmath0  stars can explode as pair - instability ( pi ) sne @xcite . a recent arc of radiation hydrodynamical simulations has shown that pi sne will be visible in the near infrared ( nir ) at @xmath3 15 - 20 to the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) , the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) and the thirty - meter telescope @xcite and that cc sne and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) will be visible out to @xmath3 10 - 15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another path to constraining the pop iii initial mass function ( imf ) is to look for the chemical fingerprint of the first sne on later generations of stars .",
    "the basic idea is that if stars of lower and lower metallicity can be found , a few will be encountered that formed in the debris of the very first sne .",
    "if these chemical patterns can then be reconciled with the nucleosynthetic yields of specific pop iii explosions ( or a well defined population of them ) they could reveal important clues about the masses of the first stars .",

    "* ) . in these faint events , which have energies",
    "an order of magnitude lower than most sne of this mass , the innermost shell of ejecta with elements such as si and fe likely falls back onto the central compact object during the explosion .",
    "this process could explain the near absence of iron group elements in j031300 .",
    "but mixing between adjacent shells of elements during the explosion could offset fallback in the final elemental yields of a pop iii sn because hydrodynamical instabilities can dredge elements deep in the ejecta up to a higher mass coordinate , beyond the grasp of the bh or neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) explosion models , even those with extensive nuclear reaction networks , therefore can not predict the chemical yields of low - energy pop iii sne from first principles . mixing on small scales in the explosion",
    "must also be understood to predict the metallicities of the stars that form in the debris of the sn because it sets the initial conditions on mixing , cooling and collapse of gas on larger scales in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . mixing in pop iii cc and pi sne",
    "has previously been studied by @xcite and on larger , cosmological scales by @xcite .",
    "we have performed the first two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations of faint pop iii sne with the ` castro ` code to determine if their elemental yields are a good match to those of j031300 . in section 2 our progenitor stars , ` castro ` models .",
    "mixing , elemental yields , observational signatures are examined in sections 3 and 4 , and we conclude in section 5 .",
    "our two fiducial models are the core - collapse explosions of 12.4 @xmath0  and 60 @xmath0  pop iii stars ( the z12 and z60 models , respectively ) .",
    "they were chosen because preliminary 1d explosion models of these stars done with the ` kepler ` code yielded elemental abundances that are in good agreement with those of j031300 .",
    "besides , they fall in the massive window of pop  iii stars and their stellar structure is different . unlike previous work , we use an extremely high - resolution 2d simulations to carry out these runs . since these runs are very computational expensive , therefore we were afford to carry two representative models and present them in this paper .",
    "both stars were first evolved from the zero age main sequence to the onset of core collapse with the 1d stellar evolution code ` kepler ` @xcite as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the explosions were then triggered with a linear momentum piston with energies of 0.6 b and 1.8 b , respectively ( where 1 b = 10@xmath6 erg ) .",
    "after the launch of the piston , a shock forms at the base of the silicon burning shell .",
    "the post shock temperature drops below @xmath7 k within ten seconds and most nuclear burning ends . at this point profiles for the ejecta ,",
    "the star and the surrounding medium are mapped onto a 2d cylindrical grid in ` castro `",

    "to resolve fluid instabilities in 2d , we use @xmath29 zones on the root grid and up to eight levels of amr for an additional factor of up to @xmath30 in resolution .",
    "this approach yields an effective simulation domain of @xmath31 zones .",
    "we adopt refinement criteria based on gradients in density , velocity , and pressure and ensure that the inner core , where most fallback occurs , has the highest resolution . reflecting and outflow boundary conditions are set on the inner and outer boundaries in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . the monopole approximation for self - gravity , in which a 1d gravitational potential is constructed from the radial average of the density ,",
    "is used to calculate gravitational forces everywhere in the amr hierarchy .",
    "this approximation is valid because the star is nearly spherically symmetric .",
    "the gravity of the ns or bh is included in our models . in both cases the explosion is evolved until the ejecta reaches the outer boundaries of the grid .",
    "the initial velocity of the shock is lower than those in most cc sne because of their smaller explosion energies .",
    "the innermost regions of the ejecta , which are also at the tail of the velocity profile , do not have enough kinetic energy to escape the gravity of the ns or bh , as we show in figure  [ fig : initv ] .",
    "the peak velocities are 7.4 @xmath32 10@xmath8 cm s@xmath33 for z12 and 5.2 @xmath32 10@xmath8 cm s@xmath33 for z60 .",
    "we define the escape velocities from the central neutron star , @xmath34 , the gravitational constant @xmath35 , ns mass @xmath36 , and the distance to ns @xmath27 .",
    "it is likely that inner ejecta with velocities below @xmath37 will fall back onto the ns for 1d models .",
    "however , fluid instabilities occur during fallback in multidimensional simulations that can dredge up material with velocities close to but @xmath38 and eject it from the star .",

    "[ fig : initv ] ]    ]    the shock breaks out of z12 much sooner than from z60 ( at 1,659 sec vs 25,600 sec ) because of its much smaller radius ( it dies as a compact blue giant rather than a red supergiant like z60 ) .",
    "the shock crashes out into a diffuse circumstellar medium ( csm ) with a density profile @xmath39 .",
    "this profile was chosen to avoid the formation of a reverse shock after breakout , which would cause additional mixing that is not inherent to the explosions themselves .",
    "the growth of fluid instabilities in z12 and z60 is shown in figures [ fig : evol ] .",
    "prominent rt fingers form and mix the @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and small part of @xmath18  shells in z12 .",
    "there is less mixing in the outer shell in z60 but fallback breaks the spherical symmetry of the inner shells . mixing in both models at shock breakout is shown in figures [ fig : break ] .",
    "figure [ fig : homol ] shows the distribution of the metal - rich ejecta at @xmath40 .",
    "fallback has now essentially ceased and the ejecta expands homologously with an internal energy that is less than 10% of its kinetic energy .",
    "we show the distribution of various metals in the ejecta at this stage in figure [ fig : metals ] .",
    "strong mixing of @xmath13  and @xmath15  is visible in z12 but the shells are more stratified in z60 .",
    "most of the mixing in z60 occurs in the central regions and is associated with fallback .",
    "iron group elements dredged up by mixing may escape fallback and alter the composition of the ejecta . in the end",

    "a shell of carbon and oxygen is ejected and elements heavier than silicon mostly fall back to the compact remnant .",
    "we summarize our yields in table  [ tbl : iso1 ] and compare them with previous 1d results in figure  [ fig : yield ] . since the 1d models can not follow the fallback process from the first principles . in this sense , 1d yields are usually obtained by assuming a certain amount of ejecta fallback onto its central compact objects _ ( mass cut)_. such an assumption is very crude because it prevents any element under the cutting - line to possibly appear in the yields .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that violent mixing naturally occurs in these weak explosions .",
    "isotopes of atomic number @xmath41 20 have a great chance to appear in the final yields . for j031300 ,",
    "its observational data is limited and only provides a measured abundance of @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 . and upper limits for other isotopes .",
    "the 1d and 2d yields fit well on @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 .",

    "mixing is caused by the fluid instability during the explosion . here",

    "this initial explosive environment may lead to a even more violent mixing which is not considered in our present study .",
    "the yields are also determined by mixing on the much larger scales than those of the sn .",
    "for example , in the simplest scenario second - generation stars form in gas swept up by the sn remnant .",
    "when the ejecta plows up roughly its own mass in the halo a new reverse shock can form , driving more mixing @xcite . later",
    ", there could be a third stage of mixing when the ejecta collides with the dense shell of the relic h ii region of the star at 100 - 200 pc , perhaps cooling and fragmenting it @xcite .",
    "these fragments can then collapse into new stars via metal , molecule and dust cooling . capturing all these processes with high resolution cosmological simulations is necessary to match both abundances and metallicities of any given metal - poor star to a specific sn .",
    "it should be noted that metal - poor stars in the second generation could form in more complicated enrichment scenarios , such as ejecta from a ccsn explosion overrunning a nearby halo , mixing with it , and triggering new star formation @xcite .",
    "thus , multiple enrichment channels may have to be tested by numerical simulations to reconcile the abundances of a specific extremely low metallicity star to a pop iii sn .",
    "the low energy sne in our study may be more common than the highly energetic ( and asymmetric ) explosions invoked in the past to explain the unusual abundances of hyper metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these rare events require special conditions in order to occur , such as rapid rotation .",
    "in contrast , the new sn factories such as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ? * ) and the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ?",
