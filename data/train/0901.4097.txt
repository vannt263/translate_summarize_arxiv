    "as a carbon nanotube has only a few conducting channels , it is not obvious how the long - ranged coulomb interactions can be screened .",

    ". we looked into this issue carefully and found that the effective lattice model of the zigzag nanotube differs from that of the armchair .",
    "ignoring the interactions momentarily , by integrating out the gapped modes ,  @xcite the metallic zigzag nanotube is described by an effective two - chain system ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "note that the interchain hopping is absent in this effective lattice model . as a consequence ,",
    "the fermi velocities remain degenerate when the nanotube is doped away from half filling .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the fermi velocities in the armchair nanotube are equal to each other _ only _ at half filling and become different at finite doping .",
    "as we will explain later , the degeneracy of the fermi velocities in the zigzag carbon nanotube is crucially important for dynamical symmetry enlargement ( dse ) at finite doping .",
    "in addition to the subtle velocity degeneracy at finite doping , the differences between the zigzag and armchair nanotubes effective lattice models become obvious when one tries to write the effective interactions . it turns out that , after integrating out the gapped modes , the effective interactions for the zigzag are far more complicated that those for the armchair .",
    "we reanalyze the correlation effects in the effective two - leg lattice model with the one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) and the non - perturbative bosonization techniques . due to the spreading of the wave function ,",
    "the effective interaction strength is reduced to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of unit cells around the circumference and @xmath9 are the on - site and the nearest - neighbor repulsions .",
    "this reduction in the effective interaction strength is crucially important as it allows the weak - coupling rg analysis to be valid provided @xmath10 .",
    "the one - loop rg flows determine the instabilities which may then be analyzed by non - perturbative bosonization ( and refermionization ) in order to identify gaps in different charge and spin sectors . from this , not only can the phase diagram be determined , but our numerical results also reveal dynamical symmetry enlargement ( dse ) of low - energy excitations above the ground state .",
    "@xcite for a truly weak interaction strength @xmath3 , dse occurs and the system is described by the gross - neveu model with an enlarged so(6 ) symmetry .",
    "the exact solution gives _ eight - fold _ kink / antikink excitations in the low - energy limit .",
    "this differs from the usual behavior of two decoupled single chains which exhibit spin - charge separation but only have four - fold degenerate spinons .",
    "it is also not the same as the fully gapped two - chain systems , where spinons and holons are glued together by long - range gauge interactions , originating from various gaps in the charge and spin sectors .",
    "we also numerically compute the anomalous scaling of the gap / coupling ratios associated with the enlarged so(6 ) symmetry . for bare couplings with approximate so(6 ) symmetry , previous analytic calculations based on perturbation theory predict a universal exponent of @xmath11 for the scaling functions of the gap / coupling ratios .",
    "surprisingly , not only do we verify the predicted exponent numerically , we also find that the exponent is robust even for large deviations in the bare couplings !",
    "finally , for realistic material parameters @xmath5 , the charge sector decouples and ruins the so(6 ) symmetry but there remains an enlarged so(4 ) symmetry in the spin sector , indicating an unexpected degeneracy between the usual three - fold magnons and an additional neutral particle - hole excitation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way : in sec ii , we derive the effective lattice model for the zigzag carbon nanotube at finite doping . by carefully taking the underlying lattice structure into account , we write down the effective interactions for the on - site and nearest - neighbor repulsions . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how the field theory description can be derived from the effective lattice model by chiral - field decomposition .",
    "then , the bare couplings in the field - theory limit can be determined from the effective lattice model . in sec iv ,",
    "the results of the one - loop rg are shown . from the bosonization technique , the phase diagram of the ground state is obtained .",
    "we also show how dse emerges from the numerics in weak coupling . in sec .",
    "v , we consider the anomalous scaling behavior rising from the finite strength of interactions .",

    "may be mapped onto a two - leg ladder .",
    "@xcite here the @xmath21-axis is defined to be in the longitudinal direction of the nanotube and the @xmath28-axis is around the nanotube . due to the translational invariance around the nanotube",
    ", advantage is taken of the fact that the momentum must be quantized in the @xmath28 direction , @xmath29 the significant momenta are those which coincide with the dirac points , i.e. , the zeros of the energy spectrum .    in the weak coupling limit @xmath30",

    "\\label{eq : nnh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to emphasize that the factor @xmath49 comes from the underlying honeycomb lattice after a partial fourier transformation and can not be gauged away by shifting the second sublattice by @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , since the electrons are delocalized around the nanotube , both the effective on - site and nearest - neightbor interactions are suppressed by @xmath51 .    the effective hopping hamiltonian in eq .",

    "( [ eq : onsiteh ] ) and ( [ eq : nnh ] ) now resemble an effective two - leg ladder . however , they are quite different from standard two - leg ladder hamiltonians .",
    "the two - leg ladder hamiltonian usually describes hopping and nearest neighbour interactions both along legs and across rungs , with the rungs positioned at right angles to the legs .",
    "however , in the zig - zag nanotube case the hopping only occurs along legs , and not across rungs .",
    "in addition , the effective interactions are far more complex than the ordinary density - density interactions .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the next - nearest neighbor interaction really complicates the story since it reflects the underlying lattice structure .",
    "in fact , if one goes through the same mapping , it is straightforward to show that the effective interactions of @xmath1 and @xmath52 for the zigzag and armchair nanotubes are different . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective interaction of @xmath0 can be shown to be equivalent by a simple ( but subtle ) gauge transformation .",
    "to determine the ground state of the effective two - leg model , the combined usage of one - loop rg and bosonization is extremely powerful . in order to proceed , one needs to obtain a field theory description of the lattice model in the continuous limit . when considering weak interactions , a two - leg ladder is usually diagonalized so that the hopping hamiltonian is written in terms of two decoupled bands .",
    "however , in our case the two legs are already decoupled in the hopping hamiltonian , making any diagonalization unnecessary . in the low - energy limit",
    ", the lattice operators may be linearized about the fermi points and expressed in terms of chiral fields .",
    "for the first sublattice , the chiral - field decomposition is rather standard , @xmath53 .",
