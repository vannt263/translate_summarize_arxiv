    "recently , four - spin exchange interactions have been attracting interest in spin ladder models and spin - orbital models , because these interactions in fact appear in many systems@xcite and can induce exotic ground states.@xcite various types of four - spin interactions appear associated with diverse mechanisms , e.g. , cyclic - exchange processes,@xcite coulomb repulsion between doubly degenerate orbitals,@xcite and spin - phonon couplings . though two - leg antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin ladders show a rung - singlet ground state and have an energy gap between the ground state and excitations,@xcite it was revealed that four - spin exchanges can induce a gapped staggered dimer ( or spin - peierls ) phase@xcite and a gapless phase@xcite around the su(4)-symmetric point and that a gapped phase with a dominant vector chirality correlation also appears.@xcite    very recently , luchli , schmid , and troyer@xcite numerically found a new scalar chiral phase in the two - leg spin-1/2 ladder with four - spin cyclic exchange .",
    "scalar chiral states , in which both the time - reversal and parity symmetries are broken , had been discussed in the context of anyon superconductivity@xcite and the anomalous hall effect,@xcite but realization of scalar chiral order in su(2)-symmetric systems had been difficult and a challenging problem . a scalar chiral order due to the four - spin cyclic exchange",
    "was first proposed on the triangular lattice for magnetism of solid @xmath1he films,@xcite though finite - size system analysis could not find evidence for such ordering , instead showing spin - liquid ground states.@xcite study of spin ladders with four - spin exchanges is expected to clarify the possibility of exotic magnetism induced by the four - spin interactions .    in this paper , we study the two - leg spin-1/2 ladder with four - spin exchanges , whose hamiltonian is given in the next subsection , and give a rigorous example of a scalar chiral ground state . in our analysis , the spin - chirality duality transformation we introduced in ref .   plays an important role .",
    "a new class of models that have an exact ground state with scalar chiral order are constructed by the means of matrix - product ansatz .",
    "the scalar chiral phase has the following nature : ( i ) the ground states are doubly degenerate , ( ii ) there is a finite energy gap between ground states and excited states , ( iii ) the ground states have long - range staggered scalar chiral order and exponentially decaying spin correlations , and ( iv ) a @xmath2 symmetry is fully broken .",
    "it is also found that the phase boundary of the scalar chiral phase touches the su(4)-symmetric point and the su(4)-symmetric model is on a multicritical point surrounded by the staggered dimer phase , the staggered scalar chiral phase , and the gapless phase .",

    "[ sec : exact_gs ] and [ sec : su4 ] .",
    "we now consider the transformation of the spin states on rungs .",
    "since the total spin on each rung is conserved under the transformation , the fully polarized spin state @xmath27 is transformed to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) denotes the spin state operated by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the pseudospin state operated by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , respectively . by applying @xmath35 and @xmath36 to @xmath28 ,",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_ext4 ] ) is , thus , self - dual at the surface defined by @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 the parameter space of the hamiltonian has six dimensions in total , and the self - dual surface divides the parameter space into two regions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it should be remarked that the su(4)-symmetric model ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) exists on the self - dual surface .",
    "duality around this specific model will be discussed in sec.[sec : su4 ] .      here",

    "one can show that the hamiltonian is invariant under this transformation as @xmath54 for arbitrary @xmath55 if @xmath46 .",
    "thus the self - dual models are isotropic under the continuous rotation with the generator @xmath56 , whereas the @xmath44-term of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_ext4_2 ] ) lowers the symmetry .",

    "it should be noted that this @xmath114 symmetry is independent of the @xmath116 chiral symmetry associated with the scalar chirality , since the scalar chiral operator after the nonlocal unitary transformation @xmath117 has the corresponding @xmath114 symmetry .",

    "iii the exact ground state has an energy gap and the scalar chiral order .",
    "we now discuss the phase diagram around the su(4)-symmetric point , and the two su(2 ) @xmath5 su(2 ) models given above , considering the following generalized hamiltonian : @xmath146 this hamiltonian contains two kinds of perturbation to the su(4)-symmetric model . because of the duality , phase boundaries are symmetric with the line @xmath147 .",
    "the nature of phases in @xmath148 is related to that in @xmath149 by the duality transformation .",
    "the above consideration leads to a conclusion that the su(4)-symmetric point is a multicritical point and surrounded by the staggered dimer phase , the staggered scalar chiral one , and the critical one .",
    "if the scalar chiral phase touches with the staggered dimer phase , the phase boundary between two phases must exist exactly on the self - dual line @xmath147 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_su4 ] ) .",
    "because of the u(1 ) symmetry , a rigorous theorem@xcite concludes that in general both orders disappear on the self - dual line and hence the transition between the scalar chiral and dimer phases is second order , but , if uniform susceptibility of @xmath150 diverges , both orders can exist on this line .",
    "note that the latter actually happens in the model ( [ eq : solvable2 ] ) .",
    "one plausible phase diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd_su4 ] .",
    "recently we have numerically studied this phase diagram and obtained results consistent with the present conclusion.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have shown a rigorous example of scalar chiral ground states in su(2 ) spin ladders with four - spin exchanges .",
    "the exact duality relation is the keystone of our theory .",
    "our results demonstrated that four - spin exchanges can actually induce the scalar chiral long - range order .",
    "the scalar chiral phase extends to a wide parameter region and touches with the su(4)-symmetric point .",
    "previously , a scalar chiral phase was numerically found in the four - spin cyclic exchange model on the two - leg ladder.@xcite in their phase diagram , the scalar chiral phase appears next to the staggered dimer phase and the phase boundary indeed exists on the self - dual point@xcite @xmath151 .",
    "this situation in the vicinity of the self - dual point shows a resemblance to that around the self - dual line ( @xmath152 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_su4 ] .",
    "our recent numerical study of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_ext4 ] ) indicates that the scalar chiral phase we found in this paper extends to the four - spin cyclic - exchange case and that two phases belong to the same one .",
    "we have shown that the su(4)-symmetric model is self - dual under the spin - chirality duality transformation .",
    "we here note that this statement holds for the su(4 ) spin - orbital models on arbitrary lattices . recently",
    "su(4 ) spin - orbital models on two - dimensional lattices@xcite and on ladders@xcite have been studied and it was discussed that a plaquette ordering may appear in the ground state . on a four - site plaquette , the su(4 ) singlet state is the unique ground state and therefore it must be self - dual under the duality transformation . we hence conclude that plaquette ordering is also self - dual .",
    "last , we discuss the universality classes of phase transitions .",
    "the phase transitions into the scalar chiral phase are naturally in the same universality class as the dual transitions into the staggered dimer phase .",
    "for example , since the phase transition between the rung - singlet phase and the staggered dimer phase belongs to the @xmath153 su(2)@xmath154 criticality,@xcite we conclude that the transition between the scalar chiral phase and the rung - singlet phase also belongs to the same one .",
    "since the two - dimensional ising model is related to the @xmath155 criticality , this @xmath153 criticality can be plausibly regarded as a consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
