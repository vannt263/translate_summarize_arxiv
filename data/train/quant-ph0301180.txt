    "atomic motion is an unavoidable element in the consideration of any amo system and an integral part of experimental designs in atom trapping devices . at issue here is the interaction between the internal degrees of freedom of an atom , assumed to contain an effective two - level system ( qubit ) , and the electromagnetic field ( emf ) , modified by the atom s quantal motional degree of freedom .",
    "this problem has two aspects : 1 ) how does the two level activity affect the atomic motion ? and 2 ) how does atomic motion affect the two level activity ?",
    "the first aspect is the basis for laser cooling and atom trapping , which have been studied in great detail and successfully implemented by well - known experiments ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is aimed at the second aspect , specifically , how quantized motion affects the qubit - emf system dynamics , which is of interest in the design of quantum computers based on atomic qubits ( in the form of a neutral atom @xcite or ion @xcite ) in a qed cavity or optical potential .",
    "effects on internal dynamics due to quantized center of mass ( com ) motion have previously been studied in the situations of an atom in free space @xcite , in a cavity @xcite , and when the atom s qubit and com degrees of freedom are entangled @xcite . however ,",
    "all have focused on spontaneous emission rather than decoherence .",
    "the present work probes the non - markovian regime of atom - emf interaction , under the modest aim of explicitly computing how entanglement with quantized motion through recoil affects the decoherence and relaxation rates of an atomic qubit in free space . in order to achieve that end ,",
    "we first discuss two issues of importance in computations of _ coherent _ reduced dynamics , using path integral methods . + * the importance of including back - action * + it is well - known that the interaction between a two - level system ( 2ls , or qubit ) and the emf is the primary source of its relaxation and decoherence , while effects associated with the atom s motional degrees of freedom are usually relegated to the background . assuming that the atom moves adiabatically limits one s consideration to those circumstances wherein the external degrees of freedom act merely as a passive parameter in the environment ( here comprised of the emf and atomic motion ) of our system ( the qubit ) , with no dynamical interplay . in technical terms , this amounts to a ` test - field ' approximation  that the qubit lives in a fixed environment defined by a set of parameters , amongst them the adiabatic motion .",
    "the test field approximation leaves out effects of changes in the environment on the system . to include the effects of the environmental variables",
    "_ dynamically _ it is essential to perform a self - consistent back - action calculation .",
    "this was done for the effect of a cavity emf on the 2la in ref .",
    "@xcite . + * full coherence requires self - consistent treatment * + in tackling problems where many factors enter , it is useful to isolate one factor after another so that the remaining factors of interest to us can be simplified enough to yield some solution . for quantum coherence and entanglement such simplifications can lead to erroneous results , since phase information is lost if one artificially isolates the linking components of the complete quantum system",
    "this brings up the necessity of self - consistency in any treatment of quantum coherence and entanglement issues .",
    "in the present case of a qubit in an emf this requires that the fully entangled system of atomic 2ls ( internal ) , the emf , and the center of mass ( external ) degrees of freedom be treated coherently as a whole and each factor involved be allowed to evolve under the influence of the others in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this self - consistency requirement leads to non - markovian dynamics since memory effects arise naturally and are necessary to preserve maximal coherence during the evolution . + * grassmannian and coherent state representation of influence functional * + a theoretical scheme we found satisfactory in meeting these requirements is the influence functional ( if ) formalism of feynman and vernon @xcite or the related closed - time - path ( ctp ) effective action of schwinger and keldysh @xcite .",
    "the influence of the environmental variables on the system of interest is incorporated in the if ( or effective action ) in such a way that the equations of motion obtained for the system will already have included the back - action of the environmental variables on the system in a dynamically self - consistent manner .",
    "this scheme has been applied to a two - level atom ( 2la ) interacting with an electromagnetic field ( emf ) in reference @xcite . there , a first - principles derivation of the general master equations is given and applied to the study of the decoherence of a 2la in an emf , for the cases of a free quantum field and a cavity field in the vacuum at zero temperature .",
    "the authors found that for the standard resonant type of coupling characteristic of such systems the decoherence time is close to the relaxation time .",
    "here we use the influence functional method for the treatment of the back - action of the quantum field and the quantal motion of the atom on the qubit . in section",
    "ii we compute the transition amplitude between an initial and final state using a coherent state label for the ( bosonic ) states of the emf and a grassmannian for the ( fermionic ) 2ls .",
    "the coherent state basis allows us to identify the hilbert space of states with a space of coherent states .",
    "the sum over all quantum evolutions is then a sum over all paths in this space .",
    "once the transition amplitude is computed in some sufficiently simplified form , forward and backward versions can be combined and reduced to form the reduced density matrix evolutionary operator . in section iii we calculate the evolutionary operator for the reduced density matrix when the emf and motional degrees of freedom are integrated over .",
    "we derive an equation describing the evolution of the on and off - diagonal elements , the latter is the coherence function we seek .",
    "we end in section iv with a discussion of our results and comments on possible further developments on this subject .",
    "our system is a 2-level atom interacting with its own center of mass ( com ) motion and the emf .",
    "we begin with a modified multi - mode jaynes - cummings type hamiltonian ( e.g.  dipole and rotating wave approximation , see appendix a of ref@xcite ) , @xmath0.\\ ] ] the first term in the hamiltonian is the com kinetic energy .",
    "the next two terms are the qubit and emf energies , respectively .",
    "the last two terms are the interaction between the qubit , emf , and the atom s com degree of freedom .",
    "note that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both operators .",
    "coupling of the qubit to its com motion is through the spatial mode functions of the emf .",
    "we shall restrict our consideration to an initial vacuum emf at zero temperature .",
    "the result of this calculation will thus be the modification of the vacuum decoherence and relaxation rates of a qubit when the effects of quantized atomic motion are included .    the first step towards obtaining the reduced system dynamics while retaining the full system s coherence is to compute the transition amplitudes between the initial and final states which are the matrix elements of the evolution operator of the full system .",
    "we do this with coherent state path integrals . for the emf",
    "we use a bosonic coherent state representation and for the 2-level system ( qubit ) degree of freedom we use the grassmannian coherent states @xcite .",
    "coherent states are by definition generated by the exponentiated operation of the creation operator and a suitable label on a chosen fiducial state : @xmath3 in the case of bosonic coherent states defined in eq .",

    "the chosen fiducial states are the emf vacuum and the lower 2-level state , respectively .    in order for any set of states to be useful for the decomposition of the transition matrix they must have a resolution of unity .",
    "the emf and grassmannian coherent states have the following decompositions of unity @xmath6 with the measures @xmath7 grassmann coherent states also share other well known properties of coherent states such as being non - orthogonal and eigenstates of the annihilator : @xmath8 the center of mass or external degree of freedom can be represented in either the position or momentum basis . in the coherent state basis",

    "one can conclude tentatively that in general amo implementations , motion - induced decoherence of a free qubit is negligibly small . since the calculation done here is coherent and non - markovian , one can view our result as confirming the validity of the adiabatic approximation in alkali atom qubits .",
    "although the result of the calculation is the expected one , the technique described here is the first able to compute the decoherence of a qubit coupled to its own quantized com without any form of markovian approximation , while allowing the qubit - emf coupling to be the non - linear form derived from the emf spatial mode functions .",
    "useful applications of this method will include any situations in which the com motion of an atom back - acts onto its internal qubit dynamics and the full multi - mode structure of the emf is relevant .",
