    "the recent discovery of fe - based superconducting compounds @xcite has stimulated the research of unconventional superconductors .",
    "one of the most important and still unsettled issues is the symmetry of the superconducting gap function .",
    "so far , different experiments produce conflicting results .",
    "as regards measurements of the penetration depth and the nmr relaxation rate , a power law behavior at low temperatures is now clearly established , which is a signature of unconventional order parameter symmetry .",
    "one possible scenario of a pairing symmetry state is a superconductor consisting of two relatively small semimetallic fermi surfaces , separated by a finite wave vector @xmath1 with the relative phase @xmath0 between the two order parameters .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath2 model , first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that @xmath3 model with strong impurity scattering can explain the power law behavior of the nmr relaxation rate .",
    "therefore it is important to extend this formalism to address microwave properties of a two - band @xmath2 superconductor , in particular the magnetic field penetration depth and real part of complex conductivity , since experimental data are now available for single crystals of fe - based superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the microwave response and the nmr relaxation rate for a model @xmath2 superconductor in which impurity scattering is treated beyond the born limit and discuss the relevance to the experimental data for fe - based superconducting compounds .",
    "we describe a multiband superconductor in the framework of the eliashberg approach equations for the renormalization function @xmath4 and complex order parameter @xmath5 as shown in the first reference of @xcite , the bcs approach can give highly inaccurate results in the case of interband superconductivity due to the bcs neglect of mass renormalization .",
    "in addition there is evidence for strong - coupling in the pnictides , with many experimentally determined @xmath6 ratios substantially exceeding the bcs value of 1.76 , and so we therefore employ the eliashberg equations .    on the real frequency axis",
    "they have the following form , assuming an _ uniform _ ( band - independent ) impurity scattering ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) @xmath7where @xmath8 $ ] . for our model @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ^{2}-\\phi _ { j}^{2}(\\omega ) } $ ] and @xmath12 is a partial density of states .",
    "@xmath13 is the normal - state scattering rate , n(0 ) is the total density of states ( i.e.summed over both bands ) at the fermi level , _ c _ is the impurity concentration , and @xmath14 @xmath15 ^{2}}{1+\\left [ \\pi n(0)v\\right ] ^{2}}$ ] is the impurity strength ( @xmath16 corresponds to the born limit , while @xmath17 to the unitary one ) .",
    "the kernels @xmath18 describe the _ electron - boson interaction _ and have forms    @xmath19 , \\]]where the spin - fluctuation coupling function is @xmath20 for the equation for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for the equation for @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the coupling constant pairing band @xmath25 with band @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the spin fluctuation frequency .",
    "note that all retarded interactions enter the equations for the renormalization factor @xmath23 with a positive sign .",
    "we note that the implementation of the band - independent impurity scattering is contained in the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "1 , where the @xmath28 is applied to both bands ( albeit with a relative minus sign in the first equation due to the order parameter sign change between bands ) .",
    "we have chosen such a band - independent scattering for several reasons , including consistency with the previously published work and to avoid a proliferation of parameter choices .",
    "however , recent work of senga and kontani @xcite suggests that this assumption is justified on an experimental basis .",
    "their fig .",
    "4 shows that only @xmath29 between 0.9 and 1 is consistent with the several sets of nuclear spin relaxation rate t@xmath30 data showing @xmath31 behavior over a very large temperature range .",
    "the theoretical rationale for such a comparatively large interband scattering rate remains unclear , but can be plausibly related to the inherent disorder in these systems , with the dopant atoms themselves acting as scattering centers .",

    "the full expression is proportional to eq.[sig_imp ] when @xmath74 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but in multiband systems @xmath75 and @xmath76 can behave differently .",
    "it is well known that pair - breaking impurity scattering can induce substantial sub - gap density of states , which can produce power - law low temperature behavior in a whole host of thermodynamic quantities , such as specific heat , london penetration depth , nuclear spin relaxation rate , and even optical conductivity .",
    "such behavior has been well - studied in the two canonical limits of weak ( born ) scattering and strong ( unitary ) scattering @xcite , but the intermediate regime has received almost no attention .",
    "in addition , with the advent of the multiband superconductivity in mgb@xmath77 and the apparent multiband , _ primarily interband _ superconductivity in the pnictides , comes a need for further study of the intermediate regime in an interband case .",
    "recent studies @xcite have addressed the effects of impurities in the pnictides , but only in the born or unitary limits .",
    "here we study the important and likely more realistic intermediate regime , with @xmath78 , effectively the scattering strength is varied in the range from @xmath79 corresponding to the born limit to @xmath80 corresponding to the unitary limit . as stated earlier , for all calculations the impurity scattering rate @xmath81 .",
    "we will now illustrate the above discussion using specific numerical models .",
    "first , we present numerical solutions of the eliashberg equations using the spin - fluctuation model for the spectral function of the intermediate boson : @xmath82 , with the parameters @xmath83mev , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the rather large coupling constants are an attempt to model the rather large experimentally observed ratio @xmath6 .",
    "this set gives a reasonable value for @xmath86k .",
    "a similar model was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe optical properties of ferropnictides .",
    "this model was also      used in @xcite and for consistency is used here .",
    "as stated earlier , we further assume that each surface features the same gap @xcite , and that the intraband impurity scattering rate and interband scattering rate are both equal to @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the low - temperature limiting value of the superconducting gap @xmath89.as in @xcite , we have chosen a relatively large impurity scattering , which is to be expected considering the early state of pnictide sample preparation and the limited availability of large single crystals .",
    "we begin with the density of states , shown below in figure 1 .",
    "several effects are apparent .",
    "firstly , for all three @xmath92 values the substantial peak usually present at @xmath93 ( about 6 mev here ) is substantially truncated , with much spectral weight transferred below the gap . however , the detailed sub - gap behavior depends radically upon the scattering strength @xmath92 .",
    "the near - born case @xmath94 still retains a small minigap of approximately 1.5 mev , which will lead to exponentially activated behavior below about 4 kelvin .",
    "although some data has shown evidence for such exponentially activated behavior , there is also significant data showing power - law behavior .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath95 shows a monotonically increasing density of states and essentially no minigap , leading to power - law behavior , as proposed in parker .",
    "finally , the near - unitary case @xmath96 also shows a monotonically increasing density of states , but is nearly constant at low energy .",
    "we will see that such behavior leads to a quadratic temperature dependence of the penetration depth , even without the assumption of the strict unitary limit .",
    "al . _ some time ago noted @xcite in a different context that t@xmath90 behavior does not require the unitary limit .",
    "we note parenthetically that the behavior depicted depends rather strongly upon the large value of impurity scattering assumed ; the first two cases will yield more exponentially activated behavior if the scattering rate is much less strong , while the near - unitary case can potentially @xcite lead to a non - monotonic density of states .    in figure 2",
    "is shown the inverted squared london penetration depth @xmath97 , the so - called superfluid density for several cases as indicated in the figure . in all cases",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath97 is different from the standard two - fluid ( gorter - casimir ) model @xmath98 $ ] , that is similar to the bcs result .",
    "due to the sign change between gaps , the _ interband _ component of the scattering matrix is strongly pair - breaking , analogously to magnetic scattering in s - wave superconductors . as a result",
    ", the superfluid density shows near - exponential character at low temperature in the near - born case ( @xmath99 ) , while the other two cases ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) exhibit power - law behavior at low t , with the actual power varying between 2 and 3 .",
    "a more detailed view of the low - temperature @xmath102 power law behavior is presented in figure 3 , which shows @xmath103 for the same three cases .",
    "we see that the near - born limit case ( @xmath94 ) approaches a t@xmath91 behavior , reminiscent of a two fluid model , while the near - unitary case shows a fairly robust t@xmath90 behavior and the intermediate case falls between these two limits , as one would naively expect .",
    "experimental data available so far exp_lambda1,exp_lambda2,exp_microwave are consistent with either t@xmath90 , or t@xmath91 or exponential ( gapped ) behavior .",
    "within our model , both results can be explained by proper choice of the impurity scattering rate .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath104 dependence we obtain corresponds to strongly gapless regime .",
    "similar results were obtained recently in ref.@xcite but in the born limit only .",
    "figure 4 shows the calculated real part of the microwave conductivity for the three cases above . the microwave conductivity ( fig .",
    "4 ) @xmath105 does not show the coherence peak near @xmath106 .",
    "the suppression is connected with strong - coupling effects ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "below @xmath106 the behavior of the @xmath105 is determined by the filling of the impurity induced states below @xmath107 qualitatively it is similar to the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , but in the latter case the hebel - slichter peak is additionally reduced for @xmath2 model by the different kind of the coherence factor .",
    "almost all of the non - canonical bcs behavior derives from the interband component of the scattering matrix , which results in near constant behavior at low t for the near - unitary case , as might be expected from the form of equation [ sig_imp ] , in which a squared density of states enters .",
    "the intermediate case shows power law behavior as well , with the precise exponent not extracted .",
    "finally we turn in figure 5 to the nuclear spin relaxation rate @xmath108 for the same three @xmath92 scenarios .",
    "note also that following convention we have plotted @xmath109 rather than t@xmath110 , and all power - law references here mean @xmath111 .",
    "t@xmath112 has been a source of substantial controversy in the pnictides due to the existence of several data - sets @xcite showing near - t@xmath90 behavior throughout nearly the entire temperature range , although there now exist data @xcite deviating from this behavior .",
    "several things are apparent from the plot : first of all , the near - born limit case shows power law behavior ( @xmath113 ) throughout nearly the entire temperature range below t@xmath114 , although it will ultimately revert to exponentially activated behavior at the lowest temperatures .",
    "substantial impurity scattering in the born limit can thus mimic much of the behavior commonly ascribed to nodes , as was noted in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate case shows an approximate t@xmath115 behavior , as was described in @xcite , which is largely driven by the monotonic density of states presented in figure 1 , where the same parameters are chosen .",
    "korringa behavior results in the near - unitary limit , as is again a direct consequence of the corresponding behavior of the density of states in figure 1 , but does not result in either of the first two cases unless the scattering rate @xmath28 is increased significantly beyond @xmath87 .",
    "it should now be clear that impurity scattering in various strengths ( i.e , @xmath116 ) , if sufficient impurity concentrations are present , can produce a wide variety of power - law behaviors in many thermodynamic quantities , even in the near - born limit . in the s@xmath117 state , interband impurities are clearly much more effective in creating such behavior .",
    "this has implications for the ongoing lively debate about pairing symmetry , with significant numbers of proposals for nodal superconductivity in the pnictides and some experimental evidence for such behavior .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the microwave response and the nmr relaxation rate for a superconductor in @xmath2 symmetry state by solving eliashberg equations with a model spectrum and taking into account impurity scattering beyond the born limit .",
    "we show that the @xmath118 temperature behavior of the penetration depth and the nmr relaxation rate at low temperatures can be reproduced in this model .",
    "we have also demonstrated the dramatic effect of the impurity scattering on the real part of the microwave conductivity , which in particular results in near constant behavior at low t for the near - unitary case .",
