    "relativistic heavy ion experiments are performed in order to observe and prove the existence of a new form of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a number of qgp observables rely on accurate measurement of the low transverse to the beam momentum ( @xmath2 ) particle spectrum .",
    "such measurement can provide an accurate interaction source size ( as obtained from pion correlations ) , better temperature information , improved strange and multistrange particle reconstruction .",
    "for these reasons , large scale heavy ion experiments use vertex detectors and in particular silicon trackers , in order to deal with the high multiplicity of the collisions .",
    "star experiment at rhic uses a 3 layer silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) and alice at lhc a 6 layer inner tracking system ( its ) . for particle momenta below @xmath3",
    "there is significant increase of the multiple coulomb scattering effect which results in a very poor momentum determination when standard track fitting methods are applied . despite the very good position resolution of the silicon trackers ( 10 - 20 @xmath4 ) , the momentum resolution is @xmath5 for @xmath6 .    the purpose of this paper is to present an alternative method which can provide an improvement in the momentum determination by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "the momentum is directly determined from the @xmath0 measurement of every reconstructed track using the mean measured @xmath7 .",
    "the reasons for this dramatic improvement are : first , in the @xmath8 region for silicon the de / dx distribution is narrow and can be fitted by a gaussian with a small standard deviation , and second the slope of @xmath9 curve is large so that two neighboring distributions @xmath10 have a small overlap . consequently one can use the mean @xmath11 of a track and the bethe - bloch curve to obtain a momentum with a relatively small error ( around @xmath12 ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the first section we present an analytical proof of the method s validity , in the second section a simulation for a particular tracker is performed as an application of the method and finally the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we show analytically using the well known bethe - bloch formula and the landau @xmath0 distribution for pions traversing a thin silicon layer , that the expected error in the the momentum determination of the incident pions is of order @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "we start with the bethe - bloch formula @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rest energy of the electron , @xmath16 the charge of the travelling particle , n the number density of electrons in the matter traversed and @xmath17 the mean excitation energy of the atom . from ( [ eqn : bethe ] ) one can see that at low momenta the @xmath0 falls fast like @xmath1 ( the @xmath1 region ) , then goes through a minimum and rises very slowly for larger momenta . for a value of the momentum",
    ", @xmath0 is distributed according to the landau distribution .",
    "a set of landau distributions for pions going through @xmath18 of silicon with a momentum in the range @xmath19 is generated .",
    "some of these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ landau ] .",
    "one can immediately see that the distributions are separated in the @xmath1 region and they get wider as the momentum decreases .",
    "it will be shown that the width of the distributions alone induces a relatively small error in the momentum determination of the beam .",
    "the overlap of the distributions though , makes a reliable momentum estimation impossible away from the @xmath1 region because a value of the de / dx corresponds to a momentum range greater than 1 gev wide .",
    "thus it is only in the @xmath1 region where the overlap is minimum that we can apply our method . in fig .",
    "[ dp_err ] we show the momentum error induced by the landau distributions alone ( i.e. errors due to overlap were not included ) . for a particular momentum",
    "the momentum error was determined as follows :    * the @xmath0 was mapped to a momentum using the bethe - bloch formula ( [ eqn : bethe ] ) .",
    "a momentum distribution was created about the original pion momentum .",
    "* we obtained the distribution of the ratio @xmath20 and fitted assuming it follows the gaussian distribution . *",
    "the momentum error plotted in fig .",
    "[ dp_err ] is the standard deviation of the fit : @xmath21 we will call ( [ eqn : res1 ] ) the momentum resolution which is an index of the accuracy of the particle momentum determination .    in fig .",
    "[ dp_err ] we see that the momentum resolution ranges from 6 to 14@xmath22 in the interesting momentum region .",
    "the error bars come from the uncertainty that enters our caclulation due to the fit . as we already mentioned the landau distributions overlap for close enough momenta even in the @xmath1 region but",
    "no significant overlap occurs for distributions with momenta larger than one standard deviation of ( [ eqn : res1 ] ) . as a result",
    "the momentum resolution in the @xmath1 region is @xmath23 . in this momentum region",
    "the momentum resolution obtained from standard fitting techniques is dominated by the multiple coulomb scattering and is of order @xmath24 or higher @xcite,@xcite , for a few layer silicon based tracking detectors .",
    "the above result comprises the central point of this paper : for few layer silicon based detectors with good hit energy loss @xmath25 reconstruction efficiency , the momentum is more accurately determined from the @xmath0 distribution in the low @xmath26 region ( @xmath1 region of the @xmath0 plot ) than from standard fitting methods .",
    "in this section our technique is applied on the star - svt @xcite .",
    "this detector consists of three concentric cylindrical layers covered with silicon drift detectors of @xmath27 thickness .",
    "svt is capable of performing stand - alone tracking using the @xmath28 coordinates of the 3 hits that a charged particle leaves when it crosses the detector . the tracking efficiency ( i.e. the percentage of triplets of hits which correspond to the actual tracks that crossed the detector ) is about @xmath29 for the low momentum region and for tracks that originate from the main collision vertex ( primary tracks )",
    ". these tracks ( in the region below @xmath30 ) are mostly pions ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath32 of the svt has been extensively studied @xcite and the results show that the resolution is rather poor for @xmath33 . for primary tracks the momentum resolution @xmath34 while for secondary tracks @xmath35 .",
    "these numbers are in agreement with estimates for a 3 layer tracking detector from analytical empirical formulae @xcite .",
    "to apply our method in svt we use the @xmath0 information as follows :    1 .",
    "we generate the pion @xmath0  versus  @xmath36 band using simulations that are verified by experimental data .",
    "this is done by sending pions of known momentum through the detector and extracting their @xmath25 .",
    "we obtain the landau distributions @xmath37 for various momenta using a @xmath38 momentum step .",
    "every point in these landau distributions corresponds to the truncated average @xmath0 of a track . by truncated we mean that the maximum de of the three hits is rejected and that @xmath39 . in this way",
    "the long tail of the landau distribution is reduced generating a more gaussian - like distribution .",
    "the mean @xmath0 for each landau distribution is obtained by performing gaussian fit ( fig .",
    "[ dedx_p ] ) .",
    "after we collect a set of mean values for a range of momenta from @xmath38 to @xmath40 , we fit them using a polynomial fit to obtain an analytical expression for the mean @xmath41 this expression maps the measured @xmath42 of a track to a momentum ( fig .",
    "[ dedx_p ] ) . after tracking and standard fitting ( typically helix fit )",
    "have been performed , we replace the momentum of the tracks with @xmath43 with the momentum obtained from ( [ eqn : mde ] ) .",
    "[ svt_pimp ] shows the obtained momentum resolution for pions . in the momentum region below @xmath44 one can see that the average momentum resolution is @xmath45 while for momenta greater than @xmath44 the resolution is greater than @xmath46 because the method can not be applied there and the momentum was obtained from a helix fit .",
    "we expect that our method will be really useful for this low momentum region that only the silicon tracker can be used for tracking .",
    "[ svt_pimp ] clearly demonstrates that in the low momentum region the method provides at least a factor of two improvement of the momentum resolution . in these simulations a perfect knowledge of the energy loss @xmath25 in the silicon was assumed . in reality",
    "the @xmath25 of each hit on a wafer carries a measurement error which finally affects the momentum correction . on the other hand silicon detectors are capable of a quite accurate measurement of the @xmath25 .",
    "another problem is the tracking efficiency for low momentum tracks ; when a hit does not belong to a track the corresponding @xmath25 measurement is wrong and this will affect the momentum correction .",
    "our simulations include the tracking efficiency errors .",
    "in this paper a new method for improving the momentum determination of low momentum particles in silicon trackers was presented .",
    "the method was applied to a heavy ion experiment detector and an improvement of the momentum resolution by more than a factor of two was found .",
    "the method can be applied to any silicon detector that provides good @xmath25 information as in star - svt at rhic and alice at cern .",
    "knowledge of the pion momentum ( @xmath47 ) with an accuracy better than @xmath48 can allow for interaction source size measurement using pion correlations , collision temperature studies , secondary soft pion reconstruction from @xmath49 decays and searches for pion excesses predicted in the qgp phase at low @xmath26 .",
