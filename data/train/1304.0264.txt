    "recent years have seen a wide range of high - precision experiments , which study the light - matter interactions of trapped ions @xcite , single quantum dots @xcite , colour centres @xcite , and molecules on surfaces @xcite .",
    "what all of these systems have in common is that an external laser excites a strongly - confined ground state electron into an excited state , which results in the spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "so - called artificial atoms , like quantum dots and colour centres , often have much stronger spontaneous decay rates @xmath0 and significantly smaller transition frequencies @xmath1 than real atoms and ions . as a result",
    ", they provide a new testing ground for standard quantum optical models .",
    "this includes models that take into account the decoherence of the atom - field system due to the presence of an external environment .",
    "an efficient way of obtaining insight into the structure and dynamics of laser - driven atomic systems in the presence of decohering environments , is to perform measurements on the electromagnetic signals associated with their resonance fluorescence .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt an open systems perspective to investigate the power spectrum associated with the total electric field generated by a laser - driven atomic system capable of spontaneously emitting photons . as in classical physics",
    ", we define the power spectrum in terms of a correlation function @xmath2",
    ". however , our quantum correlation function reflects a much richer inner dynamics of the atomic system .",
    "this is because quantum measurements strongly effect the state of the quantum system being measured .",
    "measurement outcomes can therefore be highly correlated with previous measurements .",
    "a noteworthy aspect of our approach is that the continuous loss of memory between the atom and the surrounding free radiation field is explicitly taken into account @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by assuming the presence of a decoherence mechanism for the atom - field system .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the atom - field system is surrounded by a photon - absorbing environment .",
    "this photon - absorbing environment acts as a monitor of the radiation field , which at each @xmath3 time step performs a photon - number resolving measurement of the field @xcite , and subsequently resets it into its vacuum state @xmath4 .",
    "we call the parameter @xmath3 that determines the frequency of these measurements the typical environmental response time @xcite . moreover , following zurek @xcite , the field vacuum @xmath4 can be termed the _ einselected _ state of the radiation field . in the absence of a photon source , but in the presence of a photon - absorbing environment , the vacuum is the only state that does not evolve in time .",
    "this makes it the preferred state into which the radiation field rapidly relaxes once a photon has been emitted by the atom .    as in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we avoid approximations whenever possible .",
    "for example , instead of simply applying the rotating wave approximation , we emphasize that it is possible to obtain an atom - field hamiltonian without counter - rotating terms by means of a unitary transformation that ( partially ) diagonalises the coulomb gauge hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this is a crucial point within our model , because the effect of the photon - absorbing environment depends on the presence of counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "when such terms are present , the continuous resetting of the radiation field onto the vacuum state actually pumps free - energy into the atom - field system .",
    "this is because the presence of counter - rotating terms implies that the bare ground state @xmath5 consisting of no photons and the atom in its ground state , has _",
    "greater _ energy than the ground state of the interacting atom - field system .    when markovian and rotating - wave approximations are avoided , the continuous resetting of the field onto the vacuum results in a build up of energy , which manifests itself in the form of a non - zero stationary state photon emission rate even in the absence of external driving @xcite .",
    "such emission rates would be visible in actual experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , if we assume on physical grounds that an un - driven atom should not emit photons from its stationary state , then we must conclude that the photon - absorbing environment resets the field onto the vacuum state associated with the so - called rotating - wave hamiltonian , which contains no counter - rotating terms @xcite .",
    "the above assumption of continuous environmental resetting over a relatively short time scale , comprises an extremely strong physical constraint to be imposed on the atom - field system .",
    "we therefore expect it to have non - trivial consequences for the coarse - grained dynamics of observables pertaining to the radiation field . in this paper",
    "our aim is to investigate these consequences .",
    "we do this by calculating the power spectrum associated with the electric field generated by the laser - driven atomic source , and comparing this spectrum to the so - called mollow spectrum @xcite .",
    "our hope is that our analysis provides new insights into the dynamics of laser driven atom - field systems in the presence of decohering environments .",
    "we find that the electric field spectrum as well as the mollow spectrum have many similarities .",
    "for sufficiently strong laser driving both spectra exhibit a central peak with two sidebands , but the relative height of these peaks is different .    before continuing we note that the electric field produced by a microscopic atomic source may be difficult to accurately measure in practice .",
    "such a field is only likely to induce a very small electromotive force on a chosen test charge .",
    "the field is also expected to drop - off rapidly with increasing distance from the source .",
    "however , recent technological advances @xcite have paved the way for observing extremely small forces .",
    "for example , usenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently demonstrated the detection of sub - attonewton forces at millikelvin temperatures by using a superconducting quantum interference device .",
    "other authors employ quantum point contacts as sensitive displacement detectors in high precision experiments which aim at quantum limited displacement detection @xcite .",
    "moreover , the technology which is needed to combine a single quantum dot and an atomic force microscope cantilever in a single experimental setup has already become available @xcite .",
    "there are five sections in this paper . in section [ back ] ,",
    "we summarise the theoretical background of this paper , we provide a definition of the power spectrum of a classical signal , identify the electric field observable @xmath6 which corresponds to the above mentioned rotating wave hamiltonian , and discuss the validity of the two - level approximations and the use of a master equation . in section [ field ] , we derive the power spectrum associated with the electric field observable @xmath6 of a laser - driven atomic two - level system with spontaneous photon emission and show that this spectrum has a central peak at the atomic transition frequency @xmath1 .",
    "section [ mollow ] compares this spectrum with the usual mollow spectrum @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in section [ conc ] .",
    "in classical physics , the power spectrum @xmath7 of a signal @xmath8 equals the modulus squared of its fourier transform @xmath9 . to prevent @xmath10 from tending to infinity for a wide range of signals",
    ", one defines @xmath11 with the truncated and time averaged fourier transform @xmath9 given by @xmath12 for a real signal @xmath8 , this definition implies @xmath13 where the limits on the right hand side are assumed to exist . after making the substitution @xmath14 , we find that the power spectrum of a signal equals the fourier transform of its two - time correlation function @xmath2 , @xmath15 with @xmath2 defined by @xmath16 we are interested in the total electric field generated by the atom , so for a detector located at position @xmath17 , we consider the signal @xmath18 our hope is that an analysis of the spectrum associated with @xmath19 might provide new insights into the dynamics of atom - field systems in the presence of decohering environments .",
    "we assume in the following that a wire at a position @xmath17 and time @xmath20 , performs a direct measurement of the electric field generated by the atomic system . in this section",
    "we identify the _ atomic _ operator that represents this electric field , under the assumption of continuous environmental resetting of the radiation field onto its vacuum state . to begin with , we consider an atomic dipole with canonical operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dipole interacts with a transverse electromagnetic field with canonical field operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 = { \\rm i } \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{\\it ij}^{\\rm t}({\\bf{x}}-{\\bf{x } } ' ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the transverse delta function .",
    "these fields support the following mode expansions @xmath28 where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are photon annihilation and creation operators satisfying the bosonic commutation relation @xmath31 = \\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta({\\bf k}-{\\bf k } ' ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each vector @xmath32 with @xmath33 in eq .",

    "as such , for @xmath45 we have in the eda that @xmath46 next we determine the appropriate operator with which we must represent this observable .    here",
    "we are assuming that the radiation field is continuously reset onto the field vacuum associated with the rotating - wave hamiltonian . in order to determine the effect this assumption has on the dynamics of the electric field",
    ", we must identify within the rotating - wave representation , the operator that represents the physical field @xmath47 .",

    "if we denote the coulomb gauge hamiltonian by @xmath53 , then within the two - level approximation and with the above choice for the parameter @xmath54 , the hamiltonian @xmath55 possesses no counter - rotating terms in its interaction component .    in order to identify the operator representing the total electric field in the rotating - wave representation we note that in the coulomb gauge @xmath56 and in the eda @xmath57 thus",
