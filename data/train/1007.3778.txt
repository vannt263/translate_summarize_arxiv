    "a galaxy is a stellar system consisting of a massive gravitationally bound assembly of stars , an interstellar medium of gas and cosmic dust , etc .",
    "observations have shown that many ( mature spiral ) galaxies share a common structure with the _ visible _ matter distributed in a flat thin disk ( as in figure [ fig : galaxy ] ) , rotating about their center of mass in nearly circular orbits @xcite .",
    "apparently , this typical behavior of galaxies is similar to that of our solar system with planets orbiting around the sun in a flat planetary plane .",
    "spiral galaxies : ngc 3198 and ngc 4594also known as m 104 sombrero galaxy.,title=\"fig : \" ]   spiral galaxies : ngc 3198 and ngc 4594also known as m 104 sombrero galaxy.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for planets orbiting around the sun , kepler s laws of planetary motion ( obtained empirically ) can provide accurate description .",
    "yet it was isaac newton , in his `` philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica '' , who used mathematical expressions to show that kepler s laws are consequences of newton s laws of motion and universal law of gravitation @xcite .",
    "in addition , newton found that kepler s laws were only part of the story of how objects move in response to gravity . with his laws",
    "being discovered by analyzing the orbits of planets around the sun , kepler had no reason to believe that his laws would apply to other cases such as moons orbiting planets or comets orbiting the sun .",
    "but newton was able to derive more general rules that can explain the motion of objects throughout the universe , by analyzing his equations of gravity and motion .",
    "therefore , newton s laws of motion and gravity have become a crucial part of the foundation of modern astronomy , whereas kepler s laws can become misleading if not applied correctly with sufficient care to cases other than planets orbiting the sun .",
    "for example , kepler s third law , stating that more distant objects rotate around the center at slower average speeds , can not describe the typically observed _ flat _ orbital velocity that remains invariant for most part of a galaxy outside its central core @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference between a galaxy and the solar system is that the mass is apparently distributed across the entire galaxy whereas the solar system has its mass concentrated at the center in the sun .",
    "each planet in the solar system can be quite reasonably treated as a point mass moving in a spherically symmetric gravitational field stemming from a large central point mass .",
    "the spherical symmetry of gravitational field in the solar system greatly simplifies the mathematical analysis , because the gravitational potential at any position is basically determined by the distance from the center and the mass of the sun , with contributions from other planets negligible .",
    "actually , the treatment similar to that for the solar system can be directly extended to the situation of distributed mass system as long as it retains the spherical symmetry , except that now the equivalent mass at the center is not a constant but equals to the mass enclosed by the concentric spherical surface through that point of interest . according to newton",
    "s first and second theorems , if certain amount of mass is uniformly distributed in a spherical shell , this shell exerts no net ( gravitational ) force on any mass at any point inside it but attracts any mass outside it as if its mass is concentrated at the center @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the thin - disk galaxies do not possess such a simplification - enabling spherical symmetry .",
    "so , much more sophisticated mathematical treatments are needed to _ correctly _ apply newton s laws to the thin - disk galaxies .",
    "here in this work , we demonstrate an effective numerical method for computing either mass density distribution for a given orbital velocity profile or vice versa by solving the governing equations based on newton s laws for an axisymmetric thin - disk galaxy of finite size .",
    "we also quantitatively illustrate the possible misleading results due to incorrect application of kepler s laws to the same thin - disk galaxy .",
    "in other words , we show that the observed behavior of disk galaxies can be described and explained by application of newton s laws , but not by kepler s laws that may only be regarded as a special case derived from newton s laws for spherically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "because much of the mass of a galaxy resides in stars , we can in principle compute gravitational field of a large collection of stars by adding the point - mass fields of all the stars together for any spot of interest . for convenience of mathematical treatment , however",
    ", here we represent a galaxy by a continuum of axisymmetrically distributed mass in a circular disk of radius @xmath0 as shown in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "thus , in the present model we consider continuous mass density distribution instead of discrete mass points scattered throughout the disk .",
    "this kind of approximation is typically valid when the mass density in stars is viewed on a scale that is small compare to the size of the galaxy , but large compared to the mean distance between stars @xcite .",
    "physically , the stars in a galaxy must rotate about the galactic center to maintain the disk shape . without the centrifugal effect due to rotation",
    ", the stars would collapse into the galactic center as a consequence of the gravitational field .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume the galaxy is in an approximately steady state with the gravitational force and centrifugal force balancing each other , in view of the fact that most disk stars have completed a large number of revolutions @xcite .",
    "let s consider the force density on a test mass at @xmath1 generated by the gravitational attraction due to the summation ( or integration ) of a distribution of mass density @xmath2 at position described by the variables of integration @xmath3 . here",
    "the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath3 is @xmath5 and the vector projection between the two points is @xmath6 .",
    "thus in a steady state , the mechanical balance between the gravitational force ( due to the summation of mass in a series of concentric rings ) and centrifugal force at every test point ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) on the disk , according to newton s laws of motion and gravitation , can be written as an integration equation ( in terms of force per unit mass ) @xmath9 \\rho(\\hat{r } ) h \\hat{r } d\\hat{r } + a \\frac{v(r)^2}{r }   = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where all the variables are made dimensionless by measuring lengths ( e.g. , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) in units of the outermost galactic radius @xmath0 , disk mass density ( @xmath12 ) in units of @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting the total galactic mass , and velocities [ @xmath15 in units of the characteristic galactic rotational velocity @xmath16 ( as usually defined according to the problem of interest ) .",
    "the disk thickness @xmath11 is assumed to be constant and small in comparison with the galactic radius @xmath0 .",
    "the results are expected to be insensitive to the exact value of this ratio as long as it is small .",
    "there is no difference in terms of physical meaning between the notations @xmath4 and @xmath3 ; but mathematically the former denotes the independent variables in the integral equation ( for @xmath8 ) whereas the latter the variables of integration .",
    "the gravitational force represented as the summation of a series of concentric rings is described by the first term ( double integral ) while the centrifugal forces are described by the second term in ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) .",
    "our process of nondimensionalization of the force - balance equation yields a dimensionless parameter , which we call the `` galactic rotation number '' @xmath17 , as given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 [ m@xmath21/(kg s@xmath22 ) ] ) denotes the gravitational constant , @xmath0 is the outermost galactic radius , and @xmath16 is the characteristic velocity ( which may be equated here to the maximum asymptotic rotational velocity of a disk galaxy ) .",
    "this galactic rotation number @xmath17 simply displays the ratio of centrifugal forces to gravitational forces . for typical galactic values of @xmath0 , @xmath16 , and @xmath14",
    "we obtain @xmath23 as will be shown in detail later .",
    "when solving for the mass density @xmath24 with @xmath25 given , we need to impose an overall constraint such that the total mass of the galaxy @xmath14 is constant , namely , @xmath26 this constraint due to the conservation of mass can actually be used to determine the value of galatic rotation number @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that the integral with respect to @xmath27 in ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) can be written as @xcite ( pp .",

    "conversely , these equations can also be used to determine the orbital velocity @xmath25 if the mass density distribution @xmath24 is known .",
    "this is a well - defined mathematical problem completely deducible from the available input data .",
    "because our governing equations are derived according to newton s laws , they must be applicable to the solar system . as an example for @xmath34 ( namely , the dirac delta function in two - dimensional polar coordinates ) , ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) or ( [ eq : force - balance ] ) would yield @xmath35 which is exactly the familiar formula for so - called keplerian velocity based on kepler s third law of planetary motion @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimensional orbital velocity",
    ", @xmath14 is basically the mass of the sun , and @xmath38 the dimensional distance from the sun .    for a galaxy with mass distribution that is not spherically symmetric",
    ", simple closed - form analytical solutions may not be tractable . yet",
    "accurate numerical solutions can be computed with appropriately implemented computational techniques as detailed in appendix a. what it amounts to is nothing more than solving a linear algebra matrix problem using a well - established matrix solver .",
    "the measurements of galactic rotational velocity profiles ( also known as `` rotation curves '' ) of mature spiral galaxies reveal that the rotation velocity typically rises linearly from the galactic center ( as if the local mass were in rigid body rotation ) in a relatively small core , and then with the slope decreasing continuously in a narrow transition zone it reaches an approximately constant ( flat ) velocity extending to the galactic periphery @xcite .",
    "these essential features may be mathematically idealized as can be almost arbitrary .",

    "the parameter @xmath33 can be used to describe various radii of the `` cores '' of different galaxies .",
    "close to the galactic center , namely when @xmath40 is small , we have @xmath41 , describing a linearly rising rotation velocity , by virtue of the taylor expansion of @xmath42 . figure  [ fig : rotationcurve ] shows typical galactic rotation curves described by ( [ eq : rotationcurves ] ) .        with @xmath25 given by ( [ eq : rotationcurves ] )",
    ", the mass density distribution @xmath24 and the value of @xmath17 can be determined by computing solution to ( [ eq : force - balance - residual ] ) and ( [ eq : mass - conservation - residual ] ) . to compute numerical solutions ,",
    "the value of disk thickness @xmath11 must be provided ; we assume @xmath43 ( based on the measurements for the milky way galaxy ) . by using @xmath44 nonuniformly distributed nodes we found the obtained curves of @xmath24 become reasonably smooth and the values of galactic rotation number @xmath17 are discretization - independent .    shown in figure  [ fig : rho - r ] are the computed mass density distributions @xmath24 that satisfy the galactic rotation curves in figure  [ fig : rotationcurve ] .",
    "it is at the galactic center where mass attains the highest density .",
    "away from the galactic center , the mass density decreases rapidly ( with a slope becoming steeper for a tigher galactic core indicated by smaller @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , beyond @xmath33 , the mass density decreases rather gradually towards the galactic periphery until reaching the galactic edge where it takes a sharp drop .",
    "noteworthy here is that the computed values of galactic rotation number @xmath17 are within a small range around @xmath45 despite an order - of - magnitude variation of the galactic core radius @xmath33 .        as apparent in figure",
    "[ fig : rho - r ] , the computed @xmath46 decreases almost linearly with @xmath7 except for @xmath47 ( within the central galactic core ) and @xmath48 ( near the galactic edge ) .",
    "this general feature is quite similar to the measured brightness distributions ( in typical spiral galaxies ) that are commonly fitted in an exponential form with regions of central core and outer edge truncated . for the case of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , a least - square fit of our computed @xmath46 versus @xmath7 for @xmath51 yields @xmath52",
    "this actually corresponds to an exponential function @xmath53 with @xmath54 which is known not to be able to generate the observed flat rotation curves @xcite .",
    "thus the much more rapid decrease of @xmath46 in the small intervals [ 0 , 0.1 ) and ( 0.9 , 1 ] must play important roles in compensating the deficiencies of the simple exponential mass density distribution for matching the commonly observed ( flat ) rotation curves .",
    "if we assume the mass density follows roughly the exponential distribution @xmath53 , we would have the cumulative mass from the galactic center given by @xmath55 \\ , .\\ ] ] at @xmath56 , this yields a value of @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , indicating the exponential mass density distribution is likely to describe about @xmath60 of the mass in a disk galaxy .",
    "another @xmath61 of the galactic mass seems to reside in the galactic core which may not follow the same exponential distribution ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho - r ] ) .    from the knowledge of @xmath16 and @xmath0 from measured rotation curves",
    ", we can determine the value of @xmath14 based on computed value of the galactic rotation number @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : parameter - a ] ) ) as @xmath62 because our computed @xmath17 varies little from @xmath45 for various @xmath33 , ( [ eq : m_g ] ) suggests a general relationship of @xmath63 as what bosma @xcite found from evaluating mass versus size in a large number of observed disk galaxies . in view of the fact that the values of @xmath16 are typically around @xmath64 ( km / s )",
    ", we then believe that the disk size of galaxies @xmath0 must be finite in order to keep the total mass of a galaxy @xmath14 from becoming infinity . suggesting finite disk size of galaxies",
    "does not necessarily mean that the mass density becomes zero outside the disk edge .",
    "we believe that the mass density beyond the galactic edge approaches the inter - galactic level of value and is roughly spherically symmetric , which leads to inconsequential gravitational effect on rotation dynamics in the disk part .",
    "if we take the rotation curve with @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : rotationcurve ] as that of the milky way , we have the galactic rotation number @xmath65 only for the purpose of convenient illustration .",
    "the value of @xmath65 ( with a variation of @xmath66 ) is actually valid for a wide range of @xmath33 values as shown in figure  [ fig : rho - r ] . ] .",
    "then , from measured milky way values @xmath67 ( m / s ) and @xmath68 ( light - years ) @xmath69 ( m ) , ( [ eq : m_g ] ) yields @xmath70 this value is in very good agreement with the milky way star counts of 100 billion @xcite , further including additional dust , grains , lumps , gases and plasma in all galaxies .    with the given values of @xmath14 and @xmath0 , we can estimate the computed ` radial scale ' @xmath71 ( kpc ) @xmath72 ( m ) and the exponential disk central ( surface ) mass density @xmath73 ( solar - mass / pc@xmath22 ) based on ( [ eq : log_rho ] ) for the milky way galaxy .",
    "( here , @xmath74 ( pc ) @xmath75 ( m ) and @xmath74 ( solar mass ) @xmath76 ( kg ) . )",
    "compared with the results from fitting the brightness measurement data , e.g. , the radial scale of @xmath77 ( kpc ) and exponential disk central brightness of @xmath78 ( solar - luminosity / pc@xmath22 ) @xcite , our computational results indicate either generally dimmer stars ( than the sun ) or considerable amounts of cold gas exist throughout the milky way with the total mass density decreasing at slower rate than that of the brightness ( i.e. , luminosity density ) .",
    "another example is the galaxy ngc 3198 , which has a ( nearly idealized , often cited ) rotation curve with @xmath79 ( m / s ) , @xmath80 ( kpc ) @xmath81 ( m ) , and @xmath82 . again with @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath83 ( kg ) @xmath84 ( solar - mass ) . as with the milky way , we can also predict the radial scale and exponential central mass density for ngc 3198 as @xmath85 ( kpc ) and @xmath86 ( solar - mass / pc@xmath22 ) , respectively ( based on @xmath58 and @xmath59 from ( [ eq : log_rho ] ) .",
    "compared with the radial luminosity profile ( which suggested an exponential disk with a radial scale of @xmath87 ( kpc ) and central brightness @xmath88 ( solar - luminosity / pc@xmath22 ) based on a total luminosity of @xmath89 ( solar - luminosity ) @xcite , our predicted mass density appears to decrease much more slowly with stars ( or mass objects ) generally dimmer than the sun .",
    "hence , the results computed here , as if they were obtained by newton applying his laws of motion and gravitation to solve the governing equations ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) and ( [ eq : mass - conservation ] ) , seem to be reasonably consistent with the observational measurements . in other words ,",
    "the rotating thin - disk galaxies through the eyes of newton are nothing more than massive gravitationally bound assemblies of objects governed by his same laws for the planet s motion in the solar system albeit more sophiscated mathematical treatments are needed to obtain the correct description than those with the planets in the solar system .",
    "in the literature , many authors @xcite tend to simply apply keplerian dynamics ( which was derived from gravitational field generated by a spherically symmetric distribution of mass ) when analyzing the rotation behavior of thin - disk galaxies .",
    "for example , volders @xcite demonstrated that spiral galaxy m33 does not spin as expected according to keplerian dynamics  a result which was later extended to many other spiral galaxies @xcite .    strictly speaking , a keplerian potential ( due to a point mass @xmath90 as that for the solar system ) is expressed as @xmath91 for a distributed mass with spherical symmetry",
    ", the generalized form of keplerian potential becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the amount of mass enclosed by the concentric spherical surface of radius @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "although ( [ eq : keplerian - like - potential ] ) comes from the assumption of spherical symmetry , it has often been used to determine the mass distribution and the total mass of a ( disk ) galaxy from a measured rotation curve , with @xmath93 denoting the mass interior to radius @xmath7 from the galactic center .",
    "for example , in the recent versions of textbooks by bennett _",
    "@xcite , sparke and gallagher @xcite , and keel @xcite , the value of @xmath93 ( also denoted as @xmath94 or @xmath95 ) in a disk galaxy is simply determined from a known rotation curve @xmath25 by @xmath96 which has basically the same mathematical form as ( [ eq : keplerian ] ) .    according to ( [ eq : mass - from - keplerian ] )",
    ", we would have an equation based on keplerian dynamics for force balance as @xmath97 instead of ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) . here",
    ", the difference in mathematical forms between ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) and ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) should be quite clear .",
    "but whether there are much of practical differences between the two may not be obvious . for example , authors like sparke and gallagher @xcite and keel @xcite attempted to justify their usages of keplerian formula for rotating thin disk galaxies by stating that the result due to keplerian formula does not differ more than @xmath98 from the actual result , without showing a quantitative comparison .",
    "therefore , we would like to examine a few comparative examples to see whether keplerian dynamics ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) can be practically used as a close approximation to newtonian dynamics ( [ eq : force - balance0 ] ) for disk galaxies .    for the orbital velocity @xmath25 given by ( [ eq : rotationcurves ] ) , an analytical solution to ( [ eq : force - balance ?",
    "] ) for @xmath24 can be obtained as @xmath99 \\ , .\\ ] ] it is not difficult to prove that @xmath100 as @xmath101 , as in sharp contrast to that obtained according to newton s laws shown in figure  [ fig : rho - r ] . for @xmath102 ( i.e. , outside the galactic core ) ,",
    "( [ eq : solution - to - force - balance ? ] describes @xmath103 , as expected for the part where @xmath25 is flat ( constant ) such that the first term in ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , many astronomers often consider the flat rotation curves , i.e. , @xmath104 , to indicate that the mass of a disk galaxy should continue to increase linearly well beyond its bright central region because @xmath105 @xcite .    to satisfy ( [ eq : mass - conservation ] ) , the value of @xmath17 in ( [ eq : solution - to - force - balance ? ] ) is given by @xmath106 when @xmath33 is small , e.g. , @xmath49 , we have @xmath107 , e.g. , @xmath108 ; therefore , @xmath109 according to ( [ eq : solution - of - a ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the result based on formulas for disk galaxies ( which predicts @xmath65 ) . if @xmath110 were used in ( [ eq : m_g ] ) , we would have the total mass in milky way equal to @xmath111 ( solar - mass)much more than that given by ( [ eq : m_g - value ] ) and the milky way star counts .    as a comparison , the distribution of @xmath24 shown in figure  [ fig : rho - r ] for @xmath49 and that given by ( [ eq : solution - to - force - balance ? ] ) with @xmath110 are shown in figure  [ fig : rho - comparison ] .",
    "now , the differences between the two are obvious : the keplerian mass density behaves totally differently in the galactic core with @xmath100 whereas that numerically obtained in",
    "  3 has @xmath24 monotonically decreasing with @xmath7 from its maximum value at galactic center to periphery .",
    "outside the galactic core , the keplerian mass density shows much slower decay ( @xmath112 ) toward the galactic periphery whereas that obtained numerically in   3 seems to be approximately exponential .",
    "therefore , the mass density distribution determined based on keplerian dynamics ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) can not be a good approximation to the actual @xmath24 obtained numerically in   3 with newton s laws strictly applied .        on the other hand , if the mass density @xmath24 is known as obtained in   3 for the case of @xmath49 with @xmath50",
    ", we can compute the corresponding @xmath25 from ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) . figure  [ fig : v - comparison ] shows that the @xmath25 from ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) clearly differs from that of ( [ eq : rotationcurves ] ) , with rotation velocity decreasing with the radial distance @xmath7 toward the galactic periphery as expected from kepler s third law . again , this suggests that ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) according to the keplerian dynamics can not be a good approximation to the actual galactic dynamics .        as demonstrated in   3 , we believe that newton s laws of motion and gravitation can adequately describe the dynamical behavior of ( disk ) galaxies , with appropriate mathematical treatments .",
    "kepler s laws should not be regarded as the same as newton s laws .",
    "newton s laws can explain kepler s laws for the planets in the solar system ; but kepler s laws can not be extended to the galactic dynamics like newton s laws , even in an approximation sense as shown in figure  [ fig : rho - comparison ] and figure  [ fig : v - comparison ] .",
    "by strictly applying newton s laws , the present computational model can yield mass distributions from the observed galactic rotation curves , as apparently quite consistent with the observed near exponential brightness distributions .",
    "thus through the eyes of newton , galaxies are nothing more than graviationally bound assemblies of massive objects that are governed by his same laws for the planet s motion in the solar system .",
    "although newton s laws and kepler s laws seem to yield the same results when they are applied to the planets in the solar system , they can lead to quite different results when describing the stellar dynamics in disk galaxies ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho - comparison ] and figure  [ fig : v - comparison ] ) .",
    "if not careful , simply extending kepler s laws to the disk galaxies with subtensively distributed mass can suggest misleading conclusions .    as demonstrated in ",
    "4 , substituting the computed mass density distribution @xmath24 based on newtonian dynamics into the keplerian force - balance equation ( [ eq : force - balance ? ] ) would yield a rotation curve with orbital velocity decreasing toward galactic periphery ( see figure  [ fig : v - comparison ] ) .",
    "this had led many authors to believe that the visible mass in a galaxy can not explain the observed flat rotation curve @xcite .",
    "therefore , some authors have speculated that some kind of invisible matter called dark matter must exist in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "other authors believed modification of newton s laws to be needed @xcite .",
    "the fundamental problem here is that astronomers tend to determine the ` visible ' mass in a galaxy from the measured brightness based on an over - simplified _ mass - to - light ratio _ @xcite .",
    "when the mass distribution so estimated did not generate the observed _ flat _ rotation curve , especially when the keplerian dynamics was used for another over - simplification , it is often referred to as the ` galactic rotation problem ' suggesting that there is a discrepancy between the observed rotation speed of matter in the disk and the predictions of newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "but we believe that newtonian dynamics can adequately explain the stellar dynamics in disk galaxies when applied correctly ; neither the introduction of dark matter nor modification of newtonian dynamics is needed for explaining the observed rotation curve @xcite .",
    "hence , the rotating disk galaxies described with our model must be that seen through the eyes of newton .",
