    "as shown in section iii.a , the _",

    "@xmath26 is calculated as weight - averaged values of bulk co and ni@xcite .",
    "fig.[f6 ] summarizes the strain - induced pma before and after annealing .",
    "it is clear that the strain from pt and ru seed result always in a negative contribution to the pma of [ co / ni ] , which may in both cases counteract with the increase in pma from improved film quality after annealing ( see the narrower peak of [ co / ni ] with larger intensity after annealing in fig.[f1 ] and decreased fwhm in fig.[f2 ] ) and results in little net @xmath16 improvement ( see fig.[f5](d ) ) .",
    "similarly observed in fig.[f5](d ) , as - deposited [ co / ni ] on ta seed shows low @xmath16 due to the negative strain - induced pma , even though it has the required texture ( see fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "after annealing , strain - induced pma contributes positively to total @xmath16 of [ co / ni ] on ta seed . for [ co / ni ] on nicr seed , the strain after annealing promotes the increase in total @xmath16 . from this discussion , it is clear that the seed layer providing in - plane tensile strain to [ co / ni ] is desired for pma increase .",
    "however , only the strain contribution can not explain the large pma that is observed after annealing on nicr .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig.[f5](b ) , there is also a large increase in @xmath18 for [ co / ni ] on nicr and ta samples , while their @xmath13 reduce dramatically , which can not be explained by the previous strain - induced pma change .    ) and strain - induced anisotropy energy ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "we have performed an advanced compositional analysis of the [ co / ni ] after annealing .",
    "fig.[f7 ] shows the tof - sims depth profiles of cr , pt , ru and ta as - deposited and after 400@xmath0c annealing .",
    "the ni signal is provided to indicate position of the [ co / ni ] multilayers . in the case of the nicr seed ,",
    "cr is found throughout the whole layer of [ co / ni ] after 400@xmath0c annealing , since its signal appears at the same depth ( sputter time ) as ni .",
    "that means cr diffuses heavily in the [ co / ni ] .",
    "the same phenomenon is observed for pt seed , but the intensity of the signal from diffused pt is low when compared to the pt signal in the seed layer part , indicating that the diffusion amount of pt is limited . for ru shown in fig.[f7](c ) , the interface between the ru seed and [ co / ni ] remains sharp after annealing . on the contrary ,",
    "the less steep increase in ta signal suggest intermixing between [ co / ni ] and ta after annealing at the interface , but does not suggest ta diffusion in the bulk of the [ co / ni ] films .        to quantitatively study the diffusion of the seed in the [ co / ni ] , xps measurements are conducted and the apparent atomic concentration of co , ni and seed layer element in each sample with different annealing conditions are shown in fig.[f8 ] .",
    "note that the higher apparent concentration of co when compared to ni for the as - deposited sample is due to the surface sensitivity of the xps technique as explained in the figure caption .",
    "it is clear that cr diffuses the most among the four seed layers .",
    "the presence of cr in [ co / ni ] may also lead to the shift of the [ co / ni ] peak towards the nicr peak in the xrd pattern shown in fig.[f1](a ) , probably resulting in the formation of co - ni - cr alloy .",
    "furthermore , the observed change in magnetic properties can likely be attributed to the formation of the co - ni - cr alloy@xcite .",
    "indeed , the uniform diffusion of cr was reported to cause @xmath18 increase in co - ni film with in - plane anisotropy@xcite . and",
    "cr can be coupled antiferromagnetically with its co and ni hosts causing the @xmath13 drop@xcite and higher pma .",
    "less diffusion is observed for the pt seed , in agreement with the peak shift toward pt seed ( fig.1(b ) ) and for the lower increase in pma as well , since the [ co / pt ] system , alloys or multilayers , is a well - known pma system and so a change in pma due to pt atoms in the [ co / ni ] matrix is not necessarily detrimental@xcite . on the contrary , no significant diffusion of ru into [ co / ni ] layers has been observed in fig.[f8](c ) , so no impact on pma is to be expected .",
    "finally , a large increase in pma has been observed after annealing whereas the diffusion is limited for ta seed .",
    "possibly , the improvement of crystal structure and the formation of a co - ni - ta alloy at the interface of ta seed and [ co / ni ] part happens at higher temperature , which gives rise to pma and @xmath13 loss@xcite .",
    "apart from the @xmath13 and pma change , the diffusion of the seed material into the [ co / ni ] might also impact the magneto - elastic coefficients to be taken into account when calculating the strain - induced pma ( see section iii.c.1 ) .",
    "this impact is however not straightforward and requires further study .",
    ", are omitted in the figure . ]      earlier studies reported on dopants that increase the damping when incorporated into a ferromagnetic film@xcite . in our case , it is natural to expect that an impact from the diffused seed layer element will be exerted on the dynamic magnetic properties of [ co / ni ] .",
    "therefore , the gilbert damping constant ( @xmath15 ) of each sample with different annealing conditions was derived from vna - fmr for study .",
    "fig.[f9 ] compares the permeabilities of the [ co / ni ] films as - deposited and after 400@xmath0c annealing when the fmr frequency is set to 15 ghz by a proper choice of the applied field .",
    "the broadening of the linewidths after annealing reflects the increase in damping for all cases , with the noticeable exception of ru .",
    "the nicr resonance was too broadened to be resolved after 400@xmath0c annealing , reflecting a very high damping or a very large inhomogenity in the magnetic properties .",
    "linear fits of the fmr linewidth versus fmr frequency were conducted ( not shown ) to extract the damping parameters , which are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "it should be noticed that in our vna - fmr measurement , the two - magnon contributions to the linewidth and hence its impact on damping derivation can be excluded due to the perpendicular geometry in the measurement@xcite . and",
    "the contribution of spin - pumping within the seed layer to the linewidth in our cases is always expected to be within the error bar@xcite .",
    "the lowest damping in the as - deposited [ co / ni ] films were obtained on ta and nicr seed , i.e. in the in - plane magnetized samples .",
    "the highest damping was found on pt seed , a fact that is generally interpreted as arising from the large spin - orbit coupling of pt . and the damping values increase with post annealing in [ co / ni ] on all seed layers except ru . though the damping of [ co / ni ] is larger than cofeb / mgo@xcite , it is equal to or smaller than [ co / pt ] and [ co / pd]@xcite , which makes it of interest to use as free layer material with high thermal stability in high density stt - mram applications@xcite .",

    "there is a clear correlation between the damping and the concentration of the seed element in the [ co / ni ] system .",
    "the absence of evolution of the damping upon annealing for [ co / ni ] on ru can thus be explained by the non - diffusive character of the ru seed . in the case of the nicr seed ,",
    "the damping is the largest after annealing .",
    "a similar trend was observed before on au seeds and attributed to the formation of superparamagnetic islands in thin [ co / ni ] multilayers@xcite . however , since we observe for the same [ co / ni ] system no @xmath13 loss and no @xmath18 increase on ru and pt , and since the pma on nicr after anneal is the highest , the formation of super paramagnetic islands can not be the reason to explain the magnetic behavior .",
    "it is more likely that the increased damping comes from the formation of a textured co - ni - cr alloy with high pma and high damping , as mentioned in section iii.c.2 .",
    "finally , in the case of pt and ta seeds , the damping on the pt seed is higher than on the ta seed for the same concentration .",
    "that is attributed to the spin - orbit coupling for pt dopants being substantially higher than for ta . in conclusion , it is clear that the seed diffusion can not be ignored when studying the impact of annealing on the structural and magnetic properties of [ co / ni ] .     and ( b ) @xmath28 as a function of seed element concentration in [ co / ni ] .",

    "the damping property of [ co / ni ] on different seed layers evolves similarly as pma with post - annealing .",
    "the explanation for these phenomena is the diffusion property of seed layer materials .",
    "high pma and very large damping is obtained on nicr seed because of the dramatic diffusion of cr and the formation of co - ni - cr alloy . though non - diffusive ru seed results in low damping , low pma as - deposited and after annealing is obtained .",
    "pt seed can provide good pma , but its large spin - orbit coupling exerted from the interface with [ co / ni ] and diffused part increases damping , especially after annealing .",

    "<S> [ co / ni ] multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) have been researched and applied in various spintronic applications . typically the seed layer material is studied to provide the desired face - centered cubic ( _ fcc _ ) texture to the [ co / ni ] to obtain pma . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of [ co / ni ] in back - end - of - line ( beol ) processes also requires the pma to survive post - annealing . in this paper , the impact of nicr , pt , ru , and ta seed layers on the structural and magnetic properties of [ co(0.3 nm)/ni(0.6 nm ) ] multilayers is investigated before and after annealing . </S>",
    "<S> the multilayers were deposited _ in - situ _ on different seeds via physical vapor deposition at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the as - deposited [ co / ni ] films show the required _ </S>",
    "<S> fcc_(111 ) texture on all seeds , but pma is only observed on pt and ru . </S>",
    "<S> in - plane magnetic anisotropy ( i m a ) is obtained on nicr and ta seeds , which is attributed to strain - induced pma loss . </S>",
    "<S> pma is maintained on all seeds after post - annealing up to 400@xmath0c . </S>",
    "<S> the largest effective perpendicular anisotropy energy ( @xmath1j / m@xmath2 ) after annealing is achieved on nicr seed . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of pma upon annealing can not be explained by further crystallization during annealing or strain - induced pma , nor can the observed magnetization loss and the increased damping after annealing . </S>",
    "<S> here we identify the diffusion of the non - magnetic materials from the seed into [ co / ni ] as the major driver of the changes in the magnetic properties . by selecting the seed and post - annealing temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the [ co / ni ] can be tuned in a broad range for both pma and damping . </S>"
