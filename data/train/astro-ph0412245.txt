    "a revised outer gap model ( zhang et al . 2004 ) takes into account the effect of the inclination angle @xmath7 between the magnetic axis and the rotational axis , which can determine the gap size of the outer gap .",

    "the high energy radiation of mature pulsars can come both from the pulsar magnetosphere inside light cylinder , and from the pulsar wind nebula outside light cylinder .",
    "we present the @xmath0-ray emission properties of pulsars using the outer gap models originally proposed by cheng et al .",
    "( 1986a , b ) . based on the model ,",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) have developed a self - consistent mechanism to describe the high energy radiation from spin - powered pulsars . in their model , relativistic charged particles from a thick outer magnetospheric accelerator ( outer gap ) radiate through the synchro - curvature radiation mechanism ( cheng & zhang 1996 ) rather than the synchrotron and curvature mechanisms in general , producing non - thermal photons from the primary @xmath11 pairs along the curved magnetic field lines in the outer gap .",
    "the characteristic emission energy of high energy photons emitted from the outer gap is given by ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) e_,c 510 ^ 7 f^3/2b_12 ^ 3/4 p^-7/4(rr_l)^-13/8  ev , where @xmath12 is the rotation period , @xmath13 is the dipolar magnetic field in units of @xmath14 g , @xmath15 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath16 is the distance to the neutron star , and @xmath17 is the fractional size of the outer gap . the @xmath0-ray spectrum drops exponentially beyond the energy @xmath18 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 , defined as the the ratio between the mean vertical separation of the outer gap boundaries in the plane of the rotation axis and the magnetic axis to the light cylinder radius , is limited by the pair production between the soft thermal x - rays from the neutron star surface and the high energy @xmath0-ray photons emitted from the outer gap region , and can be approximated as @xmath19 .",
    "the size of @xmath17 in turn determines the total @xmath0-ray luminosity of the pulsar , which is given by ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) l_f^3 l_sd , where @xmath20 is the pulsar spin down power .",
    "however , the estimation of gap size @xmath17 by zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) does not include the effect of inclination angle and their model can produce very few pulsars with age @xmath1 yrs .",
    "zhang et al . (",
    "2004 ) have studied the properties of the outer gap by including the effect of the inclination angle .",
    "also , instead of taking half of the light cylinder as the representation of the outer gap , they have calculated the average outer gap size and use it as the representation of the outer gap .",
    "this is very important for a statistical study .",
    "cheng et al ( 2004a ) show that in monte carlo simulations even if the inclination angle of pulsars is randomly selected from a uniform distribution , the simulated @xmath0-ray pulsars detected by egret in the galactic plane are younger and tend to have a larger inclination angle . on the other hand , @xmath0-ray",
    "pulsars detected by egret at higher latitudes are older and have a smaller inclination angle . in other words , even if the seed distribution has a uniform distribution , a non - uniform distribution can be generated by the @xmath0-ray selection effects .",
    "in this paper , we intend to use monte carlo methods to study gev and tev @xmath0-ray properties of pulsars , so we adopt the model of zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to determine the size of the outer gap . assuming that the representative region of the outer gap is the average distance to the gap",
    ", the mean fractional size of the outer gap can be approximated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath23 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 roughly decreases by a factor 3 from large inclination angles to smaller angles ( zhang et al .",
    "these @xmath0-rays from the pulsar magnetosphere will contribute to the pulsed gev photons in @xmath0-ray pulsars detected by egret .    in general the differential energy spectrum of @xmath0-rays for each pulsar",
    "is different . in principle",
    "we can calculate it if the pulsar parameters are specified .",
    "however , it is very difficult to do so in a monte carlo simulation , in which we need to deal with over ten million pulsars .",
    "egret has detected six @xmath0-ray pulsars and their energy spectra from 100 mev to a few gev are all very close to @xmath25 ( hartman et al .",
    "for thin outer gap pulsars , it has been shown that the energy spectrum is proportional to @xmath26 ( cheng , ho and ruderman 1986b ; cheng and ding 1994 ) . for simplicity in the monte carlo simulation , we will approximate the expected energy differential @xmath0-ray flux of the pulsar as f(e _ ) , where @xmath27 is the distance of the pulsar , and @xmath28 is the the solid angle of @xmath0-ray beaming .",
    "the value of @xmath28 generally varies with different pulsars . for simplicity , we assume a constant beaming solid angle @xmath29  sr in all our analyses . in order to compare our model results with observations , we calculate the expected integral egret flux of our model @xmath0-ray pulsars using the formula s_(e_100mev)=_100 mev^e_maxf(e_)de _ , where @xmath30 is the maximum @xmath0-ray energy detected by egret , chosen to be 50  gev .    here",
    ", we have ignored the @xmath0-ray contribution from the polar cap , which could be important for unidentified egret sources ( gonthier et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the phase - resolved egret data of the crab pulsar ( cheng , ruderman and zhang 2000 ) , geminga ( zhang and cheng 2001 ) and the vela pulsar ( romani 1996 ) can be explained very well by the outer gap model and it appears that polar cap emission is unimportant . most recently , muslimov & harding(2004 ) have suggested that the slot gap model could be able to explain the phase - resolved data as well .",
    "since the distributions of simulated @xmath0-ray pulsars are model dependent , in this paper we will ignore the contribution of @xmath0-rays from the polar cap for simplicity .",
    "previous models of the pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , kennel & coroniti 1984 ; chevalier 2000 ) mainly concentrate on the bright nebulae produced by interactions between young pulsar wind particles and the supernova remnant ( snr ) . on the other hand , while there are no snr surrounding the mature pulsars , they remain active enough to produce the relatively faint , compact synchrotron nebulae through interactions between the relativistic wind particles and the interstellar medium . in this work ,",
    "we use the one - zone model to describe high energy radiation from pulsar wind nebulae ( chevalier 2000 ) . in the model ,",
    "the relativistic electrons in the shock waves emit x - rays through synchrotron radiation .",
    "this model can well explain the x - ray luminosity and spectral properties of pulsar wind nebulae ( cheng et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "mature pulsars move at a high proper velocity after their birth , and can form a bow shock structure to produce synchrotron wind nebulae when the pulsar proper motion velocity is larger than the sound speed in the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the characteristic size of the shock wave produced by interactions between the pulsar wind particles and the ism is referred to as the termination radius , @xmath31 , and can be derived from r_s = ( l_sd/2v_p^2 c)^1/2~10 ^ 16l_sd , 34 ^ 1/2n^-1/2v_p,350 ^ -1  cm , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the number density of the ism , @xmath34 is the proton rest mass , @xmath35 is the pulsar velocity in units of 350 km s@xmath36 ( cf . ",
    "5.2 ) , and @xmath37 is the spin down power of the pulsar in units of @xmath38 erg s@xmath36 .",
    "we have assumed the pulsar wind can carry away most of the pulsar spin - down power ( @xmath39 ) and deposit in the shock waves when the wind interacts with the interstellar medium . in general , the energy in the shock waves is stored in the magnetic field , the energetic protons ( ions ) and electrons . however , the fractional energy density of the magnetic field @xmath40 is low ( typically , @xmath41 , kennel & coroniti 1984 ) , then by assuming equipartition of energy between protons and electrons , we obtain @xmath42 . for a given @xmath40 , the magnetic field at the termination radius is estimated as @xmath43 . at the shock front , the electron energy distribution is @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 \\epsilon_e \\gamma_w$ ] , and @xmath47 is the lorentz factor of the pulsar wind particles .",
    "we derive the value of @xmath48 by two methods .",
    "first , an estimate for @xmath48 can be obtained by equating the synchrotron cooling timescale to the electron acceleration timescale .",
    "the former timescale is given by @xmath49 , and the latter timescale is given by @xmath50 , leading to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the thompson cross section , and @xmath53 denotes @xmath54 .",
    "second , we can estimate @xmath48 by equating the acceleration timescale and diffusion timescale of electrons .",
    "the electron diffusion time in the termination radius can be estimated as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the larmor radius .",
    "this gives a maximum lorentz factor of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 cm .",
    "we will assume _ max = min(_max,1 , _",
    "max,2 ) in the following discussion .",
    "the lorentz factor of wind particles can not be too small , the production of the synchrotron nebulae requiring , for example , @xmath59 .",
    "theoretical constraints on @xmath47 are still difficult to determine at present . in this paper , we use the arguments of ruderman ( 1981 ) and arons ( 1983 ) that large fluxes of protons ( ions ) can be extracted from neutron stars and can be accelerated in the parallel electric field in the magnetosphere .",
    "we also assume that the initial poynting flux can be converted into thermal and kinetic energy of the particles well within the termination radius , and that the lorentz factors of electrons and protons are the same . for young pulsars like the crab pulsar and the vela pulsar , a large number of electrons and positrons can be produced in the outer magnetosphere ( cheng , ruderman & ho 1986b ) and",
    "hence electrons / positrons are the main energy carriers in the pulsar wind . however , for mature pulsars with age @xmath60 years , the outer gap can not produce too many pairs ( zhang & cheng 1997 )",
    ". the pair creation will be mainly at the polar cap , however , the ratio between electron number and proton number is @xmath61 , in particular for the space - charge - limited flow situation ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ; cheng & ruderman 1980 ) . since we will show that the main contributors of tev @xmath0-ray sources are mature pulsars",
    ", so we shall assume that protons are the main energy carriers of the pulsar wind .",
    "we want to point out that this assumption does not conflict with the equipartition assumption in the shock waves because pulsar wind energy will be redistributed when the wind interacts with the interstellar medium in the shock waves .    the protons can then carry away most of the spin down power in this scenario ( coroniti 1990 ) .",
    "thus , we can derive the spin down power as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the outflow current from the surface .",
    "this outflow current should be of the same order as the goldreich - julian current ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) which is given as @xmath64 .",
    "for mature pulsars with @xmath65 , we derive a typical value of @xmath66 .",
    "the critical synchrotron frequency of relativistic electrons with a lorentz factor @xmath0 is @xmath67 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation properties from the pulsar wind nebulae depend on two characteristic frequencies : @xmath68 , radiated by the electrons with lorentz factor @xmath69 , and the cooling frequency , @xmath70 , given as @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath72 is the characteristic timescale of the nebula estimated from the flow timescale in a characteristic radiation region .",
    "if we define a characteristic time scale @xmath73  s , and @xmath74 g , then the cooling frequency @xmath75  hz .",
    "this corresponds to a characteristic cooling lorentz factor @xmath76 , which is significantly larger than @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we can derive the luminosity and spectral properties of synchrotron radiation from the pulsar wind nebulae . when @xmath77 , it can be described as a non - thermal spectrum with a power law photon index @xmath78 , and a synchrotron radiation luminosity estimated by ( also see chevalier 2000 ; cheng et al .",
    "2004b ) l_syn ( ) _ e^p-1 _ b^(p+1)/4 + v_p^(p+1)/2_w^p-2 t_0 l_sd^(3-p)/2 .",
    "this case is called the slow cooling regime . on the other hand in the fast cooling regime",
    "when @xmath79 , the emission spectrum will steepen because of the cooling of relativistic electrons , the photon index @xmath80 , and the luminosity is l_syn()(p-2p-1)^p-1(em_e c)^(p-2)/2(nm_p)^(p-2)/4 _",
    "e^p-1 + _ b^(p-2)/4 _ w^p-2",
    "the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the pulsar wind nebulae can well contribute to non - thermal radio to x - ray emissions .",
    "at the same time , the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the same relativistic electrons on the ambient photon fields results in the production of the very high energy tev photons observed ( de jager & harding 1992 ; atoyan &  aharonian 1996 ; aharonian , atoyan &  kifune 1997 ) . in this section , we will discuss two cases of the ics processes of two different types of seed photons , namely , background and synchrotron photons .",
    "we can see that the inverse compton luminosity is sensitively dependent on the properties of the seed photons .",
    "the relative magnitude between the emission from synchrotron and ics processes depends on the magnetic field @xmath9 and the photon field density @xmath81 .",
    "the magnetic field in the interstellar medium is typically within the range @xmath82  g. synchrotron x - ray photons and @xmath0-ray photons from ics have been shown to be produced in regions of different magnetic fields ( aharonian et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume for simplicity that the x - rays and @xmath0-rays come from the same region with a magnetic field @xmath74  g.    the photon energy density surrounding the pulsars can be attributed to several origins : first , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation contributes a constant energy density @xmath83 , second , the diffuse galactic dust far - infrared ( fir ) and star light near - infrared and optical background ( sl ) , and third , possible radiation fields of local origin .",
    "the density of the galactic background field varies from site to site , with an average values @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( mathis , metzger & panagia 1983 ) .",
    "although the energy density of the galactic radiation background is higher than that of the cmb , its importance is strongly reduced in the energy region above 100  gev due to the klein - nishina effect ( aharonian et al .",
    "therefore we consider here only the cmb photon field as the external seed photons for the production of tev photons .",
    "the characteristic energy , @xmath86 , of synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons with typical lorentz factor @xmath0 is given as e_syn = h_syn=^2eb / m_ec ~1b_-5(/10 ^ 8)^2  kev .",
    "the characteristic energy of the photons from the ics of these same energy electrons on the cmb photons is given by e_ic=^2 h_0~1(/10 ^ 8)^2(h_0/_cmb )  tev , where @xmath87  ev is the energy of the cmb photons .",
    "the ratio of the luminosity of the emission from the ics process to that from synchrotron radiation can be simply obtained as ( @xmath88 ) = w_cmbw_b , where @xmath89 is the energy density of the magnetic field . to derive the @xmath0-ray luminosity of tev photons by the ics process",
    ", we can first estimate the synchrotron x - ray luminosity of the pulsar wind nebulae using the one - zone model discussed in   2.2 .",
    "the tev photon luminosity and flux distributions will be studied in detail in   6 using a simulated sample of mature pulsars .",

    "the age of the gould belt is @xmath186 yrs . again the birth rate of pulsars in the gould belt is not certain but a rate of 20 myr@xmath36 is generally used ( grenier 2000 ) . basically the birth rates will only affect the final number of @xmath0-ray pulsars but not their distributions .",
    "the sun is inside the gould belt and is located about 200 pc towards @xmath187 ( guillout et al .",
    "the gould belt has an ellipsoidal shaped ring with semi - major and minor axes equal to 500 pc and 340 pc respectively .",
    "the initial position for each pulsar in the galaxy is distributed according to the mass distribution of the galaxy .",
    "we use the mass distribution suggested by paczynski ( 1990 ) and sturner &  dermer ( 1996 ) .",
    "but the initial position of each pulsar is assumed to be born uniformly inside the gould belt .",
    "the initial magnetic field @xmath188 is assumed to be gaussian , with a mean value of 12.5 and a dispersion of 0.3 .",
    "since the pulsars in our simulation sample are all younger than 10 million years , and the magnetic field does not decay in 10 myr ( bhattacharya et al . 1992 ) , we have ignored the field decay for these pulsars .",
    "the initial period is chosen to be @xmath189  ms , and the period at time @xmath190 is given by @xmath191 .",
    "the initial velocity of each pulsar is the vector sum of the circular rotation velocity at the birth location and the random velocity from the supernova explosion ( paczynski 1990 ) .",
    "the circular velocity is determined by the galactic gravitational potential and the maxwellian three - dimensional root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity is assumed to be @xmath192 ( lorimer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pulsar position at time @xmath190 is determined following its motion in the galactic gravitational potential . using the equations given by paczynski ( 1990 ) for the given initial velocity , orbit integrations are performed using the fourth - order runge kutta method with variable time steps on the variables @xmath193 , and @xmath194 .",
    "the sky positions and distances to the simulated pulsars can then be calculated .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath7 of each pulsar is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution ( biggs 1990 ) .",

    "this current result is slightly different from the simulations presented in cheng et al .",
    "( 2004a ) because of the revised age restrictions here of taking only mature pulsars of @xmath205 years .",

    "the predicted @xmath0-ray pulsar numbers appear very much larger than the confirmed @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "we should notice that first , not all 76 predicted are radio - loud .",
    "the radio beaming factor is roughly 0.15 ( emmering and & chevalier 1989 ; biggs 1990 ) .",
    "taking the radio beaming factor into account , we predict that @xmath10512 egret unidentified sources will be identified in the radio band in future .",
    "in fact recently there are 20 known radio pulsars located within the error boxes of egret sources and many of them may be identified as radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars ( manchester 2004 ) .",
    "it is very important to note that tev @xmath0-rays from pulsar wind nebulae are isotropic and independent of radio - loud or radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars .    in figure 1",
    ", we plot the distributions of the pulsar period ( upper panel ) and the magnetic field ( bottom panel ) of our simulated sample , for both sources in the the high latitudes of @xmath206 ( solid histogram ) , and in the low latitudes @xmath207 ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "the proper motion velocity ( top panel ) and distance ( bottom panel ) distributions of our mature pulsar sample are presented in figure 2 .",

    "we have taken this value in equation ( 5 ) to estimate the termination radius ( cf .   2.2 ) .",
    "we show also in figure  2 that the low and high latitude pulsar samples have different distance distributions .",
    "the average distance of the pulsars in the galactic plane ( @xmath2 ) is determined to be @xmath209  pc , while the average distance is @xmath210 pc for the high latitude sample ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this suggests that many high latitude @xmath0-ray mature pulsars may lie in the gould belt .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the @xmath0-ray luminosity versus spin down power of our simulated @xmath0-ray pulsar sample .",
    "the spin down power are all found to be lower than @xmath160 , which is consistent with our expectations .",
    "many of them in the galactic plane may be the geminga - like pulsars .",
    "if we fit the simulated relation of @xmath0-ray luminosity versus spin down power with single power law and it is consistent with the observed correlation of the known @xmath0-ray pulsars , @xmath211 ( thompson 2001 ) .",
    "however , from figure 3 there probably exist two populations of the relations : one population follows @xmath212 ; another population emerges as a branch for @xmath213 , with @xmath214 .",
    "zhang et al . (",
    "2004 ) have provided a possible explanation for the nature of these two populations and they estimate the separation of the two populations should occur at @xmath215 .",
    "assuming that mature pulsars can form faint and compact nebulae , and can produce tev photons through ics processes , the ics flux from the pulsar nebulae can be calculated by f _ , tev = l^ics/4d^2 e _ , where @xmath216 ( see   3 ) , and @xmath217 is the threshold energy , taken to be 1  tev . in order to calculate the tev luminosity for each of the simulated pulsars .",
    "we have to choose some fixed values for the pulsar wind parameters , i.e. @xmath218 , p and @xmath47 , which are produced in non - linear processes and will certainly vary from pulsar to pulsar .",

    "the choices of these parameters are consistent with theoretical estimations .    in figure 4",
    ", we plot the gev @xmath0-ray photon flux from the pulsar outer gap versus the tev photon flux from the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "there exists a correlation between the gev and tev fluxes because both quantities depend on the pulsar spin down power .",
    "this suggests that strong egret sources may be potential tev sources to be detected by present and future tev telescopes .",
    "the tev flux distribution of the mature pulsars at high latitudes , @xmath3 ( solid histogram ) and on the galactic plane , @xmath2 ( dashed histogram ) , are presented in figure  5 .",
    "the predicted tev fluxes of our low latitude simulated sample are all lower than @xmath223 , which is also the upper flux limit of all but two of the high latitude sample .",
    "the predicted tev flux from our sample is lower than the previous observational constraints mentioned earlier in the introduction .",
    "however , with the rapid advancements of the ground - based tev telescopes , some of the unidentified egret sources could be identified as tev sources in the future .",
    "we study the high energy radiation from mature pulsars with ages of @xmath1 years in the present paper .",
    "we consider 100  mev to gev @xmath0-rays generated from the magnetosphere of mature @xmath0-ray pulsars based on a new self - consistent outer gap model , which includes the effects of inclination angle and the average properties of the outer gap ( zhang et al .",
    "the relativistic wind particles from these mature pulsars interact with the interstellar medium , and form compact wind nebulae .",
    "the wind nebulae then produce x - ray emission through synchrotron radiation , and tev photons from ics by relativistic electrons on cosmic microwave background and synchrotron seed photons .",
    "we investigate the nebula radiation using a one - zone model , which has been shown to be able to predict the high energy properties of known pulsar wind nebulae ( cheng et al .",
    "we conclude that in mature pulsars , the synchrotron radiation and the ics processes like ssc can not significantly contribute in the 100 mev to gev energy band because of the weak magnetic field present ( @xmath74  g ) .",
    "however , it is possible that the nebulae of young pulsars in the galactic plane surrounded by supernova remnants , e.g. the crab nebula , can contribute to the 100 mev to gev energy band through synchrotron and ssc processes",
    ".    we would like to remark that pulsed tev emission is expected to be produced inside the light cylinder via inverse compton scattering between the soft photons and the relativistic charged particles inside the outer gap . in the new outer gap models",
    "( zhang et al .",
    "2004 ) , the soft photon density is just enough to convert one out of 10@xmath224 gamma - ray photons into pairs . the inverse compton scattering efficiency is expected to be lower than 10@xmath225 of the outer gap power .",
    "therefore , it is not surprised that none of known egret pulsars has been detected with pulsed tev photons . on the other hand , tev photons",
    "associated pulsars should be produced by pwn via the inverse compton scattering and therefore should be unpulsed .",
    "the crab nebula has been confirmed with tev detection .",
    "psr1706 - 44 is considered as another confirmed tev source ( weekes 2004 ) but the recent hess results challenge this claim .",
    "geminga is a very nearby known egret pulsar but yet no positive detection on tev . for the former pulsar , we have speculated that the emission from pwn may be variable with a time scale of years and the latter may attribute to the fact that the magnetic field strength in pwn is so weak that the tev flux produced by ssc is also very weak . in short , there are some evidences that tev photons can be emitted from some known egret pulsar pwne . therefore we believe that if the egret unidentified sources are indeed pulsars , some of their pwne should emit detectable tev photon fluxes .",
    "finally , we calculate the tev fluxes from wind nebulae of these mature pulsars through inverse compton processes .",
    "the predicted tev fluxes are consistent with the recent observational constraints obtained at the whipple observatory .",
    "in addition , our results predict that the unidentified egret sources , especially the strong sources , can be potential tev sources to be be detected by future ground - based tev telescopes .",
    "several third generation ground - based tev telescopes are under construction or recently finished , e.g. , magic ( lorenz 1999 ; 2004 ) , hess ( hofmann 1999 ; hinton 2004 ) , veritas ( weekes et al . 2002 ; krennrich et al .",
    "2004 ) , and cangaroo - iii ( matsubara 1997 ; kubo et al .",
    "the high sensitivity of these new tev telescopes offer the possibility of investigating the unidentified egret sources .",
    "for example , hess is an imaging telescope array system with an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "now it is fully operational , and its expected sensitivity at 1 tev is about @xmath226 , then we also expect hess could possibly detect tev photons from about 15 unidentified egret sources if they are mature pulsars ."
