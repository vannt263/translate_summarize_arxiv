    "the precise determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element  @xmath8 is a crucial step for @xmath9 physics to pursue phenomena beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular , the precision achieved in determining the apex of the unitarity triangle may be limited by @xmath10 , even with future high - statistics experiments .",
    "the current determination of @xmath10  @xcite is made through inclusive  @xcite and exclusive  @xcite @xmath9  decays .",
    "the heavy quark expansion offers a method to evaluate the hadronic transition amplitude in a systematic way .",
    "in particular , at the kinematic end point the exclusive @xmath11 matrix element is normalized in the infinite heavy quark mass limit , and the correction of order @xmath12 vanishes as a consequence of luke s theorem  @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to achieve an accuracy on  @xmath10 of a few percent .",
    "calculations of the @xmath13 ( and higher order ) deviations from the heavy quark limit have previously been attempted with the non - relativistic quark model and with qcd sum rules .",
    "lattice qcd has the potential to calculate exclusive transition matrix elements from first principles .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath14 decay form factors have already been calculated successfully with propagating  @xcite , static  @xcite , and non - relativistic  @xcite heavy quarks . on the other hand ,",
    "a precise determination of the absolute normalization of the form factors has not been achieved .",
    "this paper fills that gap for the decay @xmath0 .",
    "previous lattice calculations were unable to obtain the normalization of the form factors for various reasons .",
    "first , the statistical precision of the three point function @xmath15 , which is calculated by monte carlo integration , has not been enough .",
    "second , perturbative matching between the lattice and the continuum currents has been a large source of uncertainty .",
    "since the local vector current defined on the lattice is not a conserved current at finite lattice spacing  @xmath16 , the matching factor is not normalized even in the limit of degenerate quarks .",
    "although one - loop perturbation theory works significantly better with tadpole improvement  @xcite , the two - loop contribution remains significant ( @xmath17 5  % ) .",
    "last , the systematic error associated with the large heavy quark mass must be understood .",
    "previous work with wilson quarks  @xcite , for which the discretization error was as large as @xmath18 , could not address the @xmath12 dependence in a systematic way when @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we present a lattice qcd calculation of the @xmath0 decay form factor . for the heavy quark we use an improved action  @xcite for wilson fermions ,",
    "reinterpreted in a way mindful of heavy - quark symmetry  @xcite .",
    "discretization errors proportional to powers of  @xmath20 do not exist in this approach . instead , discretization errors proportional to powers of @xmath21 remain , although they are intertwined with the  @xmath12 expansion .",
    "the first extensive application of this approach to heavy - light systems was the calculation  @xcite of the heavy - light decay constants , such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "there the lattice spacing dependence was studied from direct calculations at several lattice spacings , and a very small @xmath16 dependence was observed .",
    "the third difficulty mentioned above is , thus , no longer a problem .    to obtain better precision on the semi - leptonic form factors ,",
    "we introduce ratios of three - point correlation functions .",
    "the bulk of statistical fluctuations from the monte carlo integration cancels between numerator and denominator .",
    "furthermore , the ratios are , by construction , identically one in both the degenerate - mass limit and the heavy - quark - symmetry limit",
    ". consequently , statistical and all systematic errors , as well as the signal , are proportional to the deviation from one .",
    "the first and second difficulties given above are , thus , also essentially cured .",
    "the ratio of correlation functions for the calculation of @xmath24 corresponds to the ratio of matrix elements , @xmath25 in which all external states are at rest .",
    "the denominator may be considered as a normalization condition of the heavy - to - heavy vector current , since the vector current @xmath26 with degenerate quark masses is conserved in the continuum limit , and its matrix element is , therefore , normalized . as a result the perturbative matching between the lattice and continuum currents gives only a small correction to  @xmath27 .    for the calculation of @xmath3",
    "we define another ratio , corresponding to matrix elements @xmath28 where equality holds when the final - state @xmath29 meson has small spatial momentum . by construction",
    ", the ratio produces a value of @xmath30 that vanishes when the @xmath31 quark has the same mass as the @xmath32 quark , as required by current conservation .",
    "this method does not work as it stands for the @xmath33 decay form factors .",
    "the axial vector current mediates this decay , and it is neither conserved nor normalized .",
    "we will deal separately with this case in another paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : form_factors ] contains a general discussion of form factors for the exclusive decay @xmath0 .",
    "sections  [ sec : hqet_and_1/m_q_expansion ] and  [ sec : lattice_and_hq ] discuss heavy quark effective theory and the @xmath12 expansion in the continuum and with the lattice action used here .",
    "section  [ sec : lattice_details ] contains details of the numerical calculations . sections  [ sec : calculation_of_h_+][sec : heavy_quark_mass_dependence_of_h- ] present our results . sections  [ sec : calculation_of_h_+ ] and [ sec : heavy_quark_mass_dependence_of_h+ ] discuss the form factor @xmath34 and its mass dependence .",
    "sections  [ sec : calculation_of_h_- ] and [ sec : heavy_quark_mass_dependence_of_h- ] do likewise for @xmath30 .",
    "we compare the results from the fits of the mass dependence to corresponding results from qcd sum rules in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison_with_the_qcd_sum_rules ] .",
    "the values of @xmath24 and @xmath35 at the physical quark masses are combined in sec .",
    "[ sec : result_for_f ] into a result for the form factor @xmath36 , which with experimental data determines  @xmath10 .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath0 is parametrized with two form factors @xmath1 and @xmath3 as @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the velocities of the @xmath9 and @xmath29 mesons , respectively , and @xmath40 .",
    "the square of the momentum transferred to the leptons is then @xmath41 .",
    "we denote by the symbol  @xmath42 the physical vector current , to distinguish it from currents in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and in lattice qcd .",
    "the differential decay rate reads @xmath43 with @xmath44 at zero recoil ( @xmath45 , so @xmath2 ) one expects @xmath36 to be close to one , because of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "from  ( [ eq : differential_decay_rate ] ) a determination of @xmath10 consists of the following three steps : measure @xmath46 in an experiment , extrapolate it to the zero - recoil limit assuming some functional form , and use the theoretical input of @xmath36",
    ".    in this paper we report on a new calculation of @xmath36 with lattice qcd , which is model independent , at least in principle .",
    "the present calculation includes the leading corrections to the heavy - quark limit : radiative corrections to the static limit of  @xmath47 , the @xmath12 contribution of  @xmath48 , and the @xmath13 contributions of  @xmath49 .",
    "radiative corrections of order  @xmath50 to  @xmath35 are not yet available , but these and further corrections , of order @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc . , could be included in future applications of our numerical technique , once the needed perturbative results become available .",
    "an obvious disadvantage in using the @xmath0 decay mode is that the branching fraction is much smaller than the @xmath33 mode .",
    "another , but not less important , shortcoming is that the phase - space suppression factor @xmath53 makes the extrapolation of the experimental data to @xmath2 more difficult than for @xmath33 , where the corresponding factor is @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental result of the cleo collaboration  @xcite shows that the above method certainly works , even with current statistics .",
    "that means that future improvement of the statistics will allow a much better determination of  @xmath10 , providing an important cross check against other methods .",
    "many important theoretical results have been obtained for the form factors with hqet .",
    "the lagrangian of hqet uses fields of infinitely heavy quarks , so that heavy quark symmetries are manifest .",
    "the effects of finite quark mass are included through the @xmath12 expansion and through radiative corrections .",
    "for example , at zero recoil the form factor  @xmath34 is given by @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 represents a matching factor relating the vector current in  ( [ eq : definition_of_the_form_factors ] ) to the current in hqet  @xcite .",
    "the absence of the @xmath57 term in  ( [ eq:1/m_q - expansion+ ] ) is a result of a symmetry under an interchange of initial and final states in  ( [ eq : definition_of_the_form_factors ] ) , and it is known as a part of luke s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the same symmetry also restricts the form of the @xmath58 terms .",
    "the matching factor , defined so that the identity @xmath59 holds for matrix elements , is an ultraviolet- and infrared - finite function of @xmath60 . through one - loop perturbation theory , @xmath61 the two - loop coefficient is also available  @xcite .",
    "the vector current defined with lattice fermion fields has properties similar to  @xmath62 .",
    "there is a normalization factor  @xmath63 defined so that @xmath64 holds for matrix elements .",
    "the factor @xmath63 depends strongly on the ( lattice ) quark masses @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xcite , and its one - loop corrections are large . in the past , such uncertainties in the normalization prevented a calculation of @xmath47 with the sought - after accuracy .",
    "one can , however , capture most of the normalization nonperturbatively by writing , with explicit flavor indices , @xmath67 in our ratio  ( [ eq : ratio_1 ] ) the flavor - diagonal factors cancel , so our method avoids the major normalization uncertainties .",
    "the remaining radiative correction @xmath68 depends on the ratio of quark masses and the lattice spacing . in the continuum limit ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath60 fixed , @xmath71 by construction . in the static limit , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with  @xmath16 and @xmath60 fixed , @xmath74 because the lattice theory strictly obeys heavy - quark symmetries . in numerical work",
    "one is somewhere in between , but the limits imply that @xmath75 is never far from unity .",
    "two of us have computed @xmath75 at one loop in perturbation theory  @xcite , verifying explicitly that the radiative correction is small .",
    "similarly , the ratio  ( [ eq : ratio_2 ] ) is described by the expansion @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a coefficient from matching the currents in  ( [ eq : ratio_2 ] ) to hqet .",
    "like  @xmath78 , it is an ultraviolet- and infrared - finite function of  @xmath60 , and @xmath79 at leading order .",
    "the ratio  ( [ eq : ratio_2 ] ) again captures nonperturbatively most of the renormalization of the lattice currents , apart from a factor @xmath80 to compensate for the difference between the radiative corrections with a fixed lattice cutoff and with no ultraviolet cutoff . in the continuum limit @xmath81 , and in the static limit @xmath82 .",
    "again , explicit calculation verifies that the one loop contribution remains small between the limits .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we do not write the matching factors @xmath83 when there is no risk of confusion . in the final result ,",
    "on the other hand , they are included .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the usual action for light quarks  @xcite can be analyzed in terms of the operators of hqet .",
    "therefore , it can be used as the basis of a systematic treatment of heavy quarks on the lattice , even when the quark mass in lattice units , @xmath20 , is not especially small .",
    "the key is to adjust the couplings in the lattice action so that operators are normalized as they are in hqet .",
    "when @xmath84 , as is the case for charmed quarks at the smaller lattice spacings in common use , this is essentially automatic , because the higher order terms of the heavy quark expansion come from the dirac term of the lattice action , as in continuum qcd .",
    "when @xmath85 , as is the case for bottom quarks , one can apply the formalism of hqet to the lattice theory to obtain the normalization conditions , as sketched below . in either case ,",
    "the kinetic energy is normalized nonperturbatively by tuning the quark mass according to some physical condition .",
    "other operators are often normalized perturbatively as an initial approximation but ultimately may be normalized nonperturbatively .    in the numerical calculations presented here",
    ", we use an action introduced by sheikholeslami and wohlert  @xcite , @xmath86 where the index  @xmath87 runs over heavy and light flavors .",
    "the hopping parameter  @xmath88 is related to the bare quark mass , @xmath89 where  @xmath90 is the value of  @xmath91 needed to make a quark massless .",
    "the flavor - independent matrix  @xmath92 vanishes except when @xmath93 , for some spacetime direction  @xmath94 .",
    "the kinetic energy arises from this term .",
    "the gluons field strength  @xmath95 is defined on a set of paths shaped liked a four - leaf clover , so  @xmath96 is often called the `` clover '' action . with @xmath97 one",
    "has the wilson action .    for the light quark the clover coupling  @xmath98",
    "can be chosen so that there are lattice artifacts of order  @xmath99 . in our numerical work",
    "we take an approximation to the optimal value , leaving an artifact of order @xmath100 .    for heavy quarks",
    ", the clover action  ( [ eq : sw_action ] ) has the same heavy - quark spin and flavor symmetries as continuum qcd , even at nonzero lattice spacing .",
    "consequently , we can use the machinery of hqet to characterize the lattice theory .",
    "the same operators as in continuum qcd appear , but the coefficients can differ . through first order in @xmath12",
    "there are three operators in the heavy quark effective hamiltonian , @xmath101 where  @xmath102 is a heavy quark field , and the coefficients @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 depend on the bare mass and the gauge coupling . because the lattice breaks relativistic invariance , the three `` masses '' are not necessarily equal , except as @xmath106 .    at tree level ,",
    "the rest mass @xmath107 , and the ( inverse ) kinetic mass @xmath108 the first term can be traced to the dirac term of the lattice action , and the second to the wilson term .",
    "the one - loop corrections to @xmath109 and @xmath110 are also available  @xcite .",
    "the chromomagnetic mass  @xmath111 is considered below .    in the heavy quark",
    "effective theory , the rest mass term  @xmath112 commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian and , thus , decouples from the dynamics . as with decay constants  @xcite",
    ", one can derive the expansions like  ( [ eq:1/m_q - expansion+ ] ) and  ( [ eq:1/m_q - expansion- ] ) within the lattice theory , and the rest mass disappears from physical amplitudes  @xcite . on the other hand , adjusting the bare quark mass so that @xmath113 is the way to normalize the kinetic operator @xmath114 correctly .",
    "this normalization can be implemented nonperturbatively by demanding that the energy of a hadron have the correct momentum dependence . in our numerical work",
    "we use the @xmath9 and @xmath29 mesons for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , one can correctly normalize the chromomagnetic operator  @xmath115 by adjusting the clover coupling  @xmath98 , as a function of the gauge coupling , so that @xmath116 . for example , at tree level the desired adjustment is @xmath117 . in our numerical work , we choose @xmath98 in a way that sums up tadpole diagrams , which dominate perturbation theory .",
    "this amounts to normalizing the chromomagnetic operator perturbatively .    in summary , we adjust the bare mass  @xmath118 and clover coupling  @xmath98 so that the leading effects of the heavy - quark expansion are correctly accounted for  @xcite . previous work in the literature chose instead to adjust the bare mass until @xmath119 , which introduces an unnecessarily large error , expansion with higher orders . ] proportional to @xmath120",
    ".    under renormalization the heavy quark kinetic energy can mix with the rest mass term in a power divergent way . because the lattice action used here contains both , the rest mass fully absorbs the power divergence .",
    "a related problem is the ambiguity owing to renormalons  @xcite , which appears in some quantities in hqet or nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) .",
    "it is irrelevant to our work , because we calculate physical quantities , namely the masses of the @xmath9 and @xmath29 mesons and decay amplitude for @xmath0 .    to complete the correspondence of the lattice theory to hqet",
    "we must consider the vector current . at order @xmath12 of hqet @xmath121 where the coefficient @xmath122 depends on the current employed .",
    "the heavy - heavy current on the lattice is constructed by defining a rotated field  @xcite , @xmath123\\psi^f , \\label{eq : rotation}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the quark field in the hopping - parameter form of the action  ( [ eq : sw_action ] ) . then the lattice vector current @xmath125 and @xmath126 . both  @xmath127 and",
    "@xmath128 depend on the gauge coupling , the masses , and ( at higher orders ) on the dirac matrix in  ( [ eq : vhh ] ) .",
    "they are adjusted so that the normalization and momentum dependence of matrix elements matches the continuum , respectively .",
    "in particular , at tree level the coefficient in  ( [ eq : vhh ] ) is @xmath129 and the condition @xmath130 prescribes a condition on  @xmath131  @xcite . from the properties of the operators under heavy - quark symmetry",
    ", it follows that the  @xmath104 and  @xmath105 terms in  ( [ eq : h ] ) could give a contribution to  @xmath24 , but not to  @xmath35  @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", these contributions to  @xmath24 must be symmetric under interchange of the initial and final states , but , on the other hand , they must vanish when the initial and final quark masses are the same .",
    "consequently , there can be no contributions linear in either  @xmath104 or  @xmath105 .",
    "our definition of  @xmath24 enjoys this property , by construction , because  ( [ eq : ratio_1 ] ) manifestly respects the interchange symmetry .",
    "similarly , the @xmath122 terms in  ( [ eq : vhh ] ) give a contribution only to  @xmath35 .",
    "it must be anti - symmetric under interchange of the initial and final states and must vanish when the initial and final quark masses are the same .",
    "our definition of  @xmath35 , again by construction , ensures that only the combination @xmath132 appears .",
    "this feature is taken into account in sec .",
    "[ sec : heavy_quark_mass_dependence_of_h- ] .",
    "in  ( [ eq:1/m_q - expansion+ ] ) and  ( [ eq:1/m_q - expansion- ] ) we seek contributions of order  @xmath13 .",
    "these come from double insertions of the @xmath12 terms in  ( [ eq : h ] ) and  ( [ eq : vhh ] ) , and from @xmath13 terms implied by the ellipses .",
    "remarkably , the latter cancel when  @xmath24 and  @xmath35 are defined by the double ratios  ( [ eq : ratio_1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ratio_2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "this is easy to understand if one starts with the matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath133 and @xmath134 corrections to the action arise from the initial or final state only . to this order",
    ", one can factorize them .",
    "they drop out of the double ratios , because the numerator and denominator of  ( [ eq : ratio_1 ] ) or  ( [ eq : ratio_2 ] ) contain the same number of @xmath9 and @xmath29 factors .",
    "the same applies to @xmath133 and @xmath134 corrections to the current .",
    "there may be a nonfactorizable correction to the current with coefficient @xmath135 , where the function @xmath136 is unknown , except that in perturbation theory it starts at one loop and that @xmath137 .    in the long run , one would like to pick up terms of order  @xmath138 and higher . because the bottom quark is so heavy ,",
    "these are dominated by the @xmath139 terms . with the normalization conditions outlined here  @xcite ,",
    "these come automatically from the dirac term , as in continuum qcd .",
    "in future work , at smaller lattice spacings , the dirac term will dominate , generating contributions to all orders in  @xmath140 .",
    "our numerical data are obtained in the quenched approximation on a @xmath141 lattice with the plaquette gluon action at  @xmath142 .",
    "we take a mean - field - improved  @xcite value of the clover coupling , which on this lattice is @xmath143 . out of 300 configurations generated for our previous work  @xcite ,",

    "our main result is the value of the form factor entering the decay rate , at zero recoil . inserting the physical values of the @xmath9 and @xmath29 meson masses and the results  ( [ eq : result_h+ ] ) and  ( [ eq : result_h- ] ) into  ( [ eq : form_factor_relation ] ) , @xmath192 where errors are from statistics , heavy quark masses , and omitted radiative corrections .",
    "the last of these could be reduced substantially by calculating the radiative correction factor  @xmath190 to one loop .",
    "two sources of uncertainty have yet to be investigated carefully .",
    "they are the dependence on the lattice spacing and the effects of the quenched approximation . from our experience with @xmath22  @xcite",
    ", we might suppose that these effects are a few percent and @xmath193 , respectively .",
    "the ratios have been constructed so that all sources of error , including these , vanish for equal heavy quark masses .",
    "it is , therefore , our expectation that these percentages apply not to @xmath194 but to @xmath195 .",
    "that means that these two sources of error should be under good control , just as we have found with the other sources of uncertainty .",
    "in this paper we have shown that precise lattice calculations of the zero - recoil form factors @xmath24 and @xmath35 are possible .",
    "the principal technical advance is to consider ratios of matrix elements , in which a large cancellation of statistical and systematic errors takes place .",
    "the numerical data are interpreted in a way mindful of heavy quark symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we find , therefore , that the dependence of the form factors on the heavy quark mass is well described by @xmath12 expansions , and we obtain the coefficients in the expansions .",
    "our control over the heavy quark mass dependence allows us to determine the individual form factors  @xmath24 and  @xmath35 , as well as the physical combination @xmath36 .",
    "the main results  ( [ eq : result_h+])([eq : result_f(1 ) ] ) account for most uncertainties , but not the dependence on the lattice spacing or the effect of the quenched approximation . since our method",
    "is designed to yield the deviation of @xmath36 from one , we do not expect these qualitatively to spoil the quoted precision . with the proof of principle provided by this work",
    ", it should be possible , in the short term , to obtain @xmath36 with control over all sources of uncertainty and an error bar that is small enough to be relevant to the determination of  @xmath10 .",
