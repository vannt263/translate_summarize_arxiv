    "the penna model , introduced by penna in 1995 @xcite , has been extensively studied through simulation @xcite .",
    "it models senescence in an asexually reproducing population , with the lifetime of an individual encoded in a simple bit - string model of its genome . during reproduction the bit - string is allowed to copy and mutate , so that the population evolves a distribution of genetic lifespans .",
    "the model is powerful enough to reproduce some aspects of observed real - life behaviour , and adaptable enough to allow modifications aimed at greater realism @xcite .",
    "one shortcoming of the standard penna model is that a mutated genome is always worse than its parent @xcite .",
    "while this is a reasonable assumption , given that the rate of beneficial mutations is small compared to that of harmful ones , very little work has been carried out on penna models with positive mutations @xcite . here",
    "we develop an analytical solution to a penna model with a small rate of positive mutation .",
    "our analysis builds upon previous work where a solution to a generalized class of stochastic penna models was presented @xcite .",
    "all populations are considered in the thermodynamic limit of a large population where statistical fluctuations and effects of discretization can be ignored .",
    "the exact limiting behavior found below gives insight into any population large enough for these two effects to be unimportant .    in the standard ( deterministic ) penna model",
    ", the bit - string determines the lifespan of an organism directly .",
    "one way ( but not the only way @xcite ) to interpret this is to say that there is a set of hereditable diseases , which strike the organism at a set of fixed ages during its lifetime .",
    "once it has developed a given number of these , the organism dies .",
    "although the age of death is thus programmed from birth , an individual is in effect reading the bit string sequentially through its life ; it drops dead after encountering the specified number of defective bits .",
    "( we call these 1s ; the rest are 0s . )",
    "so long as it lives , the organism produces offspring at a steady rate ; these inherit the parental genome , with a small rate @xmath0 of harmful mutation ( @xmath1 ) and , in this paper , an even smaller rate @xmath2 for positive mutation , @xmath3 .",
    "the simplest of all penna models is that in which an organism dies after developing a single disease . for clarity of argument",
    "we confine our discussion to this version of the penna model in sections [ simple],[positive ] .",
    "however , the analysis of positive mutations that we present here can be adapted to any of the more sophisticated penna model variants we have solved @xcite . in section [ mortality ] we address a stochastic variant showing a mortality plateau @xcite .",
    "we consider first the single - disease simple penna model , without positive mutation .",
    "the sites along the bit - string are numbered @xmath4 ; an organism in whose bit - string the first @xmath5 occurs on site @xmath6 will live for exactly @xmath6 timesteps and thus has ` genetic lifespan ' @xmath6 . note that an organism with @xmath7 ( i.e. , a @xmath5 at site @xmath8 in the string ) will die instantly and never contributes to the population .",
    "note also that @xmath9 can be thought of as the age of an organism ; so long as @xmath10 , it remains alive .    the number of organisms with age @xmath9 and genetic lifespan @xmath6 at timestep @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "newborn organisms with genetic lifespan @xmath6 can be produced either as copies of organisms with the same @xmath6 , or as mutated copies of organisms of lifespan @xmath13 . in both cases ,",
    "sites @xmath14 must go unmutated .",
    "these dynamics give the following discrete evolution equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 , with @xmath0 the ( small ) mutation rate and @xmath17 the birth rate .",
    "the sum over ages of @xmath18 is defined to be @xmath19 and can be evaluated at steady state to give @xmath20 . at steady state ,",
    "the size of any part of the population is time - independent .",
    "manipulation of ( [ spm_1 ] ) then gives a recursion relation for the relative sizes of sub - populations at steady state : @xmath21    for the population to remain finite there must be a maximum sustainable gentic lifespan @xmath22 ; for @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( see section [ paradox ] for further discussion ) .",
    "any sub - population with a smaller genetic lifespan is partly reliant on a flux , by mutation , from longer lived sub - populations .",
    "these two conditions give restrictions on the choice of @xmath22 , @xmath17 and @xmath25 , as explained , and confirmed by simulation , in @xcite : @xmath26",
    "we now introduce a small positive mutation rate @xmath2 into the simple one - disease penna model just described .",
    "just as a harmful mutation converts a @xmath27 into a @xmath5 , a positive mutation rate @xmath2 converts a @xmath5 into a @xmath27 with probability @xmath2 . the rate @xmath2 is taken to be sufficiently small that there is no chance of multiple positive mutations occuring on the same organism .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath2 is small compared to the rate @xmath25 of harmful mutations .",
    "this ensures that after the first @xmath5 in an organism s bit string , the remaining bits are , to high accuracy , all @xmath5 s due to the accumulated effects of harmful mutations . in the absence of positive mutation",
    "this is clearly the case , as the accumulation of harmful mutations is irreversible and there is no evolutionary pressure for an organism to have healthy sites on its bit - string beyond the site @xmath28 .",
    "positive mutations allow this accumulation to be reversed , but so long as @xmath29 , there remains no evolutionary pressure on sites after the first @xmath5 ; an organism s bit - string can thus be taken to consist of entirely @xmath5 s after the first @xmath5 .",
    "this is a very strong condition , and in steady state it allows ( as in section [ simple ] ) any bit - string to be characterized by a single number , the genetic lifespan @xmath6 .",
    "when considering mutations on an offspring , we impose that positive mutations take place first , then negative mutations .",
    "this is to further enforce the weak nature of positive mutations , preventing them from overriding harmful mutations in the same time - step .    introducing the positive mutation rate @xmath2 then gives a slightly modified equation for @xmath30 in place of eq.([spm_1 ] ) : @xmath31 the first term on the right corresponds to organisms with genetic lifespan @xmath6 reproducing with no harmful mutations at sites @xmath10 and no positive mutation at @xmath28 .",
    "( note that there are @xmath6 sites with @xmath10 ; the factor @xmath32 is the probability of no harmful mutation at any of these . )",
    "the second term corresponds to offspring from organisms with lifespan @xmath33 with one positive mutation ( at site @xmath33 ) and no harmful mutations at sites @xmath10 .",
    "the third term gives mutated offspring from longer lived organisms ( of lifespan @xmath13 ) without positive mutation , without harmful mutation for sites @xmath10 , but with harmful mutation at site @xmath34 .",
    "the final term gives mutated offspring from longer lived organisms of lifespan @xmath35 where positive mutation occurs at site @xmath36 but is negated by harmful mutation at @xmath6 , with no harmful mutation for sites @xmath10 .",
    "defining @xmath37 as the total number of individuals of lifespan @xmath6 , in the steady state we find @xmath38 writing a similar expression for @xmath39 allows construction of a recursion relationship between @xmath19 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "( note that @xmath41 is known to be zero . )",
    "this can be written , for given @xmath25 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 , as : @xmath42n(l)-\\alpha b l n(l-1 ) } { e^{\\beta(l+1 ) } -(1-\\alpha)b(l+1)e^{-\\beta}}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that if @xmath2 is set to zero , eq.([spm_solution ] ) is recovered .",
    "deducing boundary conditions at large @xmath6 , in the presence of positive muations , is non - trivial .",
    "the possibility that an infinitely long lived organism can evolve from a population of shorter genetic lifespans means that no part of the population is uniquely self sustaining .",
    "this is in contrast to the simple penna model ( @xmath43 ) where the maximum sustainable genetic lifespan @xmath44 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit of a large population ; individuals of @xmath45 reproduce unmutated offspring at a rate that precisely balances their own death rate . with positive mutation present",
    "this can not be true .",
    "organisms of putative maximal lifespan @xmath44 can produce positively mutated offspring with a longer lifespan , and in a large enough population there can be no @xmath44 .    instead we insist that , for a steady state distribution to be physical , the population must be finite ( with the thermodynamic limit taken only at the end ) .",
    "the effects of this requirement can be seen by taking the limit of an arbitrarily small birth rate @xmath17 when taking this limit we do not apply the steady state conditions ( [ spm_lmax],[spm_b ] ) which hold for the simple penna model only . in the limit of a vanishing birth rate ,",
    "both the simple penna model and penna model with positive mutations return a recursion relation for the relative sizes of successive sub - populations as follows : @xmath46 this limiting expression is independent of the birth rate so that , as @xmath17 tends to zero the population can remain non - zero , with a distribution that is solely dependent on @xmath25 .",
    "this non - intuitive result can be explained by the behaviour of organisms with infinite @xmath6 . an infinitely long - lived organism can reproduce during its lifetime despite an arbitrarily small birth rate @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , in the limit of @xmath47 , the mutated offspring of this ` super organism ' make up the entire population",
    ". however , a population with even one super organism can not be finite since , according to ( [ sub ] ) , @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that steady state solutions of the recursion ( [ srecur ] ) involving the presence of a super organism are not physical , and should be discarded .",
    "to summarize , in the simple penna model of section [ simple ] the requirement of a finite population directly imposes an @xmath44 .",
    "when positive mutations are allowed there is no @xmath44 , but the population is still required to be finite .",
    "thus the steady state must not contain super organisms if it is to represent a physical population , and the thermodynamic limit must be taken so as to exclude them .",
    "[ paradox ]      an acceptable steady state can be found by imposing an artificial maximum genetic lifespan @xmath49 beyond which @xmath19 is taken to be zero . with this",
    "artificial cut - off , for specified @xmath2 and @xmath25 , @xmath17 can be found so as to satisfy the steady state conditions .",
    "as @xmath49 approaches infinity the difference between this approximate steady state and the real steady state will vanish for a sufficiently large population . the convergence of @xmath17 with increasing @xmath49 is shown in fig [ pmfig3 ] .",
    "we require that at @xmath49 the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 predicted by the positive mutation recursion relation satisfy to high order @xmath52 this ensures that contributions from longer lived organisms vanish , preventing the existence of a super organism as @xmath49 tends to infinity .",
    "this procedure resolves the paradoxes associated with the thermodynamic limit that were set out above , and allows us to find all the population properties from the recursion derived earlier .",
    "birth rate @xmath17 is plotted against the trucated genetic lifepan @xmath49 for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . in both cases @xmath57 .",
    "genetic lifespan is measured in timesteps.,width=288 ]    analytical results , found by this method , for a penna model with a small but non - zero @xmath2 are shown in fig [ pmfig4 ] .",
    "lifespan distributions for a penna model with positive mutations in which @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath56 ) and without positive mutations ( @xmath58 ) . in each case @xmath57 .",
    "genetic lifespan is measured in timesteps.,width=288 ]    the population distributions with and without positive mutations are not dissimilar , but there are crucial differences .",
    "as discussed , with positive mutations allowed there is no maximum genetic lifespan .",
    "what is observed instead is a small but non - zero population beyond what would be @xmath44 in the simple penna model ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the remaining distribution closely resembles @xmath43 , with @xmath44 taking its largest allowed value for the specified @xmath25 .",
    "note that , depending on the size and history of the population , the maximum lifespan of a simple penna population may be less than the largest permissible value of @xmath44 @xcite , due to the effect of muller s rachet @xcite . in other words , if a fluctuation within a finite population causes the self - sustaining sub - population of longest - lived individuals to die off , they can never return and the maximum lifespan is permanently reduced . with positive mutations",
    "this loss of fitness due to statistical fluctuations is reversible ; positive mutations can act to restore the mean fitness of a population which has fallen below the maximum permitted by the simple penna model .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrate that a penna model with a modified survival function can exhibit a mortality plateau at advanced ages @xcite ) .",
    "the strict deterministic nature of the original penna model is relaxed ; organisms with genetic lifespan @xmath6 do not necessarily die at age @xmath6 , though this is their expected lifespan .",
    "the ` step function ' survival up to age @xmath6 of the simple penna model is softened to a fermi - like function whose width parameter @xmath59 controls the genetic indeterminacy in the age of death .",
    "mortality rates for a penna model with positive mutations and fermi like survivability function in which @xmath60 , @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath56 ) and without positive mutations ( @xmath58 ) . in each case @xmath57 .",
    "age is measured in timesteps.,width=288 ]    we observe that for a small positive mutation rate the mortality plateau is preserved ( see fig [ mortplot ] ) .",
    "this plateau is the result of organisms living beyond @xmath6 ` on borrowed time ' @xcite .",
    "even with @xmath61 , the majority of the organisms at advanced ages are rare survivors to ages far beyond @xmath6 ; and the mortality of these survivors is almost constant . the variation in mortality rates as @xmath2 increases comes from the increased fraction of organisms with longer genetic lifespans ( see fig [ pmfig4 ] ) . since a positive mutation rate acts to increase the average lifespan of the population a corresponding decrease in mortality is to be expected .",
    "the nature of the positive mutations we have considered differs from that investigated by oliveira et al @xcite in that it does not increase the mean fitness of the population over time .",
    "our small positive mutation rate is a relatively weak effect and while it is able to restore the mean fitness of a population if pushed away from steady state ( offering limited protection from muller s ratchet ) it can not improve the population s fitness in a sustained manner .",
    "strong positive mutations , such as those considered by oliveira et al , are capable of sustained improvement in the fitness of a population but will take place over a far greater timescale than the weak positive mutations we have considered .",
    "our analysis is limited to a small positive mutation rate .",
    "if the positive mutation rate were to become comparable to the negative one @xcite(it must remain smaller for there to be a possible steady state ) , then the assumption that there is no evolutionary pressure on bits after the terminal one would become invalid and our description of the penna string would break down .",
    "however it has long been accepted that positive mutation is extremely rare compared to harmful mutation ; as such this work addresses the relevant regime ."
