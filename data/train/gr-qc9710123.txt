    "+ up to now no rotating generalization of higher genus solutions has been known .",
    "holst and peldan recently showed that there does not exist any ( 3 + 1)- dimensional generalization of the rotating btz black hole @xcite . therefore ,",

    "+ in this paper a rotating generalization of higher genus black holes together with another toroidal rotating solution will be presented . we do not present uniqueness results , and apart from noticing that there are more than one non isometric tori generating black holes , we content ourselves with a discussion of some of the relevant properties they have . + we begin in sec.(ii ) with the spacetime metric for the genus @xmath2 solution and give a proof that it solves einstein s field equations with negative @xmath3-term .",
    "+ in sec.(iii ) we determine the black hole interpretation of the metric , and we consider in which sense mass and angular momentum are defined and conserved",
    ". we shall give a detailed description of the rather intricate causal structure and the related penrose - carter diagrams , but we do not discuss whether the black holes can result from gravitational collapse .",
    "+ in sec.(iv ) we describe the rotating toroidal black hole s metric , together with an account of its main features , including the causal structure and the causal diagrams .",
    "+ in this paper we shall use the curvature conventions of hawking - ellis book @xcite and employ planck s dimensionless units .",
    "we begin by recalling the uncharged topological black holes discussed in @xcite .",
    "the metric appropriate for genus @xmath2 reads @xmath4 with the lapse function @xmath5 given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass parameter and @xmath8 the cosmological constant .",
    "one notices that the @xmath9-sector of the metric describes the two - dimensional non - compact space with constant , negative curvature .",
    "as is well known , this is the universal covering space for all riemannian surfaces with genus @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in order to get a compact event horizon , suitable identifications in the @xmath9-sector have to be carried out , corresponding to the choice of some discrete group of isometries acting on hyperbolic @xmath10-space properly discontinuously .",
    "after this has been done , the metric ( [ luciano ] ) will describe higher genus black holes .",
    "the @xmath11 case , with toroidal event horizon , is given by the metric @xmath12 with the lapse function @xmath5 given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the line element of a flat torus .",
    "its conformal structure is completely determined by a complex parameter in the upper complex half plane , @xmath15 , which is known as the teichmller parameter .",
    "a rappresentative for the flat torus metric can then be written in the form @xmath16 it is quite trivial to show that all such solutions have indeed a black hole interpretation , with various horizons located at roots of the algebraic equation @xmath17 , provided @xmath7 be larger than some critical value depending on @xmath3 .",
    "it can also be shown that for all genus , a ground state can be defined relative to which the adm mass is a positive , concave function @xcite of the black hole s temperature as defined by its surface gravity @xcite , and that the entropy obeys the area law@xcite .",
    "we now determine at least one class of rotating generalizations of the above solutions starting with the higher genus case , namely when @xmath2 .",
    "the toroidal rotating black hole will be described last .",
    "the metric ( [ luciano ] ) looks very similar to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xcite @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 ) .",
    "+ for the latter , it is well known that a generalization to the rotating case exists , namely the kerr - de sitter spacetime @xcite , which describes rotating black holes in an asymptotically de sitter - space .",

    "the timelike @xmath31-surfaces at fixed coordinate radius @xmath32 are foliated by surfaces at fixed coordinate time @xmath33 into a family of spacelike @xmath10-surfaces , and we would like these to be riemann surfaces with genus @xmath2 . the metric induced on such surfaces is @xmath34 note that the gaussian curvature of this metric is no more constant , as it was in the case @xmath27 .",
    "+ in order to get a euclidean metric we have to require that @xmath35 .",

    "+ the compactification is now performed in the same way as for a riemann surface of constant curvature ( i.  e.  for @xmath41 ; in this case see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "that is , we have to identify opposite sides of a properly chosen regular geodesic @xmath42-gon centered at the origin @xmath43 .",
    "the geodesics have to be computed from the metric ( [ rieman ] ) , and therefore they are different from those in the case of constant curvature .",
    "the size of the @xmath42-gon is determined by the requirement that the sum of the polygon angles being equal to @xmath44 @xcite , in order to avoid conical singularities .",
    "indeed , the local version of the gauss - bonnet theorem yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the interior of the geodesic polygon , @xmath47 the gaussian curvature of the @xmath9-surface , @xmath48 the area element of the metric ( [ rieman ] ) , and @xmath49 the @xmath50-th polygon angle .",
    "( of course , the @xmath49 are all equal , as the polygon is regular ) . from ( [ gb ] )",
    "we see that the requirement @xmath51 fixes the size of @xmath46 .",
    "( [ gb ] ) then gives @xmath52 which is the gauss - bonnet theorem for a riemann surface of genus @xmath53 .",
    "a priori , it is not obvious that a polygon which satisfies ( [ gbglob ] ) with @xmath2 really exists . therefore let us sketch a short existence proof .",
    "if the polygon is very small , the sum of the interior angles is larger than @xmath44 , since the metric ( [ rieman ] ) approaches a flat metric for @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "enlarging the polygon , the sum of the angles decreases until it is zero at a certain limit .",
    "( this is the limit when the polygon vertices lie on the border of the poincar disc on which ( [ rieman ] ) can also be defined by a proper coordinate transformation .",
    "the geodesics meet this border orthogonally and therefore the angle sum is zero ) . as @xmath55 is a continuous function of the distance of the vertices from the origin @xmath43",
    ", we deduce that the desired polygon indeedly exists .",
    "+ the next question which arises is that of the differentiability of the metric after the compactification .",
    "identifying geodesics assures that the metric is in @xmath56 .",
    "( use `` fermi coordinates '' @xcite in neighbourhoods of the geodesics which have to be identified . in these",
    "coordinates one has on the geodesics @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "as the second derivatives of the metric are bounded , the metric is even in @xmath59 ( which means that the first derivatives are hoelder continuous with exponent @xmath60 ) .",
    "now we note that one obtains the gaussian curvature @xmath47 by applying a quasilinear elliptic operator @xmath61 of second order to the metric @xmath62 , @xmath63.\\ ] ] @xmath61 can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the coordinates on the surface , @xmath66 is a multi  index , the coefficients @xmath67 are matrices , and @xmath68 .",
    "we now express the zeroeth and first derivatives of the metric in @xmath69 as functions of the coordinates @xmath65 .",
    "this makes the operator @xmath61 linear with coefficients in @xmath70 .",
    "as the gaussian curvature is also in @xmath70 on the compactified surface , we conclude from the regularity theorem for solutions of linear elliptic equations @xcite that the metric @xmath62 is ( at least ) in @xmath71 . +",
    "as we have compactified now the @xmath9-sector to a riemann surface @xmath72 , the topology of the manifold is that of @xmath73 .",
    "+ finally , we remark that ( [ diet1 ] ) is a limit case of the metric of plebanski and demianski @xcite , which is the most general known petrov type - d solution of the source - free einstein - maxwell equations with cosmological constant . in the case of zero electric and magnetic charge",
    "it reads @xmath74 where the structure functions are given by @xmath75 @xmath3 is the cosmological constant , @xmath7 and @xmath76 are the mass and nut parameters , respectively , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are further real parameters .",
    "( for details c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . rescaling the coordinates and the constants according to @xmath79 and taking the limit as @xmath80 , one obtains @xmath81",
    "where now @xmath82 setting now @xmath83 one gets our solution ( [ diet1 ] ) . as we said , the metric ( [ diet1 ] ) results to be a limit case of the more general solution ( [ pd ] ) of einstein s equation .",
    "this formally shows that ( [ diet1 ] ) should solve einstein s field equations with cosmological constant , i.e. the analytical continuation ( [ ancon ] ) of the kerr - de sitter metric should yield again a solution .",
    "anyhow , one could doubt of the procedure as it involves an infinite limit of some parameters in the initial solution of einstein s equations .",
    "therefore , let us sketch a short independent proof of the fact that ( [ diet1 ] ) still satisfies einstein s equations .",
    "+ generally speaking , all functions which appear in the left hand side of einstein s equations containing the cosmological constant are polynomial in metric tensor components , components of the inverse metric tensor and derivatives of metric tensor components . considering all these functions as independent variables ,",
    "the l.h.s of einstein s equations defines analytic functions in these variables .",
    "let us consider kerr - de sitter spacetime defined above .",
    "then the metric , its inverse and its derivatives define locally analytic functions of the ( generally complex ) variables @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude that the l.h.s of einstein s equations defines analytic functions of @xmath85 in open connected domains away from singularities corresponding to zeroes of @xmath86 and the determinant of the analitically continued metric ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we know that , for real values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , these functions vanish because kerr - de sitter metric is a solution of einstein s equations .",
    "hence , due to the theorem of uniqueness of the analytical continuation of a function of several complex variables , they must vanish concerning all ( generally complex ) remaining values of @xmath85 , provided they belong to the same domain of analyticity of the previously considered real values .",
    "in particular , we can pick out the set of values determining the metric ( [ diet1 ] ) as final values .",
    "notice that these values belong to the same analyticity domain of the values determining kerr - de sitter metric because one can easily find piecewise smooth trajectories in the space @xmath90 , connecting kerr - de sitter parameters to parameters appearing in the metric ( [ diet1 ] ) , and skipping all singularities .",
    "we shall briefly discuss now the black hole interpretation of the proposed solutions and some of their physical properties , starting with the case @xmath2 .",
    "let us begin by looking at the curvature of the spacetime metric ( [ diet1 ] ) .",
    "the only nonvanishing complex tetrad component of the weyl tensor is given by @xmath91 ( the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , are the standard complex tetrad components describing the conformal curvature . for details",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . for @xmath94 the weyl tensor vanishes and , since @xmath95 , our manifold is a space of constant curvature , @xmath96 , i.e. a quotient space of the universal covering of anti - de sitter space .",
    "this situation is comparable to that of the kerr metric , which , for vanishing mass parameter , is simply the minkowsky metric written in oblate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "+ one further observes that @xmath97 is always nonsingular , in particular the curvature singularity in kerr - de sitter space at @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 vanishes after the analytical continuation , as @xmath100 is always positive .",
    "hence the manifold may be extended to values @xmath101 , and closed timelike curves will always be present .",
    "this is similar to the btz black hole @xcite , where no curvature singularity occurs ( see also @xcite for an exhaustive determination of @xmath102-black holes and their topology ) . on the other hand all non rotating solutions with @xmath103 found",
    "so far have curvature singularities at the origin , but do not violate the strong causality condition .",

    "as we will see , the situation will be rather different for toroidal black holes , which behave quite similarly to the kerr solution .",

    "what we get is the very simple result @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the horizon area .",
    "@xmath7 can be expressed as a function of the outermost horizon location @xmath160 , by using @xmath236 .",
    "thus @xmath7 really is related to the hamiltonian mass , albeit in a relative sense .",

    "indeed , we obtain the trivial result that @xmath237 , if the background has the same rotation parameter but different @xmath7 .",
    "thus all solutions with equal @xmath22 have the same quasi - local energy .",
    "+ concerning the angular momentum we are in a different position , since there is no global rotational killing symmetry .",
    "however the vector @xmath238 , although it is not a killing vector , obeys locally the condition @xmath239 and is therefore a kind of approximate symmetry , we could say a locally exact symmetry . we may try to compute @xmath240 using eq .",

    "this is weakly conserved in the sense that it depends on the choice of a spatial slice in the three - boundary at infinity . due to these facts ,",
    "the `` first law '' and the full subject of black hole thermodynamics needs here further clarifications . in this connection",
    ", one should use a kind of quasi - local formalism for black hole thermodynamics , along the lines of brown et al .",
    "@xcite for asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes .",

    "physically , in this case @xmath245 and the horizon does not rotate relative to the stationary observers at infinity .",
    "we discuss now another black hole solution in anti - de sitter gravity which represents a rotating torus hidden by an event horizon .",
    "the first solution of this kind has been discovered by lemos and zanchin @xcite by compactifying a charged open black string .",
    "this is a solution that can be obtained from the non rotating toroidal metric by mixing time - angle variables into new ones .",
    "this is not a permissible coordinate transformation in the large , as angles , unlike time , are periodic variables .",
    "this is why the solutions one obtains are globally different , as clearly showed by stachel while investigating the gravitational analogue of the aharanov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "+ the metric we shall present can not be obtained by forbidden coordinate mixing , but it can be obtained from the general petrov type-@xmath0 solution already presented by a simple choice of parameters . by requiring the existence of the non - rotating solution ( which we know to exist ) and the time inversion symmetry , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , we get the following metric tensor @xmath248 where @xmath249 is a periodic variable with some period @xmath250 , @xmath251 is another angular variable with period @xmath44 and @xmath252 @xmath253 finally , the angular velocity and the lapse are given by , respectively @xmath254 the solution is obtained as a limit case of the plebanski - demianski metric by setting @xmath255 , @xmath256 and rescaling @xmath257 ( this last to have the limit @xmath258 ) .",
    "+ the metric induced on the spacelike two - surfaces at some constant @xmath32 and @xmath33 is then @xmath259 as long as @xmath35 , this is a well defined metric on a cylinder , but as it stands it can not be defined on the torus which one gets identifying some value of @xmath249 , say @xmath260 , with @xmath261 .",
    "this is because the components of the metric are even , rational functions of @xmath249 but have unequal derivatives at @xmath262 .",
    "thus we need to cover @xmath263 with four coordinate patches , and set @xmath264 in a neighborhood of @xmath199 and @xmath265 and @xmath266 in a neighborhood of @xmath267 and @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is a constant needed to match the length of the circle to the chosen value @xmath250 . on the overlap",
    "@xmath270 is a @xmath271 function of @xmath272 and viceversa , so now the metric is well defined and smooth on a torus . + even on the cylinder , the metric ( [ torobh ] ) represents a rotating cylindrical black hole not isometric to the one discussed by lemos @xcite or santos @xcite , which are stationary generalizations of the general static cylindrical solution found by linet @xcite .",
    "thus in this case we have not a unique solution , but rather a many - parameter family of stationary , locally static metrics .",
    "this was to be expected as whenever the first betti number of a static manifold is non vanishing , there exists in general a many - parameter family of locally static , stationary solutions of einstein s equations , a fact which can be regarded as a gravitational analogue of the aharanov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "+ we shall study now the metric ( [ torobh ] ) for @xmath273 . notice the symmetry under the combined inversion @xmath157 , @xmath274 .",
    "the metric coefficients are functions of @xmath275 and @xmath249 is identified independently of @xmath251 .",
    "therefore the metric has a global rotational symmetry ( unlike the higher genus solutions ) and is stationary .",
    "we shall consider mostly the region @xmath276 which has a black hole interpretation and is the physically relevant region for black holes forming by collapse .",
    "anyhow , the metric ( [ torobh ] ) admits a sensible continuation to @xmath125 .",
    "the event horizons arise from the zeroes of @xmath86 . in the case",
    "@xmath273 that we are considering , all zeroes may appear in the region @xmath277 only ( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) for the causal structure in the non extreme case ) . considering the metric ( [ torobh ] ) , one finds that there is a critical value , @xmath278 , for the rotation parameter @xmath22 , such that for @xmath279 the solution is a naked singularity . for @xmath280",
    "there are two positive first order roots , @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath281 , which coalesce at the second order root @xmath282 when @xmath283 .",
    "this critical value is @xmath284 the event horizon is located at the larger value @xmath110 , and has a surface gravity @xmath285 the surface gravity vanishes when @xmath283 and the metric describes an extreme black hole ( see fig .  ( 5 ) ) . finally , there is a curvature singularity at @xmath286 , namely at @xmath287 .",
    "as a point set at fixed time , this is @xmath288 , where @xmath289 are the two points on the torus at @xmath165 which correspond to @xmath290 , and looks like a pair of disjoint ring singularities .",
    "another point of interest is that @xmath291 and @xmath292 in a neighborhood of @xmath165 .",
    "therefore the torus turns into a lorentzian submanifold with @xmath251 becoming a timelike coordinate .",
    "evidently there are closed timelike curves around the origin .",
    "as we can see , the situation is quite similar to the kerr metric , except that the euler characteristic of the horizon now vanishes . to check this , notice that the metric on the horizon is , locally @xmath293 this metric",
    "can be written in conformally flat form by factoring out the @xmath294-component , which is smooth and positive .",
    "the conformal metric has @xmath295 and it turns out to be flat .",
    "the actual metric is thus conformally flat and defined on a compact domain .",
    "the scalar curvature of a conformally flat manifold is a total divergence and vanishes when integrated over a closed manifold .",
    "therefore the euler characteristic vanishes and the horizon , which we assumed to be compact and orientable , must be a torus .",
    "furthermore , by rescaling the metric with a constant parameter @xmath296 , we can see that the periods scale as @xmath297 , @xmath298 . therefore it is the ratio of the periods that is conformally invariant .",
    "this ratio determines the conformal class of the torus and is the analogue of the more familiar teichmller parameter .",
    "+ since all surfaces at constant @xmath32 take on the topology of a torus , @xmath299 , the topology of the external region ( the domain of outer communication in carter s language ) is that of @xmath300 . + finally , few comments on the presence of ergoregions are in order .",
    "consideration of the metric ( [ torobh ] ) lead us to @xmath301 > from this expression , we see that @xmath302 within the regions where @xmath303 .",
    "conversely , within regions where @xmath304 , outside the external horizon in particular , @xmath192 may change its sign becoming positive for @xmath196 sufficiently small and negative for large @xmath196 .",
    "in fact , as in the previously considered case , ergotori appear within the regions @xmath305 .",
    "in particular , this happens outside the outermost event horizon .",
    "ergoregions , where both @xmath173 and @xmath114 are space - like , are bounded by event horizons and the surfaces at @xmath197 , given by the implicit equation @xmath306 differently from the previously examined class of topological rotating black holes , surfaces at @xmath197 and horizons do not meet in the case of a toroidal rotating black hole .",
    "indeed , surfaces at @xmath197 , in the region outside the external horizon fill the interval @xmath307 $ ] where @xmath308 and @xmath309 is the positive root of @xmath310 .",

    "the hamiltonian mass of the given spacetime , relative to the background solution with toroidal topology but @xmath315 , can be computed by carefully handling the divergent terms appearing when the boundary of spacetime is pushed to spatial infinity .",
    "also , the killing observers at infinity relative to which the mass is measured , have a residual , @xmath249-dependent angular velocity @xmath316 and this also must be taken into account .",
    "all calculations done , we get a conserved mass @xmath225 and a conserved angular momentum @xmath240 according to @xmath317 giving to @xmath22 the expected meaning .",
    "as @xmath22 is bounded from above by @xmath278 , in order for the solution to have a black hole interpretation , we see that the angular momentum is bounded by a power @xmath318 of the mass .",
    "we have presented a class of exact solutions of einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant , having many of the features which are characteristics of black holes .",
    "all these solutions are of petrov - type @xmath0 and the horizons , when they exist , have the topology of riemann surfaces and therefore they lack rotational symmetry for genus @xmath2 . among the solutions there is also a toroidal black hole , still different from the lemos - zanchin solution .",
