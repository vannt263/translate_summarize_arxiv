    "standardised multiple - choice tests can be used as a tool in physics education to assess student learning .",
    "a number of such tests have been developed covering a range of different domains in physics .",
    "one of the most commonly used test , the force concept inventory ( fci ) , was introduced by hestenes , wells and swackhamer @xcite .",
    "fci has since then been used as a tool in assessing the efficiency of a number of developed teaching methods ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "fci is limited to the understanding of the concept of force , but an increased understanding of force should work as a more general indication of learning in mechanics as a whole .",
    "considering the extended use of fci , it should also work as a tool in assessing the learning of norwegian students in their introduction physics courses . in order to investigate the reliability and discrimination power of fci at a norwegian university",
    ", a number of statistical tests focusing both on individual items and on the test as a whole , has been performed .",
    "there exist two aspects of test reliability ; consistency and discriminatory power .",
    "a test is said to be reliable if it is consistent within itself and over time .",
    "if a test is shown to be reliable , one can assume that the same students would get the same score if they would take the test again after a period of time . a large variance in the test score of a reliable test",
    "will then depend on a systematic variation in the student population , where different levels of understanding or mastery will give different scores on the test .",
    "both these aspects of test reliability can be assessed statistically . in order to evaluate the reliability of the fci in a norwegian context ,",
    "the test was administrated to different student groups at the norwegian university of science and technology ( ntnu ) in trondheim . even if the test is intended to be of general use",
    ", the level of the students understanding or mastery will affect the usefulness of the test , especially when the group has a higher degree of understanding or mastery .",
    "a concept inventory is a criterion - referenced test designed to evaluate if students have an accurate knowledge of a specific set of concepts within a defined area .",
    "concept inventories are typically organized as multiple - choice tests in order to ensure that they are objectively scored in a reproducible manner and possible to administrate in large classes . unlike a teacher - made multiple - choice test ,",
    "questions and response choices in concept inventories are a subject of extensive research and development .",
    "the aims of the research may include ascertaining ( a ) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and ( b ) the most common responses to the questions . in the concept inventory ,",
    "each question includes one correct answer and several distractors .",
    "the distractors are incorrect answers that are usually ( but not always ) based on students commonly held misconceptions .",
    "ideally , the scores should reflect the amount of content knowledge students has mastered .",
    "the purpose of a criterion - referenced test is to ascertain whether students master a predetermined amount of content knowledge .",
    "the distractors are often based on ideas commonly held by students , as determined by years of research on misconceptions .",
    "the force concept inventory ( fci ) @xcite is a multiple - choice test , designed to assess student understanding of the most basic concepts in newtonian physics , particular forces .",
    "the test has 30 questions covering six areas of understanding : kinematics , newton s first , second , and third laws , the superposition principle , and types of forces ( such as gravitation , friction ) .",
    "each question has only one correct newtonian answer , with distractors based on student s common misconceptions .",
    "a low score indicates that the student has an aristotelian view while a high score ( typically around 60% correct or higher ) indicates a newtonian understanding .",
    "the norwegian version of fci used , was translated and developed by angell and collaborators at university of oslo @xcite .",
    "the test was given in three different courses with different student groups , both as a pre-(instruction ) and post-(instruction ) test in the fall semester 2012 .",
    "the courses were traditional calculus - based introductory physics courses .",
    "as all engineering students at ntnu have to take at least one course in physics , it was possible to administer fci to both physics masters and non - physics masters .",
    "however , different physics courses are given to different masters programs , but all courses contain about the same amount of content relevant for the fci survey during lectures and are using the same textbook as the main source .",
    "the three groups consisted of students in different physics courses ; mechanical physics ( tfy4145/fy1001 ) for physics masters ; physics ( tfy4104 ) for master students in marine technology , industrial economics and technology management and mechanical engineering ; and physics ( tfy4115 ) for master students in electronics , engineering cybernetics and nanotechnology .",
    "it should also be noted that tfy4104 and tfy4115 include electromagnetics and thermodynamics , respectively , in addition to mechanics .",
    "the test was voluntary with no extra credit given .",
    "the numbers of students taking the tests are given in table [ tablekey1 ] .",
    "the result of the tests with respect to understanding will be presented elsewhere as we focus on the reliability of the test in this paper .",
    "the students in the different groups have a similar background , but one can assume that the physics masters has a more explicit interest and knowledge in physics and will subsequently score higher on the fci .",
    "the physics masters and nanotechnology students are generally believed to be high - achieving students as admission grades are higher compared with the other master programs .",
    "the physics masters and nanotechnology students are first year students while the others are second year students . by examining the results in the different groups it is possible to establish the reliability within each group . using the data from the individual groups we performed five statistical tests : three focusing on individual items ( item difficulty index , item discrimination index , item point biserial coefficient ) and two on the test a whole ( kuder - richardson test reliability and test ferguson s @xmath0 ) .",
    ".number of students taking the fci . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the reliability and discriminatory power of the force concept inventory has been evaluated using five statistical tests in three different student groups , both in pre - instructional and post - instructional tests , at the norwegian university of science and technology ( ntnu ) .",
    "the aim of this study was to test the applicability of the fci in different contexts , as made possible with physics majors and engineering students required to take at least one physics course at ntnu .",
    "we have found that the fci is reliable and discriminating enough for pre - tests in all student groups .",
    "the post - test for physics majors ( tfy4145 ) can not be considered as applicable in the present form for the full group , the average difficulty index ( 86% ) has reached a level where ceiling effects will cause problems .",
    "the average discrimination index , though still over the 0.3 level , is not a good indicator as half of the questions have a discrimination index below that level . a similar but not as serious problem",
    "can also be seen in the tfy4115 group . however , it is still possible to use the test for specific subgroups , that is low achieving students , in order to investigate their understanding .",
    "the force concept inventory is a widely used instrument , but as has been shown here , it can not be used without taking the context and student groups into account .",
    "used on a high - achieving group , there is a substantial risk of encountering ceiling effects , with a decrease in discriminatory power",
    ". it will still be useful for the students within this group that has not obtained an understanding of the fundamental concepts .",
    "questions 6 , 16 , 19 and 29 in the fci are somewhat problematic and might be replaced with other questions in a high - achieving group , such as tfy4145 .",
    "however , one might also consider constructing a special high - achieving fci suitable for physics majors ."
