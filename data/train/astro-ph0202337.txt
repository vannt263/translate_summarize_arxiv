    "according to the model now prevailing ( see piran 2000 ; mszros 2002 for recent reviews ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grb s ) originate from the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding fireball , caused by a cataclysmic collapse of a massive star or by a neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole merger event , leading to the acceleration of a plasma of electrons and protons to highly relativistic speed .",
    "part of the kinetic energy of the this expanding `` fireball '' is dissipated in `` internal '' collisions between different parts of the inhomogeneous ejecta , resulting in shocks which accelerate particles via the fermi process to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "the non thermal radiation from accelerated electrons reproduces well the observed mev @xmath6-ray spectra . at a later stage of the expansion , the fireball decelerates due to interaction with its surrounding medium .",
    "the relativistic shock wave driven into the ambient medium continuously accelerates new electrons of the surrounding gas , producing a long - term synchrotron `` afterglow '' emission .    although observations are in general agreement with model predictions ( see kulkarni et al .",
    "2000 for a recent review ) , the model is incomplete , and there are several open issues , which are not properly understood .",
    "one is that of the burst progenitor .",
    "several alternative models for the `` inner engine '' were suggested , such as ns - ns or ns - bh merger @xcite , and the gravitational collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present neither grb nor afterglow observations provide decisive evidence in support of a particular model .",
    "nevertheless , the environment may be a clue to the progenitor .",
    "thus , expansion into a relatively uniform inter - stellar medium ( ism ) with a number density @xmath8  @xmath9 would be a natural consequence of a `` merger '' scenario , whereas if the progenitor is a collapsing star , it is natural to expect a much higher ambient density due to a wind ejected by the star at earlier stages of its evolution .",
    "the `` onset '' of fireball interaction with surrounding medium , i.e. at the radius where fireball deceleration becomes significant , typically takes place on minute time scale ( in the observer frame ) following the burst , at which stage the density of wind plasma is @xmath10  @xmath9 . at present , afterglow observations typically begin several hours following the burst and do not allow to directly probe the onset of deceleration . since on a day time scale the fireball expands to a point where the wind density drops to values close to that typical for the ism , present observations do not provide clear discriminants between the wind and ism scenarios @xcite .    a second issue where basic understanding is still lacking is the physics of acceleration of electrons to high energies , and the build up of strong magnetic fields by the grb collisionless shock waves @xcite .",
    "the presence of high - energy electrons and strong magnetic fields is implied by observations , yet there is presently no theory based on first principles that satisfactorily explains electron coupling and magnetic field generation . the ignorance is usually parameterized by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which stand for the fractions of shock internal energy density which are carried by the relativistic electrons and by the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "efforts to constrain these parameters using afterglow observations are numerous , and @xmath11 is typically estimated to be close to its equipartition value , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "however , @xmath12 is not well constrained by observations , and its estimated values range from @xmath14 ( e.g. waxman 1997a ; wijers & galama 1998 ) to @xmath15 ( e.g. wijers & galama 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "1999 ; waxman & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "observations strongly suggest that the radiation emitted during the afterglow is synchrotron radiation .",
    "we show here that the modification of the refractive index , by the relativistic electrons and protons , may strongly affect the emission at radio wavelengths during the onset of fireball deceleration , if @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we find that , under plausible assumptions on the electron distribution function , the synchrotron reabsorption coefficient may become negative , thus leading to coherent emission from the fireball on minute time scale following the grb .",
    "these collective plasma processes strongly affect the synchrotron spectrum at frequencies @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ratio of plasma frequency and electron gyration frequency .    as mentioned above , currently there is a few hours gap between grb and afterglow observations .",
    "however , the ( operating ) hete - ii satellite and the swift satellite ( planned to be launched at 2003 ) may allow observations of early stages of fireball expansion , shortly after the grb , thus providing data on the onset of deceleration .",
    "we show below that observations of collective plasma effects in the emission from grb afterglows will serve to constrain the value of @xmath12 , as well as the parameters of the environment into which the fireball expands , thus providing a handle on both progenitor type and shock physics .",
    "collective plasma effects on synchrotron emission and reabsorption have been considered by many authors ( e.g. ginzburg & syrovatskii 1965 ; zheleznyakov 1967 ; yokun 1968 ; crusius & schlickeiser 1988 ) . analyses of effects due to a non - vacuum index of refraction are typically limited to the case where the index of refraction is determined by the presence of a non - relativistic plasma .",
    "these analyses do not apply to the grb plasma in which we are interested , where no `` cold '' non - relativistic plasma component is present .",
    "sazonov ( 1969 , 1970 , 1973 ) has studied the case of interest for us , where `` cold '' plasma is absent , and the effects are entirely due to the presence of the relativistic plasma .",
    "as we shall show , his results are too restrictive , as he infers negative reabsorption only in cases where @xmath19 , or in cases when the electron distribution function is very anisotropic .",
    "we find that these constraints might be eased , and that negative reabsorption is possible for isotropic distribution functions provided that @xmath20 , thus allowing coherent emission for grb plasma parameters .",
    "in  [ sec : vlasovtheory ] we derive the dispersion relation and the polarizations and refractive indices of normal modes in a highly relativistic , weakly magnetized ( @xmath21 ) plasma with isotropic electron and proton distribution functions .",
    "the frequency range discussed is @xmath22 , where the relativistic plasma may have a strong effect on synchrotron emission . in  [ sec : radiationprocesses ] we show that the plasma strongly affects synchrotron radiation at frequencies @xmath23 , which generalizes the razin - tsytovich frequency @xmath24 to a regime where @xmath25  the regime relevant for us .",
    "we note , that although @xmath24 is commonly quoted as the frequency below which plasma effects are strong , it is typically found in numerical analyses of non - relativistic plasmas that , for @xmath26 , synchrotron emission is strongly modified only at @xmath27 ( e.g. crusius & schlickeiser 1988 ) .",
    "we show in  [ sec : radiationprocesses ] that a more careful statement of the qualitative criterion , that leads to the conclusion that plasma effects are strong below @xmath24 ( e.g rybicki & lightman 1979 section 8.3 ) , leads directly to the result that ( for both relativistic and non - relativistic plasma ) such effects are important only below @xmath3 .",
    "our results are applied to grb plasmas in  [ sec : grbs ] . in  [ sec : grbphenomenologymodel ] we briefly describe grb and afterglow phenomenology , give a short review of the fireball model , and derive the plasma parameters during the onset of fireball deceleration , considering both expansion into a uniform - density ism (  [ sec : uniform ] ) , and expansion into a wind (  [ sec : wind ] ) .",
    "plasma effects are discussed in  [ sec : freqestimates ] .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we note , that coherent radio emission from grb s has recently been discussed by usov & katz @xcite .",
    "the scenario considered by these authors for grb production , the scattering of ambient medium electrons and protons by a magnetically dominated wind @xcite , is different , however , than the scenario we are considering , where observed radiation is produced ( both in grb and afterglow phases ) by the dissipation through collisionless shocks of fireball kinetic energy , leading to magnetic field amplification and to particle acceleration .",
    "the processes we consider are , thus , different than those considered by usov & katz ( 2000 ) , and the predicted radio emission is very different .",
    "for example , while usov & katz find power - law spectrum with strong emission at @xmath28  mhz for strong magnetic field , we find strong emission only for weak magnetic fields and over a narrow range of frequencies around @xmath29  ghz ( which is more readily observable ) .",
    "finally , we note that the analysis presented here is restricted to isotropic electron and proton distributions , and we show that strong plasma effects on synchrotron radiation occur if @xmath20 .",
    "we note however , that anisotropy may lead to further interesting effects , the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "as explained in the next chapter , it is the deviation of the speed at which light propagates in plasma from @xmath30 which is responsible for the plasma effects we consider .",
    "this implies that we must first obtain expressions for the refractive indices @xmath31 of the transversal electromagnetic modes in the plasma . in our derivation of the dispersion relation",
    "we restrict the discussion to plasmas under the following conditions  : ( i ) electrons are highly relativistic ; ( ii ) rough energy equipartition between protons and electrons ; ( iii ) isotropic particle distribution functions ; ( iv ) weak magnetization , @xmath21 .",
    "afterglow observations imply that ( i ) and ( ii ) hold for grb plasmas .",
    "( iii ) restricts the discussion to plasma effects originating from the deviation of the refracting indices from their vacuum values .",
    "our discussion is restricted to the weak magnetization case since , as shown in the next chapter , strong effects of the plasma on synchrotron emission are obtained for this case only .",
    "finally , we restrict the discussion to the frequency range affected by collective effects , @xmath32 .    the assumption @xmath21 allows a perturbative derivation ( in @xmath33 ) of the dispersion relation .",
    "moreover , in the frequency range @xmath32 , the deviation of the refractive index @xmath34 , from 1 is much larger than @xmath35 .",
    "this simplifies the dispersion relations obtained below , thus allowing analytic estimates .",
    "below we give order of magnitude estimates of the plasma frequency and the difference between the refractive indices of the transversal electromagnetic waves in a relativistic plasma .",
    "exact calculations are given in the appendix , and are used to verify the simple estimates .    as we show in  [ sec : fieldfreeplasma ] , the refractive indices of the transversal electromagnetic waves in a field - free plasma are degenerate , and satisfy approximately the relation @xmath36^{1/2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the plasma frequency of a relativistic plasma .",
    "this result is exact for monoenergetic electron and proton distributions , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the associated lorentz factors of the two species , respectively .",
    "detailed calculations show , however , that the above result is a good approximation to the plasma frequency also for more general energy distributions . for a power - law energy distribution implied by afterglow observations , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , replacing @xmath42 with @xmath43 in equation ( [ eq : plasmafrequency ] ) gives the plasma frequency with accuracy of 1% .",
    "note , that equation ( [ eq : plasmafrequency ] ) is a natural generalization to the relativistic regime of the familiar expression for the plasma frequency , obtained by replacing the particle mass @xmath44 with @xmath45 . since we assume that the energy of the electrons and protons is approximately equipartitioned , the contributions of the two species to @xmath37 are comparable .",
    "once an external magnetic field @xmath46 is introduced , the plasma can not be regarded as isotropic any longer , and the degeneracy of the two refractive indices is removed . for frequencies",
    "@xmath47 the effect of the magnetized plasma on the propagating radiation is small , and the electric field can be assumed to be approximately transversal to the direction of propagation , i.e. @xmath48 . in the appendix (  [ sec : weaklymagnetizedplasma ] ) we derive the dispersion relation for the waves of transversal electric field . in order to obtain estimates of the refractive indices of the transversal",
    "em modes , we solve the vlasov equation of a relativistic plasma with isotropic electron and proton distribution functions .",
    "the assumption of weak magnetization allows a perturbative expansion of the equation , where the perturbations in the particle distribution functions are assumed to be linear in the external magnetic field , ( i.e. , the expansion parameter is @xmath33 ) .",
    "this leads to a significant simplification of the formalism .",
    "the dispersion relation for the components of the transversal electric fields is given by  : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radian frequency of the wave , @xmath51 is the wave - number , and @xmath52 is the @xmath53 dielectric tensor .",
    "the refractive indices @xmath54 of the plasma are the square roots of the eigenvalues of this equation .",
    "detailed numerical calculations showed that the values obtained for the components of the dielectric tensor and the resultant refractive indices are not sensitive to the exact shape of the electron and proton energy distribution functions .",
    "specifically , we showed that simple expressions obtained for monoenergetic distribution functions ( which are the estimates used below ) are good approximations of the more cumbersome expressions obtained for power law distributions .",
    "the deviation from degeneracy of the two refractive indices is the consequence of the non - diagonal terms of the dielectric tensor , which are proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the angle between the wave - vector @xmath57 and the external magnetic field @xmath46 [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon11 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon12 ] )  ] .",
    "hence the deviation is largest for radiation propagating along the magnetic field ( @xmath58 ) , and vanishes when the direction of propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : epsilon11_deltafunction_fieldfree ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon12_deltafunction ] ) , describing the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor , can be used to estimate the difference between the two refractive indices . for the frequencies in which we are interested @xmath60 is larger , or at least comparable to @xmath61 .",
    "this simplifies the algebra immensely . since we assume that the widths of the electron and proton distribution functions are close , and that energy density in the protons and electrons is approximately equipartitioned , the contributions of the two species to @xmath62 are comparable .",
    "hence , an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath63 is  : @xmath64 up to a factor of order  1 .",
    "the result @xmath65 is a consequence of the fact that our derivation keeps only terms which are linear in the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath66 order terms in @xmath33 .",
    "if this assumption is eased , and the refractive indices of the ordinary and extra - ordinary modes are used to estimate @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "as will be shown in the next chapter , the frequency at which the plasma has a significant effect on the synchrotron emission is @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that for plasma parameters of interest to us ( @xmath70 ) the logarithmic factor in equation ( [ eq : delta_n ] ) is of order 10 .",
    "hence we replace equation ( [ eq : delta_n ] ) with an expression which takes into account the finite @xmath63 at perpendicular propagation  : @xmath71 , & otherwise.\\cr           } \\ ] ]    we solved the dispersion relation [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon11_deltafunction_fieldfree ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon12_deltafunction ] ) ] numerically , for two values of @xmath72 ( 920 and @xmath73 ) , and for three values of @xmath33 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 )",
    ". these values of @xmath72 and @xmath33 are representative of typical values for grb afterglow plasmas ( see  [ sec : grbs ] ) . in these calculations we assumed a propagation angle @xmath76 .",
    "the results agree with the estimate ( [ eq : delta_n_revised ] ) up to a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "the numerical calculation also confirmed that for parameters in the ranges relevant for grb afterglows , the discrepancy between the refractive indices of the transversal modes is small in comparison to the deviation of either of them from unity , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "when the radiation propagates parallel to the magnetic field , the squared refractive indices of the two normal modes may be described by the well - known expressions @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the gyration frequencies of electrons and protons in the magnetic field , and @xmath81 are the relativistic plasma frequencies of the two species , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to compare our estimate in equation ( [ eq : delta_n_revised ] ) to the difference @xmath82 obtained from equation ( [ eq : nrnl_fluidplasma ] ) .",
    "when exact equipartition is assumed , and both the protons and the electrons are mono - energetically distributed , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , whence @xmath85 .",
    "this degeneracy is removed if equipartition is not exactly satisfied , or if the widths of the distribution functions of the two species are different .",
    "since both effects are expected to be important in the case of our interest , we will use equation ( [ eq : delta_n_revised ] ) as an estimate for @xmath63 .",
    "our calculations imply that non - diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor are smaller than its diagonal elements by a factor of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "the latter , however , are independent of the magnetic field , and thus are identical to the values we obtained for a field - free plasma [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon11 ] ) ] . as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : radiationprocesses ] , the difference between the refractive indices of the transversal modes is important for determining the polarization of the modes and thus for the calculation of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "however , our estimate of the frequency at which plasma effects on synchrotron emission become significant is not sensitive to @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , as far as estimating the frequency @xmath87 is concerned , we will use the approximation given in equation ( [ eq : plasmafrequency ] ) .",
    "the detailed expressions we obtained ( in the appendix ) for the elements of the @xmath53 dielectric tensor @xmath52 , show that @xmath88 and @xmath89 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon11_deltafunction_fieldfree ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon12_deltafunction ] ) ] .",
    "the assumption of transversality thus implies that the normal modes are always circularly polarized ( clockwise and anti - clockwise ) . to check the consistency of our assumption of quasi - transversality , and to obtain the ( elliptical ) polarization of the two quasi - transversal modes , we calculated the eigenmodes of the full @xmath90 dielectric tensor .",
    "following the method outlined in  [ sec : fieldfreeplasma ] [ and described in the paragraph preceding eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersionrel_temp ] ) ] , it is straightforward ( yet lengthy ) to obtain expressions for the other elements of @xmath52 with @xmath91 , and _ without _ assuming transversality .",
    "it is possible to show that these extra elements contribute an additional term to @xmath63 , which is smaller than the value obtained from the transversal calculation by a factor of @xmath92 at small and mildly oblique propagation angles , and becomes comparable to @xmath93 $ ] , as @xmath94 approaches @xmath95 .",
    "numerical calculation of the plasma normal modes confirmed that for plasma parameters of interest to us ( @xmath96 ) the normal modes are indeed transverse to the direction of propagation , and are left- and right- circularly polarized .",
    "the spectral characteristics of synchrotron emission by a single relativistic electron are determined by the beaming of the radiation emitted by the electron into a narrow cone about the instantaneous direction of the electron s motion .",
    "when the electron is in a vacuum , the opening angle of this cone depends on the electron s lorentz factor and the frequency of the radiation .",
    "three regimes should be considered : when the frequency of interest is higher than the characteristic synchrotron frequency @xmath97 the cone s opening angle is @xmath98 , and when @xmath99 , one obtains the familiar result @xmath100 ; if , however , the frequency of interest is much smaller than @xmath97 , one obtains @xmath101 .",
    "next we consider an electron which is embedded in a dielectric medium with a refractive index @xmath102 .",
    "since the speed of light is now @xmath103 , the opening angle of the cone is @xmath104^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath105 , @xmath106^{1/2}$ ] for frequencies @xmath107 , and @xmath108^{1/2}$ ] for frequencies much smaller than @xmath97 .",
    "when the dielectric medium is a plasma , we use @xmath109 . a strong deviation from the vacuum behavior",
    "occurs when the second term @xmath110 is comparable to the first term in the square brackets .",
    "using @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the gyration frequency of the electron , we obtain an expression for the frequency at which the plasma collective effects greatly influence the synchrotron emission  : @xmath113 the _ razin - tsytovich _",
    "frequency @xmath114 is usually given as an estimate to the frequency below which the plasma strongly affects synchrotron radiation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : razinfrequency1 ] ) shows that this estimate is not generally valid .",
    "we are interested in the regime @xmath115 , hence for plasma parameters prevailing in grb afterglows the frequency at which the plasma greatly affects the synchrotron radiation is @xmath116 .",
    "it is simple to show that the definition of the plasma frequency [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : plasmafrequency ] ) ] implies that @xmath117 , where @xmath118 . typically @xmath119 .",
    "thus @xmath120    an immediate consequence of equation ( [ eq : nu_r * ] ) is that for the effect to be apparent we must have @xmath121 ( or , equivalently , @xmath122 ) .",
    "sazonov ( 1970 ) also considered the effects of a relativistic plasma on synchrotron emission .",
    "however , he considered only a situation in which @xmath123 , which led him to infer that negative synchrotron reabsorption is possible only for @xmath124 , or equivalently , if @xmath125 .",
    "the result ( [ eq : nu_r * ] ) shows that this condition is far too restrictive .",
    "however , as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : freqestimates ] , for the effects to be within the detection range of current radio telescopes , we must have @xmath126 .      all the information regarding the response of the plasma to electromagnetic waves ( e.g. modes propagating through the plasma , loss and gain , etc . )",
    "is contained in the dielectric tensor .",
    "specifically , the strong effect of plasma on synchrotron radiation is a manifestation of the deviation of the refractive index from 1 , that is the non - trivial ( i.e. `` non - vacuum '' ) structure of the dielectric tensor .",
    "the expression derived in the appendix for the dielectric tensor is not complete , i.e. it does not include self - absorption , since we treat the magnetic field perturbatively .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining a complete expression for the dielectric tensor requires solving a kinetic equation for the plasma , a process which may be avoided by introducing the method of _",
    "einstein coefficients_. the application of this method requires that over the length - scale of the wave phenomenon ( i.e. the wavelength ) , the absorption does not change the wave characteristics considerably . indeed ,",
    "since we do not obtain the dielectric tensor explicitly , we do not know _ a priori _ the em modes which can propagate through the plasma .",
    "we must assume , however , that whatever these modes are , the modifications introduced to the dielectric tensor due to the presence of the plasma are dominated by the deviation of the refractive indices from unity , and not by the absorption , that is  : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the wavelength , and @xmath129 denotes the mode .",
    "when condition ( [ eq : consistencycondition1 ] ) is not satisfied one must use a kinetic - equation approach , to self - consistently derive a dispersion relation which incorporates the self - absorption .",
    "since the refractive index depends on the radiation mode under consideration , we now have to determine the modes relevant to the frequency range we are interested in .",
    "motivated by the insight that in `` vacuum '' absorption is present , and the two transversal modes share the same refractive index ( i.e. , 1 ) , whereas , on the other hand , the result obtained above ( see  [ sec : vlasovtheory ] ) , shows that when absorption is neglected one obtains a finite @xmath130 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_n_revised ] ) ] , we conclude that the question of determining the relevant modes is resolved by considering whether the following inequality holds  : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the synchrotron self - absorption coefficient , and @xmath133 the wavelength of radiation .",
    "when condition ( [ eq : isotropyconsistencycondition ] ) is satisfied , the normal waves are linearly polarized along and perpendicular to the projection of the magnetic field on the plane of observation @xcite .",
    "we denote these polarizations by @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively . the power emitted by a single electron",

    "if , however , condition ( [ eq : isotropyconsistencycondition ] ) is not satisfied , one can not neglect the difference between the refractive indices of the normal modes .",
    "we are thus required to consider the two normal modes of the plasma , discussed previously in  [ sec : vlasovtheory ] .",

    "[ sec : synchrotronpolarization ] .",
    "if the frequencies of interest are higher than @xmath3 , the emission does not differ greatly from the emission in vacuum .",
    "however , for frequencies @xmath143 the emitted power is dramatically suppressed for both polarization regimes .",
    "this suppression is usually called the _ razin _ effect .",
    "our calculation of the synchrotron self - absorption coefficient @xmath144 implements the einstein relations between emission and absorption coefficients .",
    "these relations relate the emission and absorption coefficients of photons having a specific polarization state , or , to put it in terms of the previous chapter  a specific mode propagating through the plasma , which we shall denote by @xmath145 .",
    "hence also the expression for the self - absorption coefficient is for a specific mode @xcite  : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the power of @xmath148polarized photons emitted by an electron with energy @xmath149 .",
    "negative contributions to reabsorption come only from regions where the electron distribution function grows faster than @xmath150 . indeed ,",
    "if the distribution function has regions which are `` steep '' enough , the self - absorption coefficient becomes negative at low frequencies ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "this corresponds to stimulated emission from the plasma , and radiation is coherently amplified as it propagates .",
    "for this reason the effect is sometimes known as a _ maser _ effect .    in order to estimate the `` amplitude '' of the negative self - absorption",
    ", we take the electron distribution to be mono - energetic . substituting @xmath152 in equation ( [ eq : synchrotronselfabsorption ] ) , and using the fact that we are interested in frequencies @xmath153",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath154 where @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "the function @xmath157 has a global minimum at approximately @xmath87 , and its minimal value is @xmath158 . substituting @xmath159 , we obtain an estimate of the minimal value of the synchrotron self - absorption  : @xmath160 up to a factor of order unity .",
    "we can now use the estimate of the absorption coefficient obtained above to check the self - consistency of our calculation .",
    "namely , we shall show that in the frequency range of interest , the deviation from unity of the refractive indices dominates the absorption , thus facilitating the validity of implementation of the einstein coefficient method , as required by the consistency condition ( [ eq : consistencycondition1 ] ) . in  [ sec",
    ": fieldfreeplasma ] we showed that the refractive indices may be approximated by @xmath161 .",
    "hence , for @xmath162function distributions , equation ( [ eq : consistencycondition1 ] ) may be re - written as @xmath163 .",
    "since we are interested in frequencies of order of @xmath164 , this condition is casted to @xmath165 , which is always satisfied for typical afterglow parameters ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "next we determine the polarization of the synchrotron modes in the frequency range of interest for us .",
    "we use the estimate ( [ eq : delta_n_revised ] ) for @xmath63 , and substitute equation ( [ eq : min_alpha ] ) for the _ rhs _ of the inequality ( [ eq : isotropyconsistencycondition ] ) with negative reabsorption . after some algebra",

    "[ sec : negativereabsorption ] , a necessary condition for negative reabsorption is a region which grows faster than @xmath150 in the electron distribution function .",
    "we give here a plausible mechanism which may be responsible for the existence of such a region .",
    "relativistic shock waves are thought to accelerate electrons in such a way that the electron distribution function has a power - law tail extending to high energies . however , there is no satisfactory theory which predicts the shape of the distribution function at low energies .",
    "we thus assume that at low energies the distribution function has the simplest possible behavior , and electrons distribute according to the volume they occupy in phase - space , i.e. @xmath241 . by emitting synchrotron radiation , the electrons gradually lose their energy , and accumulate at lower energies , thus leading to a distribution function which grows faster than @xmath150 at low energies .",
    "the excess of electrons above the @xmath150 power law is sensitively dependent on the details of the distribution function injected by the shock .",

    "it must be borne in mind , though , that electrons which are `` injected '' to the hot plasma by the shock at later times have less time to cool .",
    "this leads , in principal , to a significant complication in the distribution function of the shock - accelerated electrons , since the further away from the shock front we look , the `` colder '' the distribution is , and in general , we can not consider the distribution function of the shocked plasma to be homogeneous . in particular , in regions closest to the shock front ,",
    "where the electrons had very little time to cool , compared to the dynamical time , the reabsorption is positive , and thus may obscure coherent emission from regions further away from the shock front .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown numerically that these regions contribute an optical depth of order of few , at most , for typical afterglow parameters ; hence the effect of inhomogeneity does not change qualitatively the phenomenon of coherent emission by the relativistic plasma . furthermore ,",
    "if one assumes some turbulent mechanism which acts on the dynamical time scale of the system , and `` mixes '' electron populations which were injected by the shock at different times , one may disregard that complication , and treat the `` averaged distribution '' function .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a major effect exists even when the low - energy electrons are distributed as @xmath242  ! indeed",
    ", there is no negative reabsorption in this case , since @xmath247 requires a region steeper than @xmath150 in the distribution function .",

    "two expansion scenarios were considered  : ( i ) a blast wave into a uniform - density ism with @xmath286  @xmath9 , where we expect a plasma collective effect on synchrotron emission from the gas heated by the forward shock at @xmath287  mhz ; ( ii ) expansion into a wind , where the number density decreases as @xmath288 , and at the radius at which the dynamics becomes self - similar is @xmath289  @xmath9 . in this case we predict a plasma effect on synchrotron emission from the wind accelerated by the forward shock at @xmath290  ghz [ see eqs .",

    "note that plasma collective effects on synchrotron emission below @xmath3 are expected irrespective of the details of the electron distribution function .",
    "this is in contrast to negative reabsorption and the maser effect , which require a region in the electron distribution function which rises faster than @xmath150 .",
    "the energy distribution of electrons produced by collisionless shock acceleration is not well known , in particular at low energy .",
    "however , we have shown that for plausible assumptions on the electron distribution function at low energy , synchrotron cooling of the electrons may lead to negative reabsorption .",
    "this , however , depends on the details of the distribution function near its peak .",
    "we have demonstrated negative reabsorption for a distribution which transforms smoothly ( at @xmath291 ) from a @xmath150 power - law at low energies to a @xmath292 power - law at high energies , for a certain range of parameters ( figure [ fig : results ] _ right _ ) .",
    "one should notice , however , that even if the distribution function permits negative reabsorption , coherent emission from plasma accelerated by a reverse shock may be completely obscured by the high optical depth of the ambient medium heated by the forward shock .",
    "thus , for example , when the fireball expands into a wind , certain electron distribution functions may lead to coherent emission from the reverse shock at 1.2  ghz [ eq .",

    "note , however , that if turbulent processes disrupt the shock fronts , so that `` bulges '' of accelerated ejecta lie in front of the forward shell along the line of sight , the plasma effects occurring in the reverse shock may become observable .",
    "our calculations of coherent emission assumed a homogeneous distribution function in the emitting shell .",
    "however , we have numerically shown that even if inhomogeneity due to different cooling times is taken into account , coherent emission would still be observable  : the regions close to the shock front , where the electrons have little time to cool , contribute only a positive optical depth of order of few , hence do not obscure completely the maser emission from regions further away from the shock front .",
    "we have shown that for typical plasma parameters the normal waves propagating in the plasma are circularly polarized at frequencies of order of @xmath3 [ see the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ eq : isotropyconsistencycondition ] ) and  [ sec : synchrotronpolarization ] ] . since the difference between the refractive indices of the transversal normal modes is smaller by a factor of @xmath294 than @xmath295 , and it is the latter which enter the equations of reabsorption and determine the amplification of radiation in both polarizations , the resulting optical depths corresponding to radiation in the two polarizations differ by a factor of a few , at most , if the magnetic field is assumed to be constant throughout the emitting shell .",
    "this factor is expected to reduce , due to saturation of emitted radiation .",
    "if , however , the direction of the magnetic field is assumed to fluctuate randomly on length - scales smaller than the shell s width , the difference between the two refractive indices also changes signs randomly , and the difference in the amplifications of the two polarization is averaged out .",
    "consequently , we do not expect the observed radiation to have a high degree of circular polarization at relevant frequencies .",
    "a detection of a strong effect in the radio - band at early stages of the afterglow will place a new independent constraint on the value of @xmath12 , as it will prove that it must be much smaller than 1 .",
    "since there is a two orders of magnitude difference between our estimates of @xmath3 in the forward shock in the two expansion scenarios , a flash in radio wave - band during early afterglow stages seems more probable when the fireball expands into a wind . in this respect ,",
    "plasma collective effects may serve as an important clue to the grb environment and progenitor type .",

    "since the rate of binary collisions is much smaller than the frequencies of interest for us , the plasma may be adequately described by a collisionless vlasov equation  : @xmath296 where the one - particle distribution function @xmath297 is defined as the fractional density of particles of a single type in phase space , and @xmath298 denotes a single species of particles , i.e. electrons or protons .",
