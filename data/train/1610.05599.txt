    "according to the big bang theory , the universe has been expanding and cooling . during its expansion , the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries leads the universe to a series of phase transitions . in most interesting model of high - energy physics ,",
    "the formation of topological defects such as domain walls , monopoles , cosmic string , among others are predicted to occur @xcite .",
    "these topologically stable structures have a number of interesting observable consequences , the detection of which would provide an important link between cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the various type of topological defects , the most studied . though the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out them as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , cosmic strings give rise to a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma rays bursts @xcite , the emission of gravitational waves @xcite and the generation of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "string - like defects also appear in a number of condensed matter systems , including liquid crystals and graphene made structures .    at large distances , the spacetime geometry for an ideal infinitely straight cosmic string , has a conical topology with a planar angle deficit proportional to its linear mass density . in quantum field theory",
    "the corresponding non - trivial topology induces nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for physical observables .",
    "these vacuum polarization effects in quantum field theory induced by this conical structure have been considered in a large number of papers . in the specific analysis for the vev of the energy - momentum tensor ,",
    "explicit calculations have been developed for scalar , fermionic , and electromagnetic fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the casimir - polder forces acting on a polarizable microparticle in the geometry of a cosmic string have been investigated in @xcite-@xcite . for charged fields , considering the presence of a magnetic flux running along the cosmic strings ,",
    "there appear additional contributions to the corresponding vacuum polarization effects @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux along the cosmic string also induces vacuum current densities .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated for scalar fields in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the induced fermionic currents in higher dimensional cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a magnetic flux has been developed in @xcite . in these analysis",
    "the authors have shown that induced vacuum current densities along the azimuthal direction appear if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a nonzero fractional part . in @xcite and @xcite it was investigated the induced current and the vacuum polarization effects , respectively , associated with quantum charged massive fermionic field in the geometry of a compactified cosmic string spacetime , considering the presence of an infinitely thin magnetic field running along the string s axis .",
    "the induced scalar current in the compactified cosmic string spacetime , has been developed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fermionic current induced by a magnetic flux in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional conical spacetime and in the presence of a circular boundary has also been analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors have showed that considering a non - vanishing extension for the magnetic field , the vev of the fermionic currents can be written as a sum of two contributions : the firsts ones due to the presence of an infinitely thin magnetic field , that depends only on the fractional part of the ratio of the total magnetic flux by the quantum one , and the seconds induced by the non - vanishing core of the magnetic field .",
    "the latter , in general , is not a periodic function function of the total magnetic flux .    in this paper",
    "we decided to continue in a similar line of previous investigation , considering the fermionic condensate and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with a massive charged fermionic field in the presence of an ideal cosmic string surrounded by a cylindrical magnetic tube that can be taken in three different configurations : @xmath5 a cylindrical shell of magnetic field , @xmath6 a magnetic field decaying with @xmath1 and @xmath7 a cylindrical homogeneous magnetic field with radius @xmath0 .",
    "for all these cases the axis of the magnetic tube coincides with the cosmic string .",
    "we want to study how the topological effect and the presence of the magnetic tube modify the above mentioned quantities . in @xcite",
    "we have pointed out that a realistic model for the cosmic string carrying a magnetic flux , named vortex , can not be exactly solvable .",
    "so , in order to provide some improvement in the calculations of the fermionic condensate and vev of energy - momentum tensor , we adopted the three above approximated models .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in the next section we present the geometry background associated with the spacetime under consideration and",
    "provide the complete set of normalized fermionic positive- and negative - energy wave function . in section [ fermicond ] , by using the mode summation formula",
    ", we evaluate the fermionic condensate ( fc ) in a compact form .",
    "we show that fc can be written as the sum of a contribution due to a infinitely thin magnetic field plus a core - induced contribution .",
    "specifically we analyze the core - induced part .",
    "we present its behavior in some specific regions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and provide some plots that exhibit its explicit dependences with some physical relevant parameters . in section [ emt ] , also by the using the mode sum method , we explicitly evaluate all components of the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) , and show that they can be written by the sum of two contributions as it was shown in previous analysis .",
    "moreover , we show that the emt is written in a diagonal form .",
    "the main objective of this section is devoted to analyze the core - induced contribution .",
    "we prove that , in similar way as the contribution due to the infinitely thin magnetic field , the core - induced contribution obeys the conservation condition and the trace identity .",

    "these calculations will be developed by using the summation method over the normalized fermionic modes . in recent publucation @xcite",
    "the authors have presented the complete procedure to construct the positive- and negative - energy fermionic wavefunctions in the region outside the magnetic tube , @xmath42 , considering three different configurations of magnetic fields .",

    "the fermionic condensate is defined as the vev of the scalar density @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 corresponds to the fermionic vacuum and @xmath79 is the dirac adjoint . as to the vev of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath80 . expanding the field operator in terms of the complete set @xmath81 .",

    "( [ fc4 ] ) provides the fc induced by the magnetic flux in minkowski spacetime .      as to @xmath123 , given by",
    ", it is finite and does not require any regularization procedure . to evaluate this contribution we proceed as follows : in the complex @xmath99 plane we rotate the integration contour by the angle @xmath124 for @xmath125 and by the angle @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , it shown in @xcite that the coefficient @xmath128 in satisfy the relation below : @xmath129 in this way , by using and the well known relations involving the hankel function of imaginary argument with the modified bessel functions @xcite , we can develop this calculation .",
    "the integral over the segments @xmath130 and @xmath131 are canceled . in the remaining integral over the imaginary axis",
    "we introduce the modified bessel functions .",
    "moreover , writing imaginary integral variable by @xmath132 , the core - induced fermionic condensate reads , @xmath133 where we use the notation @xmath134i_{\\beta_j}(z",
    "\\mbox{im}[{\\cal{v}}_j^{(i)}(iz / a , a)]k_{\\beta_j}(z a ) } \\   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that switching off the magnetic field , i.e. , taking @xmath135 , @xmath136 vanishes .",
    "after a convenient coordinate transformations we rewrite as @xmath137    before to start the explicit numerical analysis related to the core - induced fermionic condensate , let us now evaluate the behavior of it at large distance from the core , i.e. , let us consider the case where @xmath138 . in order to develop this analysis , we rewrite the modify bessel functions in in terms of their asymptotic forms .",
    "so , we can approximate the integrand of and consequently obtain an approximated expression for the fc : @xmath139    due to the exponential suppression of the integrand , the dominant contribution is given from the region near the lower limit of integration .",
    "then the leading order contribution is , @xmath140 so , we can see that for massive fields and at large distances from the core , the induced fermionic condensate decays exponentially with @xmath141 .",
    "the correction term in the above expression , depends on the specific model considered to describe the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , we also can obtain the dominant contribution for the above expression in the limit @xmath142 . in order to do that we have to analyze , for each specific model of magnetic field , the behavior of the factor @xmath143 for small arguments .",
    "so , below we present , for the region inside the magnetic tube , the radial functions , @xmath144 and @xmath145 :    1 .   for the first model , the cylindrical shell , we have : @xmath146 where @xmath147 , with @xmath148 for @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "2 .   for the second model , the magnetic field proportional to @xmath1",

    ", we have : @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 +    for the second and third models , the radial functions are given in terms of the whittaker functions , @xmath158 .    in the limit @xmath142 , the behavior of the fermionic condensate",
    "may be developed by the following way : first we change the summation on the angular moment @xmath159 , in , by @xmath160 . in this way",
    ", we can use a new notation , @xmath161 .",
    "we also change @xmath162 by @xmath163 , being @xmath114 given in .",
    "so from we can write ,    @xmath164    by the above expression we can write @xmath165 as follow : @xmath166i_{\\beta_n}(ma)}{k_{{\\tilde{\\beta}_n}}(m a)+ \\mbox{im}[{\\cal{v}}_{n - n_0}^{(i)}(im , a)]k_{\\beta_n}(ma ) } \\   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the orders of bessel functions are given by @xmath167    expanding the bessel functions in in powers of @xmath168 , the dominant term is given by the smallest power .",
    "so we have two possibilities : for @xmath169 this term is given by @xmath170 , and for @xmath171 this term is given for @xmath172 .",
    "so , we have :    * for @xmath173 : @xmath174 * for @xmath175 , and @xmath176    the next steps are the calculations of the dominants contribution for the coefficient that contains all the information about the core , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , for the three models .",
    "this can be done by explicit substitution of the radial functions , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , into .",
    "so , for @xmath142 , we find : @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 is a parameter depending on the specific model adopted for the magnetic field , given bellow by : @xmath184    our next analysis will be to investigate @xmath185 near the core , i.e. , @xmath186 , for the three different configurations of magnetic field .",
    "now let us analyze the fc near the boundary .",
    "in general the fermionic condensate diverges near this region , so the dominant contributions in comes to large values of @xmath187 . to find the leading term it is convenient to introduce a new variable @xmath188 , and use the uniform expansion for large order to the modified bessel functions .",
    "in order to make our work easier , we can see that is an even function of @xmath189 .",
    "this can be verified by observing that changing @xmath190 and @xmath191 , the order of bessel functions changes as @xmath192 and vice - verse .",
    "an analogue relation is obtained for @xmath193 . in this way , @xmath194 and the integrand of is not changed .",
    "so , let us consider @xmath195 in our analysis . in the summation over @xmath159 , we can proceed as follow : for positive values of @xmath159 , we have @xmath196 and for negative values of @xmath159 , we may change @xmath197 , so , @xmath198 ; however , the factor @xmath199 changes its sign . as consequence",
    "we have only to consider the summation over positive values of @xmath159 and double the result obtained .",
    "so , after introducing the new variable , @xmath188 , and by using the asymptotic expansion for larger order of the macdonald function , the dominant term in the integrand of is : @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "for the three models , it is necessary to find the leading term of @xmath202 for large value of @xmath159 .",
    "for the first model , this term is obtained by using expansions for the modified bessel functions ; as to the second and third models , we need the asymptotic expansion for the corresponding whittaker function . after some long and intermediate steps , we found that both leading terms coincide and are given bellow , @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",
    "because @xmath205 , for large and positive values of @xmath159 we can approximate @xmath206 .",
    "for the three models , the core - induced fermionic condensate behaves as @xmath207 moreover , we also can take the approximation @xmath208 , that is valid for @xmath209 . observing that the following ratio may be approximated by @xmath210 we have that the integration in can be approximated by @xmath211 solving the above integration",
    "we show that @xmath212 it means that the core - induced fermionic condensate diverges near the boundary , and its divergence is proportional to @xmath213 because the zero - thickness fc , @xmath214 , is finite in this region , we conclude that the total fc , eq .",

    "then we have @xmath261 .",
    "the total angular momentum operator acting on the negative energy wave function give us the following result , @xmath262 .",
    "moreover , we can observe that the anticommutator , @xmath263 , which appears in this development , vanishes .",
    "therefore , after some steps , we get @xmath264    now substituting the dirac matrix @xmath265 given by and the expressions for the negative - energy wavefunction , we obtain @xmath266 where the summation over @xmath239 provides an extra multiplicative factor @xmath267 .",
    "so , we have for the azimuthal stress the decomposition like , with the terms given by @xmath268 that corresponds to the zero - thickness contribution , and @xmath269 that corresponds the core - induced contribution .      in the development of the axial stress",
    ", we have to take @xmath270 in the covariant derivative of the field operator , in this way we have @xmath271 .",
    "in addition , the matrix @xmath272 coincides with the standard dirac matrix in the flat spacetime . for this component",
    ", we get @xmath273    substituting the expressions for the negative - energy wavefunction and the gamma matrix @xmath272 into above expression , we obtained , @xmath274 } \\ , \\ ] ] for the zero thickness contribution , and @xmath275f^{(i)}_{j}\\left(z\\frac{a}{r}\\right ) } \\ , \\ ] ] for core - induced one in the axial stress .    in @xcite we have shown , by convenient transformation , that the renormalized expressions for the zero - thickness contribution for energy - density coincides with the corresponding axial stress , i.e. , @xmath276 . here",
    "we also can observe that the core - induced contributions for the energy - density , eq .",
    ", coincides with the corresponding axial stress , , revealing also a boost invariance along the @xmath49axis for this system .",
    "in this section we want to investigate the properties and the asymptotic behavior of the vevs found in the previous section .",
    "we are interested to prove that the emt obeys the conservation condition , @xmath277 which for the system under consideration is reduced to a single differential equation , @xmath278 and the trace relation , @xmath279    it has been proved in @xcite , that the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with the idealized case , @xmath280 obeys both properties . as to the core - induced contribution , eq .",
    "is automatically satisfied by direct substitution of , and .",
    "also the trace relation , eq . , can be easily verified by adding all diagonal components of the core - induced components of energy - momentum tensor , , , and , and comparing with the fc given in .",
    "now in the rest of this section , we want to investigate the behavior of the components of the core - induced vev of the energy - momentum tensor in the region near the core , @xmath281 , and very from it , @xmath9 . in the latter we consider massive and massless fields .",
    "in fact we shall calculate the energy - density , that coincides with the axial stress , and the sum of the radial and azimuthal stresses . in this sense",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath282 .",
    "consequently @xmath283 .",
    "the procedure used to develop these analysis are very similar to those used in the fermionic condensate .",
    "so , we only reproduce below the final results .    * for @xmath138 ,    @xmath284    @xmath285    where we can see that for larges distances the above components of the energy - momentum tensor",
    "exponential decays like in the fermionic condensate .    * for @xmath281 ,    @xmath286    @xmath287    in both expressions above",
    "we have kept all the relevant sub - leading divergent terms in order to get the correct trace relation , eq . .",
    "our next analysis is to consider the vev of the energy - momentum tensor in the limit @xmath9 for the massless case . because the system presents a boost invariance along the @xmath49axis , and for massless case , we have @xmath288 .",
    "so we need only to calculate the @xmath289 in this limit : @xmath290    to explore the behavior of the energy - density in this limit we just need to take the approximated expression for the function @xmath291 in the limit @xmath292 .",
    "in fact a similar analysis has been developed in the fermionic condensate .",
    "there we have obtained the corresponding expressions given by eq.s and .",
    "so for this case we have only to change the argument @xmath168 by @xmath293 .",
    "the results are given below :    * for @xmath294    @xmath295    * for @xmath175 , and    @xmath296    substituting the above expressions into , and taking into account , for all different models , the radial function , @xmath297 , in the limit @xmath292 , after some intermediate steps , we get : @xmath298 where @xmath299 and @xmath183 are given by eq.s and .",
    "so we can conclude that in the massless case and for @xmath9 the energy - momentum tensor decays with @xmath300 .",
    "we finish this discussion by saying that in all limits taken , the trace relation is preserved .",
    "after these above general descriptions about the core - induced vev of the energy - momentum tensor , we would like to provide some additional informations which are not easily observed by the analytical expressions .",
    "so , in order to full fill this lack , in the rest of this section we will develop some numerical evaluations .    in fig.[fg3 ] , we display the dependence of the core - induced energy density , @xmath301 , as a function of @xmath141 taking @xmath216 and @xmath217 . in the left plot ,",
