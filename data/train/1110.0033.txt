    "the determination of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in molecular clouds and in galaxies is one of the main challenges of star formation theory . in the modern paradigm of star formation ,",
    "stars form out of prestellar cores which result from the gravo - turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds ( e.g. maclow & klessen 2004 ) . within the past few years ,",
    "two analytical approaches have emerged , aiming at characterizing the sfr issued from the probability density function ( pdf ) of density fluctuations induced by turbulence in the cloud ( krumholz & mckee 2005-km , padoan & nordlund 2011-pn ) .",
    "both theories rely on ( i ) a density threshold , whose nature differs in each case , for star formation , ( ii ) _ one _ characteristic dynamical timescale , defined either at the cloud s mean density or at the threshold density . in this letter , we derive a sfr , based on our imf analytical theory ( hennebelle & chabrier 2008-hc08 , 2009-hc09 , chabrier & hennebelle 2011 ) , and show that ( i ) this theory yields sfr values in good agreement with observations , ( ii ) there is no _ a priori _ density threshold for star formation ; instead , the sfr _ continuously _ increases with gas density , with indeed two different regimes .",
    "we also show that the exact value of the sfr depends on the combination of some ill - determined parameters , notably the core - to - star efficiency and the crossing timescale , whose uncertainties , and dependence upon cloud conditions , hamper an exact determination of the sfr .",
    "we first summarize the previous sfr theories by km and pn .",
    "we then briefly present the sfr derived from a time - dependent extension of our theory of star formation , which will be presented in details in a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally we present a simplified version of this theory which , alternatively , can be seen as an improved km or pn theory .",
    "following krumholz & mckee ( 2005 ) , we define the dimensionless _ star formation rate per free - fall time _ , @xmath0 , as the fraction of cloud mass converted into stars per cloud",
    "_ mean _ free - fall time , @xmath1 , i.e. : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the _ total star formation rate _",
    "arising from a cloud of mass @xmath4 , size @xmath5 and mean density @xmath6 .      according to various simulations of hydrodynamic or mhd supersonic turbulence ,",
    "the density pdf is well represented in both cases by a lognormal form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mach number and @xmath9 ( federrath et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the essence of the km analysis is to assume that there is a critical density , @xmath10 , above which star formation is occuring .",
    "then , the sfr ( eqn.(20 ) of km ) is simply obtained by estimating the fraction of gas with density larger than @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "km further assume that @xmath13 .    in this expression",
    ", @xmath14 is the ( supposedly mass - independent ) efficiency with which the mass within the collapsing prestellar cores is converted into stars .",
    "calculations ( e.g. matzner & mckee 2000 , ciardi & hennebelle 2010 ) as well as observations ( e.g. andr et al .",
    "2010 ) suggest that @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 corresponds to the time needed for a self - gravitating fluctuation to be replenished .",
    "km estimate it to be of the order of a few , in agreement with the analysis we propose in the appendix .    in km , @xmath10 is determined from the condition that the corresponding jeans length must be equal to the sonic length .",
    "their underlying assumption is that turbulent support will be too efficient to enable star formation at scales larger than the sonic length .",
    "this yields @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a coefficient of order unity , @xmath19 is the jeans length at the mean cloud density and @xmath20 is the sonic length .",
    "the expression obtained by pn is similar to the km one , stated by eqn .",
    "( [ sfr_simple ] ) , except that they do not assume @xmath21 , but instead @xmath22 , as indeed comes out from the integral in eqn .",
    "( [ sfr_simple ] ) .",
    "they consider that both @xmath14 and @xmath16 are equal to 1 , except in the magnetized case where they argue that @xmath23 ( which appears to be the main reason for the reduced sfr in the magnetized case ) .",
    "with eqns .",
    "( [ pr0 ] ) and ( [ sfr_simple ] ) , this yields ( eqn.(30 ) of pn ) @xmath24 . \\label{sfr_simple2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the main difference with the km model , however , resides in the choice of @xmath10 . in pn , this latter is obtained by requiring that the corresponding jeans length be equal to the typical thickness of the shocked layer , inferred by combining isothermal shock jump conditions and a turbulent velocity scaling @xmath25 .",
    "this yields @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ratio of the cloud size over the turbulent integral scale and @xmath28 is the virial parameter , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rms velocity within the cloud , representative of the level of turbulent vs gravitational energy in the cloud ( eqns.(8 - 9 ) of pn ) .      in the hc theory of star formation ( see hc08 , hc09 ) prestellar cores are the outcome of initial density fluctuations that isolate themselves from the surrounding medium under the action of gravity .",
    "these fluctuations are determined by identifying in the cloud s random field of density fluctuations the structures of mass @xmath31 which at scale @xmath32 are gravitationally unstable , according to the virial theorem .",
    "this condition defines a _ scale - dependent _",
    "( log)-density threshold , @xmath33 , or equivalently a scale - dependent jeans mass , @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the sound speed , g the gravitational constant , @xmath37 a constant of order unity while @xmath30 and @xmath38 determine the rms velocity : @xmath39 a fluctuation of scale @xmath32 will be replenished within a typical crossing time @xmath40 , and will thus be replenished a number of time equal to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the freefall time at scale @xmath32 ( see appendix ) , i.e. at density @xmath43 . including this condition into the hc formalism yields , after some algebra , for the number - density mass spectrum of gravitationally bound structures , @xmath44 :    @xmath45    apart for the time ratio @xmath46 , this equation is similar to equation  ( 33 ) of hc08 and equation  ( 27 ) of hc09 . according to this definition",
    ", @xmath0 is thus given by the integral of the mass spectrum specified by equation  ( [ spec_mass ] ) : @xmath47 according to eqn .",
    "( [ crit_mtot ] ) , @xmath48 correponds to the mass associated with the largest size fluctuations that can turn unstable in the cloud , @xmath49 .",
    "we verified that , as long as @xmath50 is not too small , the results depend only weakly on its value ( hennebelle & chabrier , in prep . ) . in the following",
    ", we will pick @xmath51 as our fiducial value .",
    "a few remarks are worth discussing at this stage .",
    "first , in the present theory there is no explicitly introduced critical scale or density for star formation , as we sum up over all gravitationally unstable cores , irrespectively of their scale or density .",
    "this is achieved through the multiscale analysis expressed by eqns .",
    "( [ spec_mass])-([sfr_hc ] ) . indeed , turbulence is by essence a multi - scale phenomenon and introducing a critical scale does not appear clearly justified . indeed ,",
    "a piece of fluid , even if dominated by turbulence , can still collapse if it is self - gravitating .",
    "another essential difference with the km and pn theories is that these latter rely on a unique characteristic collapsing time ( the mean cloud freefall time in km and the critical density freefall time in pn ) .",
    "this can be seen from eqns .",
    "( [ sfr_simple ] ) and ( [ sfr_simple2 ] ) , where the term @xmath52 , taken at @xmath53 , lies outside the integral . in constrast , in our theory ( see eqn .",
    "( [ sfr_hc ] ) ) , the freefall density dependence of each collapsing structure is properly accounted for , as the freefall time consistently varies with mass @xmath31 and scale @xmath32 , @xmath54 .      even though we stress that the sfr can not be properly determined by a simple integral of the density pdf , because such an integral , unlike eqn .",
    "( [ sfr_hc ] ) , does not take into account the spatial distribution of the gas , we suggest the following simplified but more consistent expression , which retains the collapsing time density - dependence , instead of eqns .",
    "( [ sfr_simple ] ) and  ( [ sfr_simple2 ] ) :    @xmath55 . \\label{sfr_corrected}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this sfr is larger than the ones given by eqns .",
    "( [ sfr_simple ] ) and  ( [ sfr_simple2 ] ) , as shown in the next section .",
    "we consider different choices for @xmath10 .",
    "when using @xmath56 or @xmath57 , we refer to the corresponding sfr as `` multi - freefall km or pn '' , respectively .",
    "we also consider another value for @xmath10 , obtained by simply requiring that the jeans length at this density is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that only fluctuations smaller than a given cloud size fraction can collapse .",
    "we simply refer to this model as `` multi - freefall . ''",
    "it is easy to check that eqn.([sfr_corrected ] ) depends only weakly on @xmath50 , except when @xmath59 .",
    "we now compare the @xmath0 predicted by the various theories and confront the results to recent observations .          as in km and pn , we define the cloud properties by @xmath60 and @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ sfr0 ] displays @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath0 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , obtained with different formalisms , for various values of the virial parameter , and for three typical mach numbers , namely @xmath6416 , 9 and 4 .",
    "both the hc and the multi - freefall models are larger by a factor @xmath652 - 3 than pn and by at least an order of magnitude than km .",
    "this stems from the fact that , when taking into account the density - dependence of the structure collapsing times , ( i ) dense regions collapse fast , and ( ii ) fluctuations denser than @xmath10 have a smaller free - fall time than the ones at @xmath10 , globally increasing the value of @xmath61 .",
    "when such a density - dependence is properly accounted for , all sfr determinations are in better agreement .",
    "nevertheless , some differences persist between the various multi - freefall models .",
    "this stems from the choice of @xmath10 . indeed , the choice of @xmath53 in the km and pn theories ( see  2.1 and 2.2 ) yields @xmath66 and thus corresponds to very small values of @xmath50 , implying that only small jeans masses ( or conversely only very dense structures ) are taken into account in these models .",
    "two interesting trends can be inferred from fig .",
    ", increasing the virial parameter leads to a decrease of the sfr , with a severe reduction above some typical value of @xmath28 , which decreases with decreasing mach number .",
    "this naturally arises from the fact that , as @xmath28 increases , the increasing contribution of kinetic energy over potential energy prevents gravitational collapse and thus inhibits star formation , a point already noticed by km and pn .",
    "second , the sfr increases , although modestly , with the mach number .",
    "this is because increasing the mach number extends the core mass function ( cmf ) into the low - mass domain ( see pn and hc08 ) and , as small - scale structures have shorter free - fall times , this increases the number of collapsing small cores , thus the sfr .",
    "this positive dependence of the sfr upon @xmath8 is in agreement with the results of pn but contrasts with the ones of km ( see their equation  30 ) , as seen in the figure .",
    "such a decreasing dependence of the sfr with increasing mach in the km theory clearly stems from the fact that the @xmath67 term ( see eqn.([sfr_simple2 ] ) ) is lacking in their eqn .",
    "( 20 ) .",
    "star forming giant molecular clouds in the milky way have masses @xmath68 , with @xmath69 - 30 and @xmath70 - 3 .",
    "the observed sfr per cloud free - fall time lies in the range @xmath71 , with a mean value @xmath72 ( murray 2011 , although see feldmann & gnedin 2011 for caution ) .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and heiderman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find sfr s in the range @xmath73 - 0.12 for nearby molecular clouds and @xmath74 - 0.5 for massive star - forming dense clumps , yielding a mean value @xmath75 , about an order of magnitude larger than the values predicted by km .",
    "krumholz & tan ( 2007 , fig .",
    "5 ) report lower values at low density . at high density ( @xmath76 @xmath77 ) , however , two of their three data ( onc and cs(5 - 4 ) ) , are compatible with the aforementioned mean values . according to our calculations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , for such cloud / clump characteristics , @xmath61 is predicted to lie within the range @xmath78 - 3 . as discussed in   [ krum ] and in the appendix , the effective sfr is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 0.1 - 0.2 . therefore , according to the present calculations , theories based on a multi - freefall formalism yield sfr s per free - fall time in typical molecular clumps in the range @xmath81 0.03 - 0.6 , going from low - dense clouds to the densest clumps , consistent with the observed values .",
    "figure 2 displays the sfr per unit area , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , as a function of cloud surface densities , @xmath84 , for four typical cloud sizes , @xmath85 1 , 4 10 and 40 pc .",

    "lada et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and heiderman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) data for clouds and massive clumps are shown for comparison .",
    "clearly , almost all theories exhibit a direct correlation between the density of star formation and the gas density and , when including the @xmath95 factor , reproduce well the observational results , except possibly for the densest clumps , where the sfr s are about a factor @xmath96 larger .",
    "the large spread of the data precludes a clear distinction between the theories at this stage , apart from the km one which clearly lies well below most of the data points .",
    "interestingly , both the exact hc and `` multi free - fall '' calculations predict a drastic drop in the sfr below @xmath97 - 120 @xmath98 pc@xmath99 and a change of slope in the @xmath100 relation , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , similar to the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( @xmath103 ) , respectively below and above @xmath104 , in very good agreement with the observations ( heiderman et al .",

    "various authors ( e.g. johnstone et al .",
    "2004 , kirk et al .",
    "2006 , heiderman et al .",
    "2010 ) have suggested that the origin of such a density threshold is related to magnetic fields , which can not support the gas against gravitational collapse above some density .",
    "the present calculations , however , show that there is no need to invoke magnetic field support or mhd shock conditions to get such a threshold although , as mentioned in the appendix , magnetic fields may contribute _ dynamically _ by reducing the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the threshold simply stems from the fact that at the corresponding density , the size of the clumps becomes comparable to the jeans length and thus the amount of gas appropriate to form stars drops drastically ( see hc09 fig .",
    "the relative similarity between the various `` multi free - fall '' predictions clearly indicates that , besides the @xmath107 factor , the key physical quantity which determines the sfr is the _ density - dependence _ of the freefall time of the collapsing overdense regions induced by turbulence . an alternative possibility , as recently suggested by krumholz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is to assume that the sfr is simply a constant factor times the cloud s or galaxy s volume density over mean free - fall time , although a clear physical explanation is lacking at this stage .",
    "we have included the time dependence in our analytical theory of the imf to determine the sfr .",
    "the theory , based on a gravoturbulent picture of star formation , yields sfr values in good agreement with various observational determinations in galactic molecular clouds .",
    "moreover , it naturally predicts a density threshold to get significant star formation and yields a dependence of the sfr upon gas surface density in very good agreement with the observationally inferred values , with an abrupt change of slope around the threshold .",
    "such a threshold naturally emerges from our theory , without arbitrarily introducing a critical density . a crucial point at the heart of the present (",
    "both complete and simplified ( eq . ( 8) ) ) approach is that , in contrast to previous theories , the sfr is not characterized by a single , characteristic dynamical time in the cloud , but instead involves a _ density - dependent _ collapsing time for each turbulence - induced gravity - dominated overdense region in the cloud .",
    "therefore , in opposite to conclusions based on previous sfr theories , the present results show that a sfr determined by turbulence - induced density fluctuations at the early stages of star formation provides quite a consistent picture of star formation in milky way molecular clouds .",

    "note that this estimate assumes that it takes about one crossing time to rejuvenate a self - gravitating structure .",
