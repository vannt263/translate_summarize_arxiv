    "jets are collimated sprays of particles created from an energetic parton ( quark or gluon ) , which is produced in the initial stage of the collision .",
    "they are an excellent tool to test pqcd and study fragmentation and hadronisation in proton - proton collisions and their modification in collisions of heavy ions . here",
    ", they also serve as probe of hot and dense nuclear matter with an aim of exploring quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is a challenging task due to an elusive characteristics that requires a combination of various signatures .",
    "a large ion colliding experiment ( alice ) has excellent tracking capabilities and can reconstruct and identify charged particles with transverse momenta down to 150  mev/@xmath2 .",
    "we report measurements of the charged jet spectra and jet shape observables , such as charged track multiplicities and radial momentum density distributions  @xcite .",
    "these observables are studied at centre of mass energy @xmath3  tev and compared to predictions obtained from monte - carlo generators .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on an analysis of the data from proton - proton collisions at the lhc taken in 2010 by the alice .",
    "the online event selection is done using the v - zero ( v0 ) detector and inner tracking system ( its ) , selecting 160 m minimum bias events . from these events , only those with reconstructed primary vertex within 10  cm from the nominal interaction point",
    "are further analysed .    for charged jet reconstruction , tracks from",
    "the its and time projection chamber ( tpc ) are used .",
    "these tracks are selected to be within pseudorapidity @xmath4 and transverse momenta ( @xmath5 ) greater than 0.15  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "they are used as input for fastjet  @xcite to reconstruct jets using anti-@xmath1 algorithm .",
    "it belongs to sequential recombination jet algorithms .",
    "anti-@xmath1 merges hard particles first while @xmath1 starts with soft particles and is therefore more suitable for determination of background .",
    "resolution parameters @xmath6 , used in this analysis are 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 . for further analysis",
    ", jets had to have @xmath5 of at least 5  gev/@xmath2 and be within @xmath7 .    in order to correct effects of detector response and",
    "to obtain charged jet spectra at particle level and corrected jet shape observables . to do this",
    "we are using pythia  @xcite  ( perugia0 tune ) simulated data to obtain spectra on a particle level and a full geant simulation of detector to extract detector response matrices linking generator level jet spectra with recontructed spectra .",
    "we use 3 different correction procedures .    as pythia reproduces the measured jet observables such as spectra and jet shapes , reasonably well , as seen in  @xcite",
    ", we adopted a bin - by - bin correction procedure using simulated events as first method . in this technique ,",
    "the correction factors ( cf ) are computed for each jet @xmath5 bin as the ratio between the observable at particle level and the same observable at a detector level in the same @xmath5 bin , @xmath8 this correction is subsequently applied to a raw jet spectrum .",
    "second method , we used to find an inverse matrix to the response matrix , is bayesian unfolding  @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the response matrix is composed of a probability distributions of finding given a cause  generated jet of given @xmath9  as an effect  reconstructed jet with any value @xmath10 .",
    "third method and another regularized unfolding procedure used as a cross - check in jet spectrum analysis is the singular value decomposition of the response matrix  @xcite .",
    "this method decomposes the response matrix into two square orthogonal matrices and a diagonal singular matrix .",
    "subsequently it converts the problem to a system of linear equations and solves it .",
    "in fig .  [ res - spectra ] we present the unfolded charged jet spectra for anti-@xmath1 algorithm with resolution parameters @xmath11 of 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 in top panel , with the relative systematic uncertainties in the bottom panel of each plot , reconstructed from proton - proton collisions at @xmath12  tev using the alice detector system .",
    "the most significant uncertainties are obtained from varying track reconstruction effiency , track @xmath13 resolution and simulation with parametrised detector response .",
    "the final systematic uncertainties are obtained by adding above mentioned uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "the results presented here are consistent with results obtained by the atlas collaboration  @xcite , as shown in the fig  [ res - spectra - atlas ] , obtained from charged tracks in @xmath14 with @xmath15  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "[ res ] shows jet shape variables .",
    "the charged track multiplicity of a jet , defined as a mean number of charged tracks in the leading jet , i.e. one with the largest transverse momentum in the event , belonging to given @xmath16 bin , is obtained from charged tracks used for the jet reconstruction within a jet cone . the mean track multiplicity in such jets obtained from the analysed data",
    "is shown in fig  [ res - tracks ] , with respect to a charged jets transverse momentum bin .",
    "increasing value of average number of tracks is observed with increasing jet @xmath13 bin , as previously measured by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "also , predictions obtained from the pythia ( perugia0 tune ) , pythia ( perugia11 tune ) and phojet  @xcite are shown here .",
    "results from data differ by 10% from values obtained from monte - carlo predictions .",
    "the radial momentum density is defined for jets of given @xmath16 bin as a sum of momenta of charged tracks @xmath17 belonging to the leading jet with respect to their distance from the jet axis in @xmath18 plane , normalized by number of jets ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the sum of @xmath17 of all charged tracks which are displaced from jet axis by @xmath21 of given jet .",
    "@xmath22 is number of leading jets in analysis .    in the fig  [ res - tracks1 ]",
    "we observe a decreasing radial momentum density with decreasing distance from a jet axis .",
    "this suggests that most of the jet energy is concentrated around a jet axis .",
    "comparison of the slopes of two different jet @xmath13 bins at a small distances from jet axis indicate that high energy jets are more collimated than jets with smaller energy .",
    "we reported measurements of inclusive charged jet spectra in pp collisions at midrapidity , charged track multiplicities within leading jet and the radial momentum density for jets reconstructed using anti-@xmath1 algorithm .",
    "the reconstructed jet spectra are consistent with results obtained from the atlas collaboration and jet shape observables follow the trend expected from previous results of the cdf collaboration and are in reasonable agreement with predictions from pythia and phojet calculations .",
