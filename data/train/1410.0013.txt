    "binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers are among the most powerful sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) which are expected to be detected in the next few years by advanced ligo and virgo , and they are also the main candidates for the central engine of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs , e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the two main scenarios for the central engine of sgrbs involve the formation of a strongly magnetized torus around a spinning black hole ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) or the formation of a long - lived magnetar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "neutron stars are often magnetized and , during the merger of two nss , magnetic fields can be strongly amplified via instabilities in the plasma , such as the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability  @xcite .",
    "while previous newtonian simulations have shown that magnetic fields can be amplified by several orders of magnitude , reaching magnetar - level fields of @xmath2 when starting with @xmath3 @xcite , subsequent and independent studies in full general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) did not find such large amplifications  @xcite .",
    "grmhd simulations used grid - based codes with resolutions that were not sufficiently high to resolve the smallest turbulent scale and reach convergence . for example , in the presence of kh instabilities , higher resolutions can resolve smaller - scale vortices  @xcite and this can lead to stronger magnetic field amplifications .",
    "in addition , local high - resolution simulations performed in the last few years have shown that magnetic fields can indeed be amplified at merger by several orders of magnitude and reach equipartition with the kinetic energy of the turbulent fluid  @xcite . unfortunately , in order to fully resolve such scales , one would need to employ resolutions of the order of @xmath4 or higher  @xcite , which is currently impossible to obtain in global simulations of bns mergers ( where resolutions are of the order of @xmath5 ) .    here , we develop a subgrid model which allows global grmhd simulations of bns merger to include small - scale effects and , in particular , properly resolve the magnetic field amplification during merger .",
    "other subgrid models have already been used with success in other scenarios , such as magnetic field amplification in accretion disks  @xcite , and here we show for the first time their useful role during bns mergers .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] details our numerical methods and the initial models , and in section  [ sec : subgrid ] we provide a detailed description of the implementation of the subgrid model .",
    "section  [ sec : dynamics ] describes the evolution of the magnetic field when the subgrid model is implemented . in section  [ sec : global ] we discuss whether this amplification is only localized in a small region of the domain or if it also happens on a global scale , while in section  [ sec : energy ] we discuss the magnetic energy generated by the turbulence and its impact on electromagnetic emission , including the possible production of sgrbs .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main results . for convenience",
    ", we use a system of units in which @xmath6 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the simulations presented here were performed using our fully grmhd code ` whisky `  @xcite which is coupled with the publicly available einstein toolkit  @xcite . in particular , the spacetime evolution is computed using the ` mclachlan ` code  @xcite while ` whisky ` solves the equations of grmhd written in a conservative form  @xcite . in order to guarantee the divergence - free character of the magnetic field , we directly evolve the vector potential using the modified lorenz gauge  @xcite .",
    "we also use adaptive mesh refinement via the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite by adopting six refinement levels with the finest grids completely covering each of the nss . after the merger , the finest grid",
    "is enlarged in order to cover the hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ; @xcite ) .",
    "our fiducial runs have a resolution of @xmath7 on the finest grid ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] ) while the coarsest grid extends up to @xmath8 .",
    "the initial data was produced using the publicly available code lorene  @xcite .",
    "the matter is modeled using a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 the rest - mass density , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an ideal - fluid eos with @xmath13 is used during the evolution in order to allow for shock heating during the merger .",
    "the initial data is the same `` high - mass '' model used in our previous simulations  @xcite and it consists of an equal - mass system of two nss with gravitational mass @xmath14 at an initial coordinate separation of @xmath15 ( approximately @xmath16 orbits before merger ) .",
    "the magnetic field is initially purely poloidal and aligned with the angular momentum of the binary as in  @xcite .",
    "the initial amplitude of the maximum of the magnetic field , as measured by a normal observer , is @xmath17 .",
    "our subgrid model is intended to account for electromotive forces arising from unresolved fluctuations in the magnetic field and bulk fluid velocity . in particular , we assume that the unresolved turbulence , and the velocity field associated with it , gives rise to an extra electric field @xmath18 which is added to the right - hand side of the evolution equation for the vector potential @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard electric field coming from the ideal - mhd equations and is computed using the flux - cd approach as described in @xcite . we note that this new evolution equation for the vector potential does not violate maxwell s equations , but it may not satisfy the ideal - mhd condition .",
    "our assumption is that @xmath18 would naturally arise in very high - resolution simulations where the turbulence is fully resolved , but that it is currently missing due to the still low resolution employed in bns simulations .",
    "we therefore adopt a closure scheme intended to account for small - scale dynamo action driven by the turbulent cascade at the unresolved length scales .",
    "the effect of this dynamo has been found , through detailed local simulations @xcite of relativistic mhd turbulence , to drive the large - scale ( resolved ) magnetic energy density toward equipartition with the local turbulent kinetic energy density on a timescale given by the turn over of the energy containing eddies .",
    "we characterize the turbulent kinetic energy density by the field @xmath22 , whose value is obtained through a prescription outlined below .",
    "the exponentially growing solution is then given by @xmath23 and is parameterized around the exponentiation rate @xmath24 which we take to be a fraction @xmath25 of the local fluid vorticity .",
    "exponentiation of the magnetic field stops when the local electromagnetic energy density is a fraction @xmath26 of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , our closure scheme is parameterized around the following prescription for @xmath24 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the value of the rest - mass density @xmath11 in the artificial atmosphere , @xmath29 is the magnetic energy density , and @xmath22 is a measure of the kinetic energy of the turbulent portion of the fluid  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 have been chosen based on the results of  @xcite ( coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and in order to avoid spurious magnetic field amplifications ( coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , especially in regions near the surface of the neutron star where the ( flat - space ) vorticity , @xmath36 , is artificially high because of a jump in the value of the velocity ( since @xmath37 is set to zero in the artificial atmosphere ) .",
    "we note , in particular , that the value of @xmath26 sets the saturation level for the magnetic field and our value ( @xmath31 ) stops the magnetic field growth when the magnetic energy density is equal to @xmath38 of the kinetic energy density , in agreement with the results of  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath25 was chosen instead to allow the growth to happen on a timescale of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 instead need to be fine tuned in order to avoid spurious amplifications , especially at the ns surface .",
    ", the blue dashed line to @xmath40 , the purple long dashed line to @xmath41 , and the red dotted line to @xmath42 ( all resolutions @xmath43 refer to the resolution on the finest grid , i.e. , the one covering the nss ) . the vertical black dashed line indicates the time of the merger of the two ns cores ( which also corresponds to the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave signal ) , while the external layers start merging a few ms before . [ figure2 ] ]    @xmath22 is computed following  @xcite where for an ideal - fluid eos we have @xmath44 , and hence ( since @xmath13 in our case ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the simple volume averages of the rest - mass density and pressure , respectively , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the `` conservative '' averages of the rest - mass density and pressure ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the last two are computed by averaging the conserved variables over a region of space and then computing @xmath11 and @xmath10 using our standard conservative to primitive solver  @xcite . when computing the volume average and the conservative average of @xmath11 and @xmath10 one needs to choose the size of the volume over which the average is computed . in our simulations",
    ", we used a cubic box of size @xmath50 , with @xmath43 being the resolution of the grid . in this way ,",
    "when computing @xmath51 on each grid point , we simply need to know the values of the primitive and conservative variables on the next three grid points in each direction ( e.g. , the three grid points on the left and the three on the right along the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 directions ) .",
    "this choice has been made in order to reduce the computational cost ( i.e. , mpi calls ) of such computations .",
    "we ran two simulations using the same initial data , but in one case we used the subgrid model described in the previous section , while in the other we evolved the system using the `` standard '' vector potential equations , i.e. , without adding the subgrid term @xmath55 to the right - hand side of the evolution equations for @xmath56 . here , we first report on the results obtained with the new subgrid model and in the next section we compare with the `` standard '' evolution .    in figure  [ figure1 ] we show , at @xmath57 , the value on the equatorial plane of the rest - mass density @xmath11 , of @xmath58 ( top - left panel ) , of @xmath22 ( top - right panel ) , of @xmath24 ( bottom - left panel ) , and of the magnetic energy density @xmath29 ( bottom - right panel ) . in the last panel , in particular , we compare the magnetic energy density between a `` standard '' evolution ( left side ) and the case in which the subgrid model is implemented ( right side ) . from these figures",
    "one can see that the regions where @xmath24 is non zero and the magnetic field is amplified are indeed those where the kh instability is more active ( compare also with  @xcite and @xcite ) . indeed , in those regions , both the vorticity ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath22 are much larger than zero and have their maximum values . note also that the vorticity is also quite large in regions outside the central region .",
    "the choice of our parameters in equation  [ eq_subgrid ] is such that those regions are excluded , since the turbulence there , which is anyway smaller than in the central regions , is due to the interaction with the artificial atmosphere .",
    "order of magnitude , in the simulation implementing the subgrid model the magnetic field grows up to @xmath60 g and it saturates when reaching equipartition with the kinetic energy of the fluid in the turbulent regions.[figure3 ] ]    in figure  [ figure2 ] , we show how the amplification changes with resolution .",
    "we reran the same model with one higher resolution ( @xmath61 ) and two lower resolutions ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) . in figure",
    "[ figure2 ] , we plot the evolution of the magnetic energy and , while the lowest - resolution run ( red dotted line ) shows only a modest increase due to just two orders of magnitude amplification in the magnetic field , the other three resolutions show a much larger increase . in particular ,",
    "the two highest - resolution runs produce the same magnetic energy ( and the same magnetic field values ) , indicating that saturation has been reached .",
    "we note that this is the first time that such a saturation level is reached in a bns simulation .",
    "previous grmhd simulations were not able to amplify the magnetic field more than @xmath64 order of magnitude at merger and only the newtonian simulations by  @xcite showed large magnetic field amplifications , but no saturation was reached and different values were obtained for different resolutions .     computed where @xmath65 .",
    "the values of @xmath66 at @xmath67 are due to the artificial shocks that develop on the ns surfaces during the inspiral ( due to the fact that we evolve our nss using an ideal - fluid eos and that our nss do not have a solid crust ) .",
    "as one can easily see , the values of @xmath66 during the first part of the inspiral are at least @xmath68 orders of magnitude below those reached during merger .",
    "moreover , they do not affect the evolution of the magnetic field as one can see both from this figure ( the magnetic energy is constant as in the standard case ) and from figure  [ figure3 ] , where the mean value , as well as the maximum ( not shown ) , of the magnetic field does not grow during the inspiral and it is identical to the value in the standard run ( i.e , when the subgrid model is not used ) .",
    "[ figure4 ] ]",
    "in figure  [ figure3 ] we plot the weighted - average of the magnetic field amplitude : @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the proper volume .",
    "the black solid lines represent the evolution of @xmath71 when the subgrid model is used , while the blue dashed line represents the `` standard '' evolution . in both cases",
    ", we used our fiducial resolution ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "first of all , while the maximum of the magnetic field saturates to @xmath73 when the subgrid model is used , its mean value saturates to @xmath0 .",
    "this is a clear indication that during the evolution the strong magnetic field generated in the turbulent regions expands and covers a large portion of the hmns formed after the merger .",
    "the magnetic field amplification is therefore not killed during the merger but survives and may considerably affect the post - merger evolution  @xcite .",
    "the blue dashed line represents instead the mean value of the magnetic field when the subgrid model is not used . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field grows only by one order of magnitude , as seen in previous simulations  @xcite . by properly taking into account the amplifications due to the subgrid - scale turbulence , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified by @xmath74 orders of magnitude with respect to what can be afforded by current resolutions .",
    "indeed , we expect that even without our subgrid model , one should be able to obtain such large fields when employing sufficiently large resolutions in order to reach saturation ( which may not happen for @xmath75 ) .",
    "in figure  [ figure4 ] we plot the evolution of the magnetic energy both when the subgrid model is used ( solid black line ) and when it is not ( dashed blue line ) .",
    "we also plot the turbulent energy @xmath76 , i.e. , the integral of @xmath22 for the case in which the subgrid model is used . during the merger",
    ", @xmath66 grows by several orders of magnitude and it is followed by an increase in the magnetic energy .",
    "the small delay ( less than a ms ) between the onset of the two growths is due to the time the magnetic field needs in order to be amplified over a large region ( the maximum of the magnetic field grows indeed much earlier and almost simultaneously with the growth of @xmath66 ) .",
    "these results predict the rapid production of a magnetic energy reservoir on the order of @xmath77 in the moments after the merger onset .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that a powerful electromagnetic transient could be powered by the conversion of even a small fraction of that magnetic energy into escaped photons . there , it was proposed that strong magnetic fields undergoing violent reconnection in the merger remnant s atmosphere could power electromagnetic explosions capable of accelerating plasma to large lorentz factors .",
    "high - energy photons escape to the observer once the accelerated plasma has overtaken the slow ( @xmath78 ) baryonic outflow .",
    "the production of magnetic explosions is proposed to operate in a manner not unlike those thought to power the so - called giant magnetar flares  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these high - energy transients could be associated with sgrb precursor emission  @xcite or even the sgrb itself .",
    "we presented the first subgrid model for grmhd simulations of bns mergers that can be used to study small - scale magnetic field amplifications in global bns simulations .",
    "we show for the first time that , by assuming dynamo saturation , magnetic field values of the order of @xmath79 can be easily produced in bns mergers .",
    "this large magnetic field corresponds to a magnetic energy in the plasma of @xmath77 .",
    "such large magnetic fields and energy can lead to the production of strong electromagnetic signals  @xcite , sgrbs  @xcite , and also long - lasting gw emission if a stable magnetar is formed after merger  @xcite . in future papers",
    ", we will study the effect of this field amplification on the evolution of the hmns , on the shape of the gw signal , on the possible emission of relativistic jets , and on ejecta masses and distribution , which may have consequences for r - process nucleosynthesis as well as jet collimation and the production of electromagnetic transients from circum - merger interactions  @xcite .    as a final comment",
    ", we also note that this subgrid model should be implemented only as long as grmhd simulations of bnss are not able to use the resolutions required to fully resolve the turbulence .",
    "this will require high - order numerical codes combined with very high resolutions ( @xmath80 ) which are currently unfeasible .",
