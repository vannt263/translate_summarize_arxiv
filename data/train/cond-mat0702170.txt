    "many aspects of the slowing down of the dynamics of a liquid as it is cooled or compressed towards its glass transition are accurately captured by mode - coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite .",
    "although cast in terms of collective coordinates ( fourier components of density ) , mct is often thought to model the formation of ` cages ' whereby a given particle is constrained by its neighbors in real space .",
    "however , the theory , at least in its simplest ( ` standard ' ) form ( smct ) , breaks down in the final approach to the glassy state ( see , for example , refs @xcite ) . in particular , mct predicts a complete arrest of density fluctuations at long times @xcite ; this _ ideal glass transition _ occurs at weaker coupling ( higher temperatures and lower densities ) than the experimental glass transition .",
    "the continued decay of fluctuations at stronger couplings is usually attributed to activated ( ` hopping ' ) processes , not captured by smct @xcite . in their simplest form , these could involve escape from a cage by activation over a local barrier , which would give an arrhenius factor cutting off the divergence of the relaxation time .",
    "however , in many glasses , the relaxation time shows a stronger - than - arrhenius dependence far into the regime beyond the ideal glass transition , suggesting a collective aspect to the hopping dynamics .",
    "much current research addresses many - body activated processes at a supra - cage scale , often referred to as _ dynamical heterogeneity _",
    "@xcite .",
    "most recent efforts to understand these extra relaxation pathways fall into two broad categories : analysis of microscopic molecular dynamics simulations in the light of free - energy landscape ideas @xcite , and study of coarse - grained models @xcite aimed to directly address dynamical heterogeneity . despite the new insights afforded by these methods , we believe that the success of mct in describing the viscous liquid state means that one should not abandon attempts to extend its validity beyond the ideal glass transition . indeed , several programmes along these lines have been carried out , either by avoiding some of the approximations of mct @xcite , introducing new decay modes into the full mct formalism ( creating ` extended mct ' or emct ) @xcite , or adding relaxation processes not easily described through mode - coupling to a simplified version of the theory ( see e.g.  refs @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we take a related route : we make a specific ad - hoc adjustment to a set of equations that , unmodified , are an accepted ` schematic ' representation of smct @xcite .",
    "the adjustment we propose is inspired by recent theoretical work @xcite which addresses not just whether , but _ how _ activated processes ( ` instantons ' ) can violate the central approximation of smct .",
    "the latter involves factoring a four - point correlator into the product of two two - point correlators @xcite .",
    "cates and ramaswamy argued that , in an instanton - dominated regime , the four - point correlator should be better approximated by a single two - point correlator .",
    "a crossover to a regime in which that approximation holds , in place of the mct one , can gradually weaken the density - density coupling and hence can switch off the feedback that drives the arrest .",
    "this line of reasoning gives a cut - off glass transition , but one with a different mathematical structure from those proposed in connection with various forms of emct @xcite .",
    "the resulting model structure is also different from that found by multiplying either the mct correlator or the mct memory function by an independent decay function .    below we explore in more depth the consequences of a crossover , on an ` instanton ' timescale @xmath0 , from a quadratic to a linear dependence of four - point correlators on two - point correlators .",
    "this we do within the framework of a schematic , single - mode model .",
    "the simplicity of this framework introduces several artificial features precluding any detailed comparison with experimental data ; however , a wide range of glassy relaxation scenarios can be found within this simple model . though not done here , this suggests that pursuit of similar ideas within a full ( multi - mode , wavevector - dependent ) mct could be a fruitful avenue of future research .",
    "section [ mct ] gives a sketch of the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition , and its schematic versions are outlined in sec .",

    "is cooled or compressed , the viscosity and , more generally , the relaxation times for density fluctuations in the system increase rapidly",
    ". as the glass transition is reached , unequal - time density correlators that would , in an ergodic material , decay to zero at late times are no longer able to do so on the timescale of the experiment . a proportion of the density fluctuations are then arrested or ` frozen ' , although the system remains amorphous .",
    "the theory describes this through a feedback mechanism driven by couplings among density fluctuations , often thought to be associated with the _ caging _ of a particle by its neighbors . to quantify the effect",
    ", mct uses the normalized autocorrelation functions of density fluctuations at wavevector @xmath4 , defined as @xmath5 where the angular brackets denote equilibrium averages .",
    "the @xmath6 evolve according to @xmath7 this is derived from the newtonian equations of motion for @xmath8 interacting particles and represents their averaged dynamics exactly .",
    "( alternatively , the second - derivative term may be dropped ; the equation then describes a system of interacting langevin particles with uncorrelated local noise terms .",
    "the latter can be used to describe a system of brownian colloids in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . )",
    "the microscopic frequencies @xmath9 may be calculated from the static properties of the liquid and @xmath10 is a regular damping term separated from the memory kernel @xmath11 so that the latter describes only the dominant effects near the glass transition .",
    "approximations must be made to allow @xmath11 to be calculated .",
    "the vital step in mct is the identification of the density fluctuation pairs @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) as the major contributions to the memory kernel ; those parts of @xmath11 uncorrelated with these are dropped .",
    "further approximations , including notably the factorization of the four - point correlation functions arising from these product modes , lead to an expression for @xmath11 whose only input is the mean density @xmath14 and structure factor @xmath15 of the equilibrium liquid state ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as the static correlations described by @xmath16 increase , the feedback becomes stronger , and the decay of @xmath17 stretches out to longer times . eventually ,",
    "at the ideal glass transition @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , the fluctuations never decay entirely , and @xmath20 .",
    "( the residual value @xmath21 is the @xmath4-dependent nonergodicity parameter . )",
    "@xmath16 remains regular at @xmath22 : mode - coupling theory does not require a thermodynamic singularity to trigger the glass transition .",
    "this approach has had remarkable success in modelling the detailed time- and wavevector - dependence of the @xmath17 as the glass transition is approached , especially in colloidal fluids @xcite , where it also provides a coherent description of a glass - to - glass transition between arrested phases dominated by inter - particle repulsion and attraction respectively @xcite .",
    "it successfully predicts the two - step decay of density correlations near the glass transition , where a fast initial relaxation towards a plateau ( extending to infinite times at @xmath22 ) is followed by a slower - than - exponential final decay .",
    "furthermore , several aspects of this relaxation are fixed by a single _ exponent parameter _",
    "@xmath23 , calculated from @xmath16 . despite the success of mode - coupling theory in describing the viscous liquid state , agreement between the asymptotic decay laws of smct and experiment rapidly worsens at temperatures around @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this problem is often attributed to the presence of additional relaxation processes not captured in the theory ( sometimes referred to as _ hopping _ in molecular systems ) .",
    "this school of thought argues that smct captures the physics of an _ ideal glass transition _",
    "( at @xmath25 ) which is avoided in reality but which would arise in a world where such additional processes did not exist ; worsening agreement at @xmath26 is then taken to signify a qualitative change in transport mechanism from collective to hopping processes ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "many features of the full ( wavevector - dependent ) smct can be captured by simple schematic models . in these ,",
    "[ mcteom ] is reduced to @xmath27 where all @xmath4-dependence has been dropped .",
    "this single correlator is usually associated with density fluctuations at the wavelength of the peak in the structure factor @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the full theory , there is no clear microscopic prescription for the form of @xmath28 in schematic models .",
    "the simplest form for the memory kernel giving a reasonably realistic picture of the glass transition is @xmath29 , with @xmath30 an adjustable coupling parameter . together with eqn .",
    "[ mcteom2 ] , this defines the @xmath31 , or leutheusser , model @xcite .",
    "the quadratic term is a simple representation of the density - density coupling in the full smct .",
    "the @xmath31 model gives a discontinuous jump of the nonergodicity parameter @xmath32 at a critical value of the control parameter ( @xmath33 ) ( a _ type b _",
    "transition ) , and also yields a good qualitative description of the characteristic two - step decay of @xmath34 in the approach to the glass transition .",
    "its ability to fit experimental data for @xmath34 is limited by the fact that the detailed form of the two - step decay is rather firmly fixed , and in some respects is unrealistic .",
    "in particular , the height of the intermediate - time plateau @xmath35 in @xmath34 is always @xmath36 in the liquid ( although this , and hence also the long - time limit @xmath37 , may be @xmath38 in the glass ) , and the slow ( @xmath1 ) decay at long times is described by a simple exponential rather than by some slower function ( most experimental data in this regime may be well fitted by stretched exponentials @xcite ) .    the @xmath31 model can be made more flexible by the addition of a linear term to the memory kernel , giving @xmath39 .",
    "this model , called @xmath40 @xcite , allows the plateau height @xmath35 and the form of the decay to and from the plateau to be adjusted , and also gives a ( close to ) stretched exponential form for the long - time relaxation . however , the functional form of the decay can not be varied independently of the plateau height , which itself is restricted to @xmath41 . note that although the quadratic term in @xmath42 has a clear analogue in the full smct , the same is not true of this linear term .",
    "however , the approach often taken in the literature on schematic models is to add terms to @xmath42 to access a particular arrest scenario even if terms of that order are not present in the full model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    a further enhancement to the data - fitting capabilities of schematic mct can be brought about by the introduction of a second correlator @xmath43 ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "this obeys an analogous equation to eqn .",
    "[ mcteom2 ] , and is coupled to the first correlator by a memory kernel @xmath44 the decay of @xmath43 is thus broadly fixed by that of @xmath34 , whereas @xmath43 has no effect on @xmath34 .",
    "various physical motivations hve been given for the use of this extra correlator .",
    "it was initially proposed to describe the motion of a tagged particle @xcite , and has since been associated with the correlations of a probing variable ( e.g.  dielectric loss ) and most recently with rotation - translation coupling @xcite .",
    "this model can be more freely tailored to fit data @xcite , and may also show an intermediate - time ( @xmath3 or johari - goldstein @xcite ) decay , in addition to the usual fast ( microscopic ) and slow ( @xmath1 ) processes .",
    "a glass transition , albeit a rather unrealistic one , is also present in the @xmath45 model , where @xmath46 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath37 does not have a jump as @xmath47 is varied but grows continuously for @xmath48 ( a _ type a _ transition ) , and vanishes for @xmath49 .",
    "there is no intermediate - time plateau in the correlator .",
    "the long - time relaxation may be very slow , and a power - law decay is seen close to the transition . the model can not produce stretched - exponential decay @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , standard mode - coupling theory predicts a characteristic two - step relaxation of density correlators near the glass transition .",
    "this is often said to be associated with the formation and breaking up of _ cages _ ; each particle being trapped in a cage of its neighbors for increasingly long times as the glass transition is approached .",
    "the broad features , and many of the finer details , of this mct scenario are seen in scattering and dielectric loss experiments on a wide range of substances ( see refs  @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however , many materials show more complex relaxation patterns , with three or more decay processes ( we refer to this as multi - step relaxation ) .",
    "notably , hard - sphere colloid @xcite experiments ( which provide some of the strongest experimental support for smct ) show a decay regime on the fluid side of the glass transition in which the deviations from smct fits to the slow @xmath1 process suggest an _ even slower _ relaxation at late times .",
    "this additional slow process at long times is also hinted at in microgel experiments @xcite , although here the @xmath1 relaxation is less well resolved .",
    "glassy relaxation at _ intermediate _ times in molecular systems often shows additional processes not accounted for by smct when applied to density correlators only ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "these relaxations are usually discussed in terms of the susceptibility spectrum @xmath50 ( measured in light - scattering experiments ) or the dielectric response @xmath51 .",
    "the former is given by the product of the frequency @xmath52 and the fourier cosine transform of @xmath34 .",
    "its peaks correspond to the troughs of @xmath53 ; that is , to each decay process .",
    "the peak shapes reveal the functional form of the relaxation ; in particular , exponential decay gives a symmetric ( lorentzian ) peak of width @xmath54 decades , whilst stretched exponentials appear broader and asymmetric .",
    "intermediate - frequency relaxations are often classed into two groups .",
    "the first of these comprises positive - curvature ` wings ' @xcite on the high - frequency side of the spectral peak corresponding to the @xmath1 process .",
    "the second group includes @xmath3 _ peaks _ @xcite , appearing between the initial fast and final @xmath1 relaxation processes .",
    "these weakly temperature - dependent @xcite peaks were initially attributed to the relaxation of intramolecular degrees of freedom ; however , they were subsequently shown to occur in a wide range of substances composed of rigid molecules @xcite and postulated to be a universal feature of glassy relaxation .",
    "the @xmath3 peak is broader and weaker than the @xmath1 peak , and tends to be rather symmetric if the frequency is plotted on a logarithmic scale @xcite .",
    "the extent to which wings and peaks are manifestations of a single underlying phenomenon has been the subject of much recent debate .",
    "on the one hand , some dielectric results show the simultaneous presence of both wing and @xmath3 features @xcite .",
    "one of these papers @xcite also finds a difference in pressure dependence between the wing and @xmath3 processes .",
    "in addition , other dielectric experiments show a connection between the excess wing and the final @xmath1 process , either by showing that they share the same ( strong ) temperature dependence @xcite , or through fitting both by a function with a single physical motivation @xcite .    in contrast , other experiments are able to transform a positive curvature wing into a negative curvature @xmath3 process .",
    "this can be achieved by varying the conditions of a single material , either through aging the sample @xcite or changing the temperature @xcite .",
    "such a transformation can also be observed by moving through a class of materials , for example by studying a sequence of alcohols with gradually decreasing hydrogen bonding @xcite , or more simply by changing the composition of a binary mixture @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is further complicated by subtle differences between the relaxation dynamics probed by different methods @xcite .",
    "although the excess wing has been seen in both dielectric loss @xcite and light scattering @xcite experiments , the @xmath3 peak has only ( to our knowledge ) been seen in dielectric measurements @xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanism underlying these intermediate - frequency processes remains obscure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions ) .",
    "it is usually attributed either to rotational ( and possibly translational ) motion in isolated regions ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or to purely rotational relaxation of all molecules ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although most discussion of @xmath3 relaxation is in the experimental literature , a number of theories containing intermediate - time processes have been proposed .",
    "the approach in which intermediate relaxations emerge most naturally is the ` coupling model ' @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 process is associated with the ` primitive ' ( i.e.  uncoupled ) relaxation time of this model , and a relation between the form of the final @xmath1 process and the @xmath3 relaxation time is predicted , in good agreement with experiment .    as mentioned in section [ schematic ] ,",
    "intermediate - time decays are present in schematic smct models with a second correlator introduced via eqn .",
    "[ mem ] @xcite .",
    "the use of an smct model to study such processes might be questioned @xcite on the grounds that intermediate - time features often appear around the mode - coupling @xmath22 , where smct is expected to break down ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "however , using this approach , excellent fits to optical kerr effect data including wing features above the estimated @xmath22 have been obtained @xcite . by increasing the couplings ,",
    "these wings were transformed into realistically broad and symmetric @xmath3 peaks , although these results correspond to lower temperatures than those considered in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 relaxation has also been studied @xcite using a simple memory equation , which ( in contrast to mode - coupling ) has a memory kernel with no dependence on the density correlators .",
    "instead , a kernel consisting of the sum of two exponentials ( decaying in time ) is used , and a gradual separation of @xmath1 and @xmath3 relaxation ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) as the couplings are increased is produced .",
    "the simple form of the kernel means that both these processes are purely exponential .",
    "note additionally that several systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) show multiple stretched - exponential @xmath1 processes , but these fall outside our scope .",
    "as discussed above , the ideal glass transition ( to a perfectly arrested state with @xmath55 ) predicted by smct is not observed in real glass formers .",
    "instead , it is cut off by relaxation processes not captured by the mode - coupling approximation .",
    "an important question is : what exactly goes wrong with smct in this region ?    for newtonian systems",
    "the smct equations can be derived by several routes , but one of these @xcite is particularly revealing , as discussed by cates and ramaswamy @xcite .",
    "this approach allows the memory function to be written formally as a sum of a ` standard ' contribution , which involves four - point density correlators , plus a second contribution derived from coupling of configurational to kinetic degrees of freedom .",
    "the standard contribution reduces ( essentially ) to the mct form when the four - point density correlators are factored into products of two - point correlators .",
    "cates and ramaswamy additionally gave arguments for why the second , nonstandard , term is negligible in the glassy regime . if their arguments are accepted , then for the ideal glass transition to be avoided , it is _ necessary _ that the factorization of the four - point correlator becomes a _ qualitatively _ wrong approximation as the transition is approached .",
    "interestingly , in any regime dominated by localized activated processes (  hopping \" ) , this approximation does indeed become qualitatively wrong @xcite . when hopping occurs in a system that would otherwise be fully arrested",
    ", the generic relaxation process in any local neighborhood involves a long wait while nothing happens .",
    "then , after some randomly distributed time , a large local change occurs that reconfigures the density nonperturbatively ( an  instanton \" ) .",
    "this decorrelates all powers of the density at the same instant .",
    "indeed , if such decorrelation is complete , one has @xmath56 : the four point correlator ( at least , the one involving squared local densities ) decays as the two - point correlator , not as its square .",
    "this is the extreme opposite of a gaussian fluctuation process , whereby @xmath14 correlations decay continuously by infinitesimal increments , and the factorization of the four - point correlator as adopted in smct is rigorously correct @xcite .    in a general glassy relaxation process",
    "some intermediate behavior can be expected ; for instance , if several instanton visits are required to achieve complete relaxation , rather than just one , a limiting approximation combining linear and quadratic terms may remain appropriate even as the ideal glass transition is approached . additionally ,",
    "while the squared - density correlator ( @xmath57 ) does enter some early forms of mct @xcite , this in fact describes the case of a perfectly flat @xmath16 .",
    "( equivalently , it describes a system where the direct correlation function @xmath58 , with @xmath59 is a @xmath60-function in real space . ) within smct , which addresses general forms for @xmath16 , the four point correlator entering the exact expression of @xcite for the memory function is not the autocorrelator of @xmath61 , but that of a bilinear convolution of densities with a kernel whose range is fixed by @xmath58 .",
    "this nonlocality , unless negligible on the ( uncertain ) length - scale of an instanton relaxation event , could also lead to a quadratic plus linear behavior of the relevant four - point correlator .",
    "based on these ideas , cates and ramaswamy @xcite argued that the a model of the cut - off glass transition might include a kernel in which quadratic terms are gradually replaced by linear ones , in such a manner that the system approaches the ideal glass state , acquiring some of its properties , before reverting to the liquid .",
    "a suitable choice is given by @xmath62 where @xmath47 and @xmath30 are _ time - dependent _ coefficients and @xmath0 is an `` instanton timescale '' .",
    "note that @xmath0 need not be as long as the typical waiting time for an instanton event : it describes the time scale beyond which incremental , collective decay modes are negligible compared to instanton - mediated relaxation . hence @xmath0 must lie well beyond the time for the plateau in @xmath34 to be reached but in principle need not be as long as its eventual decay .",
    "we note that this cutoff mechanism preserves an important prediction of smct  the growth of the plateau height on the glass side of the ideal transition with a square - root dependence on the distance from the transition line @xmath63 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "experimental data are consistent with this singularity @xcite .",
    "this model , which we explore in detail here , thus defines trajectories in the phase diagram of the @xmath40 model ( shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagfig ] ) , with @xmath64 as the curve parameter .",
    "as the system moves along such a trajectory , it will accumulate memory of all previous states along the path .",
    "we might thus expect its behavior to differ strongly from that seen in the pure @xmath40 model with parameters set at either the initial _ or the final _",
    "points on such a trajectory .",

    "trajectory ( a ) shows gradual replacement of quadratic by linear correlation . trajectory ( b ) remains close to the glass transition line at all times .",
    "we will associate ( a ) with colloidal systems , and ( b ) with molecular systems . ]    as is traditional with schematic models , we put constraints on the model parameters ( or here , the trajectory ) to ensure that the desired physics is recovered . to avoid permanent arrest , we must choose @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite , so that the system moves into the liquid state at long times @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagfig ] ) . to have a cut - off glass transition , rather than simply a crossover from one set of liquid - like parameters to another , we must set @xmath68 which ensures the system begins its trajectory within the ideal glass ( although we will also consider trajectories starting close to the ideal glass transition on the liquid side ) .",
    "we of course require the model to start with _ some _ quadratic correlations , so that @xmath69 .",
    "we also demand @xmath70 , so that _ some _ linear correlation remains at long times .    within the above constraints ,",
    "there is still considerable freedom in the choice of initial and final states ; in the path taken between them ; and in the time spent on different sections of that path .",
    "thus we may begin with an @xmath31 or @xmath40 model of the ideal glass , and leave differing amounts of linear and quadratic correlation in the final state . for the present , we shall restrict ourselves to straight paths in the @xmath71 plane of the general form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a crossover function satisfying @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath37 superscripts denote initial and final states respectively .",

    "this procedure is based on the fact that @xmath34 is fixed by @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it contains two important technical steps : the separation of slow and fast variations in the memory integral , and the use of decimation .",

    "@xcite , a rationale for retaining some quadratic coupling was given in section [ cutoff ] above .",
    "additionally , the connection between the full and schematic memory kernels is not completely clear , so that an endpoint with a reduced but non - zero quadratic coupling might in fact be the best schematic representation of a full @xmath4-dependent model with purely linear coupling ( rather as the @xmath40 model is , by common consent , the best schematic representation of the full model with purely quadratic coupling ) .",
    "one might further argue that , as soon as instanton processes have made the system fluid , the dynamics should again be determined by smct .",

    "this means that , on crossing the ideal glass line , @xmath34 falls from the glass plateau value to that of the liquid , leading to a decay at times @xmath117 .",

    "we might associate increasing coupling with increasing density and decreasing temperature , but it is not obvious how to be more precise than this .",
    "the fact that our intermediate - time process arises from the crossing of the ideal glass line implies that this relaxation should be present for all trajectories finishing on the liquid side of the line , including those that end only just within the liquid , so that the subsequent @xmath1 decay is pushed out to unobservably long times .",
    "this type of model has interesting properties which we now discuss , although these become increasingly remote from the original conception of the instanton - mediated cutoff .",
    "specifically , we are now talking about a model where the instanton relaxation only just manages to carry the parameters into the fluid phase , such that the resulting @xmath1 relaxation remains much slower than the instanton time itself .",
    "this behavior could perhaps arise at temperatures well below @xmath22 , but if so , decreasing temperature further should create a trajectory where even the final state lies within the ideal glass .",
    "this would cause not only the final divergence of the @xmath1 relaxation time ( which could be too long to measure far before that ) but also the divergence of the @xmath3-like relaxation time .    until this point is reached , however ,",
    "the @xmath3-like relaxation arising from the instanton cutoff mechanism should persist at all temperatures below the mode - coupling transition , even when the system is arrested ( no visible @xmath1 decay ) on experimental timescales . to demonstrate this , we plot ( in fig .",

    "however , there are a number of differences between the two classes of trajectory in the way the various adjustable parameters affect the relaxation .",
    "firstly , the role of the decay time @xmath0 can be different in the shorter trajectories .",
    "figure [ slow_alpha ] demonstrates this : here , @xmath0 sets the intermediate relaxation time , but the difference between this time and that of the @xmath1 relaxation is determined by the distance between the finishing point and the glass transition line .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath116 case , where the influence of the transition region is much weaker and the only way of significantly changing the timescale of the final relaxation on the glassy side of the ideal transition is through adjustment of @xmath0 .",
    "the second point concerns the crossover function @xmath73 .",
    "as discussed earlier , this strongly affects the relaxation at times @xmath133 : the timescale ( by construction ) of our intermediate - time process .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ expvpower ] : the use of a slower crossover function ( here , a power law @xmath129 ) broadens the intermediate peak .",
    "a theory of @xmath73 would be necessary in order to make detailed comparisons of a cut - off model with experimental data : at present , our rather narrow and asymmetric peaks are far from the broad and ( usually ) symmetric features seen in experiment .",
    "sections of spectra for exponential ( full line , narrower peak ) and power - law ( dotted line , broader peak ) crossover functions @xmath73 . in both cases , @xmath146 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath115 .",
    "these trajectories are chosen to give a well - separated intermediate - frequency process , and so finish very close to the glass transition line . ]",
    "we note that it is possible to obtain qualitatively similar relaxation patterns ( weak intermediate process followed by stronger @xmath1 decay ) regardless of the angle of approach to the glass transition line , even if the strength of the _ linear _ , rather than the quadratic coupling is reduced .",
    "although this moves even further away from our original theoretical motivation , it reinforces the view that the intermediate - time process is broadly insensitive to the details of the trajectory .",
    "finally , mindful of the fact that we have focused in this section exclusively on trajectories finishing close to the type b transition , we examine briefly the behavior as the final quadratic coupling is reduced back towards zero .",
    "figure [ diag4.01 ] shows a series of decays with starting point @xmath108 , @xmath115 and endpoints along a diagonal line running across liquid region of the phase diagram from @xmath162 to @xmath163 .",
    "the endpoints shown are @xmath164 ( lowest curve ) , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( highest curve ) .",
    "although the @xmath164 trajectory shows a marked @xmath3-like process , such a relaxation is completely absent from the @xmath165 trajectory , which ( despite finishing rather close to the type b transition ) gives a straight line in the logarithmic plot corresponding to a slightly stretched exponential decay .",
    "the appearance of the intermediate - time process thus requires the trajectory to finish very close to the type b transition ( although this requirement is less strict for higher initial coupling constants e.g.  @xmath168 ) . for the ` central ' endpoint at @xmath166 , the influence of the type a transition is already noticeable , and",
    "the additional slow process at long times has started to appear .",

    "we have found no trajectories showing _ both _ the final slow process and a @xmath3-like relaxation .",

    "we have studied a simple schematic mode - coupling equation with cutoff , based on the well - studied @xmath40 model but with coupling constants in the memory kernel @xmath42 that themselves have explicit @xmath79-dependence .",
    "the quadratic coefficient in the expression relating the memory kernel to the density - density correlator gradually decays , cutting off the ideal glass transition at long times .",
    "this leads to two new decay scenarios , both of which qualitatively resemble experimental data in different regimes .    in the first of these scenarios , the decay of the quadratic coupling is complete , leaving a purely linear memory kernel at long times .",
    "this is close to the conception of cates and ramaswamy concerning the likely form of the memory function in the hopping - dominated regime @xcite . for systems that standard mct would predict to lie within or close to the ideal glass , but where a long time @xmath1 decay is nonetheless observable on experimental timescales , this can result in decay curves showing an addition slow relaxation feature at long times .",
    "although the experimental data is not conclusive , such features are hinted at in several of the earliest papers on hard - sphere colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "there , they appeared as an upward deviation between @xmath17 and the relaxation predicted by a smct calculation with parameters shifted somewhat , so as to make the @xmath1 time scale finite .    in the second scenario ,",
    "the decay of the quadratic coupling again carries one through the ideal glass transition line , but saturates at values not far from that line so that the final @xmath1 process does indeed resemble the mct prediction with shifted parameters .",
    "theoretical motivation for this type of model is less clear , but the results are intriguing nonetheless . specifically , a weaker relaxation process appears at intermediate times , as a precursor of the final @xmath1 relaxation .",
    "this may be connected with the @xmath3 relaxation and/or the `` excess wing '' seen in many molecular glass - formers ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , whose appearance is clearly connected to an underlying ideal mode - coupling glass transition ( cf .",
    "our schematic model predicts the @xmath3-like relaxation to persist even as the final @xmath1 relaxation time becomes unmeasurably long .",
    "this second scenario requires that significant quadratic coupling remains within the memory function even as @xmath139 .",
    "if this does happen , one might expect the strength of this coupling to increase as one moves further into the glass , just as the initial ( @xmath173 ) quadratic coupling does ( unless there is a balancing compensation in the strength of the decay ) .",
    "the result would be that at some low enough temperature the @xmath1 relaxation time actually diverges ; if so , that of the @xmath3-like process does also .",
    "this is because the intermediate timescale corresponds to that on which the parameter decay takes the system across the ideal glass transition , and a divergent @xmath1 relaxation time signifies that this line is never crossed .",
    "although the case for residual quadratic coupling within the schematic model remains somewhat unclear , several arguments in favour were presented in sections [ decay ] and [ mixed ] .",
    "an additional , speculative idea is that a stronger residual coupling would result from stronger static correlations in the system , perhaps due to intermolecular attractions ( e.g.  hydrogen bonding ) , as often occur in molecular glasses . in that case , one might find that in hard - sphere glasses , where intermolecular attraction is absent , the reduction of quadratic coupling becomes the slowest process in the system , and determines its long - time behavior ( scenario 1 above ) .",
    "in the molecular glasses , where attraction and bonding may enhance arrest , it is only the second slowest , and manifests itself as an intermediate relaxation ( scenario 2 ) .",
    "the cut - off procedure studied here applies regardless of the microscopic dynamics of the system ( see discussions in refs .",
    "in particular , we have introduced no coupling to density _ currents _ @xcite , which are present in newtonian but not brownian systems .",
    "in fact , the experimental results on colloidal systems @xcite that suggest an extra decay process at long times ( as predicted by our model ) could be taken to indicate the presence of non - mct relaxation processes in simple systems with brownian dynamics and hard - sphere interactions .",
    "a criticism that might be made of our work is that the memory kernel of our model now contains an extra non - microscopic relaxation process introduced by hand ( in contrast to smct ) and so the fact that we predict an extra relaxation process in @xmath34 is hardly surprising .",
    "however , we believe that our approach has sufficient theoretical motivation @xcite , and captures enough interesting features of glassy relaxation , for its study to be justified .",
    "we also have no method of calculating the relaxation time @xmath0 , which , for example , precludes a study of the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath3 relaxation times",
    ". however , since @xmath0 is connected with the breakdown of mct , we do not expect it to be calculable by mct - like methods ; to whatever extent instanton dynamics ( hopping ) is actually involved in the @xmath3 process , agreement with models that omit it must be fortuitous .",
    "our model also has several limitations inherited directly from the @xmath40 model : these restrictions in plateau height , in the form of the @xmath1 decay , and in the connections between the two .",
    "the form of the @xmath40 phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phasediagfig ] ) is also rather specific to this model @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that the broad features of our results should be independent of the details of fig .",
    "[ phasediagfig ] .",
    "the appearance of the ` slower - than-@xmath1 ' process in our first relaxation scenario depends only on the presence of significant linear correlations at long times , not on the form of the path taken across the phase diagram .",
    "as discussed towards the end of section [ results ] , the intermediate process is produced whenever the system crosses the type b transition line and remains sufficiently close to it , regardless of the details of the trajectory .",
    "given the sensitivity of the predicted intermediate - time relaxation to the crossover function @xmath73 , theoretical work on the likely form of this would be useful .",
    "this might allow connections to be made between our approach and facilitated dynamics models @xcite , which provide information on the behavior of strongly and weakly correlated regions as a system relaxes .",
    "nonetheless , the lack of microscopic detail in our model might be seen as an advantage .",
    "for instance , it provides a simple mechanism by which a single generic correlator can acquire an intermediate - time relaxation ( triggered by the ideal mct transition and persisting even if the system is arrested on experimental timescales ) , without appealing to any detailed properties of the material or a coupling to a probing variable .",
    "this is intriguing given recent experimental results @xcite suggesting an intermediate - time process in a metallic glass .",
    "these experiments are not based on scattering or dielectric loss , but instead involve mechanical measurements of the shear modulus .",
    "furthermore , the atoms of these materials ( at least with respect to their slow dynamics at high densities ) are expected to behave as spheres with almost purely metallic interactions @xcite .",
    "since our model predicts a separate intermediate - time process in the main @xmath34 , rather than in a second probing correlator @xcite , it also implies that intermediate - time decay should be observable in simulations , where @xmath34 is measured directly .",
    "however , resolving an intermediate - time process in simulations may prove technically difficult : these decays are often small in amplitude and the intermediate - time regime may be affected by oscillations caused by the short - time dynamics ( although this might be avoided by the use of overdamped dynamics ) or the finite size of the simulation box @xcite .",
    "more generally , we believe that the wide range of relaxation scenarios predicted by our model motivates continued investigations along these lines . given that smct two - correlator approaches concentrate only on temperatures above @xmath22 @xcite , a possible future direction would be to add an extra correlator to our model and attempt to fit data at lower temperatures .",
    "this might provide , for instance , a mechanism by which both wing and peak features may be produced in the same spectrum , as seen in the experiments of refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although far more complicated to implement , an extension of the same approach to address non - schematic , wavevector - dependent description would also be highly desirable .",

    "<S> it disappears when the initial as well as the final quadratic coupling lies on the liquid side of the glass transition , but remains present even when the final coupling is only just inside the liquid ( so that the @xmath1 relaxation time is finite , but too long to measure ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are suggestive of how , in a cut - off glass , the underlying ` ideal ' glass transition predicted by mode - coupling theory can remain detectable through qualitative features in dynamics . </S>"
