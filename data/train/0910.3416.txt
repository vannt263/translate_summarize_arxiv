    "when studying heavy - ion collisions at non - relativistic energies , multifragmentation can be observed for the most central ones , in a range of projectile - ion bombarding energies from tens mev / a up to a few hundreds mev / a , depending of the properties of the nuclei under consideration .",
    "many issues of this phenomenon are still under discussion , in particular concerning the stage at which it occurs in the evolution of a reaction , e.g. if a nuclear system undergoing multifragmentation is or not equilibrated , how a simultaneous break - up in multiple fragments can occur , and if the multifragmentation is the result of a phase - transition .    according to the currently most believable scenario , during the overlapping stage of heavy - ion collisions ( typical time @xmath0 100 fm / c ) matter can undergo compression , leading to large excitation energies . as a consequence ,",
    "the blob of nuclear matter starts to expand and can go on expanding down to sub - saturation densities ( @xmath1 @xmath0 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the normal nuclear matter density ) and reach temperatures @xmath0 3 - 8 mev , where it becomes unstable and breaks up into multiple fragments .",
    "these conditions are typical of a liquid - gas coexistence region  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the open issues is if equilibration is reached in these reactions .",
    "a statistical description of multifragmentation is based on this assumption .",
    "a dynamical description of multifragmentation instead is not based on this assumption .",
    "difficulties in coming to a non - controversial conclusion are largely due to the fact that most of the experimental data refer to patterns of particles detected just in the last stage of the reactions , involving channels feeded by the sequential decays which heavily affect and modify the primary fragment distribution .",
    "multifragmentation can be distinguished from other decay channels on the basis of the excitation energy : a typical scenario of small excitation energies ( e @xmath3 2 - 3 mev / a ) is characterized by the formation of a compound - like system and by its evolution through binary sequential decays ( evaporation / fission ) , whereas for high excitation energies ( e @xmath4 3 mev / a ) multifragmentation in a finite volume and a simultaneous break - up into multiple fragments can occur . the excitation energy is indeed related to the mass asymmetry @xmath5 : in case of symmetric central reactions the compression is responsible of the high excitation energy , whereas in case of asymmetric reactions only a partial compression can occur and a large part of the excitation energy appears in the form of thermal energy  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "multifragmentation is tipically driven by the following expansion .",
    "due to its mentioned features , multifragmentation , occurring during the phase of expansion of the nuclear system formed by an ion - ion ( central ) collision , allows to study the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) at subnormal nuclear densities .",
    "in particular , it is possible to infer useful information concerning the symmetry energy and its density dependence , by investigating the isotopic yield distributions of the emitted fragments .",
    "the isoscaling technique , based on the analysis of isotopic yield ratios obtained in reactions with a different isospin asimmetry , has been developed with this purpose .",
    "after an overview of the models to study multifragmentation in section  [ section2 ] , and a brief presentation of the one used in this work in subsection  [ subsection2.1 ] , examples of its application in the isoscaling technique and in the reconstruction of multifragmenting sources at energies of a few tens mev / a are provided in subsection  [ subsection3.1 ] and  [ subsection3.2 ] , respectively . finally , our perspectives on further applications of our model are drawn in section  [ section4 ] .",
    "one can distinguish between    * dynamical models : some of them are 1-body approaches , inspired to the buu / bnv / landau - vlasov transport theory .",
    "alternatively , n - body approaches have been developed , such as the qmd / amd / fmd .",
    "n - body approaches are very powerful in the description of the simultaneous break - up of a nuclear system in multiple fragments , since they preserve correlations among nucleons . * statistical models : they assume to work with an equilibrated excited source at freeze - out ( thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "taking into account that the nuclear system undergoes an expansion , leading to decreasing densities , down to subnormal values , the freeze - out  @xcite occurs when the mutual nuclear interaction among fragments can be neglected .",
    "statistical models have been worked out both in the grand - canonical framework ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in the micro - canonical framework .",
    "the most widespread among the last ones is the smm  @xcite and its modifications ismm  @xcite and smm - tf  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the onset of multifragmentation according to dynamical models is different from the description of multifragmentation according to statistical models .",
    "in fact , in the statistical models a source in thermal equilibrium is assumed to fragment .",
    "this means that memory effects concerning how the source has been originated are neglected . on the other hand , in the dynamical models",
    "multifragmentation is a fast process : the involved nucleons have not the time to come to equilibrium .",
    "fragments originate from the density fluctuations ( nucleon - nucleon correlations ) due to collisions in the ion - ion overlapping stage , which survive the expansion phase ( memory effects ) . the chemical composition of hot fragments is expected to play a role in helping to disentangle the nature ( dynamical / statistical ) of the multifragmentation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "different models reproduce different features of the collisions with different success .",
    "a mixed model , inspired to the qmd dynamical approach to describe the fast stage of ion - ion collisions and to a statistical approach to describe the further decay of the multiple primary excited fragments produced by qmd down to their ground state , has been used to obtain the results presented in this work . due to the crucial role of dynamics , as supported by our results , in the following we mainly concentrate on the description of the dynamical aspects of multifragmentation .      in these microscopic models a nucleus is considered a set of mutually interacting nucleons .",
    "the propagation of each nucleon occurs according to a classical hamiltionian with quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , nucleons are described by gaussian wave packets .",
    "each of them moves under the effects of a potential given by the sum of the contribution of all other nucleons ( 2-body effects ) .",
    "furthermore , when two nucleons come very close to each other , they can undergo elastic collisions ( nucleon - nucleon stochastic scattering cross - sections ) with pauli blocking .",
    "a proper treatment of antisymmetrization is implemented in amd  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", qmds do not provide any antisymmetrization of the nuclear wave - function .",
    "an approximate effect can be obtained through the inclusion in the hamiltonian of a pauli potential term , or through the implementation of specific constraints .    still open questions in molecular dynamics approaches concern the functional form of the nucleon - nucleon potential ( each working group who developed a molecular dynamics code has its preferred choice of terms ) , the potential parameters and their relation to the nuclear matter eos .",
    "nowaday , many groups prefer parameter sets leading to a soft eos .",
    "anyway , there are open questions concerning the symmetry term  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a stiff dependence for this term means that the symmetry energy always increases with increasing densities . on the other hand",
    ", a soft dependence means that the symmetry energy decreases at high densities . at present",
    ", a stiff dependence seems more reliable than a soft one .",
    "many uncertainties come from the fact that our observations are mainly based on symmetric nuclear matter ( n / z @xmath0 1 ) near normal nuclear density ( @xmath0 0.16 @xmath6 ) , since it is difficult to obtain highly asymmetric nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratories . on the other hand these studies are crucial to understand features of astrophysical objects ( such as neutron star formation and structure ) , where conditions of extreme neutron - proton asymmetry can be present .",
    "other open issues concern the gaussian width , the use of in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross - sections instead of free nucleon - nucleon cross - sections ( in qmd the free choice is usually implemented , whereas in the amd the in - medium choice has been implemented ) , the question of how long the dynamical simulation has to be carried over and the problem of the development of a fully relativistic approach ( on the last point see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a qmd code has been developed by us  @xcite in fortran 90 .",
    "it includes a 3-body repulsive potential and a surface term ( attractive at long distances and repulsive at short distances ) .",
    "pauli blocking is implemented by means of the comd constraint  @xcite .",
    "neutron and proton are fully distinguished by means of a simmetry term and an isospin dependent nucleon - nucleon stochastic scattering cross - section .",
    "the kinematics is relativistic and attention is paid to the conservation of key quantities ( total energy / momentum , etc . ) in each ion - ion collision .",
    "simulations are performed by means of our code from the ion - ion overlapping stage up to t @xmath0 200 - 300 fm / c ( fast stage of the reaction ) .",
    "the description of the de - excitation of the excited fragments present at the end of the fast stage is obtained through the coupling of our qmd with the statistical model taken from the peanut module available in the fluka monte carlo code  @xcite in a version for the g95 compiler .",
    "up to now , the qmd + fluka interface has been tested in the collisions of ions with charge up to z=86 ( radon isotopes ) , providing interesting results ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the isoscaling technique , already mentioned in section  [ section1 ] , is based on ratio of yields taken in multifragmentation reactions with similar total size , but different isospin asymmetries ( @xmath7 ) / ( @xmath8 )  @xcite : @xmath9 the numerator of this formula refers to the yield of a given fragment ( @xmath10 ) obtained from a neutron rich nucleus - nucleus reaction system , whereas the denominator refers to the yield of the same fragment from a neutron poor ( more symmetric ) reaction at the same energy .",
    "@xmath11 is related to the symmetry energy and is increasingly larger for couple of reactions with increasingly different isospin composition @xmath12 .    in particular ,",
    "we have considered the neutron rich systems ar + fe ( @xmath12 = 1.18 ) and ar + ni ( @xmath12 = 1.13 ) with respect to the neutron poor system ca + ni ( @xmath12 = 1.04 )",
    ". among other authors , these systems have been previously studied by  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "isotopic yield ratios for light fragment ( z @xmath13 8) emission have been obtained from our qmd + fluka simulations for the couple of reactions ar + ni / ca + ni and ar + fe / ca + ni at 45 mev / a projectile bombarding energy . when plotted in the logarithmic plane , isotopic yield ratios for each fixed @xmath14 turn out to be approximately linear , with a slope given by a @xmath11 , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . as for the isoscaling parameter @xmath11 ,",
    "our simulations give the following insights :    * the results of our analysis are quite sensitive to the number of isotopes included in the linear fit , at fixed @xmath14 ( i.e. to the goodness of the gaussian approximation to the fragment isotopic distribution ) .",
    "* @xmath11 differs with @xmath14 , in agreement with  @xcite , which claims that isoscaling is observed for a variety of reaction mechanisms , from multifragmentation to evaporation to deep inelastic scattering , with different slopes in the logarithmic plane .",
    "* @xmath11 is larger for the couple of reactions with larger difference in the isospin compositions ( @xmath15 - @xmath16 ) .",
    "* our average values @xmath11 = 0.18 for ar + ni / ca + ni and @xmath11 = 0.31 for ar + fe / ca + ni are larger than the experimental values  @xcite , but the comparison is not so meaningful , since it is largely affected by the fact that we include fragments emitted in all directions in our preliminary analysis , whereas in the experiment only fragments emitted at 44@xmath17 were selected . * @xmath11 turns out to be affected by the choice of the impact parameter and decreases significantly when selecting only the most central events . * @xmath18 at the end of the overlapping stage can be larger than @xmath11 at the end of the full simulation by no more than 20% , at least for the reaction systems under study .    as far as the emissions at preequilibrium",
    "are concerned , our simulations lead to the following results :    * for central collisions of ca + ni the yield of emitted protons turns out to be larger than the yield of emitted neutrons by 20% . for central collisions of ar + ni and",
    "ar + fe , on the other hand , the yield of emitted protons turns out to be lower than the yield of emitted neutrons by 10 - 15% . * for each of the three systems under study , the fragment asymmetry of the liquid phase @xmath19 at the end of the preequilibrium stage turns out to be lower than the corresponding value at @xmath20 , in qualitative agreement with the amd simulations  @xcite . *",
    "no traces of isospin fractionation appear , expected indeed for systems with an higher @xmath12 content ( e.g. @xmath21ca + @xmath21ca ) .",
    "the dependence of our results on the projectile bombarding energy is currently under study , by considering the same reactions at different bombarding energies .",
    "multifragmentation has been observed in nb + mg reactions at a 30 mev / a projectile bombarding energy in an experiment performed at the indra detector by the indra + chimera collaborations  @xcite .",
    "event selection has been performed , according to experimental cuts on the momentum along the beam axis , @xmath22 , and on the angular acceptance of the indra detector , @xmath23 <",
    "@xmath24 < @xmath25 .",
    "the selected events have then been assigned to different regions , corresponding to portions of the plane identified by the total transverse energy and the total multiplicity of charged particles detected in each event .",
    "three regions have been singled out this way , as shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "we have applied the same selection procedure by implementing proper cuts and filters on the simulated events obtained by our qmd + fluka .",
    "the selected theoretical events are plotted in fig .",
    "[ nostrafigura1 ] , which can be directly compared with fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and turns out to be in good agreement .",
    "the events plotted in the t1 region ( red ) are the less dissipative ones ( more peripheral collisions ) , whereas the events in the t3 region ( blue ) correspond to more dissipative ( central ) collisions .        for each of the three regions , average values of interesting quantities",
    "have been obtained both in the experiment and in the theoretical simulations .",
    "our results , concerning the transverse energy , the multiplicity of charged particles , the velocity and the charge of the biggest residual averaged over all events belonging respectively to the t1 , t2 and t3 regions are shown in table  [ tabellagenerale ] .",
    "as far as the average transverse energy and multiplicity of charged particle are concerned , the results of our simulations turn out to be in good agreement with the experimental data , within the experimental uncertainties , in the region t1 and t2 , corresponding respectively to peripheral and semiperipheral collisions , whereas in case of central collisions the theoretical average transverse energy underestimates the experimental one and the theoretical multiplicity of charged particles slightly overestimates the experimental result . on the other hand , as for the properties of the largest residual , the results of the theoretical simulations show good agreement with experimental data especially for the most central collisions , belonging to the t3 region , whereas for the more peripheral ones the theory overestimates the velocity and the charge of the largest residual .",
    "these results , considered all together , seem to point out to the fact that in the experiment the interacting nuclei are slightly more stopped than in the simulation .",

    "the qmd model developed in milano and coupled to the de - excitation module of the monte carlo fluka code has been used to study reactions between ions of intermediate mass which exhibit multifragmentation features .",

    "further studies at non relativistic energies that we are going to perform with our theoretical simulation tool concern :    * the isospin distillation effect : it occurs in the multifragmentation of charge - asymmetric systems , and leads to imf fragments ( liquid ) more symmetric with respect to the initial matter , and light fragments ( gas ) more neutron rich .",
