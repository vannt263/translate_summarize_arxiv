    "using particles in a manner similar to surfactants in order to stabilize emulsions is very attractive in particular for the food- , cosmetics- , and medical industry to stabilize , e.g. barbecue sauces and sun cremes or in order to produce sophisticated ways to deliver drugs at the right position in the human body .",
    "the microscopic processes leading to the commercial interest can be understood by assuming an oil - water mixture . without any additives ,",
    "phase separation would take place and the oil would float on top of the water . adding small particles , however , causes these particles to diffuse to the interface which is being stabilized due to a reduced surface energy . if for example individual droplets of one phase are covered by particles , such systems are also referred to as `` pickering emulsions '' and are known since the beginning of the last century  @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting properties of such emulsions are the blocking of ostwald ripening and the rheological properties due to irreversible particle adsorption at interfaces as well as interface bridging due to particle monolayers  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in particles suspended in multiphase or multicomponent flows  @xcite , which led to the discovery of a new material type , the `` bicontinous interfacially jammed emulsion gel '' ( bijel )  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the bijel was predicted in 2005 by stratford et al .",
    "@xcite and experimentally confirmed by herzig et al . in 2007  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to pickering emulsions which consist of unconnected particle stabilised droplets distributed in a second continuous fluid phase , the bijel shows an interface between two continuous fluid phases which is covered by particles .",
    "since the particles used for stabilization have a larger size than surfactant molecules and do not present any amphiphilic properties , concepts developed for the description of surfactant stabilized systems are often not applicable . instead",
    ", theoretical models have to be developed and experiments have to be performed which consider the specific properties of particle - stabilized systems . these include the particle s contact angle , the strong interparticle capillary forces , or the ph value and electrolyte concentration of the solvents  @xcite . however , even today our quantitative understanding of solid stabilized emulsions is still far from satisfactory .",
    "computer simulations are promising to understand the dynamic properties of particle stabilized multiphase flows .",
    "however , the shortcomings of traditional simulation methods quickly become obvious : a suitable simulation algorithm is not only required to deal with simple fluid dynamics but has to be able to simulate several fluid species while also considering the motion of the particles and the fluid - particle interactions .",
    "some recent approaches trying to solve these problems utilize the lattice boltzmann method for the description of the solvents  @xcite .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method can be seen as an alternative to conventional navier stokes solvers and is well established in the literature .",
    "it is attractive for the current application since a number of multiphase and multicomponent models exist which are comparably straightforward to implement  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method has been combined with a molecular dynamics algorithm to simulate arbitrarily shaped particles in flow and is commonly used to study the behavior of particle - laden single phase flows  @xcite .",
    "a few groups combined multiphase lattice boltzmann solvers with the known algorithms for suspended particles  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow an alternative approach : we present a method based on the multicomponent lattice boltzmann model of shan and chen  @xcite which allows the simulation of multiple fluid components with surface tension .",
    "our model generally allows arbitrary movements and rotations of arbitrarily shaped hard shell particles .",
    "it does not require fluid - filled particles and thus does not suffer from unphysical behavior caused by oscillations of the inner fluid  @xcite .",
    "further , it allows an arbitrary choice of the particle wettability  one of the most important parameters for the dynamics of multiphase suspensions  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : after a description of the shan - chen approach for multicomponent lattice boltzmann simulations and an extension of the lattice boltzmann method to simulate suspensions , a way to combine the two methods is proposed .",
    "the influence of the parameters of the model on the contact angle as a measure of wettability is studied in the following section .",
    "then the suitability of the new method is tested by performing a detailed study of the formation of bijels and pickering emulsions .",
    "the dynamics of the fluid solvents is simulated by a multicomponent lattice boltzmann model following the approach of shan and chen  @xcite . here , each component follows a lattice boltzmann equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the single particle distribution function for component @xmath2 in the direction @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at a discrete lattice position @xmath5 and at timestep @xmath6 . in this work",

    "bounce back boundary conditions reflect the incoming distributions at a site back to where they came from , so that the streaming step is modified to @xmath38 for all @xmath39 where @xmath40 is not a solid node to @xmath41 for all @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a solid node . here",
    ", @xmath42 is defined as the index corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "this results in a no - slip boundary located halfway between the fluid and the solid node .",
    "the change of momentum of the fluid that is reflected at the boundary has to be compensated by a momentum change of the particle itself as given by @xmath44 as we assume the length of a time step @xmath45 to be @xmath46 this corresponds to a force @xmath47 and a torque @xmath48 on the particle . here ,",
    "@xmath49 is the vector pointing from the center of the particle to the site of the reflection .",

    "it is therefore corrected as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the velocity of the particle surface on which the fluid is reflected .",
    "this effect also leads to a change in transfered momentum , so that the force acting on the particle is @xmath52 when the particle moves over the lattice , individual lattice sites can be either occupied by it in front of the particle or be released at its back . in case of newly occupied sites ,",
    "the fluid on the site is deleted and its momentum transfered to the particle by adding @xmath53 in case of the particle vacating a lattice site new fluid is created with the initial fluid density and the velocity of the particle surface @xmath51 at the corresponding site : @xmath54 to satisfy conservation of momentum this again leads to a force on the particle , @xmath55    interactions between particles can be taken into account similar to standard molecular dynamics implementations . in the current paper , we only consider hertzian contact forces to mimic hard spheres and a lubrication correction to correct for the limitations of the lattice boltzmann method to describe the hydrodynamics properly on scales below the lattice resolution . when particles collide the resulting forces",
    "are derived from the hertzian potential  @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 being a constant  @xcite .",
    "when two particles move towards each other the lubrication interaction between them results in a force separating the particles .",
    "if there is not at least one lattice site between the particles to resolve the flow , this force is not properly reproduced by the simulation and a lubrication correction has to be added as given by @xmath58 \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right| - 2r_\\textnormal{par } }   - 1     \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the vector connecting the particle centers and @xmath60 is their respective velocity  @xcite .",

    "in order to develop a simulation algorithm for particles in multicomponent flows the previously described methods can be combined as described in the current section . first , when extending the coupling between particles and fluid to multiple components the treatment of lattice sites that are uncovered by the moving particle has to be adapted .",
    "in the original algorithm for a single fluid , such sites are filled with the initial fluid density @xmath64 .",
    "however , re - initializing such sites with multiple fluid components can lead to artefacts since it is not a priori the case that the correct fluid composition should correspond to the initial state of the simulation . for example",
    ", one kind of fluid could appear in a region where only the other fluid is present . to prevent such artefacts we use the average surrounding fluid density @xmath65 where @xmath66 are all indices @xmath39 for which @xmath67 is a non - particle site .",

    "the forces on the fluid outside the particles are calculated as before with the virtual fluid being treated like a regular fluid in the shan - chen force computation .",
