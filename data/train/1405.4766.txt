    "in this problem , we attempt to reconstruct the _ conductivity _ @xmath1 in a steady state heat equation of the cooling fin on a cpu .",

    "@xmath5    the cpu is connected to the cooling fin along the bottom half of the left edge of the fin .",
    "we use the robin boundary conditions ( detailed in @xcite ) :    @xmath6    our data in this problem is the set of boundary points of the solution to ( [ eq : heatpde ] ) , which we compute using a standard finite difference scheme for an @xmath7 mesh ( here @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) .",
    "we denote the correct value of @xmath1 by @xmath10 and the data by @xmath11 . in order to reconstruct @xmath10",
    ", we will take a guess @xmath12 , solve the forward problem using @xmath12 and compare those boundary points to @xmath11 by implementing the metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( or mhmcmc ) .",
    "priors will need to be established to aid in the reconstruction , as comparing the boundary points alone is insufficient .",
    "markov chains produce a probability distribution of possible solutions ( in this case conductivities ) that are most likely given the observed data ( the probablility of reaching the next step in the chain is entirely determined by the current step ) .",
    "the algorithm is as follows ( @xcite ) .",
    "given @xmath13 , @xmath14 can be found using the following :    1 .",
    "generate a candidate state @xmath12 from @xmath13 with some distribution @xmath15 .",

    "the algorithm is highly efficient , and the reconstructed value will consistently converge to that of the solution to within @xmath27 .",
    "+ in order to approximate a nonconstant @xmath10 , the obvious choice is a pointwise change , at each iteration we add @xmath27 to a random entry of @xmath13 , thus genrating @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , systematic errors occur at the boundary points of our reconstruction ( they tend to rarely change from their initial position ) . + in order to sidestep this , we use a gridwise change ; change a square of the mesh ( chosen at random as well ) by adding @xmath27 to the four corners of said square . while this fixes the boundary problem , another major issue which arises from a non - uniform change is that the reconstruction will be marred with  spikes \" , which we must iron out .",
    "to aid in ironing out the wrinkles in the reconstruction we use  priors \" .",
    "priors generally require some knowledge of the quantity we wish to find , and will add a term to ( [ eq : alpha3 ] ) . naturally , the more unassuming the prior , the more applicable the algorithm .",
    "this applicability will be tested as often as possible throughout these tests .",
    "the first prior compares the sum of the differences between adjacent points of @xmath10 to those of @xmath12 ( keping the spikes in check ) , and is given by    @xmath32    @xmath33    and modifying ( [ eq : alpha3 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath34    so the guess is most likely if @xmath13 and @xmath12 are similarily smooth ( ie , @xmath35 ) , if an iteration gives a @xmath12 that is noticeably less smooth than the last accepted iteration , we are less likely to accept it .",
    "+ as an initial test for the smoothness prior developed above , we attempt the gridwise change on a constant conductivity ( @xmath36 , using @xmath37 ) . while we can still see the problem at the boundary points , they are limited to being a noticeable nuisance as oppposed to adamantly ruining an otherwise accurate reconstruction ( whose mean comes to within @xmath38 of @xmath39 ) .",
    "the next step is therefore to test the algorithm on a non - constant conductivity .      as a simple nonconstant trial",
    ", we look at a tilted plane with constant slope , given by @xmath40 once again , we take @xmath30 to be a matrix of all @xmath31s and @xmath37 .",
    "the boundary points again have trouble increasing from @xmath31 to the desired values , and in so doing lower the mean value of the reconstruction ; though we still consistentily get to within about @xmath41 of the solution ( in @xmath42 iterations )",
    ".     tilted plane we wish to reconstruct , and a reconstruction using the smoothness prior.,height=188 ]    we now attempt to reconstruct a more complicated conductivity : a gaussian well .",
    "+ the gaussian well is the first real challenge that the algorithm will face , and will be the main focus of the rest of the paper as it contains different regions which require different priors .",
    "it is given by the following equation    @xmath43}{0.2}}}\\right)}}\\ ] ]    this conductivity represents a much more significant challenge , with both flat regions , and regions with steep slopes .",
    "after several trials , the optimal @xmath44s were found to be between @xmath31 and @xmath45 , though obataining a specific value for which the reconstruction is best is impossible due to the high innaccuracy of the algorithm when faced with this well .",
    "gaussian well we wish to reconstruct , and a reconstruction using the smoothness prior.,height=188 ]    there is an evident need , at this point , for much more precision .",
    "we turn once again to priors , this time developing one that will look at the slopes of the reconstruction .",
    "one of the main concerns in implementing a new prior is the generality mentioned earlier . in theory , one could use a prior that only accepts gaussian wells of the form we have here , but that code would not be very versatile .",
    "we therefore try to keep our slope prior as general as possible . in keeping with this , we look at the ratios of adjacent slopes , both in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions , as follows :    @xmath48    @xmath49    and define    @xmath50    @xmath51    ( where @xmath52 is @xmath53 ) + the generality of these prior terms comes from the fact that they go to @xmath54 so long as the conductivity does nt change its mind .",
    "it is equally  happy \" with a constant slope as it is with slopes that , say , double , at each grid point . it should be noted that the formulas above break down for regions where we have very small slopes adjacent to large ones , where one ratio goes to @xmath54 while the other grows very large .",
    "nevertheless , we now set    @xmath55    with this new prior , we define    @xmath56    and use that in the acceptance step of the mhmcmc algorithm .      again , as a first test of the algorithm , we test it on the tilted plane .",
    "the reconstructions reach the same precision in @xmath42 iterations as we had with only the smoothness prior , so we have not yet implemented anything that is too problem - specific to the gaussian well .",
    "+ the initial result of the test on the well is arguably substantially better , but still rather imprecise . in an attempt to see more clearly",
    ", we make the mesh finer ( @xmath57 ) . in addition , we set @xmath30 to be a matrix of all @xmath0s",
    ". the results of the combined slope and smoothness priors are below .     and @xmath58 gaussian wells with parameters : @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively.,height=188 ]    as we can see",
    ", a substantial improvement has been made over the attempt in section ( 3.1 ) .",
    "we now consistently obtain somewhat of a bowl shape . in comparing the solution we wish to achieve and the reconstruction we have ,",
    "one notices that the major problem areas are the outer regions , where the conductivity is nearly constant .",
    "as previously stated , equations ( [ eq : px ] ) and ( [ eq : py ] ) break down when the slopes are vanishing , so it is reasonable to assume that with this alone , the reconstruction will not improve as substantially as we need it to . as before ,",
    "we implement another prior to aid us .",
    "to help reconstruct the outermost regions of the well , we need a prior that will go to @xmath54 for regions that have vanishing slope .",
    "the most obvious choice is therefore to use what we computed for the smoothness prior    @xmath32    and set    @xmath61    using    @xmath62    in the mhmcmc algorithm .",
    "again , the worry that adding a new prior would undermine the generality of the algorithm can be eased by noting that we are simply accounting for a problematic case not treated by the slope prior , though we still test this prior on the tilted plane .",
    "the @xmath58 tilted plane is given by    @xmath63    running the mhmcmc algorithm with all three priors yields fairly accurate reconstructions , that miss the solution by @xmath64 .",
    "one should again note the presence of the familiar ( though no less troublesome ) boundary points .",
    "tilted plane , and a reconstruction using all three priors.,height=188 ]    we now try once again to reconstruct the gaussian well .",
    "the results of the added prior are apparent , and regions with vanishing slope are treated much more accurately than before .",
    "perhaps the most successful reconstruction thus far is the following ( though many more possible combinations of @xmath44 , @xmath65 and w must be explored ) .     gaussian well using all three priors , at @xmath45 and @xmath66 million interations.,height=188 ]    an obvious flaw in these reconstructions happens to be the width of the well , the algorithm is still capable of reconstructing the center of the well , and its depth , but it is often much narrower than in the actual solution .",
    "it would seem the algorithm has trouble starting to drop off from the vanishing slope region into the varying one .",
    "this exposes an inherent problem with the patchwork we have taken thus far : getting the seams to match up nicely .",
    "as we have seen , reconstructions of the heat conductivity greatly benefit from added priors .",
    "there is certainly much work left to be done , and a very careful analysis of the seams at which the various priors trade off is in order .",
    "however , we believe that in testing the algorithm against other complex nonconstant conductivities , which is the next step we plan to take , it is possible to complete the aforementioned analysis of the seams and reconstruct complex quantities via this patchwork method .",
    "i was introduced to this problem at a national science foundation reu program at george mason university , and would like to thank both of those institutions for the oppurtunity that gave me .",
    "i would also like to thank professors timothy sauer and harbir lamba at gmu , who got me started on this project while i was there and helped me decipher the mhmcmc algorithm ."
