    "starting from exosat and ginga observations , it has become progressively clear that the x  ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies are rather complex ( see , e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 , and ref . therein ) , with the effects of radiative transfer in the environment of the central engine complicating the view of the primary emission .",
    "the latter is empirically described as a power law , which , according to osse / cgro observations ( gondek et al .",
    "1996 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ) , appears to break at high energies in a manner that can be described to a first approximation by an exponential cutoff , although the value of the @xmath1-folding energy in individual objects remains to be properly constrained . at energies below about 12 kev",
    "the incidence of a further continuum component in excess to the power law , the so  called soft x ",
    "ray excess , is not yet completely well assessed , with asca data showing it to be rather less common ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) than in rosat data ( e.g. walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "in fact this issue had a significant turn after the discovery with rosat and , more accurately , with asca of the rather common incidence of a warm absorber : in essence , both types of features are determined with less ambiguity the better the slope of the power law is constrained , a task which asca , in addition to the higher energy resolution , could achieve more directly than rosat because of its energy coverage up to 10 kev . to complicate the matter there is another , seemingly ubiquitous , continuum component , which affects the power law slope determination in the asca band ( as it previously did in the heao1 and exosat bands ) and peaks beyond that band , around 30 kev .",
    "this component , discovered with ginga , is interpreted as compton reflection of the power law photons off thick matter that can be the accretion disk itself and/or the torus envisaged in the unified seyfert 1 and 2 scenario .",
    "this component is typically accompanied by the iron k fluorescence line , discovered in fact before the reflection .",
    "the accuracy achieved on the strength of the reflection is then relevant to the determination of the power law slope and , consequently , of the soft excess and/or the warm absorber parameters .",
    "observationally the situation is further complicated by the well known variability of these objects , such that combining data from satellites covering different energy ranges and collected at different times leads to further ambiguities .    the narrow field instruments aboard bepposax offer for the first time the opportunity to cover simultaneously , and with a reasonably good spectral resolution , the band from 0.1 to 200 kev , hence to determine the various spectral parameters , especially the broad ones , with better confidence than could be done before .",
    "this paper reports results obtained as part of a broad band spectral survey of seyfert 1s , with 210 kev fluxes greater than about 12 mcrab . after the observation of ngc 4593 described in guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1999a ) here we present the observation of the brightest source in the sample , ic 4329a . in sect .",
    "2 the earlier x  ray studies are summarized . in sects . 3 and 4 , the data reduction and the spectral analysis are respectively presented . in sect .",
    "5 these results are commented on and compared with previous ones , and the conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "ic 4329a is classified as a seyfert 1.0 galaxy ( whittle 1992 ) at z=0.016 ( wilson & penston 1979 ) .",
    "the 210 kev flux records in the literature show a relatively modest variability on timescales of hours  days , and fall within 50% of 1.0@xmath210@xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( corrected for absorption ) , corresponding to l(210 kev ) = 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath5 ( @xmath7=50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , from inspection of the 210 kev light curve from the asm instrument onboard rossi xte ( quick look results provided by the asm / rxte team ) it appears that this object undergoes occasional outbursts by up to a factor of about 10 , with timescales of the order of a few days .",
    "furthermore a factor 3 decline in about four days in visible in the light curve from the january 1993 osse / cgro observation , albeit in the quite different band from 50 to 150 kev ( fabian et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the spectrum displays neutral absorption at low energies , due to a gas column about ten times greater than the galactic value n@xmath8=4.5@xmath210@xmath9 @xmath4 ( elvis et al . 1989 ) , conceivably associated with the disk of the host galaxy , which is oriented nearly edge  on ( petre et al .",

    "( 1992 ) presents tentative evidence of a time lag by more than three days in the response of the reflection component to an increase of the power law by 20% in three days .",
    "contemporaneous observations with rosat and osse / cgro in january 1993 ( madejski et al .",
    "1995 ) gave for the reflection component results , with large errors , consistent with those obtained by ginga , providing in addition a lower limit of about 100 kev for the @xmath1folding energy of the power law .",

    "1997 , reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "the detailed analysis by cappi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , for what concerns the reflection , provides results surprisingly at variance with those obtained with ginga : despite the flux level being only 30% lower , the best fit relative normalization of the reflection component is about three times stronger , while the gaussian fit of the iron line yields about the same ew ( 89@xmath1234 ev at 90% confidence for one interesting parameter , i. p. ) .",
    "this result is hard to reconcile with the idea that both the line and the reflection arise from the same matter , and we shall return to it in sect . 5 .    at low energies",

    "\\c ) the state of the warm absorber in this observation appears different from that found in the asca observation , in particular the absence of a significant absorption at the o  viii k edge implies a lower ionization parameter , which contrasts the fact that the intensity of the ionizing continuum , as inferred from the direct primary emission , is actually 30% higher .",
    "we tentatively argue that at the epoch of the asca observation the ionization state might have been higher than in equilibrium , due to a transition of the continuum from a high to a low state immediately prior to that epoch .",
    "comfortably this same argument offers an explanation for the strength of the reflection component at the same epoch , which , albeit ill constrained , seems to have been irreducibly higher than found at the epoch of our observation .",
