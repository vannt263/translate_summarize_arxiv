    "+ the derivation of asymptotic distributional results for such types of geometric objects often poses interesting technical challenges . in the case of density ridges in @xmath4 , qiao and polonik ( 2015a )",
    "were able to derive such a distributional result for a smoothing based plug - in estimator .",
    "note that density ridges in @xmath4 can be considered as curves indexed by a parameter , and the distributional result in qiao and polonik ( 2015a ) is _ uniform _ over the parameter . because of the pointwise asymptotic normality of the estimator and the uniform nature of the result , the extreme value behavior of a gaussian process on growing ( rescaled ) manifold comes into play there .",
    "the corresponding result needed in qiao and polonik ( 2015a ) is proved here .",
    "in fact we derive a much more general result , allowing for arbitrary dimension and more general non - stationarity .",
    "+ also in other statistical literature the construction of uniform confidence bands for a target quantity rely on the asymptotic excursion probability of gaussian processes or fields on growing sets .",

    "there , however , the processes in question are more complex .",
