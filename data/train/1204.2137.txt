    "the field of quantum information processing is attracting considerable interest , and scientists in a variety of disciplines have devoted intense effort to the realization of quantum information principles , technologies , and algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the most advanced experimental demonstrations of controllable quantum coherent systems include trapped ions and atoms  @xcite , spins  @xcite , and superconducting circuits  @xcite .    the properties of atoms have been studied extensively over the past century .",
    "atoms have stable energy levels that can be used to represent the different states of qubits .",
    "in addition , the coherence times of isolated atoms are long because of their weak interaction with the surrounding environment  @xcite .",
    "spins are another promising candidate for future quantum technologies  @xcite .",
    "impurity spins can behave as qubits and can be used to store or process quantum information .",
    "for example , phosphorous impurities in silicon  @xcite and nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color centers in diamond  @xcite possess good coherence properties , which allow long storage times .",
    "furthermore , rapid progress has been made with quantum dots  @xcite , which can be fabricated on a chip and controlled relatively easily using electric signals .",
    "remarkable progress has also been made on other systems , such as superconducting ( sc ) circuits .",
    "these sc circuits promise good scalability  @xcite and allow robust control , storage and readout due to their strong interaction with external fields .",
    "table  [ table1 ] compares different systems used as qubits .",
    "each system has its own advantages and disadvantages [ see , e.g. , @xcite , for a recent overview ] .",
    "macroscopic systems , such as sc qubits , offer flexibility , tunability , scalability , and strong coupling to external fields , but have relatively short coherence times ( @xmath0 ms ) and in general are not identically reproducible . on the other hand , microscopic systems , such as atoms and spins , are given by nature and can easily be made as identical qubits with long coherence times ( @xmath1 ms ) , but they operate slowly because of their weak coupling to external fields , and have limited scalability ( i.e. , it is difficult to individually control many atoms working as qubits ) .",
    "a promising idea pursued by various groups at the moment is to combine these different systems and build new hybrid quantum structures that would inherit only the advantages of each one of the different components  @xcite .",
    "the most actively pursued type of hybrid quantum circuits ( hqcs ) uses sc qubits because of their strong coupling to external fields and ease of control .",
    "indeed , rapid progress has been achieved with sc circuits , and many groups are devoting efforts to find a good model to build a hybrid quantum circuit .",
    "the long - time storage of the quantum information can be implemented in microscopic systems , such as atoms or spins  @xcite .",
    "this situation is analogous to that in classical computers , which combine electronic circuits and magnetic drives to achieve fast processing and robust long - time information storage , respectively .",
    "hqcs involving sc circuits and nanomechanical resonators ( namrs ) are another emerging type of hybrid quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , many studies have been devoted to this new and exciting subject for its promising applications in future quantum devices  @xcite and the possibility of observing the quantum - to - classical transition in such a macroscopic object  @xcite . with current technology , namrs can be fabricated with sc circuits on a small chip , and have high quality factors and high vibrational mode frequencies  @xcite . through an effective coupling between the namr and the sc circuit ,",
    "the namr can be considered as a``cavity '' to study cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and also can be cooled down to explore the transition from classical to quantum mechanics .",
    "[ table1 ]    by far the most successful hybrid system involving sc qubits is the combination of a cavity and sc qubits . this hybrid system , often called circuit qed , has been reviewed and widely used in quantum technologies in the past  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on more complex hybrid systems involving `` sc qubits plus a cavity '' ( a hybrid system itself ) _ interacting with other quantum systems _ , including atoms ( both natural and artificial ) as well as ions and various other quantum systems .",
    "namely , the hybrid circuits we will be focusing on here are composed of various types of quantum systems interacting with a ( hybrid ) circuit qed system .    in this review",
    ", we first overview different basic elements needed to build hqcs , and then we highlight the progress achieved so far integrating these systems .",
    "atomic systems ( including neutral atoms , polar molecules , and ions ) have been studied for a long time , and are promising systems for future quantum technologies .",
    "because of the weak interaction with the environment , atomic systems can achieve long coherence times , which is useful for storing quantum information .",
    "in general , optical pumping and cooling , electromagnetic radiation , and laser - induced fluorescence are utilized to initialize , manipulate , and measure the qubit encoded in the atomic levels  @xcite .",
    "recently , much progress was achieved studying atoms trapped in optical lattices ; see fig .",
    "[ atsp](a ) . in this",
    "ultra - low - temperature system , atoms are trapped in microscopic arrays created by laser beams , and can be precisely manipulated for eventual use in future quantum devices [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] and simulators [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] .        however , because atoms interact with each other weakly , achieving many - qubit entangled states or quantum gate operations becomes a major challenge . as a way to overcome this problem ,",
    "rydberg states of atoms  @xcite [ or polar molecules  @xcite ] with their large dipole - dipole interactions have been explored for the realization of quantum gate operations .",
    "rydberg states occur when an atom is excited such that one of the electrons moves into a high principal quantum number orbital .",
    "such rydberg atoms are much more sensitive to external fields and possess very large electric dipole moments . similar to the coulomb blockade and the photon blockade , the rydberg blockade , which prevents atoms from being excited to a rydberg state",
    "if there is another rydberg atom nearby , can be used to entangle two atoms located in two separate optical dipole traps and implement effective two - qubit gate operations  @xcite .",
    "ions are another prospective type of qubits with long coherence times  @xcite",
    ". because they are charged , interactions among ions via coulomb repulsion are much stronger than those among atoms .",
    "this property facilitates the realization of two- or multiqubit operations .",
    "ions can also be cooled by laser beams and trapped by electrical or magnetic fields , and they can be manipulated with high precision , see fig .  [",
    "atsp](b ) .",
    "generally , hyperfine or zeeman sublevels , the ground and excited states of an optical transition , and the collective motion of ions can be used to encode quantum information with long lifetimes @xmath2  s , @xmath3  s , and @xmath4  ms , respectively .",
    "the single - qubit gate time of trapped ions is around 50 ps , while the two - qubit gate time is around hundreds of microseconds  @xcite .",
    "the manipulation of ions can be achieved using the same methods used for atoms .    in atomic systems ,",
    "the coherence times are very long .",
    "however , compared to other systems , initialization , operation and measurement times are also very long .",
    "thus , combining an atomic system ( with long coherence times ) with another system that allows fast operations has emerged as a possible way to construct novel devices benefiting from the advantages of two seemingly different systems .",
    "spins can also serve as qubits and store or process quantum information  @xcite .",
    "in general , two kinds of spins are used in quantum computation : electron spin and nuclear spin .",
    "both types can interact with the electric or magnetic fields of a photon .",
    "one can trap atomic gases and utilize electron spins to store quantum information .",
    "however , the techniques of trapping and cooling are rather complicated .",
    "alternatively , by integrating dopants into a solid - state host material , large arrays of spin qubits can more easily be assembled in experiment .",
    "spins in solids generally fall into two classes : quantum dots and atomic impurities .",
    "quantum dots are small nanostructures where electrons are trapped in a potential well and have discrete energy levels  @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ atsp](c ) .",
    "these come in several forms .",
    "one is electrostatically defined quantum dots , where the distribution of electrons is controlled by voltages on lithographically fabricated metallic gates .",
    "another form is self - assembled quantum dots , where electrons are confined by the artificial potential produced by a semiconductor growth process . in both types of quantum dots , by employing electrical or optical control , the manipulation , storage and readout of the qubit have been demonstrated in experiment , with typical gate times @xmath5 ps  @xcite . as reported by @xcite ,",
    "the coupling strength between the electric field and a single electron spin in a quantum dot can reach @xmath6 mhz , which is much larger than the coupling strength ( @xmath7 hz ) between the external magnetic field and the electron spin in an impurity  @xcite . however , the interaction between the spin and its surrounding spin bath ( mainly nuclear spins ) has so far limited coherence times to hundreds of microseconds or less  @xcite .    atomic impurities , such as phosphorus in silicon  @xcite , er@xmath8 ions in @xmath9 crystal  @xcite , and nv color centers in diamond  @xcite , can be conveniently integrated in solid - state devices and can have nuclear spins , electron spins , or both .",
    "phosphorus impurities in silicon involve both electron and nuclear spins , and they possess excellent coherence properties [ both have spin coherence times @xmath10 s  @xcite ] .",
    "gate times are on the order of 1 ns . using microwave and radio - frequency pulses",
    ", spins can implement quantum information processing , especially storage , in a conventional semiconductor material .",
    "also , these spins can be controlled by strain  @xcite or via the stark shift  @xcite .",
    "electron spins of er@xmath8 ions doped in a crystal also have long coherence times ( @xmath3 ms ) .",
    "either optical or microwave photon states can be mapped into spin states of er@xmath8 ions by different energy - level transitions  @xcite .",
    "thus , er@xmath8 ions are a good candidate for use as a quantum interface between microwave and optical photons .",
    "an nv center in diamond consists of a substitutional nitrogen ( n ) atom replacing a carbon atom and neighboring one vacancy ( v ) .",
    "in such centers , both electron and nuclear spins can be used in quantum technologies and also exhibit long coherence times ( @xmath11 ms for the electron spin and @xmath3 s for the nuclear spin ; the single - qubit gate time is @xmath12 ns for electron spins and @xmath13s for nuclear spins ) in a wide temperature range , even at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "importantly , these nv centers can be used to detect weak magnetic fields  @xcite and electric fields  @xcite at room temperature , instead of using low - temperature sensors .",
    "the electronic ground state of the nv center is a spin-1 triplet , @xmath14 with @xmath15 . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath16 sublevel is two - fold degenerate and the resonance transition frequency between the @xmath17 and @xmath16 sublevels is 2.87 ghz , which nicely matches the microwave frequency regime of sc qubits .",
    "this zero - field splitting in the nv center is caused by the reduction of the spin s rotation symmetry in the crystal . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath16 sublevel is split into two levels , which makes it possible to address these two levels individually .",
    "nv centers also possess transitions from the electronic ground state to an excited electronic state , and the corresponding transition frequency is in the optical regime .",
    "these transitions can be used for the initialization and readout of the quantum state .",
    "therefore , by using both laser and microwave fields , one can implement the manipulation , storage , and readout of the quantum information encoded in the different sublevels  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , coherence times can be enhanced if one applies appropriate sequences of laser pulses and microwave fields  @xcite , or transfers the quantum information from the electron spins to nearby nuclear spins by using the hyperfine interaction  @xcite .",
    "such interactions also allow the implementation of few - qubit quantum registers  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because nv centers couple to both optical and microwave fields , they can also be used as a quantum interface between optical and solid - state systems .",
    "this provides a promising platform to study novel quantum phenomena based on nv centers separated by long distances .",
    "for instance , quantum interference of two polarized optical photons produced by nv centers in two separate diamond samples  @xcite [ or two separate nv centers in the same diamond sample  @xcite ] and quantum entanglement between a polarized optical photon and a nv center qubit  @xcite have recently been realized in experiment .",
    "group - v endohedral fullerenes , consisting of a group - v atom ( e.g. , nitrogen ) trapped inside a fullerene cage , are another spin system  @xcite that might be integrated in solid - state systems .",
    "group - v endohedral fullerenes exhibit extraordinarily long spin relaxation times  @xcite ( @xmath11 s at 4 k ) due to the existence of the fullerene cage , which protects the enclosed spin from fluctuating perturbations in various host environments .",
    "the molecule n@c@xmath18 , which has electron spin @xmath19 coupled to the @xmath20n nuclear spin @xmath21 via an isotropic hyperfine interaction , is a major member of the group - v endohedral fullerenes . by utilizing the technology of electron - spin resonance ( or nuclear magnetic resonance ) , quantum operations and readout of the qubits encoded in the electron ( or nuclear ) spins of the nitrogen atoms of the molecule",
    "n@c@xmath18 could be achieved .",
    "spin systems have similar or even longer coherence times than atomic systems .",
    "however , weak coupling to external fields leads to difficulties in the implementation of quantum gate operations .",
    "solid - state systems , such as sc circuits , are an attractive platform for that purpose , as discussed in the next section .",
    "sc qubit circuits based on josephson junctions are macroscopic circuits , and they operate at temperatures of tens of mk . although not microscopic in size , they can still behave quantum mechanically , allowing the observation of quantum coherence on a macroscopic scale .",
    "compared to normal harmonic oscillators formed by _",
    "lc _ circuits , in sc qubits the energy - level separation becomes nonuniform by introducing a nonlinearity via josephson junctions .",
    "this property allows one to encode a qubit in the lowest two levels of a sc circuit for implementing quantum computing and simulation  @xcite .",
    "these circuits have two important parameters : the josephson coupling energy @xmath22 and the electrostatic coulomb energy @xmath23 . according to their topology and physical parameters ,",
    "sc qubits can be divided into three kinds : charge qubits ( using cooper - pairs on a small island and @xmath24 ) , flux qubits ( using the circulating supercurrent states in a loop and @xmath25 ) , and phase qubits ( using the oscillatory states of the circuit and @xmath25 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "these solid - state qubits can be controlled by the applied bias current , gate voltage , and microwave fields .",
    "all of these have been demonstrated in various experiments  @xcite .",
    "single - qubit and two - qubit gate times are @xmath11 and @xmath26 1050 ns , respectively , while coherence times are currently @xmath27s and are growing steadily . demonstrating the potential scalability of sc qubits ,",
    "one experiment has integrated 512 qubits fabricated on a single chip  @xcite .",
    "thus , sc qubits are promising candidates for future quantum applications on a chip .",
    "superconducting qubits are sensitive to environmental noise from extrinsic and intrinsic decohering elements , which leads to short coherence times .",
    "decoherence caused by extrinsic elements , such as the local electromagnetic environment , could be reduced using better design of the qubits and the surrounding circuitry , but the main intrinsic element that limits the coherence results from the hard - to - avoid low - frequency noise . for charge qubits ,",
    "the dominant source of noise is charge fluctuators , such as trapped charges in the substrate and oxide layers of josephson junctions . for flux and phase qubits ,",
    "the noise from flux fluctuations dominates the decoherence .",
    "the development of more advanced sc qubit designs  @xcite recently ameliorated this problem .",
    "for example , in three - junction flux qubits  @xcite , the effect of flux noise on the qubit can be reduced by decreasing @xmath22 , but the charge noise can become increasingly important when decreasing @xmath22 .",
    "the proposal by @xcite and @xcite improved the three - junction flux - qubit design by reducing the effective @xmath22 and adding a large shunt capacitor to the small junction , so as to reduce the effects of both charge and flux noise ; see fig .",
    "indeed , a recent experiment  @xcite demonstrated that this proposal is very effective in ameliorating the effect of low - frequency noise . a complementary proposal for a modified type of charge qubit , named transmon ,",
    "was put forward by @xcite ; see fig .  [ scq ] .",
    "the transmon qubit greatly reduces the charge dispersion , while the anharmonicity ( which is necessary in order to prevent the qubit from turning into a harmonic oscillator ) decreases by a much smaller amount .",
    "because the qubit becomes less sensitive to charge variations , the need for electrostatic gates and tuning to a charge sweet spot becomes less necessary .",
    "in addition , the qubit in @xcite is another improved sc qubit which was named fluxonium . in the fluxonium",
    ", a small junction is shunted by a series array of large - area tunnel junctions ; see fig .  [ scq ] . by carefully choosing the parameters of the tunnel junctions , it is possible to protect the fluxonium from both charge and flux noise .",
    "sc qubits can couple strongly to each other or to cavities via electromagnetic fields , which makes fast gate operations possible with current technology .",
    "however , strong coupling also leads to high sensitivity to noise and therefore short coherence times ( several microseconds ) compared to isolated atoms or spins .",
    "thus , improving the coherence properties is a paramount priority for sc qubits .",
    "recently , through dynamical decoupling with a flux qubit  @xcite or embedding the transmon qubit in a 3d circuit qed with a high @xmath28 factor  @xcite , coherence times of sc qubits have been enhanced to around 10 @xmath29s .",
    "a cavity is one of the two basic elements of cavity qed  @xcite .",
    "the quantized electromagnetic field in the cavity can interact with an atom ( or spin or sc qubit ) , and exchange energy with it .",
    "thus , a cavity can serve as a data bus in quantum information processing and transfer quantum data between different qubits .",
    "however , any real cavity system suffers from energy losses , which can be described by the quality factor @xmath28 .",
    "a higher @xmath28 factor indicates a lower rate of energy loss in the cavity .",
    "in general , atoms and spins couple to conventional cavity systems , while sc qubits easily couple to sc resonators , such as sc coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) resonators and _ lc _ resonators , playing the role of cavities .",
    "many types of cavity systems can be used to couple qubits to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the optical cavity consisting of two separated parallel mirrors is the most conventional cavity system , called the fabry - perot cavity , see fig .",
    "[ cav](a ) .",
    "in such a cavity , a standing - wave electromagnetic field can exist for a long time and interact with an atom ( or spin ) trapped in the cavity . with an appropriate design ,",
    "a fabry - perot cavity can achieve high quality factors @xmath30  @xcite , which provides a good platform for the realization of cavity qed .",
    "in other optical cavity systems , such as the microsphere cavity ( dielectric spherically symmetric structure )  @xcite , the microtoroidal cavity ( dielectric rotationally symmetric structure )  @xcite , and the photonic band - gap cavity ( periodic optical nanostructure that governs the motion of photons )  @xcite , very high quality factors have also been achieved .",
    "the dynamics of a cavity can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the frequency of the @xmath33th cavity mode , and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the associated creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "besides the above mentioned cavities , some other resonators , such as cpw and _ lc _ resonators , can also serve as cavities in sc circuits with low losses . these resonators can be described by the same hamiltonian as that given in eq .",
    "( [ care ] ) .",
    "cpw resonators [ see fig .  [ cav](b ) ] have been realized in several experiments  @xcite . in these sc resonators ,",
    "two ground planes are placed on the two sides of a central sc wire ; this defines the cpw resonator ( or transmission line resonator ) .",
    "two gap capacitors play the role of the mirrors in a conventional optical cavity , and the distance between these capacitors defines the characteristic frequencies of the normal modes .",
    "furthermore , the frequencies of the resonator can be adjusted by including a superconducting interference device ( squid ) array in the sc wire  @xcite .",
    "in general , the entire setup should be on the millimeter scale in order to fit the microwave frequency of the sc qubit , and it can be built by etching techniques .",
    "recent experiments showed that gigahertz photons can make up to a million bounces before being lost in a high quality cpw resonator at low temperatures .",
    "an _ lc _ resonator consists of an inductor and a capacitor with resonance frequency @xmath36 . with appropriate design , the _ lc _ resonator can be integrated into a sc circuit and effectively serve as a cavity .",
    "different from a cpw resonator , the _ lc _ resonator has only a single cavity mode .",
    "one recent proposal for creating tunable cavities in sc circuits involves using a one - dimensional array of sc resonators as a medium and two sc qubits as tunable mirrors  @xcite .",
    "the resonator array supports allowed energy bands for photon propagation , just as in a photonic crystal .",
    "when the frequency of a qubit that is coupled to one of the resonators is tuned to match the photon frequency , it can act like a perfectly reflecting mirror .",
    "thus , by appropriately biasing two qubits coupled to two resonators in the array , one obtains an analog of a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "namrs have recently attracted considerable attention for their possible applications in future quantum technologies . with current experimental techniques , namrs can be built with quality factors @xmath28 in the range of @xmath37 to @xmath38 , and fundamental vibrational mode frequencies in the range from 10 mhz to 1 ghz , at low temperatures @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "if the vibrational energy of the namr becomes larger than the thermal energy @xmath40 , then the mechanical oscillation can behave quantum mechanically .",
    "however , the observation of quantum behavior is challenging since it requires cooling the mechanical motion to extremely low temperatures and the ability to generate nonclassical states .",
    "currently , many groups are devoting tremendous efforts to devising hybrid systems to create a coherent interface between namrs and other well - controlled quantum systems .",
    "some focus on optomechanical systems involving an oscillating cantilever or an oscillating micromirror as a harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "others focus on how to integrate namrs into sc circuits and couple them to each other  @xcite .",
    "cavity qed studies the interaction between matter and the field in a cavity . in the simplest case ,",
    "a two - level system ( tls ) and a quantized electromagnetic field can coherently exchange a quantum of energy ( a single photon ) back and forth in the cavity at the rabi frequency , which is proportional to the system - field coupling strength .",
    "this energy exchange process is called rabi oscillations  @xcite . unfortunately , in any real system , other undesirable losses , such as decay from the cavity ( at rate @xmath41 ) and from the atom ( at rate @xmath42 ) , can take place .",
    "the coherent exchange of energy between the tls and the cavity can be observed only when the rabi frequency is much larger than the loss rates ( @xmath43 ) , which is known as the strong - coupling regime .",
    "cavity qed can be realized in various systems , such as atom - cavity devices and spin - cavity systems , which have been studied for many years .",
    "cavity qed with sc qubits has also been experimentally demonstrated . table  ii list data for different cavities and resonators .",
    "[ table2 ]    in general , the dynamics of a cavity - qed system consisting of a cavity mode and a tls can be described by the universal hamiltonian : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the hamiltonian of the tls @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy gap between the ground and excited states of the tls , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) denotes the tls raising ( lowering ) operator .",
    "@xmath50 is the hamiltonian of the cavity mode @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of cavity photons with frequency @xmath54 .",
    "lastly , @xmath55 describes the interation between the tls and the cavity mode : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the coupling strength between the tls and the cavity .    in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath58 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the detuning between the cavity mode and the tls , and @xmath61 .",
    "depending on the relation between the system parameters , three different regimes are identified : the weak - coupling regime where @xmath62 , the strong - coupling regime where @xmath63 , and the ultrastrong - coupling regime where @xmath64 . in the weak- and strong - coupling regimes ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath57 is much smaller than the frequencies of the two subsystems . at the same time , the so - called counter - rotating terms , i.e. those proportional to @xmath65 , oscillate rapidly and their average over a time scale larger than @xmath66 becomes zero .",
    "thus , these terms lead to small and fast oscillations added to the otherwise smooth dynamics of the system , and they can be neglected in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "the reduced interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath67 or @xmath68 which is known as the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model . in the ultrastrong - coupling regime , where the coupling strength @xmath57 is comparable with the energies of the tls and the cavity mode , the counter - rotating terms also play an important role in determining the system properties and dynamics , and they can not be neglected  @xcite . the ultrastrong - coupling regime is an active research area .      in atom - cavity systems",
    "there are many significant physical phenomena that have been experimentally demonstrated in the strong - coupling regime , such as rabi oscillations  @xcite , which involve the exchange of photons between the atom and the cavity .",
    "the atom - cavity system can also be arranged as a waveguide to transfer or store quantum data  @xcite . because the coupling between the atom and the cavity mode is intrinsically proportional to a small constant @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fine structure constant  @xcite , it is difficult to significantly increase the atom - cavity coupling strength .    in past years",
    ", rapid progress has been made in this field .",
    "recent experimental demonstrations of strong coupling have been achieved in several kinds of cavities , such as fp cavities  @xcite , microsphere cavities  @xcite , photonic band - gap cavities  @xcite , and microtoroidal cavities  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a toroidal cavity , the coupling between the atom and the cavity can exceed 700 mhz , and the relevant coupling - to - dissipation ratio can reach 40 , which lies in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "spins can also be placed in cavities and interact with cavity photons .",
    "such a spin - cavity system , whose dynamics can usually be described by the same simple hamiltonian ( [ jc ] ) ( where the index `` tls '' is replaced by `` spin '' ) , can therefore be employed to realize cavity qed .",
    "furthermore , most spin systems , such as electron spins in quantum dots that are embedded in a solid - state chip and controlled by voltages , exhibit good scalability and tunability , which are vital elements for experimentally observing cavity - qed phenomena and designing quantum devices .    in the past few years , spin - cavity systems have been theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated .",
    "quantum dots can be integrated into micropillar cavities  @xcite , microdisk cavities  @xcite , or photonic crystal cavities  @xcite , and strong coupling with the photon field in the cavity can be achieved .",
    "atomic impurity spins , especially nv centers , can also couple to microsphere cavities  @xcite , microtoroidal cavities  @xcite , or photonic crystal cavities  @xcite .          recently , a growing new subfield in sc qubit research is finding physical phenomena in sc circuits analogous to the ones in atomic physics and quantum optics .",
    "a high quality microwave resonator can be coupled to sc qubits , which can be used to realize cavity - qed where the sc qubit is regarded as an artificial atom  @xcite .",
    "the resonator can be either a cpw resonator or an _ lc _ resonator .",
    "the dynamics of such sc circuits can be described by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ njc ] ) , where the index tls is replaced by sc denoting the sc qubit . in this hamiltonian ,",
    "the decay from the resonator and spontaneous emission are neglected .",
    "the coupling strength between matter and the cavity mode is determined by both the transition dipole moment and the vacuum field strength .",
    "a sc qubit can have a large effective transition dipole moment , e.g. , the effective electric dipole moment of a charge qubit is @xmath71 times larger than that of an alkali atom  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a quasi-1d cavity , such as a cpw resonator , the microwave field is confined to a much smaller volume than in a conventional 3d optical or microwave cavity .",
    "this can make the field strength in the quasi-1d cavity much larger ( about 100 times or more ) than in a 3d cavity .",
    "owing to the large dipole moment of a sc qubit and the strong electromagnetic field in a quasi-1d cavity , the sc qubit can couple to the quasi-1d cavity mode much more strongly than an atom or a spin couples to a 3d cavity .",
    "therefore , it becomes easier to reach the strong , or even ultrastrong , coupling regime using a sc circuit consisting of a sc qubit and a quasi-1d cavity .",
    "indeed , the strong  @xcite and ultrastrong  @xcite coupling regimes have been experimentally realized in this sc - cavity system . in the usual strong - coupling regime , the counter - rotating terms ( i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) can be neglected and the rwa is valid . however , in the ultrastrong - coupling regime  @xcite , the counter - rotating terms also play an important role and can not be neglected .",
    "note that either an atom or a spin can also be placed in a quasi-1d cavity ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : hcqed ] ) , but its coupling to the quasi-1d cavity mode is still much smaller than that of a sc qubit because the sc qubit has a much larger transition dipole moment .    for charge qubits ,",
    "electric fields are well suited for coupling to the qubits  @xcite .",
    "note that charge qubits can also be designed with a loop , such that they can also interact with magnetic fields  @xcite . a sc circuit involving a cpw resonator and a charge qubit",
    "was theoretically proposed by @xcite and experimentally demonstrated by @xcite , where a strong electric coupling between a single photon and a charge qubit was achieved . in this setup ,",

    "this nonlinear tunnel junction can convert the optical power to a current source as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the output dc current , @xmath225 is the efficiency coefficient , and @xmath226 the electric field at the tunnel junction , which has a frequency @xmath227 . in the downconversion process , there are two optical fields introduced at the junction .",
    "one is the signal photon from the optical subsystem with frequency @xmath228 , and the other is the strong laser beam with frequency @xmath227 .",
    "the output current produced by the nonlinear junction is @xmath229 , where @xmath230 can be in the ghz range , matching the working frequency of a sc subsystem . as a result ,",
    "quantum information carried in the optical photon can be converted to a current signal with ghz frequency and then transferred as a microwave photon in the microwave transmission medium . in the opposite process , the output current produced by the nonlinear junction becomes @xmath231 , and the microwave photon can then be up - converted to the optical photon . for other related work , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "hybrid quantum circuits promise to open up new possibilities for quantum technologies where the hybrid circuit combines the best features of its constituents , such as long coherence times , fast operations and scalability .",
    "we presented an overview of the current status of hqcs , especially devices integrating atomic or spin systems with sc qubits or resonators , where considerable progress has been made recently in both theory and experiment .",
    "even though the basic ideas for coupling the different systems together ( e.g. , relying on the natural coupling to electric or magnetic fields ) are quite simple , there are a variety of different approaches for putting a hybrid circuit together .",
    "for example , one can decide to use direct coupling between atomic and solid - state qubits or use a sc resonator to mediate the coupling by balancing the requirements of setup simplicity and sufficient coupling strength .",
    "moreover , there are many elements that can be used as the atomic or spin part of the hybrid device , and careful consideration of the properties of the different candidates must be considered before deciding which one is best - suited for achieving the desired purpose of the device .    experiments on hqcs are just starting to demonstrate the coherent coupling between different physical systems",
    ". however , with rapid progress in fabrication techniques , one can expect better results in the coming few years .",
    "in particular , the coupling of nv centers in diamond to sc qubits and resonators promises to be an active area of research for years to come , and one can envision such a hqcs to be a central component of quantum technologies ranging from precision - measurement devices to quantum computers .",
    "hybrid devices involving namrs are also starting to enter the quantum regime . with a constantly increasing level of control ,",
    "a number of experiments have demonstrated quantum effects in such hqcs in the past few years , and these circuits are now becoming increasingly feasible as components in technologies that involve mechanical sensing devices",
    ".    the field of hybrid circuits is still evolving , with new ideas emerging steadily .",
    "it is quite likely that in a few years the designs will be significantly more sophisticated than the prototypes that have been studied in recent years .",
