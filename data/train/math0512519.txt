    "in this paper , we consider compact isospectral riemannian 2-manifolds without boundary and we reserve the term riemann surfaces for ones with constant curvature -1 .",
    "many authors , including brooks - tse @xcite , buser @xcite and vignras @xcite have constructed pairs of isospectral non - isometric riemann surfaces of genus @xmath0 4 as well as surfaces of genus 3 with variable negative curvature .",
    "such constructions have developed rapidly since sunada s theorem @xcite was proved realising that certain group theoretic properties provide isospectrality of manifolds .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is the following .",
    "[ thmg2 ] there exists a pair of isospectral non - isometric surfaces of genus 2 with variable negative curvature .",
    "we also give new examples of such surfaces of genus 3 in the section [ genus3 ] .",
    "we refer @xcite for preliminary theorems and their proofs .",
    "first , sunada s theorem , the main tool of our construction , is discussed in the next section .",
    "sunada s original proof is based on properties of zeta functions in number field theory with the fact that the same zeta functions give the same eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "there is more than one version of the theorem and we approach it from the group theoretic point of view with the following definition concerning finite groups .    [ almost ] let t be a finite group , and let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be subgroups of t. then    1 .",

    "@xmath6 is called a sunada triple if in addition , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are non - conjugate in t.    the groups in a sunada triple are arranged to be covering transformation groups of normal coverings and they are related with heat kernels for the corresponding covering manifolds to induce the trace formula . since the heat trace determines the spectrum , manifolds with the same heat trace are isospectral .",
    "[ sunada ] let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be almost conjugate subgroups in a finite group t , and let @xmath7 be a surjective homomorphism where @xmath8 is a compact manifold .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the coverings of @xmath8 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then @xmath13 = @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 is isospectral to @xmath10 .",

    "even then , it is not sufficient enough to ensure a non - isometry between the covering manifolds @xmath18 and @xmath19 . one way of checking the existence of non - isometry between manifolds is by comparing the behaviour of geodesics on them and this is certainly the most common method used in riemann surfaces since huber s theorem states that compact riemann surfaces have the same eigenvalue spectrum if and only if they have the same geodesic length spectrum .    for a non - isometry , sunada imposed ` bumpy metrics ' , that is , nowhere locally homegeneous metrics , on @xmath8 .",
    "sunada @xcite showed that given any metric , there exists a nowhere locally homogeneous metric arbitrarily close in the @xmath20-topology to the given metric .    to complete sunada s construction ,",
    "we need a surjective homomorphism from @xmath21 onto @xmath22 , the group of isometries of the covering manifold @xmath23 in the diagram .",
    "this is an easy task for 2 dimensional manifolds but the case for dimension 3 requires more care . for dimension 4 and higher , one",
    "can easily obtain the required homomorphism by adding handles and apply sunada s theorem to have isospectral manifolds .",
    "note that sunada s theorem can be extended to orbifolds .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning , sunada s method was applied to construct isospectral riemann surfaces of genus 4 and above in @xcite and @xcite . in this section , we explain how we obtain the sunada triples with desired genera 2 and 3 .",
    "the difficulty of having such surfaces is that there are only finitely many possibilities for orders of generators of @xmath22 in definition [ almost ] .",
    "moreover , among the sunada triples satisfying these conditions , the requirement of the smoothness of @xmath24 , @xmath25 restricts the choices .",
    "consider the coverings of @xmath8 with covering transformation groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 as in the diagram above .",

    "the subgroups are required to avoid the conjugacy classes where the generators @xmath74 and @xmath75 and their powers belong to . there",
    "exist such subgroups and we choose @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be    @xmath76    clearly @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of index 12 . to construct desired surfaces",
    ", we use the geodeic polygon in figure [ 4gon ] as the fundamental domain whose vertices correspond to @xmath74 and @xmath77 . from the conjugacy classes of @xmath22 , one can check that they are almost conjugate but not conjugate .",
    "also no conjugates of @xmath74 and @xmath77 and their powers lie in @xmath1 and @xmath2 so that @xmath55 and @xmath78 are smooth surfaces .",
    "therefore @xmath6 is a sunada triple of index 12 . by lemma [ tr ] ( ii ) , @xmath79 and by sunada s theorem",
    ", they are isospctral riemann surfaces of genus 2 .",
    "now we investigate whether they are isometric .",
    "studying graphs , schreier graphs in particular , gives useful informations to determine whether surfaces arisen by sunada triple are isometric .",
    "if there is a reflection symmetry and an orientation reversing isometry in the fundamental domain , then the surfaces are isometric whenever the corresponding schreier graphs are isomorphic .",
    "if there is no such isometry , then geodesics are taken into consideration . for @xmath22 , the only possibility for",
    "the fundamental domain is the sphere with three singularities since it has essentially two generators @xmath74 .",

    "the vertices in figure [ graph3 ] are arranged so that one can see that two graphs are isomorphic with only arrows reversed .",
    "since figure [ 4gon ] has an orientation reversing isometry , the resulting riemann surfaces are isometric . to complete the proof of theorem [ thmg2 ] , we give a nowhere locally homogeneous metric on @xmath8 so that the isospectral surfaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - isometric with variable negative curvature .",

    "then @xmath83 is a sunada triple and we take a=(3 , 2 ) , b=(7 , 1 ) and c=(7 , 2 ) as the generators of @xmath84 .",
    "we use the sphere with four singularities corresponding to the vertex cycles @xmath85 and @xmath86 of order 2,2,2 and 4 respectively . by counting the number of intersections bewteen the conjugacy classes of powers of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , one can check that they are indeed a sunada triple .",

    "therefore @xmath24 , @xmath25 , are isospectral orbifolds genus 2 with two singularities of order two .",
    "brooks and tse @xcite constructed a pair of isospectral surfaces of genus 3 with bumpy metrics on them by considering @xmath91 .",
    "we present an example which gives this property with a different group , namely @xmath92 as listed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 and their product @xmath75 be    @xmath93    then @xmath65 and @xmath75 have order 4 , 4 and 6 , respectively and they generate @xmath92 .",
    "for this group , there is a gassmann pair @xmath94 of order 8 which do not meet the conjugacy classes where the powers of @xmath65 and @xmath75 belong to .",
    "@xmath95    let the coset representatives be @xmath96 of order 12 where    @xmath97    again we use the sphere with three singularities of order 4 , 4 and 6 and the symmetry of the fundamental domain forces the isometry between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "hence a bumpy metric on @xmath8 gives non - isometric isospectral surfaces of genus 3 with variable curvature .",
    "two smooth functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 on a smooth manifold @xmath23 are said to be isospectral potentials if the spectrum of @xmath102 is identical to that of @xmath103 .",

    "but it was pointed out by brooks @xcite that the simple length spectrum condition is never satisfied by a metric of constant negative curvature and hence the spectral rigidity of potential does not hold for riemann surfaces .",
    "he used this fact to give isospectral potentials on a surface of genus 3 and we construct ones for genus 2 .    let the sunada triple for genus 2 be @xmath6 in the section [ genus2 ] and let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be the normal coverings of @xmath8 .",
