    "we study in particular  with a cubic potential @xmath11",
    "the main feature of the normal matrix model is that the eigenvalues of @xmath5 fill out a bounded two - dimensional domain @xmath12 as @xmath13 with a uniform density .",

    "the laplacian growth is unstable and singularities such as boundary cusps may appear in finite time . see also @xcite for related work and surveys .",
    "however , from a mathematical point of view , the model  is not well - defined if @xmath9 is a polynomial of degree @xmath24 , since then the integral @xmath25 diverges , and one can not normalize the measure to make it a probability measure . to make the model well - defined ,",
    "elbau and felder @xcite propose to use a cut - off procedure . instead of considering all normal matrices @xmath5 ,",

    "our approach is to replace by a hermitian form defined on polynomials that is a priori not given by any integral , but that should satisfy the relevant algebraic properties of the scalar product . we define and classify these hermitian forms .",
    "see the next section for precise statements .",
    "it turns out that there is more than one possibility for such a hermitian form .",
    "we conjecture that for any polynomial @xmath9 it is possible to choose the hermitian form in such a way that that the corresponding orthogonal polynomials have the same asymptotic behavior as the orthogonal polynomials in the cut - off approach of elbau and felder .",
    "that is , for small values of @xmath35 the zeros of the polynomials accumulate on a tree like set @xmath39 with a limiting distribution @xmath40 satisfying .",

    "then three cusps are formed on the boundary and the laplacian growth breaks down .",
    "an asymptotic analysis at the critical time would involve the painlev i equation , which is what we see in our model and that we will address in a future paper .",
    "we note that ameur , hedenmalm and makarov @xcite do not use a cut - off .",

    "this means that the boundary integral in is exponentially small compared to the other terms in in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "inspired by our idea is to ignore the right - hand side of and require that the hermitian form satisfies the identity @xmath55 for all polynomials @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we call the structure relation . combining with we also have the dual structure relation",
    "@xmath56 we do not impose the condition that the hermitian form is positive definite , and therefore it may not be a scalar product .    our first result is a classification of hermitian forms satisfying and .",
    "sesquilinear forms that satisfy can be found as follows .",
