    "quantum amplification ( qa ) is at the heart of quantum measurement and quantum metrology . restricted by fundamental laws of physics , it is difficult for detectors to measure sufficiently weak signal , especially for quantum signal .",
    "amplifying signal first and then detect it with proper detector thus becomes a general way for signal detection .",
    "unfortunately , the intrinsic noise accompanying the signal is also amplified during the process of amplification and extra noises may be introduced to make the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) worse .    for a linear phase - preserving quantum amplifier , due to the constraint of bosonic commutation relation @xmath0=1 $ ]",
    ", it has been shown that there is at least @xmath1 total noise power per unit bandwidth out of its output - port , where @xmath2 is the power gain @xcite .",
    "as quantum signal amplification is equivalent to quantum state amplification , it seems that a universal linear phase - preserving quantum amplifier that can amplify any coherent state determinately and noiselessly is impossible @xcite .",
    "for the special set of coherent states , however , the probabilistic noiseless amplification of coherent states is physically realizable @xcite and there have been some experimental reports on the realization of noiseless amplification of quantum light states @xcite .",
    "moreover , regarding quantum state amplification as quantum state transformation , our recent research shows that for a certain set of coherent states , which satisfies particular conditions , there always exists a specific quantum amplifier that can amplify coherent state in that set determinately and noiselessly @xcite .",
    "although various investigations are given to quantum amplification , there is still lack of a general framework to discuss it . in this paper , a general framework of quantum state amplification using the language of quantum state transformation",
    "is given systematically for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the concept of amplification of quantum state is definitely defined .",
    "the general discussion of amplification of quantum states using the language of quantum state transformation is given and three different important amplifications , i.e. , deterministic noisy qa , probabilistic noiseless qa and deterministic noiseless qa are identified and discussed . in sec .",
    "iii , phase - preserving qa is considered and the particular interest is given to the deterministic noiseless gaussian state amplification .",
    "an example of application in phase measurement using deterministic noiseless qa is shown and the situation of amplified states in noisy environment is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , we give a summary of these results .",
    "before the detail discussion of quantum state amplification , an explicit definition of amplification of quantum state is necessary . the quantum state amplification defined as quantum state transformation",
    "is then illustrated and three different kinds of important qa are identified and discussed .",
    "suppose a system in which we have interest is in quantum state @xmath3 .",
    "when we measure the observable @xmath4 in this system , the physical quantity obtained in the measurement is the expectation of @xmath4 in state @xmath3 , that is @xmath5 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath6 of observable @xmath4 in state @xmath3 is usually called quantum signal .",
    "amplification of the quantum signal means the amplification of the expectation value @xmath6 , which is equivalent to the amplification of state @xmath3 .",
    "now suppose that the system evolves under an operation that transforms the state @xmath3 into the another state @xmath7 .",
    "if the expectation value of observable @xmath4 in the state @xmath7 is larger than the expectation value in state @xmath3 , that is @xmath8 , then we say the quantum signal is amplified , or equivalently , the state is amplified with respect to observable @xmath4 .",
    "the process of quantum signal amplification is thus actually a process of quantum state transformation .",
    "note that qa is related with the measurement of observable .",
    "we thus give the following definition of amplification of quantum state .    * definition 1 : * if there exists an operation that transforms the state @xmath3 of quantum system into the another state @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , then this process is called the amplification of the state @xmath3 with respect to observable @xmath4 . the state @xmath7 is called the amplified state of the state @xmath3 with respect to observable @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath9 with @xmath10 , we say that the state @xmath3 is amplified with gain of @xmath11 .",
    "if there exists a setup that can amplify state @xmath3 into the amplified state @xmath7 with the gain of @xmath11 , then we call that setup a quantum amplifier with gain of @xmath11 of the amplification .",
    "a quantum amplifier is thus a physical system whose function is to transform the input state @xmath3 to the amplified state @xmath7 .    before the amplification ,",
    "the fluctuation of observable @xmath4 in state @xmath3 is @xmath12 .",
    "after the amplification , the fluctuation of observable @xmath4 in the amplified state @xmath7 becomes @xmath13 .",
    "the amplification is called noiseless if @xmath14 , otherwise , the amplification is noisy . the definition of noiseless amplification of quantum state is thus defined as below .",
    "* definition 2 : * the quantum amplification is called noiseless if the fluctuation of observable @xmath4 is the same in the state @xmath3 and the amplified state @xmath7 , otherwise the quantum amplification is noisy .",
    "the above definition can be easily extended to mixed state of a quantum system .",
    "suppose that the state of the quantum system is @xmath15 , if we send this state to a quantum amplifier with gain of @xmath11 and the amplified state is @xmath16 , then we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the expectation values of observable @xmath4 in state @xmath16 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the amplification is noiseless if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fluctuations of observable @xmath4 in state @xmath16 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the definition of amplification of quantum state with respect to two observables or more than two observables is also valid .",
    "for example , in the case of two observables @xmath4 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gains of amplification with respect to observables @xmath4 and @xmath23 respectively . the gains of @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be equal to each other that @xmath28 or unequal to each other that @xmath29 .",
    "the amplification is noiseless if and only if @xmath14 and @xmath30 . if @xmath14 but @xmath31 , then the amplification is only noiseless with respect to observable @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath32 but @xmath30 , then the amplification is only noiseless with respect to observable @xmath23 . in all other cases ,",
    "the amplification is not noiseless .",
    "according to the definition of amplification of quantum state , the quantum state amplification is actually a quantum state transformation , thus it is natural to discuss the amplification of the quantum state using the language of quantum state transformation .",
    "in fact , the language of quantum state transformation provides a unified framework describing the quantum state cloning , the unambiguous discrimination of states , and the quantum state amplification @xcite .    in the quantum operation theory , any physically permissible state transformation of a quantum system",
    "can be determined by a completely positive ( cp ) , linear , trace non - increasing map : @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the transformation is physically realizable in principle if such a map @xmath34 mathematically exists .",
    "the first representation theorem gives the general representation of the cp , linear , trace nonincreasing map @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it states that any cp , linear , trace non - increasing map @xmath34 can be represented by an operator - sum form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the kraus operator that satisfies @xmath37 . for deterministic transformation @xmath38 , while for probabilistic transformation @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the unitary evolution of a quantum system that @xmath40 is a special case of this representation .",
    "another more physical way to represent the map @xmath34 is considering the unitary evolution on an enlarged hilbert space .",

    "the amplification of a specific state is trivial since we can always prepare the system in the expected quantum state . for simplicity , the amplification of a set of @xmath44 linear - independent pure states @xmath45 with @xmath46 is preferred to be considered .",

    "the operator @xmath4 can be a single observable , or represent a set of specific observables , which will not be mentioned below except for the case of necessary .",
    "for any quantum state @xmath48 in the set @xmath49 , there should exist a unitary operation @xmath50 that transforms the state @xmath48 into the corresponding amplified state @xmath51 with the assistance of an ancillary system . in general , the transformation is probabilistic and the successful probability @xmath52 may be varied for different states in the set @xmath49 . for an arbitrary state @xmath48 in set @xmath49 , we thus have the following formula of quantum state transformation : @xmath53 here @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the pointer states that indicate the amplification is successful or failure respectively . the initial state of the ancillary system is simply denoted by @xmath56 and it is assumed that there is no correlation between the system and the ancillary initially .",

    ", the distinguishability of any two states to be amplified does not increase after the deterministic qa .",
