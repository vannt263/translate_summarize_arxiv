    "<S> it is known that fixed boundary conditions modify the leading finite - size corrections for an @xmath0 lattice in @xmath1 at a first - order phase transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that an exponential low - temperature phase degeneracy of the form @xmath4 will lead to a different leading correction of order @xmath5 . a @xmath1 gonihedric ising model with a four - spin interaction , plaquette hamiltonian displays such a degeneracy and we confirm the modified scaling behaviour using high - precision multicanonical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that other models such as the ising antiferromagnet on the fcc lattice , in which the number of `` true '' low - temperature phases is not macroscopically large but which possess an exponentially degenerate number of low lying states may display an effective version of the modified scaling law for the range of lattice sizes accessible in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> +    to some extent first - order phase transitions have been the poor cousins of continuous transitions when it comes to numerical investigations , in spite of their prevalence in nature , see , e.g. , the articles in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial studies of finite - size scaling for first - order transitions were carried out by @xcite and further pursued by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , rigorous results for periodic boundary conditions were derived using pirogov - sinai theory and similar techniques applied to the case of non - periodic boundary conditions , for a review see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to derive the finite - size scaling behaviour at first - order phase transitions using straightforward heuristic arguments discussed in @xcite , rather than the more sophisticated approach of @xcite . to do this , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a simple two - phase model in which the system spends a fraction @xmath6 of its total time in one of @xmath7 ordered phases ( as in a @xmath7-state potts model ) and a fraction @xmath8 in the disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energies are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where the hat is introduced for quantities evaluated at the inverse phase transition temperature of the infinite system , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the model neglects fluctuations within the phases and also treats the flips between the phases as instantaneous jumps . with these assumptions </S>",
    "<S> the energy moments are just the weighted average over the phases , , and from this we can calculate various other derived observables . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> differentiating with respect to @xmath6 then gives a maximum @xmath15 at @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where the disordered and ordered peaks of the energy probability density have equal _ </S>",
    "<S> weight_. we can see that this immediately recovers the @xmath18 scaling of the peak in @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the leading corrections can also be obtained by taylor expanding the ratio of weights around @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of being in any one of the ordered states or the disordered state is related to the free - energy densities @xmath20 of the states by @xmath21 and the fraction of time spent in the ordered states is proportional to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of weights is thus @xmath23 ( up to exponentially small corrections in @xmath24 , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking the logarithm of this ratio gives @xmath25 and expanding around @xmath11 at the finite - size specific - heat maximum where @xmath26 gives @xmath27 , which can be solved for the finite - size peak loation of the specific heat : @xmath28 the @xmath29 leading correction to scaling is immediately apparent . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations of  @xcite for the location @xmath30 of the minimum of the energetic binder parameter @xmath31 give @xmath32 which again displays the @xmath29 correction .    </S>",
    "<S> the key observation is now that an exponential degeneracy in @xmath7 , the number of low - temperature phases , will alter the scaling behaviour because of the presence of the various @xmath33 factors in the leading scaling terms in eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> this plaquette hamiltonian has attracted attention because it displays a strong first - order transition observed first by @xcite and evidence of glass - like behaviour at low temperatures discovered by @xcite .    in the plaquette gonihedric model with @xmath35 , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fss : beta : specheat ] ) , ( [ eq : fss : beta : binder ] ) become @xmath36 and @xmath37 so the leading contribution to the finite - size corrections is now , as expected with the exponential degeneracy , @xmath38 . for the extremal values one also finds non - standard scaling corrections @xmath39 and @xmath40 where the leading correction terms are also modified by a factor of @xmath24 due to the exponential degeneracy compared with the standard case .    to verify the modified scaling we used in @xcite the multicanonical monte carlo algorithm of @xcite where rare states lying between the ordered and disordered phases are promoted artificially , decreasing the autocorrelation time and allowing the system to oscillate more rapidly between phases . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically improve guesses of the energy probability distribution using recursive estimates of @xcite before the actual production run with of the order of @xmath41 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> canonical estimators can then be retrieved by weighting the multicanonical data to yield boltzmann - distributed energies . </S>",
    "<S> reweighting techniques are very powerful when combined with multicanonical simulations , and allow the calculation of observables over a broad range of temperatures . </S>",

    "<S> the observables such as the specific heat ( [ eq : specheat ] ) and binder s energy parameter ( [ eq : binder ] ) have been calculated from the data as function of temperature by reweighting . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fit : orig - pbc ] we find @xmath64 for the infinite lattice inverse transition temperature , where the final error estimate is taken as the smallest error bar of the contributing @xmath65 estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the simulation results and the broad range of lattice sizes clearly excludes fits in all cases to the standard finite - size scaling ansatz , where the first correction is proportional to the inverse volume .    any model with an </S>",
    "<S> exponentially degenerate low - temperature phase will display the modified scaling at a first - order phase transition described for the @xmath1 gonihedric model here . apart from higher - dimensional variants of the gonihedric model or its dual , there are numerous other fields where the scenario could be realized . </S>",
    "<S> examples range from annni models discussed by @xcite to topological `` orbital '' models in the context of quantum computing reviewed by @xcite which all share an extensive ground - state degeneracy . among the orbital models for transition metal compounds , </S>",
    "<S> a particularly promising candidate is the @xmath1 classical compass or @xmath66 orbital model where a highly degenerate ground state is well known and signatures of a first - order transition into the disordered phase have recently been found numerically by @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous other systems , such as the ising antiferromagnet on a @xmath1 fcc lattice , have an exponentially degenerate number of ground states but a small number of true low - temperature phases . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , they do possess an exponentially degenerate number of low - energy excitations so , depending on the nature of the growth of energy barriers with system size , an _ effective _ modified scaling could still be seen at a first - order transition for the lattice sizes accessible in typical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to the true asymptotic standard scaling would then only appear for very large lattices . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , previous simulations of @xcite appear to have found non - standard scaling for the first - order transition in the ising antiferromagnet on a @xmath1 fcc lattice . </S>"
