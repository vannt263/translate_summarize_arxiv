    "rs canum venaticorum ( rs cvn ) variables are described by hall ( 1972 ; see also biermann & hall 1976 ) , as close binaries comprising a g- or k - type subgiant and a f- or g - type star of luminosity class iv ",
    "v with the following special property ( see also zeilik  1979 ) : their light curves are characterized by long waves with amplitudes up to 0.2 mag which , if the binary is eclipsing , as a rule move towards smaller phase of the orbital light curve .",
    "this is typically interpreted as the effect of large star spots on one hemisphere of the cool component when rotating with a speed slightly different from the synchronous rotation ( e.g. catalano 1983 ) .",
    "thus , these waves are assumed to be the beat between the orbital period and the slightly out - of - phase differential rotation of the spotted star .",
    "the assumption of substantial chromospheric activity is supported by additional observational features , such as strong emission lines , lively flaring activity in the optical and other spectral regions and variable x - ray emission ( e.g. walter  1980 , charles 1983 ) .",
    "as part of our programme of investigating the optical long - term behaviour of selected rosat sources ( e.g. richter  1995 ) we discovered a new variable star as the likely optical counterpart of rx j2009.8 + 1557 .",
    "this object which we called s 10947 aql , varies in the b band between 134 and 148 .",

    "rx j2009.8 + 1557 was detected during the rosat all - sky survey in 1990 at a count rate of 0.019@xmath10.005 cts / s with a likelihood of detection of 12.4 ( corresponding to about 4@xmath2 confidence ) . with a total of only 9 counts collected during the total exposure time of 495 sec",
    "this source is below the brightness limit of the 1 rxs catalog ( voges  1999 )",

    "altogether 709 archival plates taken between 1934 and 1995 of the sonneberg astrographs 400 mm , 170 mm and 140 mm were used for investigating the long - term behaviour of s 10947 aql . tab .",
    "[ phot ] gives the details of these measurements .",
    "unfortunately , the object is invisible on all plates of the sonneberg sky patrol .",
    "spectroscopic observations of s 10947 aql do not exist , but the kind of brightness changes together with the detected x - ray emission seem to indicate that it is a chromospherically active binary of the rs cvn type .",
    "the major results of the variability study can be summarized as follows :    * we find occasional brightness humps which can be recognized and followed over several months to years , with a cycle length of about p@xmath19 = 8628 ( in the mean ) and an amplitude of @xmath20 0.5 mag ( migrating waves ) . *",
    "eclipsing minima occur with a mean period of p@xmath21 = 86294 . *",
    "we observe the occasional disappearance of the eclipsing minima ( see fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this is probably only partly caused by the overlapping of the minima with the maxima of the migrating waves .",
    "also , in some other rs cvn stars the depth of the primary minima varies , but it does not approach zero as is the case in s 10947 ( e.g. rt lac : the amplitude varies between about 0.7 and 1.0 mag , see evren 1989 ; ux uma : the amplitude varies from 0.4 to about 0.6 mag , see geyer 1980 ) .",

    "according to the classical interpretation of rs cvn stars the brightness changes can be interpreted solely by starspot activities in a binary system ( e.g. geyer 1976 ) .",
    "but until now it was not yet possible to unambiguously explain the physical processes in rs cvn systems .",
    "this is because photoelectric and spectroscopic observations are not available to a sufficient extent since the phenomenon was discovered by hall ( 1972 ) .",
    "systematic changes of the orbital period are observed also in most other rs cvn systems .",
    "hall & kreiner ( 1980 ) and hall  ( 1980 ) gave a compilation of 34 such objects where both , decreasing and increasing periods are found in the ratio of about 2:1 .",
    "the value of dlog @xmath26/d@xmath27 = 2.3 @xmath10 10@xmath28 for s 10947 is large but not extraordinary .",
    "it is surpassed only by sz psc ( 5.25 @xmath10 10@xmath28 ) , cq aur ( 2.45 @xmath10 10@xmath28 ) and ar mon ( 1.22 @xmath10 10@xmath28 ) .    in any case , large period changes are an indication of rapid evolutionary efects ( e.g. p. 427",
    "in kopal 1978 ) . however , it is difficult to estimate more details , such as mass loss or mass transfer rates in rs cvn stars because the period changes may be caused by effects which are not directly related to the mass transfer in the binary system .",
    "as far as known , rs cvn stars have binary components of similar mass . though rs cvn stars are detached systems , mass exchange , if occuring , does not much influence the period length .",
    "though evren ( 1989 ) shows that in the case of rt lac an intermittent gas flow seems to exist between the binary components , additional quantities must be known to answer this question with more confidence . hall ( 1972 ) , for example , proposes that ejection of matter in regions of very strong starspot activity on one side of the cooler component may give large contributions to the changes in orbital period ( rocket effect ) .",
    "sahade & wood ( 1978 , on page 66 ) write that `` the large period changes found in the rs cvn variables are still not well understood ... and the energy required to eject larger amounts of mass must be very large '' .",
    "other authors ( e.g. kopal 1978 ) state that it is difficult to estimate the mass loss . nevertheless , hall & kreiner ( 1980 ) and hall  ( 1980 ) tried to give crude estimates of the range of mass loss rates in 34 rs cvn - type stars based on the hypothetical assumptions of magnetic field strengths and further quantities .",
    "they got values up to about 10@xmath28 /yr in some extreme cases .",
    ".observed minima and @xmath29 values [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ omc ]    as already mentioned , the eclipsing minima in s 10947 occasionally disappear ( see fig . 2 and 3 ) . apart from s 10947",
    "only very few binaries ( none of which is a rs cvn star ) are known to have occasionally vanishing eclipse amplitudes , and thus not much is known about their cause .",
    "there are several possible explanations for varying eclipse amplitudes :    * _ triple system _ : an obvious explanation of varying orbital period and eclipse depth is due to the influence of a third body in orbit ( e.g. africano & wilson 1976 ) .",
    "this possibility was later abandoned as a general explanation since ( i ) @xmath29 variations were actually observed in too many cataclysmic variables to attribute all to third bodies , and ( ii ) for the case of ux uma the apparent sinusoidal @xmath29 variation was found not to repeat ( rubinstein  1991 ) .",
    "one exception is ss lac which has ceased eclipsing completely .",
    "this is believed to be due to a change of the orbital inclination angle caused by a third stellar component which gives not only rise to an apsidal motion of probably @xmath13 1000 years , but also to a periodic oscillation of the orbital inclination with a very long time scale ( milone  2000 , torres & stefanik 2000 ) . * _ dust obscuration _ :",
    "irregularities of production and destruction of carbon dust can hide the minima .",
    "as far as we know , this phenomenon primarily leads to small amplitude variations rather than a change of 0.5 mag as observed in s 10947 . *",
    "_ strong wind _ : variations of the accretion rate may easily affect variations in the amount of matter expelled by the system in a wind .",
    "as an example , the eclipsing binary cv ser ( not a rs cvn star ) showed no eclipse light variations at all in 1970 . according to cowley  ( 1977 ) ( see also hoffmeister  1984 ) , it is not one of the stellar binary components which is eclipsed , but rather some bright material between the stars .    for s 10947 , the short time scale and the non - periodic behaviour of the times of vanishing amplitude seem to rule out the influence of a third component .",
    "we therefore suppose that these eclipses are caused by circumstellar matter or changes in the accretion disk , variable in size and/or brightness .",
    "this supports earlier statements by hall & ramsey ( 1992 ) that extended matter in rs cvn systems may play a greater role than hitherto assumed .",
    "because of ( 1 ) the small difference to the best - fit x - ray position of only @xmath135  ( far below the x - ray position error ) , ( 2 ) the lack of any other optical objects within the x - ray error circle brighter than 19 mag .",
    "and ( 3 ) a x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio of @xmath30 which is in the range exhibited by rs cvn stars , we are quite certain about the identification of rx j2009.8 + 1557 with s 10947 aql .      this work demonstrates the importance of plate archives where many still unknown secrets and information are hidden .",
    "detailed spectroscopic observations are urgently needed to further the understanding of this enigmatic source s 10947 aql .",
    "also , continued long - term monitoring should determine the further evolution of the @xmath29 curve , and thus can prove / disprove the influence of a third body .",
