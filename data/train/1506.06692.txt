    "we present a new method for proving separation of eigenvalues for disordered quantum mechanical hamiltonians on the lattice , in the strong disorder or weak hopping regime .",
    "the traditional approach to this question is based on minami s method @xcite .",
    "when available , it provides a bound on the probability of two or more eigenvalues in an interval , and thus gives probabilistic control on the separation of eigenvalues .",
    "variants of the minami estimate have been an important blackcomponent of proofs of poisson statistics for eigenvalues in an interval @xcite .",
    "they are important for understanding the behavior of the ac conductivity @xcite .",
    "they blackalso lead to minimum level - spacing estimates and simplicity of the spectrum , provided the probability distribution of the potential is hlder continuous with index @xmath0 @xcite .    obtaining minami - type estimates",
    "has been problematic for so - called ` non - monotone ' models , in which the variation of the single - site potential with the random variables may change in sign from point to point in space .",
    "while there are a number of results on localization for non - monotone models @xcite , there are only a couple of multi - level results that we are aware of .",
    "simplicity of the spectrum in infinite volume is established in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a minami estimate is proven for some non - monotone models that admit a transformation to a monotone situation . in @xcite",
    "an @xmath1-level minami estimate is proven for a class of random block models , in which a @xmath2 random block hamiltonian sits at each site of the lattice , and the blocks are coupled through a deterministic hopping matrix .",
    "the randomness must be sufficiently rich to ensure the success of the method .",
    "of particular interest is the case of @xmath3 blocks of the form @xmath4 ; blackminami estimates were obtained in @xcite in the situation in which both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath7-regular random variables .",
    "still , this leaves out the case where @xmath6 is deterministic , which may be called a fully diluted model ( meaning that there is only one degree of freedom in the randomness for each block ) .    in this work",
    "we consider a fully diluted random block hamiltonian with @xmath3 block @xmath8 .",
    "this is a model originally proposed by spencer ; localization and hlder continuity of the integrated density of states are proven in @xcite .",
    "we prove a probabilistic statement on minimum eigenvalue spacing . specifically , we give a bound showing that the probability that the minimum eigenvalue separation is less than @xmath9 tends to zero with @xmath9 .",
    "( see theorem [ thm:2.3 ] below ) .",
    "our interest in this problem stems from recent work @xcite in which a minimum eigenvalue separation condition ( called limited level attraction ) was used as an assumption in a proof of many - body localization for a one - dimensional spin chain .",
    "although the separation condition remains unproven in the many - body context , one may perhaps gain some insight into the problem by replacing the tensor product of @xmath3 spin spaces with a direct sum , and this leads to the random block hamiltonian considered in this paper .",
    "the dilution of randomness is not as extreme as in the many - body case , but it remains an important issue nevertheless .",
    "the method should be of interest in its own right .",
    "we use a sequence of schur complements to reduce the hilbert space to subspaces of smaller and smaller dimension . at the same time",
    ", we shrink the width of the energy interval under consideration , and eventually only one eigenvalue remains .",
    "the subspaces are structured in physical space as a set of extended blocks whose ( renormalized ) spectrum is in a small neighborhood of some energy @xmath10 .",
    "the schur complement formula produces effective hamiltonians for the blocks exhibiting exponential decay in the distance between blocks .",
    "the blocks themselves become more and more dilute as the procedure proceeds , so the distance between blocks grows , and hence inter - block matrix elements tend rapidly to zero .",
    "the key probabilistic input involves estimating the probability that a block has spectrum close to @xmath10 , and bounding the probability that a block has a very small level spacing .",
    "the determinant and the discriminant of the schur complement matrix for a block is a polynomial in the random variables ( the degree depends on the size of the block ) .",
    "this ensures a degree of transversality of eigenvalues of subsystems ( and their differences )  although not uniformly in the size of the subsystem . we obtain a rather weak bound on the probability of spectrum near @xmath10 ( replacing the usual wegner estimate @xcite ) and the probability of near - degeneracy ( replacing the usual minami estimate ) .",
    "although the bound degenerates as the size of the block gets large , large blocks are improbable to begin with , and the trade - off determines the form of our results on density of states and level separation .",
    "there is some similarity with the method of @xcite , in which localization is proven for a hamiltonian depending analytically on the random variables . in those works , the wegner estimate is replaced with a transversality condition arising from polynomial approximation of determinants ( using a version of cartan lemma proven in @xcite ) .    as in @xcite",
    ", we give a direct construction of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in terms of convergent graphical expansions that depend on the random variables only within each graph .",
    "however , we gain some precision by working near a fixed energy ( as advocated by @xcite ) . we have also been influenced by ideas in @xcite ( the feshbach map ) and of course by @xcite .",
    "we consider the following non - monotone anderson model .",
    "a particle hops in @xmath11 , a rectangle in @xmath12 , with each position black@xmath13 having two states , + and . the single - position hamiltonian is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a collection of bounded iid random variables with a bounded density . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume each @xmath16 has a uniform distribution on [ -1,1 ] .",

    "let @xmath19 .",
    "the hopping matrix is @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the @xmath3 identity matrix for the internal space , @xmath22 is a small parameter , and @xmath23 here @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we define the hamiltonian @xmath25 one could of course consider a much wider class of models . however , this choice will serve to illustrate the method in a simple context exhibiting both non - monotonicity and dilution . that is , the `` bare '' energies @xmath26 in ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) move in opposite directions as @xmath16 varies , and there is only one random variable @xmath16 for each @xmath3 block of @xmath27 .",
    "our goal is first to prove localization by controlling the density of states and by showing stretched exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator @xmath28 .",
    "second , we prove probabilistic bounds on level spacing by constructing individual eigenstates and controlling their separation in energy from the others .",

    "let @xmath32 denote the number of eigenvalues of @xmath33 in @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35    although this bound goes to zero faster than any power of @xmath36 , it does not imply hlder continuity of the integrated density of states .",

    "if we restrict the sum in ( [ ( 1.5b ) ] ) to eigenvalues in @xmath34 , we prove a similar bound but with a prefactor tending to zero like the right - hand side of ( [ ( 1.5a ) ] )  corollary [ cor:2.2 ] .",
    "blackwe prove these results partly as a warm - up to the level - spacing problem  but it is also helpful to understand how strong a result is possible with our method and to make comparisons with the fractional - moment results .    finally , we give our main result on minimum level spacing .",
