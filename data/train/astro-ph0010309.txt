    "most generic models of inflationary scenario give two unique predictions : @xmath0 and @xmath21 ( see e.g. steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "the first of these predications is confirmed by boomerang and maxima .",
    "the analysis of cobe - dmr data is consistent with @xmath22 ( bennett _ et al _ 1996 , bunn & white 1996 ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to believe that the current data is in good agreement with these predictions .",
    "we fix the value of these two parameters based on these considerations and use @xmath0 and @xmath23 throughout .",
    "( it should be pointed out that @xmath0 is a stricter requirement of inflation than @xmath22 ; one gets @xmath22 only for exponential inflation ; see e.g. steinhardt 1995 . ) also note that we are not concerned with the origin of the values @xmath0 and @xmath24 . for example , these could arise merely from the requirement of scale invariance for the background universe ( giving @xmath25 ) and the perturbations ( giving @xmath26 ) without invoking inflation  as was originally done by harrison and zeldovich , years before inflation was invented ( harrison 1970 , zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "but , of course , inflationary models made these parameter values fairly well accepted .",
    "other parameters like @xmath19 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can not be fixed by theoretical considerations alone . in our analysis",
    "we assume a non - zero @xmath19 because recent high - z sn1a observations suggest a non - zero cosmological constant ( perlmutter _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , riess _",
    "we do not consider cmbr anisotropies from tensor perturbations as most models of inflation give negligible contribution from tensor perturbations for @xmath27 ( steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "re - ionization of universe can also alter primary cmbr anisotropies significantly .",
    "present observations suggest that the universe is ionized up to @xmath28 . for",
    "the cmbr anisotropies to be significantly altered by re - ionization , the minimum re - ionization redshift should lie between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see e.g. bond 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , keeping the constraints from present observations in mind , we neglect the effect of re - ionization on the measured cmbr anisotropies .",
    "we fix the value of @xmath31 , and compute the confidence levels on the best - fit values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and @xmath4 from maxima and boomerang observations .",
    "the range of parameters in which the minimum of @xmath32 is searched is : @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath32 for the model comparison with observations is given by : @xmath36 here @xmath37 ( 10 points from maxima and 12 points from boomerang ) , @xmath38 are the measured band - powers and @xmath39 are the theoretical band - powers , @xmath40 are the errors on measured band - powers .",
    "we do not take into account the calibration uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "the theoretical band - powers are calculated using the cmbr boltzmann code cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , which gives cobe - normalized ( normalized according to the fitting formula of bunn & white ( 1996 ) ) angular power spectra .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) assumes that different band - powers are uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption is valid only if the anisotropies are measured over the entire sky ( see e.g. peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "we assume lack of correlation in this work also because the covariance matrix of band - powers has not been made public yet .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) implicitly assumes that the likelihood function is gaussian in band - powers near its maximum .",
    "while this assumption is true in principle , in practice there can be significant deviation from gaussianity near the maximum .",
    "bond , jaffe , and knox ( 2000 ) advocate using another variable instead of band - powers for doing the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "we do not use it here .",
    "however , while quoting errors we do not use the fisher matrix approach which can give meaningful results only for the gaussian case . instead we directly give the confidence levels on @xmath41 .",
    "our results are shown in figures  1 and  2 . the @xmath32 for 22 data points from boomerang and maxima with three fitted parameters ( i.e. 19 degrees of freedom ) is 22.4 , which is an excellent fit ( goodness - of - fit probability , @xmath42 ) . the best fit values and @xmath43 errors are : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the best fit model along with boomerang and maxima data points is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the range of allowed @xmath2 is in fair agreement with the measurement of @xmath2 from local observations ( for a recent summary of these results , see primack 2000 ) .",
    "recent sn1a suggest that that the universe is flat with @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( 1@xmath49 ) .",
    "this is within @xmath50 of the value inferred by our analysis .    in figure  1",
    "we show the confidence levels in the @xmath51 plane .",
    "the region bounded by the contours correspond to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which , for gaussian errors , corresponds to 68  % ( 1@xmath49 ) and 95.4  % ( 2@xmath49 ) for two - parameter fits .",
    "we also show the 95% region allowed by primordial nucleosynthesis observations ( for a recent review see tytler _",
    "et al _ 2000 ) .",
    "as seen in the figure , the region allowed by cmbr observations is at variance with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis at at least 95% level .",
    "this result is in agreement with other analyses on the same data set ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 , jaffe _ et al _ 2000 ) .",
    "the region corresponding to one and two @xmath49 in the @xmath54 plane is shown in figure  2 .",
    "our results show that the current cmbr observations favour a universe with age @xmath55 and are incompatible with a universe of age @xmath56 at @xmath57 level . though this is on the lower side of the expected age of the universe from estimated ages of globular clusters , etc .",
    ", this is not in disagreement with those observations ( for a recent status report see primack 2000 ) .",
    "another important constraint on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 comes from the shape of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering ( see e.g. bond 1996 ) .",
    "these observations , within the context of a flat model with cosmological constant , give @xmath58 .",
    "we plot this region in the @xmath54 plane in figure  2 .",
    "if we require that @xmath59 , as most recent measurements of @xmath2 suggest ( primack 2000 ) , then cmbr observations exclude the region required to satisfy the galaxy clustering observations by more than @xmath60 confidence level .    in conclusion , recent boomerang and maxima observations , within the context of simplest inflationary models ( @xmath0 and @xmath23 ) ,",
    "imply : ( 1 ) too large a of value of @xmath61 to be compatible with primordial nucleosynthesis observations , ( 2 ) an age of universe @xmath62 , and ( 3 ) too large a value of @xmath7 to be in agreement with the shape of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering . in view of this , it is safe to conclude that the models with @xmath0 and @xmath8 are ruled out by these observations .",
