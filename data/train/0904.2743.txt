    "the presence of a scalar field is motivated by many ideas in high energy physics and quantum gravities , although it has not been discovered experimentally .",
    "tev - scale experiments at lhc and tevatron may be able to confirm its existence .",
    "it is nevertheless widely accepted in several theoretical modeling frameworks , especially in contemporary cosmology , in which an early - time accelerated expansion , i.e. , inflation , is proposed to be driven by a scalar field in order to solve horizon and flatness problems @xcite .",
    "after inflation , components of barotropic fluids such as radiation and other non - relativistic matter were produced during reheating and cooling - down processes .",
    "a scalar field was also believed to be responsible for the present acceleration in various models of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the present acceleration is strongly backed up by various observations , e.g. the cosmic microwave background @xcite , large - scale structure surveys @xcite and sne type ia observations @xcite .",
    "power - law cosmology , where @xmath5 , describes an acceleration phase if @xmath6 .",
    "modelling the present expansion with a power - law function where @xmath7 was found to be consistent with nucleosynthesis @xcite , the age of high - redshift objects such as globular clusters @xcite , sne ia data @xcite , sne ia with @xmath8 data @xcite , and x - ray gas mass fraction measurement of galaxy clusters @xcite . in the context of the power - law model , other aspects such as gravitational lensing statistics @xcite ,",
    "angular size - redshift data of compact radio sources @xcite , and sn ia magnitude - redshift relation @xcite have also been studied .",
    "originally , the power - law expansion has its motivation from the simplest inflationary model that can remove the flatness and horizon problems with simple spectrum @xcite . for the present universe , the idea of linear coasting cosmology ( @xmath9 ) @xcite can resolve the age problem of the cdm model @xcite while as well agreeing with the nucleosynthesis constraint .",
    "the coasting model arises from non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory in which the scalar field couples to the curvature to contribute to the energy density that cancels out the vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "the model could also be a result of the domination of an su(2 ) cosmological instanton @xcite .",
    "here our assumption is that the universe is expanding in the form of the power law function .",
    "two major ingredients are scalar field dark energy evolving under the scalar field potential @xmath10 , and barotropic fluid consisting of cold dark matter and baryons .",
    "we derive the potential , and use the combined wmap5 data @xcite as well as the wmap5 data alone to determine the values of @xmath11 and other relevant parameters of the potential .",
    "the numerical results are subsequently compared and discussed .",
    "two perfect fluids , the cold dark matter and scalar field @xmath12 , in the late flrw universe of the simplest cdm model with zero cosmological constant are considered .",
    "the time evolution of the barotropic fluid is governed by the fluid equation @xmath13 with a solution @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a proportional constant . for the scalar field ,",
    "supposed that it is minimally coupled to gravity , its lagrangian density is @xmath17 .",
    "the energy density and pressure are @xmath18 the fluid equation of the field describing its energy conservation as the universe expands is @xmath19 total energy density @xmath20 and total pressure @xmath21 of the mixture are simply the sums of those contributed by each fluid , for which the friedmann equation is @xmath22 it is straightforward to show that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is related to the reduced planck mass @xmath25 by @xmath26 .",
    "the power - law scale factor is @xmath27 without fixing @xmath28 at the present time because we have implicitly rescaled it to allow for @xmath29 taking only either one of the three discrete values @xmath30 .",
    "the hubble parameter is @xmath31 our goal is to construct @xmath32 using recent observational data , as far as the simplest cdm model is concerned .",
    "we will work with observational data in si units . restoring the physical constants in place , we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 and we have set @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for dust ) . incorporating and into the above equation , we obtain @xmath37 we shall consider contribution of the first term alone in comparison to total contribution when including the second ( the curvature ) and the third ( density ) terms .      using the equation for the hubble parameter at the present time , we have @xmath38 the sign of @xmath29 depends on the sign of the density parameter @xmath39 . in our convention here , @xmath40 for a closed universe , @xmath41 for a flat one , and @xmath42 for an open one",
    ". the present value of the scale factor can be found from the definition of @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 the density constant @xmath45 can be found from , @xmath46 where @xmath47 i.e. the sum of the present density parameters of the barotropic fluid components .",
    "@xmath48 is the present value of the critical density .",
    "the neutrino contribution is assumed to be negligible .",
    "the values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are taken from observational data .",
    "we work on two sets of data provided by @xcite .",
    "one comes solely from the wmap5 data and the other is the wmap5 data combined with distance measurements from type ia supernovae ( sn ) and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the distribution of galaxies . for @xmath50 , @xmath49 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , we take their maximum likelihood values .",
    "the curvature density parameter @xmath54 comes as a range with 95% confidence level on deviation from the simplest @xmath55cdm model .",
    "the data are shown in table [ datatable ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the exponent @xmath11 from the two sets of data are only slightly different , but only the latter is an accelerated expansion as @xmath6 .",
    "the determination of @xmath11 from x - ray gas mass fractions in galaxy clusters favours open universe with @xmath6 ( @xmath56 ) @xcite and combined analysis from snls and @xmath8 data ( from germini deep deep survey ) assuming open geometry yields @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "note that , in the power - law regime , @xmath11 only depends on the observed values of the hubble constant and @xmath50 .",
    "this may give an impression that the maximum likelihood values from the combined data has yet to be relied upon , but the power - law expansion has not been proven to be the case nonetheless .",
    "m@xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the crosses mark their inflection points .",
    "also plotted in dash lines are their first terms .",
    "each potential does not actually converge to its first term , but later intersect with and deviate from it , though still very close together .",
    "however , this occurs much later ( at @xmath59 sec @xmath60 gyr in both cases ) .",
    ", width=307 ]    , @xmath61 is real.,width=307 ]    after @xmath62 , the potential from each data behaves like its first term , i.e. decreasing in its value while increasing in its slope ( being less and less negative ) .",
    "the other terms quickly become weaker .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ potentialplots ] . since the first term is contributed only by @xmath63 ( and its time derivative ) , it is dominant in the post - inflection phase .",
    "in fact , the convergence to zero of the potential is slower than its first term alone ( see ( [ firstpotential ] ) and ( [ secondpotential ] ) ) , because the sum of the last two terms consequently becomes positive before converging to zero .",
    "this means that the plots of each potential and its first term in fig .",
    "[ potentialplots ] eventually crosses , but it occurs much , much later at @xmath64 gyr . along with the potential function in , we also obtain the solution @xmath65 in si units . using wmap5+bao+sn dataset , @xmath66 where , for wmap5 dataset alone",
    ", @xmath67 in the late post - inflection phase , the first term is dominant over the @xmath29 and @xmath45 terms then the last two terms of the radicands are negligible ( fig .",
    "[ scalarfieldplots ] ) .",
    "the above two equations are approximated as @xmath68 whereas , for wmap5 dataset alone , @xmath69 the radicand in ( [ secondscalarfield ] ) of the wmap5 dataset is zero at approximately @xmath70 gyr ( see fig .",
    "[ scalarfieldplots ] ) , therefore so does @xmath61 . while the combined dataset has the zero radicand ( then zero @xmath61 ) in ( [ firstscalarfield ] ) later at approximately @xmath71 gyr .",
    "scalar field exact solutions for the power - law cosmology with non - zero curvature and non - zero matter density are reported in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the general exact form of the potential , that renders scaling solution , is some negative powers of a hyperbolic sine @xcite .",
    "we consider a potential function of a homogeneous scalar field in late - time flrw universe of the simplest cdm model with zero cosmological constant , assuming power - law expansion . the scalar field",
    "is minimally coupled to gravity and the other fluid is non - relativistic barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "we use two sets of observational data , combined wmap5+bao+sn dataset and wmap5 dataset , as the inputs .",
    "potential functions are obtained using numerical values from the observations .",
    "mean values of both sets suggest slightly closed geometry .",
    "the wmap5 dataset implies accelerated expansion ( @xmath0 ) while the combined dataset gives @xmath1 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the value obtained from snls and @xmath8 data ( @xmath57 ) @xcite and x - ray gas mass fraction ( @xmath72 ) @xcite .",
    "our result is independent of the geometry unlike @xmath11 obtained from @xcite which assumes open geometry . for closed universe",
    ", the wmap5 dataset puts the lower limit of @xmath3 for @xmath2 while the combined dataset puts the lower limit of @xmath4 .",
    "we characterise the domination of the first term of ( [ vt ] ) by using the inflection of the potential plots from which the first term is found to be dominant to the potential 5.3 gyr after the big bang in both datasets .",
