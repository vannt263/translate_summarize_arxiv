    "( 2001 ) showed that more than half of the sdb stars in their selected sample are members of close binaries .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations on the formation of sdb stars in the past .",

    "sdb stars in binaries can form through various binary channels , involving either stable and conservative mass transfer ( mengel , norris & gross 1976 ) or dynamical mass transfer and common - envelope evolution ( paczyski 1976 ) .    to understand the formation of sdb stars , han et al .",
    "( hereafter paper i ) have performed a systematic study of the various binary evolution channels that can produce sdb stars . using simplified binary population synthesis ( bps ) simulations for some of the channels",
    ", they showed that all of these proposed channels proposed are viable in principle .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to quantitatively assess the relative importance of the various channels by performing a full binary population synthesis study and by constraining the theoretical models from the observed properties of the population of sdb stars .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we briefly summarize the observations of sdb stars and the principal formation channels , respectively .",
    "we describe our bps code and the model parameters in section 4 and constrain some of the main model parameters in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we carry out a large number of bps simulations and present the main results , which are then discussed in detail in section 7 .",
    "the conclusions in section 8 summarize the main findings of the present study .",
    "there have been extensive observations of sdb stars during the past decades .",
    "magnitude - limited samples of sdb stars , selected by colour , have been made from the palomar green ( pg ) survey @xcite ( @xmath13 ) and the kitt peak downes ( kpd ) survey @xcite ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "saffer et al .  ( 1994 ) measured atmospheric parameters , such as effective temperature , surface gravity and photospheric helium abundance , for a sample of 68 sdb stars .",
    "ferguson , green & liebert found 19 sdb binaries with main - sequence ( ms ) companions from the pg survey and derived a binary frequency of about 50 percent .",
    "allard et al . found 31 sdb binaries from 100 candidates chosen from the pg survey and the kpd colourimetric survey , and estimated that 54 to 66 percent of sdb stars are in binaries with ms companions after taking selection effects into account .",
    "thejll , ulla & macdonald and ulla & thejll found that more than half of their sdb star candidates showed infrared flux excesses , indicating the presence of binary companions .",
    "aznar cuadrado & jeffery obtained atmospheric parameters for 34 sdb stars from spectral energy distributions and concluded that 15 of these were single and 19 binaries with ms companions .",
    "all of these observations indicated that more than half of sdb stars were in binaries .",
    "( note , however , that some of the ms ` companions ' to sdb stars are optical doubles and are not physically related . )",
    "more recently , it has become possible to determine some of the orbital parameters , such as orbital periods and mass functions , for a significant sample of close sdb binaries @xcite . in particular , maxted et al",
    ".   concluded that more than two thirds of their candidates were binaries with short orbital periods from hours to days , and that 7 of 11 sdb binaries with known companion types had wd companions .",
    "since this study has very well - defined selection criteria , it provides an excellent data set to help constrain the theoretical models .",
    "the main selection effects in the data set are : a ) a selection in the pg survey against sdb stars with companions of spectral type g and k ( which show composite spectra ) and companions of earlier spectral types ( which dominate the optical light output ) ; b ) the major fraction of candidates was selected from a narrow strip in the @xmath15 diagram for sdb stars with masses of @xmath16 which are believed to be in the core helium - burning phase ; c ) the radial - velocity semi - amplitudes ( @xmath17 ) of all sdb binaries with known orbital periods are larger than 30 kms@xmath18 .",
    "we therefore exclude in some of our comparisons all systems with smaller semi - amplitudes .",
    "this selects the sample against systems with long orbital periods and/or low companion masses . in principle , orbital periods for binaries with semi - amplitudes as low as 10kms@xmath18 can be detected , but because of their typically long expected orbital periods no periods have yet been determined observationally @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to these selection effects as the gk selection effect ( a ) , the strip selection effect ( b ) and the k selection effect ( c ) , respectively .",
    "we consider sdb stars to be core helium - burning stars with masses around @xmath12 with extremely thin hydrogen - rich envelopes @xcite .",
    "the main binary channels that can produce sdb stars were discussed in detail in paper i. here we restrict ourselves to summarizing some of their main features .      in this channel , the primary component ,",
    "i.e. the initially more massive star of the binary , experiences dynamical mass transfer on the fgb .",
    "this leads to a ce and a spiral - in phase , typically leaving a very close binary after the envelope has been ejected . if the core of the giant still ignites helium it produces a sdb star in a short - period binary with a main - sequence companion .",
    "depending on the initial mass of the primary , one has to distinguish between two sub - channels .",
    "if the initial mass is below the helium flash mass @xmath19 , i.e. the maximum zams mass below which a star experiences a helium flash at the tip of the fgb ( @xmath20 for pop i , @xmath21 for @xmath22 , see   3.2 of paper i ) , the primary must fill its roche lobe when it is already quite close to the tip of the fgb in order to be able to ignite helium .",
    "all sdb stars formed through this channel should have masses just below the critical core mass for the helium flash and have a mass distribution peaked around @xmath23 .",
    "the orbital period distribution typically ranges from 0.05 to @xmath24d .",
    "if the zams mass is higher than the helium flash mass , the primary does not have to be close to the tip of the fgb since more massive primaries will ignite helium ( in this case under non - degenerate conditions ) even if they lose their envelopes when passing through the hertzsprung gap .",
    "however , since the envelopes of stars in the hertzsprung gap are much more tightly bound than on the fgb , systems that experience dynamical mass transfer in the hertzsprung gap are more likely to merge completely than to survive as short - period binaries . as a consequence",
    "this sub - channel does not contribute much to the formation of sdb stars , although it should be noted that these would generally contain sdb stars of lower mass ( as low as @xmath25 ) and tend to have very short orbital periods .",
    "if the first mass - transfer phase is stable , the primary will also lose most of its envelope producing a sdb star with a ms companion but in this case in a wide orbit with orbital periods between @xmath26 and 2000d .",
    "the orbital period depends on how angular momentum is lost from the system with the shortest periods resulting from systems that experience stable rlof near the beginning of the hertzsprung gap .    similarly to the previous channel",
    ", one has to distinguish between two sub - channels .",
    "if the primary has a zams mass below the helium flash mass , roche - lobe overflow has to occur near the tip of the fgb which again leads to a sharp peak in the mass distribution around @xmath23 .",
    "if the primary has a zams mass larger than the helium flash mass and the system experiences stable rlof in the hertzsprung gap ( so - called early case b mass transfer ) , this also leads to the formation of a sdb star , as was shown in detailed binary evolution calculations by han , tout & eggleton .",
    "we adopt these models to define the evolution for this sub - channel . in this case",
    ", the mass of the sdb star can have a very wide range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , although the more massive sdb stars are less likely because of their lower realization probability due to the initial mass function .",
    "this channel is similar to the first ce ejection channel , except that the companion to the giant is already a white dwarf .",
    "this can lead to a shorter orbital period of the sdb binary after the ce ejection since the wd companion has a much smaller radius than a ms star and a wd can penetrate much deeper into the ce and cause its ejection ; i.e. it can avoid the complete merging of the two components .",
    "therefore sdb stars from this channel have a wider range of orbital periods , and their companions are wds",
    ".    again there are two sub - channels depending on the initial mass of the giant . however , unlike the first ce ejection channel , the more massive channel contributes more to the sdb population since it is easier to eject the envelope of a star in the hertzsprung gap if the companion is a white dwarf .",
    "the masses of sdb stars from the first sub - channel are @xmath29 , while the masses of those from the second are @xmath30 .",
    "this channel is similar to the first stable rlof channel .",
    "however , in order to have stable rlof , the zams mass of the giant is very restricted ( the mass ratio of the giant to the wd , @xmath31 , has to be below a value of @xmath321.3 ; see table  3 of paper i ) .",
    "this generally requires very massive wd companions .",
    "since these are very rare , this channel is unlikely to contribute much to the sdb star population .",
    "in fact in our simulations , we do not produce any sdb stars from this channel since the wd companions tend not to be sufficiently massive .",
    "binaries containing two helium wds may be produced after either two ce phases or one stable rlof phase and one ce phase @xcite .",
    "if their orbital period is sufficiently short , the systems will shrink due to gravitational wave radiation , and the two helium white dwarfs may coalesce .",
    "if the merger product ignites helium , this again leads to the formation of a single sdb star ( saio & jeffery 2001 ) with a fairly wide mass distribution ( @xmath33 to @xmath34 ; see paper i ) .",
    "the bps code used here was originally developed in 1994 and has been updated regularly ever since @xcite .",
    "the main input into the code is a grid of stellar models .",
    "we use 3 grids of older models for metallicities @xmath35 , 0.004 and 0.001 , which do not include convective overshooting or stellar winds . for the purpose of the present study",
    ", we calculated 6 new grids for @xmath35 and 0.004 .",
    "these are smaller and cover a smaller range of masses  as appropriate for the study of sdb stars .",
    "the new grids include stellar winds and convective overshooting ( see paper i for a more detailed description ) .",
    "the code needs to model the evolution of binary stars as well as of single stars .",
    "single stars are evolved according to the model grids , while the evolution of binaries is more complicated due to the occurrence of rlof .",
    "a binary usually experiences two phases of rlof ; the first when the primary fills its roche lobe which may produce a wd binary and the second when the secondary fills its roche lobe .",
    "the mass gainer in the first rlof phase is most likely a ms star .",
    "if the mass ratio @xmath36 at the onset of rlof is lower than a critical value @xmath10 , rlof is stable @xcite . for systems experiencing their first phase of rlof in the hertzsprung gap",
    ", we use @xmath37 as is supported by a simple model due to p.p .",
    "eggleton ( private communication ) and by detailed binary evolution calculations han et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the first rlof phase on the fgb or agb we use three different prescriptions to examine the consequences of varying this important criterion :    1 .",
    "@xmath38}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the core mass fraction .",
    "this criterion was derived by hjellming & webbink and webbink for conservative mass transfer and a mass donor modelled as a polytrope ( also see soberman et al .",
    "1997 ) . for examples involving non - conservative mass transfer ,",
    "see han et al .",
    "2 .   @xmath40 3 .",
    "@xmath41    we assume that a fraction @xmath42 of the mass lost from the primary is transferred onto the gainer , while the rest is lost from the system ( @xmath43 means that rlof is conservative ) .",
    "note that we assume that mass transfer during the main - sequence phase is assumed to be always conservative .",
    "the mass lost from the system also takes away angular momentum , for which we adopt two different choices :    1 .",
    "the mass lost takes away the same specific angular momentum as the orbital angular momentum of the primary 2 .",
    "the mass lost takes away a specific angular momentum @xmath44 in units of the specific angular momentum of the system .",
    "the unit is expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the separation and @xmath47 is the orbital period of the binary ( see podsiadlowski , joss & hsu 1992 , hereafter pjh , for details ) .",
    "stable rlof usually results in a wide wd binary .",
    "some of the wide wd binaries may contain sdb stars if rlof occurs near the tip of the fgb .",
    "rlof near the tip of the fgb is not likely to be stable if one uses the polytropic criterion ( criterion i ) since @xmath10 is generally less than 1 and since we do not explicitly include tidally enhanced stellar winds @xcite .",
    "when using a larger value for @xmath10 , the number of systems experiencing stable rlof increases significantly . to some degree",
    "this is equivalent to including a tidally enhanced stellar wind .",
    "moreover , the full binary calculations presented in paper i demonstrate that a larger value of @xmath10 is the more appropriate one to use .",
    "these calculations gave a typical @xmath48 ( see table 3 of paper i ) , very different from what the polytropic model predicts .",
    "if rlof is dynamically unstable , a ce may be formed @xcite , and if the orbital energy deposited in the envelope can overcome its binding energy , the ce may be ejected . for the ce ejection criterion , we introduced two model parameters , @xmath49 for the common envelope ejection efficiency and @xmath50 for the thermal contribution to the binding energy of the envelope , which we write as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the orbital energy that is released , @xmath53 is the gravitational binding energy and @xmath54 is the thermal energy of the envelope . both @xmath53 and @xmath55",
    "are obtained from full stellar structure calculations ( see han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 , hereafter hpe , for details ; also see dewi & tauris 2000 ) instead of analytical approximations . ce ejection leads to the formation of a close wd binary and may give rise to the formation of a sdb star in a short - period system with a ms companion .    the wd binary formed from the first rlof phase",
    "continues to evolve , and the secondary may fill its roche lobe as a red giant .",
    "the system then experiences a second rlof phase .",
    "if the mass ratio at the onset of rlof is greater than the critical value @xmath10 given in table 3 of paper i , rlof is dynamically unstable , leading again to a ce phase .",
    "if the ce is ejected , a sdb star may be formed ( see   3.3 ) .",
    "the sdb binary has a short orbital period and a wd companion .",
    "however , rlof may be stable if the mass ratio is sufficiently small . in this case , we assume that the mass lost from the mass donor is all lost from the system , carrying away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the wd companion .",
    "stable rlof may then result in the formation of a sdb binary with a wd companion and a long orbital period ( typically @xmath56 ) .",
    "if the second rlof phase results in a ce phase and the ce is ejected , a double white dwarf system is formed @xcite .",
    "some of the double wd systems contain two helium wds .",
    "angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation may then cause the shrinking of the orbital separation until the less massive white dwarf starts to fill its roche lobe .",
    "this will lead to its dynamical disruption if @xmath57 or @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the mass of the donor ( i.e. the less massive wd ) and @xmath60 is the mass of the gainer @xcite .",
    "this is expected to always lead to a complete merger of the two white dwarfs .",
    "the merger can also produce a sdb star , but in this case the sdb star is a single object .",
    "if the lighter wd is not disrupted , rlof is stable and an am cvn system is formed .    in this paper , we do not include a tidally enhanced stellar wind explicitly as was done in han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and han ( 1998 )",
    ". instead we use a standard reimers wind formula ( reimers 1975 ) with @xmath61 @xcite which is included in our new stellar models .",
    "this is to keep the simulations as simple as possible , although the effects of a tidally enhanced wind can to some degree be implicitly included by using a larger value of @xmath10 .",
    "we also employ a standard magnetic braking law @xcite where appropriate ( see podsiadlowski , han & rappaport [ 2002 ] for details and further discussion ) .      to estimate the importance of each evolutionary channel for the production of sdb stars",
    ", we have performed a series of monte carlo simulations where we follow the evolution of a sample of a million binaries according to our grids of stellar models .",
    "in addition , the simulations require as input the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primary , the initial mass - ratio distribution and the distribution of initial orbital separations .",
    "\\(1 ) the sfr is taken to be constant over the last 15gyr .",
    "\\(2 ) a simple approximation to the imf of miller & scalo is used ; the primary mass is generated with the formula of eggleton , fitchett & tout , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "the adopted ranges of primary masses are 0.8 to @xmath64 .",
    "the studies by kroupa , tout & gilmore and zoccali et al .",
    "support this imf .",
    "\\(3 ) the mass - ratio distribution is quite controversial .",
    "we mainly take a constant mass - ratio distribution @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath36 . as an alternative mass - ratio distribution we also consider the case where both binary components are chosen randomly and independently from the same imf .",
    "\\(4 ) we assume that all stars are members of binary systems and that the distribution of separations is constant in @xmath66 ( @xmath46 is the separation ) for wide binaries and falls off smoothly at close separations : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "this distribution implies that there is an equal number of wide binary systems per logarithmic interval and that approximately 50 per cent of stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100yr .",
    "we use the observations of maxted et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) as our main data set to constrain the bps model .",
    "observationally , two parameters of sdb binaries can be measured accurately , the orbital period @xmath47 and the mass function @xmath72 which just depends on the radial velocity amplitude .",
    "the latter can be related to a minimum mass of the companion @xmath73 by choosing an inclination of @xmath74 and adopting a typical mass for the sdb star ( @xmath12 in the following ) . since the minimum companion mass is more closely related to the physical parameters of the system , we follow common convention and plot the distribution of both the observational data as well as our theoretical distributions in a @xmath73@xmath47 diagram . in figure  1",
    "the filled symbols show the distribution of the systems in the sample of maxted et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) , where we excluded systems with known ms companions .",
    "since the majority of the sdb stars with known companions have wd companions and since the orbital periods are less than 10d , this immediately suggests that the majority of sdb binaries in this sample formed through the second ce ejection channel ( the second stable rlof would only produce sdb binaries with long orbital periods , @xmath75d ) . note that the first ce ejection channel also contributes to the observational data set ( in this case , the companion is a main - sequence star instead of a white dwarf ) .    to illustrate how we can use this diagram as a diagnostic",
    ", we have constructed a theoretical distribution of systems assuming that all sdb binaries in our sample originate from the second ce ejection channel . for this purpose",
    "we use a simplified bps model where we adopt simple distributions for the systems before the second ce phase .",
    "specifically we assume here that the wd masses are uniformly distributed between 0.25 and @xmath76 and between 0.55 and @xmath77 , that the mass of the sdb star progenitor on the main sequence follows the imf of miller & scalo , and that the logarithm of the separation , @xmath78 , is uniformly distributed between 1 and 4 .",
    "we then determine the post - ce parameters of the systems using our bps code for chosen ce ejection parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we further assume that the normal directions of the orbital planes of the sdb stars are randomly distributed and take the mass of the sdb star to be @xmath12 , no matter what the actual mass in the simulation is , in order to get @xmath79 which can then be compared directly to the observational data set .",
    "in figure  [ p - mwd ] we plot the distribution of sdb stars resulting from this simulation , where the symbols indicate the wd masses in the simulation ( dots : @xmath80 , pluses : @xmath81 , circles : @xmath82 ) .",
    "it is apparent that this simulation maps out the observed range of the distribution reasonably well except for kpd 1930 + 2752 , which has a wd mass of @xmath83 ( i.e. is more massive than the white dwarfs in this simulation ) . in this particular simulation , the common - envelope ejection efficiency @xmath49 and the thermal contribution to the ce ejection @xmath50",
    "were taken to be 0.75 ( as in our best - fit model obtained in ",
    "we have also tested lower and higher values for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "as one may imagine , higher values extend the distribution further at long orbital periods and lower values limit the distribution towards shorter orbital periods .",
    "there is a small gap in the left part of the distribution .",
    "subdwarf b stars to the right of the gap are produced from systems where the zams mass of the progenitor is below the helium flash mass ( i.e. the first sub - channel ) , while sdb stars to the left had more massive zams progenitors ( see   3.3 ) .",
    "the helium flash mass for pop i is @xmath84 . to allow a better interpolation in this mass range ,",
    "our model grid includes models with masses very close to the helium flash mass with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "if the masses of the two sets were infinitesimally close to the helium flash mass , the gap would disappear . however , this region would still be less densely populated than neighbouring regions .    in order to understand the evolutionary history of these systems better",
    "it is more instructive to look at the distribution of the orbital separation @xmath46 and the mass of the progenitor of the sdb star , @xmath60 , for systems that become sdb binaries _ before _ the ce phase .",
    "figure  [ wdbinary ] shows this distribution for the systems shown in figure  1 , where the solid curves mark the boundary of the parameters space that leads to the formation of short - period sdb binaries . identifying their evolutionary past then becomes a question of what previous evolutionary paths will fill this particular region of parameter space .",
    "this depends particularly on whether the first mass - transfer phase , which leads to the formation of the white dwarf , is dynamically stable or unstable .    in figures",
    "[ not - ce ] and [ non - cons ] we plot the distributions of wd binaries after the first rlof phase where the first mass - transfer phase was unstable and stable , respectively ( these were obtained from bps simulations with our standard set of assumptions ; see   4.2 ) .    from figure  [ not - ce ]",
    "it becomes immediately clear that systems where the first mass - transfer phase is dynamically unstable and leads to a ce phase are not likely to be responsible for the production of wd binaries with the required parameters . for the case @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see case shown ) , only a few wd binaries populate the marked region in the @xmath46@xmath60 parameter plane .",
    "we have tested that for values @xmath89 and @xmath90 , no systems would satisfy this constraint . even in the most extreme case with @xmath91 and @xmath92 ,",
    "the maximum values physically allowed , the right part of the marked region ( with @xmath93 ) which is in fact the most important part , can not be populated .",
    "we can therefore safely conclude that the first rlof phase for the progenitors of short - period sdb stars is likely to have been stable .    in figure  [ non - cons ]",
    "we plot the wd binaries that result from a first stable rlof phase assuming that mass transfer is conservative ( i.e. @xmath43 ) and where we use @xmath40 in the stability criterion ( consistent with the results from paper i ) .",
    "the region of interest is now populated by two distinct groups of systems separated by a gap .",
    "the wd binaries in the upper - left corner are systems that experienced stable rlof in the hertzsprung gap while systems below the gap fill their roche lobe first on the fgb .",
    "this evolutionary path tends to produce low - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath94 , indicated as dots ) , so this can not explain the many more massive wds in figure  [ p - mwd ] .",
    "this implies that the first rlof phase can not be conservative , at least not as a rule .    in figure  [ a - rlof ]",
    "we show a similar distribution , but now assuming that the first rlof is non - conservative with @xmath95 and that the mass lost takes away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the system ( @xmath96 in the pjh formalism ) .",
    "the distribution fills the parameter space of interest reasonably well , and the wd masses are also widely distributed as required .",
    "we generally find that using lower values of @xmath97 , reduces the mass @xmath60 and shortens the orbital period .",
    "if @xmath42 is too small ( i.e. mass transfer is very non - conservative ) , the most important part of the parameter space , the lower - right part with @xmath98 , can not be filled .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath44 increases the angular - momentum loss per unit mass lost from the system .",
    "hence higher values of @xmath44 produce shorter orbital periods . again",
    "the lower - right part can not be filled for values of @xmath99 and larger . for @xmath100 , all the parts of the space are filled , but only with relatively low - mass wds ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we also tested some cases where the mass lost takes away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the mass donor or the mass gainer ( for @xmath102 , 0.50 and 0.25 , respectively ) . in these cases , all parts of the parameter space are filled , but only with low - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the main conclusion of these comparisons is that , in order to obtain a wide coverage of the parameter space that can lead to the formation of short - period sdb binaries , _ the first phase of mass transfer has to be non - conservative _ , where our best - choice parameters are @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "all of these results are , however , dependent on the metallicity of the population . to examine this",
    ", we carried out a similar set of tests for a typical thick - disc metallicity of @xmath22 .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in figures  [ pmwdz004 ] to [ a - rlofz4 ] .",

    "note also that the gk selection effect tends to remove all of the sdb binaries from the first stable rlof channel .",
    "our bps model requires a number of model parameters and input distributions .",
    "the parameters / distributions which we varied in the study are : @xmath10 , the critical mass ratio above which mass transfer is dynamically unstable on the fgb / agb , the mass - transfer efficiency @xmath42 , which defines the fraction of mass lost from the primary that is accreted by the gainer for systems experiencing stable rlof after the main - sequence phase , the specific angular momentum @xmath44 lost from the system / unit mass during stable rlof , the ce ejection efficiency @xmath49 and the thermal contribution factor @xmath50 in the ce ejection criterion , the initial mass - ratio distribution @xmath112 and the metallicity of the population .    as was shown in",
    "  5 , @xmath10 , @xmath42 and @xmath44 are strongly constrained by the @xmath113 - @xmath79 diagram of the observations by maxted et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) . in order to match the observed distribution ,",
    "the value for @xmath10 can not be taken from a simple polytropic model @xcite , even in a revised version taking non - conservative rlof into account @xcite , as such a @xmath10 would make a first phase of stable rlof very unlikely and would not produce wd binaries with the parameters required to explain the sample of maxted et al .",
    "completely conservative rlof ( @xmath43 ) or the assumption that the mass lost from the system takes away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the primary / secondary also can not explain the observations .",
    "this analysis favours values @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( in units of @xmath116 ) ; we adopted these value for all of our simulations .",
    "we investigated two values for @xmath10 , 1.2 and 1.5 .",
    "the higher value implies that the mass donor can be more massive and that the first stable rlof phase then results in wd binaries with more massive wd companions ( see figures  [ pm1 ] and  [ pm2 ] ) .",
    "obviously , a higher @xmath10 leads to fewer sdb stars from the first ce ejection channel , more from the first stable rlof channel and more from the second ce ejection channel . as a consequence , the birthrate of sdb binaries is increased significantly ( see table  [ birthrate ] ) ; however , the fraction of sdb binaries is not influenced significantly , as the merger rate also increases .",
    "an increase in @xmath49 and @xmath50 makes it easier to eject the ce and hence leads to a systematic increase in the post - ce orbital periods of sdb binaries from the first ce ejection and the second ce ejection ; it also leads to higher birthrates from these two channels , but decreases the rate from the merger channel ( since fewer systems will merge in the age of the galaxy ) .",
    "however , the binary fraction of sdb stars at the current epoch decreases .",
    "the reason is that the envelope of a star near the tip of the fgb for zams masses less than the helium flash mass @xmath19 is loosely bound and can be easily ejected for a wide range of these parameters .",
    "therefore the main effect of an increase in @xmath49 and @xmath50 is to increase the numbers of ce ejections for stars with zams masses greater than @xmath19 .",
    "as their envelopes are tightly bound and the sdb binaries formed this way have very short orbital periods , they merge soon after their formation . on the other hand ,",
    "the increase of @xmath49 and @xmath50 makes helium wd pairs with a low total mass more likely , and therefore the sdb stars from the merger channel generally have a lower mass .",
    "since the timescale for helium burning for a low - mass sdb star is significantly longer in this case , this leads to an increased contribution of sdb stars formed through the merger channel at the current epoch .",
    "as compared to the constant initial mass - ratio distribution , the distribution for uncorrelated component masses means that a star is more likely to have a low - mass companion .",
    "therefore this distribution leads to more sdb stars from the first ce ejection channel and greatly decreases the numbers of sdb stars from the first stable rlof , the second ce ejection and the merger channel .",
    "the overall result is that the binary fraction of sdb stars increases significantly by about 10 per cent .",
    "the evolutionary timescale for stars of a given mass is shorter for stars with a thick - disc metallicity @xmath22 than the corresponding timescale for pop i objects .",
    "this implies that stars of lower mass can evolve to become sdb star within the age of the galaxy .",
    "since these lower - mass stars are relatively more common , the numbers of sdb stars of a thick - disc population from all the channels would be larger than that of pop i for the same star - formation rate .",
    "the binary fraction of sdb stars at the current epoch is somewhat higher than for pop i. the reason is that sdb binaries from the ce ejection channels are more likely from low - mass fgb stars for a thick - disc population due to their shorter evolutionary timescales , and the orbital periods of those sdb binaries resulting from low - mass fgb stars are so long that they will not merge in the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "a higher wd mass is also more likely for sdb binaries for the thick - disc population from the second ce ejection channel ( see fig .  [ pm2 ] ) , as the core mass of a fgb / agb star is more likely to be massive and therefore the wd binary resulting from the first rlof is more likely to contain a massive wd .",
    "figure  [ period ] shows the distribution of orbital periods of sdb binaries at the current epoch for simulation sets 1 to 12 .",
    "the orbital period ranges from 0.5hr to 500d ( see also figure  [ p - chan ] ) .",
    "while the lower limit is essentially fixed by the condition that neither component fills its roche lobe and therefore mainly depends on the radii of both components , the upper limit is mainly determined by how much angular momentum is lost during the first stable rlof phase .",
    "some of the distributions , such as those in simulation sets 3 , 9 and 12 with high ce ejection efficiency , have three peaks .",
    "the leftmost peak comes from the second ce ejection channel where the donor s zams mass is greater than the helium flash mass @xmath19 . in this case",
    ", the envelope is tightly bound and the wd has to penetrate very deep before the envelope can be ejected , which leads to a very short orbital period of the sdb binary .",
    "the central peak contains systems from the first and the second ce ejection channels where the donor s zams mass is less than @xmath19 .",
    "the envelope is more loosely bound in this case , leading to a longer post - ce orbital period .",
    "the rightmost peak is due to sdb binaries from the first stable rlof channel , which always produces systems with long orbital periods .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that sdb binaries from the first ce ejection channel dominate for the simulations where the initial component masses are uncorrelated .",
    "note that in this case very few sdb binaries are formed in the first rlof channel since for uncorrelated masses the first mass - transfer phase is dynamically unstable in most cases .",
    "in figure  [ p - chan ] we present the distribution of orbital periods of sdb binaries at the current epoch from the different channels of simulation set 2 ( with @xmath35 , a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath41 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "sdb stars from the first ce ejection channel have orbital periods from 1.5hr to 40d , where the lower limit is again constrained by the radii of the ms companions and the upper limit depends strongly on the ce ejection efficiency @xmath49 and the thermal contribution @xmath50 to the ce ejection . in the extreme case ( @xmath118 ) , the upper limit can be as high as 400d .",
    "sdb stars from the first stable rlof channel have orbital periods from 15hr to 500d , and the orbital - period range is sensitive to the assumption concerning the systemic angular momentum loss during the first stable rlof phase .",
    "the distribution has two peaks .",
    "the left peak is caused by sdb stars that experience stable rlof in the hertzsprung gap where the donor s zams mass is larger than @xmath19 , while the right peak is dominated by systems undergoing stable rlof on the fgb .",
    "( note that the minimum mass of the helium remnant which will ignite helium in the core is @xmath119 for stars with a zams mass greater than @xmath19 ; this value depends , however , on the initial mass ratio ; see han , tout & eggleton 2000 for details . )",
    "the left peak is much smaller than the right peak since all the donors in this group have to be quite massive and hence for the adopted imf have a lower probability .",
    "in addition , their companions are likely to be massive as well in this simulation with a constant mass - ratio distribution and have a relatively short evolution time .",
    "for example , the lifetime of a pop i star with a zams mass of @xmath120 on the main sequence is @xmath121 and the lifetime of a @xmath122 star is @xmath123 .",
    "such lifetimes are comparable to the core - helium burning lifetime of low - mass sdb stars : e.g. the core - helium burning lifetime of a @xmath124 sdb star is @xmath125 .",
    "this has the consequence that the companion star will fill its roche lobe while the sdb star is still burning helium in the core and the system may then no longer have the appearance of a sdb binary ( i.e. be a helium - burning star with a _",
    "hydrogen - rich envelope ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a donor experiencing stable rlof on the fgb is likely to be less massive and both components will have longer evolutionary timescales and mass transfer will not occur while the sdb star is still in the helium core - burning phase .",
    "the second ce ejection channel produces sdb binaries with orbital periods from 0.5hr to 25d .",
    "the distribution has two parts , separated by a well - defined gap .",
    "the left part contains systems where the donor s zams mass is greater than @xmath19 , and the right part systems with zams donor masses less than @xmath19 .",
    "the gap is caused by the sharp drop of the radius at the tip of the fgb from stars with zams masses somewhat smaller than @xmath19 relative to stars with zams masses somewhat greater than @xmath19 ( see fig .  8 and table  1 of paper i ) .",
    "this sharp drop leads to a great decrease in the radius range for which a star can fill its roche lobe , eject the common envelope and is then able to ignite helium in the core .",
    "the right part has two peaks , caused by the bimodal distribution of the masses of the wd companions .",
    "note that the sdb stars from the first ce ejection channel fill in the gap because of the large range of masses for the ms companions .",
    "in contrast , sdb stars from the second ce ejection channel all have wd companions whose masses are restricted to a rather narrow range .",
    "the second stable rlof channel does not produce any sdb stars in this model since mass - transfer is dynamically unstable in all cases . to obtain systems from this channel requires a tidally enhanced stellar wind . as shown in paper i , sdb binaries produced from the second stable rlof phase would have orbital periods in the range of 400 to 1500d .",
    "figure  [ mass ] displays the distributions of the masses of sdb stars from all the simulation sets .",
    "the overall mass range is quite wide , ranging from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "the distribution does not depend much on the ce ejection efficiency ( @xmath49 ) or the thermal contribution to ce ejection ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the distribution is mainly determined by @xmath108 , the critical mass ratio for stable rlof on the fgb or the agb , and the initial mass - ratio distribution . as a matter of fact , the distribution is mainly controlled by the contribution of systems from the first stable rlof channel .",
    "when this contribution is large , as in simulation sets 1 , 2 and 3 ( @xmath41 and with a flat initial mass ratio distribution ) , the distribution is wide and flat ( 0.35 - @xmath128 in panel a ) .",
    "if the contribution is insignificant , as in simulation sets 4 , 5 and 6 ( @xmath41 and with an initial mass ratio distribution of uncorrelated component masses ) , the distribution is narrow and sharply peaked ( the peak at @xmath23 in panel b ) .",
    "figure  [ m - chan ] gives the distributions from different channels in simulation set 2 ( with @xmath35 , a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath41 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "the distribution for the 1st ce ejection channel has a sharp major peak at @xmath23 and a secondary peak at @xmath129 .",
    "the secondary peak is due to the fact that the stellar radius range for ce ejection near the tip of the fgb to produce sdb stars is wider for @xmath130 than for @xmath131 ( see table  1 in paper i ) ; as a consequence , ce ejection for stars around @xmath130 results in relatively low - mass sdb stars which have relatively long helium - burning lifetimes .",
    "the first stable rlof channel produces a plateau ( or broad peak ) in the distribution at low masses , and the distribution drops sharply near @xmath128 , as most systems experiencing stable rlof in the hertzsprung gap result in low - mass sdb stars , while the maximum mass is limited by the core mass at the tip of the fgb at which the helium flash or helium ignition occurs .",
    "the distribution for the 2nd ce ejection channel has three peaks , the small left one at @xmath27 represents systems with a zams donor mass greater than the helium flash mass .",
    "the central one and the right one are analogous to the two peaks in the first ce ejection channel . finally , the merger channel produces a relatively wide and flat distribution from 0.42 to @xmath132 .",
    "the orbital periods @xmath47 and the mass function , or equivalently the minimum component masses @xmath133 ( obtained from the mass function by assuming that the mass of the sdb star is @xmath12 and the inclination @xmath74 ) can be determined quite precisely from the observational data set of maxted et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) .",
    "therefore we choose our best model by mapping the theoretical distribution in the observational @xmath47 - @xmath133 diagram .",
    "a two - dimensional mapping of this type constrains the bps model much more severely than any one - dimensional distribution could .",

    "we include the gk selection effect , which is the major selection effect , in the plotting , but do not consider the strip selection effect as some of the observational data points are not affected by it , nor do we include the @xmath17 selection effect . in figures  [ pm1 ] and  [ pm2 ] , plus",
    "symbols represent sdb binaries with wd companions and crosses sdb binaries with ms companions ( or red - giant companions ) from the simulations .",
    "filled squares represent observed sdb binaries with wd companions , filled triangles observed sdb binaries with ms companions and filled circles observed sdb binaries of unknown companion type .",
    "visual inspection of these distributions shows that several of the simulations are in reasonable agreement with the observational distribution , where simulation set 2 ( with @xmath35 , a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath41 , @xmath117 ) provides the best overall fit .",
    "based on this comparison , we choose set 2 as our best - fit model .    even though the overall distribution in set 2 agrees quite well with the observed one ,",
    "the agreement is by no means perfect . the density of points near the sdb star kpd 1930 + 2752 ( the filled square at the top - left corner of panel 2 in figure  [ pm1 ] ) is quite low",
    "this may be due to the fact that kpd 1930 + 2752 was specially selected as a p - mode pulsating star .",
    "it was found by billres et al . in a search for pulsators of the ec 14026 variety @xcite and may therefore not be a very representative system .",
    "it is also quite possible , perhaps even likely , that the ce ejection efficiency is not constant for all systems as we assumed .",
    "a higher ce ejection efficiency for this system could explain it easily ( e.g. see panel 3 of figure  [ pm1 ] ) .",
    "simulation set 2 is quite similar to simulation set 8 , except that in the latter @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 . for a higher @xmath10 , the mass donor in the first rlof phase tends to be more massive , and therefore the first stable rlof phase is more likely to produce wd binaries with high wd masses .",
    "the sdb binaries from the second ce ejection channel therefore tend to have more massive wd companions ( compare panel 2 of fig .  [ pm1 ] with panel 8 of fig .",
    "[ pm2 ] ) . a value of @xmath10 of 1.5 is higher than the critical value for dynamical mass transfer obtained from actual binary evolution calculations ( see section 5.1 and table 3 in paper i ) and may be in indication for tidally enhanced mass transfer ( see the discussion in section 4.1 ) .",
    "it may also by caused by our rather simple treatment of the first stable rlof phase on the fgb / agb .",
    "we assume that the final wd mass is equal to the core mass of the donor at the onset of the rlof phase .",
    "however , the core mass increases somewhat during stable rlof ; thus the final wd mass depends on the duration of the mass - transfer phase which in turn is quite sensitive to @xmath97 @xcite , an effect that needs to be studied further .",
    "our best - fit model is mainly constrained by systems that experienced a ce phase , where in many cases the companion is a white dwarf . using our best fits ( simulations 2 and 8)",
    ", our bps model then makes more general predictions about the distribution of the properties of sdb binaries with ms companions . in figure  [ comp ]",
    "we present some of the characteristics of the secondaries in these systems : in the hrd ( panels a and d ) , in the @xmath135 ",
    "@xmath2 diagram ( panels b and e ) and the distributions of @xmath2 ( panels c and f ) , where the panels on the left represent simulation 2 ( with @xmath136 ) and on the right simulation 8 ( with @xmath137 ) . in the upper panels , dots represents systems from the first ce ejection channel and plus symbols from the first stable rlof channel .    in these panels",
    ", one can distinguish four groups of systems , most clearly seen in the middle panels , corresponding to four peaks in the @xmath2 distribution in the bottom panels .",
    "the systems formed through the first ce ejection channel ( dots ) tend to have secondaries of the latest spectral type ( f to m ) and have the shortest orbital periods . because the secondaries are significantly less massive than the initial ms mass of the sdb star ( due to the @xmath10 constraint ) , they are essentially unevolved and hence lie close to the zams in the hrd .",
    "indeed most of the secondaries have spectral type m ( see the ridge in the central panels and the right peak in the bottom panels ) . below an orbital period of @xmath138hr",
    "most and below @xmath139hr all sdb binaries from the first ce ejection channel have m dwarf companions , consistent with the fact that all of the 5 sdb binaries with known ms companions have m type secondaries ( see e.g. fig .  [ bestpm ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is simply that these very low - mass stars have to spiral much deeper into the envelope during the ce phase before enough orbital energy has been released to eject the envelope , leading to shorter post - ce orbital periods . above a period of @xmath138hr",
    "there is an increasing number of secondaries of earlier spectral type ( as early as f ) , even though the systems with m dwarf companions still dominate ( this is more prominent in simulation 2 with @xmath41 than simulation 8 with @xmath40 ) .",
    "the two groups of systems with the longest orbital periods , mainly with secondaries of spectral type a to k , are systems from the first stable rlof where mass transfer started on the fgb .",
    "the gap between these two groups is just due to the hertzsprung gap .",
    "the systems with secondaries of the earliest spectral type ( mainly a ) are also systems from the first stable rlof channel , but where mass transfer started when the progenitor of the sdb star was in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "since in our model the critical mass ratio for stable rlof is much larger for systems in the hertzsprung gap ( @xmath140 ) than for stars on the fgb ( @xmath141/1.5 ) , the companions in the former can accrete much more mass in the first stable mass - transfer phase , and hence the secondaries of the sdb stars tend to be more massive and of earlier spectral type . furthermore",
    "because of the larger added mass , they are rejuvenated to a larger degree and therefore are on average somewhat less evolved than secondaries that accreted from a fgb star ( causing the kink around spectral type a0 , most clearly seen in panel d ) .",
    "we note that the precise distributions of the secondaries in these diagrams are somewhat sensitive to the assumptions concerning the stable mass - transfer phase , in particular @xmath42 , @xmath44 , @xmath10 and the treatment of the rejuvenation in our simulations .",
    "for example , a lower value of @xmath42 would systematically move the distributions towards lower temperatures .",
    "the comparison of the panels on the left with those on the right illustrates how dramatically the number of sdb binaries with ms stars depends on @xmath10 . for @xmath41 ( left ) , these completely dominate the overall distribution ( see the large peak in panel c ) , while for @xmath40 ( right ) they only form a significant subset .",
    "this has the interesting implication that observations of such systems and the determination of their frequency relative to short - period systems could help constrain @xmath108 , or more generally the conditions for dynamical mass transfer and/or the importance of tidally enhanced stellar winds .",
    "the observed samples of sdb stars are strongly affected by selection effects .",
    "these are relatively well defined for the sample of maxted et al .  .",
    "figure  [ bestpm ] illustrates how the selection effects operate for this sample in the @xmath0 - @xmath133 diagram and similarly figures  [ besttg ] and [ besthrd ] show the corresponding effects for the distributions of sdb stars in the @xmath2 - @xmath3 diagram and the hrd , respectively ( all for simulation 2 , our best - fit model ) . for comparison , figures  [ tg - chan ] and [ hrd - chan ]",
    "show the distributions in the @xmath2 - @xmath3 diagram and the hrd for the different formation channels to illustrate how the selection effects determine the relative importance of the various channels in observed samples .",
    "the most important selection effect is the gk selection effect which we apply in the following way .",
    "if a sdb binary has a ms companion and the effective temperature of the companion is above 4000k or the companion is brighter than the sdb star , the system is excluded .",
    "all sdb binaries from the first stable rlof are removed in this way in panel ( b ) of figure  [ bestpm ] as the companions are too massive ( see panel a of figure  [ comp ] ) .",
    "the sdb binaries from the first ce ejection channel with ms companion masses larger than @xmath142 for pop i ( or @xmath128 for a thick - disc population ) are also removed .",
    "the strip effect selects mainly against sdb stars with masses significantly different from @xmath12 .",
    "this excludes a significant fraction of sdb stars formed through the merger channel since these tend to have fairly high masses .",
    "similarly , sdb stars which formed from ce ejection channels where their progenitor had a zams mass larger than the helium flash mass @xmath19 tend to produce sdb stars with small masses and are also likely to be removed by the strip selection criterion ( see panel c of fig .  [ bestpm ] ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath17 effect selects against sdb stars with long orbital periods and small companion masses . as all the sdb stars with known orbital periods have semi - amplitudes @xmath17 larger than 30kms@xmath18 , we therefore remove sdb binaries with @xmath17 lower than 30kms@xmath143 ( see panel d of fig .",
    "[ bestpm ] ) .",
    "since the gk effect only excludes sdb binaries , it decreases the binary fraction of sdb stars ( see table  [ percentage ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the strip selection effect removes both binary sdb stars and sdb stars from the merger channel .",
    "whether this increases or decreases the binary fraction relative to the consideration of the gk effect alone depends sensitively on the ce ejection parameters . for simulations with relatively low @xmath49 and @xmath144 , the orbital separations of the resulting helium wd pairs are relatively small leading to a larger merger rate .",
    "since the resulting single sdb stars tend to be relatively massive , they are mostly removed by the strip selection effect .    in our simulations",
    ", we did not consider any luminosity selection , as one might expect to be important in a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "figure  [ m - chan ] shows the distributions of the masses of sdb stars from various channels .",

    "the merger channel produces a large fraction of relatively massive sdb stars which one would be able to detect to larger distances in a magnitude - limited sample .    for reference and comparison",
    "we show in figures  [ bestp ] to [ semi - k ] the distributions of orbital period , the mass of the sdb star , mass ratio , mass function and radial - velocity semi - amplitude from all channels for our best - fit model ( simulation 2 ) and show how these distributions are affected by the selection effects .",
    "as table  1 shows , the predicted birthrate of pop i sdb stars from all channels is in the range @xmath145@xmath6 for the whole galaxy , where our best models ( simulations 2 and 8) give a rate of @xmath7 .",
    "the formation rate from the merger channel alone , which produces single sdb stars , is in the range of 0.003@xmath146 , somewhat lower than the estimate of tutukov & yungelson ( 1990 ) who obtained a rate of @xmath147 . by taking an effective galactic volume of @xmath148 @xcite ,",
    "this can be converted into an average birthrate per pc@xmath149 of @xmath150@xmath151 or @xmath152 for the best model .",
    "when convolved with the lifetime of the sdb phase , these rates imply a total number of sdb stars in the galaxy of @xmath153@xmath154 , or a space number density of 0.5@xmath155 , where our best estimates are @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively . including the gk selection effect",
    "reduces both the number and the density of selected sdb stars by about a factor of 2 . the inclusion of the strip selection effect further halves these numbers . for a thick - disc population",
    ", the birthrate and the total number of sdb stars would be higher than for pop i if we adopted similar model parameters for both populations ( in particular , using the same star - formation rate ) .",
    "heber estimated the birthrate of sdb stars to be @xmath158 and the space density to be @xmath159 .",
    "downes derived a space density of @xmath160 from observations , while bixler , bowyer & laget obtained a density of @xmath161 .",
    "most other studies gave similar values , although villeneuve et al .",
    ", using a much larger scale height , obtained a birthrate density and a space density which are by a factor of @xmath16210 lower than the previous estimates , although this would not affect the overall birthrate estimate .",
    "the observational estimates are in reasonable agreement with our theoretical estimates , in particular after selection effects have been taken into account .",
    "observationally , over half of the sdb stars are in binaries with ms / giant companions @xcite .",
    "the sdb stars with ms / giant companions constitute 6388 per cent in our simulations .",
    "more than two thirds of the sdb candidates of maxted et al .",
    "are binaries with short orbital periods . with the gk effect ,",
    "the sdb binaries with short orbital periods produced from our simulations constitute 4186 per cent of the observable population . in the observational data set of maxted et al . , 13 of 18 ( or 72 per cent )",
    "sdb binaries with known companion types have wd companions @xcite , although the majority of sdb stars in the sample are presently of unknown type .",
    "the relative number of systems with wd and ms secondaries will allow to further refine the bps model , in particular @xmath10 ; however , as we have shown , these numbers are strongly affected by the selection effects .",
    "figure  [ besttg ] displays a comparison of our best model ( simulation 2 ) with the observations of maxted et al .   in the @xmath2  @xmath3 diagram .",
    "the distribution of observed systems ( as indicated by large symbols ) matches the simulated one ( as indicated by dots ) quite well after the gk selection effect has been taken into account .",
    "pg 1051 + 501 and pg 1553 + 273 ( the two top diamonds ) may originate from the first stable rlof channel and may have relatively large hydrogen - rich envelopes ( see also panel b of figure  [ tg - chan ] ) . in the simulation , sdb stars from the ce ejection channels are assumed to have envelope masses between 0.0 and @xmath163 , sdb stars from stable rlof channels to have envelope masses between 0.0 and @xmath164 , and sdb stars from the merger channel to have envelope masses between 0.0 and @xmath165 .",
    "brown et al .   pointed out that the envelope composition can be changed dramatically ( e.g. from hydrogen - rich to helium - rich ) due to helium - flash - induced mixing between the interior and the envelope .",
    "the hydrogen mixed into the hot he - burning interior is burned rapidly and the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope can be reduced .",
    "such mixing is found for sdb stars evolving to steady core helium burning with hydrogen - rich envelopes of masses @xmath166 .",
    "the mixing may also occur in a binary model and have a small effect on envelope masses , while the assumption on envelope masses is rather ad hoc in the simulation .",
    "figure  [ besttgaj ] compares the observations of saffer et al . and aznar cuadrado & jeffery with the sdb stars from our best model ( as indicated by dots ) .",
    "filled circles show the position of observed sdb stars from saffer et al . , filled triangles and filled squares represent single and binary sdb stars , respectively , from the observation of aznar cuadrado & jeffery .",
    "the candidates of saffer et al .   were taken from the pg catalogue and therefore suffer from the gk selection effect , while the candidates of aznar cuadrado & jeffery were taken from the iue archive and are affected by uncertain selection effects .",
    "aznar cuadrado & jeffery used a grid of high - gravity helium - deficient model atmospheres @xcite to determine the atmospheric parameters .",
    "their grid has a spacing of 2000k in @xmath2 and a spacing of 0.5 dex in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 values of their measured sdb stars have only three discreet values : 5.0 , 5.5 and 6.0 . with these limitations in mind",
    ", we conclude that our simulations can reasonably explain their observations .",
    "the distribution of orbital periods of sdb binaries @xcite is explained reasonably well in figure  [ bestp ] after the various selection effects have been applied .",
    "however , the distribution also suggests that the observed sample may be missing some of the sdb binaries with relatively long orbital periods .",
    "the distribution of the masses of sdb stars from simulation set 2 ( the best - fit model ) is plotted in figure  [ bestm ] ; note in particular how narrow the mass distribution becomes once selection effects have been taken into account .",
    "this also implies that real intrinsic mass distribution of sdb stars should be much wider than the observed one .",
    "since it is difficult to measure the mass directly from observation , we also plot in figure  [ theta ] the distribution of @xmath4 ( where @xmath167 ) for the sdb stars from simulation set 2 and histograms for 68 sdb stars observed by saffer et al .",
    ", 15 sdb stars and 10 sdo stars observed by ulla & thejll .",
    "the quantity @xmath168 is approximately constant for sdb stars of a given mass ( since it is proportional to the mass  luminosity ratio ; greenstein & sargent 1974 , also see fig .  3 of paper i ) , and therefore the distribution of this quantity provides some information on the mass distribution .",
    "the distribution from simulation set 2 is consistent with that from saffer et al .",
    "after inclusion of the gk selection effect and taking into account the fact that some of the sdb stars from simulation set 2 are actually sdo stars .",
    "those sdo stars come from the merger channel and are massive and therefore have low values of @xmath168 .",
    "the mass - ratio distribution ( see figure  [ ratio ] ) has three peaks : the first peak is caused by sdb star from the first stable rlof channel , the second and the third are due to the bimodal distribution of wd masses in the second ce ejection channel .",
    "however , it is the mass function rather than the mass ratio that can be measured directly from observations .",
    "the observed mass function distribution ( see figure  [ massf ] ) is well explained after application of the gk selection effect .",
    "figure  [ semi - k ] gives the distributions of radial - velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath17 of sdb binaries .",
    "the comparison between the theoretical and the observed distributions suggests that some sdb stars with a low value of @xmath17 are missing in the observed samples .",
    "dcruz et al",
    ".   tried to understand the formation of sdb stars by employing and varying the reimers mass - loss formula near the tip of the fgb . in their picture , it was a stellar wind that peeled off the hydrogen envelope of a fgb star before helium ignition , which then occurred at much higher @xmath2 leading to the formation of a sdb star .",
    "they assumed a broad distribution in the reimers coefficient @xmath169 in order to explain the observations .",
    "the value of @xmath169 has to be 23 times larger in some stars to produce sdb stars than to produce normal horizontal - branch stars . at present",
    ", there is no theoretical justification for such a range of @xmath169 values for single stars . on the other hand",
    ", our model provides a natural way to produce sdb stars without tuning the reimers coefficient .",
    "binary interactions naturally expose the hydrogen - exhausted cores of fgb stars either by stable rlof or ce ejection .",
    "an enhanced wind , as required by dcruz et al .",
    ", may be possible in binary systems since the stellar wind may be tidally enhanced due to the proximity of a companion star @xcite .",
    "sdb stars produced in this way would be binaries with relatively long orbital periods .",
    "we have not included a tidally enhanced stellar wind since we did not want to introduce further uncertainties into the modelling .",
    "nevertheless , this channel certainly needs to be studied further even though the channel may ultimately turn out not to be very significant since it probably requires significant fine - tuning of the stellar wind parameters ( i.e. it requires a fairly narrow range of binary separations ) .",
    "webbink , iben & tutukov , tutukov & yungelson ( 1990 ) and iben et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have investigated in detail the merger channel for the formation of sdb stars .",
    "their most recent estimate ( iben et al .  1997 ) for the merger rate of helium wds in the galaxy is @xmath170 , which is quite similar to our estimate of 0.003@xmath171 .",
    "iben et al .   did not specifically examine whether the merger product would ignite helium and hence become a sdb star .",
    "nevertheless , their results are consistent with ours , since we found in our simulations that in fact most merger products of helium wd pairs ignite helium .",
    "han gave a birthrate of 0.002@xmath172 in his study on the formation of double degenerates .",
    "our new birthrate is slightly larger than his , mainly because we adopted a higher value for @xmath10 for the first stable rlof phase , which makes the second ce ejection channel more likely and ultimately increases the merger rate .",
    "the distribution of masses of helium wd mergers in the present paper ( see fig .  [ m - chan ] ) is similar to the distribution in figure  6 of han ( 1998 ) .",
    "mengel , norris & gross have modelled the conservative evolution of a binary system with initial masses of @xmath173 and @xmath174 for the primary and the secondary , respectively , for a composition with @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "they also found that there is a range of initial separations for which a sdb star is formed as a result of stable and conservative rlof . the sdb star formed in their calculations had a mass @xmath177 and an orbital period of @xmath178 .",
    "both the mass and the period fall inside the range of sdb stars from the first stable rlof channel in our simulations although we use higher metallicities and assume non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "in this paper we used the well - defined sample of sdb stars of maxted et al .   and",
    "morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) to calibrate our bps model .",
    "however , because of the design of the sample and various selection effects , it only comprises a subset of the whole population of sdb stars included in the bps model .",
    "hence our model can be used to make predictions about the wider population of sdb stars . extending the observational sample",
    "should then allow to test these predictions and to help refine some of the bps parameters that are presently not well constrained .",
    "as one can see from figures  [ besttg ] and [ tg - chan ] , there are a few observed sdb stars ( in fact sdo stars ) with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "their position in the @xmath181 ",
    "@xmath3 suggests that they are more massive than @xmath182 ( see fig .",
    "2d of paper i ) . since the gk selection effect tends to eliminate sdb stars from the first stable rlof channel , most of these are likely to be single sdb stars formed from the merger channel ( although one of them , pg0839 + 399 , is a binary with an orbital period of 5.622d ) .",
    "our model predicts that a large fraction , perhaps the majority of the intrinsic population of sdb stars have ms companions .",
    "in particular , figure  [ comp ] shows that sdb stars from the first stable rlof can have companions with a spectral type as early as b. the predicted numbers of sdb stars with b , a or f type companions in the galaxy at the current epoch are 0.69 , 2.4 , 0.89 million , respectively , for simulation set 2 ( our best - fit model with @xmath41 ) or 0.50 , 0.61 , 0.56 million for simulation set 8 ( with @xmath40 ) .",
    "the numbers of b , a , or f type stars in the galaxy at the current epoch are 34 , 314 , 1898 million , respectively , in our bps model .",
    "these numbers imply that 2.0 per cent of b type stars , 0.75 per cent of a type stars and 0.047 per cent of f type stars should have sdb companions , respectively , for simulation set 2 . for simulation set 8 ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are 1.4 per cent for b type stars , 0.19 per cent for a type stars and 0.030 per cent for f type stars .",
    "the main difference between simulation sets 2 and 8 is the value of @xmath108 ( 1.5 in set 2 and 1.2 in set 8) .",
    "these percentages demonstrate ( also see the discussion in section  7.5 ) that the percentage of a type stars with sdb companions is quite sensitive to @xmath10 , the critical mass ratio above which mass transfer is dynamically unstable on the fgb or agb ( the sensitivity is due to the fact that such systems have experienced stable rlof on the fgb ) .",
    "observations of a type stars with sdb companions may therefore help to constrain @xmath10 , a basic and important parameter in any bps model .",
    "in this paper we have presented a comprehensive bps study for the formation of sdb stars and investigated the importance of the various evolutionary channels that lead to the formation of sdb stars .",
    "we studied the roles of both the theoretical model parameters and the observational selection effects .",
    "we obtained birthrates for sdb stars of 0.014  0.063@xmath183 , a total number of sdb stars in the galaxy of 2.4  9.5 million and a sdb binary fraction of 76  89 per cent .",
    "the distribution of orbital periods ranges from 0.5  hr to 500  d , possibly with three peaks at @xmath184hr , @xmath185d and @xmath186d .",
    "the distribution of masses has a fairly wide range from @xmath187 to @xmath107 with a major peak near @xmath23 .    comparing our simulations to observed samples of sdb stars",
    ", we found a best - fit model that explains the observed distribution quite satisfactorily with very reasonable theoretical parameters .",
    "based on this best - fit model , we conclude :    1 .   the first rlof needs to be more stable for a wider range of parameters than is commonly assumed , either because of a higher critical mass ratio @xmath10 for the occurrence of dynamical mass transfer or a tidally enhanced stellar wind .",
    "this suggests that the criterion for stable rlof needs to be studied further .",
    "the first stable rlof is non - conservative , and the mass lost from the system carries away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system .",
    "3 .   in agreement with earlier studies",
    ", we find that the common - envelope ejection is a very efficient process , though the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 can not yet be precisely determined .",
    "our best model explains the observed properties of sdb stars quite satisfactorily ( in particular , the @xmath113  @xmath1 diagram , the @xmath2  @xmath3 diagram , the orbital period distribution , the @xmath4 distribution , the mass function distribution , the binary fraction of sdb stars , the birth rates , the space number densities etc . ) .",
    "our best - fit model predicts a much wider distribution of masses for sdb stars than is commonly assumed .",
    "it also predicts that some b , a and f type stars have sdb companions and that the percentage of a type stars with sdb companions can be used to constrain the critical mass ratio for stable rlof on the fgb .",

    "<S> we have carried out a detailed binary populations synthesis ( bps ) study of the formation of subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars and related objects ( sdo , sdob stars ) using the latest version of the bps code developed by han et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1994 , 1995a , 1995b , 1998 , 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically investigate the importance of the five main evolutionary channels in which the sdb stars form after one or two common - envelope ( ce ) phases , one or two phases of stable roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) or as the result of the merger of two helium white dwarfs ( wd ) ( see han et al.2002 , paper i ) . </S>",
    "<S> our best bps model can satisfactorily explain the main observational characteristics of sdb stars , in particular their distributions in the orbital period  minimum companion mass ( @xmath0 - @xmath1 ) diagram and in the effective temperature  surface gravity ( @xmath2 - @xmath3 ) diagram , their distributions of orbital period , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and mass function , their binary fraction and the fraction of sdb binaries with wd companions , their birthrates and their space density . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a galactic formation rate for sdb stars of 0.014@xmath6 with a best estimate of @xmath7 and a total number in the galaxy of 2.4@xmath8 with a best estimate of @xmath9 ; half of these may be missing in observational surveys due to selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic binary fraction is 76 to 89 percent , although the observed frequency may be substantially lower due to the selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first ce ejection channel , the first stable rlof channel and the merger channel are intrinsically the most important channels , although observational selection effects tend to increase the relative importance of the second ce ejection and merger channels . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict a distribution of masses for sdb stars that is wider than is commonly assumed and that some sdb stars have companions of spectral type as early as b. the percentage of a type stars with sdb companions can in principle be used to constrain some of the important parameters in the binary evolution model . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that ( a ) the first rlof phase needs to be more stable than is commonly assumed , either because the critical mass ratio @xmath10 for dynamical mass transfer is higher or because of tidally enhanced stellar wind mass loss ; ( b ) mass transfer in the first stable rlof phase is non - conservative , and the mass lost from the system takes away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system ; ( c ) common - envelope ejection is very efficient .    </S>",
