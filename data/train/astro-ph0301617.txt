    "recent developments in the observations of the magellanic clouds  optical monitoring campaigns ( such as ogle and macho ) , which provide astrometry and variability information for a large number of objects , and the observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , which provide excellent positional accuracy in x - rays",
    " opened previously unavailable windows for searches for quasars behind the clouds . as a result ,",
    "in recent months there was a large increase in the number of known quasars near and behind the lmc and smc ( geha et al .",
    "2003 ; dobrzycki et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .    in dobrzycki",
    "( 2002 ) we presented an approach to searches for such quasars based on matching of the serendipitous x - ray sources found by _",
    "chandra _ with the optical information from the ogle - ii database ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ; ebru et al .",
    "excellent source positions from _ chandra _ match very well with the ogle data , which typically have very good seeing and low source confusion .",
    "the method is perfectly suited for searches in the densest parts of the clouds , as it is very well shown by the quasars behind the lmc . while @xmath050 quasars are now known in the general direction of the lmc , only a handful of them are behind the dense parts of the lmc bar , and three of those are _",
    "chandra _ sources .",
    "the downside of the method is the fact that _ chandra _ performs pointed observations only and therefore provides sparse sky coverage .",
    "for example , at present there are only five _",
    "targets that coincide with the ogle fields in the lmc .    in this paper",
    ", we applied our method to the quasar search behind the small magellanic cloud .",
    "there are two _ chandra _ targets in the smc that coincide with the ogle fields , and both are very interesting .",
    "the first is ngc  346 , which was observed for 100  ks .",
    "the second is a _",
    "chandra _ calibration source , snr , which has so far been observed 83 times .",
    "however , the individual observations of the calibration source placed it at various off - axis angles on various acis ccd chips , making the x - ray data analysis complicated .",
    "quasars behind nearby galaxies , such as the clouds , are of great astrophysical interest .",
    "first , they can provide a fixed reference frame for the proper motion studies .",
    "second , they can provide background sources for the analysis of absorption in the foreground galaxy .",
    "last , but certainly not least , a hunt for x - ray quasars behind the magellanic clouds has a potential for a very interesting result . under favorable conditions ( x - ray bright and highly variable quasar )",
    "the scattering of x - rays on the dust particles in the lmc or smc could lead to a direct , geometrical measurement of the distance to the galaxy ( for discussion of the concepts involved see , e.g. , trmper & schnfelder 1973 ; paczyski 1991 ; klose 1994 ; predehl et al .",
    "2000 ; and references therein ) .",
    "from the _ chandra _ archive we retrieved all imaging ( i.e.  with no grating inserted ) observations which overlapped the ogle fields . we reduced and analyzed the x - ray data using tools available in the ciao 2.3 and sherpa software packages .",
    "we applied newest gain and aspect corrections to the event lists .",
    "we cleaned the electronic streaks in acis - s4 chip using destreak .",
    "we searched the data for serendipitous point sources using both wavdetect and celldetect source detection tools .",
    "searching for sources was straightforward in the case of the observation of ngc  346 .",
    "for it was more complicated .",
    "we concentrated on those observations for which the aim point and large part of the field of view overlapped the ogle fields .",
    "we ran detection tools on all individual observations , but also , whenever it was practical ( i.e.  when aim points were close enough  typically within 2 arcmin  so that the point spread function size was not dramatically varying from observation to observation ) we merged the individual observations in an attempt to improve the photon statistics , and ran detection tools on the merged data sets .",
    "however , merging was possible in only a handful of cases .",
    "we combined the outputs of all detect runs . as expected , this process led to several spurious sources and duplicate detections .",
    "we examined the resulting list of candidates and removed the obvious artifacts and reconciled multiple detections .",
    "_ chandra _ x - ray positions are typically accurate to better than 1 arcsec . for each x - ray source",
    ", we identified both the closest ogle object and the closest ogle variable .",
    "we used a conservative threshold of 5 arcsec for the position match .",
    "the resulting list contained 80 candidates in both fields .    to aid quasar candidate selection ,",
    "whenever the net number of source x - ray photons allowed it , we performed a quick spectral analysis , identifying sources with power - law intrinsic spectra and/or higher than typical absorption , which are primary candidates for being qsos .",
    "however , this was only used for prioritizing the follow - up observations and we did not exclude any objects based on this characteristics .",
    "the optical follow - up spectra were obtained on 2002 september 16 - 18 with the magellan baade 6.5-meter telescope .",
    "we used the ldss-2 imaging spectrograph , with the 1.03  arcsec slit and the 300  l / mm grism , yielding a nominal resolution of 13.3   .",
    "exposure times ranged from 120 to 600 seconds .",
    "all observations were carried out with the slit oriented in the east - west direction . additionally , we observed two spectrophotometric standards , ltt 1788 and ltt 7379 ( hamuy et al .  1992 ) . following each observation , a he - ne",
    "arc lamp spectrum was acquired for wavelength calibration purposes .",
    "spectra were reduced in the standard way using iraf .",
    "we identified five quasars among 39 observed candidates ; we show their optical spectra in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we will discuss the properties of the individual objects in detail in the following section .",
    "we note that only one of the new quasars , qso j005719.84722533.5 , was identified by ogle as a variable .",
    "this is a clear indication that the variability- and x - ray - based quasar selections should be considered as complementing one another .",
    "the efficiency of the method is similar to the one seen in the lmc ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "the other objects identified in the follow - up observations were primarily early type stars and x - ray binaries . we will present the analysis of those objects in a forthcoming paper .    on figure  [ fig : smcimage ]",
    "we show the locations of the new x - ray quasars , and the positions of the variability - selected quasars from geha et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and dobrzycki et al .",
    "we also show the locations of quasars known prior to 2002 .",
    "as it can be clearly seen , the methods proposed in the recent papers made a significant difference in both the coverage and the number of known objects . until mid-2002 , there were no known qsos behind the dense parts of the smc .",
    "variability - based techniques revealed twelve such quasars .",
    "this is still a rather low number , and with the identification of the x - ray qsos , the number of known quasars behind the dense parts of the smc has risen by more than 40% .",
    "this is a relatively bright ( @xmath1 ) quasar at @xmath2 .",
    "it is seen serendipitously at a large ( 17 arcmin ) off - axis angle in a 100  ks _ chandra_/acis observation ( obsid 1881 ) of ngc  346 done on 2001 may 15 . as luck would have it , the quasar happened to fall on the backside - illuminated ccd chip acis - s3 , which has better efficiency at low energies than the frontside - illuminated chips .",
    "it is the brightest x - ray quasar from the objects presented here .",
    "the event pileup is not a problem due to the large off - axis angle .",
    "even though the source is very far off - axis in the _ chandra _ observation , where the point spread function is very large , the x - ray and ogle positions agree remarkably well , to better than 1  arcsec .",
    "the quasar lies in the vicinity of a known , but previously unclassified x - ray source 2e  0055.6 - 7241 ( see table  [ tab : x ] ) .",
    "qso j005719.84722533.5 is the only object among the quasars presented here which is classified in ebru et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as variable .",
    "its @xmath3 light curve ( figure  [ fig:0057ogle ] ) clearly shows slow irregular variability with an amplitude of @xmath00.2  mag .",
    "however , this object failed two initial criteria for inclusion in the eyer ( 2002 ) variability - based analysis : it did not have @xmath4 photometry available and it was too red in the @xmath5 color . therefore ,",
    "it was not considered by eyer to be a quasar candidate .",
    "the x - ray observation yielded @xmath02800 source photons with @xmath6 kev , sufficient to establish basic x - ray properties of the quasar .",
    "we excluded photons with energies below 0.3  kev since there are large calibration uncertainties for soft x - rays .",
    "we extracted source and background spectra using dmextract .",
    "figure  [ fig:0057xspe ] shows the x - ray spectrum .",
    "significant absorption in low energies is clearly visible .",
    "we performed spectral fits with sherpa .",
    "we fitted the spectrum assuming the intrinsic quasar spectrum to be a power law and fixed galactic absorption towards the smc . the milky way absorbing column alone",
    "is not sufficient to explain the dip in the spectrum in the low energies , and additional source of absorption is needed .    in table",
    "[ tab : x ] we list fit results for two scenarios .",
    "first , we attributed the additional absorption to the smc material alone ( in all fits presented in this paper , we assumed the smc metallicity to be 20% solar ; russell & dopita 1990 , 1992 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : x ] we also list , for comparison , the smc hydrogen column density from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) 21 cm measurements by stanimirovi et al .",
    "the fit was satisfactory in this scenario , but one can see that the smc column density necessary to account for the x - ray absorption is ca .",
    "two times higher than the atca measurement . in principle , this is not an irreconcilable difference . the discrepancy can be reasonably explained by the fact that the atca measurements are effectively averaged over a spatial resolution element of 98 arcsec ( @xmath030 pc at the smc ) , while the x - ray absorption is probing a specific line of sight .",
    "it is well known that the distribution of hydrogen in the smc is very inhomogeneous ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1997 ; stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the difference between the atca and x - ray fit values for the absorbing column is not dramatically large . further uncertainly comes from the fact that it is possible that the assumed smc metallicity may not apply to this specific line of sight , which may affect the estimate of the x - ray absorbing column .",
    "thus it is in principle possible that the absorption is in fact caused only by the material in the smc .    in the second scenario",
    ", we fixed the smc absorbing column at the atca value and attributed the additional absorption to the material at quasar redshift , assumed to have solar abundances .",
    "this scenario gave a marginally better fit than the first case .",
    "the required quasar intrinsic absorption , @xmath7 @xmath8 , is in the moderate - to - high range , but well within the range seen among agn ( see , e.g. , malizia et al .",
    "1997 ; risaliti , elvis , & nicastro 2002 ) .",
    "both scenarios give virtually identical intrinsic spectral properties for the quasar .",
    "the spectrum appears to be rather typical ( e.g.mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ; fiore et al .",
    "1998 ; reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:0057xspe ] shows the x - ray spectrum and the model fits to the second scenario ; the difference between the fits in both scenarios is too small to be visible on the plot .",
    "we also considered a third scenario , in which both the smc and redshifted absorption column densities were allowed to vary , but the resulting improvement in the fit did not justify the additional degree of freedom .",
    "we need to add that it is , of course , possible that neither scenario is entirely correct and that there are additional absorbers on the line of sight to the quasar , possibly a strong associated absorber or an intervening damped ly-@xmath9 system ( see , e.g. , bechtold et al .",
    "this possibility can not be explored with the available data .",
    "the x - ray spectral fits were very good , but we note that there are some features seen in the fit residuals , suggesting that the spectrum may be more complex . in particular , we note that there is a small hump near @xmath10  kev , which is @xmath06.4  kev in the quasar rest frame , i.e.  just where one would expect to see the iron k@xmath9 line .",
    "we note , however , that adding a gaussian line to the modeled spectrum did not improve the fit .",
    "it is well established that quasars are often variable in x - rays on short timescales ( e.g.  mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ; fabian et al .",
    "qso j005719.84722533.5 is no exception ; it is variable at very high confidence level .",
    "we show its x - ray light curve in figure  [ fig:0057xlc ] ( we note that in this plot we included events with @xmath11  kev , since low energy calibration uncertainties are not relevant to this issue ) . during the ca .",
    "28 hours in which the quasar was continuously observed , its acis - s3 count rate varied by a factor of two ; we note that the background light curve shows no signs of variability during the observation .",
    "the characteristic timescale for x - ray variability is @xmath02.5  hours , again well within the typical range for quasars .",
    "as mentioned above , four of the quasars lie in the vicinity of the _ chandra _ calibration source , snr .",
    "this object has been repeatedly observed every few months during the course of the mission , giving a unique opportunity to study variability of the quasars in the timescales of the order of months ( see , e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; bauer et al .  2002 ; maoz et al .  2002",
    "; uttley et al .  2003 ) .",
    "neither of the quasars was classified by ogle as variable and were therefore not considered in the variability - based search for quasar candidates of eyer ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , post factum analysis of the ogle light curves ( figure  [ fig : e0102ogle ] ; the data were kindly provided to us by a.  udalski ) qualitatively suggests that at least some of them are in fact variable .    since in various",
    "chandra _ observations  was placed on various acis chips at various off - axis angles , it was a matter of coincidence whether any of the quasars happened to be in the field of view in any single observation , and which acis ccd chip it happened to be observed with . as a result ,",
    "the x - ray data for any of the objects is a mix of data taken at various off - axis angles at various readout chips and even various nodes within one chip .",
    "also , the sources were usually observed far off - axis , where the chandra s psf is large , which forced us to use large source regions , and we typically have a substantial number of background events in the source regions .",
    "in addition to that , the selection of background regions is severely constrained , in both spatial and temporal domains .",
    "the background counts had to be taken from regions with comparable responses to the source regions , excluding regions containing all known sources , and they had to be observation - specific .",
    "all those effects result in rather large uncertainties for derived source parameters , especially when temporal properties of the sources are analyzed .    for all quasars",
    ", we followed a similar procedure : we extracted data from source and background regions in all observations in which the quasar was in the field of view .",
    "we performed the spectral analysis using sherpa , simultaneously fitting a single model to all datasets .",
    "again , we excluded photons with energies below 0.3  kev , and we fitted the spectrum assuming the intrinsic quasar spectrum to be a power law , with fixed galactic absorption and additional absorption from the smc . in one case we also investigated the possibility that the absorbing material could be associated with the quasar .",
    "we note that the errors quoted in table  [ tab : x ] are formal uncertainties as determined from the spectral fits .",
    "however , in some cases there may be hard to quantify , systematic effects .",
    "in particular , the estimates of the absorbing column density may be affected by the fact that many of the _ chandra _ observations of our quasars were done with the frontside - illuminated acis ccd chips , which have low quantum efficiency in the energy range where absorption is primarily felt , below @xmath01  kev .",
    "we analyzed the long - timescale variability of the quasars by grouping the observations that occurred within few days from one another and performing individual spectral fits on those groups .",
    "the group selection was straightforward , since the calibration observations were always done in batches that were separated by several months .",
    "since the number of events in such groups was often small , we used a simplified procedure for spectral fits .",
    "we froze the spectral slope and absorbing column and allowed only the spectrum normalization amplitude to vary .",
    "notes about the individual objects follow .",
    "this is a @xmath12 quasar at @xmath13 .",
    "even though it has the noisiest optical spectrum of all objects presented here , its quasar nature seems certain .",
    "the spectrum contains two broad features , near 4580 and 7970   , identified as and h@xmath14 .",
    "there are no previously known x - ray sources in the vicinity of this object .",
    "this object was in the _ chandra_/acis field of view in 27 observations .",
    "it is , however , faint in x - rays .",
    "even though the combined exposure time for this object was 211.5 ksec , it yielded only 212 net photons with energies above 0.3 kev .",
    "this enabled only very limited x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "we fixed the x - ray spectral slope photon power law index to the canonical value of 1.7 and the smc absorption to the stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) value , @xmath15 @xmath16 , and we only allowed the spectrum normalization to vary .",
    "we list the results in table  [ tab : x ] .",
    "we would like to note that the observed spectrum contains relatively few soft photons , and that we get much better fit if we set the absorption column to values much higher than the value quoted above .",
    "it is , of course , possible that the intrinsic x - ray spectrum is harder than the assumed @xmath17 , which would allow for lower absorbing column .",
    "however , even for the photon index as low as 1.2 we get the best fit for the column density @xmath050%  higher than the atca value .",
    "this may indicate that there are other sources of absorption on the line of sight to the quasar .    not surprisingly , individual data points on the x - ray light curve have large uncertainties ( see figure  [ fig : e0102xlc ] ) , driven by low signal - to - noise ratio in individual observations .",
    "the quasar is clearly too faint to draw any far reaching conclusions , but we can qualitatively say that it shows no indication of variability .",
    "this is a @xmath18 quasar with @xmath19 .",
    "no x - ray sources were previously known in its vicinity .",
    "it was observed by _ chandra _ 36 times for the total of 278  ks , yielding 1166 source photons with @xmath6 kev .    in this particular case",
    "the x - ray dataset is not well suited for determination of the absorbing column , since vast majority ( 32 out of 36 ) of _ chandra _ observations of this quasar were done with the frontside - illuminated acis ccd chips .",
    "we thus fixed the smc absorbing column at the value from stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and only allowed the power law index and normalization to vary .",
    "the results of the x - ray spectral analysis are shown in table  [ tab : x ] .",
    "while still within the typical range , this quasar shows a somewhat steep x - ray spectrum .",
    "qso j010522.51715649.7 has the best long baseline time coverage of all the quasars in our sample . while its x - ray light curve ( fig .  [ fig : e0102xlc ] ) hints at variability in the 1 - 1.5 year timescales , with the amplitude variation of 30 - 40%",
    ", we note that this result is not highly significant .",
    "this @xmath20 quasar is the second brightest in x - rays of the quasars presented in this paper .",
    "it is however faint in the optical / near ir range ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the quasar entered the _",
    "chandra_/acis field of view in just ten observations , in four epochs , with the combined exposure time of @xmath075 ksec .",
    "the observations yielded 1160 source photons with @xmath6 kev .",

    "the smc absorbing column in the fit is in good agreement with the atca measurement ; the small discrepancy can be reasonably explained by the clumpiness of hydrogen content in the smc .",
    "we also attempted a fit with the smc column density fixed at the atca value allowing for intrinsic absorption at the quasar .",
    "since the result from the smc - only scenario is close to the atca value to begin with , the resulting quasar absorption is  not surprisingly  only weakly constrained .    since the object has been observed in x - rays in only four epochs",

    "the efficiency of our quasar detection method in the smc is comparable to the efficiency seen earlier in the lmc ( dobrzycki et al .",

    "only one of the five quasars was classified by ogle as a variable object .",
    "this is a clear confirmation of the fact that x - ray - based quasar searches are complimentary to variability - based searches ( eyer 2002 ; dobrzycki et al .  2003 ; geha et al .",

    "the quasars presented here show typical x - ray properties .",
