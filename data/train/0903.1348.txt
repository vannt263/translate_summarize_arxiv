    "the study of spirals starts with the ancient greeks .",
    "a _ logarithmic spiral _ is a special type of spiral discovered by ren descartes and later extensively investigated by jacob bernoulli who called it _",
    "spira mirabilis_. this curve has the property that the angle @xmath0 between its tangent and the radial direction at every point is constant .",
    "this is the reason for which it is often known as _",
    "equiangular spiral_. it can be described in polar coordinates @xmath1 by the equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive real constants with @xmath5 .",
    "of course , in the extreme cases , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the spiral becomes a circle of radius @xmath3 , respectively it tends to a straight line .",
    "why is this spiral miraculous ? due to its property that the size increases without altering the shape , one can expect to find it on different objects around us .",
    "indeed , let us mention here some phenomena where we may see curves that are close to be a logarithmic spiral : the approach of a hawk to its prey , the approach of an insect to a light source ( see @xcite ) , the arms of a spiral galaxy , the arms of the tropical cyclones , the nerves of the cornea , several biological structures , e.g. _ romanesco broccoli _",
    ", _ convallaria majalis _ , some spiral roses , sunflower heads , _ nautilus _ shells and so on .",
    "for this reason these curves are named also _",
    "growth spirals_. ( see for other details @xcite . )    a special kind of logarithmic spiral is the _ golden spiral _ , called often _ a symbol a harmony and beauty _ due to its straight connection with fibonacci numbers and certainly with the _ golden ratio _ @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that if we look around we see everyplace the _ divine proportion_. hence , it is not surprising the fact that the golden spirals appear in many fields such as design ( architecture , art , music , poetry ) , nature ( plants , animals , human , dna , population growth ) , cosmology , fractal structures , markets , theology and so on .",
    "let s take a look to its geometric property , namely the angle between the tangent direction in a point @xmath9 and the position vector @xmath10 is constant .    but how these curves appear in nature ?    for example , in biology , after many observations",
    ", the trajectory of some primitive animals , in the way they orient themselves by a pointlight source is assumed to be a spiral ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the mathematical model arising from practice is proposed to be a curve making constant angle with some directions .",
    "the study of these trajectories can be explained as follows .",
    "first case , when we deal with a planar motion , using basic notions of the geometry of plane curves , it is proved that the parametric equations for the trajectory of an insect flight are @xmath11 y(t)=ae^{t\\cot\\theta}\\sin t \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which is an equiangular spiral .",
    "( the light source is situated in the origin of an orthonormal frame and the starting point , at @xmath12 , is @xmath13 . )    secondly , for a spatial motion , the condition that the radius vector and the tangent direction make a constant angle yields an undetermined differential equation , so , further assumptions are needed .",
    "one of the supplementary restrictions is for example that in its flight the insect keeps a constant angle between the direction to the light and the direction up - down ( see @xcite ) . in this situation the curve one obtains",
    "is a _ conchospiral _ winding on a cone .",
    "a similar technique is used in @xcite , where two deterministic models for the flight of peregrine falcons and possible other raptors as they approach their prey are examined by using tools in differential geometry of curves .",
    "again , it is claimed that a certain angle is constant , namely the angle of sight between falcon and prey .",
    "see also other papers related to this topic , e.g. @xcite .",
    "another important problem comes from navigation : _ find the _ _ loxodromes _ _ of the sphere _ , namely those curves on @xmath14 making a constant angle @xmath0 with the meridians .",
    "let us mention here the name of the flemish geographer and cartographer gerardus mercator for his projection map strictly related to loxodromes .",
    "these curves are also known as _ rhumb lines _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we take the parametrization of the sphere given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] , one gets the equations of loxodromes @xmath18 .",
    "notice that @xmath19constant represents a meridian , while @xmath20constant is the equation of a parallel .",
    "an interesting property of these curves is that they project , under the stereographic projection , onto a logarithmic spiral .",
    "a more general notion is the _ slope line _ also called _ generalized helix _",
    "( see @xcite ) . recall that these curves are characterized by the property that the tangent lines make constant angle with a fixed direction . assuming that the torsion @xmath21 , other two conditions characterize ( independently ) a generalized helix @xmath22 , namely    1 .",
    "lines containing the principal normal @xmath23 and passing through @xmath24 are parallel to a fixed plane , or 2 .",
    "@xmath25 is constant , where @xmath26 is the curvature of @xmath22 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "a lot of other interesting applications of helices are briefly enumerated in @xcite ( e.g. dna double and collagen triple helix , helical staircases , helical structure in fractal geometry and so on ) .",
    "all these make authors to say that the _ helix is one of the most fascinated curves in science and nature . _    we pointed out so far that the curves making constant angle with the position vector are studied and have biological interpretation . as a consequence , a natural question , more or less pure geometrical ,",
    "is the following : _ find all surfaces in the euclidean space making a constant angle with the position vector .",
    "_ we like to believe that there exist such surfaces in nature due their spectacular forms .",
    "we call these surfaces _ constant slope surfaces_.    concerning surfaces in the 3-dimensional euclidean space making a constant angle with a fixed direction we notice that there exists a classification of them .",
    "we mention two recent papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the applications of constant angle surfaces in the theory of liquid crystals and of layered fluids were considered by p. cermelli and a.j . di scala in @xcite , and they used for their study of surfaces the hamilton - jacobi equation , correlating the surface and the direction field . in @xcite",
    "it is given another approach to classify all surfaces for which the unit normal makes a constant angle with a fixed direction . among them",
    "developable surfaces play an important role ( see @xcite ) .",
    "interesting applications of the usefulness of developable surfaces in architecture can be found in a very attractive paper of g. glaesner and f. gruber in @xcite .",
    "the study of constant angle surfaces was extended in different ambient spaces , e.g. in @xmath27 ( see @xcite ) and in @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath14 is the unit 2-dimensional sphere and @xmath29 is the hyperbolic plane . in higher dimensional euclidean space , hypersurfaces",
    "whose tangent space makes constant angle with a fixed direction are studied and a local description of how these hypersurfaces are constructed is given .",
    "they are called helix hypersurfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is a classification theorem for all those surfaces for which the normal direction in a point of the surface makes a constant angle with the position vector of that point .",
    "we find explicitly ( in theorem 1 ) the parametric equations which characterize these surface . roughly speaking",
    ", a constant slope surface can be constructed by using an arbitrary curve on the sphere @xmath14 and an equiangular spiral .",
    "more precisely , in any normal plane to the curve consider a logarithmic spiral of a certain constant angle .",
    "one obtains a kind of fibre bundle on the curve whose fibres are spirals .",
    "the structure of this article is the following : in _ preliminaries _ we formulate the problem and we obtain the structure equations by using formulas of gauss and weingarten . in section 3 the embedding equations for constant slope surfaces are obtained .",
    "moreover some representations of such surfaces are given in order to show their nice and interesting shapes .",
    "in _ conclusion _ we set the constant slope surfaces beside the other special surfaces .",
    "let us consider @xmath30 an isometric immersion of a manifold @xmath31 into a riemannian manifold @xmath32 with levi civita connection @xmath33 .",
    "recall the formulas of gauss and weingarten    @xmath34    @xmath35    for every @xmath36 and @xmath37 tangent to @xmath31 and for every @xmath38 normal to @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the levi civita connection on @xmath31 , @xmath40 is a symmetric @xmath41-tensor field taking values in the normal bundle and called _ the second fundamental form _ of @xmath31 , @xmath42 is the shape operator associated to @xmath38 also known as the weingarten operator corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath43 is the induced connection in the normal bundle of @xmath31 .",
    "we have @xmath44 , for al @xmath45 tangent to @xmath31 , and hence @xmath42 is a symmetric tensor field .",
    "now we consider an orientable surface @xmath46 in the euclidean space @xmath47 . for a generic point @xmath9 in @xmath48",
    "let us use the same notation , namely @xmath9 , also for its position vector .",
    "we study those surfaces @xmath46 in @xmath47 making a constant angle @xmath0 with @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath49 the euclidean metric on @xmath47 , by @xmath33 its flat connection and let @xmath50 be the restriction of @xmath49 to @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a constant .",
    "two particular cases , namely @xmath52 and @xmath6 will be treated separately .",
    "let @xmath38 be the unit normal to the surface @xmath46 and @xmath53 be the projection of @xmath9 on the tangent plane ( in @xmath9 ) at @xmath46 .",
    "then , we can decompose @xmath9 in the form @xmath54 denoting by @xmath55 the length of @xmath9 , one gets @xmath56 and hence @xmath57 .",
    "it follows @xmath58 , unitary and tangent to @xmath46 in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a unitary tangent vector ( in @xmath9 ) to @xmath46 and orthogonal to @xmath60 .",
    "we are able now to write @xmath61    for an arbitrary vector field @xmath36 in @xmath48 we have @xmath62    if @xmath36 is taken to be tangent to @xmath46 , a derivation in with respect to @xmath36 , combined with the relation above yield @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the real valued second fundamental form ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 is the weingarten operator on @xmath46 .    identifying the tangent and the normal parts respectively we obtain @xmath67 @xmath68    we plan to write the expression of the weingarten operator in terms of the local basis @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath70 one obtains @xmath71    thus , the relation becomes @xmath72 and hence one gets @xmath73 namely @xmath60 is a principal direction for the weingarten operator .    consequently , there exists also a smooth function @xmath74 on @xmath46 such that @xmath75 hence , the second fundamental form @xmath64 can be written as @xmath76 .",
    "[ prop:1 ] the levi civita connection on @xmath46 is given by @xmath77    considering @xmath78 ( respectively @xmath79 ) in and , and combining with one obtains @xmath80 ( respectively @xmath81 ) .",
    "the other two statements can be obtained immediately .",
    "let @xmath82 be an isometric immersion of the surface @xmath46 in the euclidean space from which we extract the origin .    as a consequence of the proposition [ prop:1 ] we have",
    "@xmath83=-\\frac { 1+\\mu\\lambda\\cos\\theta}{\\mu\\sin\\theta } ~ e_2 $ ] .",
    "hence , one can consider local coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 on @xmath46 such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 a smooth function on @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that @xmath88 should satisfy @xmath89    the schwarz equality @xmath90 yields @xmath91 consequently @xmath92 and @xmath93    moreover , from @xmath94 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath84 and using that @xmath95 and that the tangent part of the position vector @xmath96 is equal to @xmath97 , we obtain @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a real constant which can be taken zero after a translation of the parameter @xmath84 .",
    "so , we can write @xmath101 accordingly , the pde becomes @xmath102 denoting @xmath103 , the previous equation comes out @xmath104 by integration one gets @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a smooth function depending on the parameter @xmath85 . from here",
    "we directly have @xmath74 . in the sequel",
    ", we solve the differential equation obtaining @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a smooth function on @xmath46 depending on @xmath85 .",
    "we can state now the main result of this paper .",
    "[ th:1 ] let @xmath109 be an isometric immersion of a surface @xmath46 in the euclidean @xmath110-dimensional space .",
    "then @xmath46 is of constant slope if and only if either it is an open part of the euclidean @xmath111-sphere centered in the origin , or it can be parametrized by @xmath112 where @xmath0 is a constant ( angle ) different from @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 is a unit speed curve on the euclidean sphere @xmath14 .    (",
    "sufficiency ) as regards the sphere , it is clear that the position vector is normal to the surface .",
    "the angle is zero in this case .",
    "concerning the parametrization , let us prove now that it characterizes a constant slope surface in @xmath116 .",
    "first we have to compute @xmath117 and @xmath118 in order to determine the tangent plane to @xmath46 .",
    "hence    @xmath119    @xmath120 ,    where @xmath121 is the proportionality factor between @xmath122 and @xmath123 and it represents , up to sign , the geodesic curvature of the curve @xmath115 .",
    "the unit normal to @xmath46 is @xmath124 then , the angle between @xmath38 and the position @xmath96 is given by @xmath125 thus the sufficiency is proved .",
    "conversely , we start with the local coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the metric @xmath50 on @xmath46 and its levi civita connection @xmath39 . in order to determine the immersion @xmath126 , we have to exploit the formula of gauss .",
    "more precisely , we have first @xmath127 and hence @xmath128 then we know that the position vector decomposes as @xmath129 these two relations yield the following differential equation",
    "@xmath130 it follows that there exist two vectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 such that @xmath133 denote , for the sake of simplicity , by @xmath114 .",
    "computing @xmath134 one obtains @xmath135 for any @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 . as consequence there exist two unitary and orthogonal vectors , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , such that @xmath141 and @xmath142 . at this point",
    "the condition @xmath143 is satisfied .",
    "the immersion @xmath126 becomes @xmath144    from the orthogonality of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , one gets @xmath145 , for any @xmath85 .",
    "thus , due the fact that @xmath146 is orthogonal both to @xmath147 and to @xmath148 , it results to be collinear with the cross product @xmath149 .",
    "moreover we have @xmath150 a straightforward computation shows us that @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( see relations , ) .    in the sequel ,",
    "the equation @xmath153 furnishes no more information .",
    "let us make a change of parameter @xmath85 , namely suppose that @xmath154 .",
    "therefore @xmath147 can be thought of as a unit curve on the sphere @xmath14 and denote it by @xmath115 .",
    "consequently , @xmath155 . with these notations",
    "we have the statement of the theorem .",
    "let us notice that the last equation , namely @xmath156 gives no other conditions .",
    "it is interesting to mention separately the case @xmath157 , even that it derives from the general parametric equation of the surface .",
    "if this happens , the surface @xmath46 can be parametrized as @xmath158 which represents    * either the equation of a cone with the vertex in the origin , * or the equation of an open part of a plane passing through the origin .",
    "here @xmath115 represents , as before , a unit speed curve on the euclidean 2-sphere .    to end the proof the particular case @xmath52 has to be analyzed .",
    "case @xmath52 .",
    "then the position vector is normal to the surface .",
    "we have @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "it follows that @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath46 is an open part of the euclidean @xmath111-sphere .",
    "let us remark that the only flat constant slope surfaces are open parts of planes and cones , case in which the angle between the normal and the position vector is a right angle .",
    "similarly the only minimal constant slope surfaces in @xmath48 are open parts of planes .",
    "as we expected , the shape of these surfaces is quite interesting and we give some pictures made with matlab in order to have an idea of what they look like .",
    "let us point more attention to this picture ( but not necessary with @xmath162 ) , when @xmath163 .",
    "then @xmath164 for all @xmath85 and consequently the slope surface is parametrized by @xmath165 it is interesting to notice that the parametric line @xmath166 is an equiangular spiral in the @xmath167-plane and it is drawn in blue .",
    "the black line represents the parametric line @xmath168 ( for a given @xmath169 ) .    in the following",
    "we represent other two slope surfaces ( @xmath170 ) together with their parametric lines in a certain point .     +    and now , here we are the cone , a slope surface with the constant angle @xmath171 .",
    "one can see the spiral , as parametric line , degenerated into a straight line on the cone .",
    "surfaces for which the normal in a point makes constant angle with the position vector have nice shapes and they are interesting from the geometric point of view .",
    "the study of these surfaces is similar , on one hand , to that of the logarithmic spirals and generalized helices ( also known as slope lines ) and on the other hand , it is close related to the study of constant angle surfaces and spiral surfaces .",
    "these last ones were introduced at the end of the nineteenth century by maurice lvy @xcite .",
    "at least for their shapes , one can say that constant slope surfaces are one of the most fascinated surfaces in the euclidean 3-space .",
