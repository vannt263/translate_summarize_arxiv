    "it is widely believed that the superstring theory is the most promising candidate for the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the most attractive feature of the superstring theory is the existence of the target space duality ( t - duality )  @xcite .",
    "it is t - duality that implies the minimal length scale , i.e. the string length scale @xmath1 ( we take the unit @xmath2 throughout this paper ) .",
    "thus , there is a possibility to avoid the cosmological initial singularity in the superstring theory .",
    "another feature of the superstring theory is the presence of extra - dimensions .",
    "therefore , it is inevitable to study the higher - dimensional cosmology and explain how 4-dimensional large external space emerges .",
    "brandenberger and vafa proposed an interesting cosmological scenario  @xcite ( see also previous works @xcite ) .",
    "they argued the avoidance of the cosmological singularity due to t - duality and proposed a mechanism how only 3 spatial dimensions become large through the annihilation of winding modes ( see also @xcite concerning this point ) .",
    "recent developments of d - brane physics stimulates the study of string gas or brane gas scenario  @xcite .",
    "because this idea is so attractive , it is important to clarify the issue of moduli stabilization in this scenario .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reveal to what extent the moduli can be stabilized in the scenario of brandenberger and vafa .    historically , watson and brandenberger first demonstrated the stability of the radion but in their work the dilaton runs logarithmically  @xcite .",
    "the 4-dimensional effective action is also obtained and concluded neither the dilaton nor the radion can be stabilized except for 5-dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "the effects of inhomogeneous perturbations are investigated and it is shown that they do not affect the stability of the radion  @xcite . the importance of the massless string modes are recently recognized  @xcite .",
    "the effects of d - string gas is also studied  @xcite .",
    "however , all of the previous analysis are restricted to the special subspace of the moduli space and the role of t - duality has not been fully explored . in this paper",
    ", we investigate moduli stabilization in the string gas compactification generally with focusing on t - duality .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "we review t - duality in the low energy effective action of string theory . we also present a string gas model as the t - duality invariant matter . in sec.iii , we present the numerical calculations of the simplest case which show the stability of the radion and the dilaton . in sec.iv",
    ", we obtain the t - duality invariant 4-dimensional effective action and clarify why the dilaton is stabilized in our numerical results . in sec.v , using the 4-dimensional effective action , we show the stability of @xmath0 compactification .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "here , we would like to review t - duality in string theory with focusing on its relation to cosmology . in the low energy",
    "effective action of string theory , there exists the @xmath3 symmetry which includes the t - duality symmetry @xmath4 as a special case  @xcite . in the full string theory , @xmath3",
    "symmetry cease to exist .",
    "however , the t - duality symmetry @xmath4 remains .",
    "in fact , in the case of a string propagating in constant background fields , the t - duality symmetry @xmath4 exists in the mass spectrum of a quantum string . in the cosmological background",
    ", we do not know exact spectrum . here , we treat the gas of strings as test objects and take the metric in a self - consistent manner .",
    "it is usual to do so in cosmology .",
    "the bosonic part of the low energy effective action of the superstring theory takes the following form @xmath5   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the 10-dimensional metric with @xmath8 and the dilaton , respectively . here",
    ", we used the notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the field strength of the anti - symmetric tensor field @xmath11 .",
    "we also defined the 10-dimensional gravitational coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "we assume the 4-dimensions are selected by the brandenberger - vafa mechanism .",
    "hence , we consider the cosmological ansatz for the metric : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the metric of 4-dimensional external spacetime and @xmath15 is the metric of the internal 6-dimensional compact space . here , both metric are assumed to depend only on 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "this means the internal space is flat with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient to define shifted dilaton @xmath18 by @xmath19 now , we define the 6@xmath206 matrix @xmath21 in terms of the internal space components of the metric .",
    "we assume the anti - symmetric field @xmath11 exists only in the internal space defined by the 6@xmath206 matrix , @xmath22 depending only on 4-dimensional coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "then the action can be set into a more compact form by using the 12 @xmath20 12 matrix @xmath23 : @xmath24 which satisfies a symmetric matrix element of the pseudo- orthogonal @xmath3 group , since @xmath25 for any @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "here , @xmath28 consists of the unit 6-dimensional matrix @xmath29 , @xmath30 using the metric ( 2 ) and the variables ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the action can be written as @xmath31 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the coordinate volume of the internal space and @xmath33 is the 4-dimensional scalar curvature . here , @xmath34 represents @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the trace of the matrix .",

    "the special @xmath37 transformation represented by @xmath43 belongs to t - duality transformation . more explicitly eq .  ( [ odd ] )",
    "gives , @xmath44 when we set @xmath45 , this corresponds to an inversion of the internal space matrix , @xmath46 .",
    "so far , we have seen only the kinetic part .",
    "it is interesting to see if the potential energy for the moduli can be induced by the string gas .",
    "if yes , because of t - duality , one can expect the moduli in the internal space are stabilized at the self - dual point , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is the subject of the next subsection .",

    "this is because @xmath61 becomes a total derivative in ( [ sg ] ) . in the case of a closed string",
    ", the general solution can be written as a sum of the left - moving and the right - moving solutions : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 here , @xmath65 are the expansion coefficients which become the operators when quantized .",

    "the basic assumption made in string gas cosmology is the adiabaticity in the following sense .",
    "we assume the matter action can be represented by the action of the modes of the string theory on the torus with constant @xmath6 and @xmath11 replaced by functions of 4-dimensional coordinates as @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting action will be invariant under the t - duality transformation .",
    "let us imagine a gas of string consists of modes which become massless at the self - dual point .",
    "this is legitimate at low energy .",
    "the energy of a string can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the 3-dimensional external momentum .",

    "finally , the action for the string gas is given by @xmath92 it is not apparent this action leads the stability of moduli as expected . to grasp the feeling",
    ", we shall present the numerical results in the next section .",

    "this system has the symmetry under the t - duality transformation @xmath97 which guarantees the stability of the radion of the internal space . to confirm this ,",
    "we have solved the following equations numerically : @xmath98 where a dot denotes a t - derivative in this section and @xmath99 is the trace part of the energy momentum tensor of the string gas .",
    "we consider the string gas consists of the massless modes at the self dual point @xmath100 with @xmath101 which can be read off from eqs .",
    "( [ level ] ) and ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "thus , the pressure @xmath102 due to the string gas are given by @xmath103 the hamiltonian constraint @xmath104 is used to set the initial conditions . here , the energy density of the massless string is given by @xmath105    the results seen in fig.1 and fig.2 shows the stability of the radion and the dilaton .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the equation of motion for the dilaton ( [ dilaton ] ) as @xmath106 when the radion is stabilized due to t - duality , the last two terms vanish because the energy - momentum tensor of the string gas is traceless @xmath107 at the self - dual radius @xmath100 . in that case , the dilaton is stabilized due to the hubble damping .",
    "in order to understand the result of numerical calculation , we shall construct the t - duality invariant 4-dimensional effective action . in the previous effective action approach  @xcite ,",
    "as the shifted dilaton is not used , the procedure of the dimensional reduction is complicated . moreover , t - duality symmetry is not manifest .",
    "hence , we use the shifted dilaton and keep the t - duality symmetry manifest to circumvent these problems .    in order to see the stability of the moduli",
    ", we need to move on to the einstein frame . performing the conformal transformation , @xmath108 , to the action ( 7 ) ,",

    "suppose the moduli @xmath23 are stabilized at the self - dual point .",
    "as the mass of a string @xmath114 vanishes at the self - dual point by assumption , the potential of the shifted dilaton disappears .",
    "as there exists no potential , the hubble expansion prevents the shifted dilaton from running along the flat direction .",
    "thus , the shifted dilaton is marginally stable .",
    "then , the question is if the moduli @xmath23 are really stabilized or not . to investigate this issue",

    "the metric of the torus with unit volume is described by the metric @xmath116 where the periodic boundary conditions @xmath117 are assumed and @xmath118 denotes the absolute value of the complex number .     and @xmath28 .",

    "fortunately , as the internal space is the direct product of torus , it is enough to investigate the simple 6-dimensional spacetime with one torus as the internal space .",

    "( [ symmetry ] ) , it is easy to find the self - dual point @xmath133 one may expect this self - dual point is a stable minimum of the effective potential . in order to verify this , we should examine where is the minimum of @xmath134 in the potential in the action ( [ main - action ] ) .",
    "first , let us consider the string gas consisting of modes @xmath135 which becomes massless at the self - dual point . for this gas , we have @xmath136 in this case",
    ", there exists flat directions @xmath137 in contrast to the naive expectation .",
    "however , we only considered one kind of string gas which winds around one specific cycle .",
    "apparently , we have the other cycle for the torus . hence",
    ", we consider another string gas consisting of modes @xmath138 which becomes massless at the self - dual point . in this case , we obtain @xmath139 now , we also have flat directions @xmath140 .",
    "we find these two flat directions intersect at the self - dual point @xmath141 .",
    "hence , by taking into account both type of string gas , the self - dual point would be stable minimum .",
    "the stability can be explicitly verified by expanding the potential around this extrema as @xmath142 where we have used the fact that @xmath143 near the self - dual point .",
    "let us linearize the scale factor @xmath126 and the modulus @xmath28 as @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "other variables @xmath146 and @xmath128 are already linear because the background values of these variables are zero .",
    "hence , we have @xmath147 and @xmath148 here , we can see each potential has flat directions .",
    "however , by adding up both contributions , we get @xmath149 where flat directions disappear . thus , we have proved the stability of all of the moduli of the torus .",
    "even if we add other massless modes , the result does not change .",
    "the dilaton is also stabilized due to the reason explained in the previous section .",
    "this concludes the stability of @xmath119 compacification as we expected .",
    "we have analyzed the stability of @xmath0 compactification in the context of massless string gas cosmology .",
    "we emphasized the importance of the t - duality and massless modes in a string .",
    "we have first performed the numerical calculations and then shown the stability of the dilaton . to understand this numerical result",
    "we have constructed the 4-dimensional effective action by taking into account the t - duality .",
    "it turned out that the dilaton is marginally stable .",
    "we performed the stability analysis of the volume moduli , the shape moduli and the flux moduli .",
    "we have found that all of these moduli are stabilized at the self dual point in the moduli space .    of course , what we have shown is the stability of moduli during the string gas dominated stage .",
    "after the string gas dominated stage , the ordinally matter come to dominate the universe .",
    "then , the dilaton will start to run .",
    "therefore , we need to find a mechanism to stabilize the dilaton in these periods .",
    "one possibility is the non - perturbative string correction @xmath150   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken into accounts the loop corrections @xmath151 there may be a possibility to stabilize all of the moduli in the whole history of the universe in this context  @xcite .",
    "this possibility deserve further investigations .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the possibility to combine the string gas approach with other ones  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we need a mechanism to explain the present large scale structure of the universe in the context of the string gas scenario . in the string gas model , it is difficult to realize the inflationary scenario .",
