    "the problem of decoherence in mesoscopic systems has remained a central issue for two decades . with the possible advent of quantum computers , it now occupies an even more important role , as the limitations associated with various decoherence mechanisms provide the fundamental working limits of these devices .",
    "proposals for studying decoherence in aharonov ",
    "bohm ( ab ) type geometries have been made @xcite .",
    "experiments in the last decade have provided information on the phase shift suffered by an electron propagating through a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "these interference experiments show that coherent propagation through a dot is indeed possible .",
    "a few years ago , decoherence was introduced artificially in these same ab devices by placing a quantum point contact in the vicinity of the dot@xcite .",
    "alternatively , dephasing has been studied experimentally using a phase sensitive double dot detector @xcite . because quantum transport is a stochastic process , current noise or charge fluctuations act as a dissipative environment coupled to the dot , providing decoherence without particle transfer to this environment .    in the present work ,",
    "the decoherence rate is computed for the situation where the discrete level ( the dot ) is coupled electrostatically to the fluctuating charges of a normal metal  superconductor junction with an arbitrary bias . in the andreev regime , at zero temperature , it is expected that the calculation of the decoherence rate is similar to that of a normal metal point contact except that the charge of the carriers is replaced by the cooper pair charge@xcite .",
    "this simple analogy fails both at finite temperatures and at voltage biases superior to the superconducting gap .",
    "specifically , in both the andreev and the sub  gap regime , the decoherence rate depends crucially on the range of the potential which couples the dot to its environment : when this range is lowered below the fermi wavelength , oscillatory terms in the density  density correlator contribute substantially to the decoherence rate .",
    "even more stunning is the behavior of the decoherence rate as the voltage bias crosses the gap .",
    "the opening of new scattering channels accounts for an additional charge noise , and thus provokes a sharp increase in this rate . in principle",
    ", this could allow to tune the system from a `` quantum '' behavior to a `` classical '' behavior in a controllable manner .    the computation of the decoherence rate in the present work , which typically involves the calculation of a density  density correlator in the limit of zero frequency , uses as a starting point known results for the finite frequency current noise @xcite , rather than a direct computation of the density fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the charge fluctuations are directly connected to the current fluctuations using the continuity equation , which holds in second quantized notation , as will be shown below .",

    "a ( small ) quantum dot , which for practical purposes here is represented by a discrete , sharp energy level , is located in the proximity of a ( single channel ) normal metal  superconductor ( ns ) junction ( fig .",
    "[ ns_dot ] ) .",
    "the dot is connected to two semi  infinite leads , and can in principle be part of an interferometer such as the ones studied in refs.@xcite . the dot is coupled by coulomb forces to the fluctuating charges located in a ns point contact ( spc ) . to be specific",
    ", it is assumed that the electrostatic coupling is restricted to the normal side of the junction , as the dephasing mechanism is expected to be more efficient when the bias voltage on the ns wire is below the superconducting gap .",
    "the system is described by a hamiltonian which characterized the dot , the ns junction and the coupling between the two : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are fermion creation and annihilation operators in the ns junction and in the dot .",
    "the potential @xmath5 depends on the location of the charges in the ns junction .",
    "while it originates from long range coulomb forces , in practical situations it is screened by the surrounding metallic gates .",
    "later on , different ranges will be specified for @xmath5 in order to observe their consequence on the decoherence rate .",
    "the `` standard '' procedure@xcite for computing the decoherence rate @xmath6 is to identify an exponential decay in time of the dot electron greens function .",
    "even though there is no electron leak from the dot to the ns junction , the level in the dot acquires a finite width due to the coupling with the fluctuations in the junction .",

    "<S> the decoherence rate of a quantum dot coupled to a fluctuating environment described by a normal  metal superconductor junction is considered . the density  density correlator at low frequencies constitutes the kernel which enters the calculation of the phase coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> the density fluctuations are connected to the finite frequency current  current correlations in the point contact via the continuity equation . below and above the gap , at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> the density correlator contains spatial oscillations at half of the fermi wave length on the normal side . as the bias crosses the superconducting gap , the opening of new scattering channels enhances the decoherence rate dramatically , suggesting the possibility of tuning the decoherence rate in a controllable manner .    2 </S>"
