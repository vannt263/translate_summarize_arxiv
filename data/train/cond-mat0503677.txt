    "liquid metals are an outstanding example of systems combining great relevance in both industrial applications and basic science . on the one hand they find broad technological application ranging from the production of industrial coatings ( walls of refinery coker , drill pipe for oil search ) to medical equipments ( reconstructive devices , surgical blades ) or high performance sporting goods .",
    "most metallic materials , indeed , need to be refined in the molten state before being manufactured .",
    "on the other hand liquid metals , in particular the monoatomic ones , have been recognized since long to be the prototype of simple liquids , in the sense that they encompass most of the physical properties of real fluids without the complications which may be present in a particular system @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , metallic fluids such as molten sodium , having similar density and viscosity as water , find application as coolant in nuclear reactors .",
    "the thermodynamic description of liquid metals can be simplified by assuming a few parameters .",
    "usually , if compound formation is weak physical theory alone can be used while , if there is strong compound formation , chemical theory alone is used .",
    "the lowest - melting liquid metals are those that contain heavier elements , and this may be due to an increase in ease of creating a free - electron solution .",
    "alkali metals are characterized by low melting points , and they tend to follow trends .",
    "binary associating liquids show a sharp melting point , with the most noticeable example being mercury ( @xmath0 k ) .",
    "melting points can be lowered by introducing impurities into the metal .",
    "often , to this purpose , another metal with a low melting point is used . mixing different metals",
    "may often result in a solution that is eutectic .",
    "in other words , from henry s law it is understood that a melting point depression occurs , and the system becomes more disordered as a result of the perturbation to the lattice .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the well known eutectic pb - tin alloy , widely used in soldering applications ( @xmath1 k ) .    until the sixties the understanding of the physical properties of metals proceeded rather slowly .",
    "it was john ziman , indeed , who made the theory of liquid metals respectable for the first time @xcite , and the faber - ziman theory , developed in 1961 - 63 and dealing with electronic and transport properties , is attractively introduced in faber s book , which is an excellent treatise of the physical properties of liquid metals @xcite .    the other text which can be considered a classic is march s book @xcite , along with the more recent @xcite , which provides a comprehensive overview over liquid metals .",
    "it is from these texts that a first clear definition of liquid metal can be outlined . at first glance , indeed , the words `` liquid metal '' are self - explanatory : by definition any metal heated to its melting point can be cast in this category .",
    "liquid metals , however , are implicitly understood to be less general than the above definition , and no literature clearly states an exact definition .",
    "although no precise agreement has been made , there are certain characteristics shared by liquid metals , descending from a close interplay between ionic structure , electronic states and transport properties .    the book of shimoji @xcite deals with the fundamentals of liquid metals in an elementary way , covering the developments achieved after the first book by march .",
    "it does not address , however , the dynamical properties in great detail .",
    "addison s book @xcite is much like march s general book , but is more focused on applications of alkali metals , especially on their use in organic chemistry .",
    "in addition , addison discusses many methods for purifying and working with liquid alkali metals .",
    "march is more theoretical whereas addison is practical , but both authors focus on a thermodynamic explanation of liquid metals .    for an appealing general introduction to the physics and chemistry of the liquid - vapor phase transition ( beyond the scope of this review )",
    "the reader should certainly make reference to @xcite , which also provides a bird eye view of the practical applications of fluid metals , such as high - temperature working fluid or key ingredients for semiconductor manufacturing .",
    "there are , then , a number of books which are more general and more specific at the same time , in the sense that they deal with with the wider class of simple liquids ( including noble fluids , hard sphere fluids etc . ) , but they are mainly concerned with structural and dynamical properties only @xcite .",
    "they are practically ineludible for those aiming at a rigorous approach to the statistical mechanics description of the liquid state",
    ".    it can be difficult to find an exhaustive updated database of the physical properties of liquid metals , especially as far as dynamics is concerned .",
    "but the handbooks of @xcite and @xcite are remarkable exceptions , with the second one specifically addressing liquid alkali metals .",
    "early phenomenological approaches to the study of relaxation dynamic in fluids can be dated back to the end of the nineteen century @xcite .    only in the mid twentieth century , however , it was realized that a deeper understanding of the physical properties of liquids could have been reached only through a microscopic description of the atomic dynamics .",
    "this became possible through the achievements of statistical mechanics which provided the necessary tools , such as correlation functions , integral equations etc .",
    "the mathematical difficulties related to the treatment of real liquids brought to the general attention the importance of simple liquids , as systems endowed with the rich basic phenomenology of liquids but without the complications arising , for instance , by orientational and vibrational degrees of freedom .    as a consequence ,",
    "the end of the fifties saw major experimental efforts related to the development of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) facilities which , as we shall see , constitutes a privileged probe to access the microscopic dynamics in condensed matter and , in particular , in the liquid state @xcite .",
    "a sizable library of experimental data on liquid metals has been constituted since then , realizing the prototypical structural and dynamical properties of these systems , representative of the whole class of liquids .    in the sixties ,",
    "the advent and the broad diffusion of computational facilities brought a new era for two main reasons : on the one side , realistic computer simulation experiments become possible @xcite , on the other side the new computation capabilities greatly facilitated the interpretation of ins experiments .",
    "for instance , new protocols for accurate estimates of the multiple scattering contribution affecting neutron scattering were proposed @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework of the inelastic neutron scattering , and the guidelines to interpret the results , have been reviewed in the classical textbooks @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of liquid metals has been extensively investigated by ins and computer simulations with the main purpose of ascertaining the role of the mechanisms underlying both collective and single - particle motions at the microscopic level . in the special case of collective density fluctuations , after the seminal inelastic neutron scattering study by copley and rowe @xcite and the famous molecular dynamics simulation of rahman @xcite in liquid rubidium , the interest in performing more and more accurate experiments is continuously renewed : it was soon realized , indeed , that well - defined oscillatory modes could be supported even outside the strict hydrodynamic region . in molten alkali metals , moreover , this feature is found to persist down to wavelengths of one or two interparticle distances , making these systems excellent candidates to test the various theoretical approaches developed so far for the microdynamics of the liquid state .",
    "up to ten years ago the only experimental probe appropriate to access the atomic dynamics over the interparticle distance region were thermal neutrons , and using this probe fundamental results have been gained .",
    "there are , however , certain limitations of this technique which can restrict its applicability : first , the presence of an incoherent contribution to the total neutron scattering cross section . if on one hand this allow to gather a richer information , being simultaneously sensitive to collective and single particle dynamics , on the other hand poses the problem of decoupling the two contributions , when aiming at the determination of collective properties only ( i.e. of the coherent dynamic structure factor @xmath2 ) . in liquid sodium , for instance , the incoherent cross section dominates ; even in more favorable cases ( li , k ) at small @xmath3 the intensity of the collective contribution is low , and its extraction requires a detailed knowledge of the single particle dynamics .    the second reason is dictated by the need of satisfying both the energy and momentum conservation laws which define the @xmath4 region accessible to the probe @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "when the sound speed of the system exceeds the velocity of the probing neutrons ( @xmath5 m / s for thermal neutrons ) collective excitations can hardly be detected for @xmath3 values below , let s say , @xmath6 the position of the main diffraction peak of the sample , which is the region where collective properties show the richer phenomenology .",
    "as we shall see in section [ sec_klim ] , given a certain kinematic region accessible to neutrons ( basically ruled by their thermal energy ) , by virtue of the @xmath7 dependence of the sound velocity of an atomic system , the higher its atomic number , the wider is the accessible energy - momentum region of the excitations which can be studied .",
    "taking as an example alkali metals , indeed , accurate ins data are available for heavier elements such as rubidium ( @xmath8 m / s ) @xcite and cesium ( @xmath9 m / s ) @xcite , while more difficulties are met in the case of lighter atoms .",
    "in particular , lithium represents the most critical case due to its high sound speed ( @xmath10 m / s ) and to the weak scattering cross section which , moreover , results from comparable values of the coherent and incoherent contributions : for this reason ins aiming to the study of collective properties of li represented a very hard challenge @xcite . from a general point of view the main outcome of most of these early ins experiments , as far as collective properties are concerned , is the evidence of inelastic excitations in @xmath2 which have been necessarily analyzed within simple models such as the damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) @xcite , suitable to extract reliable and resolution - corrected information on the peak positions but not about the detail of the whole lineshape . some additional information have been achieved , for instance , in the case of cesium @xcite , where information about an average relaxation time have been extracted utilizing lovesey s viscoelastic model @xcite or , more recently , in molten potassium , where a generalized hydrodynamic treatment as the one described in sec .",
    "[ sec_collnonhydro ] is undertaken @xcite and electronic screening effects have been explicitly taken into account @xcite .    paralleling the development of ins facilities , new ideas arose on both theoretical and numerical fields from 1975 and in the intervening decades , driven by kinetic theory applied to enskog s fluid @xcite , allowing to describe the hydrodynamic region in terms of three pole approximation , or to reproduce the dynamic structure factor at wavelengths comparable to the inverse mean particle distance in terms of extended heat mode @xcite .",
    "kinetic approaches where eventually complemented by memory function formalism and by mode coupling theory @xcite .    turning the attention to numerical advances in the liquid metals field ,",
    "the major achievement are probably related to the introduction of the pseudo - potential concept @xcite which , beside offering a deeper comprehension of physical properties such as electrical resistivity , provided a clue for realistic numerical simulations . in molecular dynamics , indeed , the choice of a realistic interatomic potential - i.e. a potential model able to reproduce structural properties - is crucial to allow the determination of the dynamics of the system via the integration of the classical newton equations . exploiting the pseudo - potential theory , it has been possible to express the atomic interaction as a sum of pairwise interactions , ruled by an effective density dependent interaction . in this respect ,",
    "one of the most successful expressions is the effective potential proposed for alkali metals @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation framework is particularly useful since the single particle and the collective dynamics can easily be investigated within technical restrictions due to the finite box size ( defining the minimum accessible wavevector ) and computation time ( related to the statistical quality and to the energy resolution of the calculated spectra ) .",
    "broadly speaking the features of the atomic collective motion i.e. the details of @xmath2 lineshape , as outcome of md run , turns out to be less noisy and more straightforward than the correspondent ins results : no absolute normalization is required , no mixing between coherent / incoherent dynamics occurs and , above all , basically no resolution corrections are needed .",
    "the major experimental breakthrough , however , happened in the last ten years when x - rays came up by the side of neutrons to study the collective dynamics in a similar frequency and wavelength region .",
    "the intriguing theoretical possibility of performing inelastic x ray scattering @xcite became real thanks to the advent of the third generation sources @xcite , disclosing previously unaccessible tasks in the physics of disordered systems @xcite . in this case , the cross section is mainly coherent , and the combination of the two techniques can in principle serve to disentangle the two contributions .",
    "unfortunately , such complementarity has not yet been exploited at full .",
    "there are mainly two routes to approach the dynamics of a viscous melt .",
    "the first one stems from a quasi - crystalline picture , and relies on the observation that , often , the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 linearly depends on @xmath12 . the same dependence , in fact , is induced in crystalline solids by vacancies and defects .",
    "this analogy suggests that diffusion in liquids is an activated process , and many attempts have been done to relate the activation energy in the liquid to the thermodynamics of its solid .",
    "the other point of view is the kinetic theory , a gas - like picture where the correlation functions are different in view of the density which is typically much higher than in the gas state . within this framework",
    "an expression for the behavior of diffusion coefficient and viscosity can be gained in terms of the friction coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "when a particle of the melt is moving with constant velocity @xmath14 a net retarding force results from the different rate between front and back collisions of the form @xmath15 .",
    "for an hard sphere gas it turns out from fick s law of diffusion that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the atomic density , @xmath18 the atom mass , and @xmath19 the density probability of finding two units at distance @xmath20 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is therefore @xmath21 , while the viscosity @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these simple expressions turn out to describe remarkably well the dynamics of liquid metals as long as the one of other simple fluids .",
    "however , better quantitative agreement can be obtained introducing the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath23 , whose time integral determines the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the @xmath24 plays a central role in liquid dynamics , not only for providing a rigorous way to calculate @xmath11 , but also because through its fourier transform one can grasp an insight into the detail of the interatomic interactions .",
    "it can be accessed either by molecular simulations ( the calculation trivially follows from its definition ) or experimentally , mainly by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) with the methods detailed in section [ sec_exp ] .",
    "broadly speaking , @xmath25 is related to the knowledge of @xmath26 i.e. the probability that a given particle travels a distance @xmath27 in the time interval @xmath28 .",
    "ins is always sensitive to a combination of @xmath26 and @xmath29 , being this latter quantity the probability of finding two distinct particles at a space distance @xmath27 and time distance @xmath28 .",
    "the way to separate these two contributions mixed in the instrumental response is one of the major conundrum of the neutron scattering technique .",
    "the direct knowledge of the coherent response , gained by means of ixs , opens the possibility to the understanding of the high frequency modes that have been seen to survive since the famous ins experiments on the highly coherent scatterer liquid rubidium @xcite .",
    "in particular , from a solid point of view , the main issue is to ascertain the relation between these modes and the phonon excitations in the corresponding polycrystal just below the melting . in a perfect crystal ( i.e. a periodic assembly of atoms or ions ) , indeed , atomic dynamics is mainly vibrational , characterized by normal modes which are plane waves , due to the harmonic nature of the interatomic forces .",
    "consequently , a well defined ratio ( the sound velocity ) exists between the frequency and the wavevector of the density fluctuations , named in this case _",
    "phonon_. in real crystals , therefore , the energy spectrum of a scattered probe results in sharp peaks , whose linewidth is related to the presence of anharmonicities or lattice defects . in a liquid things",
    "are more involved : other effects arise besides anharmonicity , both structural ( the average atomic positions are randomly distributed ) and dynamical ( mass diffusion and activated processes join the purely vibrational motion ) .",
    "but even in this complex scenario distinct peaks survive and one can extract dispersion relations .",
    "interestingly , the relation between crystals and liquids involves more than the mere similarity between the sound velocity of the crystalline acoustic branches and of the mode observed in the liquid ( i.e. the low @xmath3 limit of the dispersion relation ) . despite the lack of periodicity intrinsic to the inherent liquid structure , indeed , the presence of some residual correlation ( testified by the oscillation in static structure factor ) seems to warrant a support for the existence of umklapp modes similar to the one existing in crystals .",
    "such processes , i.e. the presence of inelastic modes characterized by wavevectors which differ by multiples of the reciprocal lattice spacing , have been early reported by means of ins in liquid lead @xcite and more recently in liquid lithium by means of ixs @xcite . as correctly pointed out by faber",
    ", the presence of these excitations does not imply the existence of genuine high @xmath3 modes , it rather indicates that umklapp processes may occur in liquid as much as in solid @xcite .    from the liquid point of view",
    "the interest in this phenomenology lies in the challenging extension of the simple hydrodynamics , describing the density fluctuations in the long wavelenght limit , down to the lenghtscale of the mean interparticle distances .",
    "as it will be shown in the following , such an extension relies on serious and sometimes not fully justified assumptions necessary to walk in the uncharted and perilous territory between hydrodynamics and single particle regimes .      apparently at odds with the previously mentioned classification of liquid metals as prototype of simple liquids , even in the simplest monoatomic case , metallic fluids are actually two component systems .",
    "the interplay between electron and ions , indeed , is an intrinsic aspect of liquid metals , and a rigorous approach should therefore mimic the formalism utilized for binary mixtures . for many aspect ,",
    "however , one might be interested in ionic properties only , and as far as atomic dynamics is concerned , this seems to be the case . in such circumstance",
    ", one can look at a liquid metal as an ionic assembly whose interaction is mediated by the conduction electron gas .",
    "the treatment is in such way reduced to a one component system , like for noble fluids one can introduce a pairwise interaction , but this latter will be ruled by a density dependent pseudopotential .",
    "although within the pseudopotential approach many results for liquid metals are qualitatively similar to those for ordinary non conductive fluids , some remarkable differences exist .",
    "one of the most relevant of these differences concerns peculiar structural properties involving short range order : in several liquid metals the static structure factor exhibits an asymmetry or even a shoulder just above the main peak",
    ". the origin of this anomaly has been highly debated , and ascribed to the peculiar shape of the interaction potential in those metals in which the hard sphere description fails @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it can be interpreted in terms of a repulsive interaction composed by an hard sphere part plus an adjacent ledge induced by electronic effects , by a curvature change occurring at the nearest neighbor distance , or by the interplay with friedl oscillations .",
    "the reported peculiarities extend also to the dynamics : while in the long wavelength limit they are expected to behave similarly to non conductive fluids , at finite wavevectors their departure from ordinary hydrodynamics can be in principle influenced by the high values of the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking quantitative differences with ordinary fluids concerns the `` visibility '' of the inelastic features , i.e. the inelastic to elastic ratio , which seems to be related to the softness of the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "this latter is responsible , for example , for the very favorable inelastic to elastic ratio which makes alkali metals ideal systems to study collective properties .",
    "though the whole dynamics of liquid metals seems to be conveniently rationalized treating them as ordinary fluids interacting via an effective , density dependent , pairwise interaction potential , there is an alternative route which explicitly takes into account electronic screening effect on the ionic dynamics , relying on the introduction of a suitable model for the wavelength dependent dielectric function . in this way one",
    "his able to test different approximations comparing the predictions for the mechanical compressibility ( or , equivalently , for the sound velocity ) with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "as previously pointed out , some books offer a broad coverage of the physics and chemistry of liquid metals , but none of them is focused on the dynamical aspects . on the other side , books dealing with liquid dynamics do not spot on liquid metals in great detail .",
    "egelstaff s review @xcite offers an exhaustive coverage of transport phenomena in liquids but dynamical properties of liquid metals are marginally addressed .",
    "the copley and lovesey review @xcite provides an invaluable sight on the dynamics of simple liquids , and it presents many results obtained for liquid metals , but again does not emphasize the peculiarity of these systems .",
    "moreover , it also addresses in detail numerical results and last , but not least , it is necessarily not up to date given the large amount of experiments recently performed .",
    "the last decade , indeed , has seen important advances in the dynamics of liquid metals , especially on the experimental side , driven by the advent of new x - ray facilities and by the upgrades of the neutron ones . on the theoretical side , in the eighthes",
    ", impressive results have been achieved working on hard sphere models and/or mode coupling approaches which , again , remain uncovered in the copley and lovesey review . to conclude , it is certainly worth mentioning the more recent review article by p. verkerk @xcite , which offers a clear overview of the theoretical models developed sofar for liquid dynamics , presenting a selection of experimental results for liquified rare gases , molten metals and binary mixtures",
    ".    given this background , it seemed to us helpful to focus on the experiments on liquid metals , and to discuss and summarize the results and their interpretations in terms of the existing theories , trying to emphasizes advantages and weakness of each approach .",
    "this turned out to be a difficult task , given the broadness of the matter , and we necessarily had to make some choices .",
    "we left out , for instance , mixtures and alloys , and we tried to focus on the most recent experimental achievements , say of the last ten years : in most cases we quickly reference to older results , unless they are particularly relevant in view of the most recent ones .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section [ sec_bg ]",
    "we present different theoretical approaches to the dynamics of liquid metals .",
    "we develop in parallel subsections the treatment of the self and collective properties which are , in turn , organized according to the different wavelength domains : hydrodynamic , non - hydrodynamic , single particle .",
    "we also include a subsection dealing with hard sphere treatment and one presenting the ionic plasma approach , which is peculiar of conductive systems . in section [ sec_exp ]",
    "we describe the experimental approach to the investigation of microscopic dynamics in liquids , outlining the basics of the inelastic scattering problem .",
    "since the case of x rays is relatively newer , we decided to treat it in detail , but continuous reference is made to neutron scattering in an effort to emphasize merit , drawbacks and complementarities of the two methods .",
    "section [ sec_res ] is the bulk part of this paper , in which the experimental results are reviewed and ordered element by element . here",
    ", we make constant reference to section [ sec_bg ] to recall the different approaches utilized by different authors to describe the experimental result . in section [ sec_sum ] , finally , we try to summarize the arising scenario , pointing out the issues which , in our opinion , deserves further investigations and trying to draw , when possible , some conclusive pictures .",
    "the investigation of microscopic dynamics of an ensemble of @xmath30 identical atomic or molecular units usually proceeds through the study of correlation functions of dynamical variables , i.e. of functions of the phase space variables , defined as the @xmath31 positions @xmath32 and momenta @xmath33 of the particles .",
    "relevant dynamical variables are those stemming from the microscopic density @xmath34 ( whose average is related to the number density @xmath35 ) , momentum density @xmath36 and kinetic energy density e(*r*,t ) :    @xmath37    in many cases , the study of the dynamics of a tagged particle @xmath38 can be of interest , and it relies on similar definitions for the single particle dynamical variables :    @xmath39    the well known van hove distribution functions @xmath29 and @xmath26 are related in the classic ( not quantum ) case to the microscopic self and collective densities through :    @xmath40    with    @xmath41    as we shall see , experiments usually give information on the correlation functions in the reciprocal , @xmath3 , space .",
    "therefore , it can be useful to define the space fourier transform of the microscopic quantities previously introduced :    @xmath42    and similarly for the single particle variables .",
    "the time evolution of these microscopic variables is cross - linked and can be studied by replacing them with their average over small but statistically significant volumes .",
    "a closed set of equations , basically conservation laws and constitutive relations , can easily be written for these averages .",
    "once the expression for @xmath43 is known ( @xmath44 ) one can calculate    @xmath45    in which @xmath46 are the appropriate dynamical variables , and @xmath47 is the liouville operator ruling the time evolution in the configurational space .",
    "the @xmath48 indicates thermal averages evaluated over the @xmath30-particle ensemble ( from now on we will omit the subscript @xmath30 ) .    in particular , the autocorrelation functions of the microscopic density ( both self and collective ) play a privileged role , and we define , therefore :    @xmath49    consequently    @xmath50    the above autocorrelation functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are , in fact , connected through their time - fourier transform to the self and collective dynamic structure factor @xmath53 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these latter , in turn , are the experimentally accessible quantities in neutrons and x - rays inelastic scattering experiments and therefore , in the following , we will mainly refer to the density - density correlation functions .      before illustrating some models for the evolution of the density autocorrelation function , it is worth to recall here some basic relations involving the frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor",
    ". these can be very useful to the experimentalist , as a way to normalize the data ( an example is given in section [ sec_fetdq ] , as well as to any theoretical approach , as a direct test of sum rules - for example , we shall see how the hydrodynamic expression for the density - density time correlation function is valid up to the second frequency moment , because in hydrodynamics the liquid is treated as continuum without atomic structure , and such an information on structure and interatomic potentials appears only within the fourth and higher frequency moments of @xmath2 . by expanding the density autocorrelation function in a taylor series",
    ", one can easily find a connection with the frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor as :    @xmath54    this relation holds for the frequency moments of both the collective ( @xmath55 ) and the self ( @xmath56 ) dynamic structure factor . from the previous definitions",
    ", it easily follows that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first frequency momentum are , on the other side , @xmath59 and therefore are zero for any classical theory , characterized by symmetric spectral functions .",
    "the second frequency moments are @xmath60 .",
    "higher order spectral moments depend on the details of the microscopic interactions , and can be analytically derived for additive pairwise interatomic potential @xcite .",
    "some examples will be given in sections [ sec_mfs ] and [ sec_mf ] , while pratical usage of sum rules for normalization purposes will be outlined in section [ sec_fetdq ] .",
    "the models that we will illustrate in the next sections have been developed for a classical system .",
    "the main effect of quantum - mechanical corrections stems from the well - known inequality of the positive and negative - frequency parts of the spectra , connected by the detailed balance factor @xmath61 .",
    "additional sources of non - classical behavior , such as those associated with a finite value of the de broglie wavelength @xmath62 , are small ( for lithium at melting @xmath63  is only @xmath64 times the average interparticle distance , and this ratio decreases for heavier metals ) and can safely be neglected .",
    "since the effects of the detailed balance are clearly visible in the experimentally measured dynamic structure factors , we briefly discuss a possible procedure to account for this quantum feature in a consistent way , while preserving the inherent advantages of the classical description .",
    "in doing this , for the sake of clarity we shall denote all the previous classical quantities with the subscript _ cl _ , while the notation _ q _ will refer to the quantum case .",
    "the natural theoretical counterpart of the classical density correlation function is the so called kubo canonical relaxation function @xcite    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and the angular brackets denote now a quantum statistical average . in the classical limit ( @xmath67 @xmath68 ) the quantum operators become classical commuting dynamical variables and @xmath69 it can be shown @xcite that @xmath70 is a real even function of time , so that its spectrum @xmath71 is an even function of frequency . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental scattering cross section involves the fourier transform @xmath72 of the quantum density correlator @xmath73 the relation between @xmath72 and @xmath71 reads @xcite    @xmath74    and , as can be easily checked , satisfies the detailed balance condition .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the relation    @xmath75    connects the even frequency moments of @xmath76 with the odd ones of @xmath77 in addition to that , the same memory function framework which will be outlined in sections [ sec_mfs ] and [ sec_le ] can be phrased for the kubo relaxation function and for its laplace transform @xmath78 by virtue of all these properties , in a situation where the quantum aspects not associated with detailed balance are marginal , it is reasonable ( although not strictly rigorous ) to identify the spectrum @xmath71 with the classical quantity @xmath79 so that    @xmath80    having assumed such a correspondence , from now on we will drop out the subscript _ cl _ and refer to the classical quantities as in fact done at the beginning of this section .",
    "the transformation ( [ squantclass ] ) allows one to test classical models against experimental data .",
    "it is worth to point out , however , that it alters the frequency moments : as shown in the previous section , for instance , it introduces a @xmath81 correction to the second frequency moment , though this effect has been shown to be hardly noticeable in liquid metals @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the single particle density can be easily obtained through the continuity equation and the constitutive relation ( fick s law ) relating density and current variables :    @xmath82    it is worth to stress that while the first equation is exact , the second is a phenomenological `` closure '' . combining the two equations ,",
    "one gets the diffusion equation straightforward :    @xmath83    which , in the reciprocal space , has the solution    @xmath84    the normalized autocorrelation function of the single particle density is now obtained as    @xmath85    while its fourier transform , the self dynamic structure factor , will read    @xmath86    i.e. a lorenzian function centered at @xmath87 with fwhm equal to @xmath88 .",
    "it is worth to point out how , in the hydrodynamic limit , the diffusion coefficient is related to the dynamic structure factor as @xmath89 .",
    "finally , for completeness , the corresponding van - hove self correlation function is :    @xmath90      in a similar manner as in the previous section , one can build again a set of closed equations but , in this case , fick s law does not apply , and the situation is more involved .",
    "the constitutive relations , indeed , couple together the three conservation laws for the microscopic variables density , momentum and energy , which , in terms of the correspondent fluxes reads :    @xmath91    were we have defined the momentum flux @xmath92 and the energy flux @xmath93    @xmath94    here @xmath95 and @xmath13 are the shear and bulk viscosities , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the local pressure and temperature fields , @xmath98 is the enthalpy density and @xmath99 is the thermal conductivity .    two additional constitutive relations ( the navier stokes equation and the fourier law ) call into play the two additional thermodynamic variables pressure @xmath96 and temperature @xmath97 . invoking the thermal equilibrium and",

    "the reason for this apparent oddness can be traced back to arguments similar to the one applying to the case of gallium , i.e. to the freezing of the diffusional motion over the probed high frequency regime , which reduces the effective brillouin damping in respect to the hydrodynamic prediction of eq .",

    "these are ideal systems to challenge the validity extents of plasma - based theories introduced in section [ plasma ] , and the relative approximations for the dielectric function .",
    "models like the rpa , indeed , are expected to hold in systems with low @xmath663 ( or , equivalently , high electronic density ) such as bulk metals , while they reach their limits on increasing the @xmath663 value .    a second interesting aspect concerns the presence in liquid metals of the so called kohn anomaly , i.e. a kink in the dispersion curve occurring at @xmath664 and reflecting a singularity of the dielectric function which is observed in metallic crystals , but which is not yet established in the disordered phase .",

    "this coincidence generates an ambiguity in the interpretation of the observed dip in the sound dispersion , as it is not clear whether this feature is related to the structural periodicity as in non ordinary fluids or has to do with a purely electronic effect .",
    "the reported sound velocity values are intermediate between the one of the bare ions and the one appropriate for the li(nh@xmath561)@xmath668 vibrating network , though close to this latter . in a later study @xcite ,",
    "collective excitations are rationalized in terms of ionic plasma oscillations , and the sound velocity values measured at several metal concentrations are compared with the prediction of the bohm - staver expression of eq.([bs ] ) , taking as relevant mass either the bare ionic value or the metal - ammonia unit . in both cases",
    "the predictions do not agree with the measured values , and this seems to be a signature of the well known failure of the rpa approximation in the low - density regime , where the electron - electron interactions are relevant .",

    "an improvement is achieved accounting for both the finite ionic size and the electron - electron interactions .",

    "as far as the kohn anomaly is concerned , this study suggests that the value of @xmath669 ( @xmath621 nm@xmath277 in saturated lithium - ammonia solutions ) has to be compared with @xmath670nm@xmath277 , which is actually the second peak of @xmath272 , related to the @xmath671 periodicity , rather than with the first peak ( @xmath672nm@xmath277 ) related to the li(nh@xmath561)@xmath668 periodicity .",

    "the deviations , however , show a trend which monotonically decreases towards low @xmath663 elements and finally get negative for @xmath663 values close to 2 .",
    "a final remark concerns the choice of the dynamical variable to calculate the sound velocity when one is looking at subtle effects as in the present case .",
    "first , according to the hydrodynamic definition of sound velocity in liquids , one should look at the maxima of the current correlation spectra .",
    "while the difference with the maxima of @xmath2 is usually negligible in crystals , indeed , there can be a significant discrepancy in strongly overdamped cases such as the one metallic solutions . in this respect ,",
    "the choice of the dho to describe @xmath2 implicitly overcame this problem , as the characteristic frequency of this model coincides indeed with the maxima of @xmath615 .",
    "second , in all the reported studies , the `` phonon '' velocity is extracted through ad hoc models ( dho , extended hydrodynamic model etc . ) looking only at the genuine inelastic component .",
    "again , in liquids , the full @xmath615 spectrum should be considered , as when @xmath2 has a significant quasielastic contribution this latter can affect the peak positions of @xmath615 ( see , for instance , fig .",
    "( [ aldisp ] ) for the aluminum case ) .",
    "inelastic x - ray scattering , with lower energy resolution ( a few hundreds of @xmath678 ) and in a broader energy range ( up to a few ev ) , allows to study electronic excitations ( plasmons ) . in this case",
    "the plasma oscillation is brought about by free electrons , while the background is constituted by the ionic network .",
    "some recent studies @xcite point out a decrease of the plasmon dispersion at low metal concentrations , which , in turn , is ascribed to the failure of the rpa approximation .",
    "in this section we will try to summarize the scenario arising from the measurements reported so far . in respect to the collective properties",
    ", it seems useful to discuss the different dynamical regimes probed at different wavevectors and frequencies .",
    "although the two domains are in principle independent ( as testified , for instance , by the two separate generalization of the classical hydrodynamics introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec_collnonhydro ] ) , the existence of a dispersion relation ultimately allows one to think in terms of wavelenghts only . in our point of view , though precise boundaries can not be traced , one can identify in liquid metals the following dynamical regimes :    [ t ]     * the hydrodynamic , @xmath209 limit , that , in liquid metals , basically means @xmath679 nm@xmath277 . in this region",
    "simple hydrodynamic treatment based on three microscopic dynamical variables ( density , current , energy ) provides an exhaustive description of the main features .",
    "although not accessible by neutron and x - ray spectroscopic techniques , the hydrodynamic predictions are in very good agreement with acoustic measurements of sound velocity and attenuation properties .",
    "moreover , the strict analogy of long wavelength fluctuations in conductive and ordinary liquids ( accessible via light scattering ) corroborates the validity of the simple hydrodynamic theory .",
    "this region is characterized by _ adiabatic _",
    "sound propagation , and the whole dynamical features are ruled by macroscopic transport parameters ( viscosity , thermal diffusivity , specific heats ) . in this regime , other approaches tailored for conductive fluids such as plasma oscillation theories provides alternative descriptions , which turns out to be increasingly accurate for low @xmath663 systems . *",
    "an ( hypothetic ) isothermal region , which should be observable in the @xmath680 nm@xmath277 momentum range . upon increasing the wavevector outside the strict hydrodynamic limit , indeed",
    ", the lifetime of the entropy fluctuations becomes increasingly shorter ( @xmath681 ) .",
    "since the frequency of the corresponding density fluctuation increases almost linearly ( @xmath682 ) , one should expect a transition at @xmath683 .",
    "given the typical thermal diffusivity values of liquid metals this crossover should be located at a few fractions of nm@xmath277 . since with both ins and ixs one normally access momentum transfers above @xmath684 nm@xmath277 , this region can be hardly explored , and no direct and convincing indication for its existence are available at present",
    ". some old ins data on liquid lead @xcite as well as a more recent experiment on liquid nickel @xcite , however , seems to suggest indication for such existence .",
    "the case of nickel , in particular , is an interesting one and would deserve new investigations since in this system the specific heat ratio is particularly high and therefore the difference in sound velocities between an ordinary adiabatic regime and an isothermal one would be of the order of @xmath685 .",
    "it is worth to stress that the prediction for the existence of an isothermal regime poses on : i ) a negligible @xmath3 dependence of the thermodynamic quantities and ii ) the validity of a one component effective description in which the effective thermal diffusivity is well described by the sum of the electronic and ionic contributions .",
    "both this points have been recently discussed in the analysis of alkali metals and liquid aluminium ixs spectra @xcite . * a generalized hydrodynamic region , probed above @xmath393 nm@xmath277 , in which the frequency - wavevector dependence of the transport properties heavily affects the sound mode .",
    "the upper limit of validity of this region is rather system dependent , normally higher for alkali metals ( say up to @xmath686 ) .",
    "the natural framework is here the memory function formalism , which can be developed at different levels of accuracy , ranging from the celebrated lovesey s model @xcite ( accounting for a single average relaxation time for the second order memory function ) up to more refined memory function models based on multiple relaxation phenomena which , firstly introduced for lennard - jones systems @xcite , have been more recently adapted and tested against ixs investigations of liquid metals @xcite and numerical simulations of model undercooled and glassy alkali @xcite .",
    "+ in this respect , it is worth to point out how the high points of a memory function approach are not solely in a better agreement with experimental data , which , in general , heavily depends on the quality of the experimental data and , of course , on the number of the model parameters @xcite . in most cases , indeed , simplified phenomenological models such as the damped harmonic oscillator and a lorenzian function for the inelastic and quasielastic feature , respectively , provide satisfactory agreements .",
    "+ on the contrary , the memory function framework allows to grasp an insight behind the mechanisms ruling the relaxation dynamics , extracting relevant information about quantities which are not directly related to any spectral features , such as the @xmath3 dependencies of the relaxation time(s ) and of the longitudinal viscosity .",
    "+ [ h ]   + following the prescriptions illustrated in section [ sec_mf ] , indeed , the longitudinal viscosity is related to the total area under the viscous contribution to the memory function . in fig.([allvisco ] ) , for instance , we report the ( generalized ) longitudinal viscosities extracted in this way for several investigated systems . as can be seen , the low @xmath3 extrapolation of the experimental values compares well with independent acoustic determinations ( when available ) , but also allows to determined the @xmath3 generalization of this important transport properties , which can be directly estimated only by numerical simulations approaches .",
    "+ in this @xmath3 region , hard sphere - based theories provide alternative descriptions in terms of extended hydrodynamic models @xcite but they still miss a convincing explanation of one of the most important points : the physical interpretation beyond the relaxation of the sound mode , which is now a firmly established evidence supported by uncountable experimental investigations .",
    "+ [ h ]   + this latter aspect , which usually emerges in terms of a speed up of the sound velocity taking place in the @xmath687 nm@xmath277 region , is one of the most interesting aspects which is still lacking an explanation . broadly speaking ,",
    "it is always referred to as a shear relaxation , but the ultimate nature of the involved physical processes still have to be clarified .",
    "+ actually , mode coupling theory @xcite provides a description of the acoustic dispersion curve in terms of even powers of @xmath3 @xcite , but its interpretation is restricted to monoatomic systems in the liquid phase , while the observed phenomenology seems to be a more general feature of the disordered systems .",
    "+ interestingly , indeed , a qualitatively similar phenomenon ( see fig .",
    "[ pdisp1 ] ) has also been reported numerically in fused silica @xcite ) and experimentally in lennard jones fluids @xcite and hydrogen bonding systems ( @xcite ) . while in this latter case",
    "the positive dispersion has been shown to be an activated process , related to the structural relaxation , a different scenario seems to characterize the other systems .",
    "interestingly , indeed , ( see fig .",
    "[ pdisp2 ] ) the same behavior of the sound velocity also appear in _ glasses _ either in experimental ixs measurements in g - se and vitreous silica @xcite , in numerical works on model glasses of lennard jones systems @xcite , vitreous silica @xcite and alkali metals @xcite and , finally , in theoretical calculations for an hard sphere glass @xcite . in the case of alkali metals , in particular ,",
    "it has been shown how the speed up of the sound velocity persists upon cooling well below the glass transition , thus ruling out the possible role of the structural relaxation in this effect .",
    "the presence of positive dispersion at thz frequencies in glasses , quantitatively comparable to the one observed in liquids , therefore , challenges the interpretation of the positive dispersion in terms of a transition from a liquid like to a solid like behavior , an effect which seems to be quantitatively negligible ( with the remarkable exception of hydrogen bonding systems ) .",
    "accepting a description of the collective dynamics proceedings over two distinct viscous relaxations , therefore , the ultimate responsible for the bending up of the dispersion curve seems to be the faster of the two observed processes , which turns out to have a mild temperature dependence . in this respect ,",
    "the physical nature of this faster process calls for deeper understanding .",
    "it is worth to point out however , that in lennard jones systems the positive dispersion is recovered within an _ harmonic _ description of the dynamic structure factor in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , a result which relate the positive dispersion to the properties of the dynamical matrix and , ultimately , to the topological disorder of the inherent equilibrium position , being the interaction potentials comparable in glasses and crystals . + [ h ]   but in the glassy state @xcite and experimentally determined by means of ixs scattering @xcite . in both cases the transverse branch is also reported ; glassy selenium @xcite , again the sound velocity exceeds the adiabatic value.,title=\"fig : \" ] * a kinetic regime , valid from around @xmath577 , up to a few oscillations of the structure factor . here",
    "the hard sphere description provides remarkably accurate predictions , in terms of a quasielastic `` extended heat mode '' whose linewidth is described in terms of the enskog s diffusion coefficient and of an equivalent hard sphere diameter .",
    "the extent of validity of kinetic theory in this momentum range has been widely tested @xcite in several hard sphere - like systems ( like alkali metals and lennard - jones fluids ) , and it also apply in colloidal systems .",
    "it would be interesting to challenge such theory in less simple liquid metals . despite the success of hard sphere model",
    ", there is still an obscure point concerning the real origin of such extended heat mode : while in the low @xmath3 limit it tends to the entropy fluctuation mode , indeed , at finite @xmath3 s it certainly involves mass diffusion processes .",
    "looking at things from the constant energy point of view , umklapp modes resembling crystalline phonons in brillouin zones higher than the first seems to be still poorly understood @xcite . * an high @xmath3 region , probed as soon as the van hove distinct function vanishes . in this limit ,",
    "both ixs and ins experiments provide the same information , about the atomic motion over timescales shorter than the interparticle collision time . an almost exact description for this regime is available , which can also account for quantum aspects such as recoil energy an quantum corrections to the spectral moments .",
    "the single particle dynamics seems to be better understood if compared to the collective motion , at least by a coarse grained point of view of an hydrodynamic diffusive mode with finite @xmath3 corrections , evolving towards a ballistic regime .",
    "this is probably due to the intrinsic difficulty of isolating a ( wide enough ) constant @xmath3 _ coherent _ energy spectrum from an ins experiment .",
    "since the study of the strictly coherent spectrum became possible only in the last decade , indeed , a lot of efforts have been devoted in the past to the single particle case .",
    "though all the approaches described in this review describe , on average , equally well the available experimental data , a memory function formalism paralleling the one for the collective case could provide the route to relate the single particle motion and the collective dynamics in the microscopic regime .",
    "raising the level of detail of the description of the single particle dynamics , however , a major experimental challenge seems to be the identification of the different processes giving rise to the quasielastic incoherent scattering .",
    "recent ins results , indeed , suggest the presence of two distinct physical mechanisms , active over different timescales , underlying the diffusive motion @xcite .",
    "the combined presence of coherent and incoherent scattering , however , makes such identification still unclear although , in principle , the ixs signal might be used to subtract the coherent contribution from the ins spectra , thus extracting the purely incoherent dynamics . in this respect ,",
    "the synergy of combined ixs and ins studies on a same sample seems us imperative and could help to shed light on this point .",
