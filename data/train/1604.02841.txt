    "in 1973 , nambu proposed a generalization of the hamiltonian mechanics @xcite . in this dynamics , there appear multiple hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 governing the time evolution @xmath2 where @xmath3 is called the nambu bracket : @xmath4 just as the poisson bracket satisfies the jacobi identity , this bracket also satisfies an identity , which is now called the fundamental identity or the filippov identity .",
    "since the bracket was further generalized to those with @xmath5 entries , this algebra with three entries is called the three - algebra .",
    "recently , a proposal has been put forward to formulate the worldvolume theory of multiple m2-branes using the nambu bracket .",
    "this theory is called blg theory after its founders , bagger , lambert , and gustavsson @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review of the blg theory .",
    "it is surprising to see nambu s idea revived after three decades at the frontier of string theory .",
    "the blg theory is a 2 + 1d theory whose lagrangian is schematically @xmath6+[x , x , x]^2\\bigr ) + s_\\text{cs},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the chern - simons term is given by @xmath7 with the chern - simons level @xmath8 . using the fundamental identity of the nambu bracket , the gauge symmetry and",
    "the @xmath9 supersymmetry were proved @xcite . with the correct symmetry and matter contents ,",
    "it was expected that this theory would describe the worldvolume theory of m2-branes .",
    "m2-branes are the fundamental 2 + 1d excitations in m - theory , which is a 10 + 1d theory proposed to unify five perturbative vacua of string theory .",
    "however , it was found that the fundamental identity is very restrictive .",
    "in fact , if we require the algebra to be finite - dimensional , positive - definite , and completely antisymmetric , it can be proved that there is essentially only one algebra @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to our expectation of describing @xmath10 multiple m2-branes .",
    "so there were some trials to relax these requirements .",
    "in the meantime , it was gradually realized that multiple m2-branes can be described by the supersymmetric generalization of the chern - simons theory called abjm ( aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ) theory @xcite , following an early attempt in ref .",
    "in fact , among others , the free energy of this theory reproduces @xcite the @xmath11 behavior of the degrees of freedom of the m2-branes @xcite .",
    "this is strong nontrivial evidence for the theory .",
    "all of the studies on the supersymmetry , the large-@xmath10 behavior , and the moduli space indicate that the abjm theory in the infrared limit describes the multiple m2-brane system correctly .",
    "however , at the same time , it is known that for the flat case @xmath12 not all of the supersymmetries @xmath13 are realized explicitly .",
    "this leads us to expect that there may be room for improvement .",
    "here we shall make a trial in this direction . after reviewing the progress in the blg theory and the abjm theory",
    ", we shall turn to discuss a rather bold generalization by supersymmetrizing the three - algebra .",
    "this section is devoted to a review of the three - algebra mainly from the algebraic viewpoint .",
    "we shall start with lie algebra , which is defined as a linear space equipped with a binary operation @xmath14:{\\mathfrak g}\\times{\\mathfrak g}\\to{\\mathfrak g}$ ] , satisfying the following properties :    * antisymmetry , @xmath15=-[y , x]$ ] , * bilinearity , @xmath16=a[x , z]+b[y , z]$ ] , and * jacobi identity , @xmath17,z]+[[y , z],x]+[[z , x],y]=0 $ ] .",
    "note that the jacobi identity can be alternatively rewritten as @xmath18=[[z , x],y]+[x,[z , y ] ] , \\label{leibniz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which takes the same form as the leibniz rule , @xmath19 , if we regard the bracket product simultaneously as a derivative @xmath20 $ ] and a product @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "using the structure constant defined as the coefficient of the commutators , @xmath22=f^{ab}{}_ct^c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the jacobi identity can be recast into @xmath23 in the language of the structure constant . for a mnemonic reason ( and maybe a more profound one ) , we note that this identity can be regarded as the condition that the sum of the amplitudes in the @xmath24-channel , @xmath25-channel , and @xmath26-channel is vanishing ( see figure [ jacobi ] ) . if contracted with the killing metric @xmath27 , the structure constant @xmath28 is completely antisymmetric in exchanging the three indices .",
    "the nambu algebra is a natural generalization of the lie algebra .",
    "namely , it is the linear space equipped with a ternary operation @xmath29:{\\mathfrak g}\\times{\\mathfrak g}\\times{\\mathfrak g}\\to{\\mathfrak g}$ ] , which satisfies the fundamental identity , a natural generalization of , @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad=[[t^a , t^b , t^l],t^m , t^n ] + [ t^l,[t^a , t^b , t^m],t^n ] + [ t^l , t^m,[t^a , t^b , t^n]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well as the complete antisymmetry and trilinearity . in terms of the structure constants @xmath31=f^{abc}{}_dt^d,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the fundamental identity is given by @xmath32 as before , we give a pictorial representation of the fundamental identity in figure [ fundamental ] . using the fundamental identity of the nambu algebra , we can prove the gauge symmetry and the @xmath13 supersymmetry @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we expect that the m2-branes in m - theory are described by the blg theory .",
    "since we expect the rank of the gauge group to be identified with the number of m2-branes , we are interested in finite - dimensional algebras . however ,",
    "if we require conditions of finite dimension , complete antisymmetry , and positive - definite metric , it can be proved @xcite that the only nontrivial structure constant is @xmath33 the basic strategy in progress is to avoid these assumptions .",
    "one fundamental example with infinite dimension is , which is the original nambu bracket introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and was later interpreted as the m5-brane in refs .",
    "if we avoid the complete antisymmetry , this is nothing but the reformulation @xcite of the abjm theory @xcite that we will discuss later .",
    "another interesting possibility is to avoid the positive - definite killing metric @xcite , which leads to the so - called lorentzian blg theory .",
    "namely , besides the lie algebra generators , we add `` outer automorphism '' @xmath26 and `` center '' @xmath34 : @xmath35 and consider the algebra @xmath36=f^{ab}{}_ct^c,\\quad [ v , t^a , t^b]=0,\\quad [ t^a , t^b , t^c]=-f^{abc}v , \\label{uvlorentz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equipped with the lorentzian killing metric @xmath37 namely , the structure constant of the three - algebra is expressed in terms of that of the lie algebra as @xmath38 and the fundamental identity follows from the properties of the lie algebra . to avoid the quantum - mechanical instability coming from the negative norm ,",
    "a novel higgs mechanism was proposed @xcite by assigning a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the subsequent developments do not directly follow the idea of the nambu bracket .",
    "initiated by the idea @xcite of supersymmetrizing the 2 + 1d non - abelian chern - simons gauge theory , it was finally found that the system of @xmath10 coincident m2-branes on a geometry @xmath39 is described by the @xmath40 supersymmetric chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge group is u@xmath41u@xmath42 where the subscripts @xmath43 stand for the chern - simons levels . besides the gauge field in the adjoint representation ,",
    "we also need two pairs of bifundamental matters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "after various investigations , it turns out that the abjm theory is correct .",
    "this , however , does not directly mean that there is no room for improvement .",
    "for example , although the supersymmetry preserved by the m2-branes on the flat spacetime is @xmath13 , only @xmath40 is realized in the abjm theory .",
    "we shall look at the partition function and one - point functions of the half - bps wilson loop operator in the abjm theory more carefully for a possible clue .",
    "the partition function and one - point functions of the half - bps wilson loop on @xmath46 were calculated .",
    "using the localization technique , it was found that the expectation value originally defined by the infinite - dimensional path integral , @xmath47 } \\operatorname{tr}{\\text p}\\exp\\int a_\\mu dx^\\mu+\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] reduces to a finite - dimensional matrix integration @xcite , @xmath48 where the integrations are @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the character coming from the wilson loop in the representation @xmath51 .    if we look at the expression more carefully , it is not difficult to observe a deep relation to the supergroup u@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "namely , the character @xmath50 appearing after the localization of the wilson loop operator is nothing but that of the supergroup u@xmath52 ; the exponent appearing in the integrations , @xmath53 takes the form of the supertrace of u@xmath52 ; and the integration measure can be regarded as the hyperbolic deformation of the invariant measure of the supergroup u@xmath52 : @xmath54 all of this evidence indicates that the supergroup structure is hidden behind the theory .",
    "hence , on one hand , the blg theory is unsatisfactory because of its lack of examples of the three - algebra , while , on the other hand , the abjm theory does not realize all of the supersymmetries @xmath13 and the study of the partition function and one - point functions suggests a hidden supersymmetric gauge group . putting these considerations together , it is then interesting to ask whether we can take the idea of the super gauge group seriously by considering the supersymmetric generalization of the nambu algebra .",
    "namely , we try to take a stance that the hidden super gauge group u@xmath52 appears not accidentally after the localization but as a gauge group for the blg theory from the beginning .",
    "it is only after we partially fix the fermionic gauge symmetry that we end up with the conventional abjm theory with the bosonic gauge group u@xmath55u@xmath56 .",
    "it is known that in general the supergroup contains negative norms .",
    "typically , this is unacceptable in the path integral .",
    "however , in the novel higgs mechanism @xcite we have already accepted one negative component . here",
    "let us simply assume that the multi - components of negative norms are still harmless .",
    "in fact , in the matrix model the negative norms contribute as the fresnel integral instead of the gaussian integral . also , if we supersymmetrize the nambu bracket as a gauge group , it is important to understand the role of the chern - simons level @xmath8 in this theory",
    ". let us neglect these problems and proceed for now .",
    "it is important to come back to these problems in the future .",
    "we shall pose the question of whether it is possible to construct a nambu superalgebra respecting the symmetry u@xmath52 .",
    "namely , given the generators and the killing metric of u@xmath52 , we are interested in constructing a nambu superalgebra satisfying the fundamental identity and other properties .",
    "setup @xcite was done in refs .",
    "we are grateful to takuya matsumoto for pointing out these references to us . ]",
    "@xmath57    before proceeding to studying this question , we shall explain the superalgebra u@xmath52 and note that this algebra has a structure very similar to the lorentzian three - algebra .",
    "the superalgebra u@xmath52 contains two u@xmath56 factors as its bosonic subgroup , whose generators are denoted by @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 , and fermionic generators connecting the two u@xmath56 factors denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
