    "when we want to know the entire evolutionary history of a galaxy , its color and metallicity are important diagnostic quantities ( e.g. , tinsley @xcite ) . the evolution of the color and the metallicity results from the superposition of successive star formation during the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "thus , if we wish to reveal the evolution of galaxies , we always need to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) on a galaxy - wide scale .",
    "there are many methods to estimate the sfr of galaxies from observational quantities ( kennicutt @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we are especially interested in the conversion formula from infrared ( ir ) luminosity of the galaxies to their present sfr .",
    "the ir luminosity originates from dust that is heated by stellar radiation field .",

    "b ) , the dust - to - gas ratio is expressed as a function of metallicity ( see also dwek @xcite ; lisenfeld & ferrara @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we find easily that the relation between @xmath4 and sfr depends on metallicity via @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in this paper , we quantitatively examine the importance of the metallicity to our conversion law , the conclusion being that the metallicity dependence is not always negligible when we compare sfrs of very young galaxies and those of present galaxies .",

    "[ fig5 ] should be used instead after their metallicity is known .",
    "finally , we should keep in mind the possibility that far - ir ( fir ) or sub - mm sample of galaxies is biased to metal - enriched system because metal - poor ( i.e. , dust - poor ) galaxies are not easily observed in these wavelengths .",

    "this factor of 45 is larger than the uncertainty caused by the initial mass function of stars ( a factor of 2 ) .",
