    "green points stand for the stars for which they had no means to derived accurate stellar parameters , the results are thus considered as unreliable and must be taken with caution .",

    "indeed such stars present a rather condensed radiative helium core with a very large brunt - visl frequency which produces an important radiative damping .",
    "this radiative damping is so strong that no g - modes entering the core should be excited .",
    "however @xcite have shown that the presence of excited g - modes is indeed possible thanks to an intermediate convective zone ( icz ) which prevents some of the modes from entering the radiative damping core . in that case",
    ", the @xmath0-mechanism in the superficial layers can be sufficient to excite the modes .",
    "the presence of this icz is therefore crucial to have excited g - modes in supergiant stars .",
    "however massive stars are submitted to various complex phenomena such as rotation , strong mass loss , magnetic fields , semi - convection and overshooting .",
    "each of these phenomena exerts a significant effect on the evolution and some could prevent the formation of an icz",
    ". an enlightening and still widely used review on massive star evolution is to be found in @xcite while a more recent review has been made by @xcite .",
    "we shall here limit our discussion to slow rotators , slow enough to be able to ignore the additional mixing induced by rotation .",
    "magnetic fields will also be ignored .",
    "we shall here consider models on the main sequence ( ms ) or close to it and analyze the effect of mass loss and/or overshooting .",
    "mass loss induces a faster receding convective core during the ms phase @xcite .",
    "if a large enough mass loss rate is taken into account during the main sequence , no icz can be formed during the post - ms phase .",
    "overshooting will be discussed according to two different aspects : ( 1 ) overshooting during ms can prevent the formation of an icz during the supergiant phase ; ( 2 ) with a large amount of overshooting a star located in the supergiant region could still be on the ms , i.e. with a convective hydrogen - burning core . although the location of these stars in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) diagram could also be attributed to stars undergoing central helium - burning at the blue part of the he loop , we shall concentrate in this paper on the h burning phases : either the main sequence or the supergiant phase .",
    "the models were computed with the code ligeois devolution stellaire , cles @xcite .",
    "we used the opal opacities @xcite , completed with the @xcite opacities at low temperature .",
    "we adopted the ceff equation of state @xcite and the old standard heavy - element mixture ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) .",
    "boundary conditions at the surface are derived from a radiative gray model atmosphere computed in the eddington approximation and with the opal equation of state .",
    "the adiabatic oscillation frequencies are computed with losc @xcite and the excitation of oscillation modes is computed using the non - adiabatic code mad @xcite .",
    "b supergiant stars are post - ms massive stars which are burning hydrogen in a shell surrounding the helium core .",
    "some of them are already burning helium in the core .",
    "the he core is very dense and is contracting whereas the low density radiative envelope is expanding .",
    "the structure of the star in the vicinity of the hydrogen burning shell depends on the structure of the star during the ms .",
    "in particular , depending on this past history , an intermediate convective zone can develop above the core .",
    "the formation of the icz requires a region where the neutrality of temperature gradients is reached : @xmath9 during the ms phase .",
    "this region is formed by the decrease of the radiative and the adiabatic temperature gradient during the ms .",
    "the transformation of h into he decreases the opacity and thus the radiative temperature gradient which , in less massive stars , leads to a receding convective core .",
    "however the larger the initial mass , the higher the central temperature and massive stars have therefore a large radiation pressure which increases during ms .",
    "this results in a decrease of the adiabatic temperature gradient and the convective core either recedes much more slowly or even increases in mass during the ms .",
    "when this happens , a semi - convective zone appears , and adopting the schwarzschild criterion for convective stability , a partial mixing occurs in a region surrounding the convective core with a radiative temperature gradient very close to the adiabatic one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m16-gradx - article ] ) . in the post - ms phase ,",
    "when h - shell burning starts in this region , the radiative gradient becomes very rapidly larger than the adiabatic one since @xmath10 becomes very large ( @xmath11 ) and an intermediate convective zone appears in , or near , the h - burning shell .",
    "however that ms neutral region as well as the post - ms icz can be affected by various physical processes occurring during ms . if a large enough mass loss rate is taken into account during the ms phase , the central temperature increases less quickly .",
    "hence , the adiabatic gradient no longer decreases significantly .",
    "mass loss also results in a convective core receding more quickly and does not leave behind it a region where @xmath12 @xcite . therefore , with significant mass loss , no icz appears during the post - ms phase .",
    "overshooting during ms can also prevent the formation of an icz during the supergiant phase . finally , the criterion used to define the boundaries of the convective zones : schwarzschild @xmath13 or ledoux @xmath14 also affects the appearance or not of an icz @xcite .     on the ms phase",
    "the dotted line stands for the hydrogen abundance . during the ms both the radiative and the adiabatic gradients decrease and",
    "the region with the neutrality of gradients is formed.,width=245 ]      the structure of a supergiant star is similar to the one of a red giant : it is characterized by a high density contrast between the small size core and the expanding envelope .",
    "this problem has been discussed for giant stars by @xcite .",
    "the regions of mode trapping are shown in the propagation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propagation - diagram ] ) in which the dimensionless squared brunt - visl ( @xmath15 ) and lamb ( @xmath16 ) frequencies are plotted as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "we first consider a model without icz ( dotted line ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath18 is qualitatively similar from star to star , being infinite at the center and decreasing monotically towards the surface .",
    "this is not the case for the brunt - visl frequency : @xmath19\\\\ & \\simeq&\\frac{g^{2}\\rho}{p}\\bigg[\\nabla_{\\sf ad}-\\nabla+\\nabla_{\\mu}\\bigg ] \\,\\,\\textrm{for a fully ionized gas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is affected by the presence of convective region where @xmath20 is close to zero and by the mean molecular weight gradient , @xmath21 which leads to bumps in the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "moreover , the brunt - visl frequency depends on @xmath22 , which in supergiant stars , due to the contrast between the contracting helium core and the expanding envelope , takes huge values within the radiative core .",
    "hence the eigenmodes of any moderate frequency ( @xmath23 ) show a g - mode behaviour in the core , where @xmath24 : all non - radial modes are mixed modes .",
    "moreover , the eigenfunctions have a large wavenumber , @xmath25 , in the core since : @xmath26 in this radiative g - mode cavity , where oscillations present short wavelengths , a strong radiative damping always occurs . indeed , locally , the mechanical energy lost per unit length by the mode during each pulsation cycle due to radiative heat exchanges , is approximately given by : @xmath27 this expression will be detailed more rigorously in sect .",
    "[ sect : quasiad ] .",
    "it is obtained by substituting one of the dominating term in eq .",
    "[ diff ] ( last term ) into eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmai ] .",
    "this radiative damping of non - radial modes is thus very large due to the huge values of @xmath15 in the core , and it seems that there are no hopes to observe such modes in post - ms stars .",
    "however , in the reasoning above we have assumed that the eigenfunction square modulus @xmath28 is not negligible , which is not always the case due to the presence of an icz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propagation - diagram ] , solid line ) . in a convective zone @xmath29 and g - modes",
    "are evanescent .",
    "therefore , the icz can act as a potential barrier : some modes can cross it , others are reflected .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "the amplitudes of short wavelength oscillations are significant in the radiative core and strong radiative damping ensues ( see the gray line on the work integral , shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : workintegral ] ) : this mode can not be observed .",
    "the other mode , whose frequency is very close , is reflected on the convective barrier , i.e. has small amplitudes in the radiative core ( black line ) . in this case",
    "the radiative damping remains small compared to the @xmath0-mechanism occurring in the iron opacity bump near the surface ( see the increasing work at @xmath30 , black line on fig .  [",

    "_ in the dense spectrum of non - radial modes , some are reflected on the convective shell and can be excited and observed . _ in order to select the reflected modes , i.e. those with small amplitudes in the radiative core , we impose a rigid boundary condition at the base of the icz ( see sect",
    ".  [ section : nummethode ] ) .",
    "if the wavelength of the considered mode is a lot smaller than the width of the icz , this condition allows to achieve small amplitudes in the radiative core .",
    "it is useful to note that , if only reflected modes are considered , the mode propagation cavity exactly looks like a ms b star : because of the reflection , the radiative core can be somehow forgotten and the bottom of the cavity is a convective region . as a consequence ,",

    "the main numerical problem when solving the non - adiabatic pulsation equations in supergiant stars is the large number of mixed modes with a huge number of nodes . indeed , for a given period range , the number of nodes , @xmath42 , depends on the brunt - visl frequency : @xmath43 for a @xmath44 cephei type mode with a period of the order of the fundamental radial mode , the number of nodes is of the order of 100 , or even 1000 for spb type g - modes .",
    "the problem is numerical : it is difficult to solve the differential equations in such a cavity with so large a number of nodes .",
    "we shall however see that it is possible to avoid the computation of the full dense spectrum of non - radial modes by preselecting the modes that are reflected at the bottom of the icz ( and potentially excited ) .",
    "first of all , in order to select the reflected modes only , we impose a rigid boundary condition at the bottom of the convective shell : @xmath45 .",
    "this condition leads to small amplitudes of all eigenfunctions in the radiative core since @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath47 . as a consequence",

    "this condition allows us to solve the envelope problem individually , without taking care of what is happening below .",
    "all the computations are performed with the standard fully non - adiabatic code . artificially imposing a boundary condition inside the star",
    "will of course not provide the real frequencies of the full star .",
    "but as the frequency spectrum of the full star is very dense , there always exists a mode with a frequency close to the one corresponding to such a rigid reflection and the error introduced by this approach is very small .",
    "once the non - adiabatic pulsation equations are solved in the envelope , we can not completely disregard the radiative core because reflection is only partial . in the radiative core",
    ", we have seen that the eigenfunctions have a huge number of nodes ( up to @xmath49 ! ) .",
    "this makes very difficult to accurately solve the differential problem in this region .",
    "but at the same time , two approximations are valid with high accuracy in this region .",
    "firstly , the internal energy of these deep layers is very high , which justifies the so - called quasi - adiabatic approximation .",
    "this approximation can be presented in different ways @xcite , but leading always to the same final result .",
    "we can present it also as follows .",
    "first , the adiabatic problem is solved to get the eigenfunctions @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  next , these adiabatic eigenfunctions are used to determine @xmath52 from the perturbed diffusion equation : @xmath53 finally , with all these ingredients the work integral can be computed and divided by the inertia to get the damping rate of the modes , which gives in a pure radiative zone without nuclear reactions : @xmath54where @xmath55 ( resp .",
    "@xmath56 ) are the real ( resp .",
    "imaginary ) parts of the angular frequency ( time - dependence : @xmath57 ) .",
    "the quasi - adiabatic treatment is used for the integration in the radiative core ( @xmath58 ) and the full non - adiabatic eigenfunctions are used for the envelope ( @xmath59 ) .      secondly , another important simplification is to use the asymptotic theory in the radiative core .",
    "this theory applies perfectly there since the wavelength of the eigenfunctions is by far smaller than the scale heights of different equilibrium quantities .",
    "a full non - adiabatic asymptotic treatment was derived by @xcite .",

    "finally , it is important to emphasize that using lagrangian or eulerian formalisms can lead to different numerical results . in our first computations , we used a lagrangian formalism , but it did not lead to the appropriate evanescent behaviour of the eigenfunctions in the icz ; instead they showed a large wavelength oscillation .",
    "this comes from the fact that no control of the brunt - visl frequency is possible in a lagrangian formalism .",
    "because of numerical truncation errors , the code does not know if @xmath15 is slightly positive or negative in the icz . with an eulerian formalism instead",
    ", @xmath15 appears explicitly in the movement equation , and the correct value can be attributed to it . as was already pointed out by dziembowski years ago ( private communication ) ,",
    "we emphasize thus that it is much better to use an eulerian formalism for the finite difference scheme inside a deep convective zone .",
    "our numerical method give us therefore the frequencies of the reflected and potentially excited modes by solving numerically , with the fully adiabatic code , the envelope problem first .",
    "we then compute the damping rate of the modes taking into account the envelope and the core for which we made some valid approximations : the use of the quasi - adiabatic approximation and the eigenfunctions of the asymptotic theory .",
