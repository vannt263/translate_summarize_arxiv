    "qubits and quantum gates are the two basic building blocks of quantum computers which are believed to be computationally stronger than their classical counterparts .",
    "one such important gate is the hadamard gate which has found wide applications in computer and communication science  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of seminal papers in quantum computation and information theory where hadamard transform has been used  @xcite .",
    "shor s fast algorithm for factoring and discrete logarithm  @xcite are based on fourier transform which is a generalization of the hadamard transform in higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the toffoli and hadamard gates comprise the simplest quantum universal set of gates @xcite .",
    "so , in order to achieve the full power of quantum computation , one needs to add only the hadamard gate to the classical set .",
    "thus , the role played by the hadamard gate in quantum algorithms is indeed significant .",
    "of late , pati  @xcite has shown that one can not design a universal hadamard gate for an arbitrary unknown qubit .",
    "linearity , which is at the heart of quantum mechanics , does not allow linear superposition of an unknown state @xmath0 with its orthogonal complement @xmath1 .",
    "however , if one considers qubit states from the polar or equatorial great circles on a bloch sphere , then it is possible to design hadamard type of gates . by a hadamard ` type ' gate we mean a unitary matrix that is not exactly a hadamard matrix .",
    "however , it still creates an equal superposition ( up to a sign or a phase ) of a qubit and its complement to produce two orthogonal states .",
    "very recently , song et .",
    "@xcite have tried to implement the hadamard gate in a probabilistic manner for any unknown state chosen from a set of linearly independent states .    motivated by pati s work , our primary aim in this paper is to construct the most general class of qubit states , for which the hadamard gate can be designed in a deterministic way .",
    "this is achieved in sec .",
    "ii , by imposing restrictions ( due to linearity ) on a completely arbitrary unknown quantum state .",
    "states from this set are geometrically represented on the three - dimensional unit sphere known as the bloch sphere . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that certain hadamard ` type ' transformations are indeed possible for arbitrary states when partial information is available .",
    "a hadamard type gate is obtained for qubits chosen from , not only the polar great circle but also from any polar circle .",
    "we also demonstrate with an example , that there is a unique class of states ( up to isomorphism ) associated with a particular gate , satisfying a fixed transformation . as for the second hadamard type of transformation , which is related to the states lying on the equatorial great circle , a new ensemble of states is found . in sec .",
    "iv , unequal superposition of a qubit with its orthogonal complement is investigated .",
    "this is a generalization of the usual hadamard transformation when the two amplitudes are not equal . in this context",
    ", many new classes of quantum states are found for which the unequal superposition works.summary and concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "the hadamard transform @xmath2 , which is a one qubit gate , rotates the two computational basis vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 to two other orthogonal vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus it creates an equal superposition of the amplitudes of the state and its orthogonal .",
    "the matrix representation of the hadamard gate is given by @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the question we ask in this paper is : what is the most general set of qubit states @xmath8 , such that the application of the hadamard gate @xmath2 takes them to two other orthogonal states @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively",
    "? if @xmath0 is completely arbitrary and unknown , then such a universal hadamard gate does not exist @xcite .",
    "so , we shall obtain a special class of qubit states such that @xmath11    we start by considering a completely arbitrary , unknown qubit state @xmath12 and its orthogonal complement @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 are complex numbers obeying the normalization condition @xmath15",
    ". the operator @xmath2 acts linearly , i.e. , @xmath16 . in what follows ,",
    "we show that this restricts the form of @xmath0 to @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real .",
    "now we substantiate the assertions made herein above .",
    "ideally , from the hadamard transformation we obtain @xmath21 and from linearity we get @xmath22 these two expressions should be equal .",
    "hence @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath25 is real .",
    "let @xmath26 , where @xmath19 is a real number . moreover , @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "so the real part of @xmath29 is @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath30 , where @xmath20 is a real number .",
    "thus @xmath0 is of the form @xmath31",
    ". clearly @xmath32 , since @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 has complex as well as real amplitudes when expressed in the computational basis @xmath34 ; the real parts of which are equal .",
    "it can be easily checked , in a similar fashion , that if we consider @xmath35 , we get @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath25 is real ) and @xmath36 ( as @xmath25 is real ) leading to the same result .",
    "thus @xmath13 is restricted to the form @xmath37 .",
    "our next task is to map the states from this ensemble to points on the bloch sphere .",
    "but before attempting to do this , we give a brief pedagogical description of how to geometrically represent a general qubit state on the bloch sphere .",
    "consider @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 . let @xmath40 .",
    "hence , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are real .",
    "thus , any qubit @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 .",
    "further , two qubits @xmath45 and @xmath46 is mapped to a point @xmath47 on the unit bloch sphere . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the usual polar and azimuthal angles respectively , and they are related to the cartesian coordinates @xmath50 through the usual relations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "if we fix @xmath54 , then we obtain states of the form @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "these lie on the polar great circle of the bloch sphere . on the other hand , for @xmath58 , one obtains states of the form @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 , which lie on the equatorial great circle .",
    "now we can conveniently plot the states from our special ensemble @xmath62 .",
    "bringing it to the desired form , it is clear that @xmath63 .",
    "we thus arrive at the following identification : @xmath64    these points are represented by curve 1 on the bloch sphere .",
    "next , we consider @xmath12 and the other orthogonal complement @xmath65 , which differs from the first one just by an overall negative sign .",
    "this yields that @xmath0 must be of the form @xmath66 , with @xmath67 where @xmath68 , since @xmath19 is real . therefore , in the computational basis",
    ", the qubit state @xmath0 has complex and imaginary amplitudes ; the imaginary parts of which are equal . as for @xmath69",
    ", it assumes the form @xmath70 .    for the qubits of the form @xmath66 , we have @xmath71 . thus on the bloch sphere : @xmath72    it is immediately clear that a point represented by eq([al1 ] ) , for a particular value of @xmath19 , is exactly equal to the one obtained from eq([al2 ] ) for the same value of @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that these two ensembles give the same trajectory on the bloch sphere .",
    "hence , we shall consider them to be isomorphic to each other .",
    "our result is thus summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] the most general qubit states for which it is possible to design a universal hadamard gate satisfying eq([eq1 ] ) are given by @xmath74 are real such that @xmath75 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that if we choose @xmath76 , then from eq([al1 ] ) , we obtain the point @xmath77 on the bloch sphere ( i.e. , north pole ) , which can be identified with the computational basis state @xmath3 on curve 1 .    in a similar fashion",
    ", the trajectory of @xmath78 can be sketched , which would lie on the other side of the bloch sphere ( not visible in the figure ) .",
    "it can be checked that the orthogonal state @xmath4 would be one of its points @xmath79 ( i.e. , south pole ) .",
    "we demonstrate that this trajectory has some intersection points with the equatorial great circle also . to this end , for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 , and @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "substituting these values we get @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for the second case , @xmath86 and @xmath76 .",
    "this yields @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , if one chooses any qubit @xmath0 from curve 1 in the figure , and takes its orthogonal complement , then the hadamard transformation works perfectly well to generate the superposition . to see it explicitly ,",

    "take any two quantum states @xmath92 from this special ensemble , and their complement states @xmath93 . applying the hadamard transformation ( [ eq1 ] ) on them and taking inner product , we get    @xmath94    @xmath95    any two qubits from this ensemble obey the conjugation rules @xmath96    substituting these conditions in the above inner product relations , it is straightforward to check that the inner product is preserved",
    ". hence , a universal hadamard gate exists for any qubit chosen from this special class .",
    "in this section , we consider some operations which are not exactly hadamard transforms , but similar , in the sense that they produce equal superposition of the amplitudes up to a sign or a phase .",
    "these have been discussed by pati , in the context of qubits from the polar and equatorial great circles . here , we elaborate more on these transformations and present some general results .",

    "we now extend this result to vectors from any polar circle .",
    "take @xmath103 on any of the polar circles , and its orthogonal complement @xmath104 . then , for any @xmath49 , we can construct a unitary operator    @xmath105 $ ] , such that eq([eq1a ] ) is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for @xmath54",

    "it is clear that the unitary operator @xmath110 , satisfying eq([eq1a ] ) , depends on the type of states chosen .",
    "for instance , we get two different gates above , depending on whether @xmath8 belongs to the polar great circle or some other polar circle . therefore ,",
    "if one fixes the operator @xmath110 , then one can show that there is a unique ensemble of states satisfying the transformation ( [ eq1a ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider the gate @xmath109 , and find the associated class of states for which it works .",
    "we follow our previous procedure of taking @xmath12 and its orthogonal complement @xmath13 .",
    "linearity yields , @xmath111 on the other hand , @xmath112 thus , @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "so @xmath25 is imaginary .",
    "moreover , @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116 . therefore , @xmath29 is also imaginary .",
    "hence , given @xmath117 real , we get @xmath118 and @xmath119 . rewriting @xmath120 and representing it on the bloch sphere",

    "the resulting trajectory is that of the polar great circle .",
    "however , if we had taken @xmath69 , we would have got @xmath0 of the form @xmath125 , which again are the states on the polar great circle .",
    "we thus conclude that , up to isomorphism , this is the only class of qubit states which transforms according to eq([eq1a ] ) , under the action of the gate @xmath109 .",
    "alternatively , one can also fix the states and determine the corresponding gate uniquely .",
    "the second kind of operation discussed in  @xcite is that of an equal superposition of amplitudes up to a phase such that @xmath126    this alternative universal definition of a hadamard type gate , has the advantage that it is invariant under the interchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "we shall now focus our attention on unequal superposition of the amplitudes of a qubit state . like the equal superposition case , it is impossible to create unequal superposition of an arbitrary unknown qubit with its complement state @xcite .",
    "our task therefore , is to obtain special classes of states for which such a superposition would be possible .",

    "further , @xmath171 , i.e. , @xmath172 , so , @xmath173 , i.e. , @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are restricted to the form @xmath175 . depending on whether @xmath176 and @xmath25",
    "are both real , or imaginary or complex ( with @xmath168 ) , we get different classes of states for which the unequal superposition transformation ( [ equ1 ] ) holds . for the special value of @xmath177 , this ensemble goes over to the set of states @xmath178",
    "( i.e. , complex and real amplitudes such that real parts are the same ) obtained in sec .",
    "also , the associated hadamard matrix @xmath2 , satisfying the transformation ( [ eq1 ] ) , can be recovered for these values of @xmath179 from the above @xmath110 .",
    "now , analogous to the previous section , we concentrate below , on two specific unequal superposition transformations .      according to the prescription outlined in  @xcite , for the vectors on the polar great circle , one can find a unitary gate",
    "@xmath180 $ ] , where @xmath181 and @xmath159 are now real . in this case @xmath97 and @xmath98 and they transform as @xmath182 this is almost similar to eq([equ1 ] ) , up to an overall sign ( when @xmath159 are real ) .",

    "again , it is easy to see that for the special case @xmath177 , this reduces to the class of states obtained in theorem  [ th3 ] .",
    "in this paper we have found the most general class of qubits ( up to isomorphisms ) for which the hadamard gate can be designed .",
