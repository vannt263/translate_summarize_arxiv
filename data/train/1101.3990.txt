    "<S> we estimate the sensitivity to nano - hertz gravitational waves of pulsar timing experiments in which two highly - stable millisecond pulsars are tracked simultaneously with two neighboring radio telescopes that are referenced to the same time - keeping subsystem ( i.e. `` the clock '' ) . by taking the difference of the two time - of - arrival residual data streams we can exactly cancel the clock noise in the combined data set , thereby enhancing the sensitivity to gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that , in the band ( @xmath0 ) hz , this `` interferometric '' pulsar timing technique can potentially improve the sensitivity to gravitational radiation by almost two orders of magnitude over that of single - telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> interferometric pulsar timing experiments could be performed with neighboring pairs of antennas of the forthcoming large arraying projects .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct detection of gravitational waves is one of the most challenging experimental efforts in physics today . </S>",
    "<S> a successful observation will not only represent a great triumph in experimental physics , but will also provide a new observational tool for obtaining a better and deeper understanding about their sources , as well as a unique test of the various proposed relativistic metric theories of gravity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> pulsar timing experiments aimed at the detection of gravitational radiation have been performed for decades now . </S>",
    "<S> the basic principle underlining the pulsar timing technique is the same as that of other gravitational wave detector designs @xcite : to monitor the frequency variations of a coherent electromagnetic signal exchanged by two or more `` point particles '' separated in space . </S>",
    "<S> as a pulsar continuously emits a series of radio pulses that are received at earth , a gravitational wave passing across the pulsar - earth link introduces fluctuations in the time - of - arrival ( toa ) of the received electromagnetic pulses . by comparing the pulses toas against those predicted by a model </S>",
    "<S> , it is in principle possible to detect the effects induced by any time - variable gravitational fields present , such as the transverse - traceless metric curvature of a passing plane gravitational wave train @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency band in which the pulsar timing technique is most sensitive to ranges from about @xmath1 to @xmath2 hz , with the lower - limit essentially determined by the overall duration of the experiment ( @xmath3 ) , and the upper limit identified by the signal - to - noise ratio of the received radio pulses . to attempt observations of gravitational waves in this way </S>",
    "<S> , it is thus necessary to control , monitor and minimize the effects of other sources of timing fluctuations , and , in the data analysis , to use optimal algorithms based on the different characteristics of the pulsar timing response to gravitational waves ( the signal ) and to the other sources of timing fluctuations ( the noise ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative analysis of the noise sources affecting millisecond pulsar timing searches for gravitational radiation has been highlighted in a recent paper by jenet _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there it has been shown that , in the region ( @xmath0 ) hz of the accessible frequency band , the main noises are due to :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> finiteness of the signal - to - noise ratio in the raw observations ; 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in solar system ephemerides , which are used to correct arrival times at the earth to the barycenter of the solar system ; 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> variation of the index of refraction in the interstellar and interplanetary plasma ; 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic rotational stability of the pulsar , and 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> instability of the local clock against which pulsars are timed , and noise in time transfer if the clock is not located at the observatory site .    </S>",
    "<S> although the timing fluctuations induced by most of these noises can be in principle either reduced or calibrated out , the fundamental noise - limiting sensitivity of pulsar timing experiments is imposed by the timing - fluctuations inherent to the reference clocks that control the toa measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the noise analysis in @xcite indicated that clocks such as the linear - ion - trapped - standard ( lits ) ( presently in - the - field state - of - the art atomic clocks with long - time - scale timing stability ) would result in a sinusoidal strain sensitivity of pulsar timing searches for gravitational waves to a level of about @xmath4 after coherently integrating the data for a period of @xmath5 years . since the characteristic wave amplitude associated with a super - massive black - hole - binaries background </S>",
    "<S> is predicted to be of comparable magnitude at the frequency @xmath6 hz @xcite , it is clear that a single telescope will not be able to unambiguously detect such a gravitational wave signal .    a method for statistically enhancing the signal - to - noise ratio of pulsar timing experiments to backgrounds of gravitational waves </S>",
    "<S> was first proposed by hellings and downs @xcite and further analyzed and improved by jenet _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique relies on cross - correlating pairs of toa residuals data taken by an array of radio telescopes observing highly - stable millisecond pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> since the gravitational wave background is common to all the timing residuals while many noises affecting them are in principle uncorrelated , the cross - correlation technique enhances the strength of the gravitational wave signal over that of the noise .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental configuration we propose in this letter is complementary to the cross - correlation method , in that it provides a way for exactly canceling the clock noise from pairs of toas residuals . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible by relying on toas residuals measured simultaneously by two neighboring radio telescopes tracking , with the same clock , two highly - stable millisecond pulsars located in two different parts of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> since the two toas responses to the gravitational wave signal will be different while the clock timing noise transfer function in the two toa residuals will be the same , by taking the difference of the two time series the clock noise is exactly canceled from the resulting synthesized data while sensitivity to a gravitational wave signal is preserved .    </S>",
    "<S> let us denote with @xmath7 , @xmath8 the two time - of - arrival residuals measured at time @xmath9 at the two telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> their time derivatives can be written in the following way @xcite @xmath10   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + c ( t ) + n_i ( t ) \\ \\ \\ \\ i = 1 , 2 \\ , \\label{residuals}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have denoted with @xmath11 the random process associated with frequency fluctuations due to the clock ( common to the two timing residual measurements ) , with @xmath12 the two random processes associated with frequency fluctuations due to all other noise sources affecting the timing residuals , and the function @xmath13 contains the contribution of a spin-2 gravitational wave transverse - traceless strain tensor @xmath14 in the following way @xmath15 } \\ . \\label{psi}\\ ] ] in eqs.([residuals ] , [ psi ] ) @xmath16 is the vector oriented from telescope @xmath17 to pulsar @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the unit vector associated with the direction of propagation of the wave , and the symbol @xmath19 is the operation of scalar product ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . if we denote with @xmath20 the difference of the time - derivative of the two timing residuals given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ residuals ] ) , we find the resulting interferometric pulsar timing response @xmath21   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ ( 1 - \\uk \\cdot \\un_1 ) \\psi_1(t - l_1(1 + \\uk \\cdot \\un_1 ) )   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & ( 1 - \\uk \\cdot \\un_2 ) \\psi_2(t - l_2(1 + \\uk \\cdot \\un_2 ) ) ] \\ . \\label{interfero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note how the _ two - pulse _ time - structure of the time - derivative of the two toa residuals given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ residuals ] ) becomes a _ three - pulse _ response in the interferometric pulsar timing expression given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ interfero ] ) ; the three pulses correspond to the times a gravitational wave interacts with the earth ( which are the same in the two toas residuals ) and the two millisecond pulsars .    to assess the effectiveness of the interferometric pulsar - timing technique we have estimated its sensitivity by relying on the noise - model discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have assumed that : ( i ) multiple - frequency measurements can be implemented in order to adequately calibrate timing fluctuations due to the intergalactic and interplanetary plasma ; ( ii ) more accurate solar system ephemerides will be available by the time these experiments will be performed ; and ( iii ) the tracked millisecond pulsars have frequency stabilities better than those of the operational ground clocks . </S>",
    "<S> a recent stability analysis of presently known millisecond pulsars @xcite has shown that there might exist some with frequency stabilities superior to those displayed by the most stable operational clocks in the ( @xmath0 ) hz frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized , however , that the interferometric pulsar timing experiments discussed in this letter can also be used to isolate and study the intrinsic pulsars spin - noises with a much higher precision than what currently achievable by single - antenna experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of a detector of gravitational waves has been traditionally taken to be equal to ( on average over the sky and polarization states ) the strength of a sinusoidal gravitational wave required to achieve a given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) over a specified integration time , as a function of fourier frequency . here </S>",
    "<S> we will assume a @xmath22 over an integration time of @xmath5 years . in order to compute the interferometric pulsar timing sensitivity we will consider two millisecond pulsars of comparable intrinsic stability and at a distance of @xmath23 kpc from the earth . </S>",
    "<S> we will also assume the following expression for the power spectrum of the noises @xmath24 introduced in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ residuals ] ) @xmath25 which corresponds to a white - timing noise of @xmath26 nsec . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a fourier band + /- </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cycles / day ( i.e. one sample per day ) . the @xmath26 nsec . </S>",
    "<S> level is the current timing goal of leading timing array experiments as three pulsars are being timed to this level @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational wave sensitivity of our proposed interferometric pulsar timing technique is then defined as the wave amplitude required to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath23 in a ten years integration time : @xmath27/(root - mean - squared gravitational wave response ) . </S>",
    "<S> note the factor @xmath28 multiplying the spectrum @xmath29 follows from treating the noises @xmath30 as independent ; the bandwidth , @xmath31 , was taken to be equal to one cycle/@xmath5 years ( i.e. @xmath32 hz ) . in order to calculate the root - mean - squared gravitational wave response </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed waves to be elliptically polarized and monochromatic , with their wave functions , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , written in terms of a nominal wave amplitude , @xmath35 , and the two poincar parameters , ( @xmath36 , in the following way @xcite @xmath37 we averaged over source direction and polarization states by assuming uniform distribution of the sources over the celestial and polarization spheres respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the averaging was done via monte carlo integration with @xmath38 source position / polarization state pairs per fourier frequency bin and @xmath39 fourier bins across the ( @xmath40 ) hz band .     </S>",
    "<S> defines the direction of propagation of the gravitational wave signal and ( @xmath41 ) are the usual polar angles associated with it . </S>",
    "<S> the two unit vectors , ( @xmath42 ) , define the directions in the sky to the two pulsars , and the angle between them has been denoted with @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the bisector of this angle coincides with the @xmath44-axis of an orthogonal coordinate system in which the @xmath45-axis lies in the plane defined by the two unit - vectors ( @xmath42 ) , and the @xmath46-axis is chosen to form a right - handed orthogonal triplet ( @xmath47).,width=624 ]    . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsars have been assumed to be at equal distance from earth ( @xmath23 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> note the mild dependence of the sensitivity over the angle @xmath48 in the interval of values considered . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of a single - telescope experiment ( blue curve ) , as well as the current estimates of the upper and lower bounds on the characteristic amplitude radiated by an ensemble of super - massive black - hole binaries ( two black dashed - lines ) are included . </S>",
    "<S> see text for details.,width=672 ]    in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) we plot the sensitivity of the interferometric pulsar timing technique as a function of the fourier frequency and for various values of the angle @xmath48 enclosed between the directions to the two pulsars . for sake of simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed the two pulsars to be at an equal distance of @xmath23 kpc from earth . </S>",
    "<S> we have independently analyzed configurations with unequal distances and found no significant differences to the sensitivity curves shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> another property of the sensitivity curves is their mild dependence over the angle @xmath48 ; a configuration with two millisecond pulsars that are separated by only @xmath49 in the sky shows a sensitivity that is only @xmath50 percent worst than that with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for values of @xmath48 smaller than @xmath49 , the sensitivity rapidly worsen and goes to zero at @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course consequence of having assumed , for this calculation , the two pulsars to be at equal distance from earth . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath53 instead , the sensitivity to gravitational radiation does not go to zero at @xmath54 , as it can be easily understood by simple inspection of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ interfero ] ) . since longer joint tracking times can be achieved with pairs of millisecond pulsars that have smaller angular separation , our analysis indicates that these configurations ( with , let s say @xmath55 ) might be preferable to those with larger angle @xmath43 .    for comparison , in fig.([fig2 ] ) we have included the sensitivity of a single - telescope experiment that relies on a lits clock @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although at frequencies larger than about @xmath56 hz this is about a factor of @xmath28 better than that of the interferometric technique ( in this part of the band the noises affecting the interferometric combination are twice as many ) , at frequencies lower than @xmath56 hz the advantage of the interferometric technique becomes evident . in this region of the band </S>",
    "<S> the clock noise dominates all other noise sources in a single - telescope timing residuals data , and our technique exactly cancels it .    in order to put in perspective the sensitivity enhancement brought by the interferometric pulsar timing technique over single - telescope experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we have included the current estimated range of strengths of an astrophysical gravitational wave background from incoherently radiating super - massive black hole binaries @xcite . at @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> hz we find that the most conservative prediction of the strength of such a background would result into an @xmath57 , while a more optimistic estimate of its characteristic strain amplitude would make it detectable with a @xmath58 . </S>"
