    "the last decade witnessed a revolution in neutrino physics . it has been observed that neutrinos have nonzero masses , and that leptons mix .",
    "this fact was proven by the observation that neutrinos can change from one type , or `` flavour '' , to another .",
    "almost all the knowledge we have gathered about neutrinos , is only fifteen years old .",
    "but before diving into the recent `` news '' about neutrinos , lets find out how neutrinos were born .",
    "the 20s witnessed the assassination of many sacred cows , and physics was no exception , one of physic s most holly principles , the conservation of energy , appeared not to hold within the subatomic world .",
    "for some radioactive nuclei , it seemed that part of its energy just disappear , leaving no footprint of its existence .    in 1920 , in a letter to a conference , pauli wrote , `` dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen , ... as a desperate remedy to save the principle of energy conservation in beta decay , ...",
    "i propose the idea of a neutral particle of spin half '' .",
    "pauli postulated that the energy loss was taken off by a new particle , whose properties were such that it would not yet be seen : it had no electric charge and rarely interacted with matter at all .",
    "this way , the neutrino was born into the world of particle physics .    soon afterwards , fermi wrote the four - fermi hamiltonian for beta decay using the neutrino , electron , neutron and proton .",
    "a new field came to existence : the field of weak interactions . and",
    "two decades after pauli s letter , cowan and reines finally observed anti - neutrinos emitted by a nuclear reactor .",
    "as more and more particles were discovered in the following years and observed to participate in weak processes , weak interactions got legitimacy as a new force of nature and the neutrino became a key ingredient of this interactions .",
    "further experiments over the course of the next 30 years showed us that there were three kinds , or `` flavours '' of neutrinos ( electron neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) , muon neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) and tau neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) ) and that , as far as we could tell , had no mass at all .",
    "the neutrino saga might have stop there , but new experiments in solar physics taught us that the neutrino story was just beginning ....    within the standard model , neutrinos have zero mass and therefore interact diagonally in flavour space , @xmath3 since they are mass - less , they move at the speed of light and therefore their flavour remains the same from production up to detection .",
    "it is obvious then , that at least as flavour is concerned , zero mas neutrinos are almost not interesting as compared to quarks .",
    "on the other hand , neutrinos masses different from zero , mean that there are three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath4 , each with a mass @xmath5 .",
    "the meaning of leptonic mixing can be understood by analysing the leptonic decays , @xmath6 of the charged @xmath7 boson .",
    "where , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represents the electron , @xmath11 the muon , or @xmath12 the tau .",
    "we refer to particle @xmath13 as the charged lepton of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "mixing essentially means that when the @xmath15 decays to a given flavour of charged lepton @xmath16 , the neutrino that comes along is not always the same mass eigenstate @xmath17 . _",
    "any _ of the different @xmath17 can show up .",
    "the amplitude for the decay of a @xmath15 to a specific combination @xmath18 is designated by @xmath19 .",
    "the neutrino that is emitted in @xmath15 decay along with the given charged lepton @xmath16 is then @xmath20 this particular combination of mass eigenstates is the neutrino of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 can be collected in a unitary matrix ( analogue to the ckm matrix of the quark sector ) known as the leptonic mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath22 guarantees that every time a neutrino of flavour @xmath14 interacts in a detector and produces a charged lepton , such a charged lepton will be always @xmath13 , the charged lepton with flavour @xmath23 .",
    "that is , a @xmath24 indefectibly creates an @xmath25 , a @xmath26 a @xmath27 , and a @xmath28 a @xmath9 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) , describing a neutrino of definite flavour as a linear combination of mass eigenstates , may be inverted to describe each mass eigenstate @xmath17 as a linear combination of flavours : @xmath29 the @xmath14-flavour `` content '' ( or fraction ) of @xmath17 is clearly @xmath30 . when a @xmath17 interacts and generates a charged lepton , this @xmath14-flavour fraction becomes the probability that the emerging charged lepton be of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "a standard neutrino flavour transition , or `` oscillation '' , can be understood as follows .",
    "a neutrino is produced by a source together with a charged lepton @xmath16 of flavour @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , at the production point , the neutrino is a @xmath31 .",
    "then , after birth , the neutrino travels a distance @xmath32 until it is detected .",
    "there , it is where it reaches a target with which it interacts and produces another charged lepton @xmath33 of flavour @xmath34 .",
    "thus , at the interaction point , the neutrino is a @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 ( for example , if @xmath13 is a @xmath37 but @xmath33 is a @xmath9 ) , then , during its trip from the source to the detection point , the neutrino has transitioned from a @xmath31 into a @xmath35 .",
    "this morphing of neutrino flavour , @xmath38 , is a text - book example of a quantum - mechanical effect .    because , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , a @xmath31 is really a coherent superposition of mass eigenstates @xmath17 , the neutrino that propagates since it is created until it interacts , can be any one of the @xmath17 s , therefore we must add the contributions of all the different @xmath17 coherently . then , the transition amplitude , amp(@xmath38 ) contains a share of each @xmath17 and it is a product of three factors .",
    "the first one is the amplitude for the neutrino born at the production point in combination with an @xmath16 to be , specifically , a @xmath17 .",
    "as we have mentioned already , this amplitude is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the second factor is the amplitude for the @xmath17 created by the source to propagate until it reaches the detector .",
    "we will call this factor prop(@xmath17 ) and will find out its value later .",
    "the third factor is the amplitude for the charged lepton produced by the interaction of the @xmath17 with the detector to be , specifically , an @xmath33 .",
    "as the hamiltonian that describes the interaction of neutrinos , charged leptons and @xmath7 bosons is hermitian , it ensues that if amp(@xmath40 , then amp@xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the third and last factor in the @xmath17 contribution is @xmath42 , and @xmath43        it still remains to be established the value of prop(@xmath17 ) . to determine it , we d better study the @xmath17 in its rest frame .",
    "we will label the time in that system @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath17 does have a rest mass @xmath5 , then in this frame its state vector satisfies the good old schrdinger equation @xmath45 whose solution is given clearly by @xmath46 then , the amplitude for the mass eigenstate @xmath17 to propagate for a time @xmath44 , is simply the amplitude @xmath47 for observing the original @xmath17 @xmath48 after some time as the evoluted state @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "thus prop(@xmath17 ) is only this amplitude where we have used that the time taken by @xmath17 to travel from the neutrino source to the detector is @xmath44 , the proper time .    nevertheless ,",
    "if we want prop(@xmath17 ) to be of any use to us , we must write it first in terms of variables in the laboratory system .",
    "the natural choice is obviously the laboratory - frame distance , @xmath32 , that the neutrino covers between the source and the detector , and the laboratory - frame time , @xmath51 , that slips away during the journey .",
    "the distance @xmath32 is set by the experimentalists through the selection of the place of settlement of the source and that of the detector .",
    "likewise , the value of the time @xmath51 is selected by the experimentalists through their election for the time at which the neutrino is created and that when it is detected .",
    "thus , @xmath32 and @xmath51 are chosen ( hopefully carefully ) by the experiment design , and are the same for all the @xmath17 components of the beam .",
    "different @xmath17 do travel through an identical distance @xmath32 , in an identical time @xmath51 .",
    "we still need two other laboratory - frame variables , they are the laboratory - frame energy @xmath52 and momentum @xmath53 of the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath17 . with the four lab - frame variable and using lorentz invariance , we can obtain the phase @xmath54 in the @xmath55 propagator prop(@xmath17 ) we have been looking for , which ( expressed in terms of laboratory frame variables ) is given by @xmath56    at this point however one may argue that , in real life , neutrino sources are basically constant in time , and that the time @xmath51 that slips away since the neutrino is produced till it dies in the detector is actually not measured .",
    "this argument is right . in real life ,",
    "an experiment averages over the time @xmath51 used by the neutrino to complete its journey .",
    "however , lets consider that two constituents of the neutrino beam , the first one with energy @xmath57 and the second one with energy @xmath58 ( both measured in the lab frame ) , contribute coherently to the neutrino signal produced in the detector . now ,",
    "if we call @xmath51 to the the time used by the neutrino to cover the distance separating the production and detection points , then by the time the constituent whose energy is @xmath59 arrives to the detector , it has raised a phase factor @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we will have an interference between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 beam participants that will include a phase factor @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "when averaged over the non - observed travel time @xmath51 , this factor goes away , _ except when @xmath62_. therefore , only components of the neutrino beam that share the same energy contribute coherently to the neutrino oscillation signal @xcite .",
    "specifically , only the different mass eigenstate constituents of a beam that have the same energy contribute coherently to the oscillation signal .",
    "a mass eigenstate @xmath17 , with mass @xmath5 , and energy @xmath63 , has a momentum @xmath53 given by @xmath64 where , we have used that as the masses of the neutrinos are miserably small , @xmath65 for any energy @xmath63 attainable at a realistic experiment . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , we see that at energy @xmath63 the phase @xmath66 appearing in prop(@xmath17 ) takes the value @xmath67 as the phase @xmath68 appears in all the interfering terms it will eventually disappear when calculating the transition amplitude .",
    "we can get rid of it already now and use @xmath69 ~~ . \\label{eq9}\\ ] ]    applying this result , we can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) that the amplitude for a neutrino born as a @xmath31 to be detected as a @xmath35 after covering a distance @xmath32 through vacuum with energy @xmath63 yields @xmath70 the expression above is valid for an arbitrary number of neutrino flavours and mass eigenstates .",
    "the probability p(@xmath38 ) for @xmath38 can be found by squaring it , giving @xmath71 with @xmath72 in order to get eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) we have used that the mixing matrix @xmath22 is unitary .",
    "the oscillation probability p(@xmath38 ) we have just obtained corresponds to that of a _ neutrino _ , and not to an _ antineutrino _ , as we have used that the oscillating neutrino was produced along with a charged _ antilepton _",
    "@xmath73 , and gives birth to a charged _ lepton _ @xmath74 once it reaches the detector .",
    "the corresponding probability p(@xmath75 ) for an antineutrino oscillation can be obtained from p(@xmath38 ) taking advantage of the fact that the two transitions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are cpt conjugated processes .",
    "thus , assuming that neutrino interactions respect cpt@xcite , @xmath77 then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) we obtain that @xmath78 therefore , if cpt is a good symmetry ( with respect to neutrino interactions ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) tells us that @xmath79{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )    & = & \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } - 4\\sum_{i > j }   \\re ( u^*_{\\alpha i } u_{\\beta i } u_{\\alpha j}u^*_{\\beta j } ) \\sin^2 \\left (   \\delta m^2_{ij}\\frac{l}{4e } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\       &   & \\phantom{\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } } { \\rm \\poptm}\\ ; 2\\sum_{i > j } \\im ( u^*_{\\alpha i } u_{\\beta i }   u_{\\alpha j}u^*_{\\beta j } ) \\sin\\ , \\left ( \\delta m^2_{ij}\\frac{l}{2e } \\right ) ~~ . \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these expressions make it clear that if the mixing matrix @xmath22 is complex , p(@xmath80 ) and p(@xmath38 ) will not be identical , in general .",
    "as @xmath81 and @xmath38 are cp conjugated processes , p@xmath82 would be an evidence of cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "so far , cp violation has been observed only in the quark sector , so its measurement in neutrino oscillations would be quite exciting .",
    "so far , we have been working in natural units , if we return now the @xmath83 s and @xmath84 factor ( we have happily left out ) into the oscillation probability we find that @xmath85 having done that , it is easy and instructive to explore the semi - classical limit , @xmath86 . in this limit",
    "the oscillation length goes to zero ( the oscillation phase goes to infinity ) and the oscillations are averaged out .",
    "the same happens if we let the mass difference @xmath87 become large .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the quark sector ( and the reason why we never study quark oscillations despite knowing that mass eigenstates do not coincide with flavour eigenstates ) .    in terms of real life units ( which are not `` natural '' units ) , the oscillation phase is given by @xmath88 then , since @xmath89 $ ] can be experimentally observed only if its argument is of order unity or larger , an experimental set - up with a baseline @xmath32 ( km ) and an energy @xmath63 ( gev )",
    "is sensitive to neutrino mass squared differences @xmath90 larger that or equal to @xmath91^{-1}$ ] .",
    "for example , an experiment with @xmath92 km , roughly the size of earth s diameter , and @xmath93 gev is sensitive to @xmath94 down to @xmath95 ev@xmath96 .",
    "this fact makes it clear that neutrino oscillation experiments can test super tiny neutrino masses .",
    "it does so by exhibiting quantum mechanical interferences between amplitudes whose relative phases are proportional to these super tiny neutrino mass squared differences , which can be transformed into sizeable effects by choosing an @xmath97 large enough .    but let s keep analysing the oscillation probability and see whether we can learn more about neutrino oscillations by studying its expression .",
    "it is clear from @xmath98{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } ) $ ] that if neutrinos have zero mass , in such a way that all @xmath99 , then , @xmath100{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )   =   \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the experimental observation that neutrinos can morph from one flavour to a different one indicates that neutrinos are not only massive but also that their masses are not degenerate .",
    "actually , it was precisely this evidence the one that led to the conclusion that neutrinos are massive .",
    "however , every neutrino oscillation seen so far has involved at some point neutrinos that travel through matter .",
    "but the expression we derived is valid only for flavour change in vacuum , and does not take into account any interaction between the neutrinos and the matter traversed between their source and their detector .",
    "thus , one might ask whether flavour - changing interactions between neutrinos and matter are indeed responsible of the observed flavour changes , and not neutrino masses . regarding this question ,",
    "two points can be made .",
    "first , although it is true that the standard model of elementary particle physics contains only mass - less neutrinos , it provides an amazingly well corroborated description of neutrino interactions , and this description clearly establishes that neutrino interactions with matter do not change flavour .",
    "second , for at least some of the observed flavour changes , matter effects are expected to be miserably small , and there is solid evidence that in these cases , the flavour transition probability depends on @xmath32 and @xmath63 through the combination @xmath97 , as anticipated by the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "modulo a constant , @xmath97 is precisely the proper time that goes by in the rest frame of the neutrino as it covers a distance @xmath32 possessing an energy @xmath63 .",
    "thus , these flavour transitions behave as if they were a progression of the neutrino itself over time , rather than a result of interaction with matter .    now",
    ", suppose the leptonic mixings were trivial .",
    "this would mean that in the decay @xmath101 , which as we established has an amplitude @xmath39 , the emerging charged antilepton @xmath16 of flavour @xmath14 comes along always with the _ same _ neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath17 .",
    "that is , if @xmath102 , then @xmath103 becomes zero for all @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) it is clear that , @xmath98{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } )   =   \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] .",
    "thus , the observation that neutrinos can change flavour indicates mixing",
    ".    then , there are basically two ways to detect neutrino flavour change .",
    "the first one is to observe , in a beam of neutrinos which are all created of the same flavour , say @xmath14 , some appearance of neutrinos of a new flavour @xmath34 that is different from the flavour @xmath14 we started with .",
    "this is what is called an appearance experiment .",
    "the second way is to start with a beam of identical @xmath31s , whose flux is known , and observe that this known @xmath31 flux is depleted .",
    "this is called a disappearance experiment .    as eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) shows , the transition probability in vacuum does not only depend on @xmath97 but also oscillates with it .",
    "it is because of this fact that neutrino flavour transitions are named `` neutrino oscillations '' .",
    "now notice also that neutrino transition probabilities depend only on neutrino squared - mass _ splittings _ , and not on the individual squared neutrino masses themselves .",
    "thus , oscillation experiments can only measure the neutrino squared - mass spectral pattern , but not its absolute scale , i.e. the distance above zero the entire pattern lies .",
    "it is clear that neutrino transitions can not modify the total flux in a neutrino beam , but simply alter its distribution between the different flavours . actually , from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) and the unitarity of the @xmath22 matrix , it follows that @xmath105{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\alpha $ }   \\longrightarrow   \\shortstack{{\\tiny ( \\rule[.4ex]{1em}{.1 mm } ) }    \\\\ [ -.7ex ] $ \\nu_\\beta $ } ) = 1 ~~ , \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all flavours @xmath34 , including the original flavour @xmath14 .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) makes it transparent that the probability that a neutrino morphs its flavour , added to the probability that it does not do so , is one .",
    "ergo , flavour transitions do not change the total flux .",
    "nevertheless , some of the flavours @xmath36 into which a neutrino can oscillate into may be _ sterile _ flavours ; that is , flavours that do not take part in weak interactions and therefore escape detection .",
    "if any of the original ( active ) neutrino flux turns into sterile , then an experiment measuring the total _ active _ neutrino flux  that is , the sum of the @xmath106 , and @xmath28 fluxes  will find it to be less than the original flux . in the experiments performed up today ,",
    "no flux was ever missed .    in the literature ,",
    "description of neutrino oscillation normally assume that the different mass eigenstates @xmath17 that contribute coherently to a beam share the same _ momentum _ , rather than the same _ energy _ as we have argued they must have .",
    "while the supposition of equal momentum is technically wrong , it is an inoffensive mistake , since , as can easily be shown @xcite , it conveys to the same oscillation probabilities as we have found .",
    "a relevant and interesting case of the ( not that simple ) formula for p@xmath107 is the case where only two flavours participate in the oscillation .",
    "the only - two - neutrino scenario is a rather rigorous description of a vast number of experiments .",
    "lets assume then , that only two mass eigenstates , which we will name @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and two corresponding flavour states , which we will name @xmath26 and @xmath28 , are relevant .",
    "there is then only one squared - mass splitting , @xmath110 .",
    "even more , neglecting phase factors that can be proven to have no effect on oscillation , the mixing matrix @xmath22 takes the simple form @xmath111 the @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) is just a 2@xmath1122 rotation matrix , and the rotation angle @xmath113 within it is referred to as the mixing angle . inserting the @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) and the unique @xmath87 into the general expression for p@xmath107 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , we immediately find that , for @xmath36 , when only two neutrinos are relevant , @xmath114 moreover , the survival probability , i.e. the probability that the neutrino remains with the same flavour its was created with is , as usual , unity minus the probability that it changes flavour .",
    "when we create a beam of neutrinos on earth through an accelerator and send it up to thousand kilometres away to a meet detector , the beam does not move through vacuum , but through matter , earth matter .",
    "the beam of neutrinos then scatters ( coherently forward ) from particles it meets along the way . such a scattering can have a large effect on the transition probabilities .",
    "we will assume that neutrino interactions with matter are flavour conserving , as described by the standard model .",
    "then a neutrino in matter have two possibilities to enjoy coherent forward scattering from matter particles .",
    "first , if it is an electron neutrino , @xmath24and only in this case  can exchange a @xmath7 boson with an electron .",
    "neutrino - electron coherent forward scattering via @xmath7 exchange opens up an extra interaction potential energy @xmath115 suffered exclusively by electron neutrinos . obviously , this additional weak interaction energy has to be proportional to @xmath116 , the fermi coupling constant .",
    "in addition , the interaction energy coming from @xmath117 scattering grows with @xmath118 , the number of electrons per unit volume . from the standard model",
    ", we find that @xmath119 clearly , this interaction energy affects also antineutrinos ( in a opposite way though ) , it changes sign if we replace the @xmath24 by @xmath120 .",
    "the second interaction corresponds to the case where a neutrino in matter exchanges a @xmath121 boson with an matter electron , proton , or neutron .",
    "the standard model teaches us that weak interactions are flavour blind .",
    "every flavour of neutrino enjoys them , and the amplitude for this @xmath121 exchange is always the same .",
    "it also teaches us that , at zero momentum transfer , the @xmath121 couplings to electrons and protons have equal strength and opposite sign .",
    "therefore , counting on the fact that the matter through which our neutrino moves is electrically neutral ( it contains equal number of electrons and protons ) , the electron and proton contribution to coherent forward neutrino scattering through @xmath121 exchange will add up to zero .",
    "then , the effect of the @xmath121 exchange contribution to the interaction potential energy @xmath122 will be equal to all flavors and will depends exclusively on @xmath123 , the number density of neutrons . from the standard model",
    ", we find that @xmath124 as was the case before , for @xmath115 , this contribution will flip sign if we replace the neutrinos by anti - neutrinos .",
    "but we already learnt that standard model interactions do not change neutrino flavour . therefore , unless non - standard - model flavour changing interactions play a role , neutrino flavour transitions or neutrino oscillations points also to neutrino mass and mixing even when neutrinos are propagating through matter .",
    "neutrino propagation in matter is easy to understand when analyzed through a time dependent schrdinger equation in the laboratory frame @xmath125 where , @xmath126 is a multicomponent neutrino vector state , in which each neutrino flavour corresponds to one component . in the same way ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath127 is a matrix in flavour space . to make our lives easy ,",
    "lets analyze the case where only two neutrino flavours are relevant , say @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the fraction of the neutrino that is a @xmath24 at time @xmath51 , and similarly for @xmath130 .",
    "analogously , @xmath127 is a 2@xmath1122 matrix in @xmath131 space .",
    "it will prove to be clarifying to work out the two flavour case in vacuum first , and add matter effects afterwards . using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath132 as a linear combination of mass eigenstates , we can see that the @xmath133 matrix element of the hamiltonian in vacuum , @xmath134 , can be written as @xmath135 where we are supposing that neutrino belongs to a beam where all its mass components ( the mass eigenstates ) share the same definite momentum @xmath136 .",
    "( as we have already mentioned , this supposition is technically wrong , however it leads anyway to the right oscillation probability . ) in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) , we have used that @xmath137 with @xmath138 the energy of the mass eigenstate @xmath139 with momentum @xmath136 , and the fact that the mass eigenstates of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath134 constitute a basis and therefore are orthogonal .",
    "as we have already mentioned , neutrino oscillations are the archetype quantum interference phenomenon , where only the _ relative _ phases of the interfering states play a role .",
    "therefore , only the _ relative _ energies of these states , which set their relative phases , are relevant . as a consequence ,",
    "if it proves to be convenient , we can feel free to happily remove from the hamiltonian @xmath127 any contribution proportional to the identity matrix @xmath140 .",
    "as we have said , this substraction will leave unaffected the differences between the eigenvalues of @xmath127 , and therefore will leave unaffected the prediction of @xmath127 for flavour transitions .",
    "it goes without saying that as in this case only two neutrinos are relevant , there are only two mass eigenstates , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and only one mass splitting @xmath141 , and therefore the @xmath22 matrix is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) . inserting this matrix into eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) , and applying the high momentum approximation @xmath142 , and removing from @xmath134 a term proportional to the the identity matrix ( a removal we know is going to be harmless ) , we get @xmath143 to write this expression , we have used that @xmath144 , where @xmath63 is the average energy of the neutrino mass eigenstates in our neutrino beam of ultra high momentum @xmath136 .",
    "it is not difficult to corroborate that the hamiltonian @xmath134 of eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) for the two neutrino scenario would give an identical oscillation probability , eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) , as the one we have already obtained in a different way . for example , lets have a look at the oscillation probability for the process @xmath145 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) it is clear that in terms of the mixing angle , the electron neutrino state composition is @xmath146 while that of the muon neutrino is given by @xmath147 now , the eigenvalues of @xmath134 , , read @xmath148 the eigenvectors of this hamiltonian , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , can also be written in terms of @xmath151 and @xmath152 by means of eqs .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
