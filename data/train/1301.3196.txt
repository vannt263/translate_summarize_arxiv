    "sawtooth collapse in tokamak plasmas has been a puzzling phenomenon for decades . although the @xmath0 kink - tearing mode is essential for the onset of this dynamics , kadomtsev s full reconnection model  @xcite and the nonlinear growth of the resistive @xmath0 mode  @xcite ( both based on resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) theory ) fail to explain the short collapse times ( @xmath1 ) as well as the partial reconnections observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "since resistivity is small in high - temperature tokamaks , two - fluid effects are expected to play an important role for triggering _",
    "fast _ ( or _ explosive _ ) magnetic reconnection as in solar flares and magnetospheric substorms .    in earlier works  @xcite ,",
    "the linear growth rate of the kink - tearing mode in the collisionless regime has been analyzed extensively by using asymptotic matching , which shows an enhancement of the growth rate due to two - fluid effects , even in the absence of resistivity .",
    "furthermore , direct numerical simulations  @xcite of two - fluid models show acceleration of reconnection in the nonlinear phase , even though realistic two - fluid simulation of high - temperature tokamaks is still a computationally demanding task ( especially when the resistive layer width is smaller than the electron skin depth @xmath2 1 mm ) .",
    "these simulation studies , as a rule , indicate explosive tendencies of collisionless reconnection .",
    "however , theoretical understanding of such explosive phenomena is not yet established due to the lack of analytical development . in the neighborhood of the boundary ( or reconnecting ) layer , a perturbative approach breaks down at an early nonlinear phase and , consequently , asymptotic matching requires a fully nonlinear inner solution  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the quasi - equilibrium analysis developed for resistive reconnection  @xcite , the explosive process of collisionless reconnection should be a nonequilibrium problem , in which inertia is not negligible in the force balance and hence leads to acceleration of flow .",
    "thus , the convenient assumption of _ steady _ reconnection is no longer appropriate .",
    "recent theories  @xcite emphasize the hamiltonian nature of two - fluid models and try to gain deeper understanding of collisionless reconnection in the ideal limit .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to predict the explosive growth of the kink - tearing mode analytically by developing a new nonlinear variational technique that is based on a generalization of the mhd energy principle  @xcite ( for generalization see  @xcite ) . for simplicity , we concentrate on the effect of electron inertia , which is an attractive mechanism for triggering fast reconnection in tokamaks ; estimates of the reconnection rate are favorable  @xcite , nonlinear acceleration is possible  @xcite , and even the more mysterious partial reconnection may be explained by an inertia - driven collapse model  @xcite . while we address the same problem as that of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , our estimated nonlinear growth is quantitatively different from that of this reference , and our result is confirmed by direct numerical simulation .",
    "this advance in nonlinear theory is indispensable for clarifying the acceleration mechanism of collisionless reconnection .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we invoke a conventional 2d slab model for electron inertia - driven reconnection and then construct its lagrangian in terms of the fluid flow map ( as in the ideal mhd theory  @xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , we obtain the linear growth rate of the inertial tearing mode in the large-@xmath3 regime ( corresponding to the @xmath0 kink - tearing mode in tokamaks ) by applying our energy principle to this two - fluid model . we show that a rather simple displacement field is enough to make the potential energy decrease ( @xmath4 ) and to obtain a tearing instability whose growth rate agrees with the asymptotic matching result  @xcite . given these observations ,",
    "we extend the energy principle to a nonlinear regime in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] , where the displacement ( or the magnetic island width ) is larger than @xmath5 .",
    "without relying on perturbation expansion , we directly substitute a form of the displacement map into the lagrangian and attempt to minimize the potential energy @xmath6 .",
    "we show that a continuous deformation of magnetic field - lines into a @xmath7-shape  @xcite asymptotically leads to a steeper decrease of @xmath6 than that of the linear regime , which is indeed found to be responsible for the acceleration phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dissipation ] , the effect of small dissipation on this fast reconnection is considered and implications of our results for sawtooth collapse are finally discussed .",
    "we analyze the following vorticity equation and ( collisionless ) ohm s law for @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10+[\\nabla^2\\psi,\\psi]=0,\\label{vorticity}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial(\\psi - d_e^2\\nabla^2\\psi)}{\\partial t } + [ \\phi,\\psi - d_e^2\\nabla^2\\psi]=0 , \\label{flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11=(\\nabla f\\times\\nabla g)\\cdot\\bm{e}_z$ ]  @xcite .",

    "thus , @xmath17 has the same dimension as @xmath18 ( the so - called alfvn units ) . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the parameter @xmath5 denotes the electron skin depth , which is much smaller than the system size ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ flux ] ) can be seen as the conservation law of the electron canonical momentum defined by @xmath20 . since the magnetic flux @xmath17 is no longer conserved for @xmath21 , the effect of electron inertia permits magnetic reconnection within a thin layer ( @xmath22 ) despite a lack of resistivity in this model .",
    "it should be remarked that , in comparison to the more general two - fluid model  @xcite , the above model assumes cold ions and electrons ; namely , it is too simplified to directly apply to tokamaks . in particular , the effects of the ion - sound gyroradius and the diamagnetic drift are known to modify the linear stability criteria substantially , and resistivity is not so negligible as will be discussed later in sec .",
    "[ sec : dissipation ] .",
    "moreover , the assumption of isothermal electrons ( used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) may also lose its validity in a nonlinear phase according to a fully gyrokinetic description  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , except for resistivity , magnetic field lines can only be broken by electron inertia in the collisionless limit  @xcite , and we will study this key mechanism by analyzing the simplest model , ( [ vorticity ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) .    in the same manner as in ref .",

    ", if we identify the flow map as a lie transform @xmath101 , the lie - series expansion  @xcite of ( [ flux2 ] ) leads to @xmath102 where @xmath60 should agree with the eigenmode ( [ bold_xi ] ) in the lowest order .",
    "thus , such a perturbation expansion easily fails to converge when the displacement @xmath30 ( or the island width ) reaches the boundary layer width @xmath22 , due to a steep gradient @xmath103 of the eigenfunction inside the layers ( see figure  [ eigenfunction ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , the flux is expanded in the region ( iii ) and the blue area of figure  [ slab_test](left ) is almost doubled in figure  [ slab_test](right ) .",
    "the resultant forms of @xmath32 and @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ psi_e ] .",

    "the associated explosive growth of @xmath30 would continue until @xmath30 reaches the system size and leads to an equilibrium collapse during a finite time @xmath138 .",
    "although our analytical model is too simple to explain all sawtooth physics in tokamaks , the time scale of explosion ( @xmath200 ) that is predicted in this work is comparable to experimentally observed sawtooth collapse times  @xcite .",
    "however , resistivity is not negligible in tokamaks and tends to decelerate the reconnection .",
    "our simulations exhibit nonlinear acceleration only for the case of @xmath201 , which can be fulfilled by the experiments . in more realistic plasmas ,",
    "the strong current spike generated by electron inertia would cause rapid heating of the plasma , which would reduce the local resistivity @xmath150 , and , what is more , would produce runaway electrons .",
    "since these effects also act as positive feedback , we expect that sawtooth collapse occurs once the acceleration condition @xmath188 is satisfied at the @xmath174 surface .",
