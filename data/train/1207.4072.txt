    "<S> we establish a general mechanism for highly efficient quantum transport through finite , disordered 3d networks . </S>",
    "<S> it relies on the interplay of disorder with centro - symmetry and a dominant doublet spectral structure , and can be controlled by proper tuning of _ only _ coarse - grained quantities . </S>",
    "<S> photosynthetic light harvesting complexes are discussed as potential biological incarnations of this design principle .    in a variety of fields , ranging from quantum information @xcite to solar cell physics </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the efficient transport of quanta is of paramount importance . in realistic setups , however , one typically encounters systems which are complex in nature and only allow for a limited degree of control . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is relevant to understand which general conditions are required such that fundamental principles of quantum mechanics can be exploited to enhance transport in complex systems . at present , this question is still widely open .    </S>",
    "<S> common wisdom suggests that quantum interference can enhance transport across perfectly periodic potentials @xcite , while it tends to suppress transport in disordered systems @xcite . in general </S>",
    "<S> , multi - path quantum interference leads to erratic , large scale fluctuations of transmission probabilities when boundary conditions or other system parameters are slightly changed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are often indicative of the strong , non - linear coupling of few degrees of freedom , as it abounds in heavy nuclei @xcite , ultra - cold many - particle dynamics @xcite , strongly perturbed rydberg systems @xcite , billiard geometries for photons @xcite and electrons @xcite , strongly driven quantum systems @xcite , and in large molecules @xcite . often devices which transport quanta tend to avoid these fluctuations , however one may wonder whether they can be exploited .    in the present contribution </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to identify design principles for the properties of disordered hamiltonians that , supported by large scale fluctuations , may generate _ quantum - enhanced _ transport . </S>",
    "<S> these design principles are statistically robust , in the sense that they are `` implementable '' by controlling only few coarse - grained parameters . as it is our goal to illustrate the great potential of constructive interference in disordered quantum systems , we choose to evade technical details of any specific implementation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a collection of random hamiltonians amended by only two additional constraints features high probabilities for near - to - perfect single - excitation transport across the abstract networks they can be associated with . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of transfer efficiencies is fully controlled by the networks electronic density of states , some _ average _ coupling matrix element , and the complex size ( in terms of number of constituents ) , which are easily controllable e.g. in macromolecular design @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as a potential application , we discuss the possible role of our findings for efficient light harvesting in photosynthetic complexes . </S>",
    "<S> while it is not our intention to perform a detailed analysis of these complicated biological structures , we rather wish to scrutinize the relevance of the introduced design principles in the light of available structure data .    as a working model we consider the coherent transport of one excitation across a disordered 3d network of @xmath0 sites . </S>",
    "<S> hilbert space is spanned by the basis states @xmath1 which represent those states where the excitation is fully localized at the network s site @xmath2 . in order to formulate a quantitative , statistical theory , </S>",
    "<S> we generate different realizations of disorder by sampling over @xmath3 random hamiltonians @xmath4 extracted from the gaussian ortogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix entries @xmath5 encode the couplings between sites @xmath2 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for each realization , input @xmath7 and output @xmath8 are defined as those sites with the weakest coupling @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our figure of merit is the transfer efficiency @xmath10 which quantifies a given random network s performance in terms of excitation transport from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is gauged against the direct coupling @xmath12 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the absence of all intermediate sites , through the definition of the associated benchmark time scale @xmath13 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier studies of coupled dipoles suggested that a _ centro - symmetric _ structure of the hamiltonian with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a valuable ingredient for perfect - state transfer in dipole - dipole networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is defined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the exchange matrix , @xmath17@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for goe hamiltonians on which centro - symmetry is imposed , the transfer efficiencies are still rather broadly distributed , implying that centro - symmetry alone is not sufficient for efficient state transfer . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we need to identify an additional structural element which guarantees robustness , in the sense that the transfer efficiency must not depend strongly on the specific conformation of the intermediate sites . such a feature is also of obvious relevance for our model s applicability to real light harvesting complexes , which continuously undergo conformational changes ( whether noisy or deterministic ) on the macromolecular scale .    </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , structural stability of efficient excitation transfer from @xmath7 to @xmath8 is guaranteed if both states are coupled through a _ </S>",
    "<S> dominant tunneling doublet _ in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the sole role of the intermediate states is then to _ collectively amend _ the effective tunneling coupling by an energy shift @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath18 , which strongly fluctuates under variations of the network conformation ( induced by the coupling to some background degrees of freedom , e.g. vibrational modes of macromolecular structures @xcite ) , has the proper sign , this can lead to a _ </S>",
    "<S> dramatic _ enhancement of the transfer efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> such collective shifts induced by the coupling to random or  </S>",
    "<S> chaotic \" states have been investigated in the context of _ chaos assisted tunneling ( cat ) _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and will enter as the key ingredient of the subsequent analytical description of our problem .    given the centro - symmetry of @xmath4 , it can be cast , through an orthogonal transformation to the eigenbasis of the exchange operator @xmath16 , into the block diagonal representation @xcite @xmath19 in this new form , both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are again @xmath22 goe matrices , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the elements @xmath23 are sampled from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath24 .    since two of the eigenvectors of @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> have the form @xmath25 we now additionally assume ( see above ) that @xmath26 and @xmath27 form a dominant doublet , such that they are both close to eigenstates @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is then useful to write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hblock ] ) as @xmath30 which makes the definition of rows and columns which relate to @xmath26 and @xmath27 explicit . from the definition of @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 contains the ( gaussian distributed ) couplings of the dominant doublet states @xmath31 to the remainder of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the dominant doublet assumption,@xmath34 the norm @xmath35 of the coupling is small and , under this condition , perturbation theory guarantees that @xmath36 in ( [ eq : matrix ] ) are eigenvalues of @xmath4 , up to some perturbative correction term @xmath37 . the explicit expression for the transfer efficiency </S>",
    "<S> is then dominated by those terms associated with @xmath38 , leading to the estimate @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath43 . from ( [ eq : finaleff ] ) it is clear that the efficiency is large , @xmath44 , if @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is smaller than @xmath47 , and we can interpret @xmath48 as an effective tunneling rate . </S>",
    "<S> all realizations for which we obtain @xmath49 have efficient transport which is faster than the direct coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dominant doublet assumption alone does not guarantee this latter condition , rather this is a fundamental consequence of the strong fluctuations that arise due to the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this may be induced , for example , by the coupling of some complex background degrees of freedom , such as vibrational modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only a sufficiently broad distribution of @xmath18 guarantees that efficient transfer can _ always _ be achieved , even if the direct coupling @xmath12 between input and output site _ vanishes </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , despite weakly coupled , the presence of the intermediate , random sites of the network as represented by @xmath50 is absolutely crucial to achieve efficient transport .    for fixed @xmath51 and @xmath12 the distribution of @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> was already derived within the context of cat @xcite and in @xcite , and it turned out that for large @xmath0 it is a cauchy distribution . in our present problem , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 and @xmath12 are themselves stochastic variables , and , therefore , should be averaged over . </S>",
    "<S> since the integrations over @xmath51 and @xmath12 are dominated by their mean values , given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that the probability distribution of @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 the expectation value of @xmath59 for all realizations where the dominant doublet assumption holds .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution ( [ eq : dist ] ) depends on only two _ coarse grained _ parameters : @xmath60 characterizes the spectral density of the eigenstates of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while @xmath58 measures the average coupling strength of the dominant doublet to these states . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore can not be emphasized enough that , within the picture here elaborated , the transport properties of the problem _ do not _ depend on the specificities of the hamiltonian , or the intermediate electronic states of the network . to validate our theoretical model by numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we generate many goe hamiltonians with the additional constraint of centro - symmetry with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for each of these hamiltonians the existence of a dominant doublet </S>",
    "<S> is assessed by inspection of its eigenvectors and by verifying that , for some @xmath38 , the condition @xmath63 holds . </S>",
    "<S> this post - selection defines the statistical ensemble which we expect to satisfy ( [ eq : dist ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath64 is then obtained by numerical propagation of the quantum dynamics generated by the hamiltonian , and @xmath65 is defined as the earliest point in time for which @xmath66 .    fig .  1 compares numerical results and analytical prediction ( [ eq : dist ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noticed that there are no free parameters involved in this plot : the values @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 which enter ( 5 ) are either given a priori or directly extracted from the statistical characterization of the numerically generated sample hamiltonians .     </S>",

    "<S> inset : histograms of the transfer efficiencies @xmath64 for three different matrix ensembles , fixed density of states @xmath67 , @xmath70 network sites . as the ensemble is constrained from goe to centro - symmetric and to centro - symmetric with dominant doublet condition @xmath71 , the average efficiencies are dramatically enhanced . ]    clearly , the majority of realizations have @xmath65 smaller than the time scale set by the direct coupling @xmath12 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the fat algebraic tail of the cauchy distribution for @xmath73 guarantees that realizations with very fast transport are abundant in the sense that they are not exponentially unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> for fixed @xmath74 , our model predicts efficiencies larger than @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed observed in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the probability distribution of the efficiencies , which is sharply peaked above @xmath76 ( see arrow ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison , in the same figure , with the probability distributions of the efficiencies of centro - symmetric goe matrices without the doublet constraint , and of general goe matrices , respectively , shows that in both cases the average efficiency is significantly lower than for those centro - symmetric hamiltonians which exhibit the additional design element of a dominant doublet .    </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable asset of this transport mechanism is its robustness under different realizations of disorder , which , in the context of networks , refers to different configurations of the intermediate sites ( represented by the random matrices @xmath77 in ( [ eq : matrix ] ) ) . in the light of the recent debate on the potential role and unexpected robustness of quantum coherence in photosynthetic harvesting of the sunlight s energy @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one may wonder whether the proposed design principles are implemented by nature . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , some of the light harvesting complexes which are hardwired in bacteria or plants , such as the fmo complex of green sulfur bacteria @xcite exhibit an apparently disordered , network - like structure , and appear to be optimized for efficient transport .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore suggestive to test the hypothesis that centro - symmetry and dominant doublet are compatible with the available structure data @xcite . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we fix the spatial position of the fmo s constituent bchl_a _ molecules as given in the literature @xcite ( see table i , supplementary material ) , and only allow the orientation of the dipoles associated with each of the bchl_a _ s to vary . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we neglect on - site energy shifts induced by the coupling to background degrees of freedom , i.e. , all on - site energies are assumed to be identical . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a possible limitation of the maximally achievable transfer efficiencies to values smaller than @xmath78 ( similar to the limitation of the maximum transfer amplitude by the bias in an asymmetric double - well potential ) this does not affect the central features of our transport scenario @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given the spatial positions of the dipoles , the inter - site dipole - dipole coupling matrix elements @xmath5 are determined by their relative orientations @xcite ( table ii , supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> to certify the relevance of our dominant doublet picture elaborated above for abstract , disordered networks , we now ask the question how close the documented fmo conformations are to optimal conformations in the above sense . </S>",
    "<S> to give an answer to this question , we use the tabulated fmo data to seed a genetic algorithm with the transfer efficiency ( [ eq : eff ] ) as target function , and only allow for variations of the intermediate sites dipole orientations ( variations of the coupling to and between the intermediate sites generate the nontrivial and crucial statistics of the level shifts @xmath18 in the cat scenario that underlies our analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then correlate the thus achieved optimal transfer efficiencies with the optimal networks centro - symmetry quantifiers @xcite , @xmath79 ( where the minimisation runs over all permutations of the intermediate network sites @xmath80 , and the hilbert - schmidt norm @xcite is employed ) , and the dominant doublet strengths @xmath81 ( here defined as the minimum of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are benchmarked against optimisation results seeded by random orientations of the dipoles , and illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the synchronous trend towards significantly enhanced efficiencies , centro - symmetries and doublet strengths is _ unambiguous and in stark contrast _ to the benchmark ensemble represented by crosses in the plot , which also reflect some correlation between efficiency , centro - symmetry and doublet strength , but lack the essentially deterministic attraction towards optimal performance which manifests in the fmo s vicinity .    on top of this evolutionary attraction towards optimal performance in the fmo neighbourhood , in response to our above question , </S>",
    "<S> the dipole orientations which result from evolutionary optimisation are indeed very close to the dipole orientations as given by the experimental data : fig . [ </S>",
