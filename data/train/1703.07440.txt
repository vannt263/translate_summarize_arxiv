    "recently , the author proposed a new alternative vector theory of gravity which assumes that universe has fixed background geometry - four dimensional euclidean space , and gravity is a vector field in this space which breaks the euclidean symmetry @xcite .",
    "direction of the vector gravitational field gives the time coordinate , while perpendicular directions are spatial coordinates .",
    "similarly to general relativity , the theory postulates that gravitational field is coupled to matter universally and minimally through a metric tensor which , however , is not an independent variable but rather a functional of the vector gravitational field .",
    "such assumptions yield a unique theory of gravity . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it passes all available tests , including the recent detection of gravitational waves by ligo @xcite .",
    "vector gravity predicts lack of black holes and gravitational waveforms measured by ligo are interpreted as being produced by orbital inspiral of massive neutron stars that can exist in the theory .",
    "the measured waveforms can be fitted in the framework of vector gravity as accurately as in general relativity svid16 .",
    "for cosmology vector gravity predicts the same evolution of the universe as general relativity with cosmological constant and zero spatial curvature .",
    "however , vector gravity provides explanation of the dark energy as energy of longitudinal gravitational field induced by the universe expansion and yields , with no free parameters , the value of @xmath1 which agrees with the recent planck result @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , vector gravity solves the dark energy problem .",
    "physical explanation of the dark energy in vector gravity is the following .",
    "expansion of the universe yields change of spatial scale with time which can be viewed as an increase of the distance between masses .",
    "this generates matter current directed away from an observer .",
    "such current induces longitudinal vector gravitational field in a similar way as electric current creates vector potential in classical electrodynamics .",
    "average energy of the longitudinal gravitational field induced by the universe expansion is the mysterious dark energy .",
    "contrary to matter , it has negative energy density and accelerates expansion of the universe .",
    "despite of fundamental differences , vector gravity and general relativity yield for the experimentally tested regimes quantitatively very close predictions which allowed both theories to pass available tests",
    ". in particular , vector gravity and general relativity are equivalent in the post - newtonian limit . at strong field",
    ", however , vector gravity substantially deviates from general relativity and yields no black holes .",
    "namely , the end point of a gravitational collapse is not a point singularity but rather a stable star with a reduced mass .",
    "one should mention that black holes have never been observed directly and evidences  of their existence are based on the presumption that general relativity describes gravity for strong field . until signatures of the event horizons are found the existence of black holes will not be proven .",
    "prediction of the matter behavior at strong gravity and interpretation of the universe evolution on large scales depends on the theory of gravity we are using .",
    "thus , there is a need for a feasible test which can distinguish between vector gravity and general relativity and rule out one of the two theories .",
    "here we propose such an experiment that can be done in the nearest years using gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "both in general relativity and vector gravity the polarization of gravitational waves emitted by orbiting binary objects is transverse , that is wave yields motion of test particles in the plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation .",
    "however , as we show , dependence of the laser interferometer signal on the orientation of the interferometer arms relative to the propagation direction of the gravitational wave is different in the two theories .",
    "gravitational wave produces motion of the interferometer mirrors and changes phase velocity of light . both of these effects contribute to the relative phase shift of light traveling in the perpendicular arms of the michelson interferometer . for certain propagation directions of the gravitational wave relative to the arms",
    "the two contributions cancel each other yielding zero net phase shift .",
    "those are the directions of zero response of the interferometer for which gravitational wave can not be detected for any transverse polarization .",
    "as we show , directions of the zero response are different for transverse gravitational waves in vector gravity and general relativity .",
    "detection of a wave in the direction of the zero response predicted by a theory of gravity will rule out such theory .",
    "in vector gravity for a weak transverse plane gravitational wave propagating along the @xmath3axis the equivalent metric reads @xcite@xmath4where @xmath5 is minkowski metric and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are small perturbations obeying the wave equation . a rest particle ( or mirrors of an interferometer )",
    "will move under the influence of the gravitational wave ( met1 ) with a time - dependent velocity @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation . by making a coordinate transformation into the co - moving frame of the test particle @xmath12the",

    "metric ( [ met1a ] ) is written in the coordinate system in which test particles do not move under the influence of the gravitational wave .",
    "on the other hand , in general relativity for a weak gravitational wave propagating along the @xmath3axis the metric in the co - moving frame evolves as @xcite@xmath16    here we investigate a response of a laser interferometer with perpendicular arms on a gravitational wave in the two theories of gravity . in gravitational field with a metric @xmath17 the maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic field vector @xmath18 in the absence of charges read@xmath19 = 0 ,   \\label{max1}\\]]while the lorenz gauge equation is@xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22det@xmath23 .",
    "gravitational wave causes oscillation of @xmath17 in space and time .",
    "however , since frequency of the gravitational waves is much smaller then frequency of the electromagnetic waves traveling in the interferometer one can disregard derivatives of the metric in eqs .",

    "( [ max1 ] ) and ( [ max2 ] ) reduce to@xmath24@xmath25combining them together we obtain@xmath26    in the co - moving frame there is no motion of the interferometer mirrors and the phase shift of light traveling along the two arms appears due to difference in the light phase velocity .",

    "( [ max5 ] ) , where @xmath28 is a small perturbation that has only spatial components @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , yields the following propagation equation for the electromagnetic wave@xmath32 in this equation , @xmath29 can be approximately treated as constants since they vary slowly as compared to the fast variation of @xmath33 .",
    "looking for solution of eq .",
    "( [ max7 ] ) in the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the wave vector of the electromagnetic wave , we obtain the following dispersion relation for light@xmath36and , hence , the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave is ( see also gert63)@xmath37where @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ max8 ] ) shows that presence of the gravitational wave leads to the change of the phase velocity of light which depends on the direction of the light propagation @xmath39 .",

    "the gravitational wave in general relativity can produce signal .",
    "this difference can be used to test theories of gravity in future polarization experiments with several ligo - like interferometers .",
    "the experiment can be conducted with three interferometers .",
    "simultaneous detection of the gravitational wave by all three instruments allows us to determine the direction of the wave propagation by measuring the wave arrival times at the interferometer locations . by detecting many of such events one can collect statistics and find a distribution of the direction of the detected gravitational waves relative to the interferometer arms .",

    "for such a wave propagating along the @xmath3axis the equivalent metric in the co - moving frame reads @xcite@xmath81longitudinal gravitational waves produce no interferometer signal if they propagate at equal angles relative to the interferometer arms ( more exactly when @xmath82 ) .",

    "[ arms]_b _ is the direction of zero response for all kind of gravitational waves in vector gravity .",
