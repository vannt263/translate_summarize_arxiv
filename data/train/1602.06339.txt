    "it is well known that the description of the congruence classes of a semigroup , contrary to what happens in a group or in a ring , poses special problems and usually requires very delicate considerations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3 ) ) .",
    "therefore it is no wonder that the study of congruences is among the topics attracting more attention when researching semigroups , something well illustrated by the fact that the few years of this century already witnessed the publication of more than @xmath20 research papers on the topic .",
    "given the ubiquitous nature of the direct product construction , it comes quite as a surprise to realize that almost nothing is known about congruences on direct products of semigroups , even when the congruences on each factor of the product are known . here",
    "we start that study trusting that this will be the first contribution in a long sequence of papers describing the congruences of direct products of transformation semigroups . before closing this introduction it is also worth to add that we have been led to this problem , not by the inner appeal of a natural idea ( describing the congruences of direct products of very important classes of semigroups whose congruences",
    "were already known ) , but by considerations on the centralizer in @xmath0 of idempotent transformations .",

    "we give an idea of how the congruences look like on a semigroup of the form @xmath30 .",
    "section [ s : matrix ] is devoted to the description of the congruences on @xmath9 following @xcite , and we dedicate section [ s : principalf ] to characterizing the principal congruences on @xmath12 .",

    "( recall that sets and vector spaces are examples of independence algebras ; for definitions and results see @xcite . )",
    "[ p7.10 ] let @xmath910 be a finite dimension independence algebra .",
