    "ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions probe the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions @xcite . lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations @xcite predict that ordinary nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "an important question is whether the high - energy density matter formed in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions lives sufficiently long enough to reach thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "that is does the matter reaches thermal , mechanical and chemical equilibrium ? in this work",
    "we assume that the matter reaches thermal and mechanical equilibrium after proper time @xmath0 .",
    "we do not , however , assume that the matter is in chemical equilibrium . under these assumptions , and given initial values for temperature and the quark , antiquark and gluon number densities , we can then employ fluid dynamics to study the subsequent evolution of the kinetically equilibrated quark - gluon phase , coupled to the rate equations which determine the chemical composition of the system far away from equilibrium .",
    "this problem has been studied previously in @xcite using ideal fluid , in @xcite using first order theory of dissipative fluid dynamics , and recently in @xcite using parton cascade .",
    "ideal ( euler ) fluid dynamics has been useful in describing most of the observables at rhic @xcite . in the early stages of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "non  equilibrium effects play a dominant role .",
    "a complete description of the dynamics of heavy ion reactions needs to include the effects of dissipation through non  equilibrium / dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "as is well  known @xcite , second order ( or extended ) theories ( which are hyperbolic and causal ) of dissipative fluids due to grad @xcite , mller @xcite , and israel and stewart @xcite were introduced to remedy some undesirable features such as acausality .",
    "it seems appropriate therefore to resort to hyperbolic theories instead of first order theories ( which are parabolic ) in describing the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "first order theories are due to eckart @xcite and to landau and lifshitz @xcite and they lead to navier - stokes - fourier ( nsf ) equations which may be acausal .",
    "in addition the first order theories do not have well - posed initial value problem .",
    "in this work we extend the work of @xcite to include chemically non - equilibrium effects . for partially equilibrated plasma of massless particles the equation of state",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath1 t^{4 } \\enspace,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the number of quark flavours , and the @xmath5 are the parton fugacities defined through @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are the equilibrium parton densities @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the shear viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath11 where the shear viscosity coefficients for the quarks and gluons are given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the strong coupling constant .",
    "we take @xmath16 throughout this analysis , unless otherwise stated .",
    "in fig . [ fig : temp](a , b ) we show the well known results ( see @xcite ) of the temperature evolution .",
    "the ideal fluid dynamics approximation leads to faster cooling . due to the reduction of longitudinal pressure ,",
    "less work is done to the expansion and hence the slow cooling in the presence of viscosity .",
    "however the first order theory even predicts heating during the expansion stage .",
    "this is in contradiction to the energy conservation laws .",
    "also the first order theory will overestimate the freeze - out temperatures .",
    "this in turn might lead to wrong conclusions about the observables .",
    "on the other hand the second order theory does not have these undesirable features that are exhibited by first order theory .        in figs .",
    "[ fig : gfug](a , b ) and [ fig : qfug](a , b ) we show time evolution of the parton fugacities . in the presence of viscosity",
    "the parton viscosities evolve more slowly towards chemical equilibration .",
    "this will have considerable effects on the observables such as strangeness production . in the early stages of the expansion of the system one sees the difference between first order theory and second order theory .",
    "this difference is investigated in more detail @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effects of shear viscosity on the chemical equilibration of the parton system in relativistic nuclear collisions . due to slow cooling of the system in the presence of viscosity chemical equilibration is slowed .",
    "the effects of transverse expansion @xcite and of the mass of strange quark in the chemically non - equilibrated viscous system are being studied and will be published somewhere @xcite .    9 a compilation of current rhic results",
