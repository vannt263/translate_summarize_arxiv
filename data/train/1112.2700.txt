    "in february of 2011 , 1235 _ kepler _ transiting candidate planets were announced by @xcite , amongst which the majority are expected to be genuine @xcite . at the latest counting , the score has since risen to 1781 @xcite and is expected to continue rising . due to the unprecedented yield of new transiting planet candidates , follow - up with radial velocity ( rv ) measurements is generally not feasible due to both the typical faintness of the targets and the intensive nature of the required telescope time for so many targets .",
    "historically , radial velocity has emerged as the tool of choice to confirm transiting candidates and so the _ kepler _ team have devoted considerable effort to find ways to confirm candidates without the need for rv .",
    "this has led to some pioneering techniques such as blend analysis @xcite and confirmation through transit timing variations ( ttv ) @xcite .",
    "however , even though transiting candidates have been shown to be confirmable without rv , its absence means that the orbital eccentricity , @xmath2 , of the planets can not be determined ( unless very strong ttvs are detected ) .",
    "one remaining avenue to constrain @xmath2 is to detect an occultation event .",
    "occultations occur exactly half an orbital period after the transit event for a circular orbit but become offset for eccentric orbits , thus offering a potential diagnostic of eccentricity ( details on the precise obtainable constraints are provided in @xcite ) .",
    "such occultations are due to a combination of reflected light from the planet and thermal emission ( which is very small in _ kepler _ s visible bandpass e.g. @xcite ) . despite _ kepler s _ ground - breaking photometric precision ,",
    "most transiting planets discovered so far have not exhibited such events ( one notable exception is the high albedo planet kepler-7b , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the majority of cases we are left without any way of characterizing the orbital eccentricity .    our principal motivation for addressing this problem stems from the fact that based upon the estimated frequency of earth - like planets @xcite , it seems probable that _ kepler _ will detect numerous habitable - zone earth - radius planets .",
    "after the initial detection , the natural question we will be `` can this world sustain life ? '' .",
    "a high orbital eccentricity causes a planet to spend the majority of its orbit outside the habitable - zone and thus leads to potentially marginal or transient habitability @xcite .",
    "for example , eccentricities in excess of @xmath3 for a habitable - zone planet around a sun - like star cause equilibrium temperatures to vary by more than 100k .",
    "the ability to measure , or at least constrain , eccentricity therefore would greatly benefit the assessment of an exoplanet s habitability .",
    "recently , @xcite ( m11 from here on in ) have studied the problem in an effort to glean some information about the eccentricity of a transiting planet .",
    "their approach is that if one knows the stellar density a - priori , say from stellar spectroscopy combined with evolution models , then one can compute the maximum allowed transit duration for a planet on a circular orbit using ( note that this approach was originally outlined in @xcite ) :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the duration between the planet s",
    "centre crossing the stellar limb to exiting under the same condition , @xmath6 is the stellar radius , @xmath7 is the planet s orbital period and @xmath8 is the planet s semi - major axis .",
    "the above equation assumes an equatorial transit and hence is the maximum duration possible . m11",
    "discuss how if the observed transit duration exceeds this quantity ( i.e. @xmath9 ) , this indicates that the orbit must be eccentric .",
    "the two weaknesses in this approach are that : 1 ) the spectroscopically determined value of @xmath6 has both a large statistical uncertainty and a large and unknown systematic uncertainty ( for example , @xcite state that the kepler input catalogue effective temperatures and radii estimations are reliable for sun - like stars , but are `` untrustworthy '' for stars with @xmath10k ) .",
    "2 ) a planet can be eccentric yet still cause @xmath11 i.e. only planets transiting near to apoapse , the slowest part of the orbit , will be identified as eccentric , which is for @xmath12 .",
    "the first weakness means the technique is model - dependent and that an individual system may not be reliable due to possible systematic errors in @xmath6 .",
    "the second weakness limits the scope of application of the technique to planets with @xmath13 and @xmath12 , which it should be noted is the least probable value of @xmath14 from geometric priors @xcite .",
    "m11 show that the @xmath6 uncertainty weakness can be overcome by adopting a statistical perspective .",
    "even though an individual system may not be reliable , the bulk of systems should be and so any overall distributions which emerge should be reliable .",
    "the valuable technique of m11 allows us to actually say something about the eccentricities of the _ kepler _ candidates as a whole .",
    "but what about individual systems ? or those which do nt both fortuitously transit near @xmath12 and",
    "have @xmath13 ?",
    "if the star has been studied with asteroseismology , then this prior can solve the riddle ( as pointed out in m11 ) .",
    "this is scenario is discussed in more detail later in ",
    "[ sub : sap ] .",
    "however , to date , relatively few targets have had asteroseismology studies conducted .",
    "we are therefore left with the quandary that it is usually impossible to say anything empirical about the orbital eccentricity of a transiting planet through photometry alone .",
    "we here present a solution for solving this riddle , which is applicable for multiple transiting planet systems . although this may seem limited in application , in fact nearly 50% of all transiting planet candidates discovered by _",
    "kepler _ are in multi - planet systems @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : multis ] provides the most recent statistics on multiple - planet systems from _",
    "kepler_. with this point established , we will now outline our proposed method .",
    "the n - map mcmc stage stopped when @xmath15 trials had been accepted , using 1% jump sizes for all six free parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "mixing was checked by evaluating the effective lengths of all free parameters from the non - burnt trials , and we found the lowest effective length was 1116 for parameter @xmath16 . in order to keep only @xmath22 points in the figures ,",
    "the chain was again evenly down - sampled .",
    "the results , shown in figure  [ fig : histosc]&[fig : nmapc ] , appear similar to those of koi - s0 g (  [ sub : koi - s0 g ] ) , which is to be expected given the fact both cases are consistent with a triply - circular system .",
    "the results again reflect a range of solutions consistent with circular orbits .              if we had not used n - map but assumed uniform priors in @xmath26 , the probability that @xmath27 ( which is a useful rough limit for a habitable world ) would be 30% and the probability that @xmath28 would be 70% .",
    "therfore it would be @xmath29 times more likely that the orbit was @xmath27 than otherwise .",
    "the same is of course true for @xmath18 and @xmath20 . using n - map",
    "these odds ratios become 5.8 , 6.8 and 5.0 for @xmath27 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , demonstrating the extra information we have gained from using n - map ."
