    "the problem of information spreading among a population has been intensively studied in the last years and several aspects have been focused upon @xcite .    the population is generally represented by means of a graph such that an interaction ( link ) between two or more agents ( nodes ) means that there is a flow of information among them .",
    "recently , the dynamics of agents making up the population has also been taken into account @xcite . not only does the mobility of agents provide a realistic feature , but it also affects the network of acquaintances .    in an earlier paper @xcite we introduced a model where agents are represented by @xmath0 random walkers which diffuse on a square @xmath6 lattice and",
    "possibly interact if they are close together .",
    "this model also takes into account the degradation of information when passing from one agent to another : a decay constant @xmath7 quantifies such alteration . as a consequence ,",
    "the information spreading is a history - dependent process which is governed by the rules underlying the diffusion of @xmath0 random walkers on the given space .",
    "indeed , diffusion phenomena are dramatically affected by the topology of the underlying space @xcite .",
    "for example , on infinite lattices , the asymptotic probability for a random walker to return to its starting point equals @xmath8 in one and two dimensions , while for @xmath9 there is a non - null probability to never return to the starting point .",
    "the former case is said to be _ recurrent _ , while the latter is called _ transient _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , in many processes concerning _ interacting _ random walkers , dimension 2 plays the role of an upper critical dimension : it separates a higher - dimensional regime where the mean - field results are exact from a lower - dimensional regime where fluctuations become important .",
    "this is the case , for example , for two - species diffusion - limited reactions @xcite , or for the trapping of a random walker by diffusing traps @xcite . in such processes ,",
    "additional logarithmic corrections for the power laws in dimension @xmath3 typically appear .",
    "hence , in general , when dealing with diffusion one should also wonder how the laws describing the problem are affected by the geometry .",
    "the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3 is now extended to @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattices .",
    "numerical simulations are carried for dimensions from @xmath10 up to @xmath11 .",
    "analytical investigations are led which especially focus on the one - dimensional case and on a mean - field approach which provides good estimates for high - dimensional ( @xmath9 ) lattices .",
    "most of the results presented here do also hold for general euclidean ( i.e. , translationally invariant ) lattices , since the large - scale topology of these systems ( and quantities depending on it , such as the time @xmath2 defined below in the low - density limit ) depends solely on their dimension , and not on small - scale details .",
    "the main important quantities we are concerned with are the population - awareness time @xmath2 , which represents the average time necessary for the piece of information to reach the whole population , and the final degree of information per agent @xmath12 .",
    "the time @xmath2 depends on the system parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "our numerical results show that in the low - density regime , and in every dimension @xmath1 , this dependence can be factorized as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in the low - density regime , we find the asymptotic behaviors of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 to agree with mean - field calculations for @xmath18 , while for @xmath19 deviations from the mean - field behavior appear and for @xmath20 the results are radically different .",
    "we therefore argue that dimension @xmath3 is marginal for the phenomenon under examination , and the mean field calculation of @xmath2 is exact for @xmath21 .",
    "the most important result contained in ref .",
    "@xcite concerns a nonasymptotic phenomenon : the nonmonotonic dependence of the final degree of information per agent @xmath22 on @xmath0 and @xmath5 , with the emergence of extremal points .",
    "a process of optimization of the final information is therefore intrinsically nontrivial .",
    "we show here that the existence of extremal points is not a consequence of the special choice @xmath3 , but it arises in all dimensions @xmath23 .",
    "it therefore appears as a _",
    "universal _ and geometry - independent phenomenon , occurring at the crossover between high- and low - density regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] is devoted to the description of the model .",
    "section  [ sec : analytical ] contains analytical results ; it is divided into high - density calculations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iiia ] ) ; low - density calculations for @xmath10 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iiib ] ) ; low - density calculations for @xmath24 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iiic ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : numres ] shows results obtained by means of numerical simulations .",
    "we first consider the population awareness time @xmath2 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] ) , then the behavior of the final degree of information and the quantities that affects it ( secs .",
    "[ sec : num_pop ] ,  [ sec : fininfo ] ) . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] includes our conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the model analyzed in this work represents an extension of the one introduced in an earlier paper @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly recall how it works .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath0 random walkers ( agents ) moving on a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice sized @xmath5 and endowed with periodic boundary condition .",
    "agents are initially ( @xmath25 ) distributed randomly throughout the whole volume @xmath26 .",
    "we define the density of agents as @xmath27 ; the `` low - density '' regime is for @xmath28 and the `` high - density '' regime for @xmath29 . at each following instant",
    "each agent jumps randomly to one of the @xmath30 nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "notice that the same site can be occupied by more agents , i.e , there are no excluded - volume effects .    at @xmath25",
    "we assume that only one agent ( called `` information source '' ) carries information , while the remaining @xmath31 agents are unaware .",
    "two agents can then interact if their distance on the underlying lattice is @xmath32 and if one of them is informed and the other unaware . by `` interaction '' we mean",
    "an information passing from the informed agent , say @xmath33 , to the unaware one @xmath34 with a fixed decay constant @xmath7 ( @xmath35 ) : if @xmath33 carries information @xmath36 , then @xmath34 becomes informed with information @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the information carried by agent @xmath33 is represented by the quantity @xmath36 , @xmath38 , and , in particular , when @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) the agent is `` aware '' ( `` unaware '' ) .",
    "once an agent has become informed , it will never change nor lose its information . as a consequence",
    ", there exists a final time @xmath41 at which the total information of the system can no longer evolve : at this time the information has reached every agent and the simulation stops .",
    "such time is a stochastic quantity with average value @xmath2 called the population - awareness time ( pat ) and standard deviation denoted as @xmath42 .",
    "part of this work is devoted to studying the properties of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "the total number of informed agents at a given time @xmath43 is again a stochastic variable ; we call @xmath44 its average over all the realizations of the system [ @xmath45 ; @xmath46 . as a result of our model ,",
    "the information carried by an agent is always a power @xmath47 of the decay constant , @xmath48 being the number of passages from the information source to the agent .",
    "it is convenient to divide informed agents into levels , so that an agent belongs to level @xmath48 when the information it receives has undergone @xmath48 passages from the information source and equals @xmath47 .",
    "we call @xmath49 the number of agents belonging to the @xmath48th level at time @xmath43 , averaged over all different realizations [ @xmath50 .",
    "the average total information at time @xmath43 is therefore the generating function of @xmath44 , @xmath51 in particular , we are interested in the final degree of information @xmath52 , that is the total information achieved once the whole population has been informed , @xmath53 we also denote its average value per agent as @xmath54 .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 as a function of @xmath48 is called the final distribution of the population on levels .",
    "although the model can not be exactly solved in the general case , it is possible to provide approximate solutions in some limit cases .",
    "there are two time scales involved in the process : one for the diffusion of the random walkers and one for the information passing .",
    "when they are very different , approximate analytical approaches become feasible and give results in good agreement with the numerical simulations . when the two time scales are comparable , only a numerical approach is possible ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numres ] ) .    in this section",
    "we give analytical results for the pat and the final distribution on levels in two limit cases .",
    "section  [ sec : iiia ] treats the high - density ( @xmath56 ) limit , with particular regard to the case @xmath10 .",
    "section  [ sec : iiib ] considers the asymptotic low - density ( @xmath57 ) limit for @xmath10 .",
    "a general mean - field theory of this limit for all dimensions is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : iiic ] .",
    "when @xmath29 , we can assume that the set of informed agents covers a connected volume of the lattice , and that this volume expands with a constant velocity ( depending on the density @xmath58 and dimension @xmath1 ) .",
    "we clarify this statement by considering @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider a chain of finite length @xmath5 , with @xmath59 agents on it , and label the sites with the numbers from 1 to @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : highd_1d ] ) .",
    "the number of agents on a given site is @xmath58 ; for @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , the probability that a given site is empty is 0 .",
    "also , for @xmath60 , we assume that with probability 1 at least one of the @xmath58 agents of a given site will jump to the left _ and _ one to the right .",
    "let the source be in @xmath61 at @xmath62 : all the agents in @xmath61 , @xmath8 , and @xmath63 will get informed . at @xmath64",
    "some of the newly informed agents jump on @xmath65 ; hence , the agents on @xmath66 and @xmath67 become informed .",
    "the motion of the information front decouples from the random motion of the agents ; it expands with a _",
    "law , with constant velocity of 4 sites per time unit .",
    "the time required to cover the whole chain is then @xmath68 the border of the informed zone contains all the newly - informed agents , so each time step adds a new level and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "this is the origin , for high densities , of the plateau observed in the one - dimensional distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distr_1d_arrow ] ) .    for @xmath24 it can be shown ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the case @xmath3 ) that the volume of the informed zone is a @xmath1-dimensional polyhedron .",
    "the time it takes the border of the informed volume to reach the border of the lattice is again @xmath71 , but now @xmath71 more instants are required to cover the rest of the lattice .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath72 the new agents added at each step cover a @xmath73-dimensional surface , hence @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for @xmath48 up to @xmath77 .",

    "[ fig : lowd_1d ] ) .",
    "the average distance among two agents is @xmath79 . due to the low - density hypothesis",
    ", we can neglect interactions involving more than two agents . in this approach",
    "we divide the problem of diffusion among @xmath0 agents into a sum of easier ( three - bodies ) problems .",
    "let us consider the instant @xmath80 when the rightmost agent @xmath81 informs an unaware agent @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowd_1d ] ) .",
    "let us call @xmath83 the next unaware agent on the right : the average distance from @xmath83 to @xmath81 and @xmath82 is @xmath84 ( if @xmath58 is small enough , we can consider @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be on the same site ) .",
    "a calculation regarding an epidemic model in one dimension similar to ours @xcite found that for low densities the velocity of the front propagation approaches @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the average time it takes one of the two aware agents to meet the unaware one is @xmath86 .",
    "if we now suppose that @xmath83 has been first reached by @xmath82 , it will take again a time @xmath87 for one of them to reach the next unaware agent @xmath88 on the right , and so on .",
    "there are about @xmath89 processes of this kind on the right - hand side and @xmath89 on the left - hand side , which provides    @xmath90    now , if @xmath81 belongs to level @xmath48 ( @xmath82 to level @xmath91 ) , @xmath83 will belong to levels @xmath91 or @xmath92 with probabilities @xmath93 ; @xmath88 will belong to levels @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath94 with probabilities @xmath95 , @xmath93 , and @xmath95 , respectively , and so on .",
    "it is easy to show by induction , starting from a source on level 0 , that at the @xmath96th information passing the new agent on the left - hand side is on level @xmath48 with probability @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) ; the same for the new agent on the right - hand side .",
    "hence , the average final number of agents on level @xmath48 is @xmath99 there is no easy closed form for this sum , but it can be plotted for any value of @xmath0 : the curve displays a plateau of height 2 , before decaying to 0 .",

    "we adopt a mean - field approximation by assuming that the agents between each event have the time to redistribute randomly on the lattice . in this approximation , the probability that two given agents are in contact at a given time is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the average time for two random walkers to meet on a @xmath1-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "+ the process is an absorbing markov chain with @xmath0 states ; the system is in state @xmath34 when it has @xmath34 informed agents .",
    "the chain starts from state 1 and evolves to the absorbing state ( state @xmath0 ) .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath105 can be written : the transition probability from a state @xmath34 to a state @xmath106 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath107 is @xmath108^{m - k}\\left[\\left(1-p_d\\right)^k\\right]^{n - m}\\ ] ] for any @xmath0 and @xmath107 .",

    "notice that minimum depth is greater for the latter case .",
    "error on data points is @xmath190.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us firstly consider the dependence on the decay constant @xmath7 .",
    "again , results highlight strong differences between the one - dimensional and higher - dimensional cases ( @xmath191 ) . in the latter case and for the low - density regime ( approximately @xmath192 )",
    ", we find @xmath193 within the error ( @xmath194 ) .    on the other hand , when @xmath10 , the final degree of information shows an exponential growth which can be represented by the following equation : @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 smoothly depend on @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : info_ld ] ) and ( [ eq : info_ld_1d ] ) are in very good agreement with the expressions found in the mean - field approximation [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hdil_info ] ) and ( [ eq : info_1d_anal ] ) , respectively ] .",
    "once @xmath7 is fixed , @xmath12 depends nonmonotonically on @xmath0 and @xmath5 : let us follow it for @xmath0 fixed and varying @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : info ] in the two cases @xmath10 and @xmath135 . for @xmath5 small , due to the narrow distribution discussed in the preceding section , the value of the information is high .",
    "when @xmath177 , the population distribution on levels reaches its extremal form and the information displays a minimum . as @xmath5 increases ,",
    "the information starts to rise again ( as can be seen , the effect gets more marked by increasing the dimension ) .",
    "hence , given a population number @xmath0 , there is an optimal lattice size @xmath181 for which the final information is minimum .",
    "the same happens having fixed @xmath5 and letting @xmath0 vary : there is a minimum for @xmath198 , depending on @xmath5 . as underlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of a local minimum of the final information implies that choosing an optimization strategy for the spreading of information on the lattice is not trivial .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ right direction in parameter space where to move in order to improve @xmath52 ; rather , the direction depends on the starting point .",
    "in this work the model of information spreading previously introduced has been extended to different geometries ; indeed , we considered the chain and @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattices .",
    "the occurrence of a nonmonotonic behavior for the final degree of information is not due to a special geometry underlying the process , but its origin lies in the crossover between the two different regimes of high and low density .",
    "therefore , the existence of minima in the final degree of information is universal and , remarkably , even the possibility to derive optimization strategies does not depend on the particular structure the process is embedded in .    on the other hand , the asymptotic laws for @xmath2",
    "are interestingly related to the geometry underlying the random - walk diffusion . in particular",
    ", @xmath3 is a marginal dimension separating two well - behaved cases , which suggests an investigation on in - between dimensions @xcite .",
