    "evidence from galactic rotation curves as well as bullet cluster collisions have strongly suggested the existence of dark matter(dm ) . however",
    "the nature of dm is unknown . in theory there",
    "exist many candidates for dm , the most popular of them being the case of weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the wimp scenario is realized in many models , with neutralino in supersymmetric theories being the most well studied of them .",
    "however , there also exists the possibility of dm interacting electromagnetically with standard model ( sm ) particles@xcite .",
    "we refer to this model of dm interactions as dipolar dm model .",
    "the dipolar dm model assumes that dark matter couples to photons through loops to give rise to electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "here we study the case in which dm particles are dirac fermions .",
    "the effective lagrangian for such a dm particle interacting with an electromagnetic field ( @xmath3 ) through its electric dipole moment ( @xmath4 ) and magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath5 ) is    @xmath6    here we consider this particular scenario in the context of dm detection in so called beam dump experiments also known as fixed target experiments . complimenting the searches from direct and indirect detection experiments , beam dump experiments feature a high energy beam incident on a fixed target .",
    "the dm particles produced from this collision are then detected in a suitable detector . in this work",
    "we particularly focus on the e613 experiment at fermilab in which a 400 gev proton beam is incident on a tungsten target with the resultant dm produced from the annihilation of beam proton and target proton being detected in a lead detector after passing through iron shielding .",
    "the advantage over direct detection in such experiments is that of higher luminosity .",
    "but the reach of such experiments and in particular of e613 is restricted to low mass dm due to the kinematics of fixed target experiments .",
    "future experiments like the new fixed target facility proposed at the cern sps called ship ( search for hidden particles ) @xcite can explore this possibility .",
    "the possibility of dm detection at beam dump experiments has been studied in the case of light mediators in the dark sector mediating dm interactions with sm particles @xcite and also in the case of @xmath7 as the mediating particle @xcite . more recently a similar model with dark vector boson was studied in the context of e613 @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach in @xcite and study the constraints on the dipolar dm model from e613 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the method for calculating the production cross section of dipolar dm when the 400 gev proton beam strikes the tungsten target . in section 3",
    "we describe the deep inelastic scattering that takes place between the dm and the lead target nuclei . in section 4",
    "we give the results from analysing the dipolar dm in the case of e613 and compare constraints from other experiments .",
    "finally we conclude in section 5 .",
    "here we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite . in a beam dump experiment like e613 , dm particles are produced through t - channel annihilation process from constituent quarks of protons in the beam and the target nucleus . in case of the e613",
    "we have a 400 gev proton beam striking a tungsten target .",
    "the dm particles are produced from the process , @xmath8 .",
    "the cross section for this hard process is calculated by incorporating the lagrangian in eq.([lag ] ) into madgraph 5 @xcite using feynrules @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath9 s produced is then given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number density of nucleons inside the tungsten target , @xmath12 is the number of protons in the beam that are incident on the tungsten target and @xmath13 is the length of the tungsten target .",
    "the geometry of the e613 detector is such that only those dm particles are accepted for which the scattering angle @xmath14 @xcite . this is a conservative limit on the scattering angle compared to the detector acceptance in the original experiment where @xmath15 .",
    "thus we integrate eq.([dnde ] ) for @xmath16 to obtain dm distribution @xmath17 .",
    "following @xcite we place an energy cut of 20 gev as the minimum energy required to register an event in the detector . now in order to find the number of events we need to find scattering cross section of the dm produced in the experiment with the detector nuclei , having energy @xmath18 where @xmath19 gev .",
    "since these dm particles are produced in a collision with cm energy of @xmath20 gev , their scattering off the lead nuclei in the detector is deeply inelastic .",
    "the energetic dm particle therefore undergoes a deep inelastic scattering with the lead nucleus inside the detector via photon exchange .",
    "the dm couples to the photon through its electric / magnetic dipole moment . the initial dm momentum before scattering being @xmath21 while that after scattering being @xmath22 the momentum transfer carried by the photon is @xmath23 . now using the formalism of deep inelastic scattering of leptons we define the bjorken scaling variable @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the energy of the photon in the rest frame of the nucleus . with this the differential scattering cross section in terms of leptonic matrix element @xmath27 and hadronic matrix element @xmath28",
    "is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , with @xmath5 being the magnetic dipole moment of dm and for dm interacting via the electric dipole moment , @xmath31 .",
    "now the leptonic current for the magnetic dipole moment interaction of dm corresponding to the lagrangian in eq.([lag ] ) is @xmath32      -4\\mxx\\left(q^2\\gmunu+\\qmu\\qnu\\right )      \\label{lmdm}\\ ] ] and similarily for the electric dipole moment interaction we have @xmath32      \\label{ledm}\\ ] ]    the hadronic matrix element @xmath28 can be written in terms of structure functions such that we separate out contributions from longitudinally polarized photons and transversely polarized photons as @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34    at the lowest order in perturbation theory the structure function @xmath35 while @xmath36 .",
    "contracting the leptonic and hadronic tensors in eqs .",
    "( [ lmdm ] ) and ( [ wmunu ] ) we have for the magnetic dipole interaction    @xmath37\\sum\\limits_q",
    "xf_{q / a}(x , q^2 )      \\label{eq21}\\ ] ]    similarily for the electric dipole interaction we have @xmath38\\sum\\limits_q      xf_{q / a}(x , q^2 )      \\label{ed21}\\ ] ]    for the nuclear parton distribution functions we use those provided by hirai etal .",
    "the above expression when integrated over @xmath26 and @xmath39 gives the cross section for scattering of dm with nucleon inside the target .",
    "the limits of integration are as follows :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "in addition to the above limits one also has the upper limit @xmath43 which translates to @xmath44 . from the cross section",
    "so obtained we can now write the mean free path of the dm particle as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the number density of the nucleon inside the target material and @xmath47 is the scattering cross section of dm from a nucleon . the probability of a dm particle scattering inside the detector is then given by @xmath48 and for a dm particle that behaves like a wimp interacting through a weak dipole moment we can use the approximation @xmath49 .",
    "finally the number of expected events in the detector is @xmath50\\frac{dn}{de }      \\label{ndet}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the probability of dm scattering inside the lead detector and @xmath52 is that inside the iron shielding .",

    "from the number of events calculated using eq.([ndet ] ) , we constrain the magnetic and electric dipole moments of dm in the dm mass range of @xmath0 gev .",
    "we use the interpretation in @xcite also used in @xcite of the experimental data in @xcite .",
    "we allow only those values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for which the number of expected events is @xmath56 .",
    "the results for electric and magnetic dipole interactions of dm are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddm ] .",
    "we have also added the bound from l3 experiment at lep on the magnetic moment of dm @xcite .",
    "the bounds on electric and magnetic dipole moments of dm from the analysis of l3 experiment are @xmath57 e - cm or equivalently @xmath58 .",
    "we see from the figure that for electric dipole interaction of dm the allowed dm mass ranges between @xmath59 gev , however for the magnetic dipole case the dm mass lies between @xmath60 gev .",
    "in addition to the bound from l3 collaboration at lep , recently constraints from solar physics on dipolar dm and similar models have also been studied @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the bound on magnetic dipole moment of dm from helioseismological data is estimated to be @xmath61 e - cm , for dm mass @xmath62 gev , which is quite similar to the bound from l3 collaboration . also for momentum and/or velocity",
    "dependent scattering of dm studied in @xcite which is relevant for dipolar dm model since it also has momentum and velocity dependence , the most favorable dm mass is found to be @xmath63 gev .",
    "thus we see that the constraints from beam dump experiments are in broad agreement with those from solar physics .",
    "also the most stringent bounds from direct detection currently come from lux collaboration @xcite , however this bound is considerably weak for low mass dm particularly in the @xmath0 gev range . as a result",
    "this bound is inconsequential for the results presented here .",
    "we study the dipolar dm model in the context of e613 beam dump experiment .",
    "we see that the constraint on electric and magnetic dipole interactions of dm from e613 experiment for light dm in the @xmath0 gev mass range is quite stringent .",
    "it is restricted in that mass range mainly by the bound on magnetic dipole moment from the l3 collaboration at @xmath64 e - cm or @xmath65 .",
    "bounds from solar physics data are also broadly compatible with this mass range and dipole moment .",
    "thus the dipolar model of dm offers an alternative that is compatible with constraints from wide ranging experiments like beam dump or fixed target experiments as well as helioseismological data .",
    "in addition the low mass range of dm enables it to be compatible with the most stringent direct detection bounds from lux@xcite .",
