    "the idea to perform computation with the help of quantum mechanics dates back to feynman @xcite .",
    "research in this direction got a considerable acceleration after the realisation @xcite that quantum computers could solve in a polynomial time certain problems which require nonpolynomial time on classical computers .",
    "two main obstacles to a universal quantum computer are decoherence and scalability .",
    "decoherence , if sufficiently weak , can be dealt with by quantum error correcting codes , see ref.@xcite for an experimental implementation .",
    "scalability requires that a given technology can be upscaled to a quantum coherent circuit with hundreds or thousands of quantum gates , see ref.@xcite for reviews on various proposals of scalable implementations . at the present stage",
    "solid state implementations have most to offer from the point of view of scalability but at the same time they are most likely to suffer from decoherence .",
    "the aim of this note is to reduce decoherence in the persistent current qubit ( pcq ) proposal @xcite .    two remarkable experiments @xcite took place last year where a superconducting loop broken by josephson junctions was forced into states which are quantum superpositions of two states with opposite macroscopic persistent currents : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the two considered combinations @xmath2 were eigenstates separated by a gap of @xmath3 so it is not surprising that each of them does not suffer from decoherence at the temperature of @xmath4 .",
    "a more general superposition @xmath5 would quickly decohere into a mixed state @xmath6 parallel to the plane of the superconducting loop and penetrating through its thin layer , see fig.1 .",
    "[ design ]    = 6 cm    @xmath7 has to be less than the critical field in a type i superconducting film .",
    "if the @xmath8 nuclear spins are exposed to a magnetic field @xmath9 from the persistent current which is much weaker than @xmath7 , as can be characterized by a quality factor    @xmath10    then the entanglement between the qubit state and the spins state is negligible and leads to negligible _ partial decoherence_. the means which treat entanglement incidentally also reduce the latter random walk problem , which can be furter eliminated by increasing the spin relaxation time @xmath11 which depends exponentially on temperature .",
    "we begin with an elementary example where the qubit is coupled to just one environmental @xmath12 spin . for the purpose of this paper",
    "the spin-1/2 is a sufficient representation of the nuclear spin-9/2 of niobium .",
    "the spin is coupled to the external magnetic field @xmath7 ; its hamiltonian is    @xmath13    the current of the qubit induces a magnetic field which at the location of the environmental spin has strength @xmath9 . for the time being",
    "we assume that the field is perpendicular to the external field in , say , @xmath14-direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of interaction between the qubit and the spin is    @xmath15    the external magnetic field @xmath7 , which is in plane of the superconducting loop , does not couple to the qubit state . for the sake of simplicity we set the qubit hamiltonian @xmath16 , what does not change the general conclusion of this note .",
    "the initial state of @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a product    @xmath19 are @xmath20 eigenstates of @xmath21 . under the total hamiltonian @xmath22",
    "the initial @xmath23 evolves into    @xmath24    evolves into    @xmath25    where the overlap @xmath26 is given by    @xmath27    here @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is mixed when @xmath30 .",
    "the entanglement with a single spin is reversible because there are periodic revivals at the times when @xmath31 .",
    "we note that for @xmath32 the overlap @xmath26 remains @xmath33 and the qubit state stays pure .",
    "even just one environmental spin can lead to irreversible full decoherence when the spin interacts with its thermal bath . in the absence of the qubit , thermalisation of the spin density matrix @xmath34 towards @xmath35",
    "can be described by a master equation    @xmath36    where @xmath37",
    "are spin-@xmath12 lowering / raising operators and @xmath11 is the spin relaxation time of the order of minutes .",
    "this master equation can be formally unravelled by a stochastic evolution of the spin state .",
    "the spin state makes a down(up ) flip within time @xmath38 with a probability given by @xmath39 times the probability that the spin is in the @xmath40 state .",
    "the master equation describes evolution of an average over such stochastic trajectories of the spin state .",
    "let us apply this stochastic unravelling to the state of the spin and the qubit .",
    "the @xmath41 in eq.([psit ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath42 can be described as a projection of @xmath41 on @xmath43 followed by a spin flip + @xmath44 . as a result @xmath41 jumps to    @xmath45",
    "is @xmath39 times the probability that @xmath41 is in the @xmath46 state which is @xmath47 , where we assume @xmath48 .",
    "the probability is @xmath49 .",
    "the down transition is a projection on @xmath50 followed by a spin flip @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath41 jumps to    @xmath52 as compared to the initial system state ( [ psi0 ] ) .",
    "this sign flip also flips the sign of the off - diagonal elements in the reduced qubit density matrix , compare eqs.([rho0],[rhot ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath29 including spin relaxation is obtained after an average over stochastic trajectories .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath29 average to zero on a timescale of @xmath53 .",
    "this is the time of full decoherence due to spin relaxation .",
    "we note that for @xmath54 the time is much longer than @xmath11 .",
    "decoherence becomes more efficient when there are many copies of the environmental spin numbered by @xmath55 .",
    "interaction hamiltonians are @xmath56 .",
    "the initial product state    @xmath57    evolves into a @xmath41 such that the reduced state of the qubit has the form of eq.([rhot ] ) but with    @xmath58    where @xmath59 .",
    "the early time overlap is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath26 decays from @xmath33 on a timescale of @xmath62 . for @xmath63 different factors in eq.([prodo ] ) oscillate with different frequencies dispersed in the range @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 the phases of oscillating terms in different factors become effectively random and the overlap averages to    @xmath66    for @xmath67 the system state remains pure ; there is only a negligible partial decoherence .",
    "fig.2 shows @xmath26 for a sample of @xmath68 s at two different values of @xmath7 .",
    "[ overlap ]    = 6 cm    let us include spin relaxation .",
    "to get full decoherence it is enough that only one out of @xmath8 spins makes the down transition so the decoherence time is @xmath8 times shorter than for a single spin , @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 makes this decoherence time is much longer than @xmath11 .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the large @xmath17 limit with the case of @xmath71 when eq.([prodo ] ) gives    @xmath72    the different factors , which oscillate with frequencies in a range proportional to @xmath9 , go out of phase after a time of @xmath73 when the overlap averages to zero .",
    "for @xmath71 the time @xmath62 when @xmath26 decays away from @xmath33 is a time of full decoherence .",
    "so far we considered the single spin environment and the multispin environment with a fully polarized initial state .",
    "a thermal initial state is a weighted average over different partially polarized states , like e.g. @xmath74 .",
    "the overlap ( [ prodo ] ) is the same for any such partially polarized state as for the fully polarized state so the estimates of decoherence time for the polarized state go through unchanged for the thermal density matrix .",
    "the mixedness of the initial environmental state does matter when we finally take into account the @xmath75-component of the qubit magnetic field at the location of spins which gives an extra term in the interaction hamiltonian    @xmath76    this hamiltonian , when applied to a partially polarized spins state , gives @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a polarization of the @xmath79-th spin . if @xmath80 s were static , then this @xmath81 could be measured at the beginning of the quantum computation and balanced by a @xmath82-counterterm in the qubit hamiltonian , as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the problem is that @xmath80 s are not static because they flip at the rate of one spin per @xmath83 . the total polarization @xmath84 performs a random walk with one @xmath85 step every @xmath83 so that @xmath86 ^ 2}=4tn / t_r$ ] , where the overline means here an average over random walks .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath87 $ ] is random so the qubit states @xmath0 and @xmath1 accumulate opposite random phases @xmath88 , which grow as @xmath89 .",
    "they lead to full dephasing after a dephasing time @xmath90 . in this discussion",
    "we assume @xmath70 so that entanglement is negligible .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath7 is bounded from above by the critical field of the type i superconducting material @xmath91 .",
    "this parameter is the highest ( @xmath92 ) for niobium . in this respect niobium",
    "is much better than alluminium which has much lower @xmath93 .",
    "we choose niobium and set @xmath94 .",
    "there are materials like lead or tin that have abundant isotopes with zero nuclear spin .",
    "we do not consider them here because niobium and alluminium microtechnology is more advanced and , what is even more important , even lead or tin or their substrates would have spin impurities requiring environment engineering .    in the qubit design of ref.@xcite",
    "the @xmath95 superconducting loop is made of an alluminium @xmath96 wire with persistent current of @xmath97 .",
    "we suggest niobium instead of alluminium and the loop to be just @xmath98 thick .",
    "@xmath98 is roughly twice the penetration depth so that @xmath7 can penetrate through the superconductor .",
    "note that the critical field is higher in such thin films than in bulk superconductor @xcite .",
    "our superconducting loop will produce a flux of @xmath99 which is an order of magnitude less than in the design of ref.@xcite .",
    "the loop is also thinner so it contains fewer spins .",
    "the superconductor volume of @xmath100 contains @xmath101 of niobium nuclear spins .",
    "they are subject to an average @xmath102 .",
    "the quality factor @xmath103 gives the overlap @xmath104 .",
    "if the external field were @xmath71 , then full decoherence would take place after    @xmath105    where we assume the nuclear spin magnetic moment of @xmath106 . for our @xmath107 after @xmath108 we get only negligible partial decoherence with @xmath104 .",
    "the full decoherence due to spin relaxation could happen after    @xmath109    where we assume @xmath11 to be of the order of minutes , but the dephasing time    @xmath110    is much shorter .",
    "even this @xmath111 time can be significantly increased by decreasing temperature because @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the superconducting gap .",
    "reduction of temperature from @xmath4 down to @xmath114 increases @xmath115 25 times .",
    "maximalization of the quality factor @xmath116 so that @xmath70 makes entanglement with spin environment negligible .",
    "the same technique can be used for any qubit design which involves superposition of states with different magnetic fields . according to our estimates , the present day persistent current qubit proposal @xcite is not far from achieving a @xmath111 dephasing time due to the finite spin relaxation time @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath111 is sufficient for the planned quantum computation at a @xmath117 rate . to achieve this desired decoherence time",
    "it is important to replace alluminium by niobium and make the circuit more microscopic than in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is a common wisdom that more microscopic systems are better from the point of view of decoherence , compare e.g. our formula for @xmath108 .",
    "we showed that in addition to this much expected behaviour , there is a threshold below which a sufficiently microscopic qubit can be made free from entanglement with the spin bath .",
