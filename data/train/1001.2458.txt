    "the nuclear and circumnuclear activity of galaxies generally involves the interplay between a number of different components and phenomena , e.g. a central active source surrounded by an absorbing torus , a rotating central bulge , outflowing jets , flowing streams due to the action of a bar , or even merging . to separate these different components and derive their respective line ratios and kinematic",

    "the nad absorption in front of the nucleus appears to have a higher redshift than the average stellar template redshift , which also is indicated by the shape of the line residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "most remarkably the velocity dip to the east of the nucleus is larger for [ oiii ] than for the [ nii ] and h@xmath4 lines and apparently still larger for h@xmath5 . outside the dip [ oiii ] shows smaller rotational velocities than h@xmath4 and [ nii ] .",
    "here we ask ourselves , what additional information on the structure and ionization distribution in the nuclear region do these differences in velocity behaviour give us ?",
    "an explanation for the differences in velocity behaviour between the various emission lines would be that the whole central region consists of different gaseous components with different velocity behaviour , different excitation , and different dust absorption , and thus different sets of line ratios .",
    "when this region is smoothed by the psf , different distortions of the velocity field for the different lines will result .",
    "assume that the region considered covers @xmath9 pixels and contains @xmath10 separate structural components , each with its own line ratios and set of velocities .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the observed line intensities and velocities at pixel number @xmath13 of a line with wavelength @xmath0 , we have    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the intrinsic intensity , in the line @xmath0 , of the component @xmath17 at the pixel @xmath18 , and @xmath19 the corresponding velocity , which is supposed independent of @xmath0 , and @xmath20 the psf .",
    "if @xmath21 is the number of lines measured , we have in the general case @xmath22 unknown and @xmath23 equations . if the line ratios are all the same in the different components , equation ( [ eq : v ] ) is independent of @xmath0 . in the simplest case , where we only consider one component @xmath24",
    ", we have enough equations to solve for the unknown intensities and velocities for each @xmath0 , which can be made by clean - like algorithms ( hgbom 1974 ) .    in the general case",
    ", we do not have a sufficient number of equations to solve for the unknown intensities @xmath16 and velocities @xmath19 .",
    "if , however , we increase the number of lines measured and at the same time impose some conditions on the unknowns in terms of models , we may in principle be able to reach a solution .",
    "for instance , we see from equations ( [ eq : j ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) that if the line ratios @xmath25 depend on @xmath26 , i.e. , do vary from one component to another , then we have @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the differences between velocities from different spectral lines give us information about differing line ratios between different components .",
    "we will illustrate this for our spectrum of ngc  1358 .",
    "we will test velocity and intensity observations over the nuclear region against a scenario where the dip in the rotation curve is caused by an outflow of excited gas from a central source at rest with respect to a nuclear gaseous disk .",
    "we strive to have in this model an absolute minimum of free parameters to fit the observations .",
    "we will first demonstrate the simplest primitive model , here called model 1 , to motivate why we introduce our more elaborate models .",
    "our model 1 has the following features :    * a stellar bulge with a mass distribution corresponding to the continuum surface intensity distribution , giving the gravitational field in the nuclear region . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] the observed surface intensity distribution can be well represented by the sum of two exponential disks with scale lengths of 07 and 4  respectively and an intensity ratio of 4:1 , smoothed with the observed psf . to derive a likely potential and rotation curve for this stellar bulge we use the relation ( 2170 ) of binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) to give the potential of the sum of two exponential spheres with scale lengths 07 and 40 respectively , and a mass ratio of 4:1 in conformance with fig .  [ fig : continuum ] .",
    "although we note that routinely bulges are fitted by de vaucouleurs or sersic profiles , experience has shown that exponential profiles are satisfactory to parametrize a bulge ( e.g. , fathi & peletier 2003 , balcells et al .",
    "2007 ) , and certainly this seems also to be the case for ngc  1358 .",
    "this makes the total mass @xmath28 of the bulge the only free parameter of the bulge potential , where @xmath13 is the inclination of the plane of the emission line disk to the plane of the sky and we assume that the difference in pa between the slit and the line of nodes of the disk is small . * in the potential of this bulge there is a rotating emission line disk . to avoid edge problems we assume this disk to be exponential and rotate with circular velocities .",
    "as the intensities of the disk is low compared to the other features , the exact scale length is not crucial , and we fix it ad hoc to 40 .",
    "then the only free parameters are the central surface line intensities of the emission line disk . * a central emission line point source coinciding with the center of the bulge and the emission line disk and at rest with respect to that center . * a gas flow ,",
    "here called the `` jet '' , seen from the nucleus out to 7 pixels ( 18 ) from the nucleus with constant line of sight velocity @xmath29  with respect to the point source , which was the velocity of the fainter component relative to the stronger as seen in the hst / stis spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sii ] ) .",
    "the resulting intensities and velocities are convolved with the observed psf as derived from a field star on the slit ( fig .",

    "the line of sight velocity , or redshift , of the central source and disk is an open question .",

    "rice et al .",
    "( 2006 ) assume a systematic redshift of 4008 , and their spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sii ] ) shows a line of sight velocity of @xmath31  for the stronger nuclear component with respect to the 4008  systemic velocity , i.e. a nuclear redshift of 4153  for the stronger component and 3939  for the blueshifted weaker component .",
    "we prefer to make the systemic velocity of the nuclear disk and the central emission source a free parameter in our model .",
    "the additional free parameters are the intensities of the central source and along the jet for each emission line .",
    "the fit of this preliminary model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : badmodel ] .",
    "as can be seen , this model can not reproduce the very sharp rise of the emission line velocity curves at the end of the jet about 2  to the east of the center .",
    "thus , we feel forced to introduce a sharp shock at the end of the jet and a postshock cloud .      this model has the following features :    * a stellar bulge identical with the bulge in model 1 presented above , where the total mass @xmath28 of the bulge is the only free parameter . * in the potential of this bulge a rotating exponential emission line disk similar to the one in model 1 , again with a scale length of 40 and the only free parameters are the central surface line intensities . * a central emission line point source coinciding with the centra of the bulge and the emission line disk and at rest with respect to that center . * a gas flow ,",

    "we introduce a sharp shock , with a jump to more positive velocities , and in the following pixels , up to pixel 8 , a postshock cloud with constant velocity .",
    "the mean velocity in the shock pixel is given some intermediate velocity between those of the jet and the postshock cloud .",
    "the resulting intensities and velocities are convolved with the observed psf as derived from a field star on the slit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] ) .    still , in this way we have tried to keep the free parameters to a minimum , and the free parameters of this model , to be fitted to the observations , are :    1 .",
    "the total mass @xmath28 of the bulge .",

    "these parameters are varied until a reasonable fit to the observed velocities and intensities have been obtained .",
    "the fit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] .",
    "the shock is placed within pixel 5 with the intermediate velocity of @xmath32 .",
    "this determines the postshock cloud velocity to about + 100 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] , the line intensities of [ oiii ] and the velocities in the jet are not perfectly fitted , and to place the shock short of pixel 5 makes the situation worse .",
    "further , it can be seen from the observations that the emission lines have long faint wings on the western ( negative ) side , actually h@xmath4 and [ nii ] stretching furthest and [ oiii ] having the shortest wing .",
    "the run of the h@xmath4 and [ nii ] velocities on the west side show that the main intensities of this extended emission come from the rotating disk .",
    "this indicates an asymmetry in the emission line disk , and this makes it difficult with the present model to fit the velocities away from the center simultaneously on both sides , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] . due to the jet",
    ", the observed velocities on the left side are more influenced by the inner part of the disk , and on the right side by the outer part .",
    "we can then introduce an asymmetry of the observations without abandoning the circular symmetry of the disk by describing its surface intensity as the sum of two superposed exponential disks with widely different scale lengths and varying their central intensities independently .",
    "this results in differences in the line ratios , simulating a gradient of these ratios within the disk .",
    "this leads us to the next model .",
    "this model is the final one which gives us the best fit to the observed velocities and intensities in the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "its features are :    * a stellar bulge identical with the bulge in model 1 presented above , where the total mass @xmath28 of the bulge is the only free parameter . * in the potential of this bulge there is a rotating emission line disk .",
    "we assume the intensities in the disk to be the sum of two exponential disks with differing scale lengths . as the intensities of the disk are low compared to the other features , the exact scale lengths are not crucial , and we fix them ad hoc to 07 and 40 ( only for historical reasons the same as for the bulge ) .",

    "the h@xmath5 intensities are too weak and uncertain to give a unique solution in the present case .",
    "our `` best fit '' model  3 resolves the nuclear structure of ngc  1358 into    * a central unresolved emission line source ( the nucleus ) , * a 15 long jet emerging from the nucleus with a line of sight velocity of @xmath39 , * a spherical nuclear stellar bulge containing a rotating emission line disk , inclined to the stellar kinematic symmetry plane of the bulge , * an emission line region , the postshock cloud , at the end of the jet , and after a drastic jump in velocity .    with the emission line fluxes for these structures we are able to set up the starburst - agn diagnostic diagrams introduced by baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 ) and veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineratios ] shows the diagnostic diagram log  [ oiii]/h@xmath5 versus log  [ nii]/h@xmath4 where the [ oiii]/h@xmath5 ratio is derived from [ oiii]/h@xmath4 assuming large optical depth , referred to as case b described in chapter 4.2 of osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "accordingly , for an electron temperature of 10000 k , the h@xmath4/h@xmath5 is 2.87 , which we note is not much different from the case when the gas is assumed to be optically thin . as evident , the nuclear source and the jet fall in the region of highly excited agns , while the inner disk and the postshock cloud fall close to the region of low ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) .",
    "the ratios [ nii]/h@xmath4 places the outer part of the nuclear disk and the spiral arms in the hii region domain .",
    "the contribution from the underlying h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 absorption lines only change the derived emission line ratios marginally .",
    "however , the effect of reddening has not been taken into account in the emission ratios presented in fig .",

    "the nuclear point source shows the highest excitation .",
    "if h@xmath5 would be included in this analysis , its derived true intensity in the nuclear point source would with h@xmath4 give the true absorption of the nuclear source of this seyfert  2 galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath5 is much too faint and uncertain to be fitted with our procedure .",
    "stronger exposed h@xmath5 would be needed .",
    "the emission line map of dumas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) shows that the maximum intensity for our jet lies in about pa 130 , and there is also a fainter counter - jet in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , our slit avoids the maximum intensity of the jet and also the counter - jet . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , this means that there is no need for a counter - jet in our model .",
    "however , disk  1 which is completely drowned on he east side by the jet , may in reality correspond to a trace of an absorbed counter - jet .",
    "its position fin fig .",
    "[ fig : lineratios ] does not contradict this .",
    "on the other hand , the introduction of a counter - jet in our model would add a number of uncertain intensity parameters .    the hst / stis spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sii ] ) indicates a high density for the jet , and the jet intensity maps display a bent spiral - like morphology consistent with a precessing jet flow . considering the angle of about 45  between the jet axis and our slit ,",
    "the jet may be surrounded by a more widespread outflow , similar to the one observed in the nucleus of the seyfert  1.5 galaxy ngc  1365 ( hjelm & lindblad 1996 ) .",
    "moran et al . ( 2000 ) conclude that ngc  1358 belongs to the class of about 50  % seyfert  2s that do not contain a polarized broad line region ( npbl  sy2 ) .",
    "shu et al . ( 2007 ) argue that npbl sy2s can be interpreted in the framework of the agn unified model if the absorption column density is higher at large inclinations and the scattering region is absorbed at large inclinations .",
    "thus , the inclination of the jet to the line of sight may be large and the outflow motion considerably higher than 214 .",
    "the emission line disk intensities are completely hidden behind the strong features in the central part and too faint to be measured at larger distances from the center .",
    "they are therefore completely determined by the influence of this disk on the observed total velocities .",
    "disks 1 and 2 represent the inner and outer parts , respectively , of this nuclear emission line disk .",
    "their line ratios then indicate a rather strong gradient within the nuclear disk ( see table  [ tab : modelvalues ] ) , or , as mentioned , a difference in line ratios between an eventual absorbed counter - jet and disk  2 .",
    "the disk rotates in the potential of the stellar bulge at an angle to the kinematic symmetry plane of the bulge .",
    "our slit is oriented close to the kinematic major axis of the disk , but close to the kinematic minor axis of the stellar bulge ( dumas et al .",
    "the redshift of the central source in our model and the systematic redshift of the stellar bulge differ with about 100 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : observedemission ] , may be accounted for if our slit misses the central peak passing about 1  to the south of the nucleus .",
    "this would mean that our derived rotation curve is somewhat flatter than the true one and the intensities of the central source too faint .",
    "the nad absorption lines , measured with splot , show the same systematic redshift as the emission lines , which would imply that their main absorption comes from the emission line disk and not from the stellar bulge .",
    "the negative mean velocity of the spiral arms speaks somewhat against this miscentering view with whatever weight this may have .",
    "we want to stress that our method , i.a . because of the necessity to introduce number of more or less reasonable assumptions in order to decrease the number of free parameters , does not give a unique solution to the nuclear structure of ngc 1358 .",
    "the differing velocities in the different lines give strong constraints for the line ratios .",
    "experiments with our model , for example , shows that it is the weakness of [ oiii ] in the postshock cloud and nuclear disk that causes the dip in velocity of the eastern part of the velocity curve to be deeper in [ oiii ] , and the [ oiii ] velocity curve to be flatter on both sides .",
    "but , it is necessary to know with good precision the outer wings of the psf in order to account for the influence of the strong components on the fainter ones .    in our particular case",
    "the main draw back is that the observations are restricted to a single slit . to get all necessary information about the velocities and spatial distribution of the different components from an isolated spectrum is futile , because of the very limited coverage and the unknown influence due to the point spread function from sources outside the slit . by adding more slits",
    ", there is still a difficulty to obtain an accurate and complete coverage ( lindblad et al .",
    "obviously , the ideal is an integral field spectrometer and an extension of the method to a two - dimensional treatment , combined with comprehensive statistical analysis , covering the entire region of interest .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that , with this analysis , we have made a step towards a resolution of the nuclear region of ngc  1358 into a number of different components with different velocity behaviour and excitation , where a summary of the results are seen in fig .",

    "<S> , the observed kinematics differs for different spectral lines . from the observed intensity and velocity distributions of a number of spectral lines , and with some reasonable assumptions about structure of different subcomponents to diminish the number of free parameters , the true line ratios and velocity structures may be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary solution for the nuclear structure of ngc  1358 is obtained , involving a nuclear point source and an emerging outflow of high excitation , ending with shock and postshock cloud as revealed by the velocities , as well as a nuclear emission line disk rotating in the potential of a stellar bulge and expressing a radial excitation gradient . the method results in a likely scenario for the nuclear structure of the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  1358 . for definitive results an extrapolation of the method to two dimensions combined with the use of integral field spectroscopy will be necessary . </S>"
