    "the guiding of matter waves in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and light in optical waveguides @xcite , using effective potentials which are induced by optical lattices or photonic crystals , has drawn a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "such settings play a crucial role in the creation and stabilization of ordinary and gap solitons ref1,ref3 , ref4 , supported by the balance of the diffraction , lattice - induced potentials , and self - focusing or defocusing nonlinearity , respectively .",
    "in addition to linear lattices , many works have been dealing with their nonlinear counterparts ( the spatial modulation of the local nonlinearity coefficient ) @xcite-@xcite and combined linear - nonlinear antivk-@xcite lattices .",
    "the nonlinear lattices may be realized , severally in optics and becs , by means of properly designed photonic - crystals structures , or nonlinearity landscapes induced by the feshbach resonance controlled by nonuniform external fields .",
    "a recent noteworthy result is the existence of stable bright solitons in self - defocusing ( sdf ) @xmath2-dimensional media with the strength of the cubic nonlinearity growing toward the periphery , as a function of radius @xmath3 , at any rate faster than @xmath4 @xcite .    along with the cubic nonlinearity",
    ", quintic terms appear in various physical settings too . in optics ,",
    "the quintic nonlinearity was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed in fluids ref18 , ref19 and glasses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in the context of bec , the quintic nonlinearity represents three - body interactions in a dense condensate , provided that collision - induced losses may be neglected ref15 .",
    "the self - focusing quintic nonlinearity is critical in 1d , similar to its cubic counterpart in 2d case @xcite , i.e. , it gives rise to a degenerate family of _ townes solitons _",
    "@xcite , with a single value of the norm for the entire family . in the free space ,",
    "the townes solitons are unstable , but they can be readily stabilized by linear potentials , as demonstrated in 1d @xcite-@xcite and 2d bbb , ref3 settings alike .",
    "the use of nonlinear potentials for the same purpose turns out to be tricky : in the 2d space with the cubic self - focusing , only nonlinearity - modulation profiles with _",
    "sharp edges _ are able to stabilize the townes solitons in a limited parameter region sharp , ref4 . in the 1d system with the quintic nonlinearity , nonlinear lattices with a _ smooth _",
    "( sinusoidal ) modulation profile stabilize the respective townes solitons against the critical collapse , but only in a narrow region @xcite .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that the 1d tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas of bosons with the hard - core repulsion , emulating a degenerate fermi gas , obeys the 1d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the quintic sdf term ( an additional nonlocal cubic interaction appears if the bosons carry dipole moments @xcite ) . while this equation is inappropriate for the description of dynamical effects caused by interference of bosonic wavepackets @xcite , it correctly predicts stationary patterns in the trapped gas @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the tg gas was realized in an ultracold gas of @xmath5rb loaded into a tightly confined potential pipe @xcite .",
    "in fact , the  quantum newton s cradle \" , realized in a trapped chain of @xmath6rb atoms @xcite , is another example of the tg gas .    in this work ,",

    "term whose local strength grows fast enough at @xmath7 ( in fact , the solitons exist for the growth rates faster than @xmath8 ) .",
    "these results generalize those recently reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite for",
    "sdf media with the modulated cubic nonlinearity , and thus demonstrate the genericity of the method for creating robust bright solitons using solely the sdf nonlinearity .",

    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ g2d ] ) below , for which some soliton solutions can be obtained in an exact analytical form , and generic ones are constructed numerically .",
    "the family of the fundamental solitons is completely stable , similar to the situation reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite in the case of the spatially modulated cubic sdf nonlinearity .",
    "we give an additional argument , based on energy estimates , in favor of the conjecture that the fundamental solitons may realize the system s ground state . in terms of the dependence between the soliton s propagation constant and norm , @xmath9 , the bright solitons in the sdf medium obey the _ inverted _ vakhitov - kolokolov ( alias _ anti - vk _ antivk ) criterion , @xmath10 , on the contrary to the usual vk criterion for fundamental solitons in self - focusing media , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it appears that , as conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anti - vk criterion is a necessary but , in the general case , not sufficient condition for the stability of bright solitons supported by sdf nonlinearities .",
    "higher - order 1d solitons , whose shapes feature different numbers of nodes ( @xmath12 ) , are found too .",
    "a part of the soliton family with @xmath13 is stable , while all the modes with @xmath14 are found to be unstable .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the model considered here , as well as its previously studied counterpart with the cubic nonlinearity ref13,ref13 - 2 , is not integrable .",
    "indeed , it was proven ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the nls equation in 1d with any nonlinearity different from pure cubic is nonintegrable , hence our quintic model is definitely nonintegrable too . for this reason ,",
    "the localized modes , that we study in this paper , are not  solitons \" in the rigorous mathematical meaning of the word , but rather  solitary waves \" .",
    "nevertheless , we call the modes  solitons \" , following the usage commonly adopted in the current literature . in this work",
    ", we do not study interactions between the solitons , as multi - soliton configurations trapped in the nonlinear potential well are less relevant than single - soliton states .",
