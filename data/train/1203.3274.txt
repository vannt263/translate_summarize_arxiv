    "in general , collective herding behavior poses interesting problems in several cross fields such as sociology @xcite , social psychology @xcite , ethnology @xcite@xcite , and economics .",
    "statistical physics offers effective tools to analyze these phenomena caused by collective herding behaviors , and the associated field is known as sociophysics @xcite .",
    "for example , in statistical physics , anomalous fluctuations in financial markets @xcite@xcite and opinion dynamics @xcite@xcite@xcite have been related to percolation and the random field ising model .",
    "to estimate public perception , people observe the actions of other individuals ; then , they make a choice similar to that of others . because it is usually sensible to do what other people are doing , collective herding behavior is assumed to be the result of a rational choice .",
    "this approach can sometimes lead to arbitrary or even erroneous decisions as a macro phenomenon .",
    "this phenomenon is known as an information cascade @xcite    in our previous paper , we introduced a sequential voting model that is similar to a keynesian beauty contest @xcite@xcite@xcite . at each time step @xmath2 , one voter votes for one of two candidates .",
    "as public perception , the @xmath2th voter can see all previous votes , i.e. @xmath3 votes .",
    "there are two types of voters  herders and independents  and two candidates .",
    "herders are also known as copycat voters ; they vote for each candidate with probabilities that are proportional to the candidates votes .",
    "we refer to these herders as analog herders .",
    "we investigated a case wherein all the voters were herders @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the voting process is a plya process , and the voting rate converges to a beta distribution in a large time limit of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "next , we added independents to the analog herders @xcite . in the upper limit of @xmath2 ,",
    "the independents cause the distribution of votes to converge to a dirac measure against herders .",
    "this model contains three phases  two super diffusion phases and a normal diffusion phase .",
    "we refer to the transition in this model as a transition of super and normal diffusions .",
    "these transitions can be seen in several fields @xcite .",
    "if herders constitute the majority or even half of the total voters , the voting rate converges to a dirac measure slower than in a binomial distribution .",
    "these two phases have different speeds of convergence that are slower than in a binomial distribution . if independents constitute the majority of the voters , the voting rate converges at the same rate as that in a binomial distribution .",
    "if the independents vote for the correct candidate rather than for the wrong candidate , the model does not include the case wherein the majority of the voters choose the wrong candidate .",
    "the herders affect only the speed of the convergence ; they do not affect the voting rates for the correct candidate .",
    "next , we consider herders who always choose the candidate with a majority of the previous votes , which is visible to them @xcite . we refer to these herders as digital herders .",
    "digital herders exhibit stronger herd behavior than analog herders .",
    "we obtained exact solutions when the voters comprised a mix of digital herders and independents .",
    "as the fraction of herders increases , the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are wrong .",
    "this phase transition is referred to as information cascade transition .    here",
    ", we discuss a voting model with two candidates , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we set two types of voters  independents and herders .",
    "the voting of independents is based on their fundamental values .",
    "they collect information independently . on the other hand ,",
    "the voting of herders is based on the number of previous votes , which is visible to them . in this study",
    ", we consider the case wherein a voter can see all previous votes .    from experiments",
    ", we observed that human beings exhibit a behavior between that of digital and analog herders .",
    "we obtained the probability that a herder makes a choice under the influence of his / her prior voters votes .",
    "the probability can be fitted by a @xmath4 function . if the difference between numbers of voters for candidates @xmath0 and @xmath1 is small , the probability that a herder chooses the candidate receiving a majority of the previous votes increases rapidly . if the difference between numbers of voters for candidates @xmath0 and @xmath1 is large , the probability becomes constant . in this paper , we discuss rich phases of the models in which herders exhibit behavior that can be fitted to a @xmath4 function .",
    "we identify two types of phase transitions ",
    "information cascade transition and transition between super and normal diffusions .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the phases of models that we obtained from experiments @xcite .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce our voting model and mathematically define the two types of voters  independents and herders . in section 3 , we derive a stochastic differential equation . in section 4 , we discuss information cascade transition by using the stochastic differential equation . in section 5 , we discuss the phase transition between normal and super diffusions and we demonstrate the coexistence of these phase transitions . in section 6 ,",
    "we verify these transitions through numerical simulations . in section 7",
    ", we discuss social experiments from the viewpoint of our models .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "we model the voting of two candidates , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; at time @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have @xmath5 and @xmath6 votes , respectively . in each time step , one voter votes for one candidate ; the voting is sequential .",
    "hence , at time @xmath2 , the @xmath2th voter votes , after which the total number of votes is @xmath2 .",

    "in other words , we assume that the intelligence of the independents is virtually accurate . on the other hand , the herders votes are based on the number of previous votes .",
    "we use the following functions .",

    "if @xmath17 is positive and large , the voter has high confidence in the previous votes .",
    "we use function ( [ tanh ] ) for our social experiments , and it fits well to human behaviors in the experiments @xcite . in our experiments , we can estimate @xmath18 . if @xmath19 , herders vote for @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the same probability , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this model can also be derived from bayes theorem ( see appendix a ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath17 is not constant and it increases as the number of votes increases , according to the central limit theorem .",
    "the case is on the assumption that all voters are independents .",
    "hereafter , we treat @xmath17 as a parameter.(see figure [ model ] )    in the upper limit of @xmath17 , herders vote for the candidate with the majority votes .",
