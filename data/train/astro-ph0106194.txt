    "for measurements of the absorption line centers in qso spectra , there are three principal sources of statistical errors caused both by the data reduction procedure and by statistical fluctuations in the recorded counts .",
    "first , all echelle data must be rebinned to constant wavelength bins in order to combine different spectra and hence to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "such resampling changes statistical properties of the noise and introduces correlations between the data point values .",
    "the correlation coefficient of about + 0.8 was estimated by lddm for the uves data in question .",
    "this means that the classical @xmath50 test is _ no longer applicable _ to the rebinned spectra , because the measurements are not independent .",
    "the second error , usually important for lines observed in the ly@xmath18 forest , arises from the uncertainty of the overall continuum level and its shape in the vicinities of individual spectral features .",
    "the third error is connected with the finite number of photons counted .",
    "the individual intensity points within the interval of integration can fluctuate producing distortions in the line shape .",
    "there are , of course , other sources of errors in the measurements of the precise wavelengths @xmath25 of the observed h@xmath14 lines .",
    "the values of @xmath25 may be affected by errors in the wavelength calibration and by the thermal shifts .",
    "the observed wavelengths are not significantly affected by errors in the correction of the wavelength scale to the heliocentric and vacuum values .",
    "typically , these errors do not exceed a few m  s@xmath6 ( e.g. edln 1953 ) .",
    "the quasar spectrum is , however , constantly shifted with temperature by 0.37 pixel / k .",
    "given the approximate pixel size ( 0.02  ) at 4000  , we can expect the shift of at most 0.3 km  s@xmath6 in case the th calibration spectrum was taken a few hours after the science exposures and the difference in temperature was 0.5  k. the thermal shift should be more or less constant for all lines , so it affects only the assumed redshift .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are mainly affected by errors in the wavelength calibration .",
    "we found that the rms of this systematic error over the total range covered by the blue spectrum is @xmath51  .",
    "this corresponds at 4000  to 0.12 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the continuum placement in the uv portion of the q03473819 spectrum was determined by using ` continuum windows ' in the ly@xmath18 forest which were fitted by a low order polynomial .",
    "the accuracy @xmath52 of the local continuum ( which may deviate from the common continuum in the ly@xmath18 forest region ) was estimated during the fitting procedure described below .    for a given h@xmath0line",
    ", the number of pixels involved in the analysis corresponds to the number of points in the line profile shown in fig .  1 . to measure the line centers we used a method that matches the observed profiles with the synthesized ones to estimate the set of model parameters .",
    "our previous analysis of the line profiles of different elements identified in the @xmath1= 3.025 h@xmath14-bearing cloud has shown that both low ions and h@xmath0have the same simple velocity structure of the main component  a narrow symmetrical core with a common broadening parameter @xmath53 km  s@xmath6 ( lddm ) .",
    "thus in our present study we also used a simple one - component model with four free parameters : the center , the width , the intensity of the absorption line and the local continuum displacement @xmath54 ( this technique was successfully used in the study of metal lines in the ly@xmath18 forest by molaro et al .",

    "the results of these calculations are presented in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of table  1 .",
    "it is seen that for the selected h@xmath14 lines @xmath58% .",
    "this means that the h@xmath14 lines involved in the analysis are not significantly disturbed by the ly@xmath18 forest absorption .    in this approach",
    "the central wavelengths @xmath25 can be measured with an accuracy exceeded the average pixel size .",
    "as expected , the weaker absorption features have lower accuracy compared with the stronger lines . the corresponding redshifts for individual h@xmath0lines",
    "are shown in column ( 6 ) with the @xmath7 uncertainties including @xmath59 .",

    "if the ratio @xmath20 is not zero , then for any two h@xmath0lines with rest frame wavelengths @xmath63 and @xmath64 the ratio @xmath65 would deviate from unity , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the corresponding line centers measured in a quasar spectrum .    in equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) ,",
    "the so - called sensitivity coefficients @xmath68 determine the sensitivity of h@xmath0wavelengths to the variation of the proton - to - electron mass ratio .",
    "these coefficients have been calculated by varshalovich & levshakov ( 1993 ) and in a different manner by varshalovich & potekhin ( 1995 ) .",
    "both methods give results in good agreement .",
    "the most recent version of the procedure to calculate @xmath68 and @xmath69 from qso spectra is described in detail by potekhin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . following this procedure",
    "we calculated the sensitivity coefficients which are listed in column ( 7 ) of table  1 .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath68 values was also estimated from coefficients @xmath70 ( listed in table  1 in potekhin et al . ) using the method of error propagation ( @xmath70 values were considered to be accurate to @xmath71 decimal places and their rounding errors were set to @xmath72 ) .",
    "it should be noted that although transitions between the excited states of the h@xmath14 molecule have higher wavelength - to - mass sensitivity coefficients , their accuracy is much lower as compared with the low-@xmath23 transitions . in linear approximation",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 being the mean redshift and the mean sensitivity coefficient , respectively .",
    "the linear regression in the form ( [ eq : e5 ] ) was firstly calculated for the complete sample of the h@xmath0lines ( table  1 ) where transitions from the @xmath77 and 3 levels are combined .",
    "the obtained result @xmath78 ( which is consistent with the value independently found by ivanchik et al .",
    "2002 ) shows a `` possible variation '' of @xmath4 at the @xmath79 level .",
    "however , if we consider h@xmath0transitions from individual @xmath23 levels , then the weighted mean redshifts reveal a _ gradual shift in the radial velocity _ for features arising from progressively higher rotational levels  : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 standard deviations in last digits after a decimal point . ] . the h@xmath14 lines with changing profiles and small velocity shifts",
    "as @xmath23 increases were also observed in our galaxy in the direction of @xmath83 ori  a by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) who suggested that these h@xmath14 lines are formed in _",
    "different _ zones of a postshock gas .",
    "albeit the @xmath84 and @xmath85 values are consistent within @xmath7 intervals , the difference between @xmath84 and @xmath86 is essential and equals @xmath87 km  s@xmath6 . if we now exclude from the regression analysis levels with @xmath88 , then @xmath89 .",
    "( the use of samples with h@xmath0lines arising from the same rotational levels would be more reasonable to estimate @xmath90 , but in our case the sample size is rather small and we have to combine the @xmath91 and @xmath92 levels to increase accuracy ) .",
    "this linear regression is shown by the solid line in fig .  2 while two dashed lines correspond to the @xmath7 deviations of the slope parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we also calculated the probability density functions of @xmath69 for two samples of the h@xmath0lines ( with @xmath94 , and @xmath77 ) using statistical monte carlo simulations which suggest that the errors @xmath95 and @xmath96 are normally distributed around the mean values of @xmath62 and @xmath68 with the dispersions equal to their probable errors listed in table  1 . the result is presented in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that small changes in the radial velocity with increasing @xmath23 cause the difference between these two probability density functions and thus may mimic a shift in @xmath69 .    from these calculations we find @xmath97 ( @xmath7 ) which is about three times stronger as compared with the value estimated by potekhin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",

    "1996 ) , and even stronger limit of @xmath102 at @xmath1= 1.776 ( q1331 + 170 ) was set by cowie & songaila ( 1995 ) .",
    "comparison of hi 21 cm and molecular absorption ( co , @xmath103co , c@xmath104o , cs , hco@xmath105 , and hcn ) also yields very tight constrains on the ratio @xmath106 at @xmath1= 0.2467 and 0.6847 toward q1413 + 135 and q0218 + 357 , respectively ( murphy et al .",
