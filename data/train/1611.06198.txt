    "pne are constituted by ionized gas surrounding a low - intermediate mass hot evolved star .",
    "the gas was ejected by the star , at low velocity ( of about 10 km s@xmath0 ) , in advanced stages of evolution ( giant or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ) .",
    "thus the nebula is expanding away from the star with a velocity that depends on the ejection processes , the thermal processes and the interaction of the nebula with the interstellar medium .",
    "the ionized gas emits collisionally excited lines ( cels ) of ions of heavy element ( ions of c , n , o , ne , s , and others ) and recombination lines ( orls ) of h , he and ions of heavy elements . physical conditions ( temperature and density ) and ionic chemical abundances can be derived from both types of emission lines .",
    "total abundances are obtained by considering all the ions detected in the gas and including the not visible ions by correcting the partial abundances with ionization correction factors ( icfs ) or other procedures .",
    "it is a well known fact that ionic abundances derived by using cels or orls do not coincide for the same ion and usually the abundances from orls are larger than those from cels by factors of 2 or larger .",
    "this occurs in hii regions and pne as well ( see e.g. , garca - rojas & esteban 2007 ) . in some pne such a factor , known as the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) , can rise up to 100 or more but the mean value is around 3 ( mcnabb et al . 2013 ; garca - rojas et al .",
    "the origin of the adf is , so far , an open problem in astrophysics of gaseous nebulae .",
    "it has been attributed to temperature fluctuations ( e.g. , peimbert 1967 , 1971 ) , tiny metal - rich inclusions embedded in the h - rich plasma ( liu et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , gas inhomogeneities or other processes .",
    "these proposals would imply that cels and orls would be emitted in zones of different temperatures in the nebula , as cels are highly dependent of the electron temperature , while orls are much less dependent of this parameter and they would be emitted mainly in low temperature zones .    since some years ago some authors have indicated that the orls and cels emitted by the same ion seem to show different kinematical behavior or different physical distribution in the nebula .",
    "in several objects recombination lines of oii appears to show lower expansion velocities than [ oiii ] collisionally excited lines ( e.g. , otsuka et al .",
    "2010 ) or that the emission of orls from c@xmath1 and o@xmath1 strongly peak towards the nebular center , see e.g. , liu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , liu et al . (",
    "2006 ) and references therein .",
    "more recently richer et al . (",
    "2013 ) analyzed in detail the spatially and velocity - resolved spectroscopy of orls and cels for the same ion in ngc7009 , finding that the lines show discrepant kinematics and location .",
    "orls kinematics is incompatible with the ionization structure given by cels .",
    "these authors found that orls arise from a different volume than that giving rise to the forbidden emission from the same ion within this nebula , and suggest that there is an additional h - deficient plasma component .    also garca - rojas et al .",
    "( 2016 ) found that the oii @xmath24649 + 50 and the [ oiii]@xmath25007 have different spacial distribution in ngc6778 .",
    "these authors claim that these differences are consistent with the presence of a h - poor gas where orls are being emitted .",
    "we have analyzed the kinematics of orls and cels for some pne , for which we dispose of very high - resolution spectra , where the lines are well resolved .",
    "most of spectra were obtained with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle spectrograph ( mike , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* berstein et al . 2003 ) ) , attached to the 6.5-m magellan telescope clay , at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "most of these data have been already analyzed in order to derive physical conditions and chemical abundances from orls and cels and to determine the adfs for the objects ( garca - rojas et al .",
    "2012 ; garca - rojas et al .",
    "2013 ) . in these references",
    "the procedures for data reduction can be found .",
    "data for other objects have been collected from the literature .",
    "the total sample includes pne ionized by a [ wc ] central star , a _",
    "wels _ , or a normal .",
    "the adfs for the whole sample varies from 1.5 to 5 .    in this article",
    "we present partial results for cn1 - 5 ( pn g002.2 - 09.4 ) and pc14 ( pn g336.2 - 06.9 ) , ionized by a [ wc ] central star , as examples of the whole sample , which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "due to the high spectral resolution of our data ( mike has r @xmath3 28000 for a 1@xmath4 slit width ) the lines are well resolved and in several cases they are split showing blue and red components coming from the front and back zones of the expanding shell . in other cases the lines appear as a single component or show evidence of several overlapped components .",
    "cn1 - 5 and pc14 present split lines and we measured both components with iraf routines by fitting a gaussian profile to each line . thus the observed central wavelength and gaussian full width at half maximum ( @xmath5 ) were determined for several orls and cels in each object .",
    "the measured line widths were corrected by the instrumental width , considering that they add in quadrature .",
    "thermal widths were not corrected , therefore line widths include thermal width , turbulence and physical structure in the nebula .",
    "partial results for the cels and orls emitted by o@xmath6 , o@xmath1 , and n@xmath6 are presented in table 1 , where column 1 gives the ion i d . in columns 2 , 3 and 4 the observed central wavelength , line flux , and @xmath5 for lines in cn1 - 5",
    "are presented , and in columns 5 , 6 and 7 , the same data is given for pc14 .",
    "as usual , cels are represented with squared parenthesis , and orls without parenthesis .",
    "cels and orls from several other ions ( c@xmath6 , fe@xmath6 , fe@xmath1 , s@xmath6 , s@xmath1 , ne@xmath1 , etc . ) were also measured .",
    "expansion velocities ( v@xmath7 ) , as given by each cel and each orl , were calculated as half the difference between the red and blue components of each line .",
    "the final adopted v@xmath7 for each ion , is the average of velocities given by its different cels and orls .",
    "they are given at the end of table 1 .",
    ".central wavelength (  ) , flux ( erg @xmath8 s@xmath0 ) and gfwhm (  ) for some cels and orls in cn1 - 5 and pc14 .",
    "v@xmath7 in km s@xmath0 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "1 we present graphs showing the average v@xmath7 for each ion given by cels ( in blue ) and orls ( in red ) as a function of the ionization potential ( ip ) of the ion which , considering the stratification in the ionization structure usually found in a nebula , in some way represents the distance of the zone where the ion resides , relative to the central star .",
    "fig . 1 shows evidence of the structure of the velocity field inside the expanding nebulae , in the sense that v@xmath7 is lower near the central star and increases outwards .",
    "it is expected that low ionization species , which are farther away from the central star , have larger v@xmath7 than highly ionized species which lie nearer the star . in fig .",
    "1 this is particularly true for velocities given by cels , where a clear gradient is evident for both nebulae . in cn1 - 5",
    "v@xmath7 increases from about 24 km s@xmath0 for the highly ionized species",
    "( [ cliv ] , [ ariv ] ) to about 30 km s@xmath0 for [ nii ] and [ feii ] and the same happens with the cels in pc14 .",
    "for the case of orls , there is no gradient or a very flat one .",
    "low- and high - ionization species show about the same v@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , v@xmath7 of orls are smaller than v@xmath7 of cels , at the same ionization potential .",
    "this is very clear if one considers for instance v@xmath7[oiii ] and v@xmath7(oii ) in an object . in both cases presented here v@xmath7[o , iii ] @xmath9 v@xmath7(oii ) , and",
    "the same occurs for v@xmath7[nii ] and v@xmath7(ni ) .",
    "this result recurs in most of the objects under study ( pea et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "from the results shown above , it seems evident that , as far as cels and orls of the same ion do not share the same kinematics , these lines are not being emitted in the same zone of the nebula . considering the expansion velocity field in the nebula and due to orls",
    "show lower v@xmath7 they seem to be emitted in an inner zone . in this sense",
    "we are finding the same results reported by liu et a. ( 2000 ) , richer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and garca - rojas et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for ngc6153 , ngc7009 and ngc6778 respectively , where orls are being mainly emitted in an inner zone than cels",
    ". and that kinematics of orls is incompatible with that of cels . in cn1 - 5 and pc14 , the zones where orls are mainly emitted are not expanding in the same way as the zones where cels are emitted , and show lower v@xmath7 .",
    "it is tempting to say that orls come from h - deficient zones which were ejected by the star after the h - rich gas where cels are emitted .",
    "however at this point this is mainly speculative .",
    "much more analysis is needed , for a larger number of objects ."
