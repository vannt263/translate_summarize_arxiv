    "<S> the lz transition between the lower and higher subbands must be taken into account when the center - of - mass momentum of the atomic cloud is accelerated to the avoided crossing point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for convenience , we denote that @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 the momenta perpendicular and parallel to @xmath75 , respectively . since @xmath129 is unchanged , it is useful to define @xmath131 $ ] as the minimum of the upper subband energy with fixed @xmath129 </S>",
    "<S> . then a state initially at lower band and with momentum @xmath132 transitions to the upper band with the lz probability @xmath133  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the averaging transition probability is given by @xmath134 , with numerical results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zenerprobility ] for different parameter regimes .     for @xmath135 ( a ) and @xmath136 ( b ) , and at @xmath137 for @xmath138 ( c ) and @xmath139 ( d ) , with the magnitude of the gap @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters are taken as @xmath86khz , and the force @xmath141 applied along @xmath115 ( a , b ) and @xmath142 ( c , d ) directions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows represent the directions of atomic cloud motion . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the lz transition leads to the splitting of the atomic cloud from one to two , which provides a detection of the critical point of the topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zener ] . for the cases with @xmath143 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zener](a ) ] and @xmath144 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zener](b ) ] , a tiny bulk gap is located at @xmath54 . applying the static force along @xmath115 direction </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the atomic cloud first is deflected to @xmath145 [ for ( a ) ] or @xmath93 [ for ( b ) ] direction , and then splits into two when the central momentum is accelerated to the @xmath72 point . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic cloud corresponding to the lower subband keeps the original deflection route , while the new cloud formed by the atoms in the upper band states is deflected oppositely , reflecting that @xmath146 are opposite in the @xmath147 direction . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , by tuning @xmath148 , one can detect the phase transition due to the gap closing at @xmath149 and @xmath150 by applying the force along @xmath142 ( or @xmath151 ) direction [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zener](c , d ) ] .    in conclusion we proposed to detect 2d chern insulators by measuring the bulk states at four highly symmetric points of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> from a natural correspondence between the tr invariant topological insulator and the qah system , we show for a class of chern insulators that the topology can be determined by measuring the parity eigenstates at only highly symmetric points of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the detection relies on only qualitative rather than quantitative measurements on physical numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this enables a much simpler strategy to detect the topological phases comparing with conventional methods to measure the edge states or bulk chern invariants . </S>",
    "<S> we further introduced two realistic experimental schemes to carry out the measurement , and our detection strategy can be applied to both square and honeycomb lattice systems , the two most relevant configurations for the cold atom experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that these schemes can also be directly applied to the detection of tr invariant topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> our work showcases the advantages of cold atoms since the parity eigenstates are hard to directly measure in condensed matter system . </S>",
    "<S> our results can provide a powerful tool to detect topological phases in cold atoms .    </S>",
