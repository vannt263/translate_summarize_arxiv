    "<S> these _ coupling - induced oscillations _ may help in understanding how excitatory - inhibitory feedback can cause spontaneous oscillations in networks of naturally quiescent stochastic spiking neurons  @xcite , whose mean - field limit can in fact be described through the wilson - cowan equations . </S>",
