    "topological solitons arise as solutions of classical field equations and corresdond to points where the classical energy attains degenerate local minima .",
    "the classical energy of a topological soliton typically depends on an integer which can be interpreted as the number of solitons , and in some cases it is independent of the parameters which correspond to the positions and the sizes of individual solitons .",
    "therefore the quantum corrections can play a dominant role in the interactions between solitons .",
    "many techniques have been used for the numerical computation of the vacuum energies of single solitons @xcite .",
    "these methods rely heavily on the spherical symmetry which is usually implicit in the single soliton solutions . in this paper , we propose a new technique which does not rely on any symmetry and can therefore be applied to multiple soliton solutions .",
    "we will evaluate the vacuum energy for the @xmath0 model in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "previous work on single solitons in the @xmath0 model has used an approach based on heat kernel coefficients and phase shifts @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the solitons are unstable to collapse due to the quantum corrections .",
    "the @xmath0 sigma model also exhibits multi - soliton solutions .",
    "we focus on the charge-@xmath2 case and study their interaction due to quantum corrections .",
    "the quantisation of @xmath0 solitons can be performed by following the standard perturbation techniques invented by schwinger @xcite and developed in the 1970s by several authors ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the regularisation will be performed by the zeta - function technique , which we convert into a form that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "we examine how the finite one - loop energy depends on parameters such as the separation of the two solitons and their width .",
    "the @xmath0 sigma model consists of a single complex scalar field taking a value in the one dimensional complex projective plane @xmath0 .",
    "the action of the @xmath0 sigma model is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spacetime index running over @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the complex projective plane being mapped to a sphere stereographically , the @xmath0 model is equivalent to the @xmath8 model",
    ". let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be coordinates of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the stereographic coordinates are given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "expressing the action ( [ 2-action-1 ] ) in terms of @xmath14 , one can recover the @xmath8 sigma model action @xmath15    topological soliton solutions for the @xmath8 , or equivalently @xmath0 model , were discovered by belavin _",
    "_ @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "their solutions are instantons in two - dimensional euclidean spacetime , but at a classical level , they are the same as solitons in three - dimensional minkowski spacetime .    the static energy of the @xmath8 model is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 takes the values @xmath18 .",
    "the finite energy condition requires a boundary condition @xmath19 without loss of generality , we can define the asymptotic value of @xmath14 as @xmath20 which satisfies ( [ 2-boundary-1 ] ) .",
    "this boundary condition compactifies the space into a sphere .",
    "since the field space is also a sphere , the homotopy group of the fields is @xmath21 and hence there are soliton solutions .",
    "the topological charge is given by @xmath22 from the obvious identity @xmath23 one can derive @xmath24 this implies @xmath25 the soliton solutions attain minimum energy in each topological sector and hence saturate the equality .",
    "thus they satisfy the first order differential equation @xmath26 this equation turns out to be equivalent to the cauchy - riemann conditions in the @xmath0 version @xmath27 the general solution is given by the analytic function @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the complex parameters characterising the position and size of solitons respectively .",
    "note that the only singularities the field @xmath9 can have are isolated poles , since they merely correspond to the north pole of a sphere in the target space of the @xmath8 model .",
    "the degree of the mapping is equal to the topological charge of the solution ( [ 2-solution ] ) , which is also equal to the number of solutions when expressing @xmath32 in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 corresponds to the anti - soliton solution and gives an opposite charge of @xmath9 .",
    "for the sake of numerical work , we consider the @xmath0 model on the torus @xcite .",
    "this requires a slight modification of the previous soliton solutions .",
    "we shall assume that the field @xmath36 on the torus satisfies the periodic boundary condition @xmath37 the fact that the only singularities of @xmath38 are poles means @xmath38 is a meromorphic function .",
    "then @xmath38 can be represented as an elliptic function .    in the charge-@xmath2 case ,",
    "the solution is represented by the weierstrass function ( see appendix [ appendix : weier ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that the two solitons are symmetric in their size and location .",
    "then there are only two complex parameters required which are the degrees of freedom of the size and separation .",

    "the computation of the vacuum energy depends on solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath55 zero eigenvalues correspond to changes in the parameters , or moduli , of the soliton solution .",
    "the quantisation of these parameters is treated separately .",
    "expanding @xmath56 in terms of the remaining eigenfunctions gives an infinite sequence of ( degeneracy two ) oscillators with vacuum energy @xmath57 .",
    "the total vacuum energy can be regularised using the zeta - function scheme @xcite , @xmath58 where the sum over non - zero eigenvalues @xmath59 gives the generalised riemann zeta function for @xmath60 .",
    "the value at @xmath61 is uniquely determined by analytic continuation .",
    "we will now show how the zeta function regularisation scheme , which depends on analytic continuation , can be converted into a numerical subtraction scheme .",
    "suppose that on average the eigenvalues approach the form @xmath62 using ( [ asymlam ] ) , we can define the corresponding heat kernel @xmath63 the behiour of the heat kernel as @xmath64 gives information about the eigenvalues at large values of @xmath65 .",

    "however , we shall see in later sections how the difference does vanish ` on average ' , allowing a result to be obtained .",

    "the trial functions can be constructed as follows .",
    "we take @xmath98 linearly independent functions @xmath99 parametrised by n variational parameters @xmath100 and construct the trial function as their superposition @xmath101 inserting into ( [ 2-eigenfunction ] ) one obtains the functional @xmath97 as a function of the @xmath98 variational parameters @xmath102 = \\frac{\\sum_{m , n=1}^{n }      \\bar{c}_{m}c_{n}a_{mn } }      { \\sum_{m , n=1}^{n}\\bar{c}_{m}c_{n}b_{mn } }       \\label{functional - cn}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath103 then , from the minimum principle , the upper bound of the @xmath65th eigenvalue is given by the stationary point of @xmath104 $ ] with respect to @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath97 satisfies @xmath105}{\\partial c_{n } }      = 0 \\ ; .",

    "we take the basis of trial functions @xmath110 to be plane waves @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath114 are the mode numbers in the @xmath115 and @xmath116 directions respectively . with this basis ,",

    "to solve ( [ 2-secular ] ) numerically , we simply used the lapack ( linear algebra package ) which provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations , least - square solutions of linear systems of equations , eigenvalue problems , and singular value problems .",
    "the file actually used is _",
    "chegv.f _ for computing all eigenvalues of an hermitian - definite generalised eigenproblem .",
    "we have plotted the first 200 eigenvalues in fig.([eigenps ] ) as a function of the mode number @xmath122 for a typical background solution .",
    "the agreement with the asymptotic formula ( [ lamhat ] ) is quite striking .",
    "fig.([zetaps ] ) is a plot of the regularised zeta function as a function of the number of modes @xmath98 up to which we took the sum of the eigenvalues .",
    "the fluctuations in the data reflect the fact that the eigenvalues deviate from the asymtotic formula .",
    "although we can easily improve the accuracy of the individual eigenvalues , these fluctuations have a significant influence in preventing the convergence of the zeta - function in all of the cases which we have examined .",
    "this problem has been seen before in numerical calculations of zeta - functions @xcite .",

    "[ weierring ]    [ fitring ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented a numerical method for the computation of finite one - loop energies for solitons and studied its effect on the interaction of two @xmath0 solitons .",
    "the method does not require any symmetry to be present in the problem , but it is expensive in computer time and relies on the averaging out of residual terms in the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "further analysis of these eigenvalue residuals , which should be related to fundamental periods of the torus , would be useful and might improve the technique .",
    "the results are very satisfactory and show that initially separated solitons are unstable to collapse and merger .",
    "furthermore , the results are in qualitative agreement with the fast and reliable phase shift method @xcite for a ring configuration , which has circular symmetry .",
    "interestingly , the vacuum energy is not the only effect on the dynamics of two interacting solitons .",
    "there are additional forces arising from the reduction of the quantum field theory to the @xmath0 moduli space @xcite . in this example",
    ", an additional term is given by the ricci tensor of the moduli space , and gives a repulsive force between the two solitons which is larger than the effect of the vacuum energy at very small separations @xcite .    in principle , our methods are applicable to other solitons such as skyrmions , although moving from two to three dimensions would hughely increase the computer time .",
    "the one - loop correction to the calculation of the skyrmion mass is significant . for physical values of the pion decay",
