    "with run ii of the lhc now in progress , we are now able to probe well into the tev range in the search for new particles .",
    "one discoverable class of heavy particles which appears in many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios is that of scalar fields in adjoint representations of the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups .",
    "scenarios with scalar adjoints are quite diverse and candidate fields include chiral states that mix with gauginos in r - symmetric extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite@xcite , triplet higgs fields , various states in minimal flavor violating models @xcite , and kk partners of gauge bosons in extra - dimensional models @xcite . proposed",
    "search channels for these states vary depending on the scenario , but include such signatures as jets plus missing energy , @xmath0 and dijet resonances , and searches for w / z + jets @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    in this work we will explore the consequences of couplings between scalar adjoint fields and pairs of sm gauge bosons",
    ". we will begin in the framework of effective operator analysis . as we have seen from recent studies in higgs physics and dark matter phenomenology ,",
    "this is an extremely useful tool for systematically cataloging all possible interactions consistent with symmetries @xcite@xcite .",
    "we first present the most general effective lagrangian up to dimension 5 in which scalar fields in adjoint representations of the sm gauge groups couple to pairs of gauge bosons .",
    "these operators are allowed by all symmetries of the theory , we will therefore assume they are generically non - zero . some dimension 5 operators involving scalar adjoints have been well studied , for example the dimension 5 coupling between a scalar color octet and two gluons . here",
    ", we will present several additional operators which induce new di - boson couplings .",
    "we also discuss possible uv completions of the effective theory in several scenarios .",
    "these completions will involve integrating out a messenger sector of fields which are charged under multiple sm gauge groups .",
    "we will consider both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric completions of the effective operators .",
    "we will see that for typical completions , for example simple messenger sectors consisting of vector - like fermions , gauge invariance demands the simultaneous existence of multiple dimension 5 operators . in general individual operators can not be arbitrarily ignored .",
    "we then study the collider phenomenology induced by the operators in our effective lagrangian .    we choose to explore the phenomenology of a scalar color octet",
    "whose production and decay proceeds through loop - level couplings to pairs of standard model bosons .",
    "in particular we focus on the effective couplings between the scalar octet and a gluon and photon / z - boson .",
    "we argue that new proposed decay channels for the octet opens a window to constrain or discover various models of octet scalars .",
    "we recast several 8 tev lhc analyses to find current constraints on effective operators coefficients .",
    "these analyses include searches for dijet resonances , searches for excited quarks , and the inclusive search in the mono - jet channel .",
    "we then present the discovery potential for the scalar octet in a jet plus photon channel for the 14 tev run of lhc .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows , in section 2 we consider effective operators where a scalar sm adjoint may couple to gauge bosons . in section 3",
    "we discuss possible uv completions of the effective lagrangian . in section 4",
    "we focus on the production and decay modes of a scalar color octet at lhc given our set of effective operators . in section 5",
    "we present the bounds on scalar color adjoints in our scenario coming from a recast of existing searches lhc run 1 . in section 6",
    "we present a sensitivity search for scalar adjoints in @xmath1 channel in the 14 tev run of lhc .",
    "section 7 concludes .",
    "we will now explore the couplings of sm adjoint scalars to pairs of gauge bosons , beginning with operators of the lowest dimension .",
    "we consider two new spin 0 adjoint fields , color octet , s , with quantum numbers @xmath2 under sm gauge groups , and a weak triplet t with quantum numbers @xmath3 under sm gauge groups . at dimension 4 ,",
    "pairs of scalar adjoints have couplings to pairs of gauge bosons through their kinetic terms .",
    "however , couplings between a single adjoint and a pair of gauge bosons must come at higher dimension .",
    "we will now consider the complete set of gauge and lorentz invariant operators of dimension 5 where a scalar adjoint couples to pairs of gauge bosons .",
    "for the scalar color octet the gauge and lorentz invariant dimension 5 operators are    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the scale of new physics at which the operator is generated . here , @xmath6 is the su(3 ) field strength tensor and @xmath7 is the u(1 ) field strength tensor .",
    "the first operator couples the color adjoint to a pair of gluons , and is familiar from previous studies of color adjoint phenomenology . in this operator ,",
    "the color indices of the gluons and adjoint scalar are contracted symmetrically with @xmath8 .",
    "the second operator is also gauge and lorentz invariant . in this operator ,",
    "the lorentz indices are contracted between field strength tensors , while the color index is contracted between the gluon and the color octet .",
    "this is an effective coupling between the scalar octet , one gluon , and a photon / z - boson .",
    "similarly we may consider a similar operator governing the su(2 ) adjoint t    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the su(2 ) field strength tensor , and @xmath7 is the u(1 ) field strength tensor .",
    "lorentz indices are contracted between the field strength tensors , while the su(2 ) indices are contracted between the adjoint t and the su(2 ) field strength tensor . unlike su(3 ) , su(2 ) does not have a factor @xmath11 , therefore we may not write a coupling between the field t and two @xmath10 s as above",
    ". however , we may extend the list of possible gauge invariant operators if we allow the insertion of higgs fields to soak up su(2 ) indices .",
    "these operators will be of dimension 7 , but once higgs vevs are inserted , they become operators of effective dimension 5 .",
    "these dimension 7 operators are    @xmath12 b^{\\mu \\nu } b _ { \\mu \\nu}+ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{tww^3 } } [ h^{\\dagger } t h ] w^{\\mu \\nu } w _ { \\mu \\nu } + \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{tgg}^3 } [ h^{\\dagger } t h ] g^{\\mu \\nu } g _ { \\mu \\nu}+\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{sgw}^3 }   s^a g_a^{\\mu \\nu } [ h^{\\dagger}w^i _ { \\mu \\nu } h]\\ ] ]    in the first three terms we have contracted the su(2 ) indices of the adjoint t with those of the higgs fields to make an su(2 ) singlet ; this is indicated by brackets . in the last term , su(2 ) indicies are contracted between the su(2 ) field strength tensor and the higgs doublets .",
    "the su(2 ) structure of these operators is quite reminiscent of loop induced operators in two higgs doublet scenarios which couple the higgs fields to sm field strength tensors as , for example , in references @xcite@xcite .",
    "the operators above are of dimension 7 , however once the higgs vev is inserted one get operators of effective dimension 5 , which are suppressed by two powers of @xmath13 in the appendix we make a more complete list of operators for more complicated models where the scalar color octet may have additional quantum numbers under the other sm gauge groups .",
    "we expect the operators above may be generated at loop level by various uv completions of the theory .",
    "we give some illustrative examples in the next section .",
    "we expect our effective operators will be produced by integrating out heavy fields which have quantum numbers under several sm gauge groups .",
    "one of the simplest completions may be to include one or more generations of heavy vector - like quarks or leptons which carry hypercharge in addition to su(2 ) or su(3 ) quantum numbers .",
    "sets of these vector - like `` messenger '' fields may couple to our scalar adjoint fields through yukawa - like terms .",
    "for example , a set of vector - like quarks which carry hypercharge have quantum numbers @xmath14 and may couple to a scalar octet to generate the feynmann diagrams in fig .",
    "[ decay loop ] .",
    "these diagrams correspond to the operators in eqn 1 .",
    "the exact ratio of the operator coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 will depend on the hypercharge of the messengers . a general estimate for",
    "the ratio of effective couplings might be @xmath17 , though this depends on the details of messenger sector . the effective coupling to u(1 )",
    "gauge bosons is non - negligible and will provide additional production and decay channels for a scalar octet .",
    "this opens new windows for collider searches to illuminate new physics sectors .",
    "one large class of models which contain sm adjoint scalars are supersymmetric theories in which gauginos are dirac as opposed to majorana @xcite@xcite . in dirac gaugino models ,",
    "gauginos get mass by mixing with new chiral fields which are adjoints under the standard model gauge groups . in order to generate the dirac mass the relevant super - potential operator is @xmath18 where a denotes the chiral adjoint field",
    ", w is a standard model gauge field strength and @xmath19 is the field strength of a hidden @xmath20 gauge group which is broken at a high scale .",
    "this operator is expected to be generated by integrating out heavy messenger fields which are charged under the sm as well as the hidden - sector u(1 ) gauge group , thus the uv model is a form of gauge mediation @xcite .",
    "the hidden - sector u(1 ) field gets a d - term vev , thus the operator becomes a dirac mass for the sm gaugino , marrying it to the fermionic piece of the chiral adjoint . defining @xmath21",
    "we find the operator in equation 4 is equivalent to a dirac mass term @xmath22 for the gaugino .",
    "the chiral multiplet a is complex , it thus contains both real and imaginary scalar fields which are adjoints under a sm gauge group .",
    "the masses of the real and imaginary parts of the scalar adjoint depend greatly on the details of the messenger sector of the model see for example , see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "many models lead to tachyonic masses for one or the other adjoint , and fixes may produce a great range of adjoint masses . if the scalar adjoints are lighter than the gauginos and sparticles in the theory , then we expect their decays to follow through loops to sets of sm gauge bosons or fermions .",
    "we note that consistent with all symmetries in the theory we may also write the super - potential term    @xmath23    where a is the a chiral sm adjoint field , @xmath24 is the hypercharge field strength and w is appropriate su(2 ) or su(3 ) field strength tensor .",
    "this operator is nearly identical to the supersoft operator which generates dirac gaugino masses .",
    "we may also write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the su(3 ) field strength and s in the chiral su(3 ) adjoint . upon integration over @xmath27s , we see that these superpotential terms produce in the lagrangian our operators from eqns 1 and 2 .",
    "these operators are presumably generated much the same way as the supersoft term is , by integrating heavy fields out of the theory as we discuss below .",
    "we note that the lagrangian terms in eqns 1 and involve the real part of the adjoint .",
    "we might also expect similar operators generated by messenger loops to couple imaginary part of a and the sm field strength tensor and dual .",
    "many aspects of the phenomenology of scalar adjoints resultant from r symmetric susy models have been studied thoroughly @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is known , for example , that an octet - gluon - gluon coupling may be generated by integrating out squarks from the r symmetric theory .",
    "similar diagrams involving squarks and sleptons will generate the the operators in eqn 5 .",
    "squarks and sleptons couple to the real part of the chiral adjoints through kahler potential d - terms . due to a cancelation of diagrams",
    ", it is known that operators following from sparticle loops are suppressed when left and right sparticle masses are degenerate .",
    "another source of operators in eqn 5 and 6 are loops of the heavy messenger fields .",
    "these messengers carry sm quantum numbers , and in many completions are often various sets of fundamentals and anti - fundamentals under su(5 ) , see for example @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the relative size of the operators in eqns 5 and 6 will depend on the details of the messenger sector , and on the sparticle spectrum .",
    "effective dimension 7 operators like those of eqn 3 may be produced through loops of squarks and sleptons , as these sparticles are charged under multiple sm gauge groups and couple to the higgs .",
    "thus in supersoft models we find numerous effective operators which couple scalar adjoints to pairs of gauge bosons . as a phenomenological note",
    ", the real part of the supersoft adjoints may also decay to quarks / leptons through loops .",
    "these decays , however , do not always dominate adjoint branching fractions - there are various regions of parameter space where these decays are subdominant to decays into gauge bosons .",
    "this region of parameter space will be of special interest to the phenomenological discussions of the next section .",
    "we will now consider the collider phenomenology of our effective operators .",
    "we will focus on the phenomenology of colored states as they should be produced with large cross section at the lhc .",
    "as such , we will study the production and decay of a single scalar color octet .",
    "we will assume that , besides mass and kinetic terms , the octet has only dimension 5 couplings to sm gauge bosons resulting from the operators in eqn 1 .",
    "our simple model has three parameters , the mass of the octet @xmath28 , and the two effective operator coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in a uv complete model",
    "we would know the exact ratio between the operator coefficients , not knowing the details of the high energy model , however , we will consider these two parameters to be independent .",
    "the two operator coefficients control the couplings of the scalar color octet to three pairs of sm gauge bosons @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we consider here only the single octet production process @xmath34 , which proceeds through gluon fusion .",
    "the total production cross section is proportional to the gluon - gluon decay width , @xmath35 , of the octet , and is given by ,    @xmath36    where @xmath28 is the mass of the scalar , @xmath37 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for gluons , @xmath38 is the momentum fraction of the initial gluons , and @xmath39 takes into account the interchange of summed and averaged over states in the decay rate and production cross section . the octet decay width into gluons @xmath35 is given by @xmath40 we note that the decay width scales like @xmath41 leading to fairly wide resonances for larger masses of the octet .",
    "the production cross section of the octet decreases with increasing parameter @xmath42 , it also decreases with increasing scale of the effective cut - off @xmath15 .",
    "higher order corrections to the production of color - octet scalars can have very large effects @xcite .",
    "a k - factor is used to scale up the tree level production cross section of the scalar octet . a typical k - factor for",
    "the process @xmath43 at @xmath44 is between 2.4 and 3.6 for a tev scale octet . in the analyses in this work we choose a k - factor of 2 for octet production at @xmath45 tev and a k - factor of 2.5 for a sensitivity projection at @xmath44 tev .    in figure [ single production xsection ]",
    "we plot the octet production cross section vs. @xmath28 for the process @xmath43 in 8 tev proton - proton collisions . in the figure",
    "we have chosen the effective operator coefficient @xmath15 to be 10 tev , but this total production cross section may easily be re - scaled for various values of the effective cut - off .     in pp collisions at @xmath45 tev with @xmath46 tev .",
    "these cross sections were generated with madgraph 5 .",
    "]    we will now consider the decays of the scalar octet . in our model",
    "there are three possible di - boson decay channels for the octet , @xmath47 .",
    "that is , decays into two gluons , a gluon photon pair , and a gluon z pair . using the effective lagrangian in eqn 1",
    ", we may calculate the branching fractions . in the limit that the octet is much heavier than the z boson , that is @xmath48 , the branching fractions are given by ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the sine and cosine of the weak angle and @xmath5 are the effective operator coefficients .",
    "the exact form of the branching fractions are given in the appendix . by varying the ratio of effective couplings",
    "@xmath52 , we may change the branching fraction rates into the various diboson channels . for generic completions of the effective theory , for example including sets heavy vector - like quarks with electric charge in the range 1/3 , we expect the ratio of the branching fractions @xmath53 to be in the percent range . this branching fraction is not insignificant , and together with the large octet production cross section it will mean that there is a substantial signal in the @xmath32 resonance channel . as we will see below , this is an interesting and a relatively clean channel , it will therefore be important for scalar octet searches .",
    "we will now discuss the bounds on parameter space which result from various 8 tev analyses in run i of the lhc . in our model",
    ", production and decay of the octet produces many interesting final state topologies , therefore there are multiple search channels that can be relevant in the constraint or discovery of the scenario .",
    "both atlas and cms have performed searches for heavy resonances decaying into various final states , and one standard search for new colored resonances is in the dijet resonance channel , @xmath54 @xcite@xcite . here a heavy state , @xmath55 , is produced and then decays hadronically .",
    "these searches constrain the parameter space of our color adjoint operators as the scalar octet generically has significant branching fraction into the gluon - gluon final state .",
    "in addition atlas and cms have performed searches for resonances which decay to a photon and jet final state @xcite @xcite .",

    "effective couplings of these adjoints to pairs of vector bosons may lead to very interesting decay chains .",

    ". a combinations of final state searches will be the most powerful tool to rule on the parameter space of these models . this will also help to determine to the correct uv physics if a scalar adjoint signal is seen in a channel .",
    "for example , in an r - symmetric - mssm scenario the detection of a scalar color octet in the dijet resonance channel would demand a specific rate in the j+photon channel as well . measuring",
    "these rate would give valuable information about the messenger and squark sectors of the theory .",
