    "<S> using recent polarimetric observations of the crab nebula in the hard x - ray band by integral , we show that the absence of vacuum birefringence effects constrains @xmath0 lorentz violation in qed to the level @xmath1 at @xmath2 cl , tightening by more than three orders of magnitude previous constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we show that planned x - ray polarimeters have the potential to probe @xmath3 by detecting polarization in active galaxies at red - shift @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental constraints on the parameters quantifying lorentz invariance violation ( lv ) are of fundamental importance . </S>",
    "<S> because the lowest order corrections predicted in the photon dispersion relation imply the vacuum is birefringent , observations of polarized photons from distant astronomical sources provide very promising tests . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the recently discovered linear polarization of hard x - rays from the crab nebula ( cn ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations show a remarkably high degree of linear polarization ( @xmath5 ) and very close alignment of the polarization vector with both the optical polarization vector and the projection on the sky of the spin axis of the central neutron star . the high degree of polarization together with the lack of detectable rotation of the polarization vector of these @xmath6kev photons whilst propagating over the intervening @xmath7 cm enables us to tighten existing constraints by three orders of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the possible high energy violations of local lorentz invariance as well as a flourishing of observational tests . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , specific hints of lv arose from various approaches to quantum gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most tests require a well established theoretical framework to calculate reaction rates and describe the particle dynamics . here , we work within the framework of effective field theory with non - renormalizable , mass dimension 5 lv operators ( see  @xcite and references therein ) restricted to qed , for which the most general dispersion relations for photons and electrons are @xmath8 where ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) refers to photons   and ( [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) to fermions . @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath9 to be comparable to the planck mass @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate the strength of the lv . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 signs denote right and left circular polarization in ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) , and positive and negative helicity states of the fermion in ( [ eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot ] ) implies that the direction of polarization rotates during propagation due to the different velocities of the right- and left - handed circular polarizations , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is known as vacuum birefringence ( vb ) . </S>",
    "<S> although it may seem hopeless to search directly for effects suppressed by the planck energy scale , even tiny corrections can be magnified to measurable ones when dealing with high energies , long distances of signal propagation or peculiar reactions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently @xmath15 have been constrained to have a magnitude less than @xmath16 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) by a detailed analysis of the synchrotron component of the cn broadband spectrum @xcite , while the constraint @xmath17 has been obtained by @xcite considering the absence of vb effects during the propagation of optical / uv polarized light from gamma - ray bursts ( grb )  , were claimed in  @xcite from grb  021206 observations  @xcite ; however the result was later contested  @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are also preliminary indications , based on an analysis of the photon fraction in ultra - high - energy cosmic rays , that these coefficients might be less than @xmath18 , though nothing conclusive can be claimed yet @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we tighten the current constraints on @xmath19 suppressed lv by about three orders of magnitude for photons , by considering the limits on vb effects implied by the recently detected @xcite polarized hard x - rays from the cn . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we set such constraints following the arguments by @xcite , an approach robust against systematic uncertainties related to astrophysical modeling . </S>",
    "<S> we then infer tighter limits that exploit and rely on modeling of the crab nebula and pulsar .    finally , we consider the constraints which future x - ray polarization measurements of extragalactic objects , e.g.  active galactic nuclei ( agn ) will allow . </S>",
    "<S> this is of particular interest in the light of current experimental efforts to build x - ray polarimeters @xcite .    during propagation over a distance @xmath20  , </S>",
    "<S> the ( cosmological ) distance is given by @xmath21 , which includes a @xmath22 factor in the integrand to take into account the red - shift acting on the photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> as usual , @xmath23 is the present value of the hubble parameter , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the density fractions of cosmological constant and matter in the universe , respectively . ] , the polarization vector of a linearly polarized plane wave with momentum @xmath26 rotates through an angle @xcite , @xmath27 observations of polarized light from a distant source can constrain @xmath28 in two ways , depending on the amount of available information on both the observational and the theoretical ( i.e.  source modeling ) side :    1 .   since detectors have a finite energy bandwidth , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theta ] ) is never probed in real situations . </S>",
    "<S> rather , if some net amount of polarization is measured in the band @xmath29 , an order - of - magnitude constraint arises from the fact that if the angle of polarization rotation ( [ eq : theta ] ) were to differ by more than @xmath30 over this band , the detected polarization would fluctuate sufficiently for the net signal polarization to be suppressed @xcite . from ( [ eq : theta ] ) , this constraint is @xmath31 this just requires that any intrinsic polarization ( at source ) is not completely washed out during signal propagation . </S>",
    "<S> it thus relies on the mere detection of a polarized signal , without considering the observed polarization degree . </S>",
    "<S> a more refined limit can be obtained by calculating the maximum observable polarization degree , given the maximum intrinsic value @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the maximum intrinsic degree of polarization , @xmath34 is defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theta ] ) and the average is weighted over the source spectrum and instrumental efficiency , represented by the normalized weight function @xmath35  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conservatively , one can set @xmath36 , but a lower value can sometimes be justified on the basis of source modeling . </S>",
    "<S> using , one can then cast a constraint by requiring @xmath37 to exceed the observed value . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   suppose that polarized light measured in a certain energy band has a position angle @xmath38 with respect to a fixed direction . </S>",
    "<S> at fixed energy , the polarization vector rotates by the angle ( [ eq : theta ] ) ; if the position angle is measured by averaging over a certain energy range , the final net rotation @xmath39 is given by the superposition of the polarization vectors of all the photons in that range : @xmath40 where @xmath34 is given by ( [ eq : theta ] ) . if the position angle at emission @xmath41 in the same energy band is known from a model of the emitting source , a constraint can be set by imposing @xmath42 although this limit is tighter than that obtained from the previous methods , it clearly hinges on assumptions about the nature of the source , which may introduce significant uncertainties .    in the case of the crab nebula , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath43% degree of linear polarization in the @xmath44 band has recently been measured by the integral mission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement uses all photons within the spi instrument energy band . </S>",
    "<S> however the convolution of the instrumental sensitivity to polarization with the detected number counts as a function of energy , @xmath35 , is maximized and approximately constant within a narrower energy band ( 150 to 300 kev ) and falls steeply outside this range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we shall , conservatively , assume that most polarized photons are concentrated in this band . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : decrease_pol ] ) leads to the order - of - magnitude estimate @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> a more accurate limit follows from ( [ eq : pol ] ) . in the case of the cn </S>",
    "<S> there is a robust understanding that photons in the range of interest are produced via the synchrotron proces , for which the maximum degree of intrinsic linear polarization is about @xmath49 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : casea ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath11 for the distance of the cn and for @xmath51 . the requirement @xmath52 ( taking account of a @xmath2 offset from the best fit value @xmath53 ) leads to the constraint ( at 99% cl ) @xmath54     on @xmath11 for the distance of the cn and photons in the 150300 kev range , for a constant @xmath35 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that x - ray polarization measurements of the cn already available in 1978 @xcite , set a constraint @xmath55 , only one order of magnitude less stringent than that reported in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> constraint ( [ eq : constraint - degree ] ) can be tightened by exploiting the current astrophysical understanding of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the cn is a cloud of relativistic particles and fields powered by a rapidly rotating , strongly magnetized neutron star . both the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ chandra _ x - ray satellite have imaged the system , revealing a jet and torus that clearly identify the neutron star rotation axis @xcite . the projection of this axis on the sky lies at a position angle of @xmath56 ( measured from north in anti - clockwise ) . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron star itself emits pulsed radiation at its rotation frequency of 30 hz . in the optical band </S>",
    "<S> these pulses are superimposed on a fainter steady component with a linear polarization degree of  30% and direction precisely aligned with that of the rotation axis @xcite . the direction of polarization measured by integral - spi in the @xmath57-rays is @xmath58 ( @xmath59 error ) from the north , thus also closely aligned with the jet direction and remarkably consistent with the optical observations .    </S>",
    "<S> this compelling ( theoretical and observational ) evidence allows us to use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : constraint - caseb ] ) . conservatively assuming @xmath60 ( i.e.  @xmath2 from @xmath41 , 99% cl ) , this translates into the limit @xmath61 and @xmath62 for a @xmath63 deviation ( 95% cl ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : caseb ] shows @xmath64 as function of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the left  hand panel reports the global dependence ( the spikes correspond to rotations by @xmath65 ) , while the right  hand panel focuses on the interesting range of values . ) rules out the possibility that the polarization angle is close to the expected one after rotating by some multiple of @xmath66 ( the polarization angle is defined on the interval @xmath67 $ ] ) . ]        </S>",
    "<S> the constraints presented in ( [ eq : constraint - degree ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint - serious - crab ] ) are remarkably strong . </S>",
    "<S> although based on a cumulative effect , they are achieved using a local ( galactic ) object . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies , on the one hand , in the quadratic dependence of @xmath34 on the photon energy , in constrast with the linear gain given by distance ( see e.g.  eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theta ] ) ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the robust theoretical understanding of the cn has enabled us to strengthen the constraints significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> further improvements on lv constraints via birefringenge are expected thanks to the forthcoming high - energy polarimeters , such as xeus @xcite , pogolite @xcite , polar - x @xcite and gamma ray imager @xcite which will provide an unprecedented sensitivity , sufficient to detect polarized light at a few % levels also in extragalactic sources . </S>",
    "<S> the lv limits will be optimized by balancing between source distance and observational energy range depending on the detector sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : plot ] , where the strength of the possible constraints ( cast with the first , most general method described above ) is plotted versus the distance of sources ( in red - shift @xmath68 ) and for different energy bands ( medium x- and @xmath57-rays ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , constraints of order @xmath69 could be placed if some polarized distant sources ( @xmath70 ) will be observed by such instruments at 1 mev . </S>"
