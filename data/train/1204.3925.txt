    "our model appears to use similar cooling to @xcite but possibly somewhat weaker than @xcite .",

    "the bsg bow shock is no longer supported by the fast wind s ram pressure , so it retreats towards the slowly expanding rsg wind , preceded by the reverse shock .",
    "the rsg wind has no shell because @xmath43 decreases monotonically with time during the transition ( so successive layers of wind material do nt interact ) .",
    "between times ( b ) and ( c ) the hot bubble still has a large sound speed , so the reverse shock collapses onto the rsg wind rapidly , compressing the shell at @xmath44pc , and creating a thinner , denser shell at the edge of the rsg wind by 11.8829 myr .",
    "the mass of the inner shocked - shell grows linearly with time from zero at 11.882 myr to @xmath45 at 11.892 myr , when it reaches the upstream contact discontinuity and merges with it .    at time ( c )",
    "the thin shell surrounding the rsg wind is shaped like a bow shock , with mass and physical size similar to that determined from _ akari _ data @xcite . a second , much weaker shell",
    "is also seen at a slightly larger radius .",
    "both the bsg forward shock and contact discontinuity are still being swept downstream , but the weak shell - like feature at @xmath46 pc in curve c shows that gas pressure in the compressed hot bubble is impacting the contact discontinuity .",
    "we identify the retreating contact discontinuity as a counterpart to the `` bar '' upstream from betelgeuse s bow shock .",
    "this transitory phase , from when the rsg wind encounters the bsg reverse shock to when it reaches the bsg contact discontinuity , lasts 10 kyr .",
    "the two shells have merged by @xmath47 myr .",
    "after time ( c ) the density structure is that of layered shells , which soon merge as the rsg wind pushes through the bsg bow shock , and by the end of the star s life at time ( d ) the rsg wind has reached the undisturbed ism and is forming a new bow shock .",
    "the rsg wind is also bounded by a shell downstream because of the pressure of the collapsing bsg bubble .",
    "it would take @xmath48kyr ( from the time it loses pressure support ) for the bsg shock to be completely swept downstream on the simulation domain shown , so the transition phase is far from complete at the pre - sn stage .",
    "ir observations of betelgeuse s csm @xcite show that the standoff distance of the bow shock is @xmath49 pc , and that of the bar is @xmath50 0.45 pc ( for @xmath51 pc ) .",
    "[ fig : denstemp ] shows that a bsg bow shock which collapses as the star becomes a rsg produces strikingly similar structures . in this model",
    "the `` bow shock '' around betelgeuse is actually the collapsing bsg reverse shock interacting with the expanding rsg wind , and the bar is the bsg contact discontinuity .",
    "the total gas mass in betelgeuse s combined wind and bow shock is estimated at @xmath52 from _ iras _ data @xcite ; in our model at time ( c ) the total mass within @xmath53 pc is @xmath54 , in good agreement .",
    "the bow shock mass is @xmath55 from _ akari _ data @xcite , or possibly as small as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath57 less massive than steady - state bow shocks ( @xmath58 ) from simulations of runaway rsgs @xcite , a problem which motivated the study presented here . in our model",
    "the expanding rsg wind effectively encounters a vacuum initially , so there is no swept up shell from the early expansion and consequently its mass is much lower than a normal rsg bow shock , @xmath59 .",
    "our model therefore provides a good explanation for the mass of the bow shock , and is consistent with the rsg wind mass .",
    "_ herschel _ observations of betelgeuse @xcite show that the bow shock seems to have a layered structure .",
    "the local maximum in wind density during the bsg@xmath60rsg transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ) remains visible in our simulation ( figs .",
    "[ fig : denstemp ] and [ fig : densitycuts ] ) for some time outside the inner shell , and such modulations in the wind properties could explain the observed layers .",
    "there are two upstream discontinuities that could correspond to the bar seen upstream from betelgeuse s bow shock , namely the bsg forward shock and contact discontinuity ( or both , if the bow shock were a thin shell ) . for the simulation presented here",
    "the contact discontinuity provides the most likely counterpart , based on its position and shape at the time the inner shocked - shell is visible .",
    "we calculate the observed properties of the 2-d models ( they have cylindrical symmetry ) to test this hypothesis . the projected dust - emission intensity ( upper half - plane , in @xmath61 per pixel ) and projected mass ( lower half - plane , in @xmath62 ) are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : projected ] at time ( c ) ( 11.8875 myr ) .",
    "dust emission in the iras @xmath63 m waveband is calculated assuming radiative equilibrium , and using the same assumptions for dust size and composition as @xcite with a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath64 .",
    "the inner shocked - shell and a prominent outer shell are still apparent , both in projected density and in dust emission .",
    "the @xmath65 decrease in dust emission makes the contact discontinuity look a little more like a bar ( compared to projected density ) because the strongly curved parts at larger radii are fainter .",
    "the total dust luminosity of the rsg wind , bow shock , and bar from this model are lower than the _",
    "iras_/_akari _ observations , suggesting radiative excitation from betelgeuse s radiation may not be the dominant process exciting the dust emission . converting from simulated mass density to far - infrared emission is complicated , however , because the dust composition of the ism , bsg and rsg winds are probably all somewhat different . increasing the dust - to - gas ratio would increase the predicted luminosity .",
    "it is also not clear what contribution c and o fine - structure lines make to the far - ir emission .",
    "we have only considered betelgeuse s radiation as the energy source for the dust emission , but radiation produced within the bow shocks and hot bubble probably also contribute .",
    "the observed bar has no discernible curvature , but a strong prediction of our model is that it must eventually begin to curve back into a bow shock shape , if physically associated with betelgeuse",
    ". the radius of curvature can be larger than the current standoff distance of the bar would suggest if it is a relic structure that is currently being overtaken by the star ( cf .",
    "[ fig : denstemp ] ) .",
    "instabilities provide another mechanism for reducing bow shock curvature ( compare panels a and b of fig .",
    "[ fig : denstemp ] ) : the shock flexes periodically as vortices are generated and shed downstream , and the curvature of the contact discontinuity can consequently fluctuate quite dramatically .",
    "this has also been seen in previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the transition timescale , from when the rsg wind appears to when the bsg wind s bow shock has disappeared , can be quite long and is beyond the end of the star s life in this model .",
    "the bsg bow shock loses pressure support on a timescale comparable to the 10 - 15 kyr required for the star to expand to a rsg .",
    "subsequently , if the star is moving with @xmath21 and the wind has @xmath66pc , the time to cross this distance is @xmath67kyr but it can take three times as long for the bow shock to stall and be swept far downstream . for larger @xmath68 and lower",
    "@xmath69 it is possible for the observable bow shock transition to last @xmath70 kyr , a significant fraction of the massive star s post - ms evolution , hence it may not be unusual to observe a rsg during this transition .",
    "the transition from ms to rsg ( not presented here ) is qualitatively similar , differing in the wind strengths and speed of transition .",
    "a number of uncertainties affect our model .",
    "betelgeuse s mass is poorly constrained @xcite and the properties of the proposed blue phase of evolution are unknown , hence the bsg wind parameters are unconstrained .",
    "even with accurate stellar parameters , blue loop evolution is very sensitive to assumed physics in the models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ism density and the ambient magnetic field ( not considered here ) also affect shock properties , and even betelgeuse s spatial velocity through its local ism has significant uncertainties @xcite .",
    "stronger observational constraints on the ambient ism properties would greatly help in constructing better models tailored specifically to betelgeuse .",
    "multiwavelength observations of the bar and bow shock would better constrain their dust properties , providing more reliable mass estimates .",
    "we expect that new ir observations from e.g.  _ herschel _ and _ sofia _ will strongly test and constrain our model .",
    "we have presented the first quantitative calculation of bow shock evolution for a massive runaway star undergoing the transition from blue to red on the hr diagram , here for a @xmath71 star evolving from bsg to rsg .",
    "in contrast to the previously - studied case of the transition from rsg to wr , here the initial wind is faster than the following wind and so the bow shock has time to stall and collapse in on itself before it is destroyed and re - formed by the newly expanding rsg wind .",
    "the bsg reverse shock collapses in on the rsg wind very rapidly ( at the hot - bubble sound speed ) , producing an inner shocked - shell around the expanding rsg wind , and eventually wraps around to completely enclose it .",
    "there is a short timeframe ( 10 kyr in this calculation ) during which this inner shocked - shell resembles a bow shock and can be observed simultaneously with the much larger - scale bow shock left over from the bsg wind .",
    "this bow shock is then overtaken by the slowly expanding rsg wind .",
    "the transition time during which the bsg bow shock is still interacting with the expanding rsg wind can be @xmath72 kyr , depending on the star s velocity through the ism , the strength of the fast wind , and the ambient ism density .",
    "this is already a significant percentage of the time a massive star spends as a rsg , so it is possible that runaway rsgs may be commonly observed to have such features in their csm .",
    "the inner shocked - shell s mass , shape , thickness and size are consistent with the observed properties of betelgeuse s bow shock , in contrast to steady - state bow shocks which are typically more than an order of magnitude more massive .",
    "our model also naturally provides a possible counterpart to the infrared bar ahead of betelgeuse s bow shock , the bsg wind s shocked - shell .",
    "we have also shown that dust emission from the inner shocked - shell and outer bow shock may have similar emissivities .",
