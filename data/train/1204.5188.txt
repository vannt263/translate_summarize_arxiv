    "there is ample observational evidence that bulges in early type spiral galaxies come in different varieties .",
    "they are not all just like small elliptical galaxies which happen to live in the centre of a spiral disk @xcite .",
    "while classical bulges seem to lie on photometric projections of the the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies @xcite pseudobulges resemble disks more than little ellipticals .",
    "they are still photometrically distinct from the outer disk as they appear as a central brightening above the inwards extrapolation of the outer exponential disk profile . however , as opposed to classical bulges , their srsic indices fall close - to or below two @xcite .",
    "other groups have shown that a large fraction of galaxies with boxy or peanut shaped bulges do show signs of inner disks @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of inner disks is however not limited to bulges that morphologically resemble disks as a whole @xcite , although it seems ubiquitous in this class of objects .",
    "internal secular evolution is commonly seen as an important channel for the formation of central disk - like structures @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "asymmetries such as spiral structure and bars support the angular momentum transfer of disk material and thereby the transport of gas into the inner bulge regions . in their recent study of bulges within the local 11  mpc volume @xcite",
    "show that a majority of bulges in the local universe are pseudobulges .",
    "their existence in large quantities in our local ( low density ) environment may seem to pose a problem for the understanding of the baryonic physics of galaxy formation @xcite as , at first sight , it is not clear how central disks would survive the large quantity of low redshift ( @xmath6 @xmath71 ) mergers @xcite typical of @xmath8cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "but disk structures do not have to be destroyed in all mergers .",
    "@xcite show that the heating of the disks in a minor merging event is a non - linear function of progenitor mass ratio once the satellite rigidity and the orbits are modelled properly .",
    "in addition to the impact parameters and the mass fraction , the baryonic gas content within the progenitors is an important parameter to the final result of a merging process @xcite  _ wet mergers _ are more likely to produce disks .",
    "minor mergers may also create inner disk structures @xcite while increasing the srsic index only moderately @xcite .",
    "based on semi - analytical models for hierarchical growth which include prescriptions for the survival of disks , @xcite show that the existence of the majority of the galaxies with no significant bulge component in the local volume can be understood in the context of @xmath8cdm .",
    "@xcite identify a number of criteria to differentiate between classical and pseudobulges such as the bulge vs.  the disk ellipticity , their location in the @xmath9 diagram and the bulge morphology .",
    "@xcite show that the bulge srsic index is successful in differentiating bulge types  pseudobulges have srsic indices that fall near or below @xmath10 , unlike classical bulges and elliptical galaxies which have higher srsic indices .",
    "the identification of the bulge morphology as well as the accurate derivation of photometric structural parameters heavily relies on high spatial resolution imaging .",
    "recently , such data has become available for a large number of bulges .",
    "adding sufficiently high - resolution spectroscopic data allows us to ask the question whether all morphologically disk - like bulges also show kinematic disk - like behaviour , such as high @xmath4 values and/or flattening or drops in the @xmath11 profile ? also , whether differences seen in structural parameters such as srsic index are reflected in the kinematic structure as well ? in  [ sec : sample ] we describe the sample selection and characteristics , in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we describe the long - slit observations , in  [ sec : reduction ] we give account on the derivation of @xmath12-band surface brightness profiles and their decomposition , as well as the details of the data reduction , especially the removal of emission features , and finally the kinematic extraction .",
    "our results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss correlations between kinematic parameters and morphological parameters and indications for an increased rotational support of pseudobulges .",
    "we finally discuss and summarize our findings in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "as we aim to study the kinematics of bulges , our sample consists of 45  galaxies spanning the full range of hubble types that do contain bulges : s0 to sbc .",
    "further , roughly two - thirds of our galaxies are barred , a similar fraction to the total fraction of bars observed in the local universe ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] lists the objects in our sample . for signal - to - noise ( @xmath13 ) reasons we are biased towards high - luminosity objects .",
    "absolute b - band magnitudes span the range from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "central velocity dispersions lie between 60  kms@xmath3 and 220  kms@xmath3 .",
    "we select our targets to be located close enough in distance to properly resolve the bulge regions in typical seeing conditions . with the exception of ngc2964 and ngc4030 ,",
    "all galaxies have bulge radii larger than 5  arcseconds and are typically located at distances closer than 25  mpc .",
    "only ngc4030 , ngc4260 , and ngc4772 are located at significantly larger distances of 29.3  mpc , 48.4  mpc and 40.9  mpc , respectively .",
    "the bulge radii of 7.3  arcseconds and 23.5  arcseconds of the latter two leave us confident that we are able to nevertheless sufficiently resolve their bulges . ngc2964 and",
    "ngc4030 have bulge radii of 3.1  arcseconds and 3.0  arcseconds , and are excluded from all structural analysis concerning the bulges , we restrict ourselves to presenting their kinematic data .        in order to break the known degeneracy between the bulge effective radius and srsic index in 1d surface brightness decompositions @xcite we require all our targets to have hst imaging in f160w , i , or r band .",
    "most of the objects are found in @xcite and/or @xcite and have extensive hst and ground - based multi - wavelength coverage . to allow for a visual inspection and morphological classification of the bulge region we select objects which have close - to @xmath16-band hst images of their bulge region ( see  [ sec : pseudoid ] ) available from the archive and we do not observe edge - on or close - to edge - on objects ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "four objects in our sample do have a larger inclination . ngc1023 and ngc4371 are s0-types and contain very little dust and allow an undisturbed view into the bulge region .",
    "the situation is different for ngc3593 and ngc7331 , where the inclination and  in the case of ngc3593  the absence of an optical hst image inhibits a morphological classification .",
    "we present the kinematic data for those objects refrain from classifying them as classical or pseudobulges .",
