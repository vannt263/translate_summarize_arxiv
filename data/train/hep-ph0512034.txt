    "the leading structures of the nucleon in deeply inelastic scattering processes are described in terms of three twist-2 parton distribution functions  the unpolarized @xmath3 , helicity @xmath4 , and transversity @xmath5 distribution .",
    "owing to its chirally odd nature @xmath5 escapes measurement in deeply inelastic scattering experiments which are the main source of information on the chirally even @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the transversity distribution function was originally introduced in the description of the process of dimuon production in high energy collisions of transversely polarized protons @xcite .",
    "alternative processes have been discussed .",
    "let us mention here the collins effect @xcite which , in principle , allows to access @xmath6 in connection with a fragmentation function describing a possible spin dependence of the fragmentation process , see also mulders:1995dh and references therein .",
    "recent and/or future data from semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) experiments at hermes @xcite , clas @xcite and compass legoff : qn could be ( partly ) understood in terms of this effect desanctis:2000fh , ma:2002ns , efremov:2001cz . other processes to access @xmath6 have been suggested as well , see the review barone:2001sp .",
    "however , in all these processes @xmath6 enters in connection with some unknown fragmentation function .",
    "moreover these processes involve the introduction of transverse parton momenta , and for none of them a strict factorization theorem could be formulated so far .",
    "the drell - yan process remains up to now the theoretically cleanest and safest way to access @xmath6 .    the first attempt to study @xmath5 by means of the drell - yan process",
    "is planned at rhic @xcite .",
    "dedicated estimates , however , indicate that at rhic the access of @xmath5 by means of the drell - yan process is very difficult @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the kinematics of the experiment .",
    "the main reason , however , is that the observable double spin asymmetry @xmath7 is proportional to a product of transversity quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "the latter are small , even if they were as large as to saturate the soffer inequality soffer:1994ww which puts a bound on @xmath5 in terms of the better known @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by using an antiproton beam instead of a proton beam .",
    "then @xmath7 is proportional to a product of transversity quark distributions from the proton and transversity antiquark distributions from the antiproton ( which are connected by charge conjugation ) .",
    "thus in this case @xmath7 is due to valence quark distributions , and one can expect sizeable counting rates .",
    "the challenging program how to polarize an antiproton beam has been recently suggested in the * p*olarized * a*ntiproton e*x*periment ( pax ) at gsi @xcite .",
    "the technically realizable polarization of the antiproton beam of about @xmath8 and the large counting rates  due to the use of antiprotons  make the program promising .    in this note",
    "we shall make quantitative estimates for the drell - yan double spin asymmetry @xmath7 in the kinematics of the pax experiment . for that we shall stick to the description of the process at lo qcd .",
    "nlo corrections for @xmath7 have been shown to be small @xcite .",
    "similar estimations were done earlier @xcite using different models for the transversity distribution . here for transversity distribution we shall use the result of the covariant probabilistic model developed earlier @xcite . in this model",
    "the quarks are represented by quasifree fermions on mass shell and their intrinsic motion , which has spherical symmetry and is related to the orbital momentum , is consistently taken into account .",
    "it was shown , that the model nicely reproduces some well - known sum rules .",
    "the calculation was done from the input on unpolarized valence quark distributions @xmath9 and it was shown , that assuming @xmath10 symmetry , a very good agreement with experimental data on the proton spin structure functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be obtained .",
    "in the paper @xcite we discussed the transversity distribution in the mentioned quark - parton ( qpm ) model .",
    "this model , in the limit of massless quarks , implies the relation between the transversity and the corresponding valence quark distribution : @xmath13the factors @xmath14 represent relative contributions to the proton spin from different quark flavors , which for the assumed @xmath10 symmetry means , that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17  depends on the way , in which the transversity is calculated :    _ i ) _ interference effects are attributed to the quark level only , then @xmath18 . in this approach",
    "the relation between the transversity and the usual polarized distribution is obtained@xmath19which means , that the resulting transversity distribution is roughly twice as large as the usual @xmath20 .",
    "the signs of both the distributions are simply correlated .",
    "soffer inequality in this approach is violated for the case of large negative quark polarization , when @xmath21 , which means that the proton @xmath22quarks in the @xmath10 scheme are just on the threshold of violation .",
    "_ ii ) _ interference effects at parton - hadron transition stage are included in addition , but the result represents only upper bound for the transversity . this bound is more strict than the soffer one and roughly speaking , our bound is more restrictive for quarks with  a greater proportion of intrinsic motion and/or smaller ( or negative ) portion in the resulting polarization . no simple correspondence between the signs of actual transversity and @xmath20 follows from this approach . in this scenario : @xmath23 .    following the papers @xcite ,",
    "the transversity can be measured from the drell - yan process @xmath24 @xmath25 in the transversely polarized @xmath26 collisions in the proposed pax experiment .",
    "the transversity can be extracted from the double transverse spin asymmetry@xmath27where , using momenta @xmath28 of the incoming proton@xmath29antiproton pair and the momenta @xmath30 of the outgoing lepton pair , one defines the physical observables @xmath31the variable @xmath32 can be interpreted as the rapidity of lepton pair .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath7 is obtained from the cross sections corresponding to the different combinations of transverse polarizations in the incoming @xmath26 pair@xmath33    rt!.5    where the last expression corresponds to the double spin asymmetry in the qed elementary process , @xmath34 . so using the above formulas",
    ", one can calculate the double spin asymmetry ( [ dy3 ] ) from the valence quark distribution according to the relation ( [ dy1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fi1 ] the result of the calculation is shown .",
    "the normalized input on the proton valence quark distribution was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to @xmath35 and the energy squared of @xmath26 system is taken @xmath36 in an accordance with the assumed pax kinematics . in the same figure the curve obtained at @xmath37 from the calculation @xcite based on the chiral quark - soliton model @xcite is shown for a comparison .",
    "all curves in this figure are based on the same parameterization @xcite of the distribution functions @xmath38 appearing in the denominator in eq .",
    "obviously , our calculation gives a lower estimate of the @xmath7 and one of possible reasons can be the effect of quark intrinsic motion , which , as we have shown , can play role not only for the spin function @xmath11@xcite , but also for the transversity @xmath39 @xcite . in an accordance with @xcite ,  the motion of the lepton pair can be described alternatively with the using the variable @xmath40    rh.5    in the fig .",
    "[ fi2 ] the estimation of asymmetry obtained in the cited paper for @xmath35 and at @xmath41 is compared with our curves from fig .",
    "[ fi1 ] , in which the variable @xmath42 is replaced by the @xmath43 , whereas both the variables are related by the transformation ( [ dy6 ] ) .    apparently , for @xmath44",
    "the curve from @xcite is quite compatible with our results .",
    "so , in both the figures we have the set of curves resulting from different assumptions and the experiment should decide , which one gives the best fit to the data .",
    "how many events is necessary for discriminating among the displayed curves ?",
    "after integrating over angular variables one gets@xmath45then@xmath46which implies@xmath47so for approximate estimate of the statistical error we obtain@xmath48where @xmath49 is number of events related to the bin or interval of @xmath32 or @xmath43 in which the curves are compared .",
    "for example , if one requires @xmath50 , which is error allowing to separate the curves in presented figures , then roughly @xmath51 should be the number of events in the considered bin or interval .",
    "of course , this estimation assumes full polarization of the colliding proton and antiproton .",
    "since the expected polarization of antiprotons at the pax will hardly be better than @xmath8 , the minimum number of events will be correspondingly higher .",
    "the covariant probabilistic qpm , which takes into account intrinsic quark motion , was applied to the calculation of transverse spin asymmetry of dileptons produced in the @xmath26 collisions in the conditions , which are expected for the recently proposed experiment pax .",
    "this asymmetry is directly related to the transversity distributions of quarks inside the proton .  in our asymmetry calculation",
    "the two approaches for the transversity , which differ in accounting for the interference effects , were applied .",
    "our obtained results are compared with the prediction based on the quark - soliton model .",
    "one can observe , that quite different approaches give the similar results , but both our curves are lower than that obtained from the quark - soliton model .",
    "our results for @xmath44 are also well compatible with the recent estimate @xcite .",
