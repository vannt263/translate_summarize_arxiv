    "to date , about 40 molecular species have been identified in nearby external galaxies ( e.g. list available in cdms ; mller et al .",
    "2005 ) . as a result , it is possible to study molecular abundances and chemical reactions in external galaxies .",
    "for example , a difference in molecular abundance has been reported between the nearby starburst galaxies ngc 253 and m 82 ( e.g. mauersberger & henkel 1991 , takano et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the reason for this difference has been discussed .",
    "they suggested that the temperature in ngc 253 is higher than that in m 82 and/or that the size of the high - temperature region in ngc 253 is much larger than that in m 82 .",
    "in addition , takano et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out the peculiarity of the molecular abundance in m 82 among nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "some groups have indicated that the specificity of the molecular abundances of m 82 is because of the chemistry of photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) ( e.g. garca - burillo et al .",
    "2002 ; martn et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "different galaxies have different properties and activities . these include those with small or large amounts of gas , having a starburst and/or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , and with interaction , etc .",
    "molecular line observations of these different galaxies allow us to study the effects of these different properties / activities on the molecular medium .",
    "in fact , some groups have suggested that it is possible to diagnose power sources in dusty galaxies using molecular line ratios ( e.g. kohno et al .",
    "2001 , usero et al . 2004 , kohno 2005 , imanishi et al .",

    "the observation of the molecular gas chemistry of the agn toward ngc 1068 , one of the nearest galaxies with an agn , has been reported by usero et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , prez - beaupuits et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and garca - burillo et al .",
    "they observed molecular lines of hco , h@xmath4co@xmath9 , sio , hco@xmath9 , hoc@xmath9 , and cn , and concluded that the circumnuclear disk of ngc 1068 is a giant x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) .",
    "there are theoretical studies on the xdr model by lepp & dalgarno ( 1996 ) , maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and meijerink et al .",
    "( 2005 ; 2007 ) . however , further systematic observations of molecular lines are indispensable to study the impact of agn on the interstellar medium .",
    "nevertheless , no systematic unbiased scans of millimeter / submillimeter molecular lines toward agn have been published to date , although such scans do exist for two nearby starburst galaxies ( ngc 253 , martn et al .",
    "2006 ; m 82 , naylor et al .",
    "therefore , we started a project to conduct a line survey in the 3-mm band of ngc 1068 using the 45-m telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) in japan .",
    "the beam size of this telescope ( 18@xmath1 at 86 ghz ) is smaller than the size of the circumnuclear starburst ring in ngc 1068 ( d @xmath0 30@xmath1 ; e.g. planesas et al .",
    "1991 ) , and it is therefore essential to study the impact of the agn on the surrounding molecules ; this will enable us to mitigate the contamination of the molecular lines from the circumnuclear starburst region in ngc 1068 .",
    "we also observed ngc 253 to compare the effects of agn on molecular abundance .",
    "this is an on - going project , and we present here the initial results of the survey .    in this study , we report detections of the rotational transition lines of c@xmath2h , cyclic - c@xmath3h@xmath2 , and h@xmath4cn in ngc 1068 , and detection of the c@xmath2h _ n _",
    "= 10 transition in ngc 253 as well as other previously reported lines .",
    "the c@xmath2h molecule was first detected in interstellar clouds by tucker et al .",
    "however , extragalactic detections are limited to just a few objects ( m82 , henkel et al .",
    "1988 ; ngc 4945 , henkel et al . 1990 ; ngc 253 , martn et al .",
    "the c@xmath2h molecule is important to study the formation and the characteristics of carbon - chain molecules , because it is related to the carbon - chain growth .",
    "the cyclic - c@xmath3h@xmath2 molecule has been observed in a large number of galactic sources . in external galaxies ,",
    "it has been detected in cen a ( seaquist & bell 1986 ; bell & seaquist 1988 ) , ngc 253 , and m82 ( mauersberger et al . 1991 ) .",
    "information on the abundances of basic carbon - containing molecules is important to understand the carbon chemistry in ngc 1068 .",
    "the detection of h@xmath4cn in the external galaxies has only been reported toward ngc 253 by mauersberger & henkel ( 1991 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the isotope of hcn was detected in ngc 1068 , because the isotope ratio gives the constraint on the optical depth of the hcn line ; this will help us to unveil the nature of the over - luminous hcn emission at the center of ngc 1068 .",
    "the observations at the 3-mm region ( 85.1  98.4 ghz ) toward ngc 1068 and ngc 253 were carried out from february to may , 2009 and from january to may , 2010 using the 45-m telescope .",
    "the total observational times under good weather condition are 44.5 and 22.5 hours for ngc 1068 and ngc 253 , respectively . the adopted central position and the systemic velocity ( @xmath10 ) of ngc 1068 are @xmath11 = 02 h 42 m 40.798 s , @xmath12 = -00@xmath13 00@xmath14 47.938@xmath1 and 1150 km s@xmath15 , respectively ( schinnerer et al . 2000 ) .",

    "2006 ) and 230 km s@xmath15 ( takano et al .",
    "1995 ) , respectively . in particular , we focused on the cyclic - c@xmath3h@xmath2 _ j@xmath16 _ = 2@xmath171@xmath18 ( @xmath19 = 85.338906 ghz ) , h@xmath4cn _ j _ = 10 ( @xmath19 = 86.340167 ghz , _ f _ = 21 ) , c@xmath2h _ n _ = 10 ( @xmath19 = 87.316925 ghz , _ j _ = 3/21/2 , _ f _ = 21 ) , hcn _ j _ = 10 ( @xmath19 = 88.631847 ghz , _ f _ = 21 ) , ch@xmath3oh _ j_@xmath20 = 2@xmath201@xmath20 ( @xmath19 = 96.741377 ghz , _ j_@xmath20 = 2@xmath211@xmath21",

    "these rest frequencies were taken from the database of lovas ( 2004 ) .    the dual - polarization sideband - separating receiver ( nakajima et al .",

    "2010 ) , which employs an artificial signal injection from the top of the receiver optics .",
    "the half - power beam widths ( hpbws ) at 86 ghz were 18.3@xmath1 and 18.4@xmath1 for h - polarization ( h - pol . ) and v - polarization ( v - pol . ) , respectively , in 2009 , and 19.2@xmath1 and 18.9@xmath1 for h - pol . and v - pol .",

    "the backend used consisted of eight digital spectrometers ( sorai et al .",

    "we used four spectrometers for each polarization , lined up in the direction of frequency .",
    "the line intensities were calibrated by the chopper wheel method .",

    "the pointing accuracy was better than about 5@xmath1 .",
    "the position - switching mode was employed for the observations where the reference position was taken at the position with an azimuthal angle difference of + 5@xmath14 for both galaxies .",
    "the integration time on each position was 20 sec .",
    "the main results include detections of c@xmath2h , cyclic - c@xmath3h@xmath2 , and h@xmath4cn toward ngc 1068 and the c@xmath2h _ n _ = 10 transition toward ngc 253 .",

    "nonetheless , we detected this transition in ngc 1068 using a single dish telescope .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the observed line profiles , and table 1 summarizes the parameters derived from the gaussian fits to the observed lines .",

    "we detected two fine structure components because of the line blending .",
    "thus , the fitting has been carried out with a comb of gaussian profiles at the rest frequencies of the hyperfine components ( gottlieb et al .",
    "1983 ) using the same widths and with fixed optical depths ( @xmath25 ) ratios relative to the main component based on the theoretical relative intensities ( tucker et al .",
    "the width of the components and the optical depth were taken as free parameters .",
    "the main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath26 ) can be calculated from the following equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 the beam filling factor , @xmath29 = @xmath30 / ( @xmath30 + @xmath31 ) , accounts for the dilution effect due to the coupling between the source and the telescope beam in the approximation of a gaussian source distribution of size @xmath32 ( fwhm ) that is observed with a gaussian beam size @xmath33 ( hpbw ) .",
    "the adopted @xmath32 of ngc 1068 is 4@xmath1 , which is assumed from the distribution of hcn ( helfer & britz 1995 ; krips et al .",

    "we observed the c@xmath2h lines only in 2009 , and @xmath33 was measured to be @xmath0 18.4@xmath1 at 86 ghz in 2009 .",
    "thus , for the c@xmath2h observation , the values of @xmath29 for ngc 1068 and ngc 253 with the 45-m telescope are 0.045 and 0.54 , respectively .",
    "we assumed the excitation temperatures ( @xmath34 ) toward ngc 1068 to be 7.6 k , which is derived from the analysis of the rotation diagram of the cs lines ( see subsection 3.3 ) , and that toward ngc 253 to be 5.8 k , which is derived from the analysis of the rotation diagram of the c@xmath2h lines ( see after the next paragraph ) .",
    "the employed cosmic background radiation ( @xmath35 ) is 2.7 k. the fitting results were overlaid on the spectra ( figure 2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . the gaussian profiles for c@xmath2h in ngc 253",
    "do not reproduce the observed spectrum well . the peak position of the main component seems to be shifted possibly because of the self - absorption effect .",
    "because of this shift , the overall fitting results are not as good as those of ngc 1068 .",
    "we obtained the optical depth of the c@xmath2h main component ( _ n _",
    "= 10 , _ j _ = 3/21/2 , _ f _ = 21 ) of ngc 1068 and ngc 253 to be 0.06 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "the total of the optical depth of all the c@xmath2h components in both galaxies are 0.15 and 0.13 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the c@xmath2h _ n _",

    "if the source size of ngc 1068 is changed to 10@xmath1 , to be able to see the effect of the assumed source size , then @xmath34 becomes 8.5 k. in this case , the optical depth is calculated to be 0.01 .",
    "therefore , the result of the small optical depth of c@xmath2h is rather robust considering the uncertainty of the assumed source size .",
    "the obtained column densities of c@xmath2h in ngc 1068 and ngc 253 are 3.4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 and 1.8 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "<S> we used the nobeyama 45-m telescope to conduct a spectral line survey in the 3-mm band ( 85.198.4 ghz ) toward one of the nearest galaxies with active galactic nucleus ngc 1068 and the prototypical starburst galaxy ngc 253 . </S>",
    "<S> the beam size of this telescope is @xmath0 18@xmath1 , which was sufficient to spatially separate the nuclear molecular emission from the emission of the circumnuclear starburst region in ngc 1068 . </S>",
    "<S> we detected rotational transitions of c@xmath2h , cyclic - c@xmath3h@xmath2 , and h@xmath4cn in ngc 1068 . </S>",
