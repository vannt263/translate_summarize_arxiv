    "in this article , we are interested in uniqueness results for different types of problems which can be written as nonlocal hamilton - jacobi equations of the following form : @xmath0(x , t)|d u|\\quad \\hbox { in   } { { \\mathbb r}}^n \\times ( 0,t)\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the solution @xmath3 is a real - valued function , @xmath4 and@xmath5 stand respectively for its time and space derivatives and @xmath6 is the indicator function of a set @xmath7 . finally @xmath8 is a bounded , lipschitz continuous function .    for any indicator function @xmath9 or more generally for any @xmath10 with @xmath11 a.e .",
    ", the function @xmath12 $ ] depends on @xmath9 in a nonlocal way and , in the main examples we have in mind , it is obtained from @xmath9 through a convolution type procedure ( either only in space or in space and time ) .",
    "in particular , in our framework , despite the fact that @xmath9 has no regularity neither in @xmath13 nor in @xmath14 , @xmath12 $ ] will be always lipschitz continuous in @xmath13 ; on the contrary we impose no regularity with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely we always assume in the sequel that , for any @xmath9 , the velocity @xmath15 $ ] satisfies    * ( h1 ) * for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 is measurable and there exist @xmath18 such that , for all @xmath19 and @xmath20,$ ] @xmath21 we will come back to this assumption later on .    to give a first flavor of our main uniqueness results",
    ", we can point out the following key facts : equation ( [ dyseqn ] ) can be seen as the `` level - set approach''-equation associated to the motion of the front @xmath22 with the nonlocal velocity @xmath23.$ ] however , in the non - standard examples we consider , it is not only a nonlocal but also non - monotone `` geometrical '' equation ; by non - monotone we mean that the inclusion principle , which plays a central role in the `` level - set approach '' , does not hold and , therefore , the uniqueness of solutions can not be proved via standard viscosity solutions methods .    in fact ,",
    "the few uniqueness results which exist in the literature ( see below ) rely on @xmath24 type estimates on the solution ; this is natural since one has to connect the continuous function @xmath3 and the indicator function @xmath25 .",
    "the main estimates concern measures of sets of the type @xmath26 for @xmath27 close to @xmath28 . whether or not the aforementioned estimate has to be uniform on time , or of integral type , strongly depends on the properties of the convolution kernel . in order to emphasize this fact",
    ", we are going to concentrate on two model cases : the first one is a dislocation type equation ( see section [ sec : mod1 ] ) in which the kernel belongs to @xmath29 while the second one is related to the fitzhugh - nagumo system arising in neural wave propagation or in chemical kinetics in which the kernel is essentially the kernel of the heat equation ( see section [ sec : mod2 ] ) . in that case , it is not in @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that the convolution kernel is , or is not , bounded is indeed _ the _ key difference here .    before going further ,",
    "let us give some references : for the first model case ( dislocation type equations ) , we refer the reader to barles , cardaliaguet , ley and monneau @xcite where general results are provided for these equations .",
    "we point out  and we will come back to this fact later  that uniqueness in the non - monotone case was first obtained by alvarez , cardaliaguet and monneau @xcite and then by barles and ley @xcite using different arguments ; we also refer to rodney , le bouar and finel @xcite for the physical background on these equations .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo system has been investigated in particular by giga , goto and ishii @xcite , and by soravia and souganidis @xcite .",
    "they provided a notion of weak solution for this system ( see below ) and proved existence of such weak solutions .",
    "they also study the connections with the phase field model ( a reaction - diffusion system which leads to such a front propagation model ) .",
    "however the uniqueness question has been left open until now .",
    "+ let us return to the key steps to prove uniqueness for ( [ dyseqn])-([iddyseqn ] ) .",
    "a major issue is the properties of the solutions of the eikonal equations of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a continuous function , satisfying suitable assumptions .",
    "of course , such partial differential equations appear naturally when considering @xmath25 as an a priori given function .",
    "we recall that this equation is related via the level - set approach to the motion of fronts with a @xmath32-dependent normal velocity @xmath33 and to deal with compact fronts and to simplify matter , we assume that the initial datum satisfies the following conditions : the subset @xmath34 is non empty and there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath36 this implies , in particular , that the initial front @xmath37 is a non empty compact subset of @xmath38 .",
    "assumption * ( h1 ) * ensures existence and uniqueness of a solutions to but we also assume that the function @xmath15 $ ] is positive ( and even strictly positive ) , together with    * ( h2 ) * there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath40 the above assumption implies that the set @xmath41 has a zero lebesgue measure ( cf .",
    "ley @xcite ) which is an important property for our arguments .",
    "indeed @xcite provides a counter - example ( even in a ( quasi ) monotone case ) where fattening phenomena leads to a non - uniqueness feature for a nonlocal equation .",
    "in addition to this non - fattening property , a key consequence of * ( h1)*-*(h2 ) * is a lower bound on the gradient @xmath5 on a set @xmath42 for a small enough @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now concentrate on the estimates of the measures of the volume of sets like @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "we first note that such estimates are related with perimeter estimates of the @xmath46 level - sets of @xmath3 for @xmath46 close to @xmath28 ( typically @xmath47 ) : indeed , combining the co - area formula with the lower bound on the gradient of the solution , we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lower bound on @xmath50 on the set @xmath42 .    in @xcite and @xcite , perimeter estimates for the @xmath46 level - sets of @xmath3",
    "were obtained by using bounds on the curvatures of these sets .",
    "although this approach was powerful , it has the drawback to require strong assumptions on the dependence in @xmath13 of @xmath12 $ ] ( typically a @xmath51 regularity )",
    ". unfortunately such strong regularity does not always hold : for instance it is not the case for the fitzhugh - nagumo system .",
    "the key contribution of this paper is to provide @xmath52)$ ] or @xmath53)$ ] estimates of the volume of the set @xmath44 ( or , almost equivalently , of the perimeter of the @xmath46 level - sets of @xmath3 ) in situations where the velocity @xmath12 $ ] is less regular in @xmath13 . as a consequence we are able to prove new uniqueness results .    for the dislocation dynamics model",
    ", our approach allows to relax the assumptions of @xcite and @xcite on the data .",
    "the proofs are also simpler , requiring only @xmath52)$ ] estimates and a mild regularity ( @xmath12 $ ] is merely measurable in time and lipschitz continuous in space ) .",
    "so the main conclusion here is that  soft \" estimates are sufficient provided the convolution kernel is in @xmath29 .    on the contrary , for the fitzhugh - nagumo system , where the convolution kernel is unbounded , these @xmath24-estimates are no more sufficient and the uniqueness proof rather requires heavy @xmath29-estimates on the perimeter .",
    "these estimates are obtained by establishing , through optimal control type arguments , that the set @xmath54 satisfies a uniform  interior cone property \" , from which we deduce ( explicit ) estimates on the perimeter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : existence ] , we recall the notion of weak solution for introduced in @xcite . in section  [ sec : mod1 ] we prove uniqueness of the solution for the dislocation type equation , while we deal with the fitzhugh - nagumo case in section  [ sec : mod2 ] .",
    "the main technical results of this paper are gathered in section  [ auxil ] : we recall here some useful results for the eikonal equation , we show the interior cone property and deduce the uniform perimeter estimates . +",
