    "the fact , that a field of @xmath47 in the mfc measurement discussed above is sufficient to achieve a significant polarization of the superparamagnetic nanoclusters easily accounts for the higher signal intensity of the ac susceptibility measurement with the ac field @xmath201  mt in comparison to the behavior observed for the sample @xmath5 with lower mn concentration .",
    "we would expect a curie temperature for the nanoclusters depending on their respective mn concentration . from the decrease of @xmath80 for increasing temperatures above @xmath202  k , as well as from magnetization in the mfc , fc , and zfc measurements",
    ", we deduce a characteristic ferromagnetic transition temperature of most of the superparamagnetic nanoclusters in the temperature range 115  k @xmath203  k. the ferromagnetic phase transition of the nanoclusters might also explain the peak in @xmath204 .",
    "a comparison of the shape of the zfc and @xmath80 curves of both samples suggests , that for the sample @xmath5 the average mn concentration of the nanoclusters is shifted to a lower value , accompanied by a decrease of their average curie temperature .    the onset of the decay of @xmath80 on the low temperature side of the plateau - like signal we attribute to the freezing temperature @xmath96 of the ac susceptibility measurement performed with frequency @xmath8 . for decreasing @xmath8 ,",

    "@xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the magnetization data by an onset of local ferromagnetism below a first transition temperature and the transition to a frozen , glassy state at a lower temperature due to cluster freezing is similar to the scenario reported for a so - called cluster glass material .",

    "in cluster glass materials , a two - peak structure in the susceptibility measurements was observed.@xcite the peak in the susceptibility occurring at the higher temperature was assigned to be an indication for the formation of ferromagnetic clusters , whereas the low temperature peak was attributed to cluster freezing in the sample.@xcite the temperature of the ac susceptibility peak of @xmath11 ( @xmath208 ) is indeed close to the value of @xmath209 , determined from the temperature below which the formation of bmps is supposed to set in following li _",

    "however , the position of the high temperature peak observed by freitas _ et al._,@xcite which is thought to correspond to the local onset of ferromagnetism within the clusters , was found to be independent of frequency in contrast to the weak frequency dependence detected here . therefore , the ac behavior exhibited by the ge : mn samples studied here is not completely identical to that reported for @xmath160 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have extensively studied the magnetic properties of -mn with a focus on the low temperature state using three different methods spanning seven orders of magnitude in time scales . instead of a ferromagnetic percolation transition,@xcite we clearly find a glassy state below @xmath1  k and @xmath2  k , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , only slightly depending on the mn concentration .",
