    "although preserved in the paramagnetic case ( within the statistical errors ) , completely disappears in the magnetic case . even in the paramagnetic case and for weak disorder , there are differences with respect to the clean case : first , the initial pair creation rate jumps to a finite value , which in the range of electric fields used in the computations , appears to be independent of the electric field ; second , in spite of the superposition of the scaled curves ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ f:7]b ) , the characteristic straight line behavior as a function of time is much shorter than in the clean case .    in comparison with the paramagnetic case ,",
    "we note that the current traversing a magnetically polarized medium is reduced by a factor of about @xmath121 , for a given electric field ( fig .",
    "[ f:7]c ) . simultaneously and at first sight paradoxically , the number of pairs , and therefore the number of carriers , rapidly increases during an initial transient .",
    "concomitantly , the spreading of the wave function is almost ballistic , in this weak to intermediate disorder strength regime ( cf .",

    "these observations show that we are in the presence of a regime characterized by an initial rapid spreading of the density probability , to which the pair creation rate is proportional , in conjunction with a slow displacement of its mean value , which determines the current .",
    "in addition , the absence of a definite power law in the current - electric field characteristics , in particular for the weaker electric fields @xmath123 ( cyan line ) , can be related to the behavior of the number of pairs that tends to saturate .",
    "therefore , in the magnetic case , the current driven by polarization dominates over the pair production term , erasing the power law dependency on the electric field .    to study the influence of the magnetic disorder on the current and pair production , we fixed the electric field at @xmath124 , and varied @xmath23 between the clean value @xmath125 to a moderated disorder strength @xmath126 , limit of the ballistic regime ( figs .",

    "we note that for a disorder strength of about @xmath127 ( line 5 ) , the current and pair production rate tend to saturate to a constant value ( independent of time ) , after an initial transient regime . increasing the disorder",
    "the current does not vanish , but appears to converge ( within the large fluctuation errors ) to a constant independent of @xmath23 .",
    "it is important to recall that the initial state is always at zero energy , that is in the energy gap open by the magnetic impurities ( cf .",

    "this asymptotic value depends on the electric field .",
    "the pair production rate appears to be less influenced by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the pair production is computed in the comoving frame ( the one in which @xmath128 is constant ) , and then it is not sensitive to the phase of the wave function at variance with the current .",
    "after an initial transient @xmath129 saturates to a value proportional to the disorder amplitude .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the schwinger mechanism that would give a rate exponentially small in the energy gap ; for strong magnetic disorder the production of electron states from the initial hole state is arguably due to scattering off impurities and not directly related to the electric field intensity ( as can be observed in fig .",

    "simultaneously the number of pairs increases proportionally to the disorder strength .",
    "the observed complex behavior of the wave packet and the peculiar properties of the current in the presence of polarized magnetic impurities , can not be simply explained by the mechanisms of ballistic transport and electron - hole production in a strong electric field , suitable for the paramagnetic case .",
    "the fact that a gap is open and that a current weakly dependent on the exchange constant for strong enough disorder persists at long times , are indicative of interesting localization properties and highly inhomogeneous electronic states .",
