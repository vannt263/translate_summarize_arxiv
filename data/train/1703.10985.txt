    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) are van der waals ( vdw ) compounds that follow the general formula of mx@xmath0 , where m is a transition metal from groups ivb - vib , and x is a group viia chalcogen , such as s , se , and te .",
    "this chemical versatility leads to unique electronic properties , such as semiconducting behavior @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , and topological electronic states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , two - dimensional ( 2d ) tmd monolayers can be vertically stacked without the need for lattice matching , which allows these dissimilar electronic phases to be combined in a single heterostructure @xcite .    the chemical versatility intrinsic to tmds and the novel interactions achieved through vdw stacking are complimented further by the structural polymorphism of tmds .",
    "a prototypical example is molybdenum ditelluride ( mote@xmath0 ) , which can be grown in a semiconducting 2h phase ( space group p6@xmath5/mmc ) or a semimetallic 1t@xmath1 phase ( space group p2@xmath6/m ) @xcite .",
    "the hexagonal 2h phase , characterized by a trigonal prismatic coordination , is thermodynamically stable under ambient conditions , while the monoclinic 1t@xmath1 phase is stable above 900 @xmath7c .",
    "the 1t@xmath1 phase can be stabilized at room temperature by rapid cooling @xcite , control of the tellurization rate of mo films @xcite , or choosing appropriate precursors for chemical vapor deposition @xcite . when cooled below @xmath8250",
    "k , 1t@xmath1-mote@xmath0 transitions into an orthorhombic t@xmath2 phase ( space group pmn2@xmath6 ) with broken inversion symmetry as evidenced by electrical , structural , and optical measurements @xcite .",
    "interest in mote@xmath0 has surged due to the unique electronic properties of its structural phases as well as the possibility of engineering controlled transitions between these phases .",
    "for instance ,",
    "type - ii weyl semimetal states were theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in both t@xmath2-mote@xmath0 and t@xmath2-wte@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the broken inversion symmetry of the t@xmath2 phase is a necessary condition for the type - ii weyl state @xcite and allows for fundamental studies of interesting topological physics .",
    "however , efforts to directly observe the weyl state using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy are frustrated by the presence of overlapping band - crossings and insufficient experimental resolution @xcite .",
    "a more practical application driving investigations of mote@xmath0 is the development of atomically thin phase change memory .",
    "mote@xmath0 has a small energy difference between the 2h and 1t@xmath1 phases , making the prospect of engineering on - demand transitions with low power consumption realistic @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , reversible and rapid phase changes in mote@xmath0 have yet to be demonstrated .",
    "this may suggest that the energy difference between the 2h and 1t@xmath1 phases must be reduced further in order to successfully perform phase change operations .",
    "the limitations of mote@xmath0 highlighted above can be addressed by alloy engineering .",
    "substitutional doping of mo with w atoms results in mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys which have properties advantageous for both fundamental investigations and practical applications .",
    "mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys have been theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally confirmed @xcite to be type - ii weyl semimetals .",
    "importantly , the separation of the weyl nodes in the alloys can be tuned with composition @xcite , which facilitates the observation of topological electronic states .",
    "additionally , the ground state energy difference between the semiconducting 2h and semimetallic 1t@xmath1 or t@xmath2 phases in mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys can also be tuned with composition @xcite , thereby reducing the energy required to trigger a semiconductor - semimetal phase transformation .",
    "the desirable combination of tunable phase transitions with the low - dimensionality of tmds makes mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 highly promising for phase change memory applications .",
    "further application of the mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloy system necessitates an understanding of the compositional dependence of phase transformations and the impact of disorder upon the material properties .",
    "the literature on this subject is very limited . in a pioneering work on mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 polycrystalline powders , revolinsky and",
    "beerntsen found that the alloys crystallize in the 2h phase for x @xmath9 0.15 , the t@xmath2 phase for x @xmath10 0.65 , and a two - phase region of 2h + 1t@xmath1 in between @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", champion detected a two - phase 2h + t@xmath2 region only for x = 0.25 composition , whereas a higher ( lower ) w content resulted in mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 powders in a t@xmath2 ( 2h ) phase , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , no detailed structural studies were reported in these two papers to shed light on the co - existence of the 2h and t@xmath2 phases , especially considering a noticeable difference in their symmetry .",
    "recently , rhodes et al . reported a simplified phase diagram without two - phase regions for single - crystalline mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys grown by the chemical vapor transport method ( cvt ) @xcite .",
    "finally , lv et al . suggested that a mixed 1t@xmath1 + t@xmath2 region exists for 0.5 @xmath11 x @xmath11 0.7 based on raman measurements @xcite .",
    "this significant disagreement between the studies about phase boundaries between the phases in the mote@xmath0-wte@xmath0 system , combined with the absence of comprehensive studies of compositional disorder on optical properties , calls for a fresh look at this alloy system .    here , we address these disagreements in the literature by combining x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) , density - functional theory ( dft ) , and polarization - resolved raman spectroscopy to explore the properties of the 1t@xmath1 , t@xmath2 , and 2h structural phases in the mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 crystals grown by iodine - assisted cvt .",
    "xrd and stem measurements indicate that the mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys with the 1t@xmath1 crystal structure are stable at elevated temperatures with w content x @xmath9 0.04 , while alloys with the t@xmath2 structure are stable for x @xmath10 0.63 . the alloys with intermediate compositions 0.04 @xmath11 x @xmath11 0.63 form a two - phase , 1t@xmath1 + t@xmath2 , mixture .",
    "polarized raman measurements offer further insight into the transition from 1t@xmath1 to the two - phase , 1t@xmath1 + t@xmath2 , field and ultimately to the t@xmath2 single - phase region as a function of x. we use raman tensor analysis to assign the phonon mode symmetry for all compositions and find that the tensor elements must be complex in order to capture the polarization dependence .",
    "this observation is consistent with prior studies of mote@xmath0 @xcite as well as studies of other layered tmd materials @xcite .",
    "the raman peaks for certain phonon modes show particular sensitivity to x and lattice symmetry .",
    "for example , the raman peak at 128 @xmath12 for the 1t@xmath1-mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys broadens at @xmath13 and splits into a doublet for compositions x @xmath10 0.29 , which implies a loss of inversion symmetry @xcite due to the substitution of mo by w. we also observe the activation of a new raman mode at 178 @xmath12 that is unique to @xmath14 alloys .",
    "based on our dft calculations , we assign this feature as a disorder - activated infrared mode in mote@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the separation between the two modes near 260 @xmath12 in mote@xmath0 is highly composition - dependent and can be used to infer x. in 2h - mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 , we observe minor changes in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mode frequencies , linewidths , and relative intensities .",
    "we also identify a new raman mode at 202  @xmath12 that originates from a double - resonance raman process @xcite and is apparently enhanced by alloy disorder .",

    "the separation between these two peaks is presented versus composition in figure  [ compdep](c ) and illustrates the appearance and evolution of the doublet , which persists into the @xmath60 ( pure wte@xmath0 ) case but with a smaller peak separation .",
    "temperature - dependent electrical and xrd measurements have previously shown that mote@xmath0 undergoes a temperature - induced phase transition from the 1t@xmath1 to t@xmath2 crystal structure when cooled below 250 k @xcite .",
    "recent temperature - dependent raman measurements in ref.@xcite have also demonstrated that the @xmath50 mode at 128 @xmath12 in mote@xmath0 splits into a doublet with @xmath51 mode symmetry due to inversion - symmetry breaking upon transitioning into the t@xmath2 phase at low temperatures .",
    "our xrd measurements identify the @xmath61 region as two - phase , and therefore we can not interpret the appearance of the doublet as signifying a phase transition from 1t@xmath1 to t@xmath2 .",
    "instead , we attribute the doublet to the breakdown of inversion symmetry in the 1t@xmath1-mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys , which originates not from a 1t@xmath1 @xmath38 t@xmath2 phase transition , but instead from the random substitution of mo atoms with w atoms .",
    "alloying therefore provides a means of destroying inversion symmetry without eliminating the 1t@xmath1 phase . from these observations",

    "the mote@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 peaks appear to faithfully track the removal and addition of each atomic species , while the disorder mode appears at x = 0.02 , peaks at x = 0.33 , and disappears at x = 1 .",
    "the observed frequency agrees with an infrared - active , but raman - forbidden , @xmath58 mode at 177  @xmath12 predicted by our dft calculations ( table [ modetable ] ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the disorder mode originates from an infrared mode that is activated by the loss of translation symmetry in the lattice .",
    "the combined effects of lattice disorder and reduced mo content at large x values drives the mode to reach its maximum intensity at x = 0.33 , which also is the point where the ratio of the normalized intensities of the mote@xmath0 peak to the wte@xmath0 peak approach unity . we note that similar activations of infrared modes by alloy disorder have been previously observed , particularly in ga@xmath41al@xmath62as @xcite .    given the non - destructive nature and wide - spread use of raman spectroscopy , it is desirable to determine alloy composition using a raman - based method .",
    "the mote@xmath0 raman modes present near 260  @xmath12 ( box iii , figure  [ introraman](f ) ) provide a potential measure of the alloy composition , which we demonstrate in figures  [ compdep](e , f ) . we observe a pair of broad raman modes near 260  @xmath12 in mote@xmath0 that are assigned as @xmath50 modes ( box iii of figure  [ introraman](f ) and figure  [ compdep](e ) ) and",

    "finally , we examine the primary wte@xmath0 peak at 212  @xmath12 which is broad and asymmetric upon its appearance at @xmath64 , but sharpens as @xmath65 ( figure  [ compdep](b ) ) .",
    "we magnify this feature in figure  [ scm](a ) for select compositions .",
    "the asymmetric lineshape of the 212  @xmath12 peak provides valuable information regarding the incorporation of w into the mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 lattice .",
    "we find that the asymmetry of this feature and its evolution with x can be well understood in the context of the phonon confinement model , also referred to as the spatial correlation model @xcite .",
    "the phonon confinement model accounts for relaxation of the @xmath66 raman selection rule by multiplying the lorentzian function , used to represent standard raman peaks in a pure crystal , with a gaussian function of the form @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the intensity @xmath68 of raman peaks in the phonon confinement model is given by @xcite    @xmath69}^2 + { ( \\gamma_{0}/2 ) } ^2}}\\text { } , \\label{pcm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is in units of @xmath70 , @xmath71  , @xmath72  , and @xmath73  are the dft - relaxed lattice parameters of wte@xmath0 , @xmath74 @xmath12 is the full width at half maximum of the w peak for composition @xmath60 , @xmath75 is the dispersion relation which we calculate from dft and shift to match the experimental value of @xmath76 ( figure s1 of the supporting information ) , and @xmath77 is the phonon correlation length . in a pure crystal , @xmath77 is infinite due to the translational symmetry of the lattice and results in plane wave eigenstates .",
    "the gaussian factor in equation , in this case , is zero for all @xmath32 except the @xmath31 point , and therefore the @xmath66 raman selection rule is preserved .",
    "however , mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys exhibit potential fluctuations due to the substitutional doping on the transition metal sublattice .",
    "the random positioning of the dopant atoms destroys translational symmetry in the crystal , thereby yielding a finite @xmath77 and relaxing the @xmath66 raman selection rule .",
    "we fit the 212  @xmath12 w peak for x @xmath10 0.29 in background - subtracted raman spectra with this model ( red lines in figure  [ scm](a ) ) using experimentally - derived parameters and the dft calculated phonon dispersion .",
    "the extracted phonon correlation length @xmath77 is plotted versus x in figure  [ scm](b ) , and is found to increase rapidly with x.    we now comment on the raman spectra of 2h - mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 ( @xmath78 ) , which are shown in figure  [ hraman](a ) . the @xmath15 ( 173  @xmath12 ) , @xmath16 ( 234  @xmath12 ) , and @xmath79 ( 289  @xmath12 ) modes are visible in all compounds ( figure  [ hraman](a ) ) and exhibit only small changes .",
    "the shifts in mode frequency and linewidth for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes are summarized in figures  [ hraman](b , c ) . for @xmath13 , we find that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes develop asymmetric tails on the low and high energy sides of the peak , respectively .",
    "this asymmetry originates from a finite phonon correlation length as discussed previously and we note that the direction of the tail for each mode is consistent with the phonon dispersions of 2h - mote@xmath0 @xcite . in addition",
    ", we identify a feature appearing at 202  @xmath12 for @xmath80 alloys which we assign as a double - resonance raman mode originating from the scattering of two longitudinal acoustic phonons from the @xmath81-point or an @xmath82 and a transverse acoustic mode , both also from the @xmath81 point @xcite .",
    "this feature has only been observed in few - layer 2h - mote@xmath0 under resonant excitation @xcite , and its appearance in the bulk alloy samples is believed to originate from an enhancement in @xmath83 raman scattering processes by compositional disorder in the lattice .",
    "we have used xrd , stem , dft , and raman spectroscopy to characterize the different crystal phases spanned by the mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloy system .",
    "xrd and stem measurements determined that 1t@xmath1/t@xmath2-mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys are in the 1t@xmath1 phase for @xmath84 and the t@xmath2 phase for @xmath85 . for compositions",
    "@xmath86 , mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 exists in a 1t@xmath1 + t@xmath2 two - phase mixture .",
    "raman measurements enable the assignment of phonon mode symmetries across the compositional phase space and permit the observation of a new disorder - activated mode unique to mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys .",
    "furthermore , we find that inversion symmetry breaking in the 1t@xmath1 phase can occur without transitioning to an orthorhombic configuration by monitoring the splitting of the 128 @xmath12 peak . finally , we find that the asymmetry of the primary wte@xmath0 peak can be captured by the phonon confinement model , which in turn allows for the determination of the phonon correlation length .",
    "our studies of the 2h phase show small changes in mode frequencies with x and provide evidence for disorder enhancement of double - resonance raman scattering processes .",
    "these measurements are foundational for future studies seeking to explore the electronic , vibrational , or topological properties of mo@xmath3w@xmath4te@xmath0 alloys .",
