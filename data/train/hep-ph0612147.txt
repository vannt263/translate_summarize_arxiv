    "one of the most relevant topic in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions is the interaction of charmonium with nuclear matter , since the charmonium suppression is one of the most evident signals of formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",

    "it is important to understand the two different ways of charmonium absorption : by the nucleons and by the co - mover light mesons ( @xmath2 , etc ... ) . calculations of form factors and coupling constants related with charmed and light mesons are of great importance in evaluating charmonium cross sections @xcite .",
    "recent results of babar , cleo , belle and selex on @xmath3 mesons spectroscopy stimulate calculations of physical quantities like vertices involving @xmath3 mesons @xcite .    in the low energy regime ( @xmath4 10gev )",
    ", theoretical studies are performed mainly through the use of effective lagrangians . in this context ,",
    "one has a good control of the relevant symmetries that underly the dynamics of the process . on the other hand ,",
    "it is necessary to know the values of form factors  associated with the vertices  with some precision .",
    "the choice of a lower or higher value of the form factor may change the final cross section in some orders of magnitude .    in refs .",
    "@xcite effective models for @xmath1 absorption in hadronic matter are proposed .",
    "the lagrangians involve charmed and light pseudoscalar mesons ( p ) and also vector mesons ( v ) .",
    "the interaction among these particles occurs through three ",
    "point ( ppv and vvv ) and four  point ( ppvv and vvvv ) vertices .",
    "one possible vertex in some of these models involves one @xmath5 and two @xmath3 mesons .",
    "on the other hand , in the framework of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , one can obtain the value of the coupling constant ( at zero momentum transfer ) for such a vertex as @xmath6 ( appendix a of @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) method @xcite have been used in many works to calculate cross - sections , form factors and coupling constants ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
