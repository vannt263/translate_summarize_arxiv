    "it has been argued that stoner magnetism with high @xmath1 originates from the spin - polarized extended states induced by the vacancy defects , while rkky coupling is suppressed .",
    "these effects of defects on 1d semiconducting graphene nanoribbons should be more complex and interesting , because their band gap , magnetic state and symmetry are expected to intervene .",
    "present study based on extensive first - principles as well as empirical tight - binding calculations ( etb ) has shown that the band gap and magnetic state of any armchair or zigzag nanoribbons can be modified by single or multiple vacancies ( holes ) .",
    "the effects of these defects depend on their symmetry , repeating periodicity and positions .",
    "even if the formation of periodic defects of desired symmetry may not easily be achieved , similar effects can be created through the potential difference across a ribbon applied by periodically arranged tips . when combined with various properties of nanoribbons these results",
    "can initiate a number of interesting applications .",
    "we believe that our results are important for further studies , since the graphene ribbons can now be produced with precision having widths sub 10 nm@xcite and nanodevices can be fabricated thereof@xcite .",
    "we have performed first - principles plane wave calculations within density functional theory ( dft ) using paw potentials @xcite .",

    "the band gap@xcite , @xmath4 , of a bare or hydrogen terminated agnr(@xmath3 ) is small for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being an integer ) , but from @xmath7 to @xmath8 it increases and passing through a maximum it becomes again small at the next minimum corresponding to @xmath9 . as @xmath4 oscillates with @xmath3 its value shall decrease eventually to zero as @xmath10 .",
    "bare and hydrogen terminated zigzag nanoribbons , zgnr(@xmath3 ) , are also semiconductors with @xmath4 decreasing consistently as @xmath3 increases for @xmath118 , but their edge states give rise to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state@xcite .",
    "we will show that these magnetic and electronic properties can be modified by defects originating from vacancies or holes created in those ribbons .",
    "a hole can be created when carbon atoms at the corners of any hexagon of an armchair ribbon are removed and subsequently remaining six two - fold coordinated carbon atoms are terminated with hydrogen atoms .",
    "figure  [ fig:1-a ] ( a ) - ( b ) shows that the electronic structure of agnr(@xmath12 ) is strongly modified by such a hole which is placed at the center of the ribbon .",
    "the hole repeats itself at each supercell which comprises six primitive cells corresponding to a repeat period of @xmath13=6 .",
    "this ribbon having a periodic hole ( or defect ) is specified as agnr(@xmath3;@xmath13 ) and has non - magnetic ground state . despite large separation of periodic defect which hinders their direct coupling",
    "such a strong modification of the band gap is somehow unexpected .",
    "however , it is an indirect effect and occurs since the itinerant ( bloch ) states of band edges are modified by the defect . at the end , the direct band gap@xcite at the @xmath14-point has widened from 0.09 ev to 0.40 ev due to a defect situated at the center of the ribbon .",
    "agnr ( 36 ) exhibit the same behavior ; namely its band gap increases when a similar hole repeats itself at each supercell consisting of six primitive cell .",
    "however , in contrast , the band gap of agnr(38 ) , which is normally larger than that of agnr(34 ) , is reduced if the same hole is introduced at its center .",
    "in addition , states localized around the defect have formed flat bands near the edge of valence and conduction bands because of their reduced coupling .    moreover , the effect of this defect is strongly dependent on its position relative to the both edges of the nanoribbon as depicted in fig .",

    "as shown in fig  [ fig:1-b ] ( d ) , the effects of defect decrease with increasing repeat periodicity @xmath13 .",
    "we found that larger holes with different geometry and rotation symmetry can result in diverse electronic structure and confined states .",

    "we now show that different types of vacancies in the same armchair nanoribbon gives rise to different changes in electronic and magnetic properties . a divacancy created in agnr(22 )",

    "[ fig:2 ] ( a ) we see that the non - magnetic and semiconducting agnr(22 ) with band gap of @xmath22=0.18 ev becomes a non - magnetic metal , since a flat band derived from the defect occurs below the top of the valance band edge and causes to a metallic state .",
    "the effect of a single carbon vacancy becomes even more interesting .",
    "a single vacancy created in agnr(22 ) is relaxed and the three - fold rotation symmetry is broken due to jahn - teller distortion . at the end , a nine - sided ring forms adjacent to a pentagon as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ( b ) .",
    "because of unbalanced spin , agnr(22;5 ) gains a net magnetic moment of @xmath25=1 @xmath26 per cell .",

    "eventually , the semiconducting ribbon becomes metallic .",
    "not only armchair , but also zigzag nanoribbons are strongly affected by defects due to single and multiple vacancies . when coupled with the magnetic edge states of the zigzag nanoribbons the vacancy defect brings about additional changes .",

    "otherwise , @xmath25 becomes zero , when the position of the defect deviates from the center .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) the sum of the magnetic moments of the edge states is not zero , but the net magnetic moment per unit cell becomes zero only after the spins of the defect is added .",

    "[ fig:3 ] ( d)-(f ) two defects associated with two separated vacancy and a defect associated with a relaxed divacancy exhibit similar behaviors .",
    "an important issue to be addressed here is the breakdown of lieb s theorem@xcite for those zigzag ribbons . according to lieb s theorem ,",
    "the net magnetic moment per cell is determined with the difference in the number of atoms belonging to different sublattices , and it shall be either @xmath25=1 @xmath26 or 2 @xmath26 for the cases in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "none of the cases in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is in agreement with lieb s theorem . here",

    "the lowering of the total energy , a driving force for such reconstruction , is as high as 0.5 - 0.6 ev / cell .",

    "the tip ( or electrodes ) are situated at one of the position 1 - 3 .",
    "the repeat period is @xmath13=20.,width=300 ]    finally , we note that introducing periodic vacancies or defects on a given ribbon appear to be difficult with the state of the art technologies .",
    "here we propose a method as described in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] to achieve the formation of periodic local defects like holes or vacancies .",
    "the sharp electrodes like stm tips are situated at desired locations , such as one of the cases 1 - 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( a ) on the graphene with a given repeat periodicity",
    ". a potential difference , @xmath32 common to all electrodes ( tips ) is applied between the tip and underlying insulator through the graphene . this way the electronic potential of graphene atoms just below the tip",
    "is locally lowered or raised depending on the polarity of @xmath32 . here , the effect of locally and periodically applied potential difference has been modelled by etb , where the on - site energies of carbon atoms below the tip have been changed accordingly .",
    "although the present model is crude , it still allows us the realization of monitoring of the properties of nanoribbons . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( b ) the variation of @xmath22 with @xmath32 is calculated for agnr(n;20 ) with @xmath3=34 , 36 and 38 by using periodically located tips at the center of the ribbon .",

    "[ fig:1-b ] , the available parameters , such as @xmath32 , @xmath13 , tip - geometry and its position make the monitoring of the properties possible .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the energy band gaps and magnetic states of graphene nanoribbons can be modified by defects due to single or multiple vacancies . the optimized atomic structure of various vacancy defects have been found to be identical with the tem images reported earlier @xcite .",
