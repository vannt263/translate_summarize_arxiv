    "the aim of this paper is to build on previous work to achieve a controlled evaluation of the anomalous exponents that characterize various correlation and structure function in navier - stokes turbulence , and in particular the exponents @xmath0 that characterize @xmath1th order structure functions .",
    "the main result of this paper is that given a single experimental input ( for example the value of the anomalous exponent of the second order structure function ) , the @xmath1 dependence of all the other exponents that were reliably measured in experiments and simulations can be calculated analytically .",
    "decades of experimental and theoretical attention ( see for example @xcite ) have been devoted to two types of simultaneous correlation functions ; the first type includes the structure functions of velocity differences , @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for a suitably defined ensemble average .",
    "a second type of correlations include gradients of the velocity field .",
    "an important example is the rate @xmath10 at which energy is dissipated into heat due to viscous damping .",
    "this rate is roughly @xmath11 .",
    "an often - studied simultaneous correlation function of @xmath12 is @xmath13 it has been hypothesized by kolmogorov in 1941 ( k41 ) and 1962 ( k62 ) that statistical objects of this type exhibit power law dependence on @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath15 in addition , the k41 theory predicted the values of @xmath0 to be @xmath16 .",
    "experimental measurements and computer simulations show that in some aspects k41 was remarkably close to the truth . the major aspect of its predictions , that the statistical quantities depend on the length scale @xmath14 as power laws , is corroborated by experiments . on the other hand , the predicted exponents seem not to be exactly realized .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath0 deviate progressively from @xmath16 when @xmath1 increases @xcite .",
    "k62 tried to improve on this prediction by taking into account the fluctuations in the rate of energy dissipation .",
    "on the basis of a phenomenological model , assuming the distributions function of energy dissipation to be lognormal , k62 reached the predictions @xmath17 besides the fact that these predictions did not follow from fluid mechanical considerations , it was pointed out @xcite that they are violating basic inequalities that do not allow the exponents @xmath0 to decrease , something that always happens with ( [ k62 ] ) with @xmath1 large enough .",
    "the quest for computing the scaling exponents from the equations of fluid mechanics was long , arduous , and on the whole pretty unsuccessful .",
    "in this paper we present an approach that is based on our own previous findings which culminates in the analytic calculation of exponents like @xmath0 and @xmath18 . at present",
    "the calculation is not completely from first principle .",
    "we need the input of _ one _ number from experiment , say @xmath19 .",
    "given this number we can calculate all the other exponents systematically with @xmath5 being a small parameter that organizes our calculations .",
    "to first order in @xmath5 we recapture ( [ k62 ] ) .",

    "[ fig-5 ] .",
    "we show the k41 prediction , the result of our calculation to 1-loop order , and the 2-loop result that is presented in eq .",
    "( [ finalzn1 ] ) . while the _ form _ of these results is universal , the numerical value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 depends on the details of the calculations",
    "; we find that @xmath21 is always negative and of the order of unity .",
    "note that the 2-loop results correct the unwanted down curving of the 1-loop calculation ( which is the same malaise as in k62 ) .",
    "= 8.6truecm    in thinking about the strategy for this work we were led by some insights that developed in the context of understanding how to compute the scaling exponents of the kraichnan model of passive scalar advection @xcite . in that model",
    "a scalar field @xmath22 is advected by a gaussian velocity field @xmath23 which is delta - correlated in time but which has a scaling exponent @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 the advected scalar has trivial statistics , and for @xmath26 small the model has a natural small parameter .",
    "it turned out that the calculation of the exponents can proceed along two ways .",
    "the first , which is non - perturbative , was pioneered in @xcite .",
    "it considers the differential equations that the @xmath1th order correlation functions satisfy , and identifies the anomalous scaling solutions as the zero modes of these differential equations .",
    "the calculation of the exponents then depends on the calculation of the zero modes themselves , a task that is not at all easy , and therefore such calculations were never done for any order but @xmath27 . in this method",
    "the renormalization scale is the outer scale @xmath28 , not the inner scale @xmath29 , and the dimensionless ratio of scales that carries the anomalous part of the exponents of the structure functions is @xmath30 where @xmath14 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ du1 ] ) .",
    "a second method that was discussed in detail in @xcite considers instead of the correlation functions the averages of higher moments of @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 . these quantities diverge as powers of @xmath33 , and the exponents of this power are the same as the anomalous part of the exponent of the @xmath1th order structure function .",
    "the great advantage of the second method is that one can write a perturbative theory in @xmath26 for the scaling exponents themselves , _ without any need to compute the zero modes or any other functions of many variables_. thus the second method allows easily computations to @xmath34 @xcite and with some more efforts to higher orders .",
    "the insight gained is that one needs to focus on a quantity that offers the most feasible calculation , exposing the anomalous part of the exponents as it appears with a dimensionless ratio of length scales .    in navier stokes turbulence",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "on the one hand we have a non - perturbative theory which in this case is the infinite hierarchy formed by the equations of motion of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "we can use this hierarchy to demonstrate that anomalous solutions exist , but the computation of the scaling exponents requires a calculation of the correlation functions themselves .",
    "this is a very difficult task that up to now was not accomplished in a satisfactory manner .",
    "the other approach will be described in this paper .",
    "it will be a perturbative theory for the scaling exponents themselves , not requiring the computation of the correlation function along the way .",
    "similarly to the second method in the kraichnan problem it will be based on considering limits of correlation functions when @xmath35 coordinates fuse . in that limit",
    "we create , even when all the distances are in the inertial range , a ratio of large and small lengthscales that appears raised to the power of the anomalous exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the two previous findings that influence crucially the present formulation are the mechanism for anomalous scaling that was announced in ref.@xcite , and the fusion rules that were discussed in ref.@xcite . in short , ref .",
    "@xcite exposed the ladder diagrams which appear in the theory of turbulence .",
    "these diagrams contain logarithmic divergences that are summable to power laws with anomalous exponents .",
    "these ladder diagrams contain  rungs \" of the ladder , that are actually vertices with four , six and more  legs \" , representing 4-point , 6-point and higher order interaction amplitudes . in ref.@xcite",
    "these objects were represented in terms of infinite series of diagrams that could not be resummed analytically .",
    "this is where the fusion rules are now called to save the day .",
    "the fusion rules determine the asymptotic properties of @xmath1-point correlation functions when subgroups of @xmath35 coordinates coalesce together .",
    "as such the fusion rules are non - perturbative , and are believed to be exact .",
    "we use the fusion rules to determine the asymptotic properties of the rungs .",
    "this is done such that a _ calculation _ of @xmath2 from the theory will agree with the experimental value of @xmath2 .",
    "we then show that the knowledge of the asymptotics suffices for constructing a calculation of all the other scaling exponents , and in particular of @xmath0 for @xmath36 and of @xmath18 .",
    "the crux is that in the process of determining the analytic form of the rungs we discover that their amplitude contains powers of a dimensionless small parameter @xmath37 . using this small parameter in the renormalized 4-point interaction allows us to develop a systematic expansion in orders of @xmath5 . at the end of this paper",
    "we sketch a way to understand the remaining task regarding the origin of the small parameter @xmath38 .    in sect .",
    "[ s : summary ] we summarize past results that are necessary for the present developments . in sect .",
    "[ s : ladder ] we show how the fusion rules can be used to determine the properties of the rungs in the ladder diagrams appearing in the @xmath1th order correlation functions .",
    "the first important new result is demonstrated in sect .  [",
    "s : sanding ] - the numerical coefficient contained in the 4-point rung is shown to be _ small _ , of the order of the anomaly of @xmath2 .",
    "this result is crucial since it allows ( to our knowledge for the first time ) to develop a perturbative calculation of the anomalous parts of all the other exponents .",
    "the physical reason for this result is that ( in sect .",
    "[ s : k41 ] ) _ we are developing the theory around the k41 solution instead of the dissipative solution _ as was always attempted . in sect .",
    "[ s : sanding ] we pave the way for the calculation of all the other exponents . in sect .",
    "[ s : surprise ] we calculate the scaling exponents by resumming the logarithmically divergent ladder diagrams up to @xmath4 ( which is known in the field - theoretic jargon as the  1-loop order \" in the renormalized rungs ) .",
    "we find ( admittedly to our surprise ) that to this order the scaling exponents are identical to k62 . like the latter they suffer from the violation of the known requirement that @xmath0 can not decrease with @xmath1 @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ s:2loop ] we show that the 2-loop order cures the malaise of k62 , and we present the result ( [ finalzn1 ] ) for @xmath0 that in our theoretical estimate is valid for @xmath39 .",

    "[ s : discuss ] we summarize the paper , paying special attention to the range of validity of the theory and to demonstrating that no uncontrolled approximations were made .",

    "it is well known , ( and see for example paper i ) that developing a perturbative approach @xcite for the correlation functions and response functions in terms of the eulerian velocity @xmath45 results in a theory that is plagued with infra - red divergences . on the other hand one can transform to new variables , and",
    "after the transformation ( which amounts to infinite partial resummations in the perturbation theory ) one finds a renormalized perturbation theory that is finite , without any divergences in any order of the expansion ( cf.@xcite and paper i ) .",

    "@xmath80 : @xmath81 where for brevity we use the notation @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , one defines the nonlinear green s functions @xmath83 as the response of the product of @xmath35 velocity differences between @xmath35 distinct points and @xmath84 to the action of @xmath35 forces in different points .    in a gaussian theory ( which ours is not )",
    "@xmath85 would be the products of the linear green s functions like @xmath86 . in a non - gaussian theory it is natural to assume that this quantity is a homogeneous function of its arguments when they are in the scaling regime .",
    "this means that @xmath87    from the gaussian decomposition of this quantity we would guess that @xmath88 .",
    "the proof of locality in paper i means that there is no perturbative mechanism to change this scaling index . on the other hand , this quantity , which is a function of four space - time coordinates @xmath89 has scaling properties that are not exhausted by the overall scaling exponent @xmath90 .",
    "we have shown in paper ii that when we consider its dependence on _ ratios _ of space - time coordinates in their asymptotic regimes w e pick up a set of anomalous scaling exponents .",
    "the main result of paper ii was that in the regime @xmath91 the diagrammatic expansion of this object produces logarithms like ln@xmath92 to some power .",
    "it was explained that the sum of such logarithmically large contributions is given by @xmath93 with some anomalous exponent @xmath94 . to make the appearance of anomalous exponents evident we review the simplest object that resums to logarithms , _",
    "i.e. _ the series of  ladder diagrams \" .",

    "[ fig-1]a , where the notation of the diagrams is explained shortly in the figure legend and at length in appendix  [ ap - a ] .",
    "the 4-point  rungs \" appearing in the ladders were represented in paper ii as an infinite series expansion whose beginning is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b .",
    "the rest of the expansion involves exceedingly complicated diagrams that we failed to resum analytically .",
    "nevertheless , just from general properties one could show that the ladder with @xmath1 rungs contains a contribution of order @xmath95^{n}/n!$ ] .",
    "the summation of all these contributions gives a term proportional to @xmath96 , and this is the observation that we want to build on in this paper .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how the anomalous exponents of higher order correlation functions can be related to resummed ladder diagrams .",
    "the idea is to consider a typical @xmath1th order correlation function and to almost fuse @xmath35 coordinates , @xmath97 , chosen from the available @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "the point to observe is that the diagrammatic theory allows us to write , upon observation , all the topologically possible diagrams appearing in the expansion of a given object .",
    "thus for example consider fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] where we represent a general @xmath1th order correlation function , in which two coordinates are a distance @xmath98 from each other , and all the rest are a distance @xmath14 from them and from each other . while coalescing the two coordinates we pull out a contribution that reads @xmath99 connected to the rest of the diagram with @xmath100 coordinates .",
    "we know that this contribution exists since it is allowed topologically .",
    "but this fragment is represented in its turn by the sum of the ladder diagrams that we present in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "we thus state that whenever we are about to fuse two coordinates in any @xmath1th order correlation function we can expose a series of diagrams that are the same as those that appear in the expansion of the nonlinear green s function @xmath79 , together with the logarithmic divergences that are associated with them . in appendix",
    "[ ap - a ] we explain that in doing so we really take into account all the necessary contributions , leaving nothing uncontrolled .",
    "now we employ the fusion rules .",
    "these tell us that _ as a function of the two fusing coordinates _",
    "the @xmath1th order correlation function is a homogeneous function whose homogeneity exponent is @xmath2 .",
    "accordingly , if we succeed to resum the ladder diagrams in the limit @xmath77 we should find an anomalous part of @xmath2 from the dimensionless power @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we can almost fuse 3 , 4 or @xmath35 coordinates , and accordingly pull out of the diagram for the @xmath1th order correlation functions more complex ladders with 3 , 4 or @xmath35 struts .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig-2]b we show how the fusion of 3 coordinates singles out a fragment that is @xmath102 whose ladder diagrams have three struts cf .",
    "[ fig-3 ] .",
    "the fusion rules guarantee that the @xmath1th order correlation is a homogeneous function of the @xmath35 fusing coordinates with @xmath103 being the homogeneity exponent .",
    "we will show that these more complex ladders also resum into power laws in @xmath78 , being responsible for the anomalous parts of @xmath103 .",
    "at this point all this is a bit formal , since we do not have an explicit form of the rungs in the ladder diagrams , and we can compute nothing without this knowledge . in the next two sections we will address this issue and demonstrate that a judicious use of the fusion rules dictates enough knowledge of the rungs to take us through a useful calculation .",
    "in this section we reorganize the theory such that kolmogorov s 41 theory serves as its  free \" limit . in other words , we aim at achieving a theory in which resummations of divergent contributions would directly give the _ anomalous _ parts of the scaling exponents ; the k41 parts should be obvious order - by - order .",
    "this is done in two steps , that are correspondingly presented in subsects .",
    "[ ss : resum ] and [ ss : renorm ] .",
    "it was explained in subsect .",
    "[ ss : basic ] that our theory is developed in the bl - representation , to eliminate spurious ir divergences that stem from the sweeping interactions .",
    "the main result of paper i was that after line - resummation each diagram in the bl - diagrammatic expansion of the propagators ( green s function and double correlation function ) converged in the infrared and the ultraviolet regimes .",
    "accordingly , k41 scaling is a solution of the order - by - order theory .",
    "nevertheless , the propagators in the bl - representation lose translational invariance , and are therefore not diagonal in fourier space .",
    "for the purpose of actual calculations it is extremely advantageous to rearrange the theory such that the bl - propagators become again diagonal in fourier space .",
    "the actual resummation that is necessary is presented in appendix  [ k41prop ] .",
    "it results in a diagrammatic theory that is topologically exactly the same as the standard wyld diagrammatic expansion before line resummation .",
    "there are two differences as explained in the appendix  [ k41prop ] . for the purposes of our considerations below the main issue",
    "is the simple form of the the propagators that appear as lines in the diagrams : they exhibit k41 scaling exponents : @xmath104 in these formulae the scaling exponents are carried by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are dimensionless constants .      in this subsection",
    "we determine the form of the 4-point rungs of the ladder diagrams in two steps .",
    "these two steps are based on the following observation : the diagrammatic expansion of the rung includes many diagrams , some of which contain in them additional subsets of ladder diagrams . in the first step we will consider the rungs as if all the diagrams appearing in their infinite series were resummed , _ except _ for their own internal subsets of ladder diagrams . in the second step we will consider also the ladder diagrams appearing in the series for the rung .",
    "we aim to a situation in which all the ladders that appear in the theory , like in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , contain already renormalized rungs . however , instead of evaluating the rungs from actual resummations we are going to determine their form using the fusion rules .",
    "thus in the first step we find the form of the rung that results , upon fusion , in k41 scaling exponents . in the second step we recognize that the rungs themselves have ladders , leading to an anomalous correction in the scaling properties of the rungs themselves .",
    "this being accomplished , we will have our final form of the rung .",
    "then we turn to the ladder diagrams appearing in the fused correlation functions , using the rung as a basic building block of the theory .",
    "all anomalies of all the measurable statistical objects will result from resummations of the remaining ladder diagrams .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a , in which the rung appears as an object .",
    "it is given in terms of an infinite series of diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b .",
    "it is in fact a 4-point vertex depending on four @xmath108-vectors and four frequencies . as a first step we consider the value of the rung when all the frequencies are zero , denoting it in this limit as @xmath109 . at a later point",
    "we will explain that this is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the bare value of this object can be read directly from diagram ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b , with two bare bl - vertices @xmath110 and one double correlation function .",
    "the answer is @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "we demonstrate now that if we use this bare form of the rung the fusion rules would predict _ dissipative _ exponents , @xmath114 .",
    "we first demonstrate this in the context of @xmath2 .",
    "consider a general @xmath1 order correlation function as in fig .",
    "[ fig-2]a , and fuse two coordinates , pulling out the fragment of @xmath85 as shown on the rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig-2]a .",
    "we will now compute the scaling exponent by finding the @xmath98 dependence of this fragment when the two coordinates approach each other to a _ small _ distance @xmath77 where @xmath14 is the typical distance between all the other coordinates . to find the @xmath98 dependence we must integrate according to the explanation in appendix  [ ap - self ] , and to this aim we introduce the object @xmath115 : @xmath116 we are interested in the @xmath98 dependence of this object in the limit @xmath117 . to calculate @xmath115 in this limit we return to fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a .",
    "obviously the gaussian contribution diagram ( 1 ) is irrelevant in this limit .",
    "the skeleton diagram ( 2 ) contributes the following integral : @xmath118 where the tensor indices of the rung were contracted for the longitudinal contribution .",

    "we conclude that the 2-loop contribution is very significant for experimentally measured exponents .",
    "if one wishes to obtain theoretical results for @xmath103 with higher values of @xmath35 one needs to consider the 3-loop contributions , which pose no further conceptual difficulties .",
    "nevertheless the experimental situation does not warrant at the present time the effort needed to accomplish such a calculation .",
    "one should stress before closing this section that the form of eq .",
    "( [ finalzn ] ) is universal , stemming from the structure of the ladder diagrams and from combinatorics only .",
    "however the numerical value of @xmath21 is model dependent .",
    "we have checked that changing the form of the rung keeping the asymptotics unchanged results in @xmath21 remaining negative while its value not changing by more than a factor of 2 or so . at this moment in time",

    "the main steps of this and previous papers leading to the present results have been as follows :    * the theory is developed using bl - velocities to eliminate the spurious infrared divergences that are due to sweeping effects when eulerian velocities are employed . * the dyson - wyld perturbation theory was line resummed in order to achieve order by order convergent perturbation theory with k41 propagators as the lines in the theory . at this point",
    "the objects of the theory are two 2-point propagators ( green s function and correlator ) and one 3-point vertex .",
    "the 3-point vertex is in no way  small \" , and renormalizing it does not change this fact @xcite . *",
    "multipoint correlation functions are considered when @xmath35 coordinates coalesce together . in the fusion limit @xmath275 it is advantageous to reorganize the theory in terms of one propagator ( k41 green s function ) , and 4-point , 6-point vertices etc .",
    "( the rungs ) . the series of diagrams contributing to the fusion limit are then simple ladder diagrams . *",
    "the crucial step of the theory is achieved by two requirements : ( i ) the 4-point rung should be consistent at the level of the _ skeleton diagrams _ with the fusion rules with k41 scaling exponents .",
    "( ii ) the resummation of the ladder diagrams that appear when 2 coordinates fuse together should lead to the _ correct _ value of @xmath2 .",
    "these double requirements accomplish two things in one go :",
    "( i ) the theory is now developed _ around the k41 limit _ , leading to the appearance of the small parameter @xmath5 in front of the 4-point rung , and ( ii ) all the anomalies are coming from the ladder resummations . the 6-point rung is shown explicitly ( appendix  [ 6rung ] ) to be of second order in the small parameter , 8-point rungs are of third order , etc . *",
    "we computed the anomalous exponents in 1-loop order , inputting the value of @xmath2 and requiring that @xmath175 .",
    "the result is that the scaling exponents are predicted to this order to agree with the log normal model k62 .",
    "we showed that to this order the result is universal , independent of the simplifications and of the model form of the rung .",
    "* we computed the anomalous exponents in 2-loop order .",
    "the malaise of k62 is cured , the 2-loop contribution has a sign that lifts up the exponents from the down curve of the k62 parabola .",
    "while the form of the 2-loop result is universal , the numerical value of the parameter @xmath21 appearing in the final result is model dependent , with contributions for the 4-point and 6-point rungs .",
    "to improve upon the present theory one needs to develop a theory for the 4-point and 6-point interaction amplitudes .",
    "here we determined only the asymptotic properties of the 4-point rung , and this allowed us to predict the form of the scaling exponents , but an input of the value of the anomalous part of @xmath2 was needed to nail the 1-loop order . in fact we could use the value of @xmath274 to fix the value of @xmath21 and gain a solid prediction of all the exponents to 2-loop order .",
    "such a prediction for @xmath0 would be valid up to @xmath276 .",
    "it is very easy to generalize the result that we have to 3-loop order , with the introduction of yet one more parameter associated with the 3-loop integrals , say @xmath277 , which included also contributions from the irreducible 8-point rung .",

    "we can now use the value of @xmath279 to fix @xmath277 to provide a prediction that is valid for any @xmath1 within experimental reach for quite some time .",
    "but this is not the main point .",
    "the main point is that we have identified the coefficients appearing in this formula with particular objects , i.e the 4-point and higher order vertices which appear in the theory as the rungs of the ladders . obviously",
    ", a calculation of the renormalized rungs from first principle would remove the need to input experimental information altogether , affording us a complete theory of the scaling exponents of isotropic turbulence . at this point",
    "this is still not in the cards .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank anna pomyalov for her patient help with the diagrams in this paper .",
    "we thank her , yoram cohen , ayse erzan and massimo vergassola for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the israel science foundation , the german - isreali foundation , the european commission under contract hprn - ct-2000 - 00162 (  nonideal turbulence \" ) , and the naftali and anna backenroth - bronicki fund for research in chaos and complexity .",
    "it is important to stress that in the present theory we take into account all the necessary contributions .",
    "to understand this we need to say a few more words about the representation of @xmath99 in terms of simple ladders only , and of the @xmath1th order correlation function with @xmath35 fused coordinates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "the natural objects in the straightforward perturbation theory are the 2-point correlation function and green s function ( [ b6 ] ) , and the 3-point vertex resulting from the navier - stokes nonlinearity @xmath280 .",
    "after line resummation the theory contains  dressed \" correlator and green s function .",
    "the 3-point vertex is protected by galilean invariance and is not effected much by dressing @xcite .",
    "thus , when we write the expansion of @xmath99 many diagrams involving these objects appear . the strategy that leads to the simple ladder expansion of fig .  [ fig-1 ] is as follows : every diagram that contributes to the series is inspected for its cross section , or in other words what are the kind of objects that intersect a line cutting across the diagram .",
    "the line is put at the left of the diagram , and is moved to the right . every time that the line intersects two green s functions that are oriented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] we mark that position , and move the line further to the right , until we intersect again two green s functions , etc . for every pair of such intersections we now sum up all the topologically allowed diagrams that can be inflated ad infinitum from the fragments appearing between the two pairs of green s functions .",
    "this infinite resummation is the representation of the rung , which is actually a 4-point vertex .",
    "this procedure is flawless , taking into account all the possible diagram in the series of @xmath99 _ except _ for one subseries .",
    "this is the subseries of diagrams in which the cross section contains exactly two 2-point correlation functions .",
    "it was shown in paper ii that this can happen only _ once per diagram _ , and therefore we can not resum such contributions to the rung , since this will lead to one rung differing from all the others .",
    "thus the series shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a contains in the @xmath281 also ladders in which the struts contain two correlators above each other . with these",
    "we account for all the possible diagrams in @xmath99 .",
    "= 8.6truecm 0.3 cm    the presence of these diagrams also complicates the discussion of the fusion rules and fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] . when we pool out the fragment containing the two coalescing coordinates we will generate in the series expansion of this fragment also the diagrams containing two correlators in the cross section .",
    "to understand their roles we will always consider the fragment of the diagrams to the right of this special cross section as belonging to the main body , see fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] .",
    "but now the fragment pulled out becomes a 4th order correlation function instead of @xmath99 .",
    "one can analyze the role of this diagram in the fusion limit , and the conclusion is that when @xmath77 it contributes the same power @xmath282 as the diagrams considered in the body of the paper .",
    "we thus conclude that the procedure followed in the body of the paper is amply sufficient for the calculation of @xmath2 .",
    "the same type of considerations apply when we fuse @xmath35 coordinates . in the series expansion for @xmath283 we will have however ladder diagrams whose topology requires resummation into 2@xmath35-point irreducible interaction amplitudes which serve as new types of rungs .",
    "the first one appears at the level of @xmath102 , and is the 6-point rung that is discussed explicitly in appendix  [ 6rung ] .",
    "it will be argued that the 6-point rung is of second order in the smallness @xmath5 that characterizes the 4-point rung . respectively",
    "the 2@xmath35-point rungs are of @xmath284 and thus rungs with @xmath285 will not affect the analysis of this paper .    on top of the diagrams considered in the body of the paper one needs to consider those having @xmath35 correlators in the cross section .",
    "the conclusion is however the same - the diagrams considered give all the necessary information , no new ( or more divergent ) information is available in the diagrams that we do not consider explicitly .    at the end of the day the procedure of calculating the scaling exponents to @xmath251 leaves us with only _ three _ dressed objects in the theory , the dressed 2-point greens function and new 4-point and 6-point dressed vertices which we call the rungs .",
    "we will show that the rungs are _ small _ and therefore these three objects suffice for a consistent and controlled theory of the scaling exponents .",
    "a reader who is an expert in diagrammatic theories may feel worried that the procedure advocated here mixes into the 4-point vertex some 2-particle reducible diagrams .",
    "this is indeed so .",
    "in other words ( and see paper iii for more details ) there are contributions in which the cross section includes two propagators , like one green s function and one correlator , or two green s functions oriented oppositely to the ones plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] , which we resum into our 4-point vertex . usually one would prefer not to include 2-particle reducible diagrams in the 4-point vertex , but rather to distinguish different 4-point vertices .",
    "in our case one would need three different 4-point rungs , all presented in detail in paper iii .",
    "indeed , if we planned to compute our 4-point vertices from summing up diagrams it would be very advisable to distinguish different types of rungs . in this paper",
    "we determine however the properties of the 4-point vertex from the fusion rules , and it makes no difference at all how we classify the diagrams . for the sake of clear presentation",
    "it is much better to have just one type of rung .",
    "this rung is 2-particle reducible and hides three types of 2-particle irreducible rungs as a single object .",
    "the conclusions of the analysis are independent of this simplification .",
    "the starting point of this rearrangement are the mass operators in @xmath286 representation @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    " diagonal \" part of the mass operators as @xmath289 in these definitions @xmath84 disappears .",
    "the reason is that for objects which are time independent the eulerian and bl - representations are equivalent and the designation @xmath84 is unneeded .",
