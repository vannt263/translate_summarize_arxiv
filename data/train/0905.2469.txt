    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite has provided the astronomical community with a wealth of information on sources with circumstellar disks , both previously known and recently discovered .",
    "the importance of having a more complete statistical sample of sources that have disks is tied in closely with our knowledge of the timescales for planet formation .",
    "for example , knowing when the inner region of the primordial or protoplanetary disk begins to clear itself of dust constrains the lower end of this timescale .",
    "several ground - based observational near - infrared studies give evidence pointing to the clearing of the inner disk by 3 to 5myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet the current paradigm is that planet formation occurs on timescales of 10myr or longer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the primordial disk is essentially an accretion disk ( formed as the parental molecular cloud collapsed into a star ) that is still feeding the newly formed star with material .",
    "mainly , magnetospheric accretion is responsible for the clearing of most of the gas and dust in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , planet formation also helps with the clearing of the gaseous protoplanetary disk by the the formation of planetesimals that sweep up much of the disk s material .",
    "the formation of larger planetary bodies occurs via collisions of smaller planetesimals ( lunar - mass oligarchs , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and this process generates a secondary dusty disk , mostly devoid of gas , known as a debris disk , i.e. , the debris disk consists mainly of dust that is produced in the collisions between the newly formed planetesimals .",
    "since there need to be colliding planetesimals present to replenish the dust in the disk , detecting a debris disk is a strong signature of an emerging planetary system .    to constrain the duration of the primordial accretion disk phase and the transition from primordial to debris disks it is necessary to analyze stars of intermediate age ( between 20 and 40myr ) .",
    "the ngc2547 stellar cluster presents itself as an ideal candidate to study the evolution of circumstellar disks because of its relatively close distance , 361@xmath3pc , and age 38.5@xmath4myr @xcite . to investigate the disk population of this cluster",
    ", @xcite acquired _ spitzer _ data ( program i d 58 , p.i .",
    "george rieke ) of the cluster ngc2547 , consisting of imaging in all four infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite bands and all three multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) @xcite bands .",
    "the preliminary results were reported in @xcite , where they found that a very small fraction ( @xmath05% ) of cluster members show evidence for levels of infrared excess emission likely due to primordial disks .",
    "the other significant result from @xcite was the discovery of a candidate late - type star ( 2mass08093547 - 4913033 ) that has a considerable 24@xmath5 m excess .",
    "it presents no detectable excess emission shortward of 8 , while the 24 um excess is reduced compared to ctts , suggesting it may possess a debris disk with an inner hole .",
    "this star is of interest because of the rarity of observations of debris disks around late - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially for ngc2547 s age .",
    "observing a large excess emission , such as that detected towards this particular star , could be indicative of recent planet formation .",
    "numerical calculations carried out by @xcite showed that formation of planetary bodies that are 1000 km in size or larger produces copious amounts of dust , creating greater scattering of light from the central star and producing excess emission .",
    "the aforementioned irac and mips data were re - analyzed and recently published by @xcite ; from their membership list they found that @xmath61% of sources show irac excesses , while 30 - 45% of b - f members present 24  excess emission .",
    "@xcite also discovered an additional m dwarf with excess emission indicative of the presence of a debris disk .",
    "to better probe the fraction of debris disks among lower mass stars @xcite acquired an extremely deep mips dataset ( program i d 21127 , p.i .",
    "charles j. lada ) and discovered nine additional candidate m - dwarf debris disks . although m - type stars are the most numerous of any type , their debris disk statistics are extremely scarce due to their faintness . acquiring more observations of debris disks around m stars",
    "is therfore very important to improve our understanding of how these disks evolve and planet formation occurs .    in this paper",
    "we report our findings regarding the debris disk around the aforementioned member of ngc2547 , 2mass 08093547 - 4913033 , found by @xcite to possess considerable excess emission at 24 .",
    "this source will be referred to henceforth as source # 23 , following @xcite s nomenclature . to determine the source s spectral type , we acquired optical spectroscopy .",
    "we obtained _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) observations to study this source in more detail , in particular , to determine whether the disk has silicate emission and to help constrain its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling .",
    "the shape of silicate features gives insight into dust grain size and possibly also its crystallinity if the signal - to - noise ratio is high enough .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows :  [ sec : obs ] summarizes the acquisition and reduction of the optical and irs spectroscopic data , and ",
    "[ sec : res ] presents the results obtained .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  [ sec : dis ] , and finally , we list our conclusions in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the spectroscopic data of source # 23 was acquired on the 19th of june of 2006 ( irs campaign 32 ) , through go proposal program id20750 ( p.i . charles j. lada ) .",
    "the data are comprised of low resolution ( r@xmath060 - 127 ) observations taken using the _ spitzer _ irs @xcite short - low ( sl ) module , with a total on - source integration time of 3.2 hours .",
    "we built four astronomical observation requests ( aors ) , each with 2 cycles of 240s of ramp duration for the second order of sl ( sl2 : 5.2 - 8.7 ) and 10 cycles of 240s of ramp duration for the first order of sl ( sl1 : 7.4 - 14.5 ) ; the aor keys are 15096064 , 15096320 , 15096570 , and 15096832 .",
    "we used a pointing control reference sensors ( pcrs ) peak - up target located at ( @xmath7)(j2000)=(080959.22 , -491611.0 ) , with m@xmath8 magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : aor ] shows the orientation of the aors with respect to the background in ngc2547 during the observations .",
    "+ we used the cube builder for irs spectra maps ( cubism ) software @xcite to reduce and extract the spectrum of the source from the four aors , for each order .",
    "the reduction began with the subtraction of the off nod position slit from the on - source position slit for each order ; this step was meant to ( i ) eliminate instrumental effects such as leftover background gradients from the pipeline flat - fielding , ( ii ) subtract out the zodiacal emission , and ( iii ) remove rogue pixels ( created mostly by cosmic rays ) .",
    "additional bad pixels were identified and removed .",
    "three spectra were extracted for each order , namely , on - source spectrum , and two local background spectra on either side of the source .",
    "the smart software @xcite was then used to merge the first and second orders , to construct an averaged local background spectrum , and also used to build the final on - source spectrum with local background subtraction .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the average local background used ( gray ) and on - source spectrum with and without local background subtraction .",
    "broad polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) bands are present as absorption features in the averaged local background spectrum and on - source with no local background subtraction spectrum - these are in fact emission bands present in the off - nod observations ( figure [ fig : aor ] shows faint diffuse emission in the off - nod slits ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the off - nod observations were subtracted from the on - nod observations , turning the pah emission bands into `` absorption '' bands .",
    "the local background subtraction adds back in the pah flux removed by the on - off slit subtraction ( see figure [ fig : spectra ] ) . from 7.5  to 14.8  the spectrum has a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 33 , and from 5.2  to 7.5  the snr is 22 .      through spitzer imaging of ngc2547",
    ", @xcite detected excess emission at 24  from the candidate low - mass star # 23 .",
    "we have used an optical spectrum of this source to measure its spectral type and to constrain the presence of accretion through the strength of the h@xmath9 emission line .",
    "the spectrum was obtained on 2004 april 26 during multi - slit spectroscopic observations of candidate members of ngc2547 using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the magellani telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the spectrograph was operated with the 600  lmm@xmath10 grism , og570 blocking filter , and slit widths of @xmath11 , which produced a spectral resolution of 2.0   .",
    "the exposure time was 60s .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectrum of the source was extracted and calibrated in wavelength with arc lamp data .",
    "we corrected for the sensitivity functions of the detectors through observations of a spectrophotometric standard star .",
    "the optical spectrum of the star # 23 is presented in figure[fig : optical_spectra ] .",
    "through a comparison to standard field dwarfs , we have measured a spectral type of m4.5 and an equivalent width @xmath12    for h@xmath9 from the optical spectrum .",
    "the spectral type we determine agrees with that obtained by @xcite .    the on - source , local background subtracted , irs spectrum of figure [ fig : spectra ] was combined with existing multiband wavelength photometry , from the optical to mips 24  @xcite to build an sed , shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the final spectrum shows silicate emission , however the variable background and the faintness of the source makes it very difficult to draw strong conclusions about the shape of this feature .",
    "we model the sed using monte carlo radiation transfer codes developed for modeling and interpreting spectra and images of dusty accretion disks and envelopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the codes ) .",
    "the codes include multiple anisotropic scattering and use the @xcite algorithm for computing radiative equilibrium dust temperatures and thermal spectra .",
    "the presence of a silicate feature in the sed indicates that the disk contains small grains @xcite , so we adopt the @xcite interstellar medium ( ism ) dust model for the opacity and scattering properties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a graphical representation of the wavelength dependence of this model ) .",
    "the grain size distribution of @xcite model follows a power law ( slope @xmath0 -3 ) between 0.02  and 0.2 , and then falls off exponentially .    for the object under study",
    "we adopt an axisymmetric flared disk density structure and assume the disk is heated by starlight .",
    "the density structure is parameterized by @xmath13 } \\left({r\\over{r}}\\right)^{\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath15 is the vertical scale , @xmath9 is the radial density exponent , and @xmath16 is the normalization constant .",
    "the disk scale - height is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath2 is the disk scale - height at a radius of 100au and @xmath18 is the flaring power .",
    "the disk extends from an inner radius , @xmath19 to an outer radius @xmath20 .",
    "the lack of longer wavelength data makes it difficult to constrain disk parameters , so we fix some parameters based on previous models of irradiated disks .",
    "we adopt a surface density of the form @xmath21 which is typical of models of irradiated disks and fix @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sed is not very sensitive to the disk outer radius ( e.g. , see models in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we set @xmath24au .    for the central star we use a temperature of @xmath25 , a radius of @xmath26 = 0.47@xmath27 ,",
    "a luminosity of @xmath28 , and the spectrum is for a 3000k nextgen model atmosphere @xcite . with these star , disk , and dust parameters fixed",
    ", we constructed a small grid of sed models varying @xmath19 , @xmath2 and total dust disk mass , @xmath29 .",
    "the sed is somewhat degenerate in @xmath2 and @xmath29 and we find a good model fit using @xmath30au , @xmath31 , and disk luminosity of @xmath32 .",
    "the degeneracies in these models may be broken with longer wavelength data which is sensitive to the disk mass .",
    "we see that the silicate feature is fit rather well using the adopted ism grain model .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility that grain growth has occurred in the disk and the silicate feature is produced by a population of small grains in the upper disk layers with larger grains settled towards the midplane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit model is shown in figure [ fig : sed ] and the corresponding parameters are summarized in table [ tab : sed ] .",
    "what we can say from the modeling is that the disk is considerably lower mass and flatter than t  tauri disks .",
    "our models also indicate that if there is an inner disk hole it is not very large , @xmath33au , smaller than that found in other debris disks , e.g. au mic , typically many au .",
    "however , the nominal model suggests that the hole is larger than the dust sublimation radius .",
    "although the results derived from sed modeling described above are consistent with a homologously evolved protoplanetary disk @xcite , the disk appears to be devoid of gas and non - accreting : the equivalent width of the h@xmath9 emission line is 17 , which for the spectral type in question could originate in the stellar chromosphere @xcite .    to better ascertain the nature of this disk , we first consider the relevant timescales for debris disk clearing and apply them for our source .",
    "there are four possible mechanisms for the removal of dust grains from within a debris disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( i ) sublimation , ( ii ) stellar radiation pressure , ( iii ) stellar wind , and ( iv ) poynting - roberston drag .",
    "the sublimation temperatures for dust grains depend on their composition : amorphous carbon grains sublimate at 2000k , whereas silicate grains sublimate at 1500k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these temperatures are only reached at very close proximity to the star . ]",
    "; sublimation may be an important factor in the production of the very innermost regions of a hole , but it is not a relevant grain removal mechanism for the debris disk being discussed .",
    "the radiation pressure is also an insignificant grain removal mechanism for debris disks around m mass stars ( we refer the reader to * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion on this matter ) . regarding stellar wind drag , @xcite propose it may be a dominant grain removal process , but only for very young and active m dwarfs with extremely high mass loss rates ( @xmath010@xmath34 times higher than solar or 10@xmath35yr@xmath10 ) , which is not the case for source # 23 . using the mass and radius of table [ tab : sed ] we calculated the escape velocity for this source to be 299kms@xmath10",
    ". a gaussian fit to the h@xmath9 emission line profile gives a full with at half maximum of 114kms@xmath10 , so it seems winds are not very energetic for this source .",
    "the p - r drag timescale , i.e. , the time is takes for a dust grain to spiral inwards into the star , is given by @xcite :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the radius and density of the dust grain , respectively , and @xmath39 is the speed of light in the vacuum .    _",
    "spitzer _ irs spectra of the deep impact ejecta of comet 9p / temple1 revealed a dust mixture composed of amorphous and crystalline silicates , amorphous carbon , water ice , and other components , with a mean density of the dust grains for this composition of 2.96g@xmath40 @xcite , respectively . ] .",
    "a similar dust composition was found in the debris disk of hd113766a by @xcite , who observed the source using 5 - 35@xmath5 m _ spitzer _ irs data .",
    "we assume the dust in the debris disk of source # 23 is similar in composition to that of hd113766a or comet 9p / temple1 and we henceforth use the same grain density for our calculations .",
    "equation [ eq : pr1 ] is then re - written solely as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath14 :    @xmath41    a 0.2-sized dust grain at 1au would then take 2.4@xmath4210@xmath43 years to spiral onto our source .",
    "on the other hand , a 0.2-sized grain located at 41au would take @xmath040myr to spiral onto the star , so small grains located beyond this radius could be leftover material from the primordial accretion disk if no other dust removal or reprocessing mechanism is at play .",
    "yet there is one more important physical process to be considered : grain - grain collisions .",
    "these collisions either shatter the dust grains into smaller particles ( high collision velocities ) , or help clear the disk by triggering grain growth through agglomeration ( low collision velocities ) ; grain - grain collisions therefore re - distribute the grain size population .",
    "grain - grain collisions will also act to reduce the vertical scale height of the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fit sed model for our source does indeed predict a `` razor - thin '' or very flat disk , with a scale height of 2au at 100au ( see  [ sec : res ] , table [ tab : sed ] ) .",
    "the grain - grain collision timescale , @xmath44 , is given by @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the orbital period and @xmath47 is the dimensionless fractional surface density ; the latter can be approximated by @xmath48 @xcite and equation [ eq : tcol_0 ] is written as :    @xmath49    where @xmath14 is the distance of the grain from the star and @xmath50 is the stellar mass . combining equations [ eq : pr2 ] and [ eq : tcol ] , using the disk luminosity and stellar mass cited in table [ tab : sed ] , and a grain size of 0.2 , one finds that the collisional timescale is shorter than the p - r drag timescale for a disk radius greater than 2.0@xmath4210@xmath51au . in other words ,",
    "the disk is everywhere collisionally dominated .",
    "this implies that the disk is not a remnant protoplanetary disk but a bona fide debris disk since the dust grains have been reprocessed and are `` second - generation '' .    for disks with lower relative luminosities ,",
    "the inner regions may be dominated by p - r drag , however , the outer regions are always collision - dominated .",
    "for example , a disk with @xmath52 with average grain sizes of 0.2 , would have an inner hole of ( at least ) 0.2au radius because in that inner region the p - r drag timescale is shorter than the grain - grain collision timescale , i.e. , the dust grains would spiral in towards the star at a faster rate compared to the rate at which they are produced by grain - grain collisions .    to date",
    ", there are fifteen known debris disks around m stars , namely , aumic ( gj803 , hd197481 ) , m0.5 ve gj182 , m1 twa7 , m0.5 gj842.2 , and eleven sources in ngc2547 @xcite .",
    "aumic is known to have an inner hole of 17au and @xcite .",
    "equations [ eq : pr2 ] and [ eq : tcol ] could be used to explain an inner hole of @xmath00.5au if the grain sizes were 0.01 , so in au mic s particular system another mechanism may be clearing the dust ( such as substellar or planetary companion , or stellar wind drag , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "regarding disk sizes , @xcite determined a radius of 300au for gj842.2 and aumic s disk has a radius of 210au .",
    "finally , there is a wide spread in the ages for these sources , from 200myr ( gj842.2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to 12myr ( aumic * ? ? ?",
    "although the disk around source # 23 has an order of magnitude higher fractional luminosity than these other debris disks , it appears to be produced by a comparable amount of dust .",
    "the disk scale height we determined from the sed modeling of the debris disk , 2au at 100au , is similar to aumic disk s scale height , 2.5au .",
    "these scale heights are much smaller than those of ttauri protoplanetary disks . for comparison , @xcite modeled the sed of the t tauri star hh30irs , using the same monte carlo radiation transfer code as used in the work presented in this paper , and found that the disk scale height was 17au at a disk radius of 100au radius .",
    "another t tauri star whose sed was modeled using the same aforementioned code is gmaurigae , that was found to have a scale height of 8au at 100au radius .      as mentioned above in ",

    "unfortunately , due to the pah contamination and the faintness of the source , we can not draw any conclusions regarding silicate crystallization .",
    "although we can not draw more quantitative conclusions from our irs observations , to our knowledge these observations correspond to the _ first silicate emission detection from a debris disk around and m - type star_.    to estimate the temperature of silicate grains we assume their temperature is that of a blackbody with an sed peaking at 10 , i.e. , 290k .",
    "the temperature profile obtained from the sed modeling (  [ sec : res ] ) indicates that the disk reaches that temperature at a radius of @xmath00.15au ( although the silicate emission could also be arising from the upper layers of the disk ) .",

    "source # 23 is the one that presents the biggest excess emission at 24  @xcite .",
    "such a large excess , indicative of a relatively luminous disk , may be the result of a stochastic collision of planetary bodies within the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that triggered a collisional cascade @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , no longer wavelength data is available and we are unable to further constrain the grain sizes used in our model .",

    "[ subsec : timescales ] we showed that the grain - grain collisional timescale for the system is shorter than the p - r drag timescales , and consequently many small grains , possibly submicron - sized , are produced and remain in the disk .",

    "we confirm excess emission longwards of 8  for the system and report the first detection of silicate emission from a debris disk around an m - type star ; 2 .",
    "the silicate emission indicates that the dust grains seem to be small : micron or submicron - sized ; 3 .",
    "sed modeling describes the debris disk as being very flat ( scale height of 2au at 100au radius ) , and as having a mass of @xmath0 2.7 lunar assuming a disk radius of 300au .",
    "the sed model suggests that the disk extends to within 0.13au of the stellar surface , outside the dust sublimation radius .",
    "comparison of the various timescales involved in removing and producing dust leads us to conclude that the disk is dominated by grain - grain collisions throughout its entire extent ; 5 .",
    "a stochastic collision of planetary bodies could be responsible for the higher disk luminosity of this source , and formation of terrestrial planets within the habitable zone is entirely possible for this system .",
    "we confirm the spectral type of m4.5 for the source and find that its h@xmath9 emission is consistent with chromospheric activity ; the h@xmath9 emission line is also narrow enough to rule out strong stellar winds .",

    "<S> we present 5 to 15  _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) low resolution spectral data of a candidate debris disk around an m4.5 star identified as a likely member of the @xmath040myr old cluster ngc2547 . </S>",
    "<S> the irs spectrum shows a silicate emission feature , indicating the presence of warm , small , ( sub)micron - sized dust grains in the disk . of the fifteen previously known candidate debris disks around m - type stars , </S>",
    "<S> the one we discuss in this paper is the first to have an observed mid - infrared spectrum and is also the first to have measured silicate emission . </S>",
    "<S> we combined the irs data with ancillary data ( optical , @xmath1 , and _ spitzer _ infrared array camera and 24  data ) to build the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo radiation transfer modeling of the sed characterized the dust disk as being very flat ( @xmath2=2au ) and extending inward within at least 0.13au of the central star . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the disk is collisionally dominated and is likely a debris disk . </S>"
