    "micro- and nano - opto mechanical systems are the heart of refined force - sensing devices @xcite .",
    "such systems exploit the huge susceptibility around the resonance of oscillators with excellent mechanical quality factor @xmath2 , combined with high sensitivity interferometric measurements .",
    "the latter are particularly efficient when the oscillator is embedded in an optical resonator with high optical quality factor , whose optical path depends on the oscillator coordinate .",
    "this kind of devices is useful both for practical applications , and in quantum optics experiments . in both cases ,",
    "a frequent crucial task is detecting a weak variation of the external force ( that we call signal force ) on a strong background .",
    "for instance , in a quantum experiment , the signal can be due to quantum fluctuations in the radiation pressure , that are usually overwhelmed by background thermal noise ( a significant exception is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , that presents the first observation of the effect of radiation pressure shot noise on a macroscopic object ) .    due to the narrow width of the resonance and ,",
    "consequently , of the useful sensitive band with respect to typical input force , it is meaningful to discuss the general problem of detecting a weak signal force with flat spectral density ( white spectrum ) in the presence of a white background force , taking into account a given sensitivity to the oscillator displacement ( i.e. , a flat readout noise spectrum ) .",
    "this can be performed na@xmath0vely by measuring the area of the resonance peak emerging from the displacement noise spectrum ( or , equivalently , measuring the variance of the oscillator position after band - pass filtering around the resonance ) . with this estimator ,",
    "the rate of improvement of the statistical uncertainty for increasing measurement time @xmath3 depends on the correlation time @xmath4 of the oscillator motion , with a relative uncertainty scaling as @xmath5 .",
    "it seems therefore useful to decrease @xmath4 , i.e. , enhance the damping of the oscillator .",
    "however , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that such operation would increase the spectral density of thermal noise .",
    "improved results can instead be achieved by means of a cold damping , e.g. the optical cooling @xcite , that modifies the effective susceptibility and decreases the correlation time without introducing additional noise sources .",
    "this technique does not increase the signal - to - noise ratio of input excitations , because it changes the response to both signal and background force in the same way .",
    "however , as long as the cold damped peak still emerges from the displacement spectral noise , it allows a faster accumulation of statistically independent data bringing therefore , in a given measurement time , to a smaller final uncertainty in the variance of the oscillator motion .",
    "an important remark is that the correlation time of the signal force is by hypothesis very short , therefore the statistics can in principle be much faster than what allowed by the oscillator motion .",
    "in other words , the variance of the displacement is not a very efficient indicator , and more refined data analysis can be profitable . in the case of stationary , white input",
    "the optimal approach to the measurement is provided by the wiener - kolmogorov filtering theory @xcite .",
    "this technique requires the preliminary knowledge of the exact response function to the input force , and of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "while the second requirement can be relaxed with a sub - optimal but robust filter using a conservative estimate of the sensitivity @xcite , the accurate knowledge of the susceptibility is a crucial request .",
    "such knowledge is not trivial for micro opto - mechanical systems , where the stability of the resonance is affected by several detrimental effects , e.g. , thermal phenomena and relaxations of the mechanical oscillator , and above all by the same interaction with the radiation , both due to photothermal effect and to the opto - mechanical coupling .",
    "these considerations suggest that the direct measurement of the spectral peak area could be the only applicable strategy in several kinds of opto - mechanical systems , and techniques that reduce the effective coherence time of the oscillator motion , such as cold damping or feedback , represent therefore a way to effectively improve the measurement capabilities of the system @xcite .",
    "however , it has been remarked that optimal resolution is not really improved in this way @xcite , and that appropriate data filtering can completely replace these hardware techniques even in the case of non - stationary , non - gaussian input @xcite . in spite of these correct remarks ,",
    "the problem of the instability in the oscillator parameters and dynamics remains practically difficult to face , and the implementation of optimal analysis requires sophisticated technique of adaptive filtering .",
    "the experimental demonstration in ref .",
    "@xcite keeps indeed short ( @xmath6ms ) measurement times .",
    "therefore , even when willing to apply an efficient data analysis , as well as in several kinds of refined opto - mechanics experiments , stabilization and feedback techniques acting on the opto - mechanical system are crucial , and indeed this issue has been recently considered by few groups@xcite .    in this work we present a micro opto - mechanical system that includes a parametric stabilization of the resonance by controlling the optical spring .",
    "we have proposed and demonstrated this technique in a recent work @xcite , where the control allows to prevent instability in a parametrically modulated opto - mechanical system , thus yielding strong mechanical squeezing .",
    "here we study the characteristics of our system as detector of stochastic force for short measurement times ( for quick , high resolution monitoring ) as well as for long @xmath3 , thus optimizing the sensitivity .",
    "we show that , thanks to the stabilization of the effective susceptibility , we can more efficiently implement wiener filtering and investigate how this strategy improves the performance of our system .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the theoretical models for the opto - mechanical interaction , the parametric control of the oscillator , and the strategies exploitable to measure the stochastic force acting on the oscillator ; in section ii we describe our experimental setup and the measurements ; after the conclusions , in the appendix we derive the theoretical expressions for the relative uncertainty and discuss the effect of a cutoff in the measured spectra .",
    "in this section we recall some basic features of the opto - mechanical interaction .",
    "we consider an optical cavity where the resonance frequency depends on an effective coordinate @xmath7 , that is kept at its rest position @xmath8 by elastic forces .",
    "the system can be sketched as a linear cavity with a rigid oscillating mirror ( fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) having position @xmath7 , mass @xmath9 , resonance angular frequency @xmath10 , damping rate @xmath11 and susceptibility @xmath12 . the radiation pressure provides a force acting on the mirror , that depends on the detuning @xmath13 between the input radiation at frequency @xmath14 and the cavity resonance at @xmath15 .",
    "since the latter depends on @xmath7 , radiation pressure gives a position - dependent force that can be accounted for by defining an effective susceptibility .",
    "its expression is given by@xcite @xmath16   \\label{chieff}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is cavity decay rate and @xmath18 is the opto - mechanical coupling , proportional to the intracavity power .",
    "the real part of @xmath19 can be viewed as a combined effect of the mechanical stiffness and an additional spring ( _ optical spring_)@xcite .",
    "the delay in the intracavity field build - up , originating a contribution to the imaginary part of @xmath19 , causes a change in the oscillator damping that allows the optical cooling of its motion @xcite .",
    "for the case of our interest ( _ bad cavity limit _ @xmath20 , small detuning @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) the expression of optical spring constant simplifies to @xmath23 and the optical damping rate to @xmath24 allowing to write the effective susceptibility as @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 to our purpose , it is useful to underline that the frequency shift is approximately proportional to the detuning , and therefore a laser beam can be used to control it . moreover , by varying the working point ( detuning ) we can choose the effective resonance width @xmath28 and stabilize it .",
    "on the other hand , we remark that in general the optical spring increases the uncertainty and instability of the opto - mechanical resonance frequency @xmath29 since it is influenced by the noise in the laser intensity ( through @xmath30 ) , in the laser frequency and in the cavity length ( through @xmath31 ) .",
    "in addition , thermal effects due to the absorbed laser power can worsen the intrinsic stability of @xmath10 .",

    "the implementation of the wiener filtering is greatly facilitated and more effective by using a parametric control of the oscillator frequency , a technique that we have recently introduced and that we have analyzed here in details .",
    "thanks to such active stabilization , our system can reliably detect variations of the stochastic force below 1@xmath1 within one minute .",
    "we remark that a correct assessment of the really achievable resolution with long integration periods can not be simply based on the convergence of the averaged measurement .",
    "indeed , such indicator underestimates the effect of system long - term instabilities and parameter drifts . using the allan variance as correct estimator",
    ", we show that parametric control plays a crucial role in the achieved performance .    the procedure for the measurement of the stochastic force that we have described in this work , including optimal filtering and parametric control ,",
    "can be applied in a large variety of micro- and nano - mechanical systems , including those based on electric measurements and microwave radiation .",
    "detecting a weak stochastic signal on a stronger background is an important task in the research field of quantum mechanics with macroscopic oscillators , in particular when exploring the properties of oscillators with low occupation number , or , e.g. , in a squeezed state @xcite or other peculiarly quantum states .",
    "in this situation , the measurement back - action can destroy the interesting features .",
    "particular measurement schemes can be conceived and applied @xcite , but the use of a weak measurement , where the signature of the oscillator is intrinsically weaker than the measurement noise ( see , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can be a useful affordable solution .",
    "the procedures investigated in this work would thus provide a valuable help .",
