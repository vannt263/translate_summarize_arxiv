    "the most direct generalization of the iteration of holomorphic functions in the plane to higher real dimensions is the iteration of uniformly quasiregular mappings in @xmath1 . informally speaking ,",
    "quasiregular mappings allow a bounded amount of distortion .",
    "uniformly quasiregular mappings , abbreviated to uqr mappings , have a uniform bound for the distortion of all the iterates .",
    "these were introduced by iwaniec and martin @xcite who showed that there are direct analogues of the julia set and fatou set for uqr mappings and that @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that certain structures can arise as julia sets of uqr mappings :    * all of @xmath1 , arising from latts type examples @xcite , * the unit sphere @xmath3 arising from uqr versions of power mappings @xcite , * an @xmath4-ball @xmath5 in @xmath1 arising from uqr versions of chebyshev polynomials @xcite , * tame cantor sets arising from conformal trap methods @xcite .    here , a tame cantor set @xmath6 is one for which there exists a homeomorphism @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is a usual ternary cantor set contained in a line .",
    "a cantor set which is not tame is called wild .",
    "the first example of a wild cantor set was antoine s necklace @xcite , the construction of which we recall below . in the context of quasiregular mappings , heinonen and rickman",
    "@xcite constructed quasiregular mappings in @xmath9 that branch on a wild cantor set . in this paper , we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath10 be the square of a sufficiently large even integer .",
    "then there exist an antoine s necklace @xmath11 of multiplicity @xmath12 and a uniformly quasiregular map @xmath0 whose julia set @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "further , @xmath13 is the closure of the repelling periodic points of @xmath15 .",
    "antoine s necklace is constructed by an iterative procedure involving a link of @xmath12 solid tori contained in a solid torus .",
    "this even integer @xmath12 is called the multiplicity of the necklace .",
    "if @xmath12 is sufficiently large , then the necklace can be taken to be geometrically self - similar .",
    "the idea in the proof of this theorem is to interpolate between conformal similarities arising from the necklace construction and the uqr power mapping of mayer @xcite by first constructing an explicit branched cover , then applying an extension theorem of berstein and edmonds @xcite .",
    "the construction here can not happen in the plane since there are no wild cantor sets in @xmath16 .",
    "blankinship @xcite extended antoine s construction to produce wild cantor sets in higher dimensions .",
    "it is unknown whether a basic branched cover analogous to that in section [ sec : basic - cover ] exists in higher dimensions and whether berstein and edmonds theorem can be generalized to dimension four or higher . for these reasons",
    ", we restrict to dimension three in this paper .",
    "it is known that the julia set of a uqr mapping is the closure of the periodic points @xcite , but it is still an open question whether it is the closure of the repelling periodic points , as it is in the holomorphic setting . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that this question has an affirmative answer when @xmath13 is a tame cantor set , and the final assertion of theorem [ thm : main ] shows that there is an affirmative answer for at least some wild cantor sets .",
    "tame cantor sets arising as julia sets of uqr mappings were used in @xcite to construct quasiregular versions of poincar linearizers where the fast escaping set forms a structure called a spider s web . the natural question of whether there exist uqr mappings with wild cantor sets arose from this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : pre ] we recall the definition of quasiregular mappings and state results we will need for our construction . in section [ sec : cantor ] , the construction of antoine s necklace is recalled and , in particular , a geometrically self - similar version . the construction and verification of the properties of the uqr map constructed for the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is contained in sections [ sec : basic - cover ] and [ sec : f ] .",
