    "unlike natural systems , which eventually evolve to maximal entropy , cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems that are known for their strong modeling and self - organizational properties . defined on an infinite lattice ( in the usual one - dimensional case , an infinite sequence defined on the integers ) , even starting with complete disorder , evolution of cellular automata",
    "can generate organized structure .",
    "originally developed by von neuman in the 1940 s to model biological self - reproduction , cellular automata have long been used in computational , physical , and biological applications . for a more complete description of applications of cellular automata see @xcite , and @xcite . as with all dynamical systems",
    ", it is interesting to understand the long term behavior under forward time evolution and achieve an understanding or classification of the system .",
    "cellular automata can be defined for any dimension greater than or equal to one .",
    "this paper is concerned with one - dimensional or linear cellular automata defined on the integers ( when no confusion arises , we will refer to one - dimensional cellular automata as simply cellular automata ) .",
    "see figure 1 for an example of a one - dimensional cellular automaton .",
    "this is wolfram binary rule @xmath0 with range equal to 2 , see @xcite and @xcite . starting with a random initial configuration , the cellular automaton evolves ( under repeated applications ) downward . in this example , it s interesting to note the two persisting structures that emerge .",
    "the structure on the left evolves straight down , while the structure on the right evolves down on an angle and can eventually `` crash '' into other persisting structures .",
    "the concept of classifying cellular automata was initiated by stephen wolfram , see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "one - dimensional cellular automata are partitioned into four classes depending on their dynamical behavior .",
    "figure 1 ( rule @xmath0 ) is an example of a wolfram class @xmath1 cellular automaton .",
    "a later and more rigorous classification scheme , see @xcite , was developed by robert gilman . here",
    "a probabilistic / measure theoretic classification was developed based on the probability of choosing a sequence that will stay arbitrarily close to a given initial sequence under forward evolution ( iteration ) .",
    "gilman uses a metric that considers the central window where two sequences ( configurations ) agree and continue to agree upon forward iterations of a cellular automaton map .",
    "however , in the development , this metric is limited because it does nt take into account configurations that agree on an infinite interval to the right ( or respectively to the left ) .",
    "indeed , the metric considers the absolute value of the first integral place where configurations disagree and uses that as their distance apart , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , if configurations agree on the right hand side out to infinity but disagree in some finite position on the left , their distance apart is determined by where they disagree on the left . in this paper , the definition of cellular automata and the metric involved",
    "are extended to include configurations that do not necessarily agree on a finite central window symmetric around @xmath2 , and also which can agree on not necessarily symmetric infinite intervals .",
    "the classical concept of infinity has presented limitations in computations .",
    "indeed , metrics used on infinite sequences , and hence cellular automata , either do not allow us to observe minute differences or can lead to calculations beyond finite computations .",
    "analogous to the hamming distance for finite sequences , the following metric is used to compute distances between infinite sequences .",
    "@xmath3 here the differences in the respective sequence values are computed and divided by @xmath4 to ensure convergence .",
    "however , this procedure can lead to a calculation beyond finite computation and to possible inaccuracies .",
    "for instance , using the binary alphabet s=\\{0,1 } , suppose two sequences agree completely on the left of and at the @xmath5 place , and disagree elsewhere .",
    "that is , they disagree on the right of @xmath2 or for integral values @xmath6 . applying the traditional well known formula to ( [ equ_a ] ) yields @xmath7 and taking limits as @xmath8 approaches infinity , results in a value of @xmath9 . by using the _ infinite unit axiom _ ,",
    "see @xcite - @xcite , and @xmath10 ( the symbol @xmath11 is called grossone by sergeyev and represents the number of elements in the set of natural numbers ) , the computational limitations caused by sequences that agree out to one - sided infinity or that are subject to infinite computations are overcome . as shown for infinite @xmath8 ,",
    "that is for @xmath12 @xmath13 and note that @xmath14 is infinitesimal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence ( [ equ1 ] ) produces a more precise representation of the infinite sum computation .    before defining cellular automata with the infinite metric",
    "we need a few preliminaries .",
    "the set of integers is denoted by @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the set of natural numbers and let @xmath17 .",
    "given a finite alphabet @xmath18 with two or more symbols , i.e. @xmath19 , consider the space of all functions from the integers to the finite alphabet , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this space may also be considered as the space of all bi - infinite sequences , defined on the integers , with values taken from the alphabet @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "the following metric was used on the space @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 it is noted that this metric satisfies the ultrametric property .",
    "a metric @xmath22 satisfies the ultrametric property iff it is a metric and obeys the inequality : @xmath23\\ ] ] a space that satisfies the ultrametric inequality is also called a nonarchimedean space , see @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the triangle inequality is implied by the ultrametric inequality .",
    "as can be seen , the metric defined in ( [ equ2 ] ) above considers only the symmetric window around @xmath24 .",
    "two sequences may agree in more integral values on one side but this information is not communicated by the metric . in this paper",
    "this inaccuracy is overcome by using the infinite unit axiom , @xmath25 , and developing new machinery to work with infinite sequences .",
    "it is noted that , in a nonarchimedean space given two open disks either one contains the other or they intersect trivially .",
    "the following definitions , lemmas and theorem will be used to develop the framework for a generalized nonarchimedean metric on the space of bi - infinite sequences .",
    "a @xmath26 ( lower tree semi - lattice ) is a lower semi - lattice with lower element @xmath27 having the _ semi - total ordering _ property . a lower semi lattice has the binary operator infimum @xmath28 such that the following laws hold :    1 .   idempotent law @xmath29 2 .",

    ".    by construction @xmath61 is positive definite , and symmetric .",
    "the ultrametric triangle inequality : @xmath62 $ ] holds since if two or more elements in @xmath63 are equal then at least one term from @xmath62 $ ] is zero and the others are equal to each other .",

    "@xmath53 is the set of all maps from the integers to @xmath73 .",
    "that is , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "it is noted that the set @xmath73 is compact and hence the product space @xmath76 is also compact .",
    "as the next definitions show , the infinite unit axiom will be applied and used in the construction of the metric for computations with infinite sequences .",
    "the above lemmas and theorem show that the constructed metric is an ultrametric and the space is nonarchimedean .",
    "let @xmath77   \\;\\ ; and \\ ; * outside   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] note : @xmath78 and can equal @xmath79 , similarly @xmath80 can equal @xmath11 .",
    "hence computations on infinite sequences are allowed .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is the place where two sequences agree on the largest stretch around @xmath2 and is @xmath32 valued outside .",
    "@xmath82 we form the following metric on the space of bi - infinite sequences : @xmath83    given @xmath84 , let @xmath85 and @xmath86 in our examples , when not explicitly denoted , we will use the symbol @xmath87 to denote the zeroth place .",

    "@xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 hence , the distance between the two points @xmath88 and @xmath89 is infinitesimal .",

    "the following is a simple , but important , example of a cellular automaton of range @xmath128 .",
    "the evolutionary behavior of this automaton is clearly exhibited .",
    "let @xmath129 and let @xmath108 be the automaton induced by the local rule @xmath130 by @xmath131 and @xmath132 otherwise . if we apply forward iterations of the induced automaton map @xmath108 , all sequences eventually go to the quiescent state of @xmath133 , except for the initial sequence @xmath134 which remains constant",

    "hence it makes sense to determine how many elements are in these open disks .",
    "theorem @xmath136 and its corollary below will answer this question . there are numerous other examples of cellular automata maps . a more chaotic rule can be seen via the following example .",
    "let @xmath129 and let @xmath108 be the automaton induced by the local rule @xmath130 by @xmath137 .",
    "applying forward iterations of the induced automaton map @xmath108 yields no particular pattern . beginning with an initial random configuration in @xmath138 can yield many different configuration sequences .    given the space @xmath20 of bi - infinite sequences , the number of elements @xmath139 is equal to @xmath140    * proof : * @xmath141 is the number of elements of the finite alphabet @xmath18 . over the integers , @xmath15 , there are exactly @xmath11 elements to the right and exactly @xmath11 elements to the left of @xmath2",

    "observed , after extensive computer simulations , that the dynamics of a cellular automaton map can behave differently under different initial configurations .",
    "however , it was also observed that if the configuration was chosen at random , the probability is high that the dynamical behavior of the automaton map @xmath108 will lie in one of four classes . in @xcite gilman",
    "shows that a cellular automaton must lie in one of three classes .",
    "these classes are determined by the probability of finding another configuration that stays arbitrarily close to an initial configuration .",
    "hence it makes sense to study cellular automata by determining the number of configurations that stay within a certain distance of the initial configuration under the automaton map .    to understand the dynamics of cellular automata it is necessary to study the forward iterates of configurations that stay  close \" to those of a given configuration , call it `` @xmath88 '' .",
