    "the electroweak precision measurements performed at lep , sld and tevatron have provided a powerful test of the standard model ( sm ) and set tight constraints on generic models of new physics .",
    "they represent a challenge especially for theories where electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) originates from new strong dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "composite higgs models  @xcite are currently the most interesting representative of this class of theories , as they can accommodate naturally a light higgs boson .",
    "the experimental information on universal corrections to the precision observables at the @xmath7 pole can be conveniently summarized in terms of the three @xmath8 parameters  @xcite , whose measured value is of order @xmath9 with an error of @xmath10 .",
    "a first important correction to the @xmath11 in composite higgs models arises as a consequence of the modified couplings of the higgs to the @xmath12 and @xmath7 bosons  @xcite .",
    "the largest effect comes in particular from the imperfect cancellation of the logarithmic divergence between 1-loop diagrams with higgs and ew vector bosons .",
    "the residual divergence , absent in the  sm , can be interpreted as the running of local effective operators between the scale of new physics @xmath13 and the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "this leads to a shift to the  @xmath11 which is naively of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the decay constant of the composite higgs and @xmath16 . besides the running",
    ", a second effect comes from threshold corrections .",
    "those at the ew scale are model independent ; they have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and are small ( of order @xmath17 ) .",
    "threshold corrections at the new physics scale @xmath13 are instead large , as resonance exchange can give a tree - level contribution to the  @xmath11 . in this case",
    "one naively expects shifts of order @xmath18 , so that a per mille precision on the @xmath11 implies a lower limit on @xmath13 at the @xmath19tev level .",
    "given the experimental accuracy , one - loop corrections from the resonances can also give an important contribution .",
    "compared to the ir running they are subleading by a factor @xmath20 , although this latter is numerically not very large in natural scenarios ( e.g. @xmath21 for @xmath22tev ) and can be compensated by a multiplicity factor from the loop of resonances or simply by a numerical accidental enhancement .",
    "for example , one - loop corrections from fermionic resonances to @xmath23 are enhanced by color and generation multiplicity factors  @xcite , while those to @xmath24 represent the leading effect from new physics if the strong dynamics is custodially symmetric  @xcite .    aim of this work is to compute the one - loop threshold corrections due to spin-1 resonances in composite higgs models .",
    "these effects were studied in detail in the framework of strongly - interacting higgless models ( with an @xmath25 coset ) , for which computations exist both in the diagrammatic approach  @xcite and through the use of dispersion relations  @xcite .",

    "these latter are assumed to be lighter and more weakly interacting than the other composite states at the cutoff .",
    "although this working assumption might not be realized by the underlying strong dynamics , we expect our calculation to give a quantitative approximate description of the contributions from spin-1 resonances arising in full models .",
