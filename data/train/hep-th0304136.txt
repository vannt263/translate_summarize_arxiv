    "in the present paper we continue the investigation of new quantum systems originating from the representation theory of basic classical lie superalgebras .",
    "in particular , we study further the properties of a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) wigner quantum oscillator whose mathematical background involves the lie superalgebra @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the idea itself behind these investigations stems from the 1950 s paper of wigner _ do the equations of motion determine the quantum mechanical commutation relations ?",
    "_  @xcite . in this paper wigner has generalized a result of ehrenfest  @xcite . the latter stated ( up to ordering details , which are irrelevant in our case ) that in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics hamilton s ( resp .",
    "the heisenberg ) equations are a unique consequence of the canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) and the heisenberg ( resp .",
    "hamilton s ) equations .",
    "wigner has proved a stronger statement .",
    "he has shown through an example that hamilton s equations can be identical to the heisenberg equations even if the position and momentum operators do not satisfy the ccrs .",
    "wigner s example was a one - dimensional oscillator with a hamiltonian @xmath15 , in units such that @xmath16 . abandoning the requirement @xmath17=i$ ] , wigner searched for all operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that hamilton s equations @xmath20 and @xmath21 are identical with the heisenberg equations @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the canonical solution he found infinitely many other solutions , that is infinitely many solutions for the pair @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "he interpreted these as position and momentum operators despite the fact that they do not satisfy the ccrs @xmath17=i$ ] .",
    "different aspects of wigner s idea were studied by several authors . among the earlier references we mention  @xcite-@xcite , but",
    "the subject still remains of interest  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the key motivation for a generalization of the concept of a quantum system  @xcite comes from the observation of wigner  @xcite that the heisenberg equations and hamilton s equations have a more immediate physical significance than the canonical commutation relations . from this point of view",
    "it is logically justified to postulate as the starting point the heisenberg equations and hamilton s equations instead of the ccrs .    the conjecture that the ccrs have to be modified , including the possibility that the configuration space coordinates may not mutually commute , originated recently from string theory ( we refer to  @xcite for a survey on the subject ) and also from quantum groups ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , the idea itself was already suggested by heisenberg in the late 1930 s ( as explained in  @xcite ) , and perhaps the first example of this kind was given by snyder  @xcite .",
    "the above observations justify the consideration of what we call a wigner quantum system  @xcite . as in  @xcite , a wigner quantum system ( wqs )",
    "differs from a canonical quantum system only by the replacement of the postulate on canonical commutation relations by a new postulate .",
    "in particular , consider an @xmath26-particle system in three dimensions with hamiltonian = _",
    "= 1^n _ ^2 + v ( _ 1 , _ 2 ,  , _",
    "n ) , [ 1.1 ] which depends on the @xmath27 variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , to be interpreted as ( cartesian ) coordinates and momenta , respectively .",
    "just as in ordinary quantum mechanics , the following conditions should hold :    * the state space @xmath31 is a hilbert space . to every physical observable @xmath32",
    "there corresponds a hermitian ( self - adjoint ) operator @xmath33 acting in @xmath31 .",
    "* the observable @xmath32 can take on only those values which are eigenvalues of @xmath33 .",
    "the expectation value of the observable @xmath32 in a state @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the scalar product of @xmath37 .",
    "together with others , these postulates are common to any quantum system .",
    "we repeat only * p1 * and * p2 * here because we will explicitly make use of them .",
    "the difference with canonical quantum mechanics comes from postulating * p3 * :    * hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations hold and are identical ( as operator equations ) in @xmath31 .    in the canonical case instead of * p3 * one postulates the validity of the heisenberg equations and the ccrs . then ,",
    "as mentioned above , hamilton s equations hold too .    here , we shall no longer use the ccrs , but rely on * p3 * instead .",
    "the corresponding system is called a wigner quantum system . although @xmath28 and @xmath29 no longer satisfy the ccrs , following wigner ( and the related papers  @xcite-@xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we shall still interpret them as the operators corresponding to measurements of the physical position and momentum of the wqs and refer to them as position and momentum operators .",
    "let us point out again that the above postulates do not provide a complete description of wigner quantum systems nor of wigner quantum oscillators to be studied in the present paper . on the ground of",
    "these postulates alone one can not determine the expressions for the operators of the angular momentum , for instance .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning that postulate * p3 * can be weakened ( so far only in the 1d case ) in a manner consistent with wigner s ideas  @xcite so that deformed quantum oscillators  @xcite and , more generally , daskaloyannis oscillators  @xcite can be viewed as ( generalized ) wigner oscillators .",
    "our approach to wigner quantum oscillators is essentially based on two observations .",
    "the first one , due to kamefuchi and ohnuki  @xcite , is the proof that all solutions found by wigner are different representations of _ just one pair _ of para - bose ( pb ) creation and annihilation operators ( caos ) @xmath38 .",
    "more generally , we recall that the ( representation independent ) pb operators , which generalize bose statistics , are defined by the relations  @xcite : = ( -)_ikb_j^+(-)_jkb_i^ ,  i , j , k=1,2, ",
    ",n ,  , , = , [ 1.2 ] ( where , by convention , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are written as @xmath42 when used as superscripts , and as @xmath43 when used algebraically in the factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . here and throughout the paper @xmath46 and @xmath47=xy - yx$ ] for any @xmath48 .",
    "the second relevant observation is that any @xmath49 pairs of pb operators @xmath50 are odd elements , generating a lie superalgebra  @xcite , isomorphic to the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the fock spaces of any @xmath49 pairs of parabosons and in particular of bosons are irreducible @xmath51 modules . in this terminology the oscillator of wigner can be called an @xmath52 oscillator , its position and momentum operators are the odd generators of @xmath52 , the hamiltonian is a simple polynomial of the position and momentum operators and the solutions found by wigner are different irreducible representations of this lie superalgebra .    the @xmath51 lie superalgebra is a basic classical lie superalgebra from class @xmath53 in the classification of kac  @xcite .",
    "in fact  ( [ 1.2 ] ) yields one possible definition of @xmath51 : the associative superalgebra with unity , subject to the relations  ( [ 1.2 ] ) is the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath51 .",
    "the results of wigner can be easily extended to any @xmath49-dimensional harmonic oscillator , turning it into a wigner quantum oscillator ( wqo ) . to this end",
    "one has first to express the hamiltonian via bose operators [ b_i^-,b_j^+]=_ij = [ b_i^-,b_j^-]=0 ,    i , j=1, ",
    ",n , [ 1.3 ] and their anticommutators and subsequently replace them with pb operators  ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding solutions are now associated with infinite - dimensional irreducible representation of the lie superalgebra @xmath51 . since",
    "this superalgebra is of class @xmath53 we refer to the statistics of the canonical quantum oscillator ( cqo ) ( and its pb generalization ) as being @xmath53-superstatistics .    having observed all this , it was natural to ask whether one can satisfy the postulates * p1-p3 * with position and momentum operators which generate algebras from the other , different from @xmath53 , classes of basic lie superalgebras .",
    "a positive answer to this question was given in  @xcite with operators @xmath54 which satisfy certain relations that we will specify in the next section .",
    "these ensure that they generate the lie superalgebra @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding solutions are this time associated with a wigner quantum system that takes the form of an @xmath49-dimensional _ non - canonical _ wigner quantum oscillator .",
    "since the special linear lie superalgebra @xmath55 is of class @xmath56 we refer to the statistics of this wqo as being @xmath56-superstatistics .    in a similar approach barut and bracken  @xcite",
    "have described the internal dynamics ( _ zitterbewegung _ ) of dirac s electron .",
    "their creation and annihilation operators satisfy similar triple relations as in our case ( eqs .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) ) , but instead of a lie superalgebra they generate the lie algebra @xmath57 .    in the present paper",
    "we study further the properties of the 3d wqo , related to the @xmath0 superalgebra and initiated in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  2",
    "we outline the mathematical structure of the 3d non - canonical oscillator .",
    "the compatibility between the heisenberg equations and the hamilton s equations is achieved with operators @xmath58 which satisfy triple relations similar to those for the para - bose case  ( [ 1.2 ] ) , but this time they generate the lie superalgebra @xmath0 .",
    "the fock spaces @xmath1 of these operators are defined .",
    "the inequivalent representations are labeled by one positive integer  @xmath59 . for @xmath7",
    "all fock spaces are 8-dimensional , whereas in the case @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath63 ) . in the terminology of kac  @xcite the @xmath12 representations",
    "are called atypical representations . for this reason we refer to the fock spaces @xmath14 and @xmath13 as to atypical , to the corresponding oscillator as to atypical etc .",
    "we shall see in the next sections that the properties of the atypical oscillators are very different from those with @xmath7 .",
    "in section  3 we recall the known  @xcite physical properties of the @xmath0 wqos .",
    "firstly , the oscillator has finite space dimensions and the hamiltonian has no more than 4 different eigenvalues . in the stationary states",
    "the distance of the particle to the origin is quantized so that the particle is constrained to move on one of 4 possible spheres .",
    "secondly , the geometry of the oscillator is non - commutative .",
    "the various coordinates do not commute with one another , nor do the various components of the momentum .",
    "therefore , in particular , the position of the particle on the corresponding sphere can not be localized . in this respect",
    "the wqo belongs to the class of models of non - commutative quantum oscillators  @xcite-@xcite and , more generally , to theories with non - commutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "it is shown , however , that the non - commutativity between our position and momentum operators is different from the non - commutativity appearing in the most commonly adopted form of generalized heisenberg commutation relations ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3.4a ] ) ) .",
    "all results after section  3 are new . in section  4",
    "the probabilistic distribution of the particle is analyzed .",
    "the basis consists of stationary states .",
    "the main result is the following : if the particle is in one of the basis states with @xmath7 , then measurements of its coordinates are consistent with it only being found at 8 particular points on a sphere which form the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "thus as in  @xcite , the coordinates of the particle are observables with a quantized spectrum just like energy , angular momentum , etc .",
    "the number of points , called `` nests '' , can be even less in the atypical cases . in certain states with @xmath61",
    "the oscillator is becoming a flat object with 4 vertices ( figure  2 ) .",
    "there are three states in the @xmath60 case when the oscillator is even one - dimensional ( figure  3 ) . in section  5",
    "the mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the position and momenta operators for an arbitrary state are written down .",
    "it is shown ( conclusion  3 ) that there exists no nontrivial analogue of the heisenberg uncertainty relations since one can always find a state @xmath64 for which either @xmath65 or @xmath66 .    in section  6",
    "we show that despite the fact that the @xmath0 oscillator is very different from the 3d canonical oscillator , they still have some features in common . in particular we show that to each @xmath60 mean trajectory of the @xmath0 oscillator there corresponds exactly the same trajectory of the 3-dimensional canonical oscillator .",
    "let @xmath67 be the hamiltonian of a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator , that is = ^2 2 m + m^22 ^ 2 .",
    "[ 2.1 ] we proceed to view this oscillator as a wigner quantum system and work throughout in the heisenberg picture in which the operators are , in general , time dependent .",
    "according to postulate * p3 * the operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 have to be defined in such a way that hamilton s equations = -m^2 ,   = 1m[2.2 ] and the heisenberg equations = i[h , ] ,   = i[h , ] [ 2.3 ] are both valid , and are identical as operator equations .",
    "these equations are compatible only if [ h,]=im ^2 ,   [ h,]=-i . [ 2.4 ]    the most general solution of  ( [ 2.2 ] ) and  ( [ 2.3 ] ) is not known .",

    "it is clear that while alternative , non - canonical solutions to the compatibility equations ( [ 2.4 ] ) between hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations exist in our @xmath0 wqo model , they are in several very important respects quite different from the canonical solutions .",
    "firstly , each state space @xmath1 of our one particle 3d wqo is finite - dimensional ; 8-dimensional in the case of typical representations of @xmath0 , and either @xmath300 or @xmath301-dimensional in the case of atypical representations .    secondly , both the energy and the angular momentum are quantized , with equally spaced energy levels , all positive and with separation @xmath302 , and with the angular momentum restricted to be @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "since there are only a finite number of energy levels , the energy is bounded .",
    "the degeneracies are always either @xmath9 or @xmath145 .",
    "the lowest energy state is non - degenerate in all the typical cases , but degenerate in each of the atypical cases .",
    "thirdly , the spectrum of coordinates is also quantized , to the extent that in any stationary state measurements of the coordinates @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 give values consistent only with the particle being found at a finite number of possible sites , namely the various nests that we have identified . in the typical , @xmath7 case , the number of possible nests is @xmath303 , while in the atypical cases it is @xmath304 if @xmath61 and only @xmath305 if @xmath60 . in all cases",
    "the distance of the particle from the origin is bounded and may take on only the values @xmath306 with @xmath307 such that @xmath119 .",
    "fourthly , not only is the mean trajectory of the particle in any stationary state zero , but there exist both typical and atypical states for which the standard deviation of some coordinate @xmath70 , or some component of linear momentum @xmath71 , is also zero .",
    "this implies that for the wqo there exists no uncertainty relation involving a non - zero uncertainty parameter @xmath270 that applies to all states at all times .",
    "fifthly , the atypical case is distinguished from the typical case in possessing stationary states of dimension lower than three , namely two - dimensional in the case @xmath61 and one - dimensional in the case @xmath60 .",
    "many of these non - standard results are a consequence of the fact that the underlying geometry of this wqo model is non - commutative .",
    "this means that their interpretation must be undertaken carefully .",
    "in particular it should be stressed that it is not possible to specify precisely the position of the particle .",
    "fortunately , the square operators @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 not only mutually commute but also commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "their common eigenstates are the stationary states @xmath113 , for which the eigenvalues of @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are simultaneously fixed to be either @xmath59 , @xmath308 or @xmath309 .",
    "thus the spectrum of the measured values of each of the coordinates themselves , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , is necessarily restricted to the set of values @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "any measurement of a coordinate , @xmath173 say , results in one or other of the allowed positive or negative values of @xmath173 with , as we have shown , equal probability , leaving the signs of the other coordinates undetermined . thus the particle in a stationary state",
    "@xmath113 has a certain probability of being within one or other of the relevant nests , but it is not to be thought of as localized in any particular nest .    in this article we have restricted ourselves to the relatively simple case of an @xmath313 , single particle 3-dimensional wqo with a relatively low , @xmath314-dimensional fock space @xmath1 associated with typical irreducible representations of @xmath0 , and even lower dimensions for atypical representations . a very natural next step is to generalize the results to the case of an @xmath26-body 3-dimensional wqo as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in such a case the dimension of the fock space is @xmath315-dimensional for typical representations , and again lower dimensions for atypical representations .",
    "the relevant calculations are somewhat intricate and will be the subject of a separate article , in which the restriction from the lie superalgebra @xmath316 to the simple lie algebra @xmath98 of the rotation group plays a key role in the determination of the possible angular momentum states of our multiparticle system .",
    "it suffices to say at this stage that not only are the energy and angular momentum quantized and bounded but , in the corresponding stationary states of fixed energy and angular momentum , so are the single particle coordinates and components of linear momentum .",
    "as is to be expected the corresponding nest structure is more complicated and we have to contend with the relevant class @xmath56 statistics , and account for the numbers of particles whose coordinates , when measured , can coincide with those of the nests , as well as more complicated patterns of degeneracy .",
    "further generalizations also come to mind .",
    "in particular the class of irreducible representations considered here are those specified by the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "there exist other finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath0 , and more generally of @xmath316 , that are specified not just by a single positive integer @xmath59 , but by a partition or equivalently a sequence of kac - dynkin indices  @xcite .",
    "these can be expected to provide other interesting models of the wigner quantum oscillator in the one - particle case and , more particularly , in multi - particle cases .",
    "at the same time it would be interesting to explore in the same way other non - oscillator wigner quantum systems . for examples of this kind",
