    "the measurements of distances of type ia snae on cosmological scales ( up to @xmath7 ; riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , when interpreted in the standard friedmann - lemaitre cosmological models , imply that the universe expansion is accelerating . when such measurements are compared with those concerning the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; see dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) , the correlation length of large scale - structures ( eisenstein et al . 2005 ) , or the abundance of galaxy clusters ( bahcall et al . 2003 ) , they indicate that 70 % of the energy density in the universe is constituted by some sort of negative pressure field ( named dark energy de ) .",
    "its contribution @xmath8 ( in units of the critical density ) results to be larger ( but of the same order at present time ) than the energy density @xmath9 contributed by dark matter ( dm ) , and much larger than that from ordinary baryonic matter @xmath10 .",
    "although such results can be accommodated in a `` concordance cosmology '' ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) consistent with a wide set of observations , they pose an enormous challenge for fundamental physics , when interpreted in terms of vacuum energy density ( for a critical discussion see bianchi , rovelli , kolb 2010 and references therein ) .    in fact , while the proposed extensions of the particle physics standard model provide natural candidates for the dm , the nature of de constitutes a real conundrum .",
    "the simplest candidate is the einstein cosmological constant ( see carrol , press , turner 1992 ; weinberg 1989 ; sahni , starobinsky 2000 ) , characterized by constant energy density @xmath11 and pressure @xmath12 , yielding an equation of state @xmath13 .",
    "however , when interpreted in terms of vacuum energy density , the value required to induce the observed acceleration would be unnaturally small @xmath14 compared to the natural energy scales in particle physics ; besides , the coincidence problem of why this value is at present close to the dm energy density has no natural explanation ( zlatev , wang , steinhardt 1999 ) .",
    "the problems related to the above fine tuning have led to consider the general case where the de equation - of - state ratio @xmath15 varies with time ( here expressed in terms of the universe scale factor @xmath16 ) .",
    "such a _ dynamical _ dark energy ( dde ) is indeed expected if the de results from the pressure @xmath17 and the energy density @xmath18 of a scalar field @xmath19 ( named quintessence , see peebles , ratra 1988 ; caldwell , dave , steinhardt 1998 ; sahni , wang , 2000 ; copeland , sahni , tsujikawa , 2006 ; frieman , turner , huterer 2008 ) evolving in a potential @xmath20 .",
    "a time - varying @xmath15 also provides a phenomenological rendition of modifications in the friedmann equations for the rate of expansion ( see linder , jenkins 2003 ) due to alternative theories of gravitation .",
    "characterizing the de equation of state would constitute a fundamental step toward understanding the nature of de , with a great impact on fundamental physics , involving quantum theory , high - energy physics , gravitational physics and astrophysics .",
    "however , at present the time evolution of the equation of state is not very well constrained .",
    "recent constraints come from : i ) type ia supernovae .",
    "these are based on measurements of snae luminosity - distances up to @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , davis et al .",
    "2007 ) ; ii ) cmb power spectrum , based on the measurements of the angular - diameter distance corresponding to the baryonic acoustic scale at the time of recombination ( @xmath21 ) ; iii ) the baryonic acoustic oscillations observed in the correlation function of galaxies at @xmath22 , providing a ruler to measure the ratio of the distances to @xmath23 and @xmath21 ( eisenstein et al . 2005 ) .",
    "further constraints on dde could be provided by the weak lensing tomography , i.e. , the measurement of the distortion in the images of distant source galaxies due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution of the universe , over a range of cosmic times ( massey et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the size of these distortions depends upon both the distances travelled , and upon the growth function @xmath24 which determines the amplitude of the deflector mass concentrations ( amara & refregier 2007 ; see refregier 2003 for a review ) .    combining the above measurements still leaves allowed a relatively large volume of the parameter space for the local value and the time variation of the equation - of - state parameter ( see , e.g , linder & jenkins 2003 ; komatsu et al .",
    "2008 ; li , xia , fan , zhangm 2008 ; kowalski et al .",
    "2008 ) ; parametrizing its evolution as @xmath25 ( an expression shown by linder 2003 to provide an excellent approximation to a wide variety of scalar fields and other de models ) , present observations yield @xmath26 and @xmath27 . note that when @xmath1 is not restricted to be constant the fit to the observations improves dramatically ( see huterer , cooray 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , the best fit is provided by models with @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 evidence ) ; such a property would violate the null energy condition so that @xmath31 , and the corresponding field is usually referred to as `` phantom energy '' ( see alcaniz 2004 ; carrol , hoffman , trodden 2003 ; amendola 2004 ) .",
    "such a form of de would most naturally lead to a big rip , i.e. , to an infinite energy density increase in a finite time ( caldwell , kamionkowski , weinberg 2003 ) .",
    "as for the dynamical evolution , the fits to snia data mildly favour an evolving equation of state with @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , feng , wang , zhang 2005 ; upadhye , ishak , steinhardt 2005 ) , implying a crossing of the value @xmath33 at redshift @xmath34 ( this kind of evolving dde was dubbed `` quintom '' , see , e.g. , see feng et al .",
    "2005 ) , a dynamics which differs from quintessence and phantom in determining the fate and the evolution of the universe ( see guo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one important reason why the above observational constraints to dde still allow large regions of the parameter space is they all involve either integrals of the hubble expansion rate @xmath35 over a large cosmic time ( from @xmath36 to the present ) or the value of @xmath37 at relatively low redshifts @xmath38",
    ". this would actually be sufficient to severely constrain de if its equation of state was indeed constant , since its contribution to the energy density would become rapidly much smaller than the dm contribution ( increasing like @xmath39 ) at @xmath7 .",
    "however , time varying models with @xmath32 possess different behaviour from the @xmath40 constant cases even at high redshifts ( see , e.g. , linder , jenkins 2003 ) both in the expansion rate @xmath37 and in the growth factor @xmath41 of dm overdensities @xmath42 present at some initial time @xmath43 .",
    "extending the methods discussed above to higher redshifts to provide tighter constraints on dde is a recognized priority for astrophysical research in the next future ( see the national academy of science report 2010 ) , and is involving a major effort of the international community .",
    "tighter constraints on dde equation of state will be provided by the nasa jdem - wfirst space mission ( see gehrels 2010 ) operating a 1.5-meter wide - field - of - view near - infrared - imaging and low - resolution - spectroscopy telescope ; this will extend bao and snia measurements to @xmath44 , yielding a reduction of a factor @xmath45 in the allowed area of the @xmath46 plane ( see frieman , turner , huterer 2008 ) . the esa space mission euclid ( see laurejis et al .",
    "2008 ) will consist of a 1.2 m telescope placed in l2 orbit , and is optimised for weak gravitational lensing and bao so as to achive measurements of the dde equation of state with @xmath47 .",
    "a great statistical improvement will be achieved with the ground - based 8.4 m large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; ivezic et al .",
    "2010 ) , that will observe a 20 000 deg@xmath48 region with a final limiting magnitude of @xmath49 , providing , e.g. , an unprecedented sample of @xmath50 billion lensing galaxies .",
    "the above methods and experiments are all based either on the well - established standard friedman - laimaitre models providing the dependence of distances on cosmological parameters , or on the evolution of linear density perturbations , for which we have a solid physical description to be compared with observations .",
    "however , measuring @xmath15 over a wide range of cosmic times could in principle be achieved through observations involving high - contrast , non - linear cosmic structures .",
    "one example is the measurement of the redshift - space distortions , the imprint of large - scale peculiar velocities on observed galaxy maps ( see guzzo et al .",
    "2008 ) ; since gravity - driven coherent motions are a direct consequence of the growth of structures , measurements of the redshift - space two - point correlation function can be mapped into estimates of the growth factor @xmath24 .",
    "alternatively , a measurement of the dde equation of state could be achieved by comparing the observed abundance of high - contrast cosmic structures , like clusters of galaxies with given dm mass ( see borgani & guzzo 2001 ) , with the abundances computed assuming different background dde ( see wang , steinhardt , 1998 ; mota , van der bruck 2004 ; nunes , mota 2006 ; mota , shaw , silk 2008 ) .",
    "the drawback of these methods is that the observed properties of such structures are related to their underlying dm distribution by the complex physics of gas and star formation ; the uncertainties in the modelling of such processes are in general larger than the effects due to different assumed dde cosmologies , and at present are not competitive with bao and snia methods in constraining the dde equation of state , although cluster abundances measured with the xmm xxl survey ( pierre et al .",
    "2011 ) and erosita ( predhel et al . 2010 ; cappelluti et al . 2010 ) are expected to provide substantial improvements in the next few years .",
    "however , these methods probe the de equation of state at @xmath51 .",
    "there are , however , objects that can be suitable for the above task , and that can probe dde models at higher redshifts .",
    "these are the most massive black holes ( bhs ) residing in the centre of massive high - redshift galaxies , and observed ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) to shine as quasars ( qsos ) already at early cosmic times ( @xmath52 ) ; these are the high - redshift , high - luminosity representatives of the active galactic nuclei emitting over the whole electromagnetic spectrum due to the accretion of gas onto the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , observed to be hosted in the bulges of local galaxies ( see , e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "they are thought to originate from seed bhs of @xmath53 produced by the collapse of popiii stars at high redshift @xmath54 ( see madau & rees 2001 ) , which subsequently grow through merging and accretion .",
    "both such processes must be physically related with the growth of their host galaxies , since the bh masses and the properties of the host ( e.g. , with the stellar mass ) are very tightly correlated ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "besides , both processes are characterized by upper limits : the merging rate of bhs is limited by that of their host galaxies ( see volonteri , hardt & madau 2003 ) , which at high redshifts @xmath55 is smaller - but of the same order of magnitude - of the merging rate of the dm haloes collapsed from the peaks of the dm density field ( see lacey & cole 1993 ) , primary related to the growth factor of dm perturbations ; the accretion rate is limited by the eddington rate @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the accretion efficiency and @xmath58 is the bh mass ; thus the maximal mass accretion rate is @xmath59 yielding an exponential mass growth @xmath60 $ ] where @xmath61 yrs .",
    "the discovery of bhs of masses @xmath62 already in place at @xmath52 ( barth et al . 2003 ; willott , mclure , jarvis 2003 ) clearly provides a challenge for cosmological models .",
    "although such objects are extremely rare , with a number density @xmath63 , cosmological models must allow for the building up of such massive bhs from @xmath64 seeds at @xmath65 , a huge mass growth in a short lapse of cosmic time ( only 600 myrs for the concordance cosmology ) .",
    "our scope is to investigate which dde models provide i ) a cosmic time available for bh accretion since @xmath0 and ii ) a growth factor ( determining the bh merging rate ) large enough to allow for the early building up of the observed population of smbhs .    using the abundance of such objects at high redshifts @xmath52 as a probe of dde has several advantages : i ) they are characterized by a _",
    "growth that can be easily modelled ; ii ) their maximal accretion rate is _ exponentially _ sensitive to the cosmic time @xmath66 ; iii ) at high redshifts , the _ maximal _ merging rate of bhs is directly related to ( and limited by ) the growth factor of the galactic dm haloes where they reside ; iv ) they form on the _ exponential _ tail of the dm mass distribution , so their predicted abundance is _ exponentially _ dependent on the mass grown by redshift @xmath52 , making the comparison with observations an extremely sensible probe .    to pursue our goal we shall develop an analytic approach to derive robust upper limits for the growth of the bhs mass functions up to @xmath52 with different dde background cosmologies .",
    "we shall compare the predicted abundance of bhs with masses @xmath67 at such redshift with the observed number density , to derive exclusion regions for the parameter space of dde models which allow to reduce the regions allowed by other up - to - date observational probes ( like snia , bao , or cmb ) ; in fact , we shall show that the abundance of high - redshift qsos is able to disfavour some of the dde models presently providing very good fits to the combined data from the above observations ( @xmath28 and @xmath68 ) , and in particular the quintom scenario .",
    "our computation will provide solid constraints for dde model provided three basic conditions are verified , at least for high bh masses @xmath69 and for high redshifts @xmath70 .",
    "these are : 1 ) the bhs form from primordial seeds with mass @xmath71 originating from the collapse of popiii stars at @xmath72 ; 2 ) the eddington limit for the accretion rate holds at all times ; 3 ) the average accretion efficiency verifies @xmath73 . we shall discuss the validity of such conditions in sect . 2 and in the conclusions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe our analytical approach to derive upper limits on the growth of the bh mass function ; in sect .",
    "3 we shall compare the predictions for different dde models with the observed abundances of @xmath52 smbhs , and derive severe exclusion regions for the dde parameters ; sect .",
    "4 is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "here we present an analytical approach to follow the evolution of the bh mass function in a cosmological framework . in such a framework , galaxies form from the collapse of the peaks of primordial dm density field , and grow through repeated merging events . at high redshifts ,",
    "the large densities of baryons collapsing in the dm haloes allow for rapid gas cooling ( rees , ostriker 1977 ) , so that copious cold gas reservoirs are available for both star formation and bh accretion ( see , e.g. , baugh 2006 for a review ) .",
    "subsequently , bhs grow by accretion of cold galactic gas and by merging with other bhs following the coalescence of the host galaxies .",
    "we describe below how we model the corresponding evolution of the bh mass function , maximizing the parameters related to their accretion , for any background cosmology .",
    "cosmic structures form in dm haloes collapsed from tiny overdensities ( @xmath74 ) of a primordial gaussian density field ( see padmanabhan 1993 ; peebles 1993 , peacock 1999 , coles and lucchin 2002 ) . measurements of the cmb first with cobe ( smoot 1992 ) and later with boomerang ( de bernardis et al .",

    "the critical threshold @xmath77 for the collapse of density fluctuations also depends weakly on cosmology , ranging from @xmath86 for the concordance cosmology to @xmath87 of a critical @xmath88 cosmology ( see mainini , maccio , bonometto , klypin 2003 ) .",
    "when two dm galactic haloes merge , the dynamical friction against the dm background and the stars , and the viscous effects from the surrounding gas drag the hosted bhs towards the centre of the most massive dm halo , where they form a binary system , loose orbital energy through the emission of gravitational waves and eventually coalesce ( volonteri , hardt , madau 2003 ; callegari et al .",
    "2009 ; see colpi , dotti 2009 for a review ) .",
    "several processes may delay ( or even inhibit ) the coalescence of bhs inside merged dm haloes ( milosavlejevic & merritt 2001 ) , so that the dm merging rate provides an effective _ upper limit _ to the bh merging .    besides merging , smbhs grow through accretion of cold galactic gas . the relation between the dynamical evolution of galaxies in the dm haloes and the fraction of gas feeding the bh accretion depends on the complex physics linking the formation of accretion disks on sub - pc scales to the processes involving the evolution of the galactic gas .",
    "however , an _ upper limit _ to the accretion luminosity is provided by the eddington value @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the electron scattering opacity ) yielding for the accretion rate a maximal value @xmath91 , where @xmath57 is the accretion efficiency , specified by the fractional binding energy of the innermost stable circular orbit about the hole .",

    "nevertheless , we expect our upper limit for the merging rate to provide a fair description of the actual rate , since at high redshifts the dynamical friction is very efficient in dragging the bhs in merging haloes toward the centre of the merger ( see bough 2006 for a review ) ; this is a specific property of hierarchical scenarios , characterized by a two - phase growth of cosmic structures , with major merging at high redshifts @xmath114 rapidly followed by coalescence of substructures , and accretion of small clumps at low @xmath115 , as noted by several authors ( e.g. , zhao , jing & brner 2003 ; diemand , kuhlen & madau 2007 ; homan et al .",

    "2.2.1 we adopted a scenario in which seed bhs are the end - product of very massive stars ( vms ) , formed by primordial gas due to molecular hydrogen cooling . in this context , the bh density is related to the density of the primordial stars formed in the early haloes .",
    "we calculated the vms number density by requiring that the number of lyman - werner ( lw ) photons per baryon emitted by primordial stars is sufficient to prevent h@xmath252 cooling ( and hence further star formation ) throughout the universe .",
    "this condition on the lw photon flux determines a minimum mass for the dm halo hosting the seed bh .",
    "therefore , in our approach , the parameters describing the bh seed population are : i ) the seed bh mass ( m@xmath253 ) , ii ) the redshift at which bh seeds are formed ( @xmath254 ) , and iii ) the minimum mass of the dm halo hosting the seed bh ( m@xmath255 ) ; iv ) the mass distribution of the dm haloes hosting the seeds at the initial time .",
    "the seed black hole mass depends on the mass of the vms .",
    "theoretical models of primordial star formation ( mckee & tan 2008 , see also bromm et al . 2009 and",
    "reference therein ) which take into account the possible feedback processes that operate during the formation of the protostar predict a final stellar mass in the range 60 - 300 m@xmath256 for reasonable values of the entropy and angular momentum of the pre - stellar gas .",
    "this implies a population of primordial bhs with masses m@xmath253 @xmath237 m@xmath257/2",

    "it is interesting to note that assuming a low massive bh seed increases significantly the number of dde models excluded by our method , while increasing m@xmath253 up to the maximal value allowed by theoretical models ( 150 m@xmath256 ) does not reduce the exclusion region significantly .",

    ", this implies that the cosmological constraints derived in the previous section are not very sensitive to an increase of the bh seed mass because in this region of the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane the increase of m@xmath253 is balanced by a small increment of @xmath2 .",
    "it is also to be noted that the exclusion regions mainly differ at large values of @xmath3 because the decrease of cosmic time and of growth factor with increasing @xmath2 are less prominent than at smaller values .    as for the uncertainties related to the formation redshift of seed bhs",

    "2009 and reference therein ) . in our fiducial model",
    "we set @xmath254=20 . assuming that bh seeds are formed at higher redshift would not change the cosmic density of seed bhs because it corresponds to populate lower mass haloes with vms for fixed lw photon flux ( for @xmath254=30 , m@xmath255 decreases by a factor of about 20 ) .",
    "in contrast , increasing the initial redshift affects the bh growth due to gas accretion .",

    "this validates our approach assuming that the initial redshift of seed bhs formation is the same for all the de cosmological models .",
    "the last parameter characterizing the bh seed population is the minimum mass of the host dm halo .",
    "this is derived by a condition on the critical lw background flux ( @xmath263 ) above which the h@xmath252 cooling is prevented .",
    "haiman , abel & rees ( 2000 ) calculated @xmath263 as a function of the halo virial temperature and collapse redshift .",
    "they found that the higher the collapse redshift or temperature , the higher the flux needs to be to prevent star formation . for haloes with @xmath264 k @xmath265k , and for 10@xmath26650 , they found values of the critical background flux in the range @xmath267=(10@xmath223 - 10@xmath268 ) photons per baryon , while for @xmath269k the value of the flux is irrelevant because at these high temperatures cooling from neutral h always dominates over h@xmath252 .",
    "we conservatively adopted the upper limit of the above uncertainty range for @xmath263 since lower values would yield even tighter constraints in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane .",
    "however , even such a limit may be prone to some uncertainty : in fact , the density profile of the gas cloud is crucial in determining @xmath263 , because the formation of h@xmath252 molecules can be enhanced by the accelerated chemistry inside the central , dense regions .",
    "in addition , a central condensation tends to make the clouds more self - shielding against the external uvb background , and helps to preserve the internal h@xmath252 molecules .",
    "the values of the critical flux mentioned above were obtained by haiman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) by assuming a truncated isothermal sphere density profile and by taking into account self - shielding due to both h and h@xmath252 . in principle",
    ", different gas density profiles and the self - shielding within haloes could alter the estimate of the critical flux .",
    "it is difficult to quantify these effects , doing this would require computing radiative transfer across individual gas clouds exposed by an external uvb background , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , in order to explore the possible impact of such uncertainties on the @xmath3-@xmath2 constraints we repeated our calculations ( for all the examined de models ) after increasing @xmath263 by a factor of 5 above the already conservative fiducial value .",
    "the increase of the threshold of the lw flux up to @xmath263=0.05 implies a lower minimum mass of the dm halo hosting primordial stars by about a factor of 2 .",
    "this results in a higher number density of seed bhs present at the initial redshift , and therefore a mild reduction of the de models excluded by our criterion ( see the solid line in the top - right panel of fig .",

    "the final source of uncertainty related to the dm haloes hosting the seed bhs at the initial time is the halo mass distribution . in our fiducial model we assumed a press & schecter form ( sect .",

    "such an evolution of the equation of state can be related to a class of dynamics of the de field @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the latter is given by the klein- gordon equation @xmath305 , where the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is positive and represents the contribution due to the steepness of the potential @xmath306 , while the second is negative and corresponds to the friction due to the hubble expansion .",
    "the coasting evolution @xmath307 corresponds to an unstable situation of perfect balance between friction and the potential terms , dividing the dynamics into a class of `` thawing '' solutions with @xmath308 and a class of `` freezing '' solutions with @xmath309 .",
    "the first corresponds to dynamics initially dominated by the friction term , with the field evolving away from a `` cosmological constant - like '' state , while the second to de fields decelerating as they evolve down their potential toward the minimum , since the forcing due to the steep slope of the potential dominates over the hubble drag at early times ; as the minimum is approached , the flatter shape of the potential leaves the hubble drag dominate the dynamics , effectively freezing the field .",
    "the coasting line @xmath307 separating the two behaviours corresponds to the condition @xmath310 linder ( 2006 ) ; thus the number density of high - redshift bhs has an impact in excluding a wide class of models with a `` freezing '' behaviour corresponding to initially steep potentials . indeed , sugra inspired models ( brax & martin 1999 ) , which are well fitted by @xmath248 and @xmath249 ( linder 2003 ) are also highly unfavoured due to the combination of our constraints with previous observational constraints , as results from of fig .",
    "the cosmological constraints we derived are based on the standard gravity theory , the same approach will be applied to modified gravity models ( e.g. the dvali , gabadadze , porrati 2000 model ) in the next future .",
    "note that the exclusion regions we derived in the @xmath46 plane are extremely conservative , since in our computation we maximized the effectiveness of all processes contributing to the growth of bhs .",
    "in particular the above constraints are derived assuming : i ) continuous bh accretion ( no time gap between successive accretion episodes ) ; ii ) accretion always at the maximal eddington limit ; iii ) bh merging immediately following the merging of their host dm haloes ; iv ) all baryons contained in the galaxy are available for bh accretion and no energy feedback balancing the gas cooling in dm haloes .",
    "such conditions are expected to be exceedingly restrictive , as we have shown in sect .",
    "4 using a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation models based on a physical description of bh accretion .",
    "the above conservative approach makes difficult to extend the present method to lower redshifts , since our maximal accretion assumptions extrapolated over a larger span of cosmic time would yield , for all plausible @xmath3-@xmath2 combinations , upper bounds largely exceeding the observed abundances , and thus ineffective for constraining dde models .",
    "conversely , our approach is even more effective if the upper bounds derived from eq . 3 could be compared with the measured abundances of qsos at higher redshifts @xmath311 . in this context , the discovery of three new quasars at @xmath3127 in the united kingdom infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , mortlock et al . 2011 ;",
    "venemans et al . in prep . ) indicate that the present approach will be able to provided even tighter constraints on dde models in the next future .",
