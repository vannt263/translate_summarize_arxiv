    "the expectation for the existence of supermassive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ) in galaxy nuclei is supported by two well - established properties of galaxies : ( 1 ) high spatial resolution observations of nearby galaxies have demonstrated that smbhs are ubiquitous in the centers of galaxy bulges @xcite with masses tightly correlated with the mass and structure of their host galaxies @xcite , and ( 2 ) galaxies in a @xmath5cdm universe build up their structure hierarchically through mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when two galaxies merge , their smbhs will sink to the center through dynamical friction and through three - body interactions with stars and viscous exchange of angular momentum with circumbinary gas form a gravitationally bound binary that eventually coalesces due to the radiation of gravitational waves ( gws ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent progress has been made in the detection of  dual active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , \" double active nuclei in assumed merged galaxy systems with kiloparsec - scale separations @xcite .",
    "these dual agns , while a product of a galaxy merger , are not yet gravitationally bound , and thus are not necessarily fated to coalesce . a true smbhb becomes gravitationally bound on the scale of parsecs , which , beyond our local group of galaxies , is well below the angular resolving power of the most powerful current , or even future , telescopes .",
    "however , several promising candidates have been identified indirectly via spectroscopy : quasars with offset and/or drifting broad - line peaks attributed to a broad - line region in orbit around an smbh s binary companion @xcite .",
    "however , alternative scenarios have been proposed that do not require an smbhb , including double - peaked lines from a single accretion disk @xcite .",
    "a promising observational signature of smbhbs is their variable accretion luminosity .",
    "one of the first sub - parsec smbhb candidates , oj287 , was identified by its variability behavior @xcite .",
    "oj287 is a quasar that demonstrates regular optical outbursts on a timescale of 12 yr that has been modeled as the result of a secondary smbh companion passing through the primary smbh s accretion disk @xcite .",
    "such a configuration should be rare since the secondary bh s orbital axis must be highly misaligned with the primary bh s accretion disk axis in order for it to pass through its disk .",
    "a more generic signature of an smbhb is likely to be related to accretion through its circumbinary disk .    in a gas - rich galaxy merger ,",
    "strong gravitational torques drive gas inward , triggering both star formation and bh accretion @xcite .",
    "in particular , hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary disks show that accretion via `` hot streams '' onto the bhs is strongly modulated by the binary s orbital motion for mass ratios of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "simulations @xcite also detect a @xmath7 @xmath8 timescale originating from a surface density `` lump '' just outside the central cavity of the circumbinary disk , which is a persistent but secularly evolving feature .",
    "while working on our paper , we became aware of the report of pg 1302 - 102 , a periodically variable quasar discovered by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is a @xmath9 magnitude quasar at @xmath10 , varying at the 0.14 mag level with a period of @xmath11 yr , with good sampling over 1.8 cycles and extended archival data going back 20 yr .",
    "their physical interpretation for its variability is an smbhb ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 pc ) , its luminosity being modulated due to either a precessing jet or an overdensity ( `` hot spot '' ) in the inner edge of its circumbinary disk .    in this letter",
    ", we present our most significant detection from the systematic search for periodically varying quasars in the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey ( ps1 mds ) field md09 .",
    "pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 is a radio - loud quasar at @xmath0 with archival spectroscopy from fqbs and extended baseline photometry from crts .",
    "the 8.5 yr baseline of the ps1+crts light curve is well described by a simple sinusoid , consistent with theoretical simulations for the modulated accretion rate in a @xmath14 mass - ratio smbhb .",
    "we use the rest - frame period and virial black hole mass estimate to infer an orbital separation of the binary that is in the gw - driven regime .",
    "the dynamics of a gravitationally bound smbhb system can be described by kepler s third law :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the separation between the bhs ; and @xmath19 is the total mass of the system .",
    "@xcite calculate the minimum survey area to detect a statistically significant sample of quasars powered by smbhbs as a function of variable magnitude depth , assuming reasonable values for the quasar luminosity function , quasar lifetime ( @xmath20 yr ) , the eddington fraction ( @xmath21 ) , and the fractional variability amplitude ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the variability detection threshold we have achieved in md09 (  [ sec_ensemble ] ) corresponds to a @xmath23 sensitivity for point sources brighter than @xmath24 mag , and thus a variable magnitude of 23.5 mag . at this depth , @xcite require an area of @xmath25100 deg@xmath26 to yield a sample of over 100 smbhbs ; an excellent match to the area of ps1 mds ( 80 deg@xmath26 ) .",
    "furthermore , the baseline ( 4.2 yr ) and cadence ( 3 days ) of ps1 mds make us sensitive to timescales for which bhs ( with @xmath27 ) are in the gw - driven regime of orbital decay .",
    "the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) is a wide - field imaging system designed for dedicated survey observations on a 1.8 m telescope on haleakala , hawaii , with a 1.4 gigapixel camera and a 7 deg@xmath28 field of view @xcite .",
    "the ps1 telescope is operated by the institute for astronomy ( ifa ) at the university of hawaii and has just completed over @xmath29 yr of operation in 2014 march .",
    "we present data from the medium deep survey ( mds ) , a deep , multi - epoch survey of @xmath30 circular fields distributed across the sky , each @xmath31 deg@xmath28 in size , whose daily observing cadence in five filters is excellent for studying persistent variable sources , including quasars .",
    "the ps1 mds cadence of observation cycles through the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35  bands every three nights , with observations in the @xmath36  band close to the full moon . due to the poorer time sampling of the @xmath36 observations , we do not use them in this analysis .",
    "we began our systematic search for smbhb candidates among color - selected quasars in the ps1 md09 field .",
    "this is the first md field that was made available to the ps1 science collaboration in the pan - starrs science interface ( psi ) online database . in order to maximize our sensitivity to intrinsic variability",
    ", we first applied the technique of differential ensemble photometry .",
    "this technique is able to correct for local systematic errors due to variable atmospheric conditions by comparing a target object with nearby non - variable stars @xcite .",
    "we created a color - selected reference star sample and quasar sample by cross - matching point sources ( @xmath37 mag ) in the md09 field with a custom catalog extracted from full - survey deep stacks from ps1 mds in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36  bands , as well as from observations with the canada ",
    "hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in the @xmath38 band ( s. heinis et al . 2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "we converted all magnitudes to the sdss photometric system @xcite to take advantage of the sdss color selection of stars and quasars already available in the literature @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : colors ] shows the color - color diagrams of the point sources in md09 selected as quasars and non - variable stars .",
    "this query resulted in 8158 reference stars and 316 quasars , each with an average of 350 detections in four filters .",
    "we modified the ensemble photometry software developed by @xcite for sdss to the ps1 data format and ran it on the reference stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : colors ] ( bottom right panel ) , we plot the `` corrected '' magnitude error as a function of mean magnitude compared with the `` raw '' values before ensemble photometry .",
    "the ensemble photometry reduces the measured errors significantly , lowering the error floor from 0.045 to 0.025 mag , and resulting in a 2@xmath39 variability threshold of @xmath40 mag on the bright end to 0.34 mag on the faint end .",
    "we then applied ensemble photometry to the 316 color - selected quasars and flagged quasars as variable based on their magnitude error relative to their neighbors of a similar brightness ; we set @xmath41 as our criterion for variability and required a variability flag in at least two filters .",
    "this selection yielded @xmath42 variable quasars in md09 . among these color - selected variable quasars ,",
    "we searched for potential periodic signatures using the lomb  scargle ( ls ) periodogram , a fourier analysis technique of unevenly spaced data with noise @xcite . for @xmath43 data points in the time series spanning a total length of @xmath44 in units of mjd , we sampled the periodogram at the number of recommended independent frequencies ( @xmath45 ) , from @xcite , from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ( which would be the nyquist frequency if data were evenly sampled ) , resulting in a frequency resolution in the periodogram of @xmath48 d@xmath49 .",
    "when identifying periodic sources , we took advantage of the redundancy of ps1 mds monitoring in four filters ( @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 ) , each with a slightly different observing cadence due to weather and scheduling constraints to help filter out false detections from aliasing by requiring that periodogram peaks be coherent across multiple filters ; @xmath50 of the @xmath42 variable quasars survived this test .",
    "among the candidate periodic quasars from our periodogram analysis , here we focus on our most significant detection , pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 ( j2000 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ps1_pgrams ] , we show its periodogram in four ps1 filters , with the strongest peak marked with a dashed line .",
    "we fold each filter light curve on this period ( figure [ fig : fit_3783 ] ) , and measure the scatter of the residuals from the best - fit sine curve ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the error of the periodogram peak frequency ( @xmath52 ) and the signal - to - noise ratio of the peak power ( @xmath53 ) can then be calculated from @xmath51 and the amplitude of the signal @xmath54 @xcite as @xmath55 ( which gives us an error on the detected period of @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the resulting average period across all four filters is @xmath58 days , with the highest signal - to - noise ratio in the @xmath32  filter with @xmath59 , and periodogram peaks in all four filters well above a @xmath60 false - alarm probability ( corresponding to 10@xmath39 ) plotted with a dotted line in figure [ fig : ps1_pgrams ] .",
    "the ps1 data cover 2.6 cycles , just shy of the  rule of thumb \" number of cycles ( three ) for a periodic variation to be apparent to the eye @xcite . from our monte carlo simulations of @xmath61 stochastic",
    "damped random walk @xcite light curves , we find a false periodic detection rate of @xmath62 using our selection criteria from  5 .",
    "we further disfavor a false alarm from stochastic quasar variability since the @xmath63 of the simulations that successfully mimic the periodic timescale of our candidate have short - timescale variances a factor of @xmath64 larger than expected for the quasar s luminosity and inferred black hole mass (  7 ) .",
    "note that there is a secondary peak in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 periodograms that , if real and not an artifact from the ps1 data sampling , is at twice the primary peak frequency , a signature of @xmath14 mass - ratio smbhbs , which show an accretion rate modulation most closely described by a simple sinusoid @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 s sinusoidal modulation increases with decreasing wavelength , consistent with the exponential dependence on wavelength found in previous quasar variability studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 is a radio - loud quasar ( fbqs j221648.7 + 012427 ) with an archival spectrum from the first bright quasar survey @xcite .",
    "we are also fortunate that this candidate has an archival v - band light curve from crts @xcite , which we use to test the persistence of the periodic variation over an extended baseline of 8.5 yr ( corresponding to 5.7 cycles ) . to compare to the crts light curve , we convert the ps1 @xmath32-band light curves to the sdss system @xcite and then to the johnson @xmath65 magnitude using the photometric transformation for quasars from @xcite and an average @xmath32-@xmath66 mag .",
    "we had to apply an additional offset of @xmath67 mag to the pseudo-@xmath65 ps1 magnitudes in order to match the average of the crts @xmath65-band data .",
    "though the photometric errors are relatively large , the crts measurements are consistent with those of ps1 during their overlap ( figure [ fig : crts_3783 ] ) , and have residuals over the entire crts baseline from the ps1-fitted sinusoidal model that are gaussian with a @xmath68 mag that is comparable to the mean photometric error of 0.18 mag .",
    "we use the width of the quasar s @xmath69 iv line and its nearby continuum luminosity to make a virial estimate of the black hole mass from @xcite :    @xmath70 + 6.66      \\label{eqn : vestergaard}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71   .",
    "the fbqs spectrum , though not publicly available in an electronic format , was measured with a ruler to determine @xmath72(1350  ( 1+z ) ) @xmath73 ergs s@xmath49@xmath74 @xmath49 , and fwhm ( civ @xmath75 ) @xmath76  .",
    "the civ line is symmetric in shape , and its width corresponds to a velocity in the rest - frame of @xmath77 km s@xmath49 .",
    "we correct for a galactic extinction of @xmath78 mag @xcite , using the extinction law from @xcite , to find @xmath79 erg s@xmath49@xmath49 , where @xmath80 is the luminosity distance assuming @xmath81 km / s / mpc , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "this results in a black hole mass of @xmath86 , with a scatter from the uncertainty in the relation of 0.5dex . applying a mean quasar bolometric correction at @xmath87  of bc=@xmath88 from @xcite ,",
    "one gets a bolometric luminosity of @xmath89 erg s@xmath49 .",
    "note that this object is also radio loud , with a radio luminosity at the rest - frame frequency of 5 ghz of @xmath90(erg s@xmath49 ) ) = 32.8 from @xcite .    assuming the rest - frame period @xmath91 is on the order of the orbital timescale of the smbhb , with a caveat that in addition to a strong dependence on mass ratio , there are a range of theoretical predictions for translating @xmath92 to @xmath8 ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we then calculate the orbital separation of the binary to be @xmath93 ( @xmath4 pc ) , securely placing it in the gravitationally bound regime of a physically viable smbhb system  a circumbinary accretion disk system capable of maintaining a central cavity , stable to gravitational fragmentation , and in the regime of orbital decay driven by gws ( @xcite ) .",
    "also note that since the viscous time scales as @xmath94 , one could expect to be able to detect modulations in the accretion rate fed by the streams in the circumbinary disk cavity , without being washed out by viscous processes in the `` mini disks '' around each bh @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the rest - frame inspiral time for the binary is @xmath95 for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , opening up the possibility for detecting the decay of the orbital period @xmath98 with future monitoring , as well as providing a promising target for direct gw detection for pulsar timing arrays @xcite .",

    "the redshift of this smbhb candidate coincides with the peak epoch for smbhb mergers @xcite , and its large mass ( @xmath100 ) makes it favorable for detection in the gw - driven regime , due to the strong dependence on @xmath19 of the residence time at a given orbital separation in units of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "like the crts smbhb candidate pg 1302 - 102 reported by @xcite , our smbhb candidate is also a radio - loud quasar .",
    "however , given the shorter rest - frame period of our candidate of 0.5 yr ( versus 4 yr in pg 1302 - 102 ) , it is even more unlikely for its variability to be driven by jet precession , either originating from a single smbh @xcite or a binary smbh @xcite .",
