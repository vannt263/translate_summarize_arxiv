    "<S> similar difficulties in the level orderings appear for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances , which have led to the speculation that the roper resonance may be more appropriately viewed as a hybrid baryon state with explicitly excited gluon field configurations  @xcite , or as a breathing mode of the ground state  @xcite or states which can be described in terms of meson - baryon dynamics alone  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite it was shown that one can not isolate a low - lying excited eigenstate using a single fixed - size source smearing . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of states manifested itself as a smearing dependence of the effective mass . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this sensitivity to isolate the energy eigenstates .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , we show the mass from the projected correlation functions and from the eigenvalues ( as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) for the fourth combination ( 3,12,26,35 ) of @xmath39 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar results in mass from the projected correlation functions and the eigenvalues are observed in this analysis as in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though the mass of the first excited state from projected correlation functions show little change with variational parameters , see fig.[fig : mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , the second and third excited states start a little below which indicates @xmath17 and @xmath20 are not sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> with larger euclidean times fewer states will contribute significantly to the correlators . </S>",
    "<S> the robust aspect of fitting projected correlators is manifest in fig.[fig : mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , and reflects the stability of the eigenvectors against changes in @xmath17 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the mass from the eigenvalue analysis shows significant dependence on the variational parameters . the same method as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is applied in this letter to extract the mass from the projected correlation functions .    in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] , masses extracted from all the combinations of @xmath39 matrices ( from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) are shown for the pion mass of 797 mev . some dependence of the excited states on smearing count is also observed here as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a few of the interpolator basis smearing sets . </S>",
    "<S> however the ground and first excited states are robust against changes in the interpolator basis , providing evidence that an energy eigenstate has been isolated . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the highest excited state ( the third excited state ) is influenced more by the level of smearing than the lower excited states . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected as this state must accommodate all remaining spectral strength .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath44 combination in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] provides heavier excited states as this basis begins with a low number of smearing sweeps ( a sweep count of 1 ) and also contains another low smearing set of 7 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third excited states , and more importantly , the first excited state sits a bit high in comparison with the other bases . </S>",
    "<S> hence , extracting masses with this basis is not as reliable as other sets . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 combination also contains elements with a small smearing sweep count ( 3 and 7 ) , hence this basis also provides heavier excited states and shows some systematic drift in the second excited state . however , this basis has reduced contamination from the excited states when compared with the first basis . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath46 combination also starts at the low smearing count , so the mass from this basis for the third excited state is a little high .    </S>",
    "<S> we can observe at this point that including basis elements with a low smearing count will increase the masses of excited states ( for instance , consecutive low numbers of smearing sweeps 1,7 and 3,7 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the correlation functions with these low sweep counts have a large overlap with several heavier excited states in their sub - leading exponential . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the inclusion of basis elements with a high level of smearing ( for instance , a sweep count of 48 ) results in larger statistical errors in the analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 combination starts from a moderate smearing sweep count ( 12 ) and also contains elements with consecutive smearing sweep counts which provides less diversity in the basis . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath48 combination contains consecutive large smearing sweep counts of 35 and 48 and operators for these levels of smearing are very similar challenging the isolation of single energy eigenstates .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath49 and @xmath50 combinations are well spread over the given range of smearing sweeps and start from a sweep count of 3 . </S>",
    "<S> they do nt include successive lower smearing sweep counts . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 combination contains the basis element with a sweep count of 48 but has only slightly larger statistical errors than the @xmath49 basis choice . </S>",
    "<S> both these bases provide diversity . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that both combinations provide consistent results for the states . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it should be noted that the @xmath46 to @xmath52 combinations all provide very consistent results for the lower three ( ground , first and second ) energy states , shown in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath45 and the @xmath53 excited states display some evidence of eigenstate mixing , the ground and the @xmath42 excited states are robust in this analysis as they agree within one standard deviation for all the combinations of @xmath39 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> hence , an analysis is performed to calculate the systematic errors associated with the choice of basis over the preferred four combinations ( from @xmath46 to @xmath52 ) with @xmath54 , where , @xmath55 is the number of bases , in this case is equal to 4 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that for the ground and first excited states the systematic errors associated with choice of basis are very small in comparison with their statistical errors ( see table [ table : table.mpi.mavg.err - sum - over - qudrature.4comb.4states ] ) .            in fig.[fig </S>",
    "<S> : paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.4states.allq.new ] , the masses from projected correlation functions are shown for all pion masses averaged over four combinations of correlation matrices ( from @xmath46 to @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> masses are averaged over these four bases and errors ( average statistical errors over these four bases and systematic errors associated with basis choices ) are combined in quadrature , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> eigenstate mixing may be affecting the results for the second and the third excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the ground and the @xmath44 excited states systematically approach the physical mass of the nucleon and roper state . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time evidence of a low - lying roper state has appeared from variational analysis near the chiral regime .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.2states.allq.new ] , the ground and the first excited states of fig.[fig : paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.4states.allq.new ] are shown in larger scale for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the non - interacting two particle p - wave @xmath57 is shown by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the observed lattice roper state sits lower than the p - wave @xmath57 , indicative of attractive @xmath58 interactions producing a resonance at physical quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> the very consistent euclidean - time fit window for all the bases and for all the quark masses , noticeably the lower time of the fit as shown in table [ table : mass_roperstates_4combs ] , assist to identify the robust nature of the extracted roper state which comes at the same euclidean - time from the heaviest to the lightest quarks masses .    </S>",
    "<S> there are quenched artifacts that will have significant influence on our results should we progress to lighter quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> not only are @xmath59 couplings different in quenched qcd , but there are also contributions from unphysical , degenerate p - wave @xmath60 two - particle states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future calculations approaching the decay threshold should be done in full dynamical - fermion qcd .    in conclusion , through the use of a variety of smeared - smeared correlation functions in constructing the correlation matrix , the first positive parity excited state of the nucleon @xmath0 , the roper state , has been observed for the first time using the variational analysis . while the @xmath61 correlation matrix analysis of standard interpolators is insufficient to isolate these excited energy eigenstates of qcd  @xcite , using the new correlation matrix construction with smeared - smeared correlators </S>",
    "<S> enables us to extract the otherwise elusive roper state . </S>"
