    "the rock experiments of sliding friction are understood by the so - called rate- and state - dependent friction laws .",
    "the equations of this laws unify the results obtained from two types of rock experiments ; the first one is the time dependence of static coefficient of friction @xcite and the second one is slip velocity dependence of the dynamic coefficient of friction @xcite .",
    "the properties of dynamic friction are the following @xcite :    1 .",
    "frictional coefficient in stable sliding conditions with a constant load - point velocity depends on the logarithm of the load - point velocity ; 2 .",
    "the magnitude of the instantaneous jump of the frictional coefficient depends on the change of the logarithm of the quotient of the corresponding load - point velocities ; 3 .",
    "the following evolution of the frictional coefficient to new value in stable sliding is also dependent on the instantaneous change of the load - point velocity ; 4 .",
    "oscillation occurs in some cases ( e.g. , large load - point velocity , polished surfaces , thin sand interface layer between the samples ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    in healing experiments the properties of static friction are :    1 .",
    "recovery magnitude is proportional to the logarithm of healing time ; 2 .",
    "larger velocity or larger elasticity increases the recovery magnitude of the static friction ;    these properties can be reproduced by using two classical equations .",
    "the first one is the _ constitutive law _ , expressing the relation between frictional coefficient @xmath0 and slip velocity @xmath1 with an additional variable , called state variable @xmath2 .",
    "the second one is the _ evolution law _ expressing the time evolution of state variable depending on the slip velocity @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the shear stress , @xmath5 is the normal stress , @xmath6 is the constant frictional coefficient for steady - state slip at reference slip velocity @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are material parameters , @xmath10 is the critical slip distance , and @xmath11 is time .",
    "an important improvement is the evolution equation of ruina @xcite .",
    "experimental data of static friction is better reproduced by the equations of the dieterich - law @xcite ( eqs . and ) , and of dynamic friction by the equations of ruina - law @xcite ( eqs . and ) . a comparison with experimental data",
    "is given in the works @xcite .",
    "in particular the dieterich - law assumes time - relaxation and therefore it is asymmetric for upward and downward jumps in displacement , contrary to the experiments . on the other hand the experimentally observed time",
    "dependent healing is properly reproduced by the dieterich - law and does not reproduced by the ruina - law .",
    "thus another versions have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) in order to reproduce the experimental data better . however , none of them are completely satisfactory .",
    "nakatani reformulated the dieterich - ruina law introducing a new variable @xcite :    then the constitutive law is linearized with this variable : and the evolution laws of dieterich and ruina become respectively .",
    "nakatani suggested this modification together with a particular interpretation of the new variable as strength and interpreted the modified evolution equation of dieterich in the framework of thermal activation theory .",
    "he did not investigate the modified form of ruina law .",
    "a thermodynamic approach of mitsui and vn introduced a minimal model of rock friction by using permanent and recoverable parts of the total observed displacement as state variables in the spirit of continuum plasticity @xcite .",
    "they interpreted the state variable of the rate- and state dependent friction law as the elastic part of the displacement .",
    "it was argued that the common origin of the constitutive and the evolution laws is originated in a thermodynamic framework .",
    "their calculation of the entropy production was the following .",
    "the general setting is a sliding body on a horizontal surface with mass @xmath12 .",
    "there are two forces that determine the motion of the body : the external force @xmath13 , and the damping force @xmath14 , due to friction ( fig . ) .",
    "the position of the body is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the body is not considered completely rigid , however one assumes that one particular material point of the body characterize its instantaneous position .",
    "the equation of motion is     sliding thermomechanical body , width=415,height=302 ]    moreover , the work of the external force changes the energy of the body , @xmath16 .",
    "therefore    in this case thermodynamics requires that the damping force contributes only to the internal energy of the body .",
    "it is assumed that the external force accelerates the body and also that the body is deformable . in this homogeneous model ,",
    "the deformation is expressed by the recoverable displacement , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the kinetic and and elastic energies of the body are distinguished .",
    "this particular interpretation from @xcite is not necessary , @xmath18 may denote a general internal variable .",
    "the internal energy , @xmath19 , is the difference of the total energy , @xmath16 , the kinetic energy and a quadratic contribution of the internal variable .",
    "this form follows from the condition of thermodynamic stability in the state space @xcite . where @xmath20 is a parameter like in elasticity .",
    "one assumes a particular kinematic condition in order to introduce an interpretation of @xmath18 .",
    "when the instantaneous position of the body is the sum of a permanent and a recoverable displacements then a convenient method of their distinction is an additive separation of the displacement rates : where @xmath1 is the rate of the position @xmath15 , and @xmath21 is the rate of the permanent displacement .",
    "this rate type kinematical condition is convenient when distinguishing permanent and recoverable changes .",
    "is analogous to the condition used in plasticity for the distinction of plastic and elastic strains ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in friction the internal variable is not necessarily identical to the recoverable strain .",
    "the dissipation can be calculated by the entropy balance , assuming that the entropy is the function of the internal energy only :    the damping force and also the rate of the internal variable @xmath22 are the constitutive quantities to be determined in accordance with the requirement of nonnegative entropy production .",
    "we connect the first term to friction interaction and the second term to frictional healing . in the vicinity of thermodynamic equilibrium , where both forces and fluxes are zero , the usual linear relationship is a consequence of lagrange s mean value theorem @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath17 are thermodynamic state variables , therefore they can be considered as thermodynamic forces , while @xmath0 and @xmath23 are to be determined constitutively , they are thermodynamic fluxes",
    ". the standard linear approximation results in equations that reflect well the thermodynamic admissibility of both velocity weakening and strengthening , however , did not incorporate the observed direct effect ( logarithmic relaxation ) @xcite .",
    "however , in velocity - step experiments dynamic friction is a steady state phenomenon , we are looking for a deviation of the frictional coefficient from a fixed value , @xmath24 , at a given @xmath25 reference velocity . on the other hand the internal variable",
    "is expected to be zero , when its time derivative is zero , in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ". therefore we face to a mixed , partial steady state , partial equilibrium situation",
    ". however , the dissipation inequality may not characterize the deviation from steady state .",
    "what we need is an estimation of the deviation of the entropy production .    in our framework",
    "the steady state means a constant displacement rate , denoted by @xmath25 . therefore the internal energy should be determined accordingly where @xmath26 is the energy of the body moving with the veolcity @xmath25 .",
    "then the calculation of the entropy production results in    we can introduce a friction specific entropy production with amonton s law : where @xmath27 is the external shear stress divided by the normal force , @xmath28 is the frictional stress divided by the normal force and @xmath29 .",
    "now , it is straightforward to introduce a linear approximation for the increment of entropy production , as for the near equilibrium situation .",
    "however , in the following we apply a different starting point .",
    "our fundamental assumption is that the leading term of the deviation from the steady state is _ logarithmic _ , while it is linear around equilibrium .",
    "we can formulate this hypothesis analogously to the classical exploitation of the entropy principle introducing the concept of _ incremental entropy production_. we require that it is minimal at the steady state we will call this hypothesis _ the principle of minimal incremental entropy production_.    the required minimality ensures the asymptotic stability of the steady state if the evolution equations are constructed accordingly . in this respect",
    "the principle is similar to the role of the second law near to the equilibrium . on the other hand",
    "this hypothesis is a modification of the requirement of nonnegative excess entropy production of glansdorff and prigogine @xcite .",
    "the difference of the prigogine - glansdorff requirement is the logarithmic deviation instead of a linear one .",
    "( the possibility of partial steady state , a specific property of friction , is important , too ) .",
    "along with them we want to emphasize that the inequality here is not a law of nature , it is regarded as a convenient stability assumption @xcite .",
    "an example of similar logarithmic deviation is the thermodynamics of chemical kinetics , where the entropy production is a product of the chemical affinity and the reaction rate , but the guldberg - waage kinetic equations introduce an exponential relation @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that chemical equilibrium is considered as a steady state from a thermodynamic point of view , when forward and backward reactions are properly distinguished @xcite .",
    "our formula corresponds a simple monomolecular reaction , which is actually equivalent to a single internal degree of freedom @xcite . in friction",
    "the logarithmic deviation may be further motivated according to this chemical analogy @xcite .",
    "finally we remark , that the logarithmic form can be directly derived assuming that the internal energy is modified by a logarithmic velocity dependent term instead of a quadratic one @xmath30 .",
    "is similar to the usual entropy production in many respect .",
    "first of all the two terms are zero in the reference steady state and we assume that @xmath31 is a constitutive function of the logarithmic deviation , a function of the thermodynamic state variable .",
    "therefore , in case of smooth functions the lagrange mean value theorem ensures a linear homogeneous relationship between these constitutive quantities and the related thermodynamic forces also in this mixed steady - state equilibrium case .",
    "the linearization of result in the following expression :    we will call - as _ thermodynamical aging law_. is identical to the nakatani form of the constitutive law and is similar to .    the coefficient matrix may depend on the thermodynamic forces , in particular @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 may depend on the state variables @xmath1 and @xmath17 @xcite . in the following we assume a strict linear relationship , when the coefficient matrix is constant .",
    "it is remarkable , that there are no reasons to assume symmetry or antisymmetry of the matrix .",
    "the conditions of onsagerian statistical background can not be introduced without a particular interpretation of the internal variable ( more detailed arguments are given in @xcite .",
    "according to the experimental observations in case of velocity step and healing experiments , sometimes the internal variable changes when the surfaces slip , and sometimes its evolution is seemingly independent of the relative motion of the surfaces .",
    "this distinction is connected to the detailed mechanism of friction , and requires an extension of the modeling framework . in the following",
    "we will investigate the question of slip related internal variable evolution .",
    "ruina @xcite applied this assumption directly to the relaxation . in our case that requires the modification of , assuming that the slip is what makes change of the internal variable and the rate of the variable is a consequence . in this case the time derivative in is substituted by the space derivative and the rate is obtained as a consequence : performing this substitution in leads to this equation , together with will be called _ thermodynamical slip law_. one can see , that the nakatani transformed ruina - law , can be obtained if @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the number of phenomenological parameters is increased by one , from three to four , compared to the original ruina theory .",
    "it is because @xmath40 appears only as a multiplier of the cross coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the slip governed modification represents a particular quasilinear form of the strictly linear relations of the thermodynamic aging law -.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    the slip condition of ruina , expressed by assumes that @xmath1 is the relative surface velocity , related to the permanent part of the displacement . when introducing a distinction between a permanent and a recoverable parts of the apparent displacement beyond the difference of the load point an relative surface velocities , one may expect , that only the permanent part contributes to the entropy production , to the evolution of the internal variable .",
    "for example an interpretation of the internal variable as recoverable displacement with the condition leads to the following permanent displacement : @xmath41    particular mechanisms require that the internal variable influences the slip .",
    "for example when the internal variable is connected to deformation of surface irregularities , then this conclusion is straightforward . therefore we assume in general , that the internal variable directly influences the displacement and the reduced part is what influences the ( incremental ) entropy production .",
    "hence we introduce @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the _ factor of slip reduction_. if @xmath44 , then the internal variable can be interpreted as the recoverable part of the displacement @xcite .",
    "therefore the evolution equation of the internal variable is obtained by substituting the time derivative with the slip related change of the internal variable , as follows : @xmath45 for the sake of simplicity @xmath46 is constant .",
    "then a simple rearrangement leads to the following evolution equation of the internal variable :    together with we will call this equation _ thermodynamical friction law_. this is an other particular quasilinear form of the thermodynamic aging law - .    in the above thermodynamical models",
    "there is a direct effect and the conventional step test parameters are @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the following",
    "we compare the performance of the obtained thermodynamic models with the classical models and experiments .",
    "a comparison of the different rate- and state dependent friction laws is shown in figure [ velojump_uni ] .",
    "the velocity weakening experiment is modeled with the following parameters :    @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "dieterich and ruina models shown by a solid thin lines .",
    "the parameters of the thermodynamic friction model are calibrated to give the proper step conditions and relaxation speed : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "there are two additional parameters , the static recovery strength @xmath40 , analogous to a spring constant , and the factor of slip reduction @xmath46 .",
    "the dotted curve runs exactly over the line obtained by the ruina model , because thermodynamic slip model recovers the ruina case when @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "one obtains highly asymmetric relaxation curves choosing higher values of the slip reduction parameter @xmath46 and with a proper choice one calculates curves that run close are pretty close to the dieterich model .",
    "e.g. the thick dashed curve was calculated with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , one can obtain symmetric relaxation curves close to either the down or up relaxation curves of the dieterich model with an appropriate choice of the parameters .",
    "for example the thick dotdashed line was calculated using @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the thermodynamic aging law produces asymmetric curves , similar to the dieterich law .",

    "the interpretation of healing is contradictory , therefore we have chosen the experiments and strategy of beeler an tullis @xcite for demonstration .",
    "they performed healing experiments with different machine rigidity .",
    "one of them @xmath65 was the natural elasticity of the experimental device , in this case the load point velocity was @xmath66 . with the @xmath67 servocontrolled value the load point velocity was @xmath68 .",
