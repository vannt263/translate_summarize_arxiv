    "since @xmath23 takes characteristic lines into characteristic lines , @xmath126 is a rectangle with three vertices on three of the @xmath127-coordinate rays .",
    "thus the fourth vertex of @xmath126 is on the other coordinate ray .",

    "the four curvilinear rays @xmath62 emanating from the origin can be described by means of four increasing bijections of @xmath133 .",
    "this can be done in two ways : using the _ positive and negative parts _ of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath142 or cyclically , by using four functions @xmath143 that express the curves @xmath62 in characteristic coordinates : @xmath144 the functions @xmath25 are determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 through the map @xmath145 which shows that they satisfy the cyclic condition @xmath146 in fact , this is exactly the solvability condition for equations  ( [ ghkmap ] ) . to wit : given  @xmath25 ( @xmath147 ) , one can solve for three of the functions @xmath148 in terms of any one of them , say @xmath149 , by using the last three coordinates of  ( [ ghkmap ] ) : @xmath150 the first coordinate of  ( [ ghkmap ] ) is @xmath151 , or @xmath152 and is satisfied under condition ( [ cyclic1 ] ) .",
