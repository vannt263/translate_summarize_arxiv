    "the electroexcitation of a nucleon resonance is described by two transverse form factors , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and one longitudinal or scalar form factor , @xmath25 , where the subscript denotes the projection of the resonance spin upon the virtual photon momentum and the dependence upon photon virtuality , @xmath26 , describes the spatial structure of the transition .",
    "measurement of all three transition form factors could provide stimulating tests of qcd - inspired models of baryon structure @xcite .",
    "for example , one might be able to determine the admixtures of small components with mixed symmetry or orbital excitation into wave functions dominated by @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "alternatively , it has been speculated that the roper resonance at 1440 mev could be a hybrid baryon based upon gluonic excitation @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic transition form factors would be distinctly different for a hybrid baryon or for a radial single - quark excitation @xcite .",
    "however , the electroexcitation of a resonance , @xmath28 , by a virtual photon , @xmath29 , in a reaction of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 could be one or even several mesons , inevitably is accompanied by nonresonant contributions and is complicated by final - state interactions .",
    "furthermore , the nucleon resonances are broad and overlapping .",
    "therefore , measurements of differential cross sections alone are not sufficient to permit clean , model - independent determination of the multipole amplitudes for meson electroproduction or , ultimately , the transition form factors .",
    "there has been long - standing interest in deformed components of the @xmath32 and @xmath4 wave functions @xcite .",
    "the dominant amplitude for pion electroproduction at the @xmath4 resonance is the @xmath33 amplitude , but smaller @xmath34 and @xmath35 amplitudes arise from configuration mixing within the quark core @xcite , often described as quadrupole deformation , or from meson and gluon exchange currents between quarks @xcite , or coupling to the pion cloud outside the quark core @xcite .",
    "thus , the quadrupole deformation is related to the ratios of isospin-3/2 electroproduction multipole amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 evaluated at @xmath38 where @xmath39 gev is the physical mass .",
    "these quantities are often labelled as emr and smr instead and we will use both notations interchangeably .",
    "it has been argued that the intrinsic @xmath32 and @xmath4 quadrupole moments are small @xcite and that the observed emr and smr are dominated by nonvalence degrees of freedom .",
    "most previous determinations of emr and smr analyzed differential cross section data using legendre expansions truncated according to the assumption of @xmath33 dominance . the data prior to 1990 generally suffered from poor statistics , limited acceptance , and relatively large systematic uncertainties , leaving even the sign of emr at low @xmath26 undetermined @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments using polarized photons @xcite now find @xmath40 at @xmath41 with relatively little model dependence @xcite .",
    "similarly , recoil polarization for parallel kinematics gave @xmath42 for @xmath43 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using more precise measurements of the azimuthal dependence of the differential cross section give @xmath44 at @xmath45 @xcite and have mapped the @xmath26 dependence up to 4 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 @xcite , but these analyses still rely upon @xmath33 dominance",
    ". however , there are several indications that this truncation may be inadequate .",
    "first , at @xmath46 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 there is a strong disagreement between the the smr value obtained at bonn @xcite detecting a forward pion and those obtained at mit - bates @xcite and mainz @xcite detecting a forward proton that might be explained by an unexpectedly large @xmath47 amplitude @xcite .",
    "second , the dynamical models fail to reproduce the induced polarization for parallel kinematics at @xmath48 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 where the pion cloud is important @xcite .",
    "similar problems have also been observed at @xmath49 and 0.65 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "third , it appears to be difficult to obtain a consistent description of the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal - transverse interference for @xmath50 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 and @xmath51 gev where one might expect @xmath33 dominance to suffice @xcite , but a multipole analysis is not possible without more complete angular coverage and sensitivity to phases .    in principle , this model dependence can be reduced considerably by measurement of recoil and/or target polarization observables that are sensitive to the relative phase between resonant and nonresonant mechanisms @xcite .",
    "polarization often enhances the sensitivity to small amplitudes by interference with a large amplitude .",
    "helicity - dependent recoil polarization is sensitive to real parts and helicity - independent recoil polarization is sensitive to imaginary parts of products of multipole amplitudes . furthermore , by measuring the azimuthal dependencies one can determine response functions sensitive to the linear polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "thus , it may be possible to perform a nearly model - independent multipole analysis if complete angular distributions are measured for a comprehensive set of recoil - polarization observables .",
    "these multipole amplitudes can then be interpreted with the aid of dynamical or coupled - channels models that enforce unitary and relate the complex multipole amplitude to the real transition form factor .",
    "note that coarsely binned measurements of asymmetries with respect to longitudinal target polarization have been made recently by biselli _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the @xmath13 channel and by de vita _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the @xmath52 channel in the resonance region with @xmath53 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 .",
    "however , those data have not been resolved into response functions and are not suitable for detailed multipole analysis .    in this paper",
    "we report the first extensive measurements of angular distributions for recoil polarization in pion electroproduction .",
    "we have measured recoil polarization response functions for the @xmath54 reaction at @xmath55 ( gev/@xmath1)@xmath2 near the @xmath4 resonance , obtaining angular distributions for a total of 16 independent response functions in 10 steps of @xmath9 covering @xmath3 gev ; the angular coverage and statistical precision are best in the central region , @xmath56 gev .",
    "the data for @xmath57 gev were reported in ref .",
    "twelve of these response functions are observed here for the first time .",
    "we compare a traditional truncated legendre analysis with a more general multipole analysis of these data .",
    "although the two analyses are qualitatively consistent , the multipole analysis shows that truncation errors in the traditional legendre analysis of the quadrupole ratios are not negligible .",
    "furthermore , we find that excitation of the roper resonance is dominantly longitudinal .    section [ sec : rsfns ] defines the response functions , sec .",
