    "+ since the time gromov established the celebrated symplectic non - squeezing theorem , there have been attempts to find its analogue in contact topology . the problem is , as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , that the size of an open domain in a contact manifold can not be recognized by contact embeddings .",
    "this is due to the conformal nature of contact structures .",
    "consider the standard contact euclidean space @xmath8 , the scaling map @xmath9 is a contactomorphism that squeezes any domain into a small neighborhood of the origin when the factor @xmath10 is taken small enough . to avoid the scaling effect ,",
    "one considers the _ prequantization space _ of @xmath2 , that is @xmath3 where @xmath11 , with the contact form @xmath12 .",
    "the contact ball of radius @xmath1 is by definition the open domain @xmath6 .",
    "however , this is still not satisfactory .",
    "let @xmath13 . pick a positive integer @xmath14 and define functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 by formulas @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then we have    ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 is a contactomorphism that maps @xmath6 onto @xmath7 with @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that when @xmath21 , we can squeeze any domain into an arbitrary small neighborhood of @xmath22 by a single contactomorphism .    in their pioneering paper @xcite , eliashberg , kim , and polterovich settle the correct notion of contact squeezing , in the sense of the following :    let @xmath23 , @xmath24 be open domains in a contact manifold @xmath25 .",
    "we say @xmath23 can be squeezed into @xmath24 if there exists a compactly supported contact isotopy @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] , such that @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .    when @xmath25 is the prequantization space @xmath3 , they address the question whether a contact ball of certain size can be squeezed into a smaller one , and then amazingly discover a squeezing and a non - squeezing results for different sizes respectively .",
    "the following is their non - squeezing theorem .",
    "assume that @xmath30 .",
    "then for all @xmath31 , the contact ball @xmath6 can be squeezed into the smaller one @xmath7 .",
    "the authors offer the following quasi - classical interpretation : think of the length of the circle @xmath32 to be the planck constant .",
    "let @xmath33 be the probability density function and @xmath34 be the phase function of an unit mass quantum particle at the initial time @xmath35 .",
    "the quantum motion of this particle in the presence of a potential function @xmath36 is described by the schrdinger equation : @xmath37    the functions @xmath38 and @xmath25 generate a legendrian submanifold of @xmath3 : @xmath39    on the other hand , the corresponding classical motion of this particle is described by the hamiltonian flow on the classical phase space @xmath2 which has a lift to a flow of contactomorphism @xmath40 of the prequantization space given by the following system @xmath41    for time @xmath42 small enough , the image @xmath43 can be written as a legendrian submanifold @xmath44 , and the push - forward of density @xmath45 can be written as @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 denotes the projection from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding wave function @xmath48 is a quasi - classical approximate solution of the above schrdinger equation .",
    "the balls @xmath0 are in fact energy levels of the classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "the squeezing theorem says that at sub - quantum scale ( this means that @xmath49 is less than the planck constant ) , level sets are indistinguishable .",
    "one can also say that the symplectic rigidity of the balls @xmath0 in the classical phase space @xmath2 is lost after prequantization , i.e. after joining an extra @xmath32-variable .",
    "+ however , the situation is totally different when it comes to large scale .",
    "they manage to prove a non - squeezing theorem when an integer can be inserted into the two sizes .",

    ", they develop the idea of orderability of contactomorphism group and apply this to the study of contact squeezability . for more detailed discussions about orderability",
    "we refer the reader to giroux s bourbaki paper @xcite as well as the work of sandon @xcite@xcite in which she uses generating functions to define a bi - invariant metric on the contactomorphism groups of @xmath3 and recover the non - squeezing theorem of @xcite .",
    "there is also work of albers - merry @xcite to obtain similar results by using rabinowitz floer homology .",
    "also see the work of chernov and nemirovski @xcite@xcite for connection to lorentz geometry .",
    "+ the case @xmath51 remains open in their paper @xcite .",
    "this is covered by the main result of the present paper :    [ main ] if @xmath52 , then it is impossible to squeeze @xmath6 into @xmath7 .",
    "+ the paper uses terminologies and results from the theory of algebraic microlocal analysis .",
    "the major machinery we rely on is about sheaves and their _ microlocal singular supports _ which are developed in @xcite .",
    "fix a ground field @xmath53 and let @xmath54 denote the derived category of sheaves of @xmath55vector spaces on a smooth manifold @xmath56 .",
    "the notion of microlocal singular supports ( micro - supports ) which we denote by @xmath57 , is defined as follows :    ( @xcite , definition 5.1.2 ) let @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we say @xmath60 if there exists an open neighborhood @xmath61 of @xmath62 such that for any @xmath63 and any real @xmath64-function @xmath65 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we have @xmath69    it is proved in @xcite that the set @xmath70 is always conic closed and involutive ( also known as coisotropic ) in @xmath71 and this allows us to approximate a given lagrangian with those @xmath70 satisfying special requirements .",
    "in addition , they have certain functorial properties with respect to grothendieck s six operations . for convenience of the reader",
    ", these rules are listed in * appendix * ( see section [ appendix ] ) .",
    "recently , guillermou @xcite deduced a new proof of gromov - eliashberg @xmath72-rigidity theorem from the involutivity of micro - supports .",
    "see also the paper of nadler and zaslow @xcite for its application to fukaya category .    in @xcite",
    ", tamarkin gives a new approach to symplectic non - displaceability problems based on microlocal sheaf theory .",
    "for a closed subset @xmath73 in @xmath71 one might consider the category of sheaves micro - supported in @xmath73 , but in general the set @xmath73 is not conic .",
    "tamarkin s idea is to add an extra variable @xmath74 to @xmath56 and to work in the localized triangulated category @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cotangent coordinate of @xmath74 and @xmath77 denotes the full subcategory consists of objects @xmath78 such that @xmath79 . by conification along the extra variable , subsets in @xmath71",
    "can be lifted to conic ones in @xmath80 , which allow us to define a full subcategory @xmath81 of objects in @xmath82 micro - supported on the conification of @xmath73 .",
    "tamarkin also proves a key theorem of hamiltonian shifting which asserts that for a given compactly supported hamiltonian isotopy @xmath83 of @xmath71 , there exists a functor @xmath84 from @xmath81 to @xmath85 such that any object @xmath78 in @xmath81 is isomorphic to its image @xmath86 in @xmath82 up to torsion objects .",
    "let @xmath87 be the translation by @xmath88 units , the torsion object is defined to be the object @xmath89 in @xmath82 such that the natural morphism @xmath90 becomes zero in @xmath82 when the positive number @xmath88 is sufficiently large .",
    "it turns out that contact manifolds and contact isotopies perfectly fit into tamarkin s conic symplectic framework .",
    "moreover , the possibility of torsion objects is ruled out by the fact that the circle @xmath32 is an additive quotient of the extra variable @xmath91 . in * section [ manifold ] * we transform the problem of contact isotopies to the level of conic @xmath92-equivariant hamiltonian isotopies on a certain symplectic manifold .",
    "* section [ projector ] * is devoted to construction of the projector .",
    "let me explain what projector means through this paper .",
    "given a category @xmath93 and its full subcategories @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we say that @xmath94 is the _ left semi - orthogonal complement _ of @xmath95 if @xmath96 . a _ projector _ from @xmath93 to @xmath94 is a functor @xmath97 which is right adjoint to the embedding functor @xmath98 .",
    "similarly the projector @xmath99 is the left adjoint functor of @xmath100 . in other words",
    "we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 . put @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath104 and @xmath95 is consisted of objects micro - supported outside the open contact ball ( see [ action ] ) , the projector @xmath105 is represented explicitly by a convolution kernel @xmath106 .",
    "this means that for @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 . there also exist a kernel @xmath109 representing @xmath110 and a kernel @xmath111 representing @xmath112 . moreover , the natural morphisms of functors @xmath113 are represented by a distinguished triangle @xmath114 in the triangulated category @xmath115 .    in general these projectors",
    "are expected to shrink the possibilities of micro - supports in the cotangent space according to the type of our geometry problems .",
    "this allows us to write down the kernels of these projectors . by",
    "kernel _ we mean the sheaf that represents the prescribed functor by composition or convolution with it .",
    "the kernel associated to a projector here in this paper is in some sense unique .",
    "tamarkin s idea is to use @xmath116 between these kernels to produce hamiltonian invariants . in his paper @xcite",
    ", @xmath116 realizes non - displaceability of two compact subsets in the symplectic manifold . as an example",
    ", he shows that in @xmath117 any two choices from the two subsets @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( clifford torus ) are non - displaceable .",
    "one can also assign a novikov ring action on those @xmath116 s .",
    "we hope this formalism will inspire an alternative approach to fukaya category in the future .    in * section [ invariant ] *",
    "we construct a family of contact invariants . given any positive integer @xmath14 and certain open domains @xmath61 in @xmath3 we define a complex @xmath120 using @xmath116 between the kernel that shrinks micro - supports into @xmath61 and the kernel of discretized circle @xmath121 .",
    "with the help of sheaf quantization techniques ( see kashiwara - schapira - guillermou @xcite@xcite ) we manage to prove that these @xmath120 are contact isotopy invariants ( see * theorem [ inv ] * ) .",
    "the more important thing is that the way we define @xmath120 leads to a natural @xmath121-action on @xmath120 and makes @xmath120 an object of the derived category of @xmath122$]-modules .",
    "furthermore this makes @xmath120 into an @xmath121-equivariant object ( see * [ cyclic ] * for its motivation and explanation ) .",
    "this approach resembles the cyclic homology in a hamiltonian fashion .",
    "we then move forward to the computation of these invariants when @xmath61 is a contact ball @xmath6 using the explicit form of projectors constructed in the previous section .    in * section [ proof ]",
    "* we show that when @xmath123 and @xmath49 are greater than or equal to 1 , one can select an appropriate integer @xmath14 which depends on both @xmath4 and @xmath1 such that the naturality of morphisms between the three invariants ( i.e. , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) obtained from the presumed squeezability is violated by the graded algebra structure of the yoneda product @xmath127}^{\\bullet}({\\mathds{k}};{\\mathds{k}})$ ] after we pass to the equivariant derived category @xmath128 .",
    "this destroys the existence of contact squeezing and proves the main theorem ( * theorem [ main ] * ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we are considering not only bounded derived categories of sheaves but also locally bounded ones . by locally bounded sheaf @xmath78 we mean for any relative compact open subset @xmath25 , the pull - back sheaf @xmath129 is cohomologically bounded and we are working in this full subcategory .",
    "the notion of micro - support is adopted .",
    "also there is no _ a priori _ notion of derived hom - functor for general triangulated categories , but in our paper all categories are obtained by localizations of derived categories of sheaves .",
    "so all @xmath116-functors we implement here are inherited from the structure of cochain complexes .",
    "due to the unboundedness issue it may be better to bear in mind the frameworks of the homotopy category of cochain complexes , differential graded categories and model structures .",
    "all tensor products @xmath130 , as well as external products @xmath131 , stand for left derived functors of usual tensor products of sheaves .",
    "for more information about the interaction between sheaf theory and symplectic topology we would like to refer the reader to the excellent expository lecture by c. viterbo @xcite which can be found on his website .",
    "it also contains many useful discussions about generating function apparatus and their application to symplectic geometry .",
    "it is sandon who @xcite uses generating function techniques to define contact homology , by extending traynor s symplectic homology @xcite , for open domains in @xmath3 and gives a new proof of non - squeezability result of eliashberg - kim - polterovich ( * theorem [ gap ] * ) .",
    "it turns out that for open balls their symplectic / contact homology happen to coincide with our construction when forgetting @xmath121-action",
    ". it will be very interesting if this coincidence holds for more general domains .",
    "finally we need to mention that during the preparation of this paper , the author is told by eliashberg that fraser @xcite also proves the same non - squeezing theorem .",
    "in fact she has two proofs , one based on generating function techniques and another in the original context of @xcite .",
    "all known approaches are using some sort of equivariant constructions inspired by tamarkin several years ago .",
    "i was told about this project by my thesis advisor , dima tamarkin and would like to thank deeply for his guidance and generosity .",
    "it is dima who shares with me many profound ideas towards the result and useful techniques in microlocal sheaf theory .",
