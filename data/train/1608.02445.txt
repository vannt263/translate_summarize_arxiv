    "sec : intro    a real _ seminormed involutive algebra ( or @xmath3-algebra ) _ is a pair @xmath11 , consisting of a real associative algebra @xmath1 endowed with an involutive antiautomorphism @xmath3 and a submultiplicative seminorm @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "our project , started in @xcite , eventually aims at a systematic understanding of unitary representations of unitary groups @xmath15 of real seminormed involutive algebras @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath1 is unital , its _ unitary group _ is @xmath16 and if @xmath1 is non - unital , then @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unitization of  @xmath1 .",
    "typical examples we have in mind are algebras of the form @xmath19 for a banach @xmath3-algebra @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a smooth manifold and @xmath23 ( or more general algebras of sections of @xmath3-algebra bundles ) . focusing on unitary representations of @xmath15 which are boundary values of representations @xmath24 of the ball semigroups @xmath25 lead us in @xcite to a complete reduction of this problem to the case where @xmath1 is a @xmath0-algebra and the representation is holomorphic on @xmath26 .",
    "this reduction is achieved by the fact that @xmath24 factors through the universal map @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the enveloping @xmath0-algebra of  @xmath11 .     as we learned from jan stochel , he obtained closely related results in @xcite which has some overlap with @xcite .    for a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1",
    ", we write @xmath29 for the @xmath30-direct sum of the @xmath0-algebras @xmath31 , where the tensor products are constructed from the maximal @xmath0-cross norm .",
    "we have a holomorphic @xmath3-homomorphism of semigroups @xmath32 one of the main results of @xcite implies that , for every bounded holomorphic @xmath3-representation @xmath33 of the multiplicative @xmath3-semigroup @xmath26 , there exists a ( linear ) representation @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "as @xmath36 is the direct sum of the ideals @xmath2 , this in turn reduces all classification issues to representation theory of the @xmath0-algebras  @xmath2 . via the homogeneous multiplicative map @xmath37 the representations of @xmath2 are in one - to - one correspondence with multiplicative holomorphic @xmath3-representations of the multiplicative @xmath3-semigroup @xmath4 ( or the unit ball @xmath26 ) which are homogeneous of degree @xmath38 .",
    "we call them _ polynomial representations of @xmath1_. as @xmath15 is a totally real submanifold of @xmath1 ( resp . , of @xmath39 in the non - unital case ) , these representations are uniquely determined by their restrictions to @xmath15 , which are norm - continuous unitary representations . the multiplicative maps lead to natural maps @xmath40 which embeds the @xmath0-algebra dual space @xmath41 into the set @xmath42 of equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of @xmath15",
    ". this method of constructing points in @xmath42 requires a detailed understanding of the representation theory of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 in terms of the representation theory of @xmath1 , and this is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "representations of unitary groups are thus related to the interaction between @xmath0-algebras and infinite dimensional analyticity a theme that was developed in the comprehensive monograph @xcite and has been explored until recently , for instance in the prequel @xcite to the present paper .",
    "we touch on that theme here again , proving , among other things , that holomorphy , although much weaker than linearity , is strong enough to imply for instance complete positivity of multiplicative homomorphisms of @xmath0-algebras ( see proposition  [ cpc ] below ) .",
    "the present approach to representation theory of infinite dimensional unitary groups is based on @xmath0-algebras and their multiplicative representations and is thus complementary to other recent works on representation theory of infinite dimensional lie groups , such as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to shed fresh light on , and to partially extend , some results on schur  weyl duality in infinite dimensions from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a unital @xmath0-algebra , its unitary group @xmath15 is a banach  lie group whose representation theory is much more complex than the representation theory of @xmath1 .",
    "that fact is already apparent in the special case of matrix algebras @xmath43 , when @xmath15 is the compact lie group @xmath44 with a rich representation theory , while the tautological representation on @xmath45 is the only irreducible representation of @xmath46 up to unitary equivalence .",
    "this classical situation is of course well understood using various well - known tools , including for instance    * the peter ",
    "weyl theorem on compact groups ; * the cartan ",
    "weyl theorem on the highest weights of irreducible representations ; * the schur ",
    "weyl theory on tensor realizations of representations of classical groups .",
    "these tools are quite specific to finite dimensions , inasmuch as they rely on haar measures or on eigenvectors of the adjoint representation .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that , for any unital @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 , the schur ",
    "weyl method leads for every irreducible representation @xmath47 of @xmath1 to an infinite family @xmath48 of irreducible representations of @xmath15 , where @xmath49 is a partition of @xmath38 and @xmath9 decomposes under @xmath15 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the dimension of the irreducible representation of @xmath5 corresponding to  @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite it was left unclear to which extent one thus exhausts the unitary dual @xmath42 of @xmath15 . as a by - product of our investigation , we prove in theorem  [ sw - main ] that if @xmath1 is a separable @xmath0-algebra , then the unitary dual @xmath42 is exhausted by the representations constructed by the schur  weyl method if and only if @xmath1 is the @xmath0-algebra @xmath53 of compact operators on a separable complex hilbert space . among other things , this explains why the remarkably complete results of @xcite on unitary irreducible representations of @xmath15 for @xmath54 were never extended to unitary groups of more general @xmath0-algebras .",
    "our approach to the representation theory of @xmath2 is based on the fact that this algebra is the fixed - point set of the permutation action of the permutation group @xmath5 on the tensor power @xmath6 , hence we can use the old observation of @xcite for describing the dual space @xmath41 as an open subset of the dual space of the corresponding crossed product @xmath55 . we actually extend that approach to unitary equivalence classes of factor representations , because the unitary group @xmath15 in general has norm - continuous unitary factor representations of type ii and iii . in this connection ,",
    "some specific applications are given in theorem  [ fact3 ] .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss the structure of the symmetric powers @xmath2 of a few specific types of @xmath0-algebras . in section  [ sec:3 ]",

    "representations of @xmath0-algebras . here",
    "our main result is theorem  [ cpc ] , asserting that every multiplicative homomorphism of @xmath0-algebras is completely positive , contractive and a sum of homogeneous homomorphisms . to understand the passage from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , it is natural to study @xmath2 as the fixed point algebra @xmath56 for the natural action of the symmetric group @xmath5 on  @xmath6",
    ". therefore we study in section  [ sec:4 ] @xmath0-dynamical systems @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a finite group . here",
    "our main point is to describe the relation between representations of the fixed point algebra @xmath59 and the crossed product @xmath60 , in which @xmath59 is embedded as a hereditary subalgebra . here",
    "the main results are the description of the factor representations of the crossed product in terms of induced representations ( theorem  [ factbij ] ) , its refinement for irreducible representations ( proposition  [ irr ] ) and , eventually , the description of @xmath61 in theorem  [ fix ] .",

    "we denote by @xmath77 the relation of unitary equivalence and by @xmath78 the ( weaker ) relation of quasi - equivalence of group or algebra representations on hilbert spaces @xcite . for any @xmath0-algebra @xmath1",
    "we denote by @xmath79 its set of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible @xmath3-representations . for every irreducible @xmath3-representation @xmath80 ,",

    "the set @xmath79 is considered as a topological space endowed with the fell topology , which may be described by the condition that the correspondence @xmath82\\in\\widehat{\\ca}\\mid { \\mathcal j}\\not\\subset\\ker\\pi\\}$ ] is a bijection between the closed two - sided ideals @xmath83 and the open subsets of @xmath79 .",
    "sec:2    as mentioned above , in the present paper we develop some mechanisms to get more explicit access to the @xmath0-algebras @xmath2 for a given @xmath0-algebra  @xmath1 .",
    "to illustrate that idea , we will briefly discuss here symmetric tensor powers of some basic examples of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "ex1 if @xmath22 is a compact space and @xmath84 , then , for every @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 because @xmath87 .",
    "from that we immediately infer that @xmath88 where @xmath89 stands for the quotient space with respect to the natural action of the symmetric group @xmath5 by permutations of the coordinates of points in the @xmath38th cartesian power  @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath89 need not be a smooth manifold if @xmath22 is .    if @xmath91 is a finite set , then @xmath92 , hence the above remarks imply that for any @xmath93 , we have a linear isomorphism @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the number of combinations of @xmath96 elements taken by @xmath38 at a time , where we allow any element to be selected repeatedly ( equivalently , the number of non - decreasing functions @xmath97 ) .",
    "ex2 let @xmath98 for a compact space @xmath22 and a unital @xmath0-algebra @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath99 is nuclear and one has a canonical @xmath3-isomorphism @xmath100 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.9.4.4 ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we want to determine the @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath101 where @xmath5 acts on this algebra by @xmath102 accordingly , @xmath2 can be identified with the set @xmath103 of @xmath5-equivariant maps @xmath104 . in this sense",
    "it is an _ equivariant map algebra _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the center of @xmath6 contains @xmath105 , so that we obtain @xmath106 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "since every irreducible representation of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 determines a central character @xmath107 , and all these characters are given by evaluation in an @xmath5-orbit @xmath108 \\in x^n / s_n$ ] , it factors through the restriction map given by @xmath109 let @xmath110 be the stabilizer of some representative @xmath111 , so that @xmath112 .",
    "evaluating in the representative , we see that the image of @xmath113 is isomorphic to @xmath114 . assuming without loss of generality that @xmath115 , we see that @xmath116 is a product of symmetric groups .",
    "this further leads to @xmath117 therefore the determination of the irreducible representations of @xmath2 is reduced to the determination of irreducible representations of finite tensor products of the algebras @xmath118 .",
    "if @xmath20 is of type @xmath119 , then so is every @xmath118 ( see proposition  [ cross ] below ) .",
    "further , irreducible representations of tensor powers of type i algebras are tensor products of irreducible representations .",
    "this reduces the problem to determine the irreducible representations of @xmath2 to the corresponding problem for the target algebras @xmath120 .    from @xcite",
    "we know that every irreducible representation @xmath121 of a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 and every partition @xmath52 of @xmath38 determine an irreducible representation @xmath48 of @xmath2 .",
    "one may expect to obtain from every faithful irreducible representation @xmath121 of @xmath1 a decomposition @xmath122 from the corresponding decomposition of @xmath123 , acting on @xmath9 , where it commutes with the action of @xmath5 .",
    "we shall see in example  [ ex : bh ] below that this is far from being true in general , as the example @xmath124 shows . however , it is true for the ideal @xmath53 of compact operators .",
    "ex3 let @xmath54 be the @xmath0-algebra of compact operators on the infinite dimensional complex hilbert space  @xmath74 .",
    "using the fact that for any finite dimensional complex vector spaces @xmath125 and @xmath126 one has a canonical isomorphism @xmath127 and approximating the compact operators by finite - rank operators , we obtain , for any integer @xmath128 , a canonical isomorphism of @xmath0-algebras @xmath129 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "b.20 ) for details ) . this isomorphism intertwines the permutation action of @xmath5 on @xmath6 and the spatial action of @xmath5 on @xmath130 defined via the unitary representation @xmath131 defined by permutation of factors in tensor monomials . therefore , considering the fixed - point algebras of the above two actions of @xmath5 , we see that the isomorphism @xmath129 defines by restriction an isomorphism @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the multiplicity space for the irreducible representation @xmath134 of @xmath5 in @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , from the @xmath5-decomposition @xmath135 it follows that a compact operator on @xmath9 commutes with @xmath5 if and only if it is a direct sum of operators of the form @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "note that is the decomposition of @xmath2 according to the general structure theory of @xmath0-algebras of compact operators as developed for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.4.5 ) .",
    "ex4 if @xmath1 and @xmath20 are any @xmath0-algebras and @xmath138 is a @xmath3-homomorphism , then for any integer @xmath128 one has natural @xmath3-homomorphisms @xmath139 and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are functors from the category of @xmath0-algebras into itself .",
    "the behavior of these functors with respect to inductive limits of nuclear @xmath0-algebras sheds some light on symmetric tensor powers of af - algebras , that is , @xmath0-algebras that are inductive limits of finite dimensional @xmath0-algebras .",
    "in fact , let @xmath1 be any nuclear @xmath0-algebra with a sequence of nuclear closed @xmath3-subalgebras @xmath142 whose union is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "it is easily seen that one has a sequence of closed @xmath3-subalgebras @xmath143 whose union is dense in @xmath6 , and then a sequence of closed @xmath3-subalgebras @xmath144 whose union is dense in @xmath2 .",
    "thus each of the functors @xmath140 and @xmath141 commutes with inductive limits of nuclear @xmath0-algebras .",
    "since these functors preserve the category of finite dimensional @xmath0-algebras , it then follows that they also preserve the category of af - algebras .",
    "we point out however that , as a by - product of example  [ ex3 ] , if @xmath1 is a uhf - algebra ( that is , a unital @xmath0-algebra that is the inductive limit of a sequence of unital @xmath3-subalgebras isomorphic to full matrix algebras ) and @xmath128 , then @xmath2 is not a uhf - algebra .",
    "more precisely , example  [ ex3 ] shows that if @xmath43 for some @xmath145 , then @xmath2 is the direct sum of at least two full matrix algebras if @xmath146 .",
    "now let @xmath147 with @xmath148 be an uhf algebra .",
    "since @xmath1 is a direct limit of finite dimensional simple matrix algebras @xmath149 with @xmath150 , the @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 is the direct limit of the @xmath0-algebras @xmath151 with @xmath152 ( example  [ ex3 ] ) , where the projection onto the @xmath52-summand corresponds to restriction to the corresponding @xmath5-isotypic subspace in @xmath153 . from the @xmath5-equivariance of the inclusions @xmath154 ,",
    "it follows that the inclusion @xmath155 induces inclusions @xmath156 , so that we obtain a direct sum decomposition @xmath157 and the construction implies in particular that the algebras @xmath158 are simple and act irreducibly on @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the hilbert direct limit of the spaces  @xmath161 .",
