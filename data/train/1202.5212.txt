    "in the current standard picture for structure formation , galaxies are believed to form from condensation of gas within the potential wells of dark matter halos ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , understanding how gas is accreted onto dark matter haloes and galaxies is crucial to understand the process of galaxy formation .",
    "substantial numerical work recently focused on the ` cold accretion ' mode ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; keres et al . 2005 ) as the main driver for gas accretion at high redshift and for haloes less massive than a few times @xmath4 .",
    "the distinction between two modes of accretion , cold and hot , was clearly understood when the first hierarchical galaxy formation models were presented ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; binney 1977 ; see also benson & bower 2011 ) .",
    "if the halo virial temperature is larger than the temperature of the accreting gas , this will accrete supersonically , which causes the formation of an accretion shock .",
    "if the gas cooling time is longer than the dynamical time of the halo , the shock will occur at a radius that is comparable or slightly larger than the virial radius ( bertschinger 1985 ; evrard 1990 ) .",
    "if the cooling time is much shorter than the halo dynamical time , the shock will occur much closer to the forming galaxy .",
    "the gas is still heated to very high temperature , but it cools so rapidly that it can not maintain the pressure needed to support a quasi - static hot atmosphere .",
    "this picture has been validated by 1d hydrodynamical simulations ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; see also forcada - miro & white 1997 ) , and by recent 3d hydrodynamical simulations ( keres et al . 2005 ; ocvirk et al .",
    "these simulations have shown that a static atmosphere of hot , virialized gas develops in haloes above @xmath5 , and that this ` transition mass ' is nearly constant as a function of redshift .",
    "simulations have also pointed out that , even when a shock is present , cold gas accretion can occur along filaments that penetrate deep inside the hot halo and might funnel gas to the central galaxy , elevating its star formation rates .    brooks et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated gas accretion in a set of high resolution simulations spanning about two orders of magnitude in halo mass .",
    "they find that , for galaxies in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 , the early growth of the stellar disk is dominated by gas that is not shocked to the virial temperature of the dark matter haloes , and that cold accretion dominates at all times for galaxies less massive than our milky way .",
    "a high fraction of gas accretion onto halos is found to be smooth , even for the most massive galaxy considered . in a more recent study , van de voort et al .",
    "( 2011 ) used the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ; schaye et al .",
    "2010 ) to investigate accretion rates onto haloes and galaxies , and their dependence on halo mass and redshift .",
    "they confirm that hot mode accretion dominates the growth of massive haloes , but show that accretion onto galaxies is very sensitive to feedback processes and metal line cooling .",
    "in addition , they confirm that gas accretion on the halo is smooth . finally , oppenheimer et al ( 2010 ) studied how gas accretion is affected by kinetic feedback .",
    "they found that a significant amount of the gas that later form stars has been previously processed through the winds .",
    "wind channel _ is relevant below @xmath8 .    in this paper , we re - address the issue of gas accretion onto the halo and onto the galaxy , taking advantage of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy - size haloes .",
    "we use our new star  formation and feedback algorithm , muppi ( murante et al 2010 ) , that includes an effective _ thermal _ feedback but no kinetic feedback .",
    "our aim is to verify whether , in this scheme , gas accretion onto the central part of the halo remains mainly cold and smooth , and whether these results are robust against increasing numerical resolution , well above that adopted in cosmological simulations .",
    "we study the accretion of gas onto the _ halo _ and on its central part , the _ galaxy _ , using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy - size haloes .",

    "these do not immediately radiate it away because of the hot gas low density . as a result",
    ", our scheme provides effective thermal feedback : gas particles inside and near star  forming regions are heated , and escape from their parent structure along the path of minimal resistance ( i.e. the direction of lowest density ) , with velocities up to @xmath20 km s@xmath13 , giving rise to galactic fountains .",

    "we analyze the thermal history of gas particle accreting _ onto the halo _ , and _ onto the galaxy _ by using the following definitions .",
    "the _ halo _ is defined as a sphere centered on the most bound particle , and with virial radius enclosing an overdensity of 200 times the critical density at the redshift of interest .",
    "the _ galaxy _ includes all particles within one tenth of the virial radius .",
    "we will see that this distinction is very important , since the gas accreting onto these components can have different properties . to perform our analysis , we used 131 snapshots , roughly equispaced in redshift from @xmath23 .    at each snapshot , we selected the most massive progenitor of our @xmath16 halo , by using a standard friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath24 .",
    "we then assumed that a gas particle is accreted onto the halo ( galaxy ) at a snapshot @xmath25 if it is part of the halo ( galaxy ) at the corresponding snapshot but not at the previous one @xmath26 .",
    "each gas particle is then traced back in time , and the highest temperature reached during its past evolution is recorded .",
    "we distinguish gas accreting in three channels : _",
    "( i ) _ cold gas , made of particles that never reached temperatures larger than @xmath27 k ; _ ( ii ) warm _ gas , composed of particles that were hotter than @xmath28 but colder than @xmath29 k ; _ ( iii ) _ hot gas , made of particles that reached temperatures larger than @xmath30 . in previous work , the _",
    "warm _ channel has been included in the hot one . in this study , we have considered this separate channel to quantify the accretion that occurs at ` intermediate ' temperatures , that are indicative of feedback from supernovae ( sne ) rather than shock heating .    finally , we identified all self - bound structures at each snapshot using the algorithm subfind ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) , and built merger trees for all of them using the same procedure described in springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    using these merger trees , we check if gas particles accreted on the halo or on the galaxy belong to a distinct subhalo at the previous time , i.e. for each accretion channel , we determine the fraction of gas accreted in `` clumps '' .",
    "gas particle that were not assigned to a subhalo in the past are considered as `` smoothly '' accreted .",
    "figure  [ fig : accr_channels ] shows the fractional mass accretion rates in the three channels defined above .",
    "right panels are for accretion on the _ halo _ , while left panels show the corresponding accretion rates on the _",
    "galaxy_. we show the accretion rates for the resolution levels r1 and r2 , as well as for a r1 run that adopted the springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) effective model ( see below ) .",
    "the figure shows that gas is accreted on the halo mainly via the _ cold _ channel for all runs considered . at low redshift , @xmath31 , the importance of _ warm _ and _ hot _ channels increases , in agreement with previous studies ( as in , e.g. , keres et al .",
    "2006 , , brooks et al 2009 , van de voort et al 2011 ) .",
    "results are quite different for the accretion onto the galaxy . in this case , the _ cold _ and the _ warm _ channels equally contribute to gas accretion at high redshift . at later times",
    ", the _ hot _ channel provides the dominant contribution .",
    "our findings are robust against resolution : our r2 simulation has a mass resolution which is sufficient to resolve halos of @xmath32 m@xmath21 with @xmath20 dm particles .",
    "therefore , results from this simulations are reliable also at high redshift and , as shown in figure  [ fig : accr_channels ] , they are in excellent agreement with those obtained for the r1 run .",
    "figure  [ fig : faces ] shows density maps of gas which accreted onto the _ galaxy _ between redshift @xmath18 and @xmath33 .",
    "we show the gas at previous redshifts : @xmath34 ( left column ) , @xmath35 ( middle column ) , and @xmath18 ( right column ) , for the r1 simulation .",
    "maps are centered on the most massive progenitor at the corresponding redshift .",
    "the upper , middle and lower rows are for the _ cold _ , _ warm _ and _ hot _ channels , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that the cold gas is characterized by a very clumpy distribution , while the hot gas is always diffused around the most massive progenitor .",
    "interestingly , warm gas is more diffuse than cold gas , but it surrounds the cold clumps .",
    "this suggests that the infalling cold clumps are strongly star forming , and that they heat and eject part of their gas while infalling towards the central galaxy .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the multi - phase nature of the accreting gas : sn thermal feedback is effective at heating multi - phase particles .",
    "so , by computing the fraction of gas particles that were multi - phase when they reached their maximum temperature , one can disentangle the influence of sn heating from gravitational shock heating . for the r1 simulation , averaging over the entire redshift range ( from @xmath23 to @xmath16 )",
    ", we find that when accreting gas reaches its maximum temperature , @xmath36% of it is multi - phase and star forming in the _ cold _ channel .",
    "the corresponding fractions for the _ warm _ and _ hot _ channels are @xmath37% and @xmath38% , respectively .",
    "this suggests that gas in the _ warm _ channel is heated by sn feedback , while gas in the _ hot _ channel is heated by gravitational shocks .    to better illustrate the role of effective thermal feedback we run simulation r1 using the widely used effective model of springel & hernquist ( sh , 2003 ) for star formation , with kinetic feedback and velocity @xmath39 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the resulting accretion rates are shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig : accr_channels ] : the contribution of the _ warm _ channel to accretion on the galaxy becomes negligible , while gas accretion in the _ cold _ channel increases .",
    "this confirms that simulations with uneffective thermal feedback are unable to heat cold flows into the warm channel , even when they produce significant outflows .",
    "finally , for each channel , we analyse the _ clumpiness _ of gas accretion , both on the _ halo _ and on the _ galaxy _ by determining if its particles belonged to an accreting satellite of were accreted smoothly .    results are shown in figure  [ fig : smoothclumpy ] .",
    "for accretion on the halo , we find that _ total _",
    "gas is mainly smooth ( as in , e.g , brooks et al .",
    "2003 , van de voort et al .",
    "2011 ) . at @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath40 per cent of the gas has been accreted smoothly in the r1 simulation .",
    "smooth accretion dominates the _ hot _ channel , while in the _ cold _ one , smooth and clumpy accretion contribute equally to the total accretion rate : at @xmath16 smooth accretion accounts for only 49 per cent of the overall cold accretion .    also the total accretion rate on the galaxy is mainly smooth , @xmath41 per cent for r1 , and hot accretion shows the same trend found for the accretion on the halos .",
    "we find a significant difference , however , in the _ cold _ channel .",
    "in fact , this channel is dominated by clumpy accretion , with 60 per cent of the gas accreted in this way .",
    "the gas accreted through the _ warm _ channel is also prevalently clumpy .",
    "we stress that the clumps that contribute to the cold and warm channels have a significant ( @xmath42 85 per cent ) dm fraction , ruling out possible numerical problems of the sph technique that can , in certain conditions , produce `` cold - gas only '' spurious blobs .",
    "we analyzed the gas accretion rate in cosmological numerical simulations of a galaxy - size halo .",
    "we take advantage of our new muppi star formation and feedback model that provides effective _ thermal _ feedback and use different resolution levels to test the robustness of our results .",
    "we distinguished between gas accretion onto the halo ( defined as all the matter included in the redshift - dependant virial radius ) , and accretion onto the central galaxy ( defined as all the material included within one tenth of the virial radius ) .",
    "we traced back all gas particles in our simulations , and defined a gas particle to be accreted at redshift @xmath43 if it was not part of the main progenitor ( or of its central galaxy ) of our @xmath16 halo at @xmath44 , but became part of it at @xmath43 .",
    "we defined three accretion channels : a cold one , including gas particles whose maximum past temperature was lower than @xmath45 k , a hot channel , that includes gas particles with maximum past temperature larger than @xmath46k , and an intermediate _",
    "warm _ channel .      * the _ warm _ accretion channel becomes as important as the cold one at high redshift , when considering the accretion on the central _",
    "galaxy_. this trend is robust against numerical resolution . * gas particles in",
    "the _ warm _ channel are heated by sn feedback .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the multi - phase nature of the gas , and by the fact that a simulation of the same halo carried out with a model that does not include effective thermal feedback shows negligible accretion rates through this channel .    regarding the accretion on the halo , our findings confirm previous studies : the ` cold ' accretion mode on the halo is important at high redshift , while the ` hot ' accretion mode becomes dominant at lower redshift . however , accretion rates onto the halo are different from accretion rates onto the central galaxy .",
    "we find that a significant amount of gas is accreted on the galaxy through a _",
    "warm _ channel .",
    "the gas is in cold clumps when entering the halo , and becomes warm because of the sn feedback originating from star formation within the clumps .",
    "van de voort et al .",
    "( 2011 ) too analyzed the clumpiness of the accreted gas , but they included all clumps with mass ratio smaller than 1:10 in their smooth component .",
    "these clumps are , however , very dense and star - forming , and effectively heat the cold gas to the warm channel .",
    "oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that a large fraction of low - z star formation experienced a wind phase in the past .",
    "however , they studied the effect of _ kinetic _ feedback , and showed that this channel becomes important below @xmath22 .",
    "their results are thus complementary to those shown in this letter .",
    "the picture emerging from our analysis can be sketched as follow : at high redshift , accreting gas is mainly cold , partly clumpy and partly smooth .",
    "not all of the smooth cold gas reaches the central part of the halos because , behaving as non - collisional material , cold , un - shocked gas is not able to loose orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "thus , only gas streams with very low impact parameters can funnel gas to the central galaxy , contributing to its star formation .",
    "cold clumps suffer dynamical friction and spiral towards the center .",
    "since they are very dense , their star formation rate is high , and part of the gas they contain is heated by sn feedback , and is accreted onto the galaxy as _ warm _ , slightly less clumpy , material .",
    "we do not ascribe these findings to specific features of our sub - resolution model , and argue that _ any _ effective thermal feedback scheme would give similar results . in this picture ,",
    "the time needed by the cold gas to reach the central galaxy is neither the free fall time nor the cooling time .",
    "smooth cold accreting gas can only reach the galaxy if the impact parameter is small .",
    "in contrast , cold clumps are subject to dynamical friction so they can reach the central galaxy even with non negligible impact parameters , over a time - scale that is determined by dynamical friction",
    ".    however , the exact quantification of warm flows may well depend on model details .",
    "in particular , the entrainment of cold gas into the multi - phase particle may lead to some overestimation of the amount of warm flows .",
    "we will address this issue in future work .",
    "it is widely accepted that stellar feedback plays an important role in determining the physical properties of galaxies .",
    "it remains , however , unclear if the nature of feedback is predominantly kinetic or thermal .",
    "our results demonstrate that stellar feedback strongly affects the termodynamical state of the gas accreting onto galaxies .",
    "in particular , we argue that a mode of feedback that is primarily thermal would produce significant amount of warm gas accreting onto galaxies at high redshift .",
    "this has noticeable consequences on the observability of gas flows infalling onto high redshift galaxies , and may explain , at least in part , why cold flows have been difficult to detect , to date .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with matteo viel .",
    "our simulations were carried out at the `` centro interuniversitario del nord - est per il calcolo elettronico '' ( cineca , bologna ) , with cpu time assigned under two inaf / cineca grants .",
    "the r2 simulation was performed thanks to an inaf - cineca numerical key - project .",
