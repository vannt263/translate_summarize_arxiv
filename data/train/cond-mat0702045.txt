    "the purpose of the superposition method is to avoid a rapid temporal change in the potential within the region where the condensate density is significant , which would disrupt the reservoir .    in an experiment",
    "one could just let the condensate propagate supersonically along the waveguide created by the transverse confinement .",
    "however , the numerical treatment requires absorption at the grid edge , for which we employ a simple imaginary potential .    taking all these elements together ,",

    "( [ machderiv ] ) and ( [ qdd ] ) , the analogue hawking temperature remains fairly constant , as the decrease in speed of sound is mostly balanced by a corresponding increase in the mach number gradient .",

    "( [ machderiv ] ) and ( [ qdd ] ) were derived neglecting the quantum pressure term @xmath190 and assuming strictly a stationary state .",

    "[ piston_evaluation_plot ] that the density at the horizon is significantly less than the bulk value .",

    "[ piston_evaluation_plot ] , @xmath192 initially makes up only 2% of the energy components in bernoulli s equation ( [ hydrodyn2 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the non - phononic part of bogoliubov s dispersion relation has an effect on phonon propagation , quantified in ref .",
    "this might have to be tolerated for an outflow experiment for the following reason : the bulk condensate in fig .",
    "[ piston_evaluation_plot ] is as dense as allowed by loss .",
    "thus the only way to increase the density at the horizon , and hence the temperature , is by reducing @xmath146 in eq .",

    "the parameters were chosen to represent the case with the highest analogue hawking temperature of table  [ maxtemperatures1 ] : a sodium condensate with @xmath200 hz ( @xmath201 m ) , resulting in @xmath202 , which corresponds to @xmath203 @xmath195 .",
    "this gives @xmath204 , which places the simulation between the q1d and ttf cases .",

    "computational limitations required a small spatial domain ( @xmath212 @xmath27 m ) , containing only @xmath219 atoms . in an experiment the length of the reservoir could be much larger , reducing the temperature reduction due to condensate outflow as shown in section  [ analogue_outflow_pressure ] .",
