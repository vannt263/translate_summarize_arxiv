    "<S> new heavy gauge bosons exist in many models of new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> discovery of these @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances and the establishment of their spins , couplings , and other quantum numbers would shed light on the gauge structure of the new physics . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the polarization of the sm fermions from the gauge boson decays would decipher the handedness of the coupling of the new states , an important relic of the primordial new physics symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> since the top quark decays promptly , its decay preserves spin information . </S>",
    "<S> we show how decays of new gauge bosons into third generation fermions ( @xmath2 ) can be used to determine the handedness of the couplings of the new states and to discriminate among various new physics models . </S>"
