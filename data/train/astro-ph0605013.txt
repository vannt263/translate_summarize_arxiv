    "over the last two decades a vigorous interplay between theory and observation has led to the establishment of a standard cosmological model that not only describes the composition and evolution of the universe as a whole , but has also scored great successes in accounting for the large - scale structures observed in the universe ; for a recent review see , for example , @xcite . in this standard model ,",
    "large - scale structure is thought to be the result of the gravitational amplification of small density perturbations present in the early universe ; a mechanism known as gravitational instability .",
    "the gravitational instability process is relatively easy to understand at a qualitative level because it mostly relies only on the action of gravity , with more complex hydrodynamical and radiative effects playing a role only at late times when structure is already largely developed .",
    "moreover , when the density fluctuations are very much smaller than the average density , the growth of fluctuations can be handled quite accurately using first - order ( linear ) perturbative techniques .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies and galaxy clusters represent density enhancements well in excess of the mean density so we need to go beyond linear theory if we are to study the formation of such objects in detail .",
    "the non - linear regime of gravitational instability is analytically intractable , except in a few cases where some special symmetry applies . for the most part ,",
    "therefore , cosmologists have been forced to resort to numerical methods based on @xmath0-body computations in order to study the late stages of the evolution of density fluctuations .",
    "the use of computer simulations has revolutionized cosmology , especially in enabling the simulation of the large - scale structure expected to be found in galaxy redshift surveys and the consequent testing of models using observations . in some cases , however , such as when a very large volume and/or very high resolution is needed , one has to make more detailed predictions than can be obtained by using computational techniques . in such cases numerous analytical approximations have been suggested that provide robust results in a necessarily limited range of circumstances ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these approximate techniques also help to promote a genuine understanding of the principal processes involved in the formation of cosmological structure .",
    "analytical attempts to understand large - scale structure formation are commonly based on the assumption that cold dark matter ( cdm ) can be treated as a self - gravitating pressureless fluid .",
    "two important approximation methods can be derived from the equations of motion for this fluid by applying linear eulerian and lagrangian perturbation theory , respectively",
    ". first - order eulerian perturbation theory - the so - called _ linearized fluid approach _",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) - has been the backbone of structure formation theory for many years as a result of its simplicity and robustness at early times / on large scales .",
    "however , for gaussian initial conditions , it generically leads to unphysical regions where the matter density is negative if extrapolated to late times / small scales .",
    "although popular , the linearized fluid approach is considerably less powerful than its lagrangian counterpart - the _ zeldovich approximation _ @xcite .",
    "the zeldovich approximation considers ( linear ) perturbations in the trajectories of individual fluid elements ( particles ) , rather than in macroscopic fluid quantities such as the density field .",
    "this technique is remarkably successful in describing the pattern of structure formed from realistic ( random ) initial conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) , as long as care is taken to ensure that particle trajectories do not intersect .",
    "once trajectories cross ( a phenomenon known as _ shell - crossing _ ) , the velocity field becomes multi - valued and the density field develops a singularity ( known as a _ caustic _ ) .",
    "however , since the zeldovich approximation is kinematical , particles do not respond to the strong gravitational forces acting in the vicinity of the caustic . instead they simply continue to move along their original inertial trajectories and any structure formed is rapidly ` smeared out ' in an unrealistic manner .",
    "an alternative to the zeldovich approximation which avoids this problem is the adhesion model @xcite , an _ ad hoc _ extension of the zeldovich approximation in which particles are assumed to ` stick ' to each other when shell - crossing occurs .",
    "this sticking is achieved by including an artificial viscosity term in the usual hydrodynamical equations of motion , thus transforming the momentum equation into _",
    "burgers equation_. the viscous term becomes large when particle trajectories intersect , cancelling the component of the particle velocities perpendicular to the caustic .",
    "this prevents particles from simply sailing through the caustic and , consequently , the density singularities predicted by the zeldovich approximation are regularized and stable structures are formed .",
    "comparisons with @xmath0-body simulations have shown that the adhesion model is capable of accurately reproducing the skeleton of the ` cosmic web ' of filaments and voids that comprises the morphology of the large - scale galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "although the original motivation for the adhesion approximation was purely phenomenological , it has recently been shown that burgers equation can be naturally derived from the coarse - grained equations of motion , provided certain simplifying assumptions are made @xcite .",
    "a novel alternative approach to the study of large - scale structure formation was suggested by widrow and kaiser @xcite .",
    "they proposed a wave - mechanical description of self - gravitating matter in which collisionless cdm is modelled by a complex scalar field whose dynamics are governed by coupled schrdinger and poisson equations ( see @xcite for a relativistic extension of the original theory ) .",
    "as pointed out by coles @xcite , the ( approximately ) log - normal form of the distribution function of density perturbations can be naturally explained within this wave - mechanical formalism . by appealing to simple one - dimensional examples of gravitational collapse in a static universe , coles and spencer @xcite showed that the wave - mechanical approach offers a competitive alternative to the zeldovich approximation , provided the effective planck constant @xmath1 in the theory",
    "is chosen carefully .",
    "they also demonstrated that , unlike the zeldovich approximation , the wave - mechanical approach leads to a density field that remains non - singular when shell - crossing occurs .",
    "building on the work of coles and spencer , short and coles @xcite recently showed that , in an expanding universe , the schrdinger equation can be conveniently reduced to the free - particle schrdinger equation in the linear and quasi - linear regimes of gravitational instability .",
    "they advocated using the free - particle schrdinger equation as the basis of a new approximation scheme - the _ free - particle approximation_. the free - particle approximation is essentially an alternative to the adhesion model in which the viscosity term is replaced by a non - linear term known as the _ quantum pressure _ ; it is this term that prevents the formation of caustics .",
    "a convenient property of the free - particle schrdinger equation is that , like burgers equation , it possesses an analytic solution .",
    "short and coles @xcite used the free - particle method to follow the gravitational evolution of a plane - symmetric sinusoidal density fluctuation until shell - crossing . by considering such a simple example",
    "they were able to carefully elucidate the effect of the quantum pressure term .",
    "it was found that , if not properly controlled , the quantum pressure term significantly impedes the growth of density perturbations .",
    "however , in the case where the effect of this unusual term was minimized , the free - particle approximation provided an excellent match to the zeldovich approximation ( which is exact in one - dimension up until particle trajectories intersect ) and was capable of generating large ( non - linear ) over - densities .",
    "our objective in this paper is to provide the first comprehensive test of this promising new method in a cosmologically relevant scenario by appealing to a full @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "we also assess the performance of the free - particle approximation relative to the established linearized fluid approach and the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section [ fpsect ] we present the central equations of the free - particle approximation and comment on the link between the free - particle , adhesion and zeldovich approximations .",
    "the essentials of the practical implementation of the free - particle method are discussed in section [ testfull ] . in section [ res ]",
    "we describe the results of our comparison of the free - particle approximation with an @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "in the free - particle approximation , collisionless cdm is represented by a complex scalar field @xmath2 obeying the free - particle schrdinger equation    @xmath3    where the amplitude and phase of the wavefunction are related via    @xmath4 + \\frac{1}{d}\\left(|\\psi|^{2}-1\\right)=0,\\ ] ]    and the effective planck constant @xmath1 is a free ( real ) parameter with dimensions of @xmath5 . for a full derivation of these equations and a discussion of the validity of the free - particle approximation",

    "the spatial coordinates @xmath6 are comoving coordinates and we use the linear growth factor @xmath7 as a ` time ' variable , rather than cosmological proper time @xmath8 . the linear growth factor is the growing mode solution of the differential equation    @xmath9    where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath8 and , at some initial time @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 , where the scale factor @xmath14 is normalized to unity at the present epoch , and @xmath15 is the density of cdm in a homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker background cosmology .",

    "on the other hand , replacing @xmath30 by a term of the form @xmath31 leads to burgers equation @xcite for the case of an irrotational velocity field ; this is the defining equation of the adhesion model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the term @xmath31 prevents the formation of multi - stream regions and regularizes the density singularities predicted by the zeldovich approximation .",
    "it is controlled by the ( real ) parameter @xmath32 which formally plays the role of a viscosity coefficient in the adhesion approximation .",
    "the growth of density perturbations is suppressed on scales @xmath33 by the viscous term and thus , for large values of @xmath32 , the adhesion model leads to a much smoother distribution of matter than observed in @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to maximize the dynamic range of the adhesion approximation , the ( inviscid ) limit @xmath34",
    "is commonly employed ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this limit",

    "the euler - jeans - newton model @xcite and the small - size expansion @xcite ) where burgers equation is consistently _ derived _ ( rather than _ assumed _ ) , the constant viscosity coefficient @xmath32 is replaced by a density - dependent _ gravitational multi - stream coefficient _ ( see @xcite and references therein for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the quantum pressure term @xmath30 can not be written in a form proportional to @xmath35 and so the free - particle and adhesion approximations are not equivalent . however",
    ", the quantum pressure term does play a qualitatively similar role to the viscous term in the sense that it is also a regularizing term , preventing the formation of multi - stream regions and caustics .",
    "this was demonstrated by coles and spencer @xcite who used the schrdinger equation to follow the evolution of a one - dimensional sinusoidal density fluctuation beyond shell - crossing .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 controls the quantum pressure term in the same way that @xmath32 controls the viscous term and , like @xmath32 , @xmath1 can also be viewed as an approximation to a general gravitational multi - stream coefficient .",
    "short and coles @xcite showed that , in the semi - classical limit @xmath36 , the free - particle approximation reduces exactly to the zeldovich approximation prior to shell - crossing .",
    "the quantum pressure term then only becomes important in regions where particle trajectories intersect .",
    "however , for finite @xmath1 , the quantum pressure term has an effect before shell - crossing occurs and acts to inhibit the gravitational collapse of density perturbations .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath1 , the greater the suppression effect ; see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "the free - particle approximation is then no longer identical to the zeldovich approximation , although they may become similar at a certain distance from collapsing regions , depending on the actual value of @xmath1 .",
    "also , once shell - crossing occurs , the quantum pressure term has an effect outside of multi - stream regions in the finite @xmath1 case ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "in modern cosmology the process of large - scale structure formation is almost exclusively studied using numerical @xmath0-body methods since these techniques allow the gravitational evolution of density perturbations to be followed far into the non - linear regime .",
    "this is something that can not be done with any analytical approximation . as a result",
    ", @xmath0-body simulations provide an ideal tool for testing the applicability of analytical approximation schemes . in this paper",
    "we test the free - particle approximation , the linearized fluid approach and the zeldovich approximation in eulerian space ( which we henceforth refer to as the zeldovich - bernoulli approximation ) against an @xmath0-body simulation so that we may assess the performance of the new free - particle approximation relative to existing methods .",

    "the value of @xmath109 is mesh - dependent and , in the work presented here , @xmath110 . to illustrate that @xmath111 is indeed the optimal case",
    ", we compare the relative sizes of the quantum pressure @xmath30 and convective @xmath112 terms in the bernoulli equation ( [ fpbern ] ) for several different choices of @xmath101 .",
    "we do this by introducing a ratio @xmath113 , defined by @xmath114 . for each value of @xmath101",
    "we also investigate how the quantum pressure term affects the formation of large - scale structure within the free - particle approximation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows how the ratio @xmath115 evolves with the scale factor . for the moment we focus on the three solid lines , corresponding to @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "observe that the ratio @xmath115 increases monotonically with the scale factor in all cases , implying that , on average , the quantum pressure grows relative to the convective term as time proceeds .",
    "we can also see that , at any particular value of the scale factor , the value of @xmath115 decreases as @xmath101 is decreased .",
    "therefore , on average , the quantum pressure term becomes less significant ( relative to the convective term ) as the value of @xmath101 is made smaller . at each value of the scale factor",
    ", we find that the smallest value of @xmath115 is indeed obtained for @xmath119 . for reasons that will become clear in section [ comp ]",
    ", we also examine the behaviour of @xmath115 when the free - particle density field is smoothed with a gaussian filter prior to calculating the quantum pressure and convective terms ( note that we apply the smoothing first to ensure numerical gradients are well behaved ) . the dashed and dotted lines in figure [ fig1 ]",

    "however , the over - densities formed in the free - particle approximation are not as large as in the @xmath0-body simulation and the free - particle density field is considerably smoother than the @xmath0-body density field .",
    "this is not surprising since the free - particle approximation is essentially a quasi - linear method and thus can not account for the full non - linear growth of density perturbations . as the value of @xmath101 is increased to @xmath123 the pattern of large - scale structure appears ` smeared out ' in the free - particle approximation .",
    "this is because the quantum pressure term is now larger on average ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) and inhibits the collapse of density perturbations over a greater distance ; see also @xcite .",
    "similar behaviour is also seen in the adhesion approximation as the viscosity parameter @xmath32 is increased @xcite . in the case where @xmath118 , the quantum pressure term completely dominates the convective term on average ( figure [ fig1 ] ) and there is no growth of density fluctuations whatsoever .",
    "instead , the initial density field simply oscillates rapidly in a seemingly random fashion and remains close to homogeneous .",

    "this explains why the free - particle density field provides the best match to the @xmath0-body density field in low density regions .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig3 ] that , even after applying smoothing , all of the approximation methods systematically underestimate the density in high - density regions .",

    "consequently , the performance of all the approximation methods is improved . however , the free - particle approximation still clearly out - performs the linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations .",
    "the correlation between the smoothed free - particle and @xmath0-body density fields is very good at all values of the scale factor , with only a slight discrepancy between the two density fields in high - density regions as @xmath131 . although the smoothing is now much heavier , the linearized fluid approach and the zeldovich - bernoulli approximation still generate negative matter densities at late times .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath132 provides a simple way of quantifying the scatter about the diagonal in the point - by - point comparisons of figure [ fig3 ] and figure [ fig4 ] . in figure [ fig5 ] we explicitly plot @xmath132 as a function of the scale factor for each approximation scheme .",
    "results are shown for the two smoothing scales : @xmath120 mpc and @xmath121 mpc .",
    "it is immediately clear that , for both smoothing lengths , the free - particle approximation consistently yields a higher value of @xmath132 than the other two methods .",
    "it is interesting to note that , when the free - particle density field is smoothed with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath133 mpc , the value of @xmath132 obtained is always larger than that calculated from the linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli density fields smoothed on a scale of @xmath134 mpc .",
    "in other words , even when the linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli density fields are more heavily smoothed , the correlation with the @xmath0-body density field is still not as good .",
    "a simple means of examining the statistical properties of the density fields in the different approximation schemes is afforded by the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath135 of the density fields .",
    "the pdf of the initial @xmath0-body density field is gaussian by construction .",
    "however , non - linear gravitational evolution causes the @xmath0-body pdf to become non - gaussian at late times .",
    "the distribution becomes skewed since positive density fluctuations ( over - densities ) can grow indefinitely whereas negative density fluctuations ( under - densities ) can not exceed @xmath136 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the pdfs of the various density fields at the final time @xmath122 for the smoothing lengths @xmath120 mpc and @xmath121 mpc .",
    "the corresponding pdfs of the @xmath0-body density field are shown for reference .",
    "we can see that , for both smoothing scales , the pdf of the free - particle density field provides the best match to the @xmath0-body pdf for all values of @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that the free - particle approximation guarantees @xmath137 causes the free - particle pdf to be skewed in the same way as the @xmath0-body pdf .",
    "it is clear from both plots in figure [ fig6 ] that the pdf of the linearized fluid density field is gaussian .",
    "this must be the case for gaussian initial conditions since the density contrast at a given point simply grows proportional to the linear growth factor to first - order in eulerian perturbation theory .",
    "the pdfs of the zeldovich - bernoulli density field also seem to be close to gaussian .",
    "consequently , the linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations both assign a non - zero probability to the existence of regions with @xmath138 at late times .    in our discussion",
    "so far we have only compared the performance of the free - particle , linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations in real space .",
    "however , it is informative to examine the behaviour of the different approximation schemes in fourier space as well . for each method",
    "we investigate how the fourier components @xmath139 of the appropriate density field evolve relative to the corresponding fourier components @xmath140 of the @xmath0-body density field . to do this we use the statistic @xmath141 , defined by    @xmath142    where , for each ( comoving ) wavenumber @xmath143 , the summations are over all wavevectors @xmath88 with a magnitude in the interval @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath145 provides a measure of the differences between the amplitudes and phases of the fourier components @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "if the amplitudes and phases of the fourier components of the two fields are identical then @xmath148 . on the contrary ,",
    "if the phases of the two fields are completely uncorrelated then @xmath149 on average .",
    "a convenient property of the statistic @xmath145 is that it is independent of any smoothing of the density fields and so we are free to use the un - smoothed density fields to calculate @xmath145 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows @xmath145 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath143 at the final time @xmath122 for the different approximation schemes we are considering .",
    "the vertical dashed line shown in the plot denotes the wavenumber @xmath150 mpc@xmath43 which corresponds to a wavelength of @xmath151 mpc . from observations , the present rms density fluctuation in spheres of diameter",
    "@xmath152 is of order unity and so the scale @xmath153 can be taken as an indication of the boundary between modes in the linear and non - linear regimes of gravitational evolution .",
    "fourier modes with a wavenumber @xmath154 are still in the linear regime and evolve independently of each other .",
    "the phase information of the initial density field is preserved in this case . on the other hand , modes with a wavenumber @xmath155 experience phase shifts due to coupling between different modes in the non - linear regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig7 ] that , for all of the approximation schemes , the value of @xmath145 becomes larger as @xmath143 is increased .",
    "this is not surprising since the various methods we are comparing can not accurately follow the non - linear evolution of small - scale modes .",
    "the main point of figure [ fig7 ] is that , for wavenumbers in the range @xmath156 , the value of @xmath145 is consistently smaller in the free - particle approximation than in the linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations .",
    "in particular , the free - particle approximation performs much better than the other two methods for @xmath157 .",
    "notice that the zeldovich - bernoulli approximation gives a slightly lower value of @xmath145 than the free - particle approximation for @xmath158 .",
    "however , the wavenumber @xmath159 corresponds to a wavelength @xmath160 mpc and we find that the rms density fluctuation in spheres of diameter @xmath161 is approximately @xmath162 for the final @xmath0-body density field .",
    "thus we can not realistically expect the free - particle and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations to yield reliable results on scales much smaller than this anyway .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a new approach to the study of cosmological structure formation known as the free - particle approximation .",
    "the free - particle approximation is similar in spirit to the adhesion approximation in the sense that it is an extension of the zeldovich approximation which includes a regularizing term - the quantum pressure term - to prevent the formation of density singularities when shell - crossing occurs .",
    "the quantum pressure is controlled by a free parameter @xmath1 ( or @xmath101 in the notation of section [ res ] ) which is akin to the viscosity coefficient @xmath32 in the adhesion model . in the semi - classical limit",
    "@xmath163 the quantum pressure only has an effect in multi - stream regions .",
    "however , in this work we have employed a numerical implementation of the free - particle approximation that uses a finite value of @xmath1 instead . in this case",
    "the quantum pressure term acts to suppress the collapse of density perturbations away from regions where particle trajectories cross ; the degree of suppression increases with @xmath1 .",
    "the free - particle method has been rigorously tested by appealing to a full cosmological @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "we have shown that the performance of the free - particle approximation , relative to the @xmath0-body simulation , is optimized when @xmath1 is set to the smallest possible value @xmath164 supported by the discrete mesh we use . in this case",
    "the effect of the quantum pressure is minimal . for larger values of @xmath165",
    "the quantum pressure term becomes more significant relative to the convective term in ( [ fpbern ] ) and the details of the large - scale structure distribution appear ` washed out ' in the free - particle approximation .",
    "in particular , for @xmath166 , the quantum pressure term is dominant and initial density fluctuations undergo oscillation rather than growth . the free - particle approximation ( with @xmath167 ) consistently yields better results than the established linearized fluid and zeldovich - bernoulli approximations in all of the tests discussed in section [ res ] . at all times",
    "the density field obtained from the free - particle method is considerably better correlated with the @xmath0-body density field than the density fields of the other two approximation schemes .",
    "this is particularly true in low density regions which is a consequence of the fact that the free - particle density field is guaranteed to be non - negative .",
    "this feature of the free - particle approximation also explains why the one - point pdf of the free - particle density field provides the closest match to the @xmath0-body pdf of all the approximation methods .",
    "we have also seen that the free - particle approximation out - performs the linearized fluid approach and the zeldovich - bernoulli approximation in fourier space . from a practical point of view",
    ", another advantage of the free - particle approximation is that it is very quick to implement .",
    "this is because the free - particle schrdinger equation has an exact solution , allowing us to directly calculate the density and velocity fields at any given time without having to numerically integrate equations of motion .",
    "to conclude , the free - particle approximation provides a quick and effective way of evolving cosmological density perturbations into the quasi - linear regime in any cdm - dominated cosmology .",
    "we have compared the free - particle method with two traditional approaches and the results have proved favourable . in light of these comments , we believe that the free - particle approximation provides another useful addition to the repertoire of analytical techniques available for the study of large - scale structure formation .",
    "c j short would like to thank pparc for the award of a studentship that made this work possible .",
    "also , we are grateful to f r pearce for many useful comments regarding numerical issues and to the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
