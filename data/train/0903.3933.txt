    "since the pioneering work in quantum cosmology due to dewitt @xcite , many physicists have worked in this theory .",
    "the main motivation behind quantum cosmology is a consistent explanation for the origin of our universe .",
    "so far , the most appealing explanation is the spontaneous _ creation from nothing _ @xcite . in that picture for the origin of the universe ,",
    "the universe is a quantum mechanical system with zero size .",
    "there is a potential barrier that the universe may tunnel with a well - defined , non - zero probability .",
    "if the universe actually tunnels , it emerges to the right of the barrier with a definite size .",
    "the application of the _ creation from nothing _ idea in minisuperspace models has led to several important results .",
    "the wave - function of the universe satisfies the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to specify boundary conditions in order to solve that equation and find a unique and well - defined wave function .",
    "the motivation to obtain a wave - function that represents the _ creation from nothing _ has led to the introduction of at least three proposals for the boundary conditions for the wave - function of the universe @xcite .",
    "the inflationary period of the universe appears very naturally from the _ creation from nothing _ idea .",
    "that is the case because most of the minisuperspace models considered so far have a potential that decreases , without a limit , to the right of the barrier .",
    "it gives rise to a period of unbounded expansion which is interpreted as the inflationary period of the universe @xcite .",
    "also , it was shown by several authors that an open inflationary universe may be created from nothing , in theories of a single scalar field for generic potentials @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the particle content in the universe originated during the _ creation from nothing _",
    "process @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we study the quantum cosmology description of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models in the presence of a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) and a generic perfect fluid .",
    "the spatial sections of the models have positive curvature .",
    "the perfect fluid has an equation of state of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the fluid pressure and density , and @xmath4 is a constant in the range @xmath5 . in the present quantum cosmology description , the perfect fluid",
    "is treated by means of the variational formalism developed by schutz @xcite .",
    "the treatment of a simpler model which differs from ours by the lack of a cosmological constant was first done in @xcite .",
    "the schutz s variational formalism , applied to the present model , leads to a superhamiltonian which , after the canonical quantization , produces a wheeler - dewitt equation with operator ordering ambiguities .",
    "more precisely , the canonically conjugated momentum to the scale factor ( @xmath6 ) appears in the superhamiltonian coupled to a function of the scale factor ( @xmath7 ) . in the present work we propose a general canonical transformation in order to eliminate these operator ordering ambiguities",
    ". as we shall see , the resulting wheeler - dewitt equation in the new variables will be much simpler than the initial one .",
    "in fact , there is already in the literature a particular example of such canonical transformation @xcite .",
    "there , the authors considered a flat frw geometry coupled to a dust perfect fluid ( @xmath8 ) and a cosmological constant .",
    "after the application of schutz s variational formalism and the particular canonical transformation , the wheeler - dewitt equation in the new variables was reduced to a schrdinger equation for a harmonic oscillator when @xmath9 and for an inverted harmonic oscillator when @xmath10 .",
    "although the authors of @xcite state that the transformation they used is canonical , they did not prove it .",
    "here , we prove that the transformation leading from the scale factor and its canonically conjugated momentum to a new set of canonically conjugated variables , such that in the new variables the resulting wheeler - dewitt equation is free from operator ordering ambiguities , is indeed canonical . in order to prove that the transformation is canonical",
    "we shall demonstrate that the dirac and poisson brackets of the new canonical variables are the same .",
    "it will be done following the symplectic framework @xcite .",
    "then , we shall give a further example , than the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite , on how these transformations simplify the wheeler - dewitt equation of these models .",
    "we shall consider a closed frw model coupled to a dust perfect fluid and a positive cosmological constant .",
    "finally , we compare the results for the present model with the ones for another model already treated in the literature @xcite where the only difference is the presence of a radiative perfect fluid , instead of dust .    in the next section ,",
    "we write the superhamiltonian constraint in terms of the scale factor , the variable associated to the perfect fluid and their conjugated momenta . then , the superhamiltonian term which will lead to operator ordering ambiguities , after the quantization , will be easily seen .",
    "after that , we introduce the transformations leading to new pairs of canonical variables such that the new quantum theory is free from operator ordering ambiguities .",
    "next , we demonstrate that the dirac brackets of the new canonical variables are equal to their corresponding poisson brackets , which confirms that the transformations , leading from the old variables to the new ones , are canonical",
    ". this will be done following the symplectic framework @xcite . in section [ sec : quantum ] , we give an explicit example on how the canonical transformation simplifies the treatment of the model at the quantum level .",
    "we consider a specific example where the perfect fluid is dust ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we canonically quantize the model , written in terms of the new pair of canonically conjugated variables , and obtain the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "we solve it , numerically .",
    "for particular values of the dust energy and the cosmological constant , we plot the square modulus of the wave - function of the universe as a function of the scale factor .",
    "the tunneling process can be readily seen from the results .",
    "then , we evaluate the tunneling probability ( tp ) and its dependence on the dust energy .",
    "we obtain that the tp increases with the dust energy for a fixed cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , it is more probable that the classical evolution should start with the greatest possible value for the dust energy .",
    "finally , we compare the tunneling probability obtained here with the one obtained for a model where the perfect fluid is radiative ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the tunneling probability of the universe with dust is greater than the universe with radiation .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main points and results of our paper .",
    "the closed friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological models are characterized by the scale factor @xmath12 and have the following line element ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the line element of the two - dimensional sphere with unitary radius , @xmath15 is the lapse function and we are using the natural unit system , where @xmath16 .",
    "the matter content of the model is represented by a perfect fluid with four - velocity @xmath17 in the comoving coordinate system used and a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "einstein s equations for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) and the energy momentum tensor ( [ 2 ] ) are equivalent to the hamilton equations generated by a total hamiltonian . in order to get this hamiltonian , the symplectic method will be applied in a seminal lagrangian that describes the dynamics of the system ,    @xmath19 ^ 4 e^{-3b},\\ ] ]    which is an extended formulation of schutz s lagrangian , since the @xmath4 parameter was introduced into the model . calculating the canonical momenta ,",

    "the symplectic variables are and the one - form momenta @xmath26 are given by    @xmath27    the corresponding symplectic matrix , defined as    @xmath28    reads    @xmath29    this matrix is singular , so it has a zero - mode ,    @xmath30    following the symplectic method , if one contracts the zero - mode with the symplectic potential gradient one should find zero . otherwise , a constraint is obtained .",

    "the symmetry must be fixed .",
    "this is done in the symplectic process introducing the gauge fixing term into the original first - order lagrangian , eq.([b0040 ] ) , through a lagrange multiplier , @xmath39 ,    @xmath40    where the gauge fixing term is    @xmath41    the symplectic variables are , now , @xmath42 and the symplectic matrix is    @xmath43    this is a nonsingular matrix and , according to the symplectic process , its inverse allows us to get the dirac brackets ; the only non - vanishing brackets are    @xmath44    the symplectic potential is identified as being the hamiltonian , so    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the momenta",

    "this is the total hamiltonian that generates hamilton s equations equivalent to einstein s equations for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) and the energy - momentum tensor ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "since a quantization process will be applied , the first term in the total hamiltonian ( [ b00190 ] ) poses an operator ordering ambiguity . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "the following transformation will be applied ,    @xmath49    due to this , the lagrangian density , eq.([b0000 ] ) , becomes    @xmath50 ^ 4 e^{-3b}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the transformation given in eq.([b0030 ] ) and with the aid of the momenta @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 computed from @xmath54 ( [ b0210 ] ) , the first - order lagrangian will become    @xmath55    where the symplectic potential is @xmath24 , with    @xmath56    after that , the symplectic method could be applied .",
    "the symplectic variables are now with the corresponding one - form momenta ,    @xmath57    computing the corresponding symplectic matrix , using eq.([b0060 ] ) , one finds that it has the following zero - mode ,    @xmath58    contracting this zero - mode with the symplectic potential gradient , a constraint is obtained , namely ,    @xmath59    this constraint will be introduced into the first - order lagrangian ( [ b0220 ] ) through a lagrange multiplier , @xmath33 , yielding    @xmath60    the symplectic variables are , now , @xmath61 and the respective symplectic matrix is singular with the following zero - mode ,    @xmath62    contracting this zero - mode with the gradient of the symplectic potential , we get    @xmath63    this constraint was obtained before and , in agreement with the symplectic method , the system has a gauge symmetry .",

    "the remaining brackets are all null .",
    "the symplectic potential is identified as being the hamiltonian , so    @xmath69    with    @xmath70    note that the hamiltonian above is a schrdinger - like equation with no operator ordering ambiguities .",
    "further , the dirac brackets are equal to the poisson brackets , allowing us to conclude that the variable transformation , eq.([b00200 ] ) , is a canonical transformation .",
    "in order to show the usefulness of transformation ( [ b00200 ] ) , let us consider a particular example .",
    "consider a model with closed frw geometry coupled to a dust perfect fluid ( @xmath71 ) and a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian , eq.([b00270 ] ) , reduces to    @xmath72    the model will be quantized following the dirac formalism for constrained systems @xcite .",
    "first we introduce a wave - function which depends on the canonical variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,    @xmath75    then , we impose the appropriate commutators between the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 and their respective conjugate momenta @xmath76 and @xmath77 . working in the schrdinger picture , the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 are simply multiplication operators , while their conjugate momenta are represented by the differential operators @xmath78    finally , we demand that the operator corresponding to @xmath79 annihilate the wave - function @xmath80 , which leads to wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath81 where the new variable @xmath82 has been introduced .",
    "the operator @xmath83 is self - adjoint @xcite with respect to the internal product ,    @xmath84    if the wave functions are restricted to the set of those satisfying either @xmath85 or @xmath86 , where the prime @xmath87 means the partial derivative with respect to @xmath88 . here",
    ", we consider wave functions satisfying the former type of boundary condition and we also demand that they vanish when @xmath89 .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 9 ] ) is a schrdinger equation for a potential with a barrier .",
    "we solve it numerically using a finite - difference procedure based on the crank - nicholson method @xcite , @xcite and implemented in the program gnu - octave .",
    "our choice of the crank - nicholson method is based on its recognized stability .",
    "the norm conservation is commonly used as a criterion to evaluate the reliability of the numerical calculations of the time evolution of wave functions . in references @xcite and @xcite , this criterion is used to show analytically that the crank - nicholson method is unconditionally stable . here , in order to evaluate the reliability of our algorithm , we have numerically calculated the norm of the wave packet for different times .",
    "the results thus obtained show that the norm is preserved .",
    "in fact , numerically one can only treat the _ tunneling from something _",
    "process , where one gives a initial wave function with a given mean energy , very concentrated in a region next to @xmath90 .",
    "that initial condition fixes an energy for the dust and the initial region where @xmath88 may take values .",
    "our choice for the initial wave function is the following normalized gaussian ,    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the dust energy .",
    "the wave - function @xmath93 is normalized by demanding that the integral of @xmath94 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 be equal to one and its mean energy be @xmath92 .",
    "after one gives the initial wave function , one leaves it evolve following the appropriate schrdinger equation until it reaches infinity in the @xmath88 direction .",
    "numerically , one has to fix the infinity at a finite value , let us call it @xmath97 .",
    "the general behavior of the solutions , when @xmath92 is smaller than the maximum value of the potential barrier , is an everywhere well - defined , finite , normalized wave packet . even in the limit of a vanishing scale factor . for small values of @xmath88",
    "the wave packet has great amplitudes and oscillates rapidly due to the interaction between the incident and reflected components .",
    "the transmitted component is an oscillatory wave packet that moves to the right and has a decreasing amplitude which goes to zero in the limit when @xmath88 goes to infinity . as an example",
    ", we solve eq .",

    ", we choose @xmath100 for the initial wave function eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) . for that energy ,",
    "we compute the points where it meets the potential barrier , the left ( @xmath101 ) and right ( @xmath102 ) turning points .",

    "it is important to mention that the particular choice of numerical values for @xmath0 and @xmath92 , above and in the following examples , were made simply for a better visualization of the different properties of the system .",
    "now , we compute the tunneling probability as the probability to find the scale factor of the universe to the right of the potential barrier . in the present situation ,",
    "this definition is given by the following expression @xcite ,    @xmath108    where , as we have mentioned above , the @xmath96 limit must be replaced by some suitably large value of @xmath88 , for the sake of numerical calculations .    since , by normalization , the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) is equal to the identity , @xmath109 is effectively given by the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "we consider , here , the dependence of tp on the energy @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , we compute @xmath109 for many different values of @xmath92 for a fixed @xmath0 . for all cases ,",
    "we consider the situation where @xmath92 is smaller than the maximum value of the potential barrier . from that numerical study",
    "we conclude that the tunneling probability grows with @xmath92 for a fixed @xmath0 . as an example , we consider @xmath99 values of the dust energy for a fixed @xmath98 . for this choice of @xmath0",
    "the potential barrier has its maximum value equal to @xmath99 . in order to study the tunneling process , we fix the mean energies of the various @xmath93 s in eq .",

    "therefore , it is more probable that the classical evolution should start with the greatest possible value for the dust energy .",

    "<S> in the present work , we study the quantum cosmology description of closed friedmann - robertson - walker models in the presence of a positive cosmological constant and a generic perfect fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the schutz s variational formalism . if one uses the scale factor and its canonically conjugated momentum as the phase space variables that describe the geometrical sector of these models , one obtains wheeler - dewitt equations with operator ordering ambiguities . in order to avoid those ambiguities and simplify the quantum treatment of the models , we introduce new phase space variables . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly demonstrate that the transformation leading from the old set of variables to the new one is canonical . in order to show that the above canonical transformations simplify the quantum treatment of those models , we consider a particular model where the perfect fluid is dust . we solve the wheeler - dewitt equation numerically using the crank - nicholson scheme and determine the time evolution of the initial wave function . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the results for the present model with the ones for another model where the only difference is the presence of a radiative perfect fluid , instead of dust . </S>"
