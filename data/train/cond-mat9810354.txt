    "the entire system is described by normalised probability distributions for single molecules , pairs of molecules , etc . ;",
    "thus @xmath11 is the probability that a molecule at position @xmath12 has polarisation @xmath13 and bias @xmath14 between states @xmath15 .",
    "the bias @xmath16 at @xmath17 sums the nuclear bias ( of typical energy scale @xmath18 ) , the dipolar bias @xmath19 ( typical energy scale @xmath20 ) , and any bias from external fields .",
    "this 1-particle distribution @xmath21 is connected to higher distributions @xmath22 , etc .",
    ", via a bbgky- style hierarchy of kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "since the only part of the environment with any dynamics at low t and low h ( ie . , able to mediate irreversible incoherent tunneling ) is the nuclear bath , the kinetic equation for @xmath21 is governed by a nuclear - mediated transition rate @xmath23 , calculated in @xcite . when the number of nuclear spins co - flipping with the molecular spin is small , @xmath24 where @xmath25 parametrises the range of fluctuations in @xmath16 , and @xmath26 ; typically @xmath27 .",
    "several unambiguous predictions @xcite flow from the kinetic equation . over a wide time range ( @xmath28 )",

    "we see why the square root prediction is valid independently of the details of the hyperfine couplings , the sample shape , or the ratio @xmath37 ; it arises from the ' ' lorentzian hole \" , eaten in the initial @xmath38 by the decay , coming from the long - range dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "1 shows a monte carlo simulation for a cube of size @xmath39 sites , and depicts @xmath38 when @xmath40 ( so @xmath41 ) , when @xmath42 has relaxed to 0.99 ; and the difference between the two .",

    ", @xmath47 directly measures @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath48 can be calculated numerically ( knowing @xmath49 , and the sample shape ) , this is a testable prediction .",
    "how `` universal '' is the square root law ?",
    "one potential problem , given that the ligand groups in such large molecules can be unstable , is rogue fast - relaxing `` impurity '' molecules .",
    "suppose the impurity concentration is @xmath50 .",
    "defining @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , for the bulk and impurity magnetisations , normalising @xmath53 , and assuming a ratio @xmath54 between impurity and bulk relaxation rates , one gets a short - time behaviour @xmath55\\ ; , \\label{imp-1}\\ ] ] @xmath56 \\ : .",
    "\\label{imp-2}\\ ] ] one easily verifies that for arbitrary @xmath57 , any appreciable impurity contribution to @xmath58 destroys square - root relaxation ( conversely , square - root relaxation only appears if the impurity contribution is negligible ) .",
    "the square root behaviour must also break down in the crossovers to long - time relaxation , and to thermal activation .",
    "after @xmath59 of the sample has relaxed , the lorentzian hole will distort because of intermolecular correlations .",
    "these are not because of multi - flip processes ( which have rate @xmath60 , and so are rare ) , but because factorisability of @xmath61 fails .",
    "however at long times other universal results emerge . _ first _ , if hyperfine spread in @xmath48 is strong ( ie .",
    ", when @xmath62 ) , then at times @xmath63 , the @xmath64 nuclear relaxation will sweep @xmath65 at any molecule over most of the range @xmath66 of @xmath67 ; one then gets @xcite @xmath68 , for @xmath69 . for weak hyperfine coupling ( @xmath70 ) , intermolecular correlations give a complicated quantum spin - glass problem , with no `` sweeping '' mechanism to wipe out these correlations .",
    "_ second _ , if we thermally recycle the sample , depolarising at high @xmath0 until @xmath71 , the remaining relaxation will be exponential , at a rate @xcite ( with @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 } \\ ; , \\label{taul}\\ ] ]    the quantum - thermal crossover is more subtle .",
    "the _ spin gap _ in the system is @xmath74 , between the lowest levels @xmath75 and the next 2 levels @xmath76 , and we expect that roughly @xmath77 ( in fact @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for mn-12 ( fe-8 ) respectively , whereas experimentally @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . as noted above , if @xmath82 , everything but the nuclear subsystem is frozen ( dipolar flip - flop processes to levels @xmath76 occur with frequency @xmath83 , where the coupling @xmath84 in these systems ; at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath85 ) used in the fe-8 experiments @xcite , the activation exponent was @xmath86 ! ! ) . in this case",
    "we expect square root relaxation ; and @xmath87 will only depend on temperature to the extent that @xmath88 does ( ie .",
    ", very little ) .",
    "however as one approaches @xmath2 , molecular flip - flops are more frequent .",
    "the square root prediction is not affected- but @xmath87 can develop a thermally - activated component , because ( a ) now dipolar field fluctuations can also bring molecules to resonance , and ( b ) by exciting nuclear @xmath64 transitions , they sweep the nuclear bias ( this mechanism will only be important for strong hyperfine interactions ) . a detailed theory of this is quite complicated @xcite .",
    "finally , in the very low-@xmath0 limit 2 things will happen ; the nuclear spins will polarise in the hyperfine field , for temperatures below the hyperfine coupling @xmath89 , and the nuclear @xmath88 fluctuations will freeze out ; and glass theory then predicts that a `` dipolar gap '' will open up in @xmath90 if @xmath91 .",
    "some of the predictions ( such as the square root law in the quantum regime ) have recently been found , in experiments on fe-8 and mn-12 single crystals @xcite .",
    "however there is still no _ direct _ proof for the controlling role of nuclear spins in the quantum dynamics of nanomagnets ; the observed @xmath92 relaxation clearly shows the role of dipole interactions , but the evidence for the nuclear role is indirect .",
    "how can it be seen directly ?    one obvious way is to do ac absorption experiments over a frequency range encompassing both @xmath93 and @xmath25 . in mn-12 and fe-8 , @xmath93 is perhaps @xmath94 , some 8 - 10 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath20 or @xmath18 ( which is why it is so astonishing that one sees very low @xmath0 relaxation at all ) ; we expect @xmath95 .",
    "this test is discussed by rose and stamp @xcite .",
    "a much more intriguing possibility would be available if nmr experimentalists could find resonance lines for some of the spin-5/2 mn nuclei in mn-12 ( the zero - field hyperfine coupling is probably @xmath96 600 mhz ( 450 mhz ) on the spin-2 ( 3/2 ) mn electronic sites respectively ) . at this point",
    "a `` david and goliath '' experiment becomes possible ; one `` tickles '' the nuclear spins at the resonance frequency , in order to control the relaxation of the giant magnetic molecules ( eg . retarding the relaxation by changing @xmath25 ) .",
    "another , probably more difficult experiment would `` freeze out '' the nuclear dynamics by cooling to @xmath97 ( ie , well below @xmath98 for mn-12 ) .",
    "the problem here is that of cooling the nuclei , since most of the heat transfer will involve the same @xmath88 fluctuations that we want to freeze out ! however there is a fundamental interest to doing this , since according to the theory these nuclear fluctuations are the last barrier to truly macroscopic coherent ( mqc ) behaviour in low-@xmath0 systems ( note that recent work @xcite indicates that nuclear and paramagnetic spins will make it very hard to see mqc even in _ superconductors _ ; spin baths tend to be far more damaging to mqc than oscillator baths @xcite ) .",
    "this , as well as the resulting `` quantum spin glass '' behaviour in the unpolarised limit , means that the low-@xmath0 limit promises much to the intrepid experimentalist !",
