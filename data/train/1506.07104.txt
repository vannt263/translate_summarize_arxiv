    "this paper is part of a long term program to prove the finiteness part of hilbert s 16th problem for quadratic vector fields , sometimes written @xmath4 , namely the existence of a uniform bound for the number of limit cycles of quadratic vector fields .",
    "the drr program ( see paper @xcite ) reduces this problem to proving that 121 graphics ( limit periodic sets ) have finite cyclicity inside quadratic vector fields , and the long term program is to prove the finite cyclicity of all these graphics .",
    "this program has been an opportunity to develop new more sophisticated methods for analyzing the finiteness of the number of limit cycles bifurcating from graphics in generic families of @xmath5 vector fields , in analytic families of vector fields , and in finite - parameter families of polynomial vector fields . in this paper , we focus on some graphics in the latter case : graphics through a nilpotent point and surrounding a center inside quadratic systems .",
    "the general method is to use the bautin trick , namely transforming a proof of finite cyclicity of a generic graphic into a proof of finite cyclicity of a graphic surrounding a center .",
    "this is possible in quadratic systems since the center conditions are well known : indeed all graphics through a nilpotent point and surrounding a center occur in the stratum of reversible systems .",
    "the systems of this stratum are symmetric with respect to an axis , and are also darboux integrable with an invariant line and an invariant conic . in practice ,",
    "the bautin trick consists in dividing a displacement map @xmath6 in a center ideal , i.e. in writing it as a finite sum of generalized monomials  times non vanishing functions of the form @xmath7 where each @xmath8 belongs to the center ideal in parameter space , @xmath9 is a generalized monomial in @xmath10 and @xmath11 behaves well under derivation .    to compute the displacement map ,",
    "we write it as a difference of compositions of regular transitions and dulac maps near the singular points .",
    "the dulac maps are calculated in @xmath12 normalizing coordinates for a family unfolding the vector field . in this paper , we develop some general additional methods , which allow to prove the finite cyclicity of the graphic @xmath0 ( figure  [ graphics](a ) ) . in particular , for the unfolding of this graphic , it is very helpful to be able to claim that all regular transitions are the identity in the center case .",
    "this is possible if we exploit the fact that the centers occur when the system is symmetric , and if we choose cleverly the sections on which the different transition maps are defined .",
    "also , in the center case , the dulac maps have a simple form since the system is darboux integrable .",
    "the methods can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we highlight that the change to @xmath12 normalizing coordinates in the neighborhood of the singular points on the blow - up locus can be done by an operator .",
    "this allows preserving the symmetry in the center case when changing to normalizing coordinates .",
    "* we introduce a uniform way of calculating the two types of dulac maps when entering the blow - up through a much shorter proof than the one given in @xcite . *",
    "although each dulac map is not @xmath12 , we can divide in the center ideal its difference to the corresponding dulac map in the integrable case . *",
    "the method of the blow - up of the family allows reducing the proof of finite cyclicity of the graphic to the proof that a certain number of limit periodic sets have finite cyclicity .",
    "these limit periodic sets are defined in the blown - up space .",
    "the ones obtained in blowing up a nilpotent saddle are shown in table  [ tab.shhconvex ] .",
    "for all of them but one ( the boundary limit periodic set ) , we can reduce the displacement map to a @xmath13-dimensional map , the number of zeros of which can be bounded by the bautin trick and a derivation - division algorithm on a map of type .",
    "the boundary limit periodic set is more challenging , since we need to work with a 2-dimensional displacement map , the zeros of which we must study along the leaves of an invariant foliation coming from the blow - up .",
    "we introduce a generalized derivation operator , which allows performing a derivation - division algorithm on functions of the type @xmath14 where @xmath15 are @xmath16-functions on monomials and @xmath9 are generalized monomials in @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( see definitions in appendix ii ) . during this process",
    ", we have to take into account that @xmath19 .",
    "we have a partial result for every graphic , but one ( namely @xmath20 ) , through a triple point at infinity :    [ thmain1 ] let us consider the graphics @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 through a triple point at infinity ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "then for any of them , the boundary periodic limit set obtained in the blowing up has a finite cyclicity .",
    "theorem [ thmain1 ] is not sufficient to prove that the given graphic has a finite cyclicity inside the family of quadratic vector fields .",
    "the reason is that , beside the boundary limit periodic set , other limit periodic sets ( see for instance table  [ tab.shhconvex ] for @xmath0 ) are obtained in the blowing up and , as explained above , we have to prove that each of them has also a finite cyclicity .",
    "we present here a complete result for the first graphic :    [ thmain2 ] the graphic @xmath21 has a finite cyclicity inside the family of quadratic vector fields .    as for the finite cyclicity of the other graphics @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", we intend to address the problem in the next future .",
    "the finite cyclicity of @xmath2 should be straightforward with arguments identical to those used for @xmath0 .",
    "it will be done simultaneously with the corresponding generic graphic @xmath24 . some of the limit periodic sets to be studied for",
    "@xmath1 will involve four dulac maps of second type .",
    "for these limit periodic sets , it is not possible to reduce the study of the cyclicity to a single equation .",
    "hence , new methods will need to be adapted to treat the center case , when the periodic solutions correspond to a system of two equations in the four variables @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "as for the graphic @xmath3 , some of the limit periodic sets to be studied involve four dulac maps of second type , two of them through the semi - hyperbolic points @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the blown - up sphere .",
    "the techniques developed in this paper can be adapted for studying the boundary limit periodic sets of graphics of the drr program through a nilpotent finite singular point .",
    "the only new difficulty in that case is to show that the three parameters of the leading terms in the displacement map do indeed generate the center ideal .",
    "we also hope to adapt them to study the boundary graphic of the hemicycle @xmath20 : there , the additional difficulty is the two semi - hyperbolic points along the equator .",
    "proofs of theorems [ thmain1 ] and [ thmain2 ] are given in section 3 and appendix ii , where the detailed computations of cyclicity are found in theorems [ thderdiv ] , [ thpgeq2 ] and [ thp1 ] .",
    "theorem [ thnormalformhyp ] in appendix i , gives a statement about normal form for 3-dimensional hyperbolic saddle points in a way adapted to this paper .",
    "theorem [ thtransgeneralhypsaddle ] of the same appendix gives a new proof for dulac transitions near these saddle points , shorter than the one given in @xcite .",
    "precise properties for the specific unfoldings deduced from the quadratic family are proved in appendix iii .",
    "these properties of some parameter functions are needed to obtain the results of finite cyclicity .",
    "we consider graphics through one singular point , which is a triple nilpotent point of saddle or elliptic type .",
    "a germ of vector field in the neighborhood of such a point has the form @xmath30 the saddle case corresponds to the plus sign , and the elliptic case to the minus sign with @xmath31 . in the elliptic case ,",
    "we limit ourselves here to the case @xmath32 , which corresponds geometrically to a nilpotent point with hyperbolic points on the divisor of the quasi - homogeneous blow - up .",
    "the unfolding of such points has been studied by dumortier , roussarie and sotomayor , @xcite , including a normal form for the unfolding of the family .",
    "a different normal form has been used in @xcite for studying the finite cyclicity of generic graphics through such singular points , when we limit ourselves to @xmath32 in the elliptic case .",
    "this normal form is particularly suitable for applications in quadratic vector fields , where there is always an invariant line through a nilpotent point of multiplicity @xmath33 .",
    "a germ of @xmath5 vector field in the neighborhood of a nilpotent point of multiplicity @xmath33 of saddle or elliptic type can be brought by an analytic change of coordinates to the form @xmath34 this requires an additional change of variable and scaling compared to what has been done in @xcite .",
    "the point is a nilpotent saddle when @xmath35 and a nilpotent elliptic point when @xmath36 ( see figure  [ fig.topotype ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "a generic unfolding depending on a multi - parameter @xmath40 has the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 are @xmath5 functions , and @xmath44 can be chosen of arbitrarily high order in @xmath45 .",
    "a _ graphic _ @xmath46 of a vector field @xmath47 , i.e. a union of trajectories and singular points , has _ finite cyclicity _ inside a family @xmath48 if there exists @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that any vector field @xmath48 with @xmath52 has at most @xmath53 periodic solutions at a hausdorff distance less than @xmath54 from @xmath46 .",
    "if a graphic has a finite cyclicity , its _ cyclicity _ is the minimum of such numbers @xmath53 .",
    "this means that when studying the finite cyclicity of a graphic @xmath46 , we need to find a uniform bound for the number of periodic solutions that can appear from it , for all values of the multi - parameter in a small neighborhood @xmath55 of the origin .",
    "typically we need to find a uniform bound for the number of fixed points of the poincar return map or , equivalently , for the number of zeros of some displacement map between two transversal sections to the graphic . with graphics containing a nilpotent singular point",
    "there is no way to make a uniform treatment for all @xmath56 , and we typically cover @xmath55 by a finite number of sectors , on each of which we give a uniform bound . the method for doing this is the _ blow - up of the family _ , which was first introduced in @xcite , and next applied to slow - fast systems in @xcite .",
    "we take the neighborhood of the origin in parameter - space of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a neighborhood of @xmath59 in @xmath60-space and we make the change of parameters @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 is compact .",
    "hence , to give an argument of finite cyclicity for the graphic @xmath46 , it suffices to find a neighborhood of each @xmath62 inside @xmath64 , a corresponding @xmath65 and a corresponding @xmath58 on which we can give a bound for the number of limit cycles . in our study , we will consider special values @xmath66 of @xmath67 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath68 depends on @xmath45 , and hence that @xmath69 is in some sense a parameter in itself .    the way to handle this program is to do a _ blow - up of the family .",
    "_ for this , we introduce the weighted blow - up of the singular point @xmath70 of the three - dimensional family of vector fields , obtained by adding the equation @xmath71 to .",
    "the blow - up transformation is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "the sections are 2-dimensional but , because of the invariant foliation , the problem can be reduced to a 1-dimensional problem and the conclusion follows by , either an iteration of rolle s theorem , or its generalization , namely a derivation - division argument .",
    "the technique can be adapted to non generic graphics occurring inside integrable systems : the proof in the generic case is transformed into a proof for the corresponding graphic , using some adequate division of the coefficients of the displacement map in the ideal of conditions for integrability .    to compute the displacement map , we decompose the related transition maps between sections into compositions of dulac maps in the neighborhood of the singular points and regular @xmath12 transitions elsewhere .",
