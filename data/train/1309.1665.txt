    "one of the main tasks of the lhc is the search for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles .",
    "these searches have been without success so far , and have lead to lower bounds in the tev range on the masses of gluinos and squarks of the first two generations .",
    "the trilepton channel @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and leptonic decays of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are considered as `` gold - plated '' for searches for charginos and neutralinos at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "corresponding searches at the lhc using leptonic final states , in particular trileptons plus missing transverse energy , have been performed by atlas and cms @xcite ; see @xcite for recent results from trilepton searches at @xmath9tev .",
    "there , the absence of significant excesses of events is interpreted in simplified models , motivated by the susy particle content of the minimal susy extension of the standard model ( mssm ) and assuming simple branching ratios and relations among masses .",
    "interpretations of the present constraints from the trilepton channel in realistic versions of the mssm have been performed in @xcite ( see @xcite for the rle of trilepton final states in some beyond - the - mssm models ) .",
    "a particularly challenging mssm scenario would be the case of light and nearly degenerate higgsinos @xcite .",
    "light higgsinos correspond to a relatively small ( @xmath10  gev ) susy higgs mass parameter @xmath11 , which is favored by fine - tuning arguments : @xmath12 appears always as a positive mass@xmath13 parameter in the higgs potential , and must be compensated by negative soft susy breaking higgs mass terms for electroweak symmetry breaking to be possible .",
    "this makes large values of @xmath11 unnatural , since then the required cancellation must be relatively very precise . on the other hand , a dominantly higgsino - like ( neutralino ) lsp is a difficult candidate for dark matter : its annihilation cross section in the early universe is typically too large so that , assuming a standard cosmological evolution , its relic density today is too small to comply with the wmap and planck result @xmath14 . moreover , its direct detection ( nucleon ) cross section is also too large @xcite in view of the latest xenon100 results @xcite unless the higgsino component is close to 100% .    in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , a susy higgs mass parameter @xmath15 is generated dynamically through the vacuum expactetion value ( vev ) of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the coupling of @xmath16 to the mssm - like higgs superfields .",
    "again , small values of @xmath15 are favored by low fine - tuning @xcite . however , the problems associated with a higgsino - like lsp in the mssm do not persist in the nmssm due to the presence of the additional neutralino ( singlino ) from the superfield @xmath16 , which can well be lighter than the higgsinos .",
    "this allows for a dominantly singlino - like lsp , whose annihilation cross section via higgs bosons in the s - channel ( and/or coannihilation or some higgsino component ) can lead to the desired relic density ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , and a sufficiently small direct detection cross section @xcite compatible with present xenon100 bounds .",
    "hence a scenario with light higgsinos and a light singlino , but heavy electroweak gauginos , is viable in the nmssm .",
    "assuming gut relations among the electroweak gauginos and the gluino , heavy electroweak gauginos would be an obvious consequence of lower bounds well above 1  tev on the gluino mass .",
    "since higgsino - singlino mixing would lift the degeneracy among the neutral and charged higgsinos and in the presence of a light singlino - like lsp , searches for charginos and neutralinos in the trilepton channel would be more promising than in the light higgsino scenario within the mssm @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that such a scenario would be complementary to the simplified models used by atlas and cms for the interpretation of the trilepton results up to now : in these models , the lightest chargino and the second lightest neutralino are assumed to be wino - like and degenerate , the lightest neutralino is assumed to be bino - like , and the higgsinos are assumed to be heavy and decoupled .",
    "the obvious reason for this choice is that now signal rates depend on only two mass parameters ( assuming 100% branching ratios into @xmath19 ) .    in the light higgsino - singlino scenario of the nmssm ( containing one chargino @xmath20 and 3 neutralinos @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 ) the masses and neutralino mixing angles depend on the higgsino mass parameter @xmath15 , the singlino mass , the ratio @xmath23 of higgs vevs and the coupling @xmath18 ( see the next section ) .",
    "the value of @xmath24  gev for the sm - like higgs mass can be obtained naturally in the nmssm provided @xmath18 is large ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath23 is relatively small ( @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath1 and @xmath2 , also the light higgsino - singlino scenario of the nmssm depends on two mass parameters only .",
    "these can be chosen as the physical chargino mass @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and the lsp mass @xmath29 , which have a more direct physical meaning than the higgsino and singlino mass parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "assuming heavy sleptons , the chargino @xmath20 decays with a branching ratio ( br ) of 100% into @xmath30 .",
    "the neutralinos @xmath31 will typically decay with a br of 100% into @xmath32 . in some cases",
    ", decays @xmath33 a cp - odd or cp - even higgs boson are possible .",
    "these depend on the masses and couplings of the higgs bosons .",
    "subsequently we define a simplified light higgsino - singlino scenario within which such neutralino - to - higgs decays are absent .",
    "then , given the above values of @xmath23 and @xmath18 , @xmath27 and @xmath29 determine completely the signal rates for chargino + neutralino production into trilepton final states .",
    "it would be very helpful if the atlas and cms collaborations would interpret their results from trilepton searches within such a light higgsino - singlino scenario , as it would allow to test a well motivated region in the parameter space of the nmssm .",
    "it also allows to generalize in a well defined manner the ( somewhat unrealistic ) assumption @xmath34 within the present simplified models , and to study the impact of the lift of this degeneracy .    in the present paper",
    "we present the necessary parameters for the determination of the @xmath35 production rates in the light higgsino - singlino scenario in the form of tables in the @xmath36 plane : the masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the two additional neutralinos , and the mixing angles of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( relevant for the @xmath41 couplings ) . as a ( preliminary ) application we simulated the trilepton event rates in the various signal channels defined in @xcite , and deduced bounds in the @xmath36 plane from the upper limits on the corresponding channel - specific signal cross sections based on 21  fb@xmath42 integrated luminosity at @xmath9  tev given there .",
    "the tables should allow the atlas and cms collaborations to perform more precise simulations ( in particular of the detector responses ) and comparisons with data themselves , notably with future data at larger @xmath43 and/or different signal channels .    in the next section",
    "we define the simplified light higgsino - singlino scenario in the nmssm , and comment on the tables given in the appendix . in section  3",
    "we describe the simulations of the trilepton final states and show the resulting bounds in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "section  4 is devoted to conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm due to the presence of the gauge singlet superfield  @xmath44 . in the simplest realisation of the nmssm , the susy @xmath45 higgs mass term in the mssm superpotential @xmath46",
    "is replaced by the coupling @xmath18 of @xmath44 to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and a self - coupling @xmath49 .",
    "here , @xmath47 couples to up - type quark superfields , and @xmath48 to down - type quark and lepton superfields . in this version",
    "the superpotential @xmath50 is scale invariant , and given by : [ eq:1 ] w _ = s h_uh_d + s^3 +  where the dots denote the yukawa couplings of @xmath47 and @xmath48 to the quarks and leptons as in the mssm .",

    "the vevs @xmath56 and @xmath57 of @xmath47 and @xmath48 generate mixing terms between the singlino @xmath58 and @xmath55 , @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the second term in the superpotential @xmath50 generates a majorana mass term @xmath59 for @xmath58 with [ eq:3 ] m_s = 2 s _ .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms include , amongst others , mass terms for the gauginos @xmath60 ( bino ) , @xmath61 ( winos ) and @xmath62 ( gluinos ) : [ eq:4 ] -l_= + .",
    "altogether the symmetric @xmath63 mass matrix @xmath64 in the neutralino sector in the basis @xmath65 is given by @xcite [ eq:5 ] m_0 = ( m_1 & 0 & - & & 0 + & m_2 & & - & 0 + & & 0 & - _ & -v_u + & & & 0 & -v_d + & & & & m_s ) leading to mass terms in the lagrangian of the form [ eq:6 ] l = - ( ^0)^t m_0 ( ^0 ) + .",

    "the dirac mass @xmath27 of the higgsino - like charginos @xmath20 is simply @xmath81 .",
    "the calculations of the masses and mixing angles as function of the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath82 ( which determines @xmath59 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath23 are performed with the help of the public code  @xcite . due to the radiative corrections to the pole masses ,",
    "@xmath27 differs slightly from @xmath52 . for the soft susy breaking squark and slepton masses",
    "we choose 2  tev , and @xmath83  tev , @xmath84  tev , @xmath85  tev .",
    "( these susy breaking parameters determine implicitely the susy breaking scale which has a mild impact on the radiative corrections . )    the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite have no impact on the neutralino / chargino sector .",
    "they can be chosen such that the sm - like higgs mass is near 125  gev ; in any case they must be chosen such that all physical higgs masses@xmath13 are positive .",
    "subsequently we consider @xmath27 in the range @xmath88  gev in steps of 20  gev .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath52 are tabulated in table  [ t : mu ] in the appendix .    for @xmath29",
    "we consider the range @xmath89  gev in steps of 10  gev . for fixed @xmath18 , @xmath23 and for each given @xmath52 , the desired values for @xmath29 can be obtained by suitable values of @xmath82 .",
    "actually , low values of @xmath29 require negative values for @xmath82 ( we recall that we assume @xmath90 ) . along a strip around @xmath91 , negative and positive values of @xmath82 ( of different absolute values )",
    "can lead to the same values of @xmath29 .",
    "we chose the convention @xmath92 whenever possible , which lifts this ambiguity .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath82 are tabulated in table  [ t : k ] in the appendix .",
    "note that @xmath93 (= 100  gev ) is not possible for @xmath94 as considered here , since even for @xmath95 mixing in the neutralino sector will always imply @xmath96 ( by at least 3  gev ) .",
    "now the masses and mixing angles of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are uniquely determined . in the tables",
    "[ t : m2 ] and [ t : m3 ] in the appendix we list @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the considered range of @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",

    "note that the last factor @xmath107 is absent in the coupling of @xmath108 to wino - like charginos and neutralinos ( not shown here ) ; as a consequence the production rates of higgsino - like charginos and neutralinos considered here are smaller than those of wino - like charginos and neutralinos assumed in the simplified models used by atlas and cms .",

    ".    given the decoupled winos and bino , the ( absolute values of ) the singlino components of @xmath113 , @xmath100 , are given by @xmath114 , and are typically quite small with the exception of @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( in the lower left - hand corner of the tables ) .",

    "assuming brs of 100% for the decays @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the masses and the @xmath41 vertices suffice to determine the production cross sections and signal rates into trilepton channels in this light higgsino - singlino scenario .",
    "hence this scenario is now well defined ( on the points given in the tables ) , and can be used to interpret results from searches for trileptons and missing energy . if desired , the parameters of additional points in the @xmath0 plane can be provided .",
    "recent results from searches for trileptons and missing energy at the lhc at @xmath9  tev and @xmath125  fb@xmath42 of integrated luminosity have been published in @xcite .",

    "in addition to the trilepton final state , the simplified higgsino - singlino scenario can also be tested in searches for four leptons plus @xmath153 @xcite .",
