    "galaxy cluster gas loses thermal energy copiously through x - ray emission . in the absence of energy input , radiative cooling in cores of clusters",
    "should result in substantial gas inflow ( see fabian 1994 for a review ) .",
    "these `` cooling flows '' would have associated mass deposition rates of several hundred @xmath3 in some clusters ( peres 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent high - resolution x - ray observations ( e.g. , peterson 2001 , 2003 ) have revealed that there is little evidence for the expected multi - phase gaseous structures , strongly suggesting that mass dropout is being prevented by some source that is heating the gas , thereby balancing radiative energy loss in the central region of clusters .",
    "recent work has focused on two prospective heating mechanisms : ( 1 ) diffusive heat transport , via thermal conduction ( ) and/or turbulent mixing ( ) , from hotter gas in the outer region to that in the core ; ( 2 ) energy input from jets , outflows , and radiation from a central active galactic nucleus ( ) .",
    "there is however at least one additional mechanism that appears to have been overlooked .",
    "it involves the energy lost by concentrated clumps of matter ( galaxies ) as they move through the cluster .",
    "part of this energy may go into re - arranging the dark - matter mass distribution ( el - zant 2003 ) , but a significant fraction should end up deposited in the gas . that dynamical - friction ( df ) coupling can transform the dynamical energy of galaxies into thermal motion in the gas has been known for at least four decades ( e.g. , dokuchaev 1964 ) .",
    "relatively recent work involving this notion includes the analysis by miller ( 1986 ) of the perseus cluster and that of just ( 1990 ) concerning the coma cluster .",
    "both studies confirm that , provided that the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies is @xmath4 , energy lost by galaxies to the gas should be sufficient in counteracting the radiative cooling of the gas in the central region of these clusters .",
    "several developments on the empirical side suggest renewed relevancy for this mechanism .",
    "one obvious one involves recent x - ray data confirming that a heating mechanism _ is _ required ; whereas the consensus in the 1980 s was against this conclusion , it now seems inescapable .",
    "the second involves revisions to the inferred gas electron densities in the central region of clusters ; best values referred to by miller and just are of the order of @xmath5 , while current best estimates are rather in the range of @xmath6 ( kaastra 2004 ) .",
    "this leads to an order - of - magnitude increase in the dynamical friction coupling between the galaxies and gas .",
    "there has also been progress in determining the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies . on the theoretical side , work by just ( 1990 ) and ostriker ( 1999 ) has since shed some light on the behavior of the dynamical - friction coupling in a gaseous medium in the transonic and subsonic regimes .",
    "there appears to be _ a priori _ no reason why the rate of energy loss from galaxies to gas via dynamical friction should be of the same order of that radiated by the gas .",
    "however , _ this coupling is active only when the sound speed of the gas is smaller than the typical velocity of galaxies_. the mechanism is therefore self - regulating ; the gas cools until the dynamical - friction heating rate is always equal to the cooling rate .",
    "we start by pointing out , in the next section , why this is expected to be so , before moving on to develop a monte - carlo model to estimate the total energy expected to flow into the cooling region of the perseus cluster , using recent data for galaxy luminosities and projected positions , as well as for the gas parameters of that cluster , and averaging over a set of different realizations where three - dimensional positions , velocities , and mass - to - light ratios are treated as stochastic quantities .",
    "the final section discusses briefly the central dark - matter distribution and energetics , as well as some remaining questions .",
    "the fundamental difference between the dynamics of collisionless and gaseous systems is the existence in the latter case of pressure gradients which communicate forces at the sound speed @xmath7 .",
    "if the galaxy velocity @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath7 then the gravitational interaction between a particle at impact parameter @xmath9 leading to dynamical friction is unaffected by pressure forces ( because by the time these are communicated to that region the galaxy is already at a distance @xmath10 ; e.g. , ruderman & spiegel 1971 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath11 , pressure forces can be communicated to the perturbed region _ before _ the minimum distance @xmath9 is achieved .",
    "the resulting pressure gradients ensure that the displacement of gas particles therein is hindered , and so the cumulative back reaction on the perturber that results in the dynamical - friction force is drastically reduced .    in the collisionless case ,",
    "when one speaks of a particle , one has in mind an actual material constituent . in the classic chandrasekhar formulation ,",
    "each of these contributes individually .",
    "the sum of the perturbations from particles moving faster than the perturber ( a galaxy ) is negligible for small particle mass ( being proportional to that mass ) . that from slower particles however results in a net contribution that for the massive perturber is independent of the smaller background - particle mass , and is always directed opposite to the perturber s motion .",
    "this results in the gradual decrease in the dynamical - friction force when the perturber velocity falls below that of the typical background particle . in the gaseous case",
    "however , unless the mean free path is larger than the impact parameter , collisions will lead to rapid decoherence of individual particle motion .",
    "a coherent effect that results in dynamical friction should then involve interactions between the perturber and gaseous elements instead of individual particles .",
    "if the bulk velocity , that is the macroscopic motion , of the gas elements is smaller than that of the perturber then all gas elements will contribute .",
    "the above considerations suggest that gaseous dynamical friction will follow the high - velocity approximation in a collisionless medium when @xmath12 and then drop sharply when @xmath11 .",
    "this conclusion was already reached , on the basis of steady - state perturbation theory ( ruderman & spiegel 1971 ; raphaeli & salpeter 1980 ) and was confirmed by two more sophisticated , but rather different , techniques invoking time dependence ( ostriker 1999 ) and fluctuation theory ( just 1990 ) .",
    "simulations by sanchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 1999 ) have shown broad agreement for particles moving on rectilinear trajectories and , more importantly , qualitatively confirmed the above conclusions in spherical systems ( sanchez - salcedo & brandenburg 2001 ) . for a perturber of mass @xmath13 , moving with @xmath12 we will thus assume that energy is lost at a rate given by @xmath14 and that the energy loss vanishes for @xmath11 .",
    "the relevant density @xmath15 is the typical gas density to be found within the cluster cooling radius @xmath16 , inside which the cooling time is less than a hubble time ",
    "that is , the region where heating must be invoked .",
    "if the galaxy is inside this radius , the range of impact parameters that contribute to heating should , to a first approximation , correspond to a minimal scale determined by the galaxy size and a maximal one determined by the cooling radius .",
    "for these galaxies therefore we take the coulomb logarithm to be @xmath17 , where the `` galaxy radius '' @xmath18 is set to 10 kpc  about twice the effective radius and disk scale length for ellipticals and spirals , respectively .",
    "galaxies outside @xmath16 should also contribute , but in this case the contribution from material inside @xmath16 to the energy lost by a galaxy at radius @xmath19 comes from impact parameters between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this contribution is also restricted from within an angle @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "replacing the minimal impact parameter with @xmath23 leads to an error of @xmath24 in the results .",
    "for galaxies outside @xmath16 therefore @xmath25 for galaxies on highly eccentric trajectories , the bulk of the energy exchange with gas inside the cooling radius takes place at closest approach to @xmath16 .",
    "however , corrections due to this effect are not large , even if most galaxies are indeed on nearly radial orbits . for any individual realization of such a highly anisotropic quasi ",
    "steady - state system , the dominant contribution to the energy input will come from those galaxies that are at small radii ( since both terms on the right hand side of  ( [ eq : barameters ] ) rapidly decrease when @xmath19 is appreciably larger than @xmath16 ) and are thus on their closest approach .",
    "because of the rather large energy input rate ( @xmath26 ) that is required to prevent a cooling flow , the perseus cluster is one of the more demanding cases for any cluster - heating model . in this section",
    "we examine whether , even in this case , energy dissipated from cluster galaxies can be sufficient to provide the required power .    brunzendorf & meusinger ( 1999 ) have collected a catalog of projected positions and apparent luminosities of 660 galaxies in the perseus cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] we plot the cumulative number of galaxies as a function of projected radius @xmath27 . as fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows , this can be fitted over a large range in radius by a distribution @xmath28 , which implies a projected density distribution @xmath29 .",
    "this in turn implies a three dimensional density varying as @xmath30 . in this case , along the line of sight , and at any given @xmath27 , the number density of galaxies decreases as @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) .",
    "this simple dependence of the number - density distribution on @xmath33 is consistent with the latter being distributed in such a way that @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is how the third spatial coordinate is chosen in the random realizations of the perseus cluster that we describe below .",
    "since the density does drop more sharply than @xmath37 at large radii , this prescription will slightly overestimate the @xmath33 values of coordinates .",
    "this is however a minor effect , since that region does not contain many galaxies and since most of the df comes from inner cluster galaxies ( and if anything leads to a decrease in the total df power pumped into @xmath16 ) .",
    "galactic extinction is particularly severe at the position of the perseus cluster in the sky .",
    "trials with the ned calculator show that corrections in the central region vary between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a value of about @xmath40 magnitude at the cd galaxy ngc 1275 ( which is not included in the df calculations ) . to all galaxies in the catalog",
    "we will apply an extinction correction of @xmath41 magnitude . to this one",
    "needs to add a k - correction that ranges from -0.092 for ellipticals to -0.02 for late type spirals .",
    "the apparent magnitude of disks are however further affected by inclination effects .",
    "these vary as @xmath42 , with @xmath43 ( assuming the axis ratio of the galaxy viewed edge on to be vanishingly small ) .",
    "this gives an average correction @xmath44 .",
    "we also apply a cosmological dimming correction of @xmath45 to all galaxies .",
    "absolute magnitudes are then obtained by assuming a distance to the perseus cluster of @xmath46 , compatible with a hubble parameter @xmath47  mpc with @xmath48 .",
    "unless the structural parameters defining the density distribution of elliptical galaxies vary significantly with mass , the faber - jackson relation and the virial theorem imply a luminosity - dependent central mass - to - light ratio : @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "gerhard ( 2001 ) have dynamically examined the central mass - to - light ratio of a sample of elliptical galaxies and determined that their results are in agreement with the assumption of structural homology , and that the variation of the mass - to - light ratio within an effective radius is largely due to change in stellar population . although trujillo ( 2004 ) have argued that non - homology effects may be important in determining @xmath51 ( which they deduce to be @xmath52 ) , a stellar mass - to - light variation with @xmath53 also appears to exist for disk galaxies ( salucci , ashman & persic 1991 ) .",
    "all these relations exhibit significant scatter .",
    "we adopt a zero - point mass - to - light ratio ( which we will refer to as `` stellar '' , even though the aforementioned papers do not exclude a modest dark - matter contribution in the inner regions ) consistent with these results and containing a stochastic component to represent the scatter .",
    "thus for a galaxy of luminosity @xmath54 we adopt @xmath55 where @xmath35 is a random variable chosen from a normal distribution with average of unity and dispersion @xmath56 .",
    "( the normalization is chosen by inspection of fig .",
    "13 of gerhard 2001 . )",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is expected to increase with radius , as the dark - matter contribution becomes progressively more important ( e.g. , gerhard 2001 ; takamiya & sofue 1999 ) . for galaxies confined in clusters , the contribution of dark matter at larger radii will depend on",
    "how much of the halo that should be surrounding the galaxy has been removed .",
    "this will in turn depend on the maximum excursion of that galaxy into the cluster center , and the density distributions of both the galaxy and the cluster .",
    "for example , a singular isothermal sphere with characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath57 moving through another isothermal system with dispersion @xmath58 , will be cut to a radius @xmath59 if @xmath60 is the minimum distance that the centers of the two spheres achieve . and",
    "so , in this approximation of the situation , an average galaxy halo ( velocity dispersion @xmath61 ) moving through the perseus cluster ( velocity dispersion @xmath62 ) , will have @xmath63 and the mass enclosed within this radius will be @xmath64 . since halos found in cosmological simulations have density profiles that are close to singular isothermal spheres over a large range in radii , this representation should be sufficient in approximating the initial conditions before any modification of these profiles takes place  provided that the density of the galactic halos is scaled in such a way that the mass in the very inner region is not dominated by the dark matter , so as to be in line with the aforementioned studies concerning the central mass - to - light ratios of galaxies .",
    "we will assume that the radial variation of the mass - to - light ratio of cluster galaxies is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is defined by equation ( [ eq : mls ] ) and @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the luminous mass ) defining a spatial scale over which enough dark matter remains tied to the galaxy for its contribution to the total mass to be comparable to the luminous one .",
    "statistically , @xmath70 will be determined by the velocity distribution of galaxies , with more anisotropic dispersions implying deeper entries into the cluster core and so more stripping .",
    "uncertainty in this parameter are represented by an additional appeal to another random variable @xmath71 again chosen from a normal distribution with mean unity and dispersion 0.7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlr ] we show the average mass - to - light ratio within a given radius for the perseus cluster averaged over @xmath72 realizations of the random variables @xmath35 and @xmath71 .",
    "another dynamical variable determining the gas - galaxies df coupling is the velocity distribution of the latter .",
    "brunzendorf & meusinger have only determined the line - of - sight speeds of 169 of the galaxies in their samples .",
    "the velocity dispersions of galaxies , when binned radially in groups of 20 to 30 , are @xmath73 @xmath74 with no obvious systematic variation incompatible with small - sample statistics . fig .",
    "[ fig : dfe ] shows the energy expected to be deposited via dynamical friction into @xmath16 , from galaxies enclosed within a radius @xmath19 , relative to the energy radiated from the cooling region , for different values of the radial scale @xmath0 . for each velocity component a normal distribution with zero mean and dispersion @xmath57 , such that @xmath75 , is assumed .",
    "results are shown for the 10,000 realizations of the cluster in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfe ] , assuming @xmath76 , and the total energy emitted from @xmath77 to be @xmath78 , consistent with the findings of kaastra ( 2004 ) , when converted to correspond to @xmath79 .",
    "the sound speed @xmath80 can also be read off table  5 of kaastra ( 2004 ) . excluding the very inner data point , which is probably influenced by central activity ( churazov 2003 ) , the central sound speed starts at about @xmath81 , eventually rising with radius to reach an asymptotic limit almost double that value , but remaining largely constant within most of the cooling region ( churazov fig .",
    "these studies also show the electron density to be slowly varying within @xmath16 , with values in the range @xmath82 ( there is also a factor of @xmath83 that should be included because we use @xmath48 , as opposed to the value @xmath84 used by these authors ) . in calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfe ] , a value of @xmath85 ( setting @xmath86 to convert electron densities into gas density ) and @xmath87 are used .    because of the sharp cutoff in the df - mediated coupling when @xmath88 , the amount of energy deposited into the gas must sensitively depend on the relative magnitude of the galaxy velocities and the sound speed when @xmath89 .",
    "the former is a function of the anisotropy of the distribution .",
    "for example , if galaxies move on nearly radial trajectories , their velocity dispersion would be closer to the line - of - sight value of 1200 @xmath74 , rather than 2000 @xmath74 as assumed above .",
    "the simulations of ghigna ( 2000 ) suggest that galaxies ( as represented by cluster subhalos ) may have biased velocity dispersion in the central region , perhaps reflecting enhanced radial motion ; whereas at larger radii they have velocity distributions that rather closely follow that of the dark matter .",
    "[ fig : anivel ] shows the power pumped into the gas relative to that radiated within the cooling radius of the perseus cluster , as predicted by our model , as a function of the sound speed for a range of fixed and ( radially ) varying @xmath90 values ( assuming @xmath91 ) for @xmath92 .",
    "it is rather remarkable that the competing effects of increased coupling at low velocities ( because of the @xmath93 dependence ) , and the rapidly decreasing number of galaxies contributing to the df with increasing @xmath7 , conspire to always ensure that a maximum value for the energy input is approached when @xmath94 , precisely the value attained in the ( central ) region where the temperature drops in the cluster .",
    "that dynamical - friction coupling between cluster galaxies and gas can significantly heat the latter component is not a new concept . indeed miller ( 1986 )",
    "has pointed out that a few luminous galaxies in the perseus cluster s central region may alone deposit sufficient energy to keep gas in that region from cooling , provided that they had a mass - to - light ratio of about 20 .",
    "we revisited this cluster using recently compiled galaxy and gas data and determinations of the mass - to - light ratios in galaxies .",
    "our monte carlo model shows that the rate at which energy is deposited by galaxies into the gas within the cooling radius can completely compensate for radiative loss from within that radius , if galaxies at radii @xmath95 kpc from the center of the cluster have dark mass that is comparable to their stellar mass ( with galaxies at smaller radii having progressively smaller dark - matter content , vanishing for those near the center of the cluster ) .",
    "the associated average mass - to - light ratio within this radius is about 10 .",
    "a robust and potentially important prediction of the model is that the drop in gas temperature invariably observed in the cooling regions of clusters is necessary for the df coupling to be sufficiently strong .",
    "there is a natural interpretation for this phenomenon : the gas cools until dynamical - friction heating becomes sufficiently efficient to prevent a further drop in temperature .",
    "the gas random motion is then coupled to that of the galaxies , and so remains in approximate equilibrium with it .",
    "all this simply follows from the fact that dynamical friction drops sharply for subsonic motion . in the case of the perseus cluster ,",
    "the transition from weak to strong coupling occurs precisely in the range of sound speeds found in the cooling core of the cluster .",
    "the action of the mechanism discussed in this paper also has consequences for the dark - matter distribution . as shown by el - zant ( 2003 )",
    ", dynamical friction from the galaxies will heat a density cusp , creating a core with radius corresponding to roughly a fifth of the original navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) scale length ( cf .",
    ", fig .  1 of el - zant et al .",
    ") , where dark matter has been spread out to larger radii ( fig .  3 of el - zant et al .",
    ") . approximating the initial density distribution in this region such that @xmath96 and the final one with @xmath97 , the energy required for this transformation is @xmath98 [ with @xmath99 . taking @xmath100 and @xmath101 to correspond to four times the value defined by the electron density @xmath102 ( where we have used the gas to gravitational mass ratio in table  5 of peres 1998 and equation ( 4 ) of churazov 2003 for the electron density )",
    ", one finds @xmath103 , which is comparable to the binding energy of the cd galaxy @xmath104 .",
    "it is however significantly smaller than the energy radiated from gas inside the cooling radius for the age of the cluster ( e.g. , for five gyr this amounts to @xmath105 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this energy is easily available from fast moving galaxies from beyond the very inner region  for example its value coincides with the kinetic energy in a mass similar to that of the cd galaxy and moving at @xmath106 , and that material can be supplied solely by the stellar mass of galaxies within @xmath107the region from which , according to our model , the bulk of energy input to the gas comes from .",
    "it is worth noting here that , under the circumstances just described , the mass of the gas within @xmath16 [ which using equation ( 4 ) of churazov 2003 , adjusted for @xmath48 with @xmath108 amounts to @xmath109 is comparable to that of the galaxies in that region . due to the temperature drop in the gas , thermal motions can be significantly smaller than that of the galaxies .",
    "the energy of the gas can therefore be smaller than that of the galaxies by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "there is therefore sufficient energy in galaxies to heat the gas many times over , with the crucial parameter , which was the focus of this paper , being the rate at which this is transferred .",
    "furthermore , once the dark matter in the center has been heated , it absorbs little additional energy from the galaxies , since dynamical friction does not act on fast particles , and the coupling with the dark matter at larger radii decreases rapidly with radius ( see el - zant 2003 for further discussion ) .",
    "the energy lost to the dark matter is therefore less than that going into keeping the gas at constant temperature .",
    "the mass of the cd galaxy , as well as the spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies in the central region of the cluster will reflect the history of energy loss to both components .",
    "several questions remain open .",
    "prominent among these is the issue of thermal stability . from the condition that thermal stability requires a remarkably narrow range of heating rates , bregman & david ( 1989 )",
    "have argued against miller s proposition that the perseus cluster gas is heated by df from galaxies .",
    "however the functional form of the heating rate used by these authors does not agree with later calculations that have been borne out by numerical studies ",
    ", their postulated form has a _ negative _ energy transfer rate ( @xmath110 ) for highly subsonic velocities , resulting in gas _ cooling _ , which is incompatible with the positive ( even if small ) heating found by just ( 1990 ) and ostriker ( 1999 ) in that limit",
    ". it will be therefore necessary to repeat these calculations using adequate forms for the heat - loss function .",
    "these calculations would also address another crucial question , that concerning the precise manner in which the energy lost by the galaxies is distributed in the gas . we have adopted the simple approach where this energy is deposited isotropically and equally in logarithmic intervals .",
    "this should approximate how the energy is initially deposited , at least for highly supersonic galaxies ( and since , in the cooling region , the sound speed may be several times smaller than the velocity dispersion , this may not be a very bad assumption ) . even then",
    ", however , the deposited energy may still be transported toward the center of the cluster by wave motions , as suggested , for example , by balbus & soker ( 1990 ) , and redistributed .",
    "we note here that the claim of these authors that df from galaxies is insufficient to heat the cluster core is based upon outdated values for the electron density and an outdated ( @xmath111 ) gas distribution . with updated values for the electron density and gas distribution ( e.g. , the empirical formula of churazov 2003 ) ,",
    "their conclusions are changed , as we have shown .",
    "we thus conclude that it is far from obvious that df - heating of cluster gas is irrelevant .",
    "the authors would like to thank m. c. begelman , e. bertschinger , p. goldreich , r. narayan , e. ostriker , n. scoville and r. sunyaev for helpful discussions and communications .",
