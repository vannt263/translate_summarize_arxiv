    "radio pulsars ( michel @xcite ) , superluminal galactic objects ( mirabel & rodriguez @xcite , @xcite ) and agns ( begelman , blandford & rees @xcite , pelletier et al .",
    "@xcite ) are observed to be associated with relativistic outflows .",
    "agns and superluminal galactic objects produce jets , while radio pulsars demonstrate a surprisingly high efficiency of transforming the pulsar rotational energy into kinetic energy of the relativistic wind ( kennel & coroniti @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the problem of acceleration and collimation of relativistic plasmas is among the most important in the physics of relativistic outflows .    nevertheless , radio pulsars , agns and superluminal galactic objects are objects of rather different nature and scales .",
    "it may well be that the mechanisms of acceleration of the outflows in these sources are not the same .",
    "however , there seems to exist a mechanism which operates very well for all these objects , namely , the so - called magnetocentrifugal acceleration where the acceleration of the plasma outflow occurs in the magnetic field of the rotating object .",
    "such conditions are realized in the magnetospheres of radio pulsars , in the winds from accretion disks ( blandford & payne @xcite ) and apparently in superluminal galactic objects ( mirabel & rodriguez @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has not been investigated whether the magnetocentrifugal mechanism could provide the acceleration of the relativistic plasma in these objects to the observed bulk motion velocities .",
    "the analysis of problem of the relativistic plasma acceleration and collimation in a rotating magnetosphere started with michel ( @xcite ) , where it was shown that the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of the plasma is not effective for a prescribed monopole - like magnetic field .",
    "subsequently , the relativistic plasma outflow has been investigated in several other studies and for different astrophysical conditions ( okamoto @xcite , ardavan @xcite , beskin et al .",
    "@xcite , camenzind @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the ultrarelativistic plasma outflow from an accretion disk was investigated numerically in camenzind ( @xcite ) while the structure of electromagnetically driven relativistic jets was discussed in li ( @xcite ) under the assumption of jet confinement by an ambient medium .",
    "collimation of stellar magnetospheres to jets in the force - free approximation was studied in sulkanen & lovelace ( @xcite ) and fendt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "later , fendt & camenzind ( @xcite ) investigated the plasma dynamics in the mhd approximation in magnetic configurations obtained via the force - free approximation .",
    "a class of self - similar solutions of the relativistic plasma outflow has been obtained in contopoulos ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the efficiency of the plasma acceleration can be higher than in michel s solution due to the effect of the magnetic collimation of the wind to the axis of rotation ( begelman & li ( @xcite ) , fendt & camenzind @xcite , takahashi & shibata ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "thus , the problem of the relativistic plasma acceleration in a rotating magnetic field appeared to be closely connected to the problem of plasma collimation .",
    "strong evidence has been accumulated for a correlation between collimated astrophysical outflows ( jets ) and accretion disks .",
    "direct evidence for a disk - jet connection has been demonstrated by hst observations of the herbig - haro object hh30 ( burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although on the theoretical front this connection was discussed earlier ( camenzind @xcite , ferreira & pelletier @xcite , falke & biermann @xcite ) .",
    "a disk - jet connection is also supported by observations of the active galaxy m87 ( ford et al .",
    "@xcite ) and superluminal galactic objects ( mirabel & rodriguez @xcite ) .",
    "these observations seem to lead to the conclusion that jets require the existence of accretion disks for their formation ( e.g. livio @xcite ) and therefore accretion disks should be a necessary element of the collimation mechanism . however , we have by now reliable evidence that there is at least one source producing jets without the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "namely , recent observations of the crab nebula by the chandra observatory leave no doubts that the crab pulsar indeed produces jets ( weiskopff et al .",
    "therefore , it would be important to understand the mechanism of plasma collimation in all known jet sources , including the crab pulsar .",
    "such a mechanism is provided by magnetic collimation of outflows from accretion disks and it was first suggested by lovelace ( @xcite ) , blandford ( @xcite ) and bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , it was shown from an analysis of the full set of the mhd equations for nonrelativistic ( heayvaerts & norman @xcite ) and relativistic outflows ( chiueh et al .",
    "@xcite , bogovalov @xcite ) that collimation is a rather general property of magnetised winds from a rotating object .",
    "a magnetised fast - mode supersonic wind inevitably will be partially cylindrically collimated along the axis of rotation at distances large compared to all characteristic dimensions of the source , such as the size of the accretion disk , provided that : the flow is non - dissipative , the magnetised central object is rotating , the total magnetic flux of one polarity reaching infinity ( open field lines ) is finite , the polytropic index of the plasma exceeds unity and the pressure of ambient matter is low enough not to be able to terminate the wind before the formation of the jet .",
    "this result is independent of the specific properties of the central source .",
    "collimation occurs spontaneously due to the internal lorentz force arising in the magnetised plasma which is ejected from the rotating source and therefore can be regarded as a process of self - collimation ( hereafter sc process ) .",
    "note that the assumption of a polytropic gas with a constant polytropic index @xmath5 does not seem really restrictive , since several exact mhd solutions for collimated outflows have been constructed for the case of a variable index @xmath5 , sauty & tsinganos ( 1994 ) , vlahakis & tsinganos ( 1998 ) .",
    "although the sc process has been questioned ( e.g. , okamoto @xcite ) , a numerical investigation of this process and the characteristics of jets produced via this mechanism in the cold ( bogovalov & tsinganos @xcite ) or hot ( tsinganos & bogovalov @xcite , sauty et al ( 1999 ) ) nonrelativistic winds leave no doubt that this mechanism works .",
    "this mechanism provides the formation of cylindrically collimated outflows at a large distance from the central source while collimation is accompanied by essentially more efficient acceleration of the plasma at the equatorial region as compared with the original study of michel ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for the focusing of mhd outflows from accretion disks to the axis of rotation at distances of the order of the dimension of accretion disks has been obtained in other studies as well , such as in ouyed & pudritz ( @xcite ) , ustyugova et.al .",
    "( @xcite ) and krasnopolskii et .",
    "( @xcite ) .    in the analysis of bogovalov & tsinganos ( 1999 ) , the relaxation method was used to obtain the solution of the steady state outflow problem , i.e. , the time - dependent problem was solved in order to get a steady - state solution .",
    "this method was first employed by washimi & shibata ( @xcite ) for outflows from stellar objects .",
    "later this method was applied in bogovalov ( 1996 ) for the investigation of the sc process in an initially monopole - like magnetic field .",
    "it seems that this numerical method allows us to solve accurately all problems connected with the critical surfaces ( bogovalov @xcite , tsinganos et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in our previous study ( bogovalov @xcite ) ,",
    "the relaxation method has been applied to the investigation of the relativistic plasma outflow and it was found that the relativistic plasma is very weakly collimated and accelerated even if the poynting flux dominates the matter energy flux at the equator .",
    "however , an analytical study performed in this work has shown that an efficient sc of the relativistic plasma is still possible for very fast rotation of the central source .",
    "recently it has been argued that a relativistic plasma is poorly accelerated even under this condition ( beskin et al .",
    "however , the sc process was totally neglected in this work .",
    "therefore , the question concerning the efficiency of the acceleration and sc of the relativistic winds from fast rotators remains open .",
    "outflows of magnetised plasmas are described by the system of the familiar nonlinear mhd equations .",
    "it is not surprising that this system has many solutions corresponding to different physical conditions .",
    "then , a reasonable choice of the appropriate approximation and a sound model is crucially important to arrive at some physically meaningful solution .    to formulate the basic demands of the model",
    "let us consider the general properties of winds and jets . according to observations , the length of the jets greatly exceeds all characteristic scales of the central source .",
    "therefore , for an investigation of the sc process and the characteristics of the jets , the theory should allow us to obtain the solution on scales greatly exceeding all sizes of the central source .",
    "observations of winds and jets from several classes of astrophysical objects such as our sun ( parker @xcite ) , or , yso s ( burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ) , pulsars ( kennel & coroniti @xcite ) and agns ( ferrari et al .",
    "@xcite ) show that they are super - magnetosonic at relatively large distances from the source . at the same time",
    "all winds must be subsonic near the central source where the basic parameters of the outflows are controlled .",
    "therefore , the theory must describe flows of mixed type , containing the small scale regions of a subsonic flow and the large scale regions of the super magnetosonic flow .",
    "the scales of these regions may differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "these properties of the outflows dictate the choice of the approximations and mathematical models .",
    "the force - free approximation has been widely used for the analysis of axisymmetric relativistic outflows ( scharlemann & wagoner @xcite , mestel & wang @xcite , beskin et al .",
    "@xcite , lyubarskii @xcite , fendt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for simplification reasons",
    ", the axisymmetric stellar magnetosphere can be assumed initially to have a dipolar magnetic field ( contopoulos et al.@xcite ) . however , this approximation is not appropriate for the investigation of the sc process for several reasons .",
    "for example , it describes only subsonic flows of plasma since the force - free transfield ( grad - shafranov ) equation is elliptic everywhere ( fendt et al .",
    "therefore , this approximation can not be used for the investigation of plasma outflow in the supersonic regions .",
    "moreover , the collimating and accelerating forces are equal to zero in this approximation . for these reasons ,",
    "the force - free approximation gives ambiguous results .",
    "for example , the structure of the flow of the relativistic plasma at large distances from the source obtained in sulkanen & lovelace @xcite and in fendt et al .",
    "@xcite differs from the structure obtained in contopoulos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . although sulkanen & lovelace ( @xcite ) and contopoulos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used similar models , contopoulos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained a radially outflowing plasma while sulkanen & lovelace ( @xcite ) obtained collimated jets .",
    "jets were obtained as well in fendt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "actually all these works are mathematically correct .",
    "the difference between them is only in the boundary conditions at infinity or at the outer boundary of the integration domain .",
    "these works clearly demonstrate that the flow of plasma at large distances from the source in the force - free approximation basically depends on the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "but there is no such dependence in real supersonic flows .",
    "this is the most important qualitative difference between the subsonic and super fast magnetosonic flows .    in the steady state",
    "subsonic flow the mhd signals propagate down and upstream of the flow .",
    "that is why the plasma flow is defined by the forces affecting the plasma at a given point , upstream and down stream of the flow .",
    "this is not the case in the super fast magnetosonic flow .",
    "no mhd signals can propagate upstream of the supersonic flow .",
    "the supersonic flow is defined only by the forces which affect the plasma upstream and at the given point and does not depend on the forces which affect the plasma downstream of the flow .",
    "for this reason the supersonic flow does not depend on the boundary conditions located downstream of the flow ( actually the situation is more complicated ; the flow should cross the fast mode critical surface , bogovalov @xcite ) . the simplest approximation which allows us to describe the mixed type outflows",
    "is the ideal mhd approximation .",
    "this approximation is used in this paper .",
    "however , even the use of the mhd approximation does not always allow us to investigate the sc process in the supersonic region .",
    "there is a wide class of self - similar solutions for the nonrelativistic ( blandford & payne @xcite , vlahakis & tsinganos @xcite e.g. ) and relativistic plasma ( contopoulos @xcite ) .",
    "all these solutions terminate not so far from the source .",
    "independent of why this termination happens , the self - similar solutions can not be used for the verification of the predictions of the sc theory since the central source has infinitely large size with infinite magnetic flux in the upper hemisphere . at any distance from the source ,",
    "the dimension of the source exceeds the distance to the source .",
    "however , we are interested in the opposite case , when the distance is large compared with the dimension of the central source . therefore , we demand that the appropriate model should have finite geometrical dimensions , finite magnetic flux of the open field lines of every polarity and initially uncollimated plasma outflow .",
    "the last condition is important for us since our objective is to study the process which transforms the initially uncollimated outflow into the outflow containing the jet .",
    "the word `` initially '' means that if one of the conditions for the sc process is not fulfilled ( for example if the central source is not rotating or the magnetic field is absent ) the wind expands radially at large distances from the source .",
    "actually , a lot of models satisfy all these conditions .",
    "the sc is a general property of magnetised winds from rotating sources .",
    "it must take place in a wind from any source provided that the conditions specified by heayvaerts & norman ( @xcite ) , chiueh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and bogovalov ( @xcite ) are fulfilled .",
    "therefore `` convenience '' and `` simplicity '' become reasonable arguments for the choice of the model for the investigation of this process .",
    "the model of a star with a wind in an initially monopole - like ( below m - l ) magnetic field firstly proposed by sakurai ( @xcite ) is the most simple and convenient .",
    "this model allows us to avoid the mathematically complicated problem connected with the coexistence of open and closed field lines near the source which actually has no direct relation to the sc process and usually is considered particular ( keppens & goedbloed @xcite ) .",
    "the model with the initially monopole - like magnetic field describes more a wider class of outflows , including the time - dependent outflows from oblique rotators ( bogovalov @xcite ) and outflows from objects with arbitrary distribution of the polarity of the magnetic field at the base ( tsinganos & bogovalov @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the outflow of an initially cold relativistic plasma and neglect only gravitation since we are interested in the effect of the electromagnetic forces only on the plasma .",
    "the plasma outflow from astrophysical objects consists of two zones where the properties of the flow differ qualitatively .",
    "the nearest zone is located near the surface of the central source and includes all the critical surfaces of the steady state flow ( bogovalov @xcite ) .",
    "the outer boundary of the nearest zone can be located rather arbitrary but always downstream of the fast mode critical surface .",
    "the flow of the plasma in the nearest zone is of the mixed type .",
    "it is subsonic near the source and is super fast magnetosonic at the outer boundary .",
    "the far zone is located downstream of the nearest zone .",
    "the plasma flow in the far zone is super fast magnetosonic .",
    "different methods should be applied for the solution of the problem in each of these zones .",
    "the solution of the problem of the steady state plasma outflow can be divided in two steps ( bogovalov & tsinganos @xcite ) . in the first step ,",
    "the problem is solved in the nearest zone by the relaxation method and in the second , the steady state solution in the far zone is obtained by solving directly the transfield equation as a cauchy problem .",
    "the solution in the nearest zone is used to specify the initial values for the flow in the far zone .",
    "the system of equations defining the dynamics of the relativistic plasma in the ideal mhd approximation is as follows , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the induced electric charge density , @xmath12 is the electric current density , @xmath13 is the electric field , @xmath14 is the spatial component of the plasma four - velocity and @xmath15 is the mass density of the plasma .",
    "the problem was solved in the cylindrical system of coordinates .",
    "some details of the solution method are given in appendix a. the numerical simulation was performed only in the quarter of the total box of simulation due to the symmetry of the flow in relation to the equatorial plane and the axis of rotation .",
    "the boundaries of the nearest zone include the surface of the star , the axis of rotation , the equator and the outer boundaries , which are a cylinder ( right hand side of the box ) and a plane perpendicular the axis of rotation at some distance from the source ( upper side of the box ) .",
    "the outer boundaries are located in the supersonic domain of the flow beyond the fast mode critical surface .",
    "this guarantees the independence of the solution in the nearest zone of the position and conditions of the outer boundaries .",
    "the number of independent boundary conditions on the surface of the star is equal to the number of mhd waves leaving the surface to satisfy the causality in the flow ( bogovalov @xcite ) .",
    "they are as follows : + 1 . a constant plasma density @xmath16 .",
    "+ 2 . a constant lorentz - factor @xmath3 of the plasma in the corotating frame system .",
    "a constant normal component of the poloidal magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "the continuity of the tangential component of the poloidal electric field .",
    "a constant temperature of the plasma equal to zero .",
    "the boundary conditions at the axis of rotation correspond to the axial symmetry of the flow .",
    "the boundary conditions at the equator follow from the symmetry of the flow in relation to the equatorial plane .",
    "this means that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    at the outer boundaries only one",
    "side internal derivatives were used for calculation of the derivatives in the finite differences , since the solution does not depend on the conditions down the flow from these boundaries .",
    "the flow in the far zone is fast mode supersonic .",
    "the system of equations describing the steady state flow is hyperbolic .",
    "therefore , a cauchy problem can be formulated for this flow .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the flux function @xmath25 as follows    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the poloidal magnetic field of the axisymmetric outflow and @xmath28 is the unit azimuthal vector .",

    "this difference can be understood from simple qualitative consideration .",
    "the dynamics of the cold plasma is basically controlled by two forces .",
    "one of them is the volumetric lorenz force , @xmath218 and the other is the volumetric coulomb force , @xmath219 ( see eq.(1 ) ) .",

    "the perpendicular component of the lorenz force is @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the component of the poloidal electric current parallel to the poloidal magnetic field and @xmath222 is the toroidal magnetic field .",

    "these forces are shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that these two forces are directed along opposite directions .",

    "the ratio of the coulomb and lorenz forces is of the order @xmath224 in this limit . in the relativistic limit",
    "the coulomb force becomes practically equal to the lorenz force and it strongly decreases the sc of the plasma .",
    "that is why the relativistic generalization of the parameter @xmath29 introduced earlier for the nonrelativistic winds ( bogovalov & tsinganos @xcite ) has additionally the lorentz factor in the denominator ( see eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) ) .",
    "although the lorentz factor in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) decreases remarkably the value of @xmath29 , it was expected that the collimation of the relativistic plasma will be strong enough at the condition @xmath106 . in the nonrelativistic case",
    "the collimation becomes strong already in the subsonic region under this condition .",
    "the most surprising result is that the relativistic plasma is practically not collimated , even under this condition .",
    "the increase of the collimating force does not provide more efficient collimation of the relativistic plasma ! this happens since another relativistic effect comes into play .",
    "the curvature @xmath225 of the stream lines of the nonrelativistic plasma is defined by the simple equation @xmath226 where @xmath92 is mass of particles , @xmath227 is the sum of all forces affecting the plasma perpendicular to the stream line .",
    "it is seen from this equation that an increase of the force @xmath227 results in an increase of @xmath228 , such that collimation becomes stronger . in other words , as it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) , @xmath228 is proportional to the collimating force and inversly proportional to the mass density of the outflowing plasma .",
    "the situation changes essentially in the case of the relativistic , poynting dominated plasma ( @xmath229 ) where the energy flux is dominated by the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , according to the familiar relationship between energy and mass ( @xmath230 ) , the flux of the energy is equivalent to some inertial mass flux .",
    "it follows from eq.([trans4 ] ) that eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) for the relativistic poynting - dominated plasma is modified as follows @xmath231 this equation demonstrates that the effective mass of the poynting- dominated plasma is dominated by the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "it is important that now the effective mass increases by a term proportional to @xmath232 .",
    "the collimating force is also proportional to the same term ( see eq .",
    "( [ trans4 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the increase of the collimating force is accompanied by a corresponding increase of the effective mass density of the plasma . this in turn results in the fact that the curvature @xmath228 of the stream lines does not increase with the increase of the collimating force .",
    "this is the reason why the collimation scale ( [ 26 ] ) at low latitudes does not depend on the magnetic field and angular velocity of the source .",
    "this work shows that the self - collimation ( sc ) process occurs in relativistic winds as predicted by the sc theory .",
    "the wind consists of a radially expanding part which surrounds a cylindrically collimated flow .",
    "the radius of the cylindrically collimated flow is @xmath233 , where @xmath76 is the initial radius of the fast magnetosonic surface .",
    "the mass flux in the collimated part is small compared with the total mass flux in the wind ( @xmath234 ) , even for relatively small lorentz factors .",
    "sc essentially decreases for larger lorentz factors .",
    "acceleration of the plasma occurs in the radially expanding wind while the plasma in the jet is not accelerated in this cold outflow model .",
    "the relatively small part of the mass flux in the cylindrically collimated flow has been also found in our simulations of nonrelativistic outflows ( bogovalov & tsinganos @xcite ) , although the magnetic flux contained in the relativistic case appears smaller by a factor of order 10 .",
    "in addition , the collimation scale at low latitudes does not depend on the magnetic field and the angular velocity of the central source for @xmath106 , in contrast with our results for the nonrelativistic winds in the same model .",
    "this means that the weak collimation of the relativistic plasma is due to the intrinsic property of the plasma and not to a property of the model .",
    "collimation decreases due to the affect of the electric force which becomes comparable with the collimating lorenz force in the relativistic    limit and in the high @xmath1 limit the collimation is saturated due to the contribution of the electromagnetic field into the inertial mass of plasma .",
    "the most striking feature of the collimated flows obtained in the model under consideration is that a very small fraction ( @xmath234 ) of the mass flux exists in the collimated flow in comparison to the mass flux in the wind .",
    "this result is apparently in conflict with observations of agn .",
    "the source of the wind energy is the gravitational energy released by the accreted matter .",
    "therefore , the energy flux in the wind should be less than the luminosity of the accretion disk where about half of the gravitational energy is released ( shakura & sunyaev @xcite ) . the total luminosity of agn @xmath235 in soft electromagnetic emission ( below x - rays ) should be comparable with the energy released at the accretion . according to our results the energy flux in the jet @xmath236 should be by the factor @xmath237 less than the accretion energy , @xmath238 .",
    "this disagrees with observations .",
    "x - ray and gamma - ray emission is usually attributed to the emission from jets ( urry & padovani @xcite ) . sometimes , the luminosity of the jets is less only by a factor of 10 than the total luminosity of agn at other wavelengths ( elvis et al .",
    "the energy flux in this emission can be considered as the lower limit on the energy flux in the jet ( however , we do not take into account beaming here ) .",
    "if so , we have in agn @xmath239 .",
    "this disagreement between theory and observations implies that either the present model has no observed counterpart or the sc mechanism is not able in principle to provide collimation of the major fraction of the outflow into the jet .",
    "it is important in this regard to understand from the theoretical point of view what modifications should be made in order to provide magnetic collimation of the major fraction of the relativistic wind .",
    "this problem has been already investigated by bogovalov & tsinganos ( @xcite ) in relation to nonrelativistic winds .",
    "it was shown in this study that in a model consisting of a central source ejecting a high - speed wind and an accretion disk ejecting a nonrelativistic magnetised outflow , all the mass flux from the central source can be cylindrically collimated indirectly by the surrounding disk - wind .",
    "apparently , a collimation of the major part of a relativistic outflow from a central source can be provided by the same mechanism in the context of the present model as well .",
