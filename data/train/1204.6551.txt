    "<S> ( [ fig : vortex ] ) ( a ) , the system has translation symmetry in @xmath132 direction and rotation symmetry according to @xmath132 axis </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the momentum @xmath133 and total angular momentum @xmath134 are good quantum numbers , and the schordinger equation can be solved numerically for each sector of @xmath135 by introducing a discretization , as described in the appendix in detail . </S>",
    "<S> fig [ fig : chiral ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the band dispersion along z direction for the angular momentum @xmath136 , and the corresponding wave function . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the chiral modes in the zeroth landau level are compensated by modes with opposite chirality on the boundary , which is expected since in such a finite system the number of left and right moving 1d states must be equal . with increasing the angular momentum @xmath134 , the wavefunction of the inner chiral mode moves towards larger radius , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the wave functions of the two chiral states near @xmath137 and @xmath138 will overlap with each other for large angular quantum @xmath134 ( fig [ fig : chiral ] ( d ) ) , leading to a gap opening , as shown in fig [ fig : chiral ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we obtain a finite number of chiral modes in the zeroth landau level . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the number of chiral modes is determined by the total flux of @xmath27 in the system , just like the case of uniform @xmath46 field . </S>",
    "<S> in such a configuration , the consequence of the anomaly equation ( [ eq : pc_anomaly ] ) is actually a quantum hall effect@xcite . in an electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath139 parallel to @xmath46 , the anomaly equation describes a charge generation around the center of the system , while the charge on the boundary is annihilated . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of a hall current flowing along the radial direction towards the center , which can be measured in transport experiments .    </S>",

    "<S> consider a uniform magnetic field @xmath140 and a uniform vector potential @xmath141 changing adiabatically in time . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly equation leads to @xmath142 , with @xmath143 the landau level degeneracy . </S>",

    "<S> it is important to note that the two zeroth landau levels with opposite chirality have the same spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the exchange coupling of @xmath145 with the zeroth landau level states is equivalent to a scalar potential , which shifts the chemical potential and leads to the change of charge density .    since this term couples charge density and magnetization , it leads to an interesting physical consequence of the hybridization between the plasmon and magnon modes . </S>",
