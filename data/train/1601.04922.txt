    "singular boundary value problems ( sbvps ) is an important class of boundary value problems , and arises frequently in the modeling of many actual problems related to physics and engineering areas such as in the study of electro hydrodynamics , theory of thermal explosions , boundary layer theory , the study of astrophysics , three layer beam , electromagnetic waves or gravity driven flows , inelastic flows , the theory of elastic stability and so on . in general , sbvps is difficult to solve analytically .",
    "therefore , various numerical techniques have been proposed to treat it by many researchers .",
    "however , the solution of sbvps is numerically challenging due to the singularity behavior at the origin .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested again in the following sbvps arising frequently in applied science and engineering : @xmath0 subject to the boundary value conditions @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are any finite real constants . if @xmath5 , ( 1 ) becomes a cylindrical problem , and it becomes a spherical problem when @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath7 is continuous , @xmath8 exists and is continuous and @xmath9 for any @xmath10 such that equation ( 1 ) has a unique solution @xcite .",
    "the sbvps ( 1)-(3 ) with different @xmath11 arise in the study of various scientific problems for certain linear or nonlinear functions @xmath7 .",
    "the common cases related to the actual problems are summarized as follows .",
    "the first case for @xmath6 and @xmath12 emerges from the modeling of steady state oxygen diffusion in a spherical cell with michaelis - menten uptake kinetics @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath13 represents the oxygen tension ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive constants involving the reaction rate and the michaelis constant .",
    "hiltmann and lory @xcite proposed the existence and uniqueness of the solution for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "analytical bounding functions were given in @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods to solve the sbvps for this case have attracted a reasonable amount of research works , such as the finite difference method ( fdm ) @xcite , the cubic spline method ( csm ) @xcite , the sinc - galerkin method ( sgm ) @xcite , the adomian decomposition method ( adm ) and its modified methods @xcite , the variational iteration method ( vim ) @xcite , the series expansion technique ( sem ) @xcite and the b - spline method ( bsm ) @xcite .",
    "the second case arises in the study of the distribution of heat sources in the human head @xcite , in which @xmath6 and @xmath18 in @xcite , point - wise bounds and uniqueness results were presented for the sbvps with the nonlinear function @xmath7 of the forms given by ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "quite a little amount of works by using different approaches , including the fdm @xcite , the csm @xcite and the sgm @xcite , have been proposed to obtain the approximate solutions of this case .",
    "the third important case of physical significance is when @xmath19 and @xmath20 which arises in studying the theory of thermal explosions @xcite and the electric double layer in a salt - free solution @xcite .",
    "a variety of numerical methods have been applied to handle such sbvps , for example , the fourth order finite difference method ( ffdm ) @xcite , the modified adomian decomposition method @xcite , the taylor series method ( tsm ) @xcite and the bsm @xcite .",
    "besides , chandrasekhar @xcite derived another case for @xmath21 and @xmath22 which @xmath23 is a physical constant .",
    "this case is in connection with the equilibrium of thermal gas thermal @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of this kind of equation for @xmath24 was considered by using various methods , such as the ffdm @xcite , the vim @xcite , the sem @xcite and the modified adomian decomposition method @xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned methods can yield a satisfied result .",
    "however , each of these methods has its own weaknesses .",
    "for example , the vim @xcite has an inherent inaccuracy in identifying the lagrange multiplier , and fails to solve the equation when the nonlinear function @xmath7 is of the forms ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . those methods such as the fdm @xcite , the sem @xcite , the sgm @xcite and the spline method @xcite require a tedious process and huge volume of computations in dealing with the linearization or discretization of variables .",
    "the adm @xcite needs to obtain the corresponding volterra integral form of the given equation , via which one can overcome the difficulty of singular behavior at @xmath25 .",
    "the modified adm @xcite needs to introduce a twofold indefinite integral operator to give better and accurate results ; moreover , the success of method in @xcite relies on constructing green s function before establishing the recursive relation for applying the adm to derive the solution components .",
    "all those manners are at the expense of computation budgets . besides",
    ", none of above methods is applied to handle the equations with all forms of nonlinearities ( 4)-(7 ) .    in recent years , a lot of attentions have been devoted to the applications of differential transform method ( dtm ) and its modifications .",
    "the dtm proposed by pukhov @xcite at the beginning of 1980s . however , his work passed unnoticed . in 1986 , zhou reintroduced the dtm to solve the linear and nonlinear equations in electrical circuit problems @xcite .",
    "the dtm is a semi - numerical - analytic method that generates a taylor series solution in the different manner . in the past forty years",
    ", the dtm has been successfully applied to solve a wide variety of functional equations ; see @xcite and the references therein .    although being powerful , there still exist some difficulties in solving various of equations by the classical dtm .",
    "some researchers have devoted to deal with these obstacles so as to extend the applications of the dtm .",
    "for example , in view of the dtm numerical solution can not exhibit the real behaviors of the problem , odibat _",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed a multi - step dtm to accelerate the convergence of the series solution over a large region and applied successfully to handle the lotka - volterra , chen and lorenz systems . in @xcite , authors suggested an alternative scheme to overcome the difficulty of capturing the periodic behavior of the solution by combining the dtm , laplace transform and pad approximants .",
    "another difficulty is to compute the differential transforms of the nonlinear components in a simple and effective way . by using the traditional approach of the dtm",
    ", the computational difficulties will inevitably arise in determining the transformed function of an infinity series .",
    "compared to the traditional method , chang and chang @xcite proposed a relatively effective algorithm for calculating the differential transform through a derived recursive relation . yet , by using their method , it is inevitable to increase the computational budget , especially in dealing with those differential equations which have two or more nonlinear terms being investigated .",
    "recently , the authors @xcite disclosed the relation between the adomian polynomials and the differential transform of nonlinearities , and developed an inspiring approach to handle the nonlinear functions in the given functional equation .",
    "meanwhile , the problem of tedious calculations in dealing with nonlinear problems by using the adm has also been improved considerably by duan @xcite .",
    "all of these effective works make it possible to broaden the applicability and popularity of the dtm considerably .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop an efficient approach to solve the sbvps ( 1)-(3 ) with those nonlinear terms ( 4)-(7 ) .",
    "this scheme is mainly based on the improved differential transform method ( idtm ) , which is the improved version of the classical dtm by using the adomian polynomials to handle the differential transforms of those nonlinear functions ( 4)-(7 ) .",
    "no specific technique is required in dealing with the singular behavior at the origin . meanwhile , unlike some existing approaches , the proposed method tackles the problem in a straightforward manner without any discretization , linearization or perturbation .",
    "the numerical solution obtained by the proposed method takes the form of a convergent series with those easily computable coefficients through the adomian polynomials of those nonlinear functions as the forms of ( 4)-(7 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the concepts of dtm and adomian polynomials are introduced .",
    "algorithm for solving the problem ( 1)-(3 ) and an upper bound for the estimation of approximate error are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 shows some numerical examples to testify the validity and applicability of the proposed method . in section 5 , we end this paper with a brief conclusion .",
    "in the adomian decomposition method ( adm ) , a key notion is the adomian polynomials , which are tailored to the particular nonlinearity to easily and systematically solve nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the interested readers are referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for the details of the adm .    for the applications of decomposition method ,",
    "the solution of the given equation in a series form is usually expressed by @xmath26 and the infinite series of polynomials @xmath27 for the nonlinear term @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is called the adomian polynomials , and depends on the solution components @xmath30 . the traditional algorithm for evaluating the adomoan polynomials @xmath31",
    "was first provided in @xcite by the formula @xmath32 a large amount of works @xcite have been applied to give the more effective computational method for the adomian polynomials . for fast computer generation ,",
    "we favor duan s corollary 3 algorithm @xcite among all of these methods , as it merely involves the analytic operations of addition and multiplication without the differentiation operator , which is eminently convenient for symbolic implementation by computer algebraic systems such as maple and mathematics .",
    "the method to generate the adomian polynomials in @xcite is described as follows : @xmath33 such that @xmath34 it is worth mentioning that duan s algorithm involving ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) has been testified to be one of the fastest subroutines on record @xcite , including the fast generation method given by adoamin and rach @xcite .",
    "the differential transform of the @xmath35 differentiable function @xmath13 at @xmath25 is defined by @xmath36}_{x=0},\\ ] ] and the differential inverse transform of @xmath37 is described as @xmath38 where @xmath13 is the original function and @xmath37 is the transformed function .    for the practical applications , the function @xmath13 is expressed by a truncated series and eq .",
    "( 14 ) can be written as @xmath39    it is not difficult to deduce the transformed functions of the fundamental operations listed in table 1 .",
    ".the fundamental operations of the dtm . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    consider the following sbvp with nonlinear term different from the forms ( 4)-(7 ) which arises in the radial stress on a rotationally symmetric shallow membrane cap @xcite : @xmath40 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath41    the adomian polynomials of nonlinear term @xmath42 in this problem are computed as @xmath43    like the previous problems 3 and 4 , a closed - form solution to this equation can not be written down .",
    "so we instead investigate the absolute residual error functions and the maximal error remainder parameters to examine the accuracy and the reliability of our numerical results . here , the absolute residual error functions are @xmath44 and the maximal error remainder parameters are @xmath45 in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the absolute residual error functions @xmath46 for @xmath47 through 14 by step 2 .",
    "the logarithm plot for the maximal error remainder parameters @xmath48 for the same @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , which demonstrates an approximately exponential rate of convergence of the obtained truncated series solutions and thus the presented method converges rapidly to the exact solution .",
    "even though there is no exact solution for this problem , the following 10th order approximation has an accuracy of o(@xmath50 ) and can be used for practical applications @xmath51",
    "in this work , a reliable approach based on the idtm is presented to handle the numerical solutions of a class of nonlinear sbvps arising in various physical models .",
    "this scheme takes the form of a truncated series with easily computable coefficients via the adomian polynomials of those nonlinearities in the given problem . with the proposed algorithm",
    ", there is no need of discretization of the variables , linearization or small perturbation .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed method works well for the sbvps ( 1)-(3 ) with a satisfying low error . besides , it is obvious that evaluation of more components of the approximate solution will reasonably improve the accuracy of truncated series solution by using the proposed method .",
    "comparisons of the results reveal that the present method is very effective and accurate .",
    "moreover , we are convinced that the idtm can be extended to solve the other type of functional equations involving nonlinear terms more easily as the adomian polynomials are applicable for any analytic nonlinearity and can be generated quickly with the aid of the algorithm proposed by duan .",
    "it is necessary to point out that algebraic equation ( 23 ) is a nonlinear one , and we shall inevitably encounter the bad roots while solving it . the criterion to separate the good root from a swarm of bad ones is convergence because it represents the value of unknown function at the origin and will not change for the different @xmath49 .",
