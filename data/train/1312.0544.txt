    "a fascinating fact of cuprate research is that despite three decades of extensive research , experiments still uncover new and unexpected results which surprise our hitherto reached consensus .",
    "the latest addition to this investigation comes from various spectroscopic findings of a fully gapped or ` insulating'-like electronic structure in deeply underdoped region,@xcite where nodal @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry is expected .",
    "this feature is ubiquitously exhibited in many hole - doped cuprates studied so far , including la - based,@xcite bi - based,@xcite cl - based,@xcite and also yb - based compounds.@xcite this unexpected result led to essential questions such as : is the fully gapped state related to superconductivity other than @xmath1-wave , or is it derived from the exotic normal state , or does it arise from the interplay of superconductivity with any normal state phase , or others ?",
    "nodeless @xmath1-wave pairing state is demonstrated earlier to exist in electron - doped cuprates,@xcite and also in 122 iron - chalcognenides.@xcite however , in these cases either interaction or band structure topology removes the nodal states in the non - sc state itself , which thus yields a fully gapped electronic structure despite @xmath1-wave being the underlying pairing symmetry . but this description does not apply to the nodeless state in hole - doped systems since as temperature is raised above the sc state , a truncated fermi surface ( fs ) is experimentally verified to exist in the nodal region.@xcite motivated by this unexpected behavior , several possible explanations have been put forward in recent times which include coulomb disorder effect,@xcite polaron effect,@xcite @xmath4 pairing,@xcite topological superconductivity,@xcite , dynamical mean - field theory calculations@xcite .",
    "however , no consensus is yet reached .    -0.6",
    "cm    our theory stems from the fact that the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase of the parent compound persists up to the underdoped region and couples to superconductivity.@xcite the evidence of the coexistence of afm and sc in the underdoped region is well documented in numerous nmr,@xcite neutron scattering@xcite data in multilayered bi - based cuprates@xcite upto doping @xmath58 - 12% , tl- and hg - based cuprates@xcite upto doping @xmath510% , and yb - based cuprates@xcite upto doping @xmath58 - 10% .",
    "interestingly , the fully gapped state observed in these materials lies indeed within this doping range .",
    "based on these data , we draw a generalized cuprate phase diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the interplay between the two competing interactions generically yields a dynamically generated new sc order parameter with finite center - of - mass .",
    "earlier calculations predicted that for the competition of afm and @xmath1-wave sc , the third sc order parameter is a nodal @xmath1-wave sc if no magnetic field is applied,@xcite or a time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath6-triplet sc if a magnetic field is applied in the heavy - fermion systems@xcite .",
    "here we find that constrained by the symmetry consideration of the @xmath1-wave sc pairing symmetry and a single valued afm ordering vector @xmath2 in the cuprates , the third order parameter is an odd - parity superconductor which does not break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "most interestingly , the dynamically generated triplet superconductivity is also nearest neighbor , as in the @xmath1-wave case , but it gives a fully gapped electronic structure which removes the nodes of the @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "we develop a generic mean - field hamiltonian based on the short range coulomb repulsion and attractive potential to self - consistently evaluate all three coupled order parameters at a given doping . for experimental verification of our theory , we compute the temperature dependence of the superfluid density ( inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic penetration depth ) in the uniform coexistence state of all three interactions .",
    "we show that the exponential temperature dependence of the superfluid density will be a definitive test of the triplet sc origin of the apparent ` insulating ' state in lightly doped cuprates .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude modulation of the second sc gap can be directly visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) .",
    "in the afm state , the fs is reconstructed owing to the reduced brillouin zone ( bz ) defined by the modulation vector @xmath2 and the residual fs consists of small hole - pockets centering at the nodal points .",
    "the corresponding fs topology is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for a realistic value of the afm gap at doping @xmath70.08 ( see below ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that when superconductivity appears in the new magnetic bz , two types of cooper pairs form .",
    "the typical @xmath1-wave cooper pairs form between two electrons with opposite momenta and spin lying on different quadrant of the bz as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermionic creation operator at the crystal momentum @xmath10 with up spin ( say ) .",
    "additionally , two afm quasiparticles @xmath9 and @xmath11 lying inside and outside the magnetic bz boundary , respectively , now become decoupled , and naturally form a second cooper pairs with finite but single - valued center - of - mass momentum @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "such cooper pairs give fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) type unconventional superconductivity originally proposed for pauli limiting systems.@xcite we lay out below a ginzburg - landau criterion to deduce the symmetry of the fflo state in cuprates .",
    "we now write down a mean - field based hamiltonian for the single band case , relevant for most cuprates,@xcite in which all aforementioned order parameters are treated on equal footing .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian is derived in the apendix a from the full interacting hamiltonian , and here we start with an effective hamiltonian expressed in the nambu - gorkov basis in the magnetic bz @xmath14 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the non - interacting dispersion of the effective cuo@xmath17 band expressed by tight - binding formalism in the appendix a and the parameters are fitted to the la@xmath18sr@xmath19cuo@xmath20 ( lsco ) dispersion.@xcite @xmath21 is the onsite coulomb repulsion . the other three symbols @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the three mean - field order parameters for the afm , @xmath1-wave and @xmath24-wave fflo sc phase , respectively , as defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",

    "it is interesting to notice that both pairing symmetries transform in the same way under the particular choice of afm wavevector @xmath12 as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the last identity also makes the triplet pairing respects time - reversal symmetry under this particular magnetic order . to see that we write down the ginzburg - landau type free energy as : @xmath37 + ... , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a constant and ` ... ' represents all the other quadratic , quartic and dipole coupling terms .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the staggered in - plane magnetic moment @xmath39 only allows the creation of a vector form of the fflo pairing @xmath40 for a singlet sc order parameter @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned before , since the time - reversed or the complex conjugate of @xmath40 lies outside the magnetic zone boundary with an opposite sign , the above coupling remains invariant under time - reversal symmetry .",
    "finally , since superconductivity breaks guage symmetry , while magnetism does not , the third order parameter must also break the guage symmetry , i.e. , the third order parameter must be a sc phase which allows the hamiltonian to be guage invariant . in this way",
