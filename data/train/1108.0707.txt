    "the description of nuclear masses in terms of the liquid drop model paved the way to the basic understanding of nuclear properties , like the saturation of the nuclear force , the existence of pairing and shell effects , and the description of fission and fusion processes @xcite .",
    "the q - values of different nuclear reactions , obtained from mass differences , must be accurately known to allow the description of the astrophysical origin of the elements @xcite .",
    "accurate theoretical predictions of nuclear masses remain a challenge @xcite , sharing the difficulties with other quantum many - body calculations , and complicated by the absence of a full theory of the nuclear interaction .",
    "decades of work have produced microscopic and macroscopic mass formulas @xcite . at present ,",
    "the most successful approaches seem to be the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite , the skyrme and gogny hartee fock bogolyubov ( hfb ) @xcite , and the duflo - zuker ( dz ) mass formula @xcite .",
    "they allow for the calculation of masses , charge radii , deformations , and in some cases also fission barriers .",
    "they all contain a macroscopic sector which resembles the liquid drop mass ( ldm ) formula , and include deformation effects .",
    "hfb calculations are now able to fit known nuclear masses with deviations competitive with the 95 frdm calculations , which are also being improved , while the most precise and robust nuclear mass predictions are given by the dz model @xcite .",
    "the liquid drop mass ( ldm ) formula captures the macroscopic features of the mass dependence on the number of neutrons @xmath0 , of protons @xmath1 , and on its mass numbers @xmath2 .",
    "it includes volume and surface terms , the coulomb interaction between protons , wigner and symmetry terms , linear and quadratic in the neutron excess @xmath3 , and a pairing term .",
    "it is generally assumed that the liquid - drop energy of a spherical nucleus is described by a bethe - weizscker mass formula @xcite , being a common practice to describe nuclear masses and radii of spherical closed - shell nuclei in terms of a mean field and add deformation and other shell effects as corrections @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this contribution to show that , when nuclei with measured masses are grouped according with their quadrupole deformations , three liquid drop mass formulas consistently allow for a fit with an rms smaller than 750 kev for the set of most prolate deformed nuclei , while they are unable to fit the masses of spherical nuclei with an rms smaller than 2000 kev . semi - magic nuclei are fit with a similarly large rms .",
    "the parameters of the three models are studied , showing that the surface symmetry term is the one which varies the most from one group of nuclei to another . in one model , isospin dependent terms",
    "are also found to exhibit strong changes .",
    "shell effects refer to the differences between the experimental binding energies @xcite and the ldm predictions . in this work",
    "they are included employing linear , quadratic @xcite , 3- and 4-body terms @xcite , functions of the number of valence nucleons , following the ideas of the duflo - zuker model @xcite.the inclusion of shell effects allows for better fits , while the smallest rms are found again in the prolate deformed nuclei region .",
    "three liquid drop mass formulas will be employed to analyze their ability to fit nuclear masses .",
    "one of them treats consistently volume and surface effects @xcite .",
    "the second one incorporates explicitly isospin effects @xcite while the third one includes quadratic isospin effects , the diffuseness correction to the coulomb energy , the charge exchange correction term and the curvature energy @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an improved version of the liquid - drop mass formula with modified symmetry and coulomb terms is built , following a consistent treatment of nuclear bulk and surface effects .",
    "the negative nuclear interaction energy is given by :    @xmath4    where the pairing interaction is given by @xmath5 = 2 , 1 , and 0 for even - even , odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei , respectively .",
    "a modification @xmath6 in the coulomb term is included @xmath7 its presence in the denominator of the coulomb term suggests that it can be viewed as a correction to the radius of the nucleus .",
    "the symmetry term employs @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 to account for the wigner energy .",
    "the coulomb interaction is proportional to @xmath10 to avoid the coulomb interaction of a proton with itself .",
    "the second ldm formula we are going to analyze was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering isospin effects . in this case the liquid - drop energy of a spherical nucleus is described by a modified bethe - weizscker mass formula @xmath11 with isospin asymmetry @xmath12 .",
    "the pairing term is taken form @xcite @xmath13 and the symmetry energy coefficient of finite nuclei is written as , @xmath14\\ ] ] based on the conventional surface - symmetry term of liquid - drop model , with a small correction term for description of isospin dependence of @xmath15 . the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath15 increases with decreasing isospin asymmetry .",
    "this @xmath16 correction term approximately describes the wigner effect for heavy nuclei .",
    "different mass formulae derived from the liquid drop model and the pairing and shell energies of the thomas - fermi model have been studied and compared in ref @xcite .",
    "we selected for this study to include the diffuseness correction to the coulomb energy , the charge exchange correction term and the curvature energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is reported that the coulomb diffuseness correction @xmath17 term and the charge exchange correction @xmath18 term play the main role to improve the accuracy of the mass formula .",
    "the wigner term and the curvature energy can also be used separately but their coefficients are very unstable .",
    "their ldm formula is @xmath19 the volume energy corresponding to the saturated exchange force and infinite nuclear matter is given by the first term .",
    "@xmath20 is the asymmetry energy of the bethe - weizscker mass formula .",
    "the second term is the surface energy .",
    "its origin is the deficit of binding energy of the nucleons at the nuclear surface and corresponds to semi - infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the following term is the curvature energy .",
    "it results from non - uniform properties which correct the surface energy and depends on the mean local curvature .",
    "the decrease of binding energy due to the coulomb repulsion is given by the fourth term , which has and adjustable charge radii @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath17 term is the diffuseness correction to the sharp radius coulomb energy , also called also the proton form - factor .",
    "the @xmath18 term is the charge exchange correction term .",
    "the pairing energies of the thomas - fermi model @xcite were employed .",
    "the coefficients of the three ldm were selected to minimize the root mean square deviation ( rms ) when the predicted binding energies @xmath22 are compared with the experimental ones @xmath23 , reported in ame03 @xcite , modified so as to include more realistically the electron binding energies as explained in appendix a of lunney , pearson and thibault  @xcite .",
