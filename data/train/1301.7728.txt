    "during quite a long time it was assumed that the maximum achievable density of hard ellipsoids was given by the stretched face cubic centered ( sfcc ) , with a volume fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "however , after the observation of certain crystal structures capable of surpassing this threshold  @xcite , the high density region of the original phase diagram  @xcite has been significantly modified  @xcite . naturally , the updated phase diagram must include the crystal structures which , under large compressions , produce the maximally achievable densities .",
    "in particular , pfleiderer and schilling  @xcite found that a family of crystals named sm2 ( simple monoclinic with two orientations ) showed smaller free energies than that of the sfcc for ellipsoids having large asymmetries , whereas the opposite was found for ellipsoids with small asymmetries  @xcite . on the other hand , the structures given by donev et .",
    "al .  showing the maximally known achievable densities are particular cases of the sm2 family  @xcite .",
    "at present , the phase diagram of hard ellipsoids with large asymmetry shows consistency between the free energy predictions and the structure showing the maximally achievable density . from low to high densities , there is an isotropic fluid , a nematic fluid , and finally a sm2 crystal structure which would yield the densest structure under infinite pressure .",
    "conversely , the low asymmetry region still looks incomplete .",
    "that is , there is an isotropic fluid , a plastic crystal  @xcite , and a sfcc structure of parallel ellipsoids which can not be compressed to reach the maximum packing fraction ( parallel ellipsoids can not exceed the fcc density limit  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the sfcc structure of parallel ellipsoids must somehow distort to increase its density under extreme compression , or suffer another phase transition to produce the sm2 structure .",
    "in recent work we revisited the phase diagram of hard ellipsoids of revolution by means of replica exchange monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "this was done by setting random initial conditions , and the results confirmed the spontaneous formation of sm2 crystal structures at high densities and relatively large anisotropies , and parallel sfcc structures for small anisotropies . in the present work we employ the same technique but setting the starting cells as perfect sm2 crystal structures having the maximum known packing density  @xcite .",
    "this is done with the hope that these structures are indeed the ones that reach the maximum packing density .",
    "if so , the obtained results should correspond to equilibrium .",
    "anyway , a direct comparison with the pressure - density curves from random initial conditions is possible .",
    "if curves match , equilibrium would be the case .",
    "on the contrary , the method will be certainly failing in the sense that the ergodic hypothesis is violated for the given conditions .",
    "the setting of perfect sm2 structures as initial conditions allows us to capture a very high pressure sfcc - sm2 transition for small anisotropies . in this region",
    ", we find that the sm2 structure holds only at very high pressures , turning first into a parallel sfcc structure and then into a plastic - solid when decreasing pressure and density .",
    "according to our results , obtained for small systems , the sfcc - sm2 transition is not first order .",
    "the existence of this sfcc - sm2 transition occurs only above the plastic solid phase , for both , oblates and prolates , whereas the sfcc structure region vanishes at large anisotropies .",
    "the paper is organized in four sections . following this brief introduction , the second section describes the employed models and methods . in a third section ,",
    "the high pressure phase transition for the small anisotropic ellipsoids is shown , together with a comparison between the results obtained by starting from sm2 structures and from random initial configurations . some remarks and conclusions",
    "are given in a final section .",
    "in order to perform a simulation of hard ellipsoids , we need an efficient way to avoid particle overlapping . for this purpose , we use an analytical approach for the exact hard ellipsoids contact distance . the expression is based on the berne and pechukas  @xcite closest approach distance ( also called hard gaussian overlap  @xcite ) , and includes a corrective term to improve precision .",
    "this term was introduced by rickayzen to fix the known t - shape berne and pechukas mismatch .",
    "the rickayzen - berne - pechukas ( rbp ) expression reads  @xcite @xmath1 + \\big ( 1 - \\chi ) \\chi ' \\big [ a^{+ } a^{- } \\big ] ^{\\gamma } } } , \\ ] ] being @xmath2 @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parallel and perpendicular diameters with respect to the ellipsoid axis of revolution , respectively .",
    "we define the aspect ratio of the ellipsoids as @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 corresponds to prolates , and @xmath8 to oblates .",
    "analogously , the maximum aspect ratio is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the maximum and minimum axes , respectively . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unit vectors along the axis of revolution of each particle , and @xmath14 is the unit vector along the line joining the geometric particle centers . finally , @xmath15 is introduced  @xcite to further approach to the exact perram and wertheim numerical solution  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 values are given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the average difference between the analytical approach and the exact numerical solution is always below @xmath16 for @xmath17 , for a collection of @xmath18 random configurations ( varying @xmath14 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) .",

    "@xcite described an arrangement of ellipsoids able to surpass the maximal density of the sfcc structure .",
    "this structure is generated starting from a horizontal layer ( a ) of equally oriented ellipsoids , such that 5 ellipsoids are fitted in contact inside a face - centered square lattice of side @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme]a ) ) .",
    "the two axes parallel to the horizontal plane are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "as we are assuming ellipsoids of revolution , the length of the axis perpendicular to this plane will be also given by @xmath5 .",
    "within these conditions , the length of the square lattice is @xmath21 then , a second horizontal layer ( b ) is built on top of the first one following the same procedure , but rotated by @xmath22 around the perpendicular direction .",
    "the second layer is also shifted in such a way that the centers of the ellipsoids are located in the holes formed by the first layer , each ellipsoid of the second layer touching four ellipsoids of the first one .",
    "this procedure is repeated successively , leading to a stratification in the form ababab ... , where each layer perfectly fits in the holes of the other . in both cases ( prolates and oblates ) ,",
    "the obtained structure is denser than the sfcc structure for @xmath23 , and leads to a density maximum when the ellipsoids in the face - centered layers touch six rather than four in - plane neighbors , which occurs for @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath23 , we are taking this structure as the one with the highest possible density .",
    "the distance between two equally oriented layers , @xmath25 , can be analytically determined by considering that the ellipsoids of two consecutive layers are in contact .",
    "this calculation can be simplified to a two - dimensional problem in the vertical plane ( @xmath26-plane of fig .  [ scheme ] )",

    "one particle is placed at one ( any ) of the prism vertices with its axes at the base plane forming a @xmath38 angle with any given side of the base .",

    "then , the volume fraction is @xmath40 where we used that the volume of the ellipsoid is @xmath41 .",
    "this equation predicts a continuous growth of the packing fraction as we increase the asymmetry from the value for spheres ( @xmath42 ) , until it finally reaches a saturation value for @xmath24 , where each ellipsoid touches six in - plane ellipsoids instead of four .",
    "the packing fraction obtained at this saturation point is @xmath43  @xcite .    for @xmath44 , donev et .",

    "hence , this should lead to any desired aspect ratio @xmath44 while preserving a mono - component system and keeping the same maximum density .",
    "the stretching can be done in a direction perpendicular to the layers ( in general , this would not lead to ellipsoids of revolution ) , or in a direction parallel to any diagonal of the face - centered square lattice of layers a or b , since they coincide . in the case of our unit cell",

    "this technique was developed to enhance sampling at difficult ( high density / low temperature ) conditions  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the definition of an extended ensemble whose partition function is given by @xmath60 , being @xmath61 the number of ensembles and @xmath62 the partition function of ensemble @xmath63 .",
    "this extended ensemble is sampled by @xmath61 replicas , each replica placed at each ensemble . the extended ensemble justifies the introduction of swap trial moves between any two replicas , whenever the detailed balance condition is satisfied . for hard particles ,",

    "we implemented a standard sampling of the @xmath69 ensembles , involving independent trial displacements , rotations of single ellipsoids , and volume changes .",
    "to increase the degrees of freedom of our small systems ( @xmath70 ) , we implemented non - orthogonal parallelepiped cells .",
    "thus , sampling also includes trial changes of the angles and relative length sides of the lattice vectors defining the simulation cell .",
    "this is done while rescaling the cell sides and particles positions to preserve volume and keep a simple acceptation rule .",

    "adjacent pressures should be close enough to provide reasonable swap acceptance rates between neighboring ensembles . in order to take good advantage of the method",
    ", the ensemble at the smaller pressure must also ensure large jumps in configuration space , so that the higher pressure ensembles can be efficiently sampled .",
    "simulations started from the donev - sm2 structures described in the previous section .",
    "we first perform about @xmath75 trial moves at the desired state points , during which we check that the replicas have reached a stationary state ( thermalization stage ) .",
    "it should be noted that achieving a stationary state requires considerably less simulation steps when starting from these ordered configurations than when starting from loose random configuration cells  @xcite .",
    "we then perform @xmath76 additional sampling trials .",
    "maximum particle displacements , maximum rotational displacements , maximum volume changes , and maximum changes of the lattice vectors are adjusted for each pressure to yield acceptance rates close to 0.3 .",
    "since an optimal allocation of the replicas should lead to a constant swap acceptance rate for all pairs of adjacent ensembles  @xcite , we implemented a simple algorithm to smoothly adjust the intermediate pressures while keeping the maximum and minimum pressures fixed . to start the simulations",

    "then , there is a solid - solid transition between a plastic crystal and a sfcc crystal .",
    "finally , at high density we observe another solid - solid transition , between the sfcc structure and the densest sm2 crystal .",
    "the first two transitions are first order , as pointed out by the @xmath87 discontinuity ( see fig .",

    "we must stress that this last conclusion may be affected by the small system sizes we are considering .",

    ", a very subtle increase of @xmath89 is observed for the sfcc - sm2 transition .",
    "we can get a more clear evidence of the solid - solid phase transitions by studying the behavior of the radial distributions functions , @xmath90 , and the radial orientational order parameter functions , @xmath91 , defined as @xmath92  @xcite .",

    "for this purpose , we performed a similar analysis , but now considering other aspect radios for both oblate and prolate cases .",
    "the obtained results allow the construction of a refreshed hard - ellipsoid phase diagram , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] .",
    "the diagram is split in half by the hard sphere case ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "prolate cases are at the left and oblate systems are at the right of this vertical line .",
    "particles asymmetry increases by moving away from this central line .",
    "the extreme cases are infinitely narrow needles ( @xmath101 at the left ) and infinitely thin plates ( @xmath101 at the right ) . prolates with @xmath102 are not included since a larger number of particles is needed to fulfill the minimum - image convention for all densities . at high densities , we are placing the ( currently accepted ) maximally achievable density  @xcite as a black solid line . all transitions found in our simulations",
    "are indicated in this chart .",

    "isotropic - nematic fluid - fluid and sfcc - sm2 solid - solid transitions are higher order , and thus , they are shown as a single point , located at the packing fraction where the isothermal compressibility reaches a local peak . all other transitions are first order , and thus , a couple of symbols are used to denote the borders of the coexistence regions .",
    "the phase boundaries are determined by means of the histogram re - weighting technique described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the numerical values are given in tables  [ table1 ] and  [ table2 ] . according to previous results , increasing the system size",
    "would slightly shift the transitions towards larger densities and would make them slightly wider  @xcite .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] illustrates a zoom of the high density area above the plastic region .",
    "there , it can be appreciated a narrow density region where the sfcc solid spontaneously forms .",
    "hence , for very low asymmetries , the plastic solid turns into a sfcc solid before taking the form of a sm2 structure under very high compression .",
    "it should be noted that the sfcc solid region is not so small in terms of the pressure range at which it is stable . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pressure ] , the sfcc stable region can be several hundreds of @xmath103 wide ( see also table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the existence of a stable sfcc structure above the plastic solid region is in agreement with radu et .",
    "nonetheless , and despite that the phase boundaries for the sfcc structure were not given , it was suggested that this structure should be the most stable for @xmath104 .",
    "our data show that this is only true for a very small density region above the plastic solid , so a sfcc - sm2 transition appears at very high pressures and densities .",
    "free energy calculations through thermodynamic integration should confirm this finding  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this transition should necessarily exist in order to be consistent with the fact that the sm2 structure is the one leading to the maximally achievable density for all aspect ratios .",
    "this section is devoted to compare the remc results obtained by starting from loose random cells ( data taken from  @xcite ) with those obtained from dense sm2 initial configurations . in order to support the ergodicity of the simulated systems , one should obtain the same results regardless of the initial configurations . for certain systems at very high pressures ,",
    "the ergodic condition is difficult to achieve .",
    "this is simply because simulations tend to get stuck on configuration space at high densities .",
    "when this occurs , in turn , dynamical properties usually show solid - like behaviors .",
    "that is , particles relaxation times diverge , and diffusion coefficients turn practically zero  @xcite .",
    "thus , with the aim of enhancing sampling at these difficult conditions , certain monte carlo techniques were developed , usually introducing unnatural displacements while keeping the detailed balance condition .",
    "this is the case of the remc technique , where replicas can travel throughout different ensembles .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ section - remc ] , an improved sampling can be obtained whenever a relatively large swap acceptance rate is achieved between all set pressures .",
    "nonetheless , this does not guaranty ergodicity .",
    "for instance , replicas may frequently jump from one side to the other of a coexistence region without residing during a large number of steps where they do not belong  .",
    "that is , the replica having the most compressed fluid - like configuration may swap positions with the replica having the less compressed solid - like structure , across a coexistence region , but this fluctuation may not last long enough to allow the fluid - like configuration become solid - like and vice - versa .",
    "consequently , there would be a low rate of generation of new solid - like structures , and the improved sampling may be not sufficient to attain ergodic conditions .",
    "an example where remc works well is given in fig .",
    "[ oblates-1.3 ] .",
    "there it is shown how the results obtained starting from dense sm2 structures ( dark circle curves ) match the ones started from loose random initial conditions ( light square curves ) .",
    "this figure corresponds to oblates with @xmath105 , and considers the pressure range @xmath106 for random initial conditions and @xmath107 for sm2 initial conditions .",
    "as observed , both runs present the same density jumps , pointing out the isotropic - plastic fluid - solid , and the plastic - sfcc solid - solid transitions .",
    "in fact , the dark @xmath88 curve also shows a sfcc - sm2 transition , appearing as a small shoulder developed at the right of the plastic - sfcc transition peak .",
    "this subtle transition , which is better seen from the slight distortion of the gaussian density distributions and from the radial distribution functions ( not shown ) , is not captured by the run with random initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the plastic - sfcc solid - solid transition is captured by both runs is quite remarkable , given the extremely high density at which it occurs .",
    "in general , we observed good agreements between runs started from different conditions for ellipsoids with @xmath108 .    the comparison for prolates with @xmath109 is shown in fig .  [ prolates-1.5 ] .",
    "here , it is seen a good match between the two cases only for densities below the isotropic - sm2 fluid - solid transition .",
    "in fact , the transition is not captured when starting from random initial configurations .",
    "instead , the fluid curve extends towards higher densities , defining a metastable branch which can not be broken even by a very large number of remc cycles .",
    "this metastable branch is analogous but stronger than the one for hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the relationship @xmath110 is satisfied for both data sets .",
    "fulfilling the above relationship , suggested to hold only at equilibrium  @xcite , is then a necessary but not sufficient condition for equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "note that the order parameter @xmath80 indicates the development of some bond order at the transition .",
    "another curiosity is that an extrapolation of the metastable branch would intersect the solid branch .",
    "it should be said that for densities below but close to the transition , the isotropic fluid shows extremely low translational and rotational diffusion coefficients  @xcite , i.  e. dynamics turns glassy .",
    "thus , when starting from random initial configurations , the glassy dynamics not only hinders the solid formation when dynamics simulations are used , but also when remc is the employed technique . the other way around ,",
    "when remc produces an apparent stationary state which differs from equilibrium at high densities , a glassy dynamics may be expected .",
    "the occurrence of disordered structures at very large densities was also found experimentally  @xcite and by means of computations  @xcite .",
    "these references report that disordered states yield a maximally random jammed density , @xmath111 , peaking at @xmath112 .",
    "additionally , they show that prolates produce slightly higher maximally random jammed densities than oblates .",
    "another example where curves do not entirely agree is shown in fig .",
    "[ prolates-4.0 ] . here",
    "again , a good match between the different runs is obtained for densities below the nematic - sm2 fluid - solid transition ( the agreement on the description of the isotropic - nematic fluid - fluid transition is very good ) . for densities above the fluid - solid transition and for a given pressure , the run with initial random configurations yields smaller densities , isothermal compressibilities , and @xmath80 values than the ones obtained starting from sm2 structures .",
    "nonetheless , both runs capture a fluid - solid transition and , in addition , the resulting solid structures are similar .",
    "we then justify differences due to the appearance of imperfect sm2 structures when starting from disordered configurations .",
    "this turns evident from a snapshot overview ( not shown ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that only certain box - shapes can hold an exact number of particles of a given perfect sm2 structure .",
    "this effect , for the system sizes we are employing , is important . in previous work",
    "@xcite we only let free the angles of the simulation cells .",
    "however , this procedure seems to be not enough to completely relax the solid phase . in the present work we are letting angles and sides to vary independently .",
    "hence , systems with different degrees of freedom are being compared and this is why differences appear for the solid phases .",
    "summing up , starting from random initial configurations has the following characteristics : a ) it naturally produces highly dense structures which may assist proposing the equilibrium structure or confirm / refute the believed equilibrium structure .",
    "b ) it allows the detection of strong metastable regions , which may be linked to systems showing extremely low dynamics .",

    "c ) the imposition of a crystal structure not representative of equilibrium may lead to a stationary state inside a strong metastable region ( strategies to find structure candidates to reach maximally achievable densities , i.  e.  structure candidates for equilibrium at very high pressures , are given elsewhere  @xcite ) . from combining random and crystal initial conditions",
    "a better understanding of the system is possible , i.  e. by comparing results from both strategies one can detect metastable regions or support ergodicity .",
