    "scintillating bolometers  cryogenic detectors with a heat - light double read - out  can play a crucial role in next - generation experiments to study neutrino properties and weak interaction via investigating neutrinoless double beta ( 0@xmath12@xmath2 ) decay , as discussed in refs .",
    "this technique is extensively developing now within the lucifer @xcite , the amore @xcite , and the lumineu @xcite 0@xmath12@xmath2 projects .",
    "this paper describes the recent achievements in the framework of the lumineu programme ( luminescent underground molybdenum investigation for neutrino mass and nature ) .",
    "lumineu is devoted to the development of a technology based on zinc molybdate ( znmoo@xmath0 ) scintillating bolometer as a basis for the realization of a high - sensitivity 0@xmath12@xmath2 experiment .",
    "the good prospects of this material for the bolometric technique are clearly shown in recent investigations @xcite .",
    "an important point in the realization of lumineu is concerned with the technology of growing high - quality radiopure large mass ( 0.30.5 kg ) znmoo@xmath0 single crystals with the aim to produce scintillators enriched in @xmath3mo ( zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 ) . here",
    "we report a significant progress in the development of znmoo@xmath0 crystal scintillators using deeply purified compounds ( containing molybdenum with natural isotopic composition and enriched in @xmath3mo )",
    ". we also present results of both aboveground and underground low temperature tests of new scintillating bolometers based on natural znmoo@xmath0 and enriched zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 crystal scintillators in light of their possible application to next - generation 0@xmath12@xmath2 decay experiments .",
    "a precursor of the lumineu programme , a slightly yellow colored 313 g znmoo@xmath0 sample with irregular shape , was produced from the first large volume znmoo@xmath0 crystal boule grown by the low - thermal - gradient czochralski ( ltg cz ) technique @xcite in the nikolaev institute of inorganic chemistry ( niic , novosibirsk , russia ) .",
    "the second sample ( with mass 329 g ) produced from this boule was tested as a scintillating bolometer at the gran sasso national laboratories ( lngs , assergi , italy ) @xcite .",
    "advanced znmoo@xmath0 crystal boules with mass of @xmath4  1 kg have been produced recently at the niic by using the ltg cz growth technique and molybdenum purified by sublimation in vacuum and double recrystallization from aqueous solutions @xcite .",
    "the crystals were recrystallized to improve quality of the material , and two colorless znmoo@xmath0 cylindrical samples ( with size @xmath550@xmath640  mm and mass 336 and 334 g ) were produced from them .",
    "moreover , a zinc molybdate crystal boule ( with mass 171 g ) enriched in @xmath3mo to 99.5% was developed for the first time at the niic @xcite , and two scintillation elements ( with mass 59 and 63 g ) were cut from the boule .",
    "the enriched molybdenum was purified by sublimation and recrystallization from aqueous solutions .",
    "it is worth noting the high yield of the zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 crystal boule from the initial charge ( 84% ) and low level of total irrecoverable losses of enriched material ( 4% ) achieved in the frame of this r&d @xcite .",
    "some coloration of the crystal ( in contradiction with the practically colorless samples produced from natural molybdenum ) can be explained by remaining traces of iron in the enriched molybdenum and by crystallization procedure performed only one time @xcite .    in order to construct scintillating bolometers ,",
    "all the above described samples were held inside copper holders by using ptfe clamps .",
    "both zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 crystals were mounted in one copper holder .",
    "the crystal scintillators were surrounded by a reflector foil ( 3 m vm2000/2002 ) to improve light collection .",
    "thin ultra - pure ge wafers ( @xmath550@xmath60.25  mm ) were used for detecting scintillation light .",
    "the 313 g crystal was viewed by two light detectors fixed on the opposite sides .",
    "the znmoo@xmath0 / zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 crystals and the ge photodetectors were instrumented with neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge thermistors used as temperature sensors .",
    "all the crystals were also assembled with an individual heating element based on a heavily - doped silicon meander .",
    "such devices provide a stable resistance value and are used to inject periodically a certain amount of thermal energy with the aim to control and stabilize the thermal bolometric response .",

    "both cryostats are surrounded by passive shield made of low activity lead to minimize signals pile - up caused by environmental gamma rays due to a slow time response of the bolometers ( hundreds millisecond ) .",
    "the stream data were recorded by a 16 bit adc with a sampling frequency of 30 khz and 10 khz for natural and enriched detectors , respectively .",
    "the znmoo@xmath0 precursor was operated at 17 mk during the measurements ( over 38 h ) , while the zn@xmath3moo@xmath0 array was tested at 13.7 mk ( 18 h ) , 15 mk ( 5 h ) , and 19 mk ( 24 h ) base temperatures .",

    "was performed by using the optimum filtering @xcite .",
    "the spectrometric performances of the precursor - based bolometer were deteriorated by the pile - ups effect due to considerably high counting rate @xmath11 2.5 hz ( e.g. see in table  [ tab:1 ] the energy resolution of the 2615 kev @xmath12 peak ) . in spite of this , the test shows normal operability of the detector and allows us to estimate the scintillation light yield for the registered @xmath13 events and muons , as well as the possibility of particle discrimination between @xmath13 and @xmath14 events due to the quenching of scintillation for @xmath14 particles .",
