    "if the above expression is nonpositive for a particular singularity , then it admits no @xmath27hd smoothing .",

    "* theorem  8.1 ) a @xmath27hd smoothingcomponent has dimension given by equation  , which expression , by theorem  [ thm : nonexist ] is nonpositive .",
    "consequently the smoothing component does not exist , concluding the proof .",
    "the difficulty in proving theorem  [ thm : nonexist ] is that singularities with resolution graphs having at least two nodes are usually non - taut .",
    "indeed , there may exist many analytically different singularities with the same resolution graph , and the dimension @xmath85 in formula   depends on the analytic structure of the singularity @xmath8 .",
