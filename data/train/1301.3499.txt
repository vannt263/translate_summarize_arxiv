    "measuring the kinetic power of extragalactic jets has application in two important areas of astrophysics : ( 1 ) determining the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) kinetic luminosity function and its evolution  an important factor in the study of radio galaxy feedback @xcite ; and ( 2 ) assessing the contribution of black hole spin in the production of extragalactic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , accurate estimates of jet kinetic energy flux can provide an important constraint in assessing x - ray emission models of kpc - scale quasar jets @xcite .",
    "accurate measurement of jet power in radio galaxies is key to quantifying their effect on galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite showed that bow shocks driven by the high power radio sources can suppress star formation in not only the agn host , but also in other nearby galaxies .",
    "more importantly for the current work , the ratio of radio luminosity ( @xmath1 ) to jet power ( @xmath2 ) , also known as the radiative efficiency , is sensitive to the division of energy between radiating and non - radiating particle populations , and therefore may be used to investigate the lobe energetics .",
    "however , measuring the kinetic power of radio galaxies has proven to be a very difficult problem .",
    "the lack of reliable empirical methods to measure the kinetic power of agn jets has resulted in the widespread use of a model - dependent predictor of jet power derived by @xcite , based on synchrotron minimum energy calculations in combination with the self - similar model of radio galaxy evolution @xcite . @xcite",
    "obtain an expression for the jet power @xmath3 (  w \" for willott ) in terms of the 151 mhz radio luminosity @xmath4 where @xmath3 is time averaged kinetic power of a source with radio luminosity @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a parameter accounting for systematic error in the model assumptions .",
    "these model assumptions include , among other things , the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles , the low frequency cutoff in the synchrotron spectrum , and departures from minimum energy .",
    "it is argued by @xcite that @xmath7 , implying a systematic uncertainty of 2 orders of magnitude in jet power for a given radio luminosity , owing to the @xmath8 dependence .",
    "the willott et al .",
    "jet power relation is widely used to estimate the mechanical output from agn based on a single low frequency luminosity measurement , assuming that the value of @xmath6 is constant ( typically of order 10 - 20 ) across the entire population of radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath6 is often calibrated against fri radio galaxies for which the jet power has been determined based on the observed x - ray cavities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this procedure of calibrating the value of @xmath6 for frii radio galaxies based on measurements of fri radio galaxies may not be appropriate because of their vastly different energy budgets : non - radiating particles are thought to dominate the energy budget of fri radio lobes by a factor of @xmath9 in some cases @xcite , while in frii radio galaxies , radiating particles are thought to dominate the energy budget @xcite , indicating that significantly different values of @xmath6 should apply to the different morphological classes .",
    "indeed , it appears that vastly different values of @xmath6 apply to fri radio galaxies with different evolutionary histories @xcite .",
    "moreover , the self - similar model of radio source evolution , on which equation [ eqn : willott ] is based , does not strictly apply to fri radio galaxies .",
    "not only is the normalisation of the @xcite relation highly uncertain , so too is the exponent .",
    "@xcite use the oii narrow line luminosity ( @xmath10 ) as a proxy for jet power , and argue that equation [ eqn : willott ] is valid because the power law exponent matches that of the @xmath11 correlation that they find in their sample .",
    "however , the slope of the @xmath12 correlation is highly uncertain , and strongly depends on the sample involved : @xcite find @xmath13 , while @xcite find @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 is expected to exhibit a fairly weak dependence on accretion power , and the relationship is likely to be non - linear in general @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the correlation between @xmath15 and accretion related x - ray emission is not significant after the common correlation with redshift is accounted for , however , @xcite find a correlation between jet power and narrow line luminosity for a sample of flat - spectrum radio quasars .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that when the minimum energy calculations are performed correctly , the exponent in equation [ eqn : willott ] depends on the spectral index of the source , which in turn is a function of source age ( shabala & godfrey 2012 , hereafter paper 2 ; blundell et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we seek to address these outstanding questions regarding the @xmath0 relation in frii radio galaxies using an empirical means to determine the jet power .",
    "jet power in frii radio galaxies and quasars can be estimated directly from measurements of the hotspot size and equipartition magnetic field strength , along with a number of reasonable assumptions regarding the hotspot plasma . in this paper",
    "we provide a derivation and analysis of this technique , and investigate the relationship between jet kinetic power and monochromatic radio luminosity for a sample of high power frii radio galaxies .",
    "we compare the resulting @xmath0 relation to the equivalent relation obtained for fri radio galaxies based on x - ray cavity measurements , as well as that derived by willott et al .",

    "in section 2 we provide a derivation of the jet power measurement technique based on the parameters of the terminal hotspots . in section 3",

    "this equality holds regardless of assumptions about the jet characteristics such as its composition or the ratio of magnetic to particle energy densities in the jet or hotspot .",
    "therefore , if the general principle of conservation of momentum applies between the jet and hotspot , we can estimate the jet kinetic luminosity simply by calculating the momentum flux in the hotspot . to do so",
    ", we assume that the lepton population in the hotspot is ultra - relativistic ( @xmath44 ) and that the proton population in the hotspot , if it exists , is at best mildly relativistic , and can be approximated as a thermal gas ( @xmath45 ) so that the hotspot enthalpy density , @xmath46 , is parametrized as follows @xmath47 we further assume that in the hotspot , the magnetic field is aligned perpendicular to the jet direction , i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath49 , consistent with radio polarisation maps of hotspots .",

    "we can write @xmath52 and then express the jet energy flux in terms of @xmath51 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 \\left ( \\frac{b}{b_{\\rm eq } }   \\right)^{-(1+\\alpha ) } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in this section , we empirically determine the value of @xmath55 in equation [ eqn : q_hs_b_eq_0 ] by applying the hotspot method to sources with independent jet power measurements .",
    "the prototypical frii radio galaxy cygnus a is the prime candidate for calibrating the normalisation factor , since its hotspot parameters are well determined and the jet power has been independently measured using a variety of methods . @xcite",

    "we estimate the jet power of cygnus a using equation  [ eqn : q_hs_b_eq_0 ] along with the parameters for the terminal hotspots ( hotspots a and d ) given in @xcite . the derived jet power is @xmath61  ergs  s@xmath20 , which implies @xmath62 in this source .",

    "this source does not appear in our sample because the beam size of the highest resolution map available to us is larger than @xmath64 of the source linear extent , and therefore , the hotspots may not be adequately resolved ( see section [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "the hotspots in this source are faint relative to the surrounding lobe emission , making the determination of hotspot parameters difficult . despite these problems , based on the hotspot sizes and flux density given by @xcite",
    ", we obtain a hotspot jet power estimate of @xmath65  ergs  s@xmath20 , which implies @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite estimate the jet power for a sample of 31 high power frii radio galaxies , using the expression @xmath67 , where @xmath28 is the lobe pressure calculated using minimum energy arguments , @xmath68 is the lobe volume assuming cylindrical symmetry , and @xmath69 is the spectral age of the source .",
    "the @xcite sample includes four sources from our sample ( 3c 55 , 3c 244.1 , 3c 289 and 3c 337 ) .",
    "for these four sources , the average value of @xmath55 required to match the jet power values of @xcite is @xmath70 .",
    "the low value derived for the normalisation factor ( @xmath71 ) indicates that the hotspot plasma is close to equipartition conditions , consistent with the results of inverse compton modelling in hotspots @xcite and lobes @xcite of frii radio galaxies .",

    "we can constrain this ratio , assuming at most one proton per radiating lepton , via an estimate of the mean electron lorentz factor @xmath73 in the hotspot , since @xmath74 for a power - law electron energy distribution of the form @xmath75 , the mean electron lorentz factor @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 . in each case where flattening of the hotspot radio spectrum has been directly observed ,",
    "estimates of @xmath80 are in the order of several hundred : pks  1421490 , @xmath81 650 @xcite ; cygnus a , @xmath81 300 - 400 @xcite ; 3c295 , @xmath81 800 @xcite ; 3c123 , @xmath81 1000 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite inferred a cutoff lorentz factor @xmath82 in 3c 196 by synchrotron self - compton modelling of the hotspot spectral energy distribution .",
    "all of the above listed @xmath80 estimates appear to be distributed around a value of order @xmath82 , and this value of the minimum lorentz factor may arise naturally through the dissipation of bulk kinetic energy in the hotspots @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath82 , and with typical electron energy index @xmath83 , equation [ eqn : rhoc2 ] implies @xmath84 .",

    "@xcite argue , on the basis of synchrotron self compton modelling of x - ray emission in a large sample of frii radio galaxy hotspots , that magnetic field strengths are close to the equipartition estimates ; that is @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we consider the bulk velocity of the hotspot plasma , @xmath89 .",
    "the post - shock velocity following a normal shock in an unmagnetised plasma with relativistic equation of state is @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite discovered a hotspot spectral index asymmetry in the sense that hotspots fed by the approaching jet have a flatter spectral index than hotspots fed by the receding jet .",
    "this observation can be explained if the hotspots are moderately doppler beamed and have curved spectra , with higher frequencies corresponding to a steeper spectrum .",
    "the observed hotspot spectral index asymmetry requires only moderate velocity in the hotspot regions , with @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "given the constraints on hotspot parameters discussed above , we plot the function @xmath55 to determine physically realistic values ( figure [ fig : g_function ] ) . in this figure",
    "we plot @xmath55 as a function of @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that the emprically derived value of @xmath98 is consistent with expectations .",
    "we note that @xmath99 for a hotspot near minimum energy with a proton / electron composition , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , while @xmath102 for a purely leptonic hotspot near equipartition conditions and @xmath100 .",
    "we select a subset of the complete , flux limited sample of 3crr frii radio sources with redshifts @xmath103 @xcite . in order to limit the effects of observing resolution , we excluded objects for which there are fewer than 100 beam widths across the source in the highest resolution maps available to us .",
    "hotspot sizes are typically 1 percent of the source size @xcite , and therefore a lower limit of 100 beams along the source ensures that the beam size is smaller than , or approximately equal to the hotspot size .",
    "a total of 62 sources met this criteria .",
    "we further restricted our sample to include only those sources for which a clear jet termination could be determined for at least one side of the source , resulting in a sample size of 30 . using the radio maps available from the 3crr frii online database ,",
    "we independently measured the hotspot sizes and flux densities in a consistent manner : we fit a 2d - gaussian function to each hotspot using the casa task imfit , but only included in the fit those pixels with a value greater than half the hotspot peak value .",
    "this typically resulted in @xmath104 pixels being used in the fit .",
    "we do not attempt to model or subtract the background contributed by the surrounding lobe emission , but we have mitigated the effect of the lobe emission by restricting the model - fitting routine to include only the bright part of the hotspot .",
    "also , our sample was chosen to include only those hotspots that were well resolved from the surrounding lobe emission , and we expect that for the majority of hotspots in our sample , the lobe emission has a negligible impact on our derived hotspot size / flux density . for each source , we used the highest resolution fits image available from the online database .",
    "the hotspot jet powers derived in this way are on average @xmath105 greater than the values determined using the measured hotspot size and flux density given by @xcite . in at least one instance , the fitting routine gave unreasonable results , and we then estimated the hotspot region from the map , and extracted the flux using an elliptical aperture of the same dimensions as the hotspot dimensions estimated from cross - sectional profiles of the hotspot .    as with @xcite",
    ", we have not quoted errors for hotspot flux density or size since the dominant source of error comes from the ambiguity in defining the hotspot region , and is therefore , to some extent , subjective .",
    "however , we have minimised the ambiguity by restricting our sample to include only those sources for which the beam width is less than , or comparable to the expected hotspot size @xcite , and therefore expect our derived hotspot powers to be reliable estimates , free of large systematic bias .",
    "for each hotspot , we compute the equipartition magnetic field strength @xmath51 using standard expressions @xcite assuming negligible energy density in non - radiating particles . we assume a power - law electron energy distribution of the form @xmath75 with @xmath106 between a minimum lorentz factor @xmath107 ( see * ? ? ? * ) and maximum lorentz factor @xmath108 . for each hotspot",

    "we sum the power derived from the hotspots on each side of the source to obtain the total source power . in section",
    "[ sec : calorimeters ] , we discuss the reliability of jet power measurements from individual hotspots , and find that typically the jet power estimated for a pair of hotspots in the same source agree to within a factor of 2 . in a few cases , only one hotspot could be used for a reliable jet power estimate , and in that case , we multiplied the derived value by a factor of 2 , to account for the power in the oppositely directed jet .",
    "the sample and derived jet powers are given in table [ table : sample ] .",
    "we perform least - squares minimisation in log space to fit a power law of the form @xmath110 to the data , and find a best - fit relation @xmath111 calculating the hotspot jet powers using the measured hotspot parameters tabulated by @xcite results in jet powers that are on average a factor of 1.5 lower .",
    "assuming @xmath112 rather than @xmath107 increases the normalisation of the best - fit curves by a factor of approximately 1.5 .",
    "the assumed hotspot spectral index affects the slope of the derived best - fit relation , however the effect is comparable to the statistical uncertainty in the slope due to the scatter in the correlation . for example , assuming that the hotspot spectral index is @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 results in a marginally flatter best - fit relation , with an exponent of @xmath115 .",
    "a number of authors have investigated the relationship between agn jet power and radio power in nearby low - luminosity sources using x - ray cavity measurements ; the most widely discussed recent work being that of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of jet kinetic power based on x - ray cavity measurements are inherently limited to relatively nearby , low power objects , typically of fri morphology . we seek to compare our results to the @xmath117 relation obtained for fri radio galaxies . to do so",
    ", we have used the x - ray cavity jet power estimates compiled by @xcite along with 151 mhz radio luminosities extrapolated from low frequency measurements , assuming a spectral index @xmath113 .",
    "the low - frequency luminosities for the cavagnolo sample lie between @xmath118 mhz , and are mostly at 327mhz .",
    "this is sufficiently close to 151 mhz for the assumed value of spectral index to be largely insignificant : a departure in the assumed spectral index of @xmath119 results in only a @xmath120 error in @xmath121 .",
    "we have converted the best - fit relation of @xcite to one involving @xmath121 : @xmath122    the exponent in the above relation for fri radio galaxies is in excellent agreement with the exponent determined for our sample of high power frii sources ( equation [ eqn : our_best_fit ] ) .",
    "we plot equation [ eqn : q_fri ] in figure [ fig : q_hs ] along with the data for the @xcite sample of low - luminosity radio galaxies ( red points ) , and the data for our sample of frii radio galaxies ( green squares ) using the assumption @xmath109 ( see section [ sec : empirical_g ] ) .",
    "we find no evidence for a significant offset between the fri and frii @xmath0 relations : the normalisations formally agree if @xmath123 , which is entirely consistent with our analysis in sections [ sec : empirical_g ] and [ sec : g_theoretical ] .",

    ". also found that the @xmath0 relation for luminous frii radio galaxies is in broad agreement with an extrapolation of the one given by @xcite for fri radio galaxies .",
    "our result , the broad agreement between the fri and frii @xmath0 relations , appears at odds with the emerging scenario in which the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles differs greatly between these two classes of radio galaxy .",
    "however , as we discuss in section [ sec : predicted_offset ] , differences in the age and environment for the two samples used in this study , as well as a possible difference in the fraction of energy associated with shocks , will counteract the offset between the @xmath117 relations expected to arise due to the differing energy budgets of the radio lobes .",
    "hotspots of frii radio galaxies are thought to be variable on short timescales @xcite , and as such , caution must be exercised when interpreting the derived jet power for individual objects .",
    "however , provided that the general principle of conservation of momentum applies between jet and hotspot , on a population basis we expect this method to be a reliable estimator of jet power , and in particular , may be used to investigate the @xmath0 relation at high radio luminosities .",
    "more than half of the sources in our sample have two hotspots , one at each end of the source , that enable jet power estimates .",

    "@xcite revised the analysis of @xcite to account for a different minimum energy formalism .",
    "in particular , these authors pointed out that a large fraction of the synchrotron - emitting electron population may radiate below the frequency cutoffs assumed by @xcite .",
    "because of this , it makes more sense to recast the minimum energy argument in terms of cutoff lorentz factors of the electron energy distribution .",

    "@xcite estimate @xmath126 for a sample of mostly fri radio galaxies by equating the internal lobe pressure with the external pressure , and requiring that the magnetic field strength be in energy equipartition with the particles .",
    "they find @xmath126 lies in the range @xmath132 , with a median value of @xmath133 .",

    "in contrast , @xcite find that the equipartition lobe pressures of frii radio galaxies are typically close to pressure equilibrium with the external medium .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that the magnetic field strength in the lobes of frii radio galaxies , determined via synchrotron and inverse compton modeling of the radio to x - ray spectra , is close to the equipartition value determined from the radio data alone assuming negligible energy in non - radiating particles .",
    "they conclude that frii lobes are unlikely to contain an energetically dominant population of non - radiating particles , because that would require the magnetic field energy to be matched to the energy of just the relativistic electron population rather than the energy of the entire particle population .",
    "the inferred difference in lobe energy budget is not altogether surprising , since frii lobes are surrounded by bow shocks , and the jets are surrounded by cocoon plasma , making significant entrainment of ambient material rather more difficult than in fri lobes , for which this is not the case .",
    "if @xmath134 in fri radio galaxy lobes ( the median value from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath135 in frii radio galaxy lobes , then naively applying equation  [ eqn : k_dependence ] to both morphological classes with @xmath113 , we would expect the normalisation of the @xmath0 relation for fri radio galaxies to be greater than that of friis by a factor of @xmath136 .",
    "this is clearly not observed ( see figures [ fig : q_hs_with_cavagnolo ] and [ fig : fri_comparison_histogram ] ) , and the close agreement between the @xmath0 relations is puzzling , given such a large predicted offset .",
    "however , the radio luminosity is affected by a number of other source parameters , including the density of the medium into which the radio source expands @xcite . for a given radio luminosity , @xmath137 ( paper  2 ; willott et al .",
    "1999 ) , where @xmath29 is a characteristic ambient gas density .",
    "fri radio sources typically inhabit more dense environments than frii radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the environment dependence will reduce , to some extent , the predicted offset in radiative efficiency described above .",
    "we test this hypothesis by comparing the position of cygnus a in the @xmath117 plane ( figure [ fig : q_hs_with_cavagnolo ] ) to that of our sample of frii radio galaxies .",
    "cygnus a is known to lie in a high density environment , more similar to the cluster environments of the fri radio galaxies than the group or field environments of typical frii radio galaxies , and therefore its luminosity is significantly  environmentally boosted \" relative to similar sources located in less dense environments @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : q_hs_with_cavagnolo ] it can be seen that cygnus a is indeed an outlier compared to our sample of frii radio galaxies , shifted to higher radio luminosity .",
    "this offset is due to the  environmental boosting \" of cygnus a resulting from its dense environment .",
    "@xcite estimate that the luminosity of cygnus a would be reduced by up to a factor of 30 if it were located in a field environment .",
    "this would shift cygnus a to align with the other frii radio galaxies in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "however , cygnus a is only a factor a few below the fri @xmath0 relation , and so the environmental dependence can not be the only compensating factor .",
    "we note that the effect of  environmental boosting \" in dense environments may be counteracted to some degree by a possible positive correlation between the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles and the environment density @xcite .",
    "strong shocks driven by powerful frii radio galaxies may also decrease their radiative efficiency relative to fri radio galaxies .",
    "unlike fri radio galaxies , powerful frii radio galaxies drive strong shocks that sweep up and heat the ambient gas ahead of the cocoon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the energy associated with these shocks can be a significant , indeed dominant , factor in the frii energy budget @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath0 relation should be independent of source size . in paper",
    "2 we show that this is in fact not the case , due to significant energy losses suffered by radiating electrons though inverse compton scattering",
    ". these losses result in an effective steeping of the spectral index @xmath16 in equation  [ eqn : k_dependence ] , and therefore a decrease in radiative efficiency . for the oldest sources the jet power can easily be underestimated by as much as a factor of three .",
    "finally , we note that the x - ray cavity jet power estimates used by @xcite , and hence the normalisation in equation [ eqn : q_fri ] , may be underestimated .",
    "shocks , which are currently ignored in the x - ray cavity jet power calculations , may be energetically important in fri radio galaxies for a substantial part of their evolution , at least in some sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the buoyancy timescale used to estimate the source age could be an overestimate of the true source age , resulting in systematically underestimated jet power measurements @xcite .",
    "a somewhat surprising corollary of our results , and the above discussion , is that an extrapolation of the @xmath0 relation for low power fri radio galaxies provides a reasonable approximation for high power sources , despite their vastly different lobe energy budgets .",
    "the exponent in equations [ eqn : our_best_fit ] and [ eqn : q_fri ] is @xmath138 .",
    "in contrast , the predicted exponent in the @xmath0 relation ( equation [ eqn : k_dependence ] ) , for a typical spectral index @xmath139 , is approximately 0.8 .",
    "however , in a flux limited sample , selection bias will cause a systematic increase in radiative efficiency ( a decrease in the willott @xmath6 factor ) with increasing radio luminosity : the low luminosity end will be populated by sources with both low kinetic power and low radiative efficiency ( high @xmath6 ) , while the high luminosity end will be populated by sources with both high kinetic power and high radiative efficiency ( low @xmath6 ) .",
    "for this reason alone , it is clear that a single value for the @xmath6 factor can not be applied to the entire source population , and the selection bias will flatten ( reduce ) the observed slope of the @xmath0 relation , potentially accounting for the difference between predicted and observed slopes .",
    "relatedly , we note that given the common assumption of @xmath140 based on the x - ray cavity jet power measurements for fri radio galaxies , the willott et al .",
    "relation ( equation [ eqn : willott ] ) predicts that the most luminous frii radio sources ( @xmath141 w  hz@xmath20",
    "sr@xmath20 ) have jet power in the order of 10@xmath142 erg  s@xmath20 .",
    "this is equivalent to the eddington luminosity of a 10@xmath143 solar mass black hole , and an order of magnitude greater than estimates of jet power in samples of radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that @xmath144 for the highest luminosity bins .",
    "we have presented a new method to measure the kinetic power in agn jets based on the observed size and luminosity of the jet terminal hotspots . with this new method",
    "we were able to confront , from a new perspective , an emerging scenario in which the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles differs between the two morphological classes of radio galaxy ( fri / frii ) . @xcite and @xcite estimate that the ratio of energy in non - radiating particles to the energy in radiating particles , @xmath126 , could be as high as 4000 in some sources , with a median value of approximately 200 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite demonstrate that @xmath145 in frii radio galaxy lobes .",
    "such a large difference in the lobe energy budgets suggests a large difference between the radiative efficiency of the two morphological classes , of more than an order of magnitude . to test this hypothesis , we estimated the jet kinetic power using the new method based on observed hotspot parameters , for a carefully selected sample of frii radio galaxies .",
    "we compared the resulting @xmath0 relation to that determined for fri radio galaxies by @xcite based on jet power measurements determined using the x - ray cavities method .",
    "we find approximate agreement between the fri and frii radio galaxy @xmath117 relations , which is ostensibly difficult to reconcile with the differing lobe energy budgets .",
    "however , a combination of environmental factors , spectral ageing and strong shocks driven by powerful frii radio galaxies reduces the radiative efficiency of these objects relative to fris , and conspires to move them onto the fri @xmath117 relation .",
    "an unexpected outcome of our work is that an extrapolation of the @xmath0 relation determined for low power fri radio galaxies provides a reasonable approximation for high power sources , despite their apparently different lobe energy budgets .",
    "in this section we consider the requirements for the jet lorentz factor in order to apply the assumption @xmath146 .",
    "consider the ratio @xmath147 let us assume a tangled magnetic field ( isotropic distribution in solid angle ) in the jet . then @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in that case",
