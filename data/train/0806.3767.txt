    "accounting for about @xmath0 of the energy density of the universe @xcite , dark matter is an integral part of our surroundings .",
    "it dominates the more familiar , baryonic components , which comprises only @xmath1 of the universe , on the largest scales .",
    "achieving an understanding of this perplexing dark element is one of the most compelling unsolved problems in modern astrophysics .",
    "the astrophysical evidence for the existence of dark matter is overwhelming , as observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the power spectrum of the universe @xcite , and colliding galaxy clusters @xcite all point towards the same conclusion . with an understanding that a dark , pressureless , fluid - like component permeates the universe , astrophysicists have successfully simulated the large - scale processes of structure formation in the context of a @xmath2cdm universe @xcite .",
    "more recently , some attention has been given to the dark matter substructure formed on subgalactic scales , down to scales of order @xmath3pc @xcite .",
    "however , relatively little consideration has been given to the distribution of dark matter within our own solar system .    yet",
    ", dark matter may prove to be profoundly important in our solar system for both its additional gravitational effects on planets and other orbiting bodies @xcite as well as the motions of spacecraft @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a knowledge of the density and velocity of dark matter particles is particularly important for terrestrial direct detection experiments @xcite .    in this paper , we model the solar system and the dark matter that it encounters in order to quantify how much dark matter we expect the solar system to have captured over its lifetime . through favorable three - body gravitational interactions between a dark matter particle , the sun , and any of the planets , a non - zero and possibly significant fraction of the dark matter passing through the solar system",
    "will become gravitationally bound to it .",
    "the remainder of this paper is focused on solving this problem , and is laid out as follows : section 2 details the model chosen for the solar system and galactic properties , and provides analytic details of our calculations .",
    "section 3 sets forth the computations undertaken to successfully determine the probability of binding dark matter to the solar system .",
    "section 4 presents our results , including the density and mass distributions of dark matter with respect to distance from the sun .",
    "we recommend that anyone not interested in the details of our calculations skip directly to section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes with a discussion of the conclusions reached from our analysis , detailing significant implications for dark matter detection and presenting a comparison of our results with the current experimental and observational constraints .",
    "our sun ( and hence our solar system ) is presently moving through the galaxy with well - known parameters @xcite that have changed little , despite refinements in measurements @xcite , over many years .",
    "more recently , we have been able to determine that our milky way , like all comparable galaxies , is pervaded by a dark matter halo with a specific density profile @xcite .",
    "@xmath4-body simulations also provide insights into modeling the milky way @xcite . based on",
    "the fact that our sun is not an isolated body , but rather has eight planets as well as a number of other , less significant bodies gravitationally bound to it , a non - zero fraction of this dark matter will be captured by favorable three - body interactions between a dark matter particle , the sun , and an orbiting body .    in order to compute the amount of dark matter captured by the solar system over the course of its @xmath5 history , we assume the galactic parameters shown in table [ milkyway ] below .",
    ".[milkyway ] the local galactic and dark matter parameters used for the milky way and the present values of the sun s distance and velocity components . unless otherwise noted , all velocities are in units of @xmath6 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our calculations and computations then allow us to determine what fraction of this total mass winds up getting gravitationally captured via these three - body interactions . our results are presented in table [ results ] .",
    "the two most important factors contributing to capture are the mass and the orbital semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "the more massive and the further away a planet is from the sun , the more effective it will be at capturing dark matter , as the cross - section for favorable gravitational interactions is given by the radius of the sphere of influence @xmath7 from equation ( [ r_b ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ semi - majoraxis ] ) allows us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of the captured dark matter particles . in figure",
    "[ denplot ] , we illustrate the local density of dark matter , taking the semi - major axis of the captured dark matter particle as a proxy for its position , as a function of distance from the sun . for comparison , the background galactic halo density is also shown .",
    "of particular note is the dark matter density at @xmath8 , which is greater than the background dark matter density ( from the underlying galactic halo ) by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "distance from the sun in our solar system at the present day .",
    "density is presented in units of @xmath10 , with distances given in units of @xmath11 . ]",
    "figure [ massplot ] indicates the total mass of dark matter enclosed within a certain radius from the sun due to both the captured dark matter and the underlying galactic halo . between approximately @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the amount of dark matter bound to the solar system is much more massive and dense than the background halo . within the orbit of mercury , earth , mars , and neptune , we find that approximately @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 of dark matter is enclosed , respectively .",
    "the total amount of matter dark bound to the solar system as the result of gravitational capture is @xmath18 , or @xmath19 earth masses .",
    "we predict the presence of a new component of dark matter within the solar system due to gravitational capture .",
    "we find that , within the orbit of neptune , @xmath20 of dark matter has become bound to our solar system due to the capture mechanism over its lifetime .",
    "this is about a factor of @xmath21 greater than the background mass from the galactic halo , as shown in figure [ massplot ] .",
    "the density of the captured dark matter is also significantly enhanced in comparison with the halo , as demonstrated in figure [ denplot ] . at the earth",
    "s orbital radius , density is enhanced by more than four orders of magnitude over the local halo density , with a value of @xmath22 .",
    "such elevated levels of dark matter have important implications for direct detection experiments and can be tested as a potential explanation for spacecraft anomalies .",
    "direct detection searches for dark matter rely predominantly on nuclear recoils @xcite , where the rate of interaction is dependent on the dark matter s density , velocity , and interaction cross - section ( which itself may have a velocity dependence ) .",
    "our determination of the local dark matter density and velocity distribution are of great importance to direct detection experiments .",
    "the most recent calculations that have been carried out assume that the properties of dark matter at the sun s location are derived directly from the galactic halo @xcite . by comparison , we find that terrestrial experiments should also consider a component of dark matter with a density @xmath23 times greater than the background halo density , albeit with a @xmath24 on the order of the earth s orbital speed @xmath25 , about a factor of seven smaller than the @xmath26-velocity of the unbound halo particles . if this dark matter is not efficiently ejected by future interactions after the initial capture , the gravitationally bound component of dark matter may wind up dominating the signal expected from future direct detection experiments .",
    "one method that has been used to constrain the amount of dark matter in the solar system has been careful , long - term observations of planetary and satellite motions .",
    "constraints have been obtained both from planetary orbital data @xcite and perihelion shift observations @xcite .",
    "the most stringent results for the dark matter density near earth constrain @xmath27 to be less than @xmath28 from orbital data @xcite .",
    "for the densities near mercury and mars , perihelion precession provides the tightest constraints , yielding upper limits on @xmath27 of @xmath29 near mercury and @xmath30 near mars @xcite .",
    "our results satisfy these constraints , as we predict the densities near mercury , earth , and mars to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "predictions about the effects of dark matter on planetary orbits are potentially observable , as the constraints on earth and our predictions differ by less than a factor of two .",
    "another interesting issue to address is the pioneer anomaly and the possibility that it has arisen due to the dark matter bound to our solar system .",
    "measurements show that pioneer 10 and 11 have exhibited extra accelerations towards the sun of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite . in order for dark matter to have caused this , at least @xmath36 of dark matter is required within @xmath37 of the sun @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the dark matter density capable of causing the anomalies is @xmath38 for an inelastic scattering of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "our results do not match either of these predictions , as we predict only @xmath39 of dark matter enclosed within the entire solar system and a dark matter density that never exceeds @xmath40 anywhere .",
    "we conclude that the pioneer anamoly can not be caused by dark matter that has been captured by our solar system .",
    "overall , we find that dark matter in our solar system is far more important than previously thought . due to gravitational three - body interactions between dark matter particles , the sun , and the planets , a significant amount of dark matter winds up gravitationally bound to our solar system , resulting in density enhancements between two and five orders of magnitude , depending on the distance from the sun .",
    "a future direction for this work is to include back - reaction effects , such as subsequent gravitational scatterings of the captured particles .",
    "these may prove to be important in ejecting a portion of the captured dark matter particles , and in reducing the total amount of dark matter that remains bound to our solar system .",
    "more accurate modeling of our galaxy s dark matter halo , such as the possible inclusion of a dark matter disk in the plane of our galaxy @xcite , will also alter the net amount of dark matter captured , and is worth further study .",
    "our results may lead to exciting new directions in direct detection experiments and our understanding of dark matter on the smallest scales .",
