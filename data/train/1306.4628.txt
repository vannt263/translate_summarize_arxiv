    "noncrossing partitions , first defined in g.  kreweras seminal paper  @xcite , have a vast literature in areas ranging from probability theory through polyhedral geometry to the study of coxeter groups .",
    "noncrossing partitions on a given number of elements are counted by the catalan numbers , if we also fix the number of parts , the answer to the resulting counting problem is given by the narayana numbers .",
    "a natural generalization of the problem of counting noncrossing partitions is to count partitions of a given genus .",
    "the genus of a partition may be defined in terms of a topological representation ( see  @xcite or @xcite for example ) , but there exists also a purely combinatorial definition of the genus of a hypermap ( thought of as a pair of permutations , generating a transitive permutation group ) that can be specialized first to hypermonopoles , or permutations ( that is , hypermaps whose first component is the circular permutation @xmath0 ) and then to partitions ( that , is permutations whose cycles may be written as lists whose elements are in increasing order ) . counting partitions of a given genus seems surprisingly hard , especially considering the fact that , for the closely related hypermonopoles , a general machinery was built by s.  cautis and d.  m.  jackson  @xcite and explicit formulas were given by a.  goupil and g.   schaeffer  @xcite . it should be noted that for genus zero , i.e. , noncrossing partitions , the notions of a hypermonopole ( in our language : permutation ) and of a partition coincide ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) .",
    "thus it seems hard to believe that the two notions would not only diverge but also give rise to counting problems of different difficulty in higher genus .",
    "asymptotic estimates for the numbers of noncrossing partitions on various surfaces may found in  @xcite .    concerning partitions of a fixed genus , a great deal of numerical evidence",
    "was collected in m.  yip s master s thesis , who made the following conjecture  ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 3.15 ) : the number of genus @xmath1 partitions on @xmath2 elements and @xmath3 parts is the same as the number of genus one permutations of @xmath4 elements having @xmath5 cycles . in this paper",
    "we prove this conjecture and provide further insight into the structure of genus @xmath1 partitions and permutations by representing them as four - colored noncrossing partitions .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . after reviewing some basic terminology and results on the genus of partitions and permutations in section  [ sec : genus ] , in section  [ sec:4cp ]",
    "we develop a theory of representing every permutation of genus @xmath1 by a four - colored noncrossing partition .",
    "the four colors form consecutive arcs in the circular order and prescribe a relabeling that results in a permutation of genus at most one .",
    "the construction is not unique , but we show that every permutation of genus @xmath1 may be represented in such a way . moreover , as we show it in section  [ sec : redpp ] , if the permutation of genus @xmath1 is _ reduced _ in the sense that it contains no cycle consisting of consecutive elements in the circular order ( we call these _ trivial cycles _ ) then we may select a unique four - colored noncrossing partition representation of our permutation which we call the canonical representation .",
    "this unicity enables us to count reduced permutations and partitions of genus @xmath1 in section  [ sec : enured ] .",
    "we only need to account for the possibility of having trivial cycles . in section  [ sec : red ] we show how to do this , at the level of ordinary generating functions , for any class of permutations that is closed under the removal and reinsertion of trivial cycles .",
    "since genus one permutations and partitions form such classes , we may combine the formula stated in theorem  [ thm : pd ] with the generating function formulas stated in section  [ sec : enured ] and obtain the generating function formulas counting genus @xmath1 permutations and partitions with given number of permuted elements and cycles .",
    "since the resulting formulas stated in theorems  [ thm : pnkgf ] and [ thm : pnkgfp ] differ only by a factor of @xmath6 , the validity of m.yips conjecture is at this point verified . in section  [ sec : yip ] we show how to extract the coefficients from our generating functions to find the number of partitions of genus @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted , that our paper thus also provides a new method to count permutations of genus @xmath1 , whose number was first found by a.  goupil and g.  schaeffer  @xcite . the generalized formula stated in section  [ sec : yip ] links the problem of counting genus @xmath1 permutations and partitions to the problem of counting type @xmath7 noncrossing partitions , convex polyominos and jacobi configurations ( at least numerically ) .",
    "the explanation of these connections , together with ideas of possible simplifications and further questions , are collected in the concluding section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "since the sixties combinatorialists considered permutations as a useful tool for representing graphs embedded in a topological surface .",
    "one of the main objects in this representation is the notion of a hypermap .",
    "a hypermap is a pair of permutations @xmath8 on a set of points @xmath9 , such that the group they generate is transitive , meaning that the graph with vertex set @xmath9 and edge set @xmath10 is connected .",
    "it was proved ( in @xcite ) that the number @xmath11 associated to a hypermap and defined by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the number of cycles of the permutation @xmath14 , is a non - negative integer .",
    "it is called the genus of the hypermap .    taking for @xmath15 the circular permutation @xmath16 such that for all @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 means @xmath1 ) allows to define the genus of a permutation @xmath20 as that of the hypermap @xmath21 .",
    "notice that the pair @xmath21 generates a transitive group for any @xmath14 since @xmath22 ; so that we may use the following definition :    [ def : permgenus ] the genus of a permutation @xmath14 is the non - negative integer @xmath23 given by : @xmath24    notice that hypermaps of the form @xmath21 are often called hypermonopoles ( for instance in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "a different definition of the genus was given in  @xcite , where the genus @xmath25 of the permutation @xmath14 is defined as the genus of the hypermap @xmath26 .",
    "in this definition a permutation is of genus @xmath27 if and only if it is a power of @xmath16 ; in ours permutations of genus @xmath27 correspond to noncrossing partitions , a central object in combinatorics .      to a partition @xmath28 of the set @xmath29",

    "the partition @xmath38 is represented in figure  [ fig : ncpart ] below .    ]      since the genus of a permutation @xmath14 is a function of @xmath13 , the number of its cycles , in the sequel we will consider permutations as products of their cycles , study their structure , and the effect of minor changes on the cycle structure . in particular",
    ", we will be interested in the change of the genus when we compose a permutation with a single _ transposition_. a transposition @xmath39 , exchanging the two points @xmath40 , will be denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "it has @xmath42 cycles of length @xmath1 and one of length @xmath37 , hence @xmath43 .",
    "note that we compose permutations right to left , i.e. , we define the product @xmath44 of two permutations as the permutation which sends @xmath17 into @xmath45 .",
    "we will often use the following lemma :    [ lemma : transpositions ] the number of cycles of the products @xmath46 and @xmath47 of a permutation @xmath14 and a transposition @xmath41 differs from the number of cycles of @xmath14 by @xmath1 .",
    "the sign of the change depends on whether @xmath17 and @xmath48 belong to the same cycle of @xmath14 or not .",
    "we have @xmath49    two cycles in a permutation @xmath14 are _ crossing _ if there exists two elements @xmath50 in one of them and @xmath51 in the other such that @xmath52 .",
    "observe that if such elements exist they may be taken such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "notice that a permutation is associated to a partition if and only if it contains no twisted cycle , moreover the partition and the associated permutation are of genus @xmath27 if and only if there are no crossing cycles .",
    "noncrossing partitions were extensively studied ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we define a four - coloring of a noncrossing partition of the set @xmath75 as a partitioning of the @xmath2 points on the circle into four arcs denoted @xmath76 , @xmath7 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in clockwise order where @xmath76 is the arc containing the point @xmath1 and in which @xmath77 is only arc allowed to contain no point .",
