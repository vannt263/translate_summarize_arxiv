    "particle - hopping models have been used widely in the recent years to study the spatio - temporal organization in systems of interacting particles driven far from equilibrium @xcite . often such models are formulated in terms of cellular automata ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "examples of such systems include vehicular traffic @xcite where the vehicles are represented by particles while their mutual influence is captured by the inter - particle interactions .",
    "usually , these inter - particle interactions tend to hinder their motions so that the _ average speed _ decreases _ monotonically _ with the increasing density of the particles . in the usual form of the fundamental diagram , i.e.  the flux - density relation",
    ", this non - monotonicity corresponds to the existence of an inflection point . in a recent letter @xcite",
    "we have reported a counter - example , motivated by the flux of ants in a trail @xcite , where , the average speed of the particles varies _ non - monotonically _ with their density because of the coupling of their dynamics with another dynamical variable . in @xcite",
    "we presented numerical evidences in support of this unusual feature of the model and indicated the physical origin of this behaviour in terms of a heuristic mean - field argument . in this paper",
    "we present the corresponding detailed _ analytical _ calculations , together with further numerical results , that provide deep insight into the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the ant - trail model @xcite is defined in section [ sec2 ] and compared with some closely related models in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "[ secclust ] presents results obtained from a microscopic cluster approximation .",
    "although this approach does not reproduce the observed sharp crossover it will help us to get a better understanding of the microscopic structure of the stationary state . a heuristic homogeneous mean - field theory , which was sketched briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite , is presented in detail in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "this theory produces better results than the cluster approximation .",
    "however , it accounts only for the _ qualitative _ features of the fundamental diagram obtained by computer simulations .",
    "therefore in section [ sec5 ] we present a new approach which leads to the main new results . in this section",
    "we have computed some new quantities that provide information as to the state of occupation of the site immediately in front of an ant .",
    "these quantities not only help us in identifying _",
    "three _ regimes of density , with corresponding characteristic features , but also provide insights that we exploit in developing a new scheme for analytical calculations .",
    "the results of this new scheme , that we call `` loose - cluster approximation '' ( for reasons which will be clear in section [ sec5 ] ) , are in reasonably good _ quantitative _ agreement with the data obtained from computer simulations .",
    "the effects of replacing the parallel updating by random sequential updating is explored in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec7 ] . in two appendices some details of the calculations for the cluster - theoretic approaches are given .",
    "the ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical ( generically called _ pheromone _ ) on the substrate as they crawl forward @xcite .",
    "although we can not smell it , the trail pheromone sticks to the substrate long enough for the other following sniffing ants to pick up its smell and follow the trail .",
    "ant trails may serve different purposes ( trunk trails , migratory routes ) and may also be used in a different way by different species .",
    "therefore one - way trails are observed as well as trails with counterflow of ants .",
    "in @xcite we developed a particle - hopping model , formulated in terms of stochastic ca @xcite , which may be interpreted as a model of unidirectional flow in an ant - trail .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , rather than addressing the question of the emergence of the ant - trail , we focus attention here on the traffic of ants on a trail which has already been formed .",
    "furthermore we have assumed unidirectional motion .",
    "the effects of counterflow , which are important for some species , will be investigated in the future .    ,",

    "also indicated are the pheromones that may evaporate in stage @xmath1 of the update scheme .",

    "[ fig-0 ] ) .",
    "the lattice sites are labelled by the index @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) ; @xmath4 being the length of the lattice .",
    "we associate two binary variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 with each site @xmath2 where @xmath5 takes the value @xmath7 or @xmath8 depending on whether the cell is empty or occupied by an ant .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 if the cell @xmath2 contains pheromone ; otherwise , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we have two subsets of dynamical variables in this model , namely , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the instantaneous state ( i.e. , the configuration ) of the system at any time is specified completely by the set @xmath13 .",

    "this representation is useful for the development of approximation schemes .",
    "in this section we compare the ant - trail model first with the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) model @xcite to show that in various limits it reduces to the ns model with different hopping probabilities .",
    "this comparison also helps in formulating the task of our analytical calculation from alternative perspectives .",
    "we also compare the ant - trail model with some other models all of which share a common feature : the dynamics of the `` particles '' are coupled to another dynamical variable .",
    "the ns model @xcite is the minimal particle - hopping model for vehicular traffic on freeways . in the general version of the ns model the particles , each of which represents a vehicle ,",
    "can have a maximum speed of @xmath40 .",
    "however , by the term ns model in this paper we shall always mean the ns model with @xmath41 , so that each particle can move forward , by one lattice spacing , with probability @xmath42 if the lattice site immediately in front is empty .",
    "the most important quantity of interest in the context of flow properties of the traffic models is the _ fundamental diagram _ ,",
    "i.e. , the flux - versus - density relation , where flux is the product of the density and the average speed . for a hopping probability @xmath42 at a given density @xmath43 the exact flux @xmath44 in the ns model",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath45 \\label{eq - nsflux}\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath46 in the deterministic limit @xmath47 .",
    "note that the expression ( [ eq - nsflux ] ) remains invariant under the interchange of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; this `` particle - hole '' symmetry of the ns model leads to a fundamental diagram that is symmetrical about @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast , the fundamental diagrams of our ant - trail model ( see fig .  [ fig - effh](b ) ) do not possess this symmetry except in the special cases of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite , in the two special cases @xmath51 and @xmath52 the ant - trail model becomes identical to the ns model with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , and , hence , recovers the particle - hole symmetry in these two special limits .",

    "a proper theory of the ant - trail model should reproduce the non - monotonic variation of the average speed with density ( shown in fig .",

    "in this paper we develope theories which , indeed , reproduce these features .      models with coupled dynamical variables",
    "have been considered earlier , for example , in the context of reaction - controlled diffusion @xcite . however , in this subsection we compare the ant - trail model with some more closely related models where the movement of the `` particles '' is totally asymmetric .    in the ant - trail model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite the particles , which represent the ants , move in a `` ground - potential landscape '' created by the pheromones .",
    "a similar approach has also been used for studying the human - trails of pedestrians @xcite .    in the ca model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for pedestrian dynamics , the floor - fields , albeit _ virtual _ , are analogs of the pheromone fields @xmath77 in the ant - trail model .",

    ", in our ant - trail model the pheromone field is `` fermionic '' as the variable @xmath78 , representing pheromones , can take only two values , namely , @xmath7 ( absence ) and @xmath8 ( presence ) .",
    "the ant - trail model we propose here is closely related to the bus route model @xcite with parallel updating @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we ll argue now , the ant - trail model and the bus route model are the two opposite limits of the same generalized version of the ns model of vehicular traffic .",
    "the ants are the analogs of the buses while the cells accomodating ants in the ant - trail model are analogs of the bus stops in the bus - route model .",
    "both the models involve two dynamical variables ; the variables @xmath79 and @xmath78 in the ant - trail model are the analogs of the variables representing the presence ( or absence ) of bus and passengers , respectively , in the bus route model . just as the number of buses is conserved in the bus - route model , the number of ants is also conserved in our ant - trail model .",
    "similarly , the dynamical variable representing the presence ( or absence ) of pheromone is not conserved in the ant - trail model just as the number of passangers is not conserved by the dynamics of the bus - route model .",
    "however , there is a crucial difference between these two models ; in the bus - route model @xmath80 ( as the buses must _ slow down _ to pick up the waiting passengers ) whereas in our ant - trail model @xmath81 ( because an ant is more likely to move forward if it smells pheromone ahead of it ) .",
    "in addition , the pheromone are _ dropped _ by ants ( whereas passengers arrive at the bus stops independent of the buses ) while passengers are _ picked up _ by buses ( whereas pheromones evaporate independently ) .",
    "the simulation results indicate that correlations between different ants as well as between ants and pheromone play an important role .",
    "we therefore develop a microscopic  ( 2 + 1)-cluster approximation @xcite which allows the inclusion of correlations between the occupation variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 of two successive sites @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( corresponds to `` 2 '' ) and that between the variables @xmath83 and @xmath86 at the same site @xmath85 ( corresponds to `` 1 '' ) in an exact way .",

    "the term `` loose '' means that there are small gaps in between successive ants in the cluster , and the cluster looks like an usual compact cluster if it is seen from a distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig - loose ] ) .",
    "in other words , a loose cluster is just a loose assembly of isolated ants .",
    "thus it corresponds to a space region with density larger than the average density @xmath48 , but smaller than the maximal density ( @xmath131 ) of a compact cluster .",
    "is the hopping probability of ants inside the loose cluster and @xmath132 is that of the leading ant . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    let us assume that the loose cluster becomes stationary after sufficient time has passed .",
    "then the hopping probability of all the ants , except the leading one , is assumed to be @xmath133 , while that of the leading one is @xmath132 ( see fig .  [ fig - loose ] ) ; the values of @xmath133 and @xmath132 are determined self - consistently , just as the effective hopping probability in the hmft was estimated self - consistently in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . before beginning the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us consider the properties of @xmath133 and @xmath132 . if @xmath25 is small enough , then @xmath133 will be close to @xmath76 because the gap between ants is quite small",
    ". on the other hand , if the density of ants is low enough , then @xmath132 will be very close to @xmath69 because the pheromone dropped by the leading ant would evaporate when the following ant arrives there .",
    "next we determine the typical size of the gap between successive ants in the cluster .",
    "we will estimate this by considering a simple time evolution beginning with an usual compact cluster ( with local density @xmath131 ) without any gap in between the ants .",
    "then the leading ant will move forward by one site over the time interval @xmath134",
    ". this hopping occurs repeatedly and in the interval of the successive hopping , the number of the following ants which will move one step is @xmath135 .",
    "thus , in the stationary state , strings ( compact clusters ) of length @xmath135 , separated from each other by one vacant site , will produced repeatedly by the ants ( see fig .  [ fig - avegap ] ) .",

    "interestingly , the density - independent average gap in the lca is consistent with the flat part ( i.e. , region  1 ) observed in computer simulations ( fig .",

    "in other words , the region  1 is dominated by loose clusters .    beyond region 1 ,",
    "the effect of pheromone of the last ant becomes dominant .",

    "we call this region as region 2 , in which the `` looser '' cluster is formed in the stationary state",
    ". it can be characterized by a negative gradient of the density dependence of the probability to find an ant in front of a cell occupied by an ant ( see fig .",

    "these equations can be applied to the region 1 and 2 , and solved simultaneously by the newton method .    total flux in this system",
    "is then calculated as follows .",
    "the effective density @xmath140 in the loose cluster is given by @xmath141 therefore , considering the fact that there are no ants in the part of the length @xmath142 , total flux @xmath55 is @xmath143 where @xmath144 is given by @xmath145    above the density @xmath146 , ants are assumed to be uniformly distributed , in which a kind of mfa works well .",
    "we call this region as region  3 .",
    "thus we have three typical regions in this model . in region 3 , the relation @xmath147 holds because all the gaps have the same length , i.e.  the state is homogeneous .",
