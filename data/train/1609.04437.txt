    "each approach has certain advantages .    designing a robust _ a posteriori _ error estimator for singularly perturbed equations is challenging , because the estimators usually depend on the small diffusion parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this problem was first investigated by verfrth @xcite , in which both upper and lower bounds for error estimator in an @xmath2-weighted energy norm was proposed .",
    "it was shown that the estimator was robust when the local pclet number is not very large .",
    "generalization of this approach can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "he considered also robust estimators in an ad hoc norm in @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "error estimation of singularly perturbed problems , it is crucial to employ an appropriate norm , since the efficiency of a robust estimator depends fully on the norm .",
    "du and zhang @xcite proposed a dual norm , which is induced by an @xmath2-weighted energy norm and a related @xmath26-norm . a uniformly robust _ a posteriori _",
    "estimator for the numerical error was obtained from the new norm .",
    "both theoretical and numerical results showed that the estimator performs better than the existing ones in the literature .",
    "it is well known that the _ a posteriori _ error estimators of the recovery type possess many appealing properties , including simplicity , university , and asymptotical exactness , which lead to their widespread adoption , especially in the engineering community ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , when applied to many problems of practical interest , such as interface singularities , discontinuities in the form of shock - like fronts , and of interior or boundary layers , they lose not only asymptotical exactness but also efficiency on relatively coarse meshes .",
    "they may overrefine regions where there are no error , and hence fail to reduce the global error ( see @xcite ) . to overcome this difficulty , cai and zhang @xcite developed a global recovery approach for the interface problem .",
    "the flux is recovered in @xmath0 conforming finite element ( fe ) spaces , such as the raviart - thomas ( rt ) or the brezzi - douglas - marini ( bdm ) spaces , by global weighted @xmath1-projection or local averaging .",
    "the resulting recovery - based ( implicit and explicit ) estimators are measured in the standard energy norm , which turned out to be robust if the diffusion coefficient is monotonically distributed .",
    "this approach was further extended for solving general second - order elliptic pdes @xcite .",
    "the implicit estimators based on the @xmath1-projection and @xmath0 recovery procedures were proposed to be the sum of the error in the standard energy norm and the error of the recovered flux in a weighted @xmath0 norm . the global reliability and",
    "the local efficiency bounds for these estimators were established .",
    "for singularly perturbed problems , the estimators developed in @xcite are not robust with respect to @xmath2 . to the authors knowledge",
    ", no robust recovery - type estimators have been proposed for such problems in the literature .",
    "motivated by aforementioned works , we extend the approach in @xcite and develop robust recovery - based _ a posteriori _ error estimators for the supg method for singularly perturbed problems .",
    "three procedures will be applied , which are the explicit recovery through local averaging in @xmath27 spaces , the implicit recovery based on the global weighted @xmath1-projection in @xmath27 and @xmath28 spaces , and the implicit @xmath0 recovery procedure .",
    "numerical errors will be measured in a dual norm presented in @xcite .",
    "note that these estimators are different from those in @xcite , since the jump in the normal component of the flux consists of a recovery indicator in addition to an incidental term ( see remark 4.1 ) .",
    "our recovery procedures are also different from those in @xcite ( e.g. , the flux recovery based on the local averaging provides an appropriate choice of weight factor , the @xmath0 recovery procedure develops a stabilization technique , the recovery procedures treat neumann boundary conditions properly , etc . )",

    ", we give a reliable upper bound for the numerical error in a dual norm developed in @xcite .",
    "section [ sec_analysis ] is devoted to the analysis of efficiency of the estimators . here , the efficiency is in the sense that the converse estimate of upper bound holds up to different higher order terms ( usually oscillations of data ) and a different multiplicative constant depends only on the shape of the mesh .",

    "the estimators work well even if pclet number is large , and the estimated errors of all three cases are convergent .",
    "as indicated in remark  [ rk : norms ] , we substitute @xmath114 with @xmath293 or @xmath115 to compute the effectivity indices .",
    "we point out that the performance of the true error @xmath114 is between that of @xmath115 and @xmath294 up to a multiple of a constant independent of @xmath178 and @xmath2 . to confirm this assertion , figure  [ aaaabb ] illustrates @xmath294 , the estimated error , and @xmath115 .",
    "it is observed that , in the convection - dominated regime , the behavior of the true error is very similar to that of @xmath115 and @xmath294 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to use @xmath115 or @xmath294 to approximate the true error @xmath114 when convection dominates . in table",
