    "the most simplistic candidate for dm would be a neutral component of an @xmath2 multiplet added to the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , which is dubbed as ewdm . in the case of a fermionic ewdm , its physical properties are completely determined by the gauge charge , dark matter mass , and mass differences between the multiplet components . as is well - known",
    ", the non - perturbative effect plays a crucial role when the dm is slowly moving and the dm mass is larger than the force - carrying boson mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this effect includes not only the usual sommerfeld enhancement but also the ramsauer - townsend suppression which are more apparent for larger dm mass or smaller mass gaps @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the non - perturbative effect of ewdm which is strongly constrained by the recent indirect detection data on anti - proton flux by ams-02 @xcite , gamma - ray measurement from milky way ( mw ) satellite dwarf galaxies by fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat )  @xcite , and gamma - ray line searches by fermi - lat @xcite and high energy spectroscopic system ( hess )  @xcite .",
    "the first two measurements put bounds on the leading - order annihilation processes : @xmath3 , and the last two on the loop - induced ones : @xmath4 .",
    "remark that the updated fermi - lat search on gamma - ray lines covers the dark matter mass up to around 500 gev complimenting the previous hess search range of 500 gev ",
    "related studies have been made for the case of the wino or wino - higgsino dark matter in a supersymmetric theory @xcite .",
    "the annihilation of two neutral particles into @xmath5 is a radiative process and may be subject to a large correction due to the resummation of electroweak sudakov logarithms @xmath6 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the sudakov resummation effect for the annihilation rate of the exclusive process @xmath7 and found that the exclusive rate is reduced by up to a factor of 2  3 compared to the tree - level plus sommerfeld enhancement calculation . on the other hand , refs .",
    "@xcite treated systematically the semi - inclusive annihilation rate into the final state @xmath8 within the resolution of the experiment to find that the effect of higher order correction is very limited as the semi - inclusive rate changes by only @xmath9 at @xmath10 tev .",
    "thus , we will simply use the leading - order annihilation cross section of ewdm including only the srt effect .    for our study",
    ", we will consider three specific examples of fermionic ewdm in the lowest - lying multiplets : a vector - like ( dirac ) doublet with a hypercharge @xmath11 ( higgsino - like ) , a ( majorana ) triplet with @xmath12 ( wino - like ) , and a vector - like ( dirac ) triplet with @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite , the feature of sommerfeld peaks and ramsauer - townsend dips in the non - perturbative annihilation cross section depends sensitively on those mass parameters , which leads to an interesting impact on the indirect detection constraints .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the non - perturbative effect , the srt effect for annihilations of ewdm summarizing the results in ref .  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the existing indirect constrains on annihilations of ewdm into sm gauge bosons based on various cosmic - ray measurements , then conclude in section iv .",
    "finally , in appendix a , we present the explicit forms of the potential and scattering matrices described in section ii .",
    "let us first make a brief summary of the non - perturbative effect on the ewdm annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the doublet ewdm ( higgsino - like ) consists of a dirac fermion pair denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the chiral representation .",
    "the lighter linear combination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the dm candidate and the mass splitting can come from ( effective ) non - renormalizable operators after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the wino - like ewdm multiplet , a triplet with @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath19 having only one majorana neutral component .",
    "finally , the triplet ewdm multiplet with @xmath13 consists of two chiral fermions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "recall that the electroweak one - loop correction generates a mass splitting of order 0.1 gev between the multiplet components @xcite .",
    "together with the above - mentioned ( tree - level ) contribution , this one - loop correction can make arbitrary mass gaps as assumed in our analysis .",
    "the non - perturbative effect in the ewdm annihilation arises from the exchange of the electroweak gauge bosons which mixes together the two - body states of the multiplet components . in the case of the doublet ewdm , there are three states formed by the charged ( dirac ) component and two neutral ( majorana ) components : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the dark matter component . for the wino - like",
    "ewdm , there are two two - body states : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the triplet ewdm with @xmath13 has four two - body states : @xmath28 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .    for the calculation of the non - perturbative effect",
    ", we apply the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite in which the green s functions @xmath29 corresponding to the transition between the two - body states @xmath30 and @xmath31 are shown to follow the schrdinger equation : @xmath32 with the boundary condition @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the total kinetic energy of the two initial dark matter particles in the annihilation process , where @xmath36 is the dm velocity .",
    "then , the non - perturbative annihilation cross section of the dark matter @xmath25 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the relative velocity between the two incident dm particles . here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 run over the gauge bosons @xmath42 , and the gauge boson final states @xmath43 can be @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 .",

    "the non - perturbative calculation of the ewdm annihilation exhibits not only the usual sommerfeld enhancement with resonance peaks , but also a vanishing cross section realizing the ramsauer - townsend effect for particular choices of the model parameters .",
    "these effects are particularly sensitive to the the mass splittings between the dark matter and the charged components of the multiplet , and can appear even for the dm mass below the tev scale when the mass splitting is reduced to @xmath50(10 ) mev or less .",
    "one can find a detailed analysis on non - perturbative effects on the annihilation cross section of the ewdm in ref .",
    "the appearance of the ramsauer - townsend dips is of a particular interest as it can allow the ewdm to evade strong constraints from various indirect detections .",
    "we first present constraints on ewdm from indirect signals by its annihilation into @xmath53 final states .",
    "annihilations of ewdm are expected to produce @xmath54 bosons plentifully since ewdm is charged under the su(2 ) symmetry of the sm .",
    "fragmentation of the produced @xmath54 bosons leads to sizable contributions to the antiproton flux and the continuum photon spectrum which are detectable in cosmic - ray measurement experiments such as ams-02 and fermi - lat .",
    "antiproton production from dm annihilations into @xmath51 and @xmath45 channels is constrained by the precise measurements on antiproton flux by ams-02  @xcite . the antiproton contribution from dm annihilation",
    "should be summed to the secondary antiprotons , produced by collisions of energetic cosmic - rays with the interstellar medium , which account for the bulk of the observed flux .",

    "the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way are some of the most promising targets for the dm indirect detection via gamma - rays since they are highly dm dominated objects with a relatively short distance from the earth . in ewdm annihilation ,",
    "the continuum photons originate mostly from fragmentation of hadronic final states in the @xmath61 processes which are strongly constrained by the gamma - ray measurements from the mw satellite dwarf galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the total mass of a dwarf galaxy within the half - light radius and the integrated j - factor , the line - of - sight integral through the dm distribution integrated over the solid angle for a region of interest , have been found to be pretty insensitive to the change of a dm density profile  @xcite .",
    "thus in ref .",
