    "we therefore calculate the local change @xmath148 in the stress tensor in every volume element during a small time interval and then study the size distribution of changes in the scalar variable @xmath149 calculated from @xmath148 ( note that @xmath149 is always positive , since it refers to the deviatioric stress of @xmath148 ) .",
    "in general , one expects @xmath150 to fluctuate even in the undriven case , and one should expect to find a stationary distribution of stress jumps over not too long timescales . since the glass is out of equilibrium , it is by construction not stationary and will exhibit aging phenomena , etc .",
    "such long timescales , however , are not explored here .",
    "[ backgroundjumps - fig ] shows an example of such stationary distributions for four different temperatures .",
    "the jumps correspond to an average change in local deviatoric stress in small regions over a time difference of @xmath151 .",
    "the narrowest distribution is found at the lowest temperature @xmath143 and the distribution widens as the temperature increases to @xmath64 .",
    "the cause for the stress jumps is obviously thermal motion of the particles , and only small excursions about their positions can occur in the glass ( cage effect ) .",
    "the part of the distribution at small values of @xmath150 can be fitted to a gaussian , but deviations become visible at large values .     for the _ unstrained _ binary lj glass at four temperatures @xmath143 ( solid line ) , @xmath152,@xmath144 and @xmath64 ( long dashed line , @xmath107 increases from left to right ) .",
    "@xmath150 was calculated for a time difference of @xmath151 .",
    "the distributions are stationary over @xmath153.,width=302 ]     for the binary lj glass _ sheared at @xmath139 _ for two temperatures @xmath143 and @xmath64 .",
    "different curves belong to strains of 0% , 2.5% , 4.5% and 7% ( see fig .",
    "[ stresstraindiffrates - fig ] ) . also shown as thick solid lines are the steady state distributions at the same rate as well as exponential fits ( dashed lines ) to the tail of those distributions.,width=302 ]    we are now able to determine how the distribution of stress jumps in the undriven system changes when the system is macroscopically strained . fig .",
    "[ drivenjumps - fig ] shows several distributions at the highest ( @xmath103 ) and lowest ( @xmath94 ) temperatures considered .",
    "@xmath150 was calculated for the same time difference @xmath151 .",
    "for each temperature , four distributions are shown , which correspond to four different strains between zero and the maximum shear yield strain .",
    "also shown for comparison are the distributions in steady shear .",
    "several observations can be made in this figure .",
    "note first that at @xmath64 , the unstrained distribution is not changed dramatically under external driving .",
    "only the tail at large jumps gets modified .",
    "this temperature is above @xmath56 and the shear rate is low enough that the deviation from newtonian behavior is small .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation at @xmath143 , where strain produces a dramatic increase in the number of large jumps .",
    "the tail of the distribution can be fit to an exponential form @xmath154 that extends to larger stresses as the strain increases to the peak in the stress - strain curve .",
    "the steady state stress results are close to those at a transient strain of 4.5% .",
    "the steady state probability curves decay with the characteristic stresses @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "the above results for the strain rate dependence of shear yielding offer an opportunity to test the theoretical models described in section [ theo - sec ] .",
    "the eyring model eq .",
    "( [ eyring - eq ] ) predicts a logarithmic dependence of @xmath81 , and the prefactor @xmath100 is given by @xmath159 .",
    "since we found typical values of @xmath100 between 0.02 and 0.03 for all temperatures , our result can only be reconciled with the eyring model if one allows for huge variations of the `` activation volume '' @xmath160 between @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath160 is a phenomenological fit parameter , but is typically interpreted as a characteristic volume for a local shear event .",
    "it should then be at least of order the volume per particle , i.e. of order @xmath163 or larger .",
    "the implied linear change in @xmath160 with @xmath107 would also be inconsistent with the observed linear temperature dependence of @xmath81 . from eq .",
    "( [ eyring - eq ] ) the stress would vary as @xmath164 , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "besides , the usefulness of the eyring expression is reduced if @xmath160 is allowed to be temperature dependent .    modern theories offer a different interpretation of the rate dependence .",
    "lematre s extension @xcite of the stz theory @xcite to include free volume relaxation produces complex rate dependence that could describe our results .",
    "however , the issue of temperature dependence has not been addressed in this approach and we have not examined the issue of free volume relaxation here .    a pure power - law shear thinning behavior was predicted in the calculations of berthier _ et al .",
    "starting from very different considerations , these authors found that the exponent @xmath49 should have a generic value of 1/3 at a transition temperature @xmath48 .",
    "below @xmath48 , the exponent should in principle be temperature dependent , but their numerical results indicated only a very weak dependence .",
    "both results are consistent with our findings near @xmath56 , but not at lower temperatures where we find a constant plus power - law behavior .",
    "below the glass transition temperature , the sgr model @xcite predicts such constant plus power - law behavior of the flow curve with an exponent of the form @xmath165 , where @xmath30 is an effective noise temperature in units where the glass transition temperature @xmath166 . in steady shear",
    ", we found good agreement with this functional form and an exponent @xmath167 .",
    "the authors of the sgr model go to great length in providing an interpretation for @xmath30 .",
    "they argue that in a sheared state , the energy for surmounting a barrier for rearrangement is not only provided by the thermal energy , but also by the energy released from rearrangements elsewhere in the material .",
    "this energy diffuses through the material and provides an effective thermal bath in a mean field sense . the energy released in such a rearrangement",
    "must therefore be of order of the typical yield energies , which implies that @xmath30 should be of order unity .",
    "when the yield energies are much larger than typical thermal energies , @xmath30 will be independent of the true thermodynamic temperature @xmath107 .",
    "our finding of an exponent independent of @xmath107 could thus be rationalized in this framework .",
    "our analysis of the distribution of local stress jumps could lend additional support to the concepts behind the sgr model .",
    "changes in the local deviatoric stress as shown in fig .",
    "[ drivenjumps - fig ] can activate yield events .",
    "we found that the distribution of stress jumps could be fitted to an exponential distribution with a characteristic decay stress that varied less than 30% as @xmath107 changed from @xmath168 to @xmath169 . at small values of @xmath170 ,",
    "the distribution retains the equilibrium form .",
    "this result suggests that the drive generates internal dynamics on a common scale despite very different thermodynamic temperatures and might provide a more microscopic justification of the background `` effective noise temperature '' proposed in the sgr model .",
    "the shear energy released by a yielding local region should indeed trigger additional yield events at other locations in the material .",
    "however , the ensuing dynamics may be more complicated than suggested by mean - field approaches . many models of material breakdown include load redistribution mechanisms . in fiber bundle models",
    "@xcite , for instance , one finds avalanche behavior that precedes total failure .",
    "the avalanche size distribution follows a power law . when shearing a material , however",
    ", a yielded region will typically reemerge with a different yield energy as assumed in the sgr model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simpler situation of an elastic network with random breaking thresholds of the links was subjected to an external drive .",
    "damaged elements were replaced with new ones with a different breaking threshold .",
    "power - law behavior in the size and duration of failure events was found .",
    "recent work on molecular @xcite as well as simplified models @xcite shows that load redistribution in the yielding glass mediated by elastic interactions between rearranging regions can lead to avalanche behavior .",
    "the ( transient ) maximum deviatoric shear stresses for two model glasses , binary lj mixtures and polymers , were shown to exhibit strikingly similar trends with rate and temperature .",
    "the rate dependence was remarkably constant from @xmath171 to temperatures 30 times lower .",
    "the entire flow curve shifted linearly to lower stress as @xmath107 increased . at low rates ,",
    "the rate dependence of the peak stress could be described by a logarithm or constant plus power - law , where the prefactor and/or exponent did not vary with temperature .",
    "a more rapid rise in stress was observed when strain rate was increased to @xmath76 .",
    "deviations in the elastic response also set in at this strain rate , indicating that stress could not relax throughout the system .",
    "this is not surprising given that the time to strain to 1% is comparable to that of sound propagation back and forth across the system .",
    "the stress for steady shear flow was calculated for the lj mixture .",
    "curves for different temperatures were also nearly parallel , shifting rigidly to lower stresses with increasing temperature . below strain rates of @xmath128 , the dependence of the flow stress on rate could be described by a logarithm .",
    "the entire flow curve could be fit by a constant plus power law with a temperature independent exponent @xmath167 .",
    "however , as for the transient stress , the stress begins to rise more rapidly at @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the emergence of a power - law vs. logarithmic behavior is related to the overlap of shear rate and stress equilibration timescales .",
    "although the system is in steady state , regions of a few atoms undergo a substantial yield event after of order 1% strain increments . at strain rates of @xmath86 and above",
    ", the time between these yield events will be too short for stress relaxation in our system .",
    "this point should be kept in mind when comparing molecular simulations to experiments at lower strain rates .",
    "the eyring model was shown to be incompatible even with logarithmic fits to the shear stress at low rates .",
    "it predicts that the prefactor of the logarithm should scale as @xmath172 , while the observed prefactor is nearly independent of temperature .",
    "fixing this discrepancy by requiring @xmath160 to scale linearly with @xmath107 leads to unphysically small values of @xmath160 and is inconsistent with the linear drop in yield stress with temperature at a given rate .",
    "the eyring model has been very helpful in analyzing experimental data , but typically over a narrow range of temperatures .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these measurements to very low temperatures and to higher shear rates .",
    "note that typical room temperature experimental values for @xmath160 in polymers correspond to 3 or 4 repeat units @xcite , which is of the same order as the values we find at @xmath173 or @xmath174 .",
    "the insensitivity of the rate dependence to temperature changes indicates that thermal activation is not dominant at the rates studied .",
    "analysis of the individual particle trajectories offers an explanation for this . even in the limit of zero temperature",
    "we find that the trajectories are exponentially sensitive to changes in rate and other parameters .",
    "the system does not travel along a single path through the energy landscape at different rates , but gets deflected between many possible paths by small perturbations .",
    "both the stz and sgr models describe complex dynamics in systems where temperature is unimportant .",
    "instead , activation is due to another internal state variable , either @xmath17 or @xmath30 , that couples to the external drive via a feedback mechanism .",
    "the original stz theory gives a simple linear rise in stress with rate above the yield stress @xcite .",
    "however recent generalizations @xcite can produce more complex rate dependence like that found here .",
    "the sgr model predicts a constant plus power - law behavior that is also consistent with our simulations and can account for a temperature independent exponent @xmath49 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the generating mechanism of structural disorder ( sgr ) or free volume dynamics ( stz ) provides a more useful description of glassy dynamics .",
    "an external drive introduces a new timescale into the problem that couples to the structural rearrangements .",
    "it will therefore modify the associated relaxation time scales and alter the unperturbed glassy dynamics , e.g to stop aging and induce rejuvenation @xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", this timescale should be the only one present in the system , while other competing timescales will arise at finite temperature .",
    "associated with this timescale is the concept of an effective temperature @xcite that also appears in the sgr model .",
    "while this picture is clearly a useful starting point , the analysis of the jump distribution has shown that the internal dynamics of the flowing glassy solid is much more intricate and strongly calls for extensions of analytical models beyond mean - field concepts .",
    "such a treatment should describe more accurately the load redistribution mechanisms and the propagation of released shear energy on a microscopic level .",
    "a preliminary analysis has shown that local plastic events occur in avalanches over a wide range of length and time scales .",
    "finally , we note that the above analytic models of glassy rheology and viscoplasticity are all scalar models that can not describe self - organization on larger length scales such as shear bands .",
    "tensorial versions of the stz theory are being discussed to address banding and necking @xcite .",
    "these are promising approaches that should continue to benefit from insight gained from molecular simulations , in particular the load redistribution mechanisms of shear yielding zones .",
