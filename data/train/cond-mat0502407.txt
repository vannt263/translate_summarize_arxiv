    "studies of lateral interactions between adsorbed particles are motivated by the need to understand the origin of the wide variety of ordered overlayers and phase transitions at fractional adsorbate coverage on metal surfaces .",
    "these interactions have contributions ranging from short - range and van der waals to long - range dipole - dipole , and lattice - mediated interactions  @xcite .",
    "hard - square short - range interactions and dipole - dipole long - range interactions are the major contributions to the lateral interactions for bromine adsorption on ag(100 )  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore the validity and applicability of such a model for adsorption of chlorine on ag(100 ) .",
    "halide electrosorption on single - crystal metal electrode surfaces is a good model system for studying the properties of the electrode - electrolyte interface in an electrochemical cell . due to its relative simplicity",
    ", it can be used to distinguish between the various contributions of different parameters according to the effect of their inclusion on the overall behavior of the system .",
    "a mean - field approach is not sufficient , even for the description of one of the simplest halide - electrosorption systems br / ag(100 ) .",
    "however , a simple lattice - gas model with constant parameters is sufficient to describe its equilibrium  @xcite , and dynamic  @xcite properties .",
    "while the electrosorption of br on single - crystal ag(100 ) from aqueous solution has been extensively studied as an example of adlayer formation in an electrochemical system  @xcite , less attention has been given to the electrosorption of cl  @xcite on ag(100 ) .",
    "a lattice - gas model with constant parameters is not sufficient to describe cl / ag(100 ) , therefore this system can be used to further investigate the nature and characteristics of the lateral interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms . in particular , we here develop a self - consistent picture of variable lattice - gas parameters based on the resident charge on the adatoms being coverage dependent or electrode - potential dependent ( through the coverage ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ]",
    "we describe an electrostatic model of the adlayer that is used in the simulations , the lateral interaction energies , and the monte carlo methods used .",
    "a brief description of the experimental procedure is given in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "the results of fitting the simulations to experimental data are detailed in section  [ sec : results ] , followed by a brief comparison with br / ag(100 ) in section  [ sec : compare ] .",

    ", we use a lattice - gas model , in which the lattice sites correspond to the adsorption sites .",
    "mitchell  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used an off - lattice model for the br / ag(100 ) system to show that the br adsorbates spend most of the time near the four - fold hollow sites of the ag(100 ) surface , thus justifying the lattice - gas treatment of halide adsorption . to describe the energy associated with a configuration of adsorbates on the surface , a grand - canonical effective hamiltonian  @xcite is used , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a sum over all pairs of sites , @xmath4 are the lateral interaction energies between particles on the @xmath5th and @xmath6th lattice sites , measured in mev / pair , @xmath7 is the electrochemical potential , measured in mev / particle , and @xmath8 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the local occupation variable @xmath9 is @xmath10 if site @xmath5 is occupied and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the long - range interactions , @xmath12 , depend on the distance , @xmath13 , between ions @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( measured in ag(100 ) lattice spacing units , @xmath14   @xcite ) as @xmath15 where the infinite value for @xmath16 indicates nearest - neighbor exclusion , and negative values of @xmath12 denote long - range repulsion .",
    "the coverage isotherms were simulated using a square @xmath17 lattice with periodic boundary conditions to reduce finite - size effects .",
    "the electrochemical potential @xmath18 is related to the bulk ionic concentration @xmath19 and the electrode potential @xmath20 ( measured in mv ) . in the dilute - solution approximation ,",
    "the relationship is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath23 is a reference concentration ( here taken to be @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the elementary charge unit  @xcite .",
    "the reference potential @xmath26 is chosen sufficiently negative such that the coverage vanishes at @xmath26 for all values of @xmath19 used , and @xmath27 has the sign convention that @xmath28 favors adsorption .",
    "the relationship between @xmath29 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is discussed further in the appendix .",
    "when cl ions adsorb on the surface , a fraction of their charge is transfered through the external circuit .",
    "this fraction , @xmath30 , is negative and is directly related to the average resident charge per ion , @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this relationship is an approximation and is more valid as the potential at the adsorbate approaches the value of the potential in the solution . for the current system s ionic strength , this condition is only approximately satisfied and may be considered as a source of error .",
    "we have previously shown  @xcite that for cl / ag(100 ) , the electrosorption valency @xmath0 depends on the coverage @xmath32 , which is defined as @xmath33 in order to investigate such a dependence more thoroughly , we here propose a model with a coverage - dependent next - nearest - neighbor lateral interaction energy @xmath1 , as well .",
    "this is motivated by two assumptions : that @xmath0 is coverage dependent and that the major contribution to @xmath1 is due to electrostatic dipole - dipole interactions . a simple electrostatic picture of the adlayer , in which an adsorbate s resident charge and its image charge form a dipole , suggests a relationship between the electrosorption valency and the dipole moment .",
    "if @xmath0 is coverage dependent ( @xmath34 ) , then the resident charge is also coverage dependent ( @xmath35 ) , and hence @xmath1 , which is proportional to @xmath36 , is coverage dependent as well ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath0 depends linearly on @xmath32 , @xmath38 the resident charge @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 and @xmath1 takes the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a prefactor proportional to the square of a `` dipole  distance '' .",
    "this effect is known as _ depolarization _ , and may under extreme conditions lead to the possibilty of a first - order phase transition  @xcite k. the model does produce a first - order transition at room temperature for some parameters that do not fit the experimental data . ] . if @xmath0 is coverage independent ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , then @xmath1 becomes coverage independent , as well .",
    "equilibrium monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were used to measure the equilibrium coverage as a function of @xmath29 , which was then converted to @xmath20 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbar ] ) .",
    "at each mc step a lattice site , @xmath5 , was chosen randomly , and a change in its occupation variable @xmath44 was attempted with a metropolis acceptance probability  @xcite : @xmath45\\ ; ,      \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the energy difference between the initial state and the proposed state .",
    "the value of @xmath1 was updated in the simulations at each mc step , corresponding to the new proposed coverage .",

    "the ag(100 ) single - crystal electrodes were chemically etched in cyanide solution , rinsed in milli - q water , and carefully annealed in a hydrogen flame .",
    "they were then quickly transfered into the electrochemical cell after cooling in a stream of argon . using the hanging meniscus technique , a platinum wire counter electrode , and a saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode ,",
    "the electrochemical measurements were carried out at a temperature of ( @xmath47)@xmath48c .",
    "for the chronocoulometric experiments , the potential was set at initial values between @xmath491.375 and @xmath490.300 v vs sce until adsorption equilibrium was established , and then stepped to the final potential of @xmath491.400 v , where the chloride is completely desorbed from the surface .",
    "the equilibrium mc simulations were performed at a temperature of @xmath50c for various values of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 was varied from @xmath11 to @xmath53 mev in steps of @xmath54 mev , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 were varied from @xmath11 to @xmath57 in steps of @xmath58 , resulting in @xmath59 different simulations .",
    "the resulting simulated isotherms were fitted to experimental data .",
    "this large number of simulations necessitated the choice of the relatively small system size with @xmath60 .",
    "the system displays a second - order phase transition from a disordered , low - density phase to an ordered @xmath61 phase  @xcite at an intermediate value of the electrochemical potential . for the steepest part of the isotherm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit ] ) , where critical slowing down due to the phase transition is important , the system was allowed to relax for a longer time to reach equilibrium than for the points further away from the phase transition .",
    "we checked for finite - size effects , and no significant difference was observed when comparing the resulting isotherms with isotherms simulated using larger system sizes of @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "a small value of @xmath64 can be used because @xmath32 is not the order parameter corresponding to the @xmath61 phase , and so its fluctuations , which are proportional to d@xmath65d@xmath29 , only diverge logarithmically with @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "in addition , better statistics were collected close to the phase transition , using longer runs and more sampling than for points far from the phase transition , where the fluctuations are smaller .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbar ] ) , the simulated isotherms were converted from the @xmath29 scale to the @xmath20 scale and then fit to the experimental isotherms .",
    "the fitting was done by varying the value of @xmath66 to minimize @xmath67 for each set of values for @xmath42 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . here , @xmath68 is the least - squares sum per degree of freedom , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the experimental and simulated coverages , respectively , corresponding to the same value of @xmath20 .",
    "linear interpolation was used between the simulated data points to calculate @xmath70 for all values of @xmath20 .    from fits to @xmath71 mm and @xmath72 mm experiments , a grid of of values of @xmath67 , was collected .",

    ".  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the third model studied was the coverage dependent model with @xmath74 , where no constraints on the values of any of the parameters were imposed , and the whole parameter space was searched for a global minimum .    a three - dimensional plot of the parameter space is shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : param](b ) is a projection onto the @xmath55 , @xmath56 plane , which shows that the minima are concentrated within one region close to the @xmath43 plane , suggesting a relatively weak dependence of @xmath0 on the coverage .",

    "figures  [ fig : param](c ) and  [ fig : param](d ) show that while the magnitude of @xmath55 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath42 , there is no general trend for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath42 .    due to the existence of several shallow minima of @xmath67 , and due to the limited resolution of the grid in parameter space , we list in table  1 the best - fit parameter values for each model , along with all fits that have @xmath67 within @xmath77 of the best - fit value",
    ". one can see in table  1 that there are two possible sets of parameters that fit to the 10  mm data for model  ( iii ) with mean - field - enhanced simulations . to discriminate between these possible fits to the 10  mm data we check if they are also possible fits to the 20  mm experimental data .",
    "the first set ( @xmath78 mev ) is the overall best fit for 10 mm .",

    "the only parameter set ( @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) that is a possible fit to both the 10  mm and 20  mm experimental data , is the accepted best fit for model  ( iii ) . using the same approach for the non - mean - field - enhanced method , models ( i ) and ( ii ) , and concentration , results in a unique set of parameter values for each model , simulation method , and concentration .",

    "also note that the fits for 10  mm are consistently better than the fits to the 20  mm experiments .",
    "this might be due to violation of the dilute - solution limit at the higher concentration .",
    "this may also be the reason that the values of @xmath82 , which are expected to be the same for both concentrations when fit to a single simulation , differ consistently by about @xmath83 mev between the concentrations .",
    "the values of @xmath42 are consistently less negative for the longer - ranged lateral interactions of the mean - field - enhanced than for the non - mean - field method .",

    "this value of @xmath89 is of the same order of magnitude as our value .    finally , although models ( i ) and ( ii ) are still possible , a self - consistent ( @xmath108 ) entirely electrostatic model not only fits better to the experimental data but also , with no constraints imposed , predicts values of @xmath0 that are reasonably compatible with those obtained from the experimental data using the method of ref .  @xcite .",
    "br electrosorption on the same substrate ag(100 ) displays different characteristics .",
    "the electrosorption valency and the next - nearest - neighbor lateral interaction energy are not only more negative , @xmath109 and @xmath110 mev , but also independent of the coverage  @xcite . in other words , while mutual depolarization  @xcite is present for cl / ag(100 ) , this effect is not significant for br / ag(100 ) .",
