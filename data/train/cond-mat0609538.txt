    "quasiclassical methods , developed several years ago and used successfully to describe non - equilibrium states in superconductors and superfluids ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , have recently been extended to meso- and nanoscopic systems .",
    "this became possible after the formulation of boundary conditions , including hybrid structures and interface roughness @xcite . in recent developments we focussed on spin - effects and spatial confinement , e.g. , concerning the spin - hall effect in a 2d electron gas @xcite , and spin relaxation in narrow wires in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite . within the quasiclassical approach ,",
    "it is also possible to study the influence of disorder and coulomb interaction on the same footing @xcite , which is manageable since the method works on an intermediate level : microscopic details of the wave - functions , on the scale of the interatomic distance , are integrated out , leaving equations of motion which can be solved with sufficient accuracy .    as an illustrative example , we apply in this paper the quasiclassical method to determine the equilibrium green s function , and hence the density of states ( dos ) , of the ( spinless ) 1d model known as luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "this model contains two fermionic branches , linearized near the fermi points , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 the bare fermi velocity and dos .",
    "only interaction processes with small ( @xmath3 ) momentum transfer are considered : standard parameters are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for scattering processes involving only one or both branches , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 are useful .",
    "the spectrum of charge fluctuations is linear , @xmath8 ; the renormalized velocity , @xmath9 , and the parameter @xmath10 , given by @xmath11^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\;\\ ; k =   \\left [ \\frac{1+\\gamma_4-\\gamma_2}{1+\\gamma_4+\\gamma_2 } \\right]^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] are often called luttinger liquid parameters .    in the following sect .",
    "2 we discuss the solution of the equation of motion for the quasiclassical green s function in the presence of a fluctuating potential , the latter representing the fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "the keldysh technique is employed throughout .",
    "considering the average  with respect to the fluctuating field  of the green s function and an analogy to the @xmath0 theory , the field fluctuations are related to an effective impedance of the luttinger liquid , and finally to the dos ( sect .",
    "3 ) . in sect .",
    "4 we consider an insulating boundary , i.e.  a reflecting wall , and determine the dos boundary exponent . a concluding discussion is given in sect .",
    "in essence , the keldysh technique @xcite differs from the zero - temperature and the matsubara approach by employing time - ordering along a contour which runs from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and back to @xmath12 . rewriting the theory in terms of standard ( @xmath14 ) integrations , a 2@xmath152 matrix structure results ; e.g. , the green s function can be cast into the form @xmath16 accordingly , considering some general 2-particle interaction @xmath17 and decoupling this interaction using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation within the path - integral formalism , two auxiliary fields are necessary . as a result , the green s function can be expressed as an average of the free - particle green s function in the presence of fluctuating potentials as follows ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath18 \\ , { \\rm e}^{{\\rm tr}\\ln ( \\check{1 } + \\check{g}_0 \\check{\\phi } ) } \\rangle_{0 , \\phi } = \\langle \\check{g}_0 [ \\phi ] \\rangle_\\phi\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the free - particle green s function , and @xmath20 = \\check{g}_0^{-1 } + \\check{\\phi}$ ] , where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the unit and the first pauli matrix , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the two potentials mentioned above . furthermore , @xmath26 denotes an average which is gaussian by construction , and defined such that @xmath27 where for clarity space ( @xmath28 ) and time ( @xmath29 ) arguments are included .",
    "the average @xmath30 , defined through eqs .  (",
    "[ av ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , can be non - gaussian .",
    "( the spin will be suppressed througout this paper . )",
    "note that a `` real '' electrical potential can be included by the replacement @xmath31 in @xmath32 $ ] of eq.([av ] ) ; the particle s charge is @xmath33 . in the next step ,",
    "we consider the quasiclassical approximation , i.e.  we consider the difference @xmath34 \\check{g}_0 [ \\phi ] -   \\check{g}_0 [ \\phi ] \\check{g}_0^{-1 } [ \\phi ] = 0 $ ] , keeping only the leading terms in the gradients with respect to the ( spatial ) center - of - mass coordinate ( which we again denote by @xmath28 ) .",
    "the equation is then integrated with respect to the magnitude of the momentum .",
    "the result is @xmath35 \\check{g}_{tt^\\prime}(\\hat{p}x )         = i [ \\check{\\phi } , \\check{g}]\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the direction of the center - of - mass momentum , and @xmath37 \\equiv   \\check{\\phi}(xt)\\check{g}_{tt^\\prime}(\\hat{p}x ) -",
    "\\check{g}_{tt^\\prime}(\\hat{p}x ) \\check{\\phi}(xt^\\prime ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath38 is the so - called quasiclassical green s function , @xmath39 a major advantage compared to the full green s function is the normalization , @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that in the quasiclassical approximation , only long - wavelength contibutions of the fluctuating fields are taken into account  which is adequate for the problem addressed below .",
    "in the 1d case , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . for the homogeneous equilibrium case , the solution is @xmath43 where the fourier transformed ( @xmath44 ) quantity is given , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 . a formal solution of eq .  ( [ equ ] )",
    "is found with the ansatz @xmath47 provided @xmath48 apparently , @xmath49 has the same matrix structure as @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 .",
    "for example , we obtain explicitly from ( [ ansatz ] ) : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 for brevity .",
    "we will discuss below that , for the luttinger model , it is sufficient to assume that the phases are gaussian distributed .",
    "it is then straightforward to determine @xmath56 ; for example , we obtain , but we nevertheless use the notation @xmath57 for brevity . ]",
    "@xmath58 \\\\     & = & - \\langle \\check{g}^a \\rangle_\\phi ( t^\\prime t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are even , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are odd under time reversal , @xmath64",
    ". then we define @xmath65 , such that @xmath66         \\left [ b(\\omega ) + 1 \\right ] \\left ( { \\rm e}^{-i\\omega t } -1 \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , and we used @xmath68 b ( \\omega)$ ] . from the relation @xmath69 we obtain @xmath70 , implying that @xmath71 is odd in frequency . combining the above relations , the ( normalized ) dos is given by @xmath72\\}_{t^\\prime=0 }     \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 1 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d\\omega \\ , f(\\epsilon - \\omega ) [ p(\\omega ) - p(-\\omega)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 note that @xmath74 , i.e.  @xmath75 .    in order to complete the argument ,",
    "the phase fluctuations are easily related to the potential fluctuations , according to the relation ( compare eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) ) @xmath76_{x = x^\\prime , t^\\prime = 0 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] and the potential fluctuation can be related to the interaction .",
    "this last step , however , requires some discussion .",
    "first , note that expanding the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ av ] ) up to second order , neglecting higher order terms , corresponds to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . given this ( gaussian ) approximation , the procedure for performing the phase average , outlined above ,",
    "is permitted . as an important point , however , _ the rpa is known to be exact for calculating the density response of the luttinger model _ , and hence the effective interaction , which concludes the argument : the potential fluctuations are given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the screened ( rpa ) interaction .",
    "thus @xmath79 in an obvious short - hand notation .",
    "the approach described in the preceding section is very similar to the theory of charge tunneling in ultrasmall junctions , as reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite , which is also known as @xmath0 theory .",
    "( see also @xcite for related articles . ) in this context , the quantity @xmath0 characterizes the influence of the environment on the tunneling between the two electrodes .",
    "for example , the forward tunneling rate is found to be given by @xmath80 \\ , p(e - e^\\prime ) \\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the voltage , @xmath82 the tunneling resistance , and @xmath83 the fermi function .",
    "note the detailed balance condition @xmath84 .",
    "physically , @xmath0 describes the probability of exchanging the energy @xmath85 with the environment @xcite .    on the other hand , in the present context , consider the tunneling rate from the interacting one - dimensional wire into a non - interacting lead , which clearly is given by @xmath86\\ ] ] with @xmath87 the normalized dos as given in eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) . using this equation as well as the properties of @xmath88 as described in the previous section and the detailed balance condition , it is straightforward to confirm that eqs .",
    "( [ forward ] ) and ( [ forwardb ] ) coincide , provided @xmath0 from the tunneling theory is identified with @xmath88 .",
    "the reason for the complete correspondence between these two quantities is apparent on physical grounds , since the quantity @xmath88 characterizing the luttinger liquid arises from the auxiliary potential fluctuations due to the fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "in the zero - temperature limit , one finds easily @xmath89 exploiting the analogy further , we identify @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the klitzing constant , and we may call @xmath92 effective impedance of the luttinger liquid . for the simple example of an ohmic impedance with a high - frequency cut - off @xmath93 the result is @xcite @xmath94^{2/g }               \\quad\\quad ( t=0 , \\ ,      0<\\omega < \\omega_r)\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is euler s constant .",
    "thus the dos is found to vanish at the fermi energy , @xmath96 , where the exponent is given by @xmath97\\right\\}_{\\omega\\to 0 }                =   -i \\left\\ { \\frac{\\omega}{\\pi } \\int \\frac{dq}{2\\pi }       \\frac{v^r(q\\omega)}{(-i\\omega + 0 + i q v_f)^2 } \\right\\}_{\\omega\\to 0}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the screened retarded interaction . in order to determine this quantity , consider the 2@xmath152 matrix structure of right- and left - moving particles , denoted by `` @xmath99 '' and `` @xmath100 '' , the bare interaction and the non - interacting response function : @xmath101 as well as the rpa equation @xmath102 .",
    "this matrix structure implies that we have to introduce a branch index for the fluctuating fields , which we suppressed up to now : @xmath103 .",
    "the density of states of the right - moving particles , for example , is determined from the @xmath104-@xmath104 correlation functions .",
    "the relevant quantity , @xmath105 , is straightforwardly determined and inserted into eq .",
    "( [ 2overg ] ) ; the @xmath106-integral can be done by contour integration , and we obtain the standard @xcite result : is denoted by @xmath107 , which we avoid here since we prefer to use the latter symbol for the dimensionless conductance , see eq .",
    "( [ ohmic ] ) , in accordance with the @xmath0 theory @xcite . ]",
    "near a boundary or an interface the quasiclassical approximation is insufficient , and the quasiclassical propagators pointing into or out of the boundary ( or interface ) have to be connected by boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition is particularly simple for spinless fermions in one dimension at an impenetrable wall : obviously @xmath109 , to ensure that there is no current through the wall .    in the following",
    "we assume that the wall is located at @xmath110 , and that the particles move in the half - space @xmath111 . instead of considering two branches of fermions in this half - space ,",
    "we find it more convenient to mirror the left movers at the boundary and to consider only right movers in the full space , i.e.@xmath112 this green s function solves eq .",
    "( [ equ ] ) both for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the bare interaction is now given in real space by @xmath115 the fourier transfrom of @xmath17 is thus off - diagonal in momentum space , since the @xmath5-term couples @xmath106 with @xmath116 .",
    "considering now the 2@xmath152 matrix structure of particles with momentum @xmath106 and @xmath116 , the bare interaction is @xmath117 i.e.  identical to what was given in eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) above with just a different meaning of the matrix index .",
    "also the non - interacting response function and the rpa equation for the screended interaction are the same as before . due to the absence of translation symmetry",
    "the effective impedance depends on the distance from the boundary , and is given by @xmath118 \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\left [   k + k^{-1}-2   + \\cos ( 2 \\omega x/ v ) ( k^{-1}-k ) \\right ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the density of states at the boundary is found to vanish as @xmath119 in agreement with the boundary exponent obtained in @xcite , and the impurity exponent given in @xcite .",
    "in fact this result has been considerably debated @xcite ; compare also @xcite , as well as the detailed presentation by von delft and schoeller @xcite .",
    "quasiclassical theory is known to be a useful tool in the theoretical description of superconductors and superfluids , including non - equilibrium states and interfaces . for normal - conducting electrons the theory mainly serves for the microscopic foundation of a boltzmann - like transport theory . however",
    ", when taking into account the coulomb interaction in terms of a fluctuating hubbard - stratonovich field , the theory also captures important interaction effects , which are beyond the reach of the boltzmann equation . in this article we illustrated this by considering the one - dimensional version of the theory , and demonstrated that it is possible to describe the non - fermi liquid physics of luttinger liquids .",
    "the mathematics involved is very similar to the @xmath0 theory of tunneling , which we made use of in this article , and also to the functional bosonization approach to luttinger liquids @xcite ( which we did not exploit here ) .",
    "we concentrated on the spinless case and on thermal equilibrium ; the spin is straightforwardly included in the theory , and clearly  since we use the keldysh formalism ",
    "non - equilibrium situations can be covered as well .",
    "we are confident that in the future the quasiclassical theory will become a useful , complementary approach to transport in interacting one - dimensional systems .",
