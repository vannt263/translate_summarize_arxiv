    "by exploiting the fine control of interactions through a magnetically tuned feshbach resonance  @xcite , ultracold atomic fermi gases have proven to be a rich arena in which to study many - body physics .",
    "on one side of the feshbach resonance the effective s - wave interaction is attractive , which has allowed investigators to realize a bcs state of cooper pairs . if the interactions are tuned across the feshbach resonance , the fermions bind to form molecules that can subsequently form a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "however , the fermions experience repulsive interactions if the feshbach resonance is approached from the other side",
    ". a recent experiment by the mit group  @xcite on the repulsive side of the resonance has provided the first tentative evidence for the formation of an itinerant ferromagnetic phase .",
    "there was however a significant atom loss process that could drive the formation of alternative strongly correlated states  @xcite , which are consistent with some of the experimental results .",
    "it is therefore essential to develop a different realization of the ferromagnetic state which suppresses atom loss , and in addition delivers unique experimental signatures to help resolve the outstanding questions over the original experiment .",
    "if the experiment were confirmed  @xcite , the flexibility offered by ultracold atomic gases now presents investigators with a unique opportunity to study aspects of ferromagnetism that can not be envisioned in the solid state , including the consequences of population imbalance  @xcite , a conserved net magnetization  @xcite , the damping of quantum fluctuations by three - body loss  @xcite , single spin flips  @xcite , spin drag  @xcite , spin spiral formation  @xcite , reduced dimensionality  @xcite , as well as ferromagnetic phenomena in an optical lattice  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we turn to consider the consequences of the up and down - spin particles carrying different masses , a scenario that can not be realized in the solid state .",
    "furthermore the system offers investigators a lower atom loss rate combined with inimitable experimental signatures .",
    "the mit experiment prepared an ultracold atomic gas with two different atomic species to represent the pseudo up and down spin fermions . in the experiment , and",
    "all theoretical studies of itinerant ferromagnetism to date , the two species are different electronic states of the same atom , and therefore carry the same mass .",
    "this accurately reflects the situation in solid state ferromagnetism where the up and down - spin electrons have the same effective mass .",
    "however , the flexibility introduced by the new experimental realization of ferromagnetism permits the pseudo up and down spins to be represented by two species of atoms of different elements with unequal masses ; alternatively an optical lattice can change the effective mass of the atoms .",
    "though in the solid state interactions can change the effective mass of the majority and minority spin species  @xcite , distinct species of fermions in an ultracold atomic gas provide a cleaner and more controlled realization of mass imbalance .",
    "furthermore , introducing a mass ratio breaks the su(2 ) symmetry of the conventional ferromagnet , and as a result the magnetization has anisotropic susceptibility and so offers a novel control parameter over magnetic ordering and unique experimental signatures of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "moreover , introducing a mass imbalance should suppress the three - body losses that hinder ultracold atom experiments  @xcite .",
    "further motivation to study a generalized mass ratio stems from novel physics discovered on the attractive side of the feshbach resonance .",
    "it has been established that imbalanced fermi surfaces in a superfluid can drive the formation of the textured fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov phase  @xcite , and here we explore the opportunity that new phenomena could arise in a mass imbalanced itinerant ferromagnet .    in this paper in sec .",

    "therefore , the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a solid platform from which to investigate itinerant ferromagnetism with a mass imbalance .",

    "we use the notation @xmath3 with inverse temperature @xmath4 , and dispersion @xmath5 .",
    "it will later be convenient to rewrite the particle masses as @xmath6 , and the species chemical potentials as @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is a label to distinguish between the two species of atoms and does not represent a physical spin .",
    "we now decouple the quartic interaction term , which will allow us to integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "hertz did this by introducing a scalar hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the two - body interaction term into the magnetization channel  @xcite . by expanding in the magnetization he was able to develop an effective landau theory .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that this approach fails to recover the correct hartree - fock equations , and capture the behavior of the soft transverse degrees of freedom  @xcite . moreover , as mass imbalance breaks the su(2 ) symmetry of the system , magnetization formed along the quantization axis is distinctly different from perpendicular magnetization .",
    "we therefore adapt the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and decouple the quartic interaction term in the full vector magnetization @xmath9 as well as the density channel @xmath10 .",

    "[ sec : phase - diagram ] and analytically in sec .",
    "[ sec : perppol ] that any gas with a mass and/or chemical potential imbalance breaks the su(2 ) symmetry and does not develop perpendicular magnetization , so @xmath22 .",
    "this result considerably simplifies the mean - field equations .",
    "as the particle densities are related to the saddle point fields through @xmath23 , at zero temperature we cast the mean - field equations as @xmath24 which shows that the fermi energy of the @xmath25 species is @xmath26 .",
    "this equation forms the backbone of our subsequent analysis .",
    "we first use it to derive a generalized stoner criterion for the ferromagnetic instability in a mass imbalanced gas .",
    "such a transition is characterized by the appearance of three nearby solutions ; the now unstable original state , and two with small relative positive and negative polarization . demanding the existence of these solutions to the self - consistent equations yields a modified stoner criterion @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 is a density of states at the @xmath25 species fermi surface .",
    "this reduces to the familiar criterion @xmath29 in the mass and population balanced limit  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : texturedphase ] we show that the saddle point fields are always uniform , even for general chemical potential and mass imbalance . therefore , unlike the superfluid regime where a fermi surface imbalance can drive the formation of the textured fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov state @xcite , here for a perfectly spherical fermi surface and the absence of nesting only uniform ferromagnetic states",
    "will be formed .",
    "we note however that fluctuation corrections drive textured phase formation in the equal mass case  @xcite , and have the potential to do the same with mass imbalance .",
    "now that we have prepared the formalism we are ideally placed to study the phase diagram of the mass imbalanced fermi gas with repulsive interactions . this will allow us to build up an intuition for the consequences of mass imbalance before we turn to study the gas in a harmonic trap in sec .",

    "the result is that @xmath46 is smaller than @xmath47 at zero interaction , and decreases more rapidly with increasing interaction strength .",
