    "<S> tau neutrino and antineutrino interactions with nucleons in large underground or under ice detectors will be important signals of astrophysical and atmospheric sources of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a theoretical update of the deep inelastic scattering contribution to the tau neutrino and antineutrino charged current cross sections with isoscalar nucleon targets and proton targets for incident neutrinos and antineutrinos in the energy range from 10 gev to 10 tev . </S>",
    "<S> next - to - leading order quantum chromodynamic corrections , target mass corrections and heavy quark effects are included . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the cross section associated with the structure functions a low momentum transfers , the input parton distribution functions , scale dependence and flavor number scheme are discussed . </S>"
