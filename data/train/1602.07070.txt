    "these distances are @xmath43the diameter of the central region ( n - s direction ) , and thus the ne / sw emission is unlikely significantly contaminated by the side - lobes of the central region . indeed , for the ne / sw region , there is no obvious enhancement in the alma simulated images compared with the observed one .",

    "the mid point between the two separate co concentrations in the nucleus has a systemic velocity of @xmath14790kms@xmath6 . from this mid point , the underlying ( projected ) rotational velocity increases radially out , to a value of a few tens of kms@xmath6  seen at the outer edge of the nuclear gas .",

    "this overall kinematic pattern can also been seen in the channel maps displayed in figure [ figchannel ] , where channels are overlaid on the integrated line emission image .",
    "the co(6@xmath35 )  emission in the ne and sw regions coincide well with the dust lane associated with the inner spiral arms as seen in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) optical image of gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , suggesting that the observed rotational velocity field likely reflects the galactic rotation .    figure [ figmom]d shows that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is from @xmath130 to 50kms@xmath6  in the central region , around 20kms@xmath6  in the ne region , and between 10 and 20kms@xmath6  in the sw region .",
    "however , the core of the sw region has a large velocity dispersion , as high as @xmath150kms@xmath6 .",
    "figures [ figpv]a-[figpv]d present the integrated co(6@xmath35 )  line profiles for the 3 regions as well as for the total alma detection , together with the central velocity and fwhm from a gaussian fit",
    ". the central velocities are consistent with a systematic rotation that has a projected velocity of 12 to 15kms@xmath6  at the radii of ne or sw . among the three regions , the sw one has the broadest line width , consistent with its large velocity dispersion seen in figure 1d .",
    "the fwhm of the total line emission in figure  3d is similar to that of co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) ( albrecht et al .  2007 ) .    the total flux of co(6@xmath35 )  measured from the integrated image",
    "is @xmath5jykms@xmath6 , which agrees well with our spire / fts - measured flux of @xmath44jykms@xmath6  ( lu et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) , obtained with a much larger aperture of @xmath133@xmath45 . the central ( @xmath1@xmath46 in diameter ; or @xmath1530pc ) region contains @xmath150% of the total alma - detected emission , and the ne and sw regions about 20% and 30% respectively .",
    "these results suggest that our alma observation has recovered all of the co(6@xmath35 )  emission in ngc 7130 .      as shown in figure",
    "[ figmom]b , the 434@xmath4 m  continuum emission generally correlates spatially with the co(6@xmath35 )  emission in ngc 7130 , but with two notable differences over smaller scales : ( 1 ) the brightest peaks of the nuclear continuum and co(6@xmath35 )  line emission have a small offset of @xmath10@xmath45.2 ( or @xmath170 pc ) .",
    "( 2 ) the average line - to - continuum ratio ( @xmath47 ) is particularly high in the sw region compared to those in the central or ne regions .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath47 are 2100 ( sw ) , 1700 ( ne ) and 1300 ( central ) , suggesting an intrinsically faint 434@xmath4 m  flux density in the sw region . in star forming regions , the dust emission is always dominated by far - uv photon heating in the photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) near young massive stars . by contrast , the dominant heating mechanism for the co(6@xmath35 )  emission is still controversial despite the fact that its heating source should still be associated with the on - going sf on a global scale ( lu et al .",
    "the observed differences between the dust continuum and co(6 - 5 ) emission at small scales may lend direct support to the notion that shocks ( or other mechanical energy input ) are mainly responsible for the warm co emission as often suggested by many authors who modeled the observed co spectral line energy distributions in galaxies ( e.g. , nikola et al .",
    "2011 ; rangwala et al .",
    "2011 ; kamenetzky et al .",
    "2012 ; meijerink et al .  2013",
    "; rosenberg et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "this can be better understood in a simplified analytical way : the co(6@xmath35 )  to continuum ratio , @xmath48 , equals @xmath49 . in the inner galaxy where most of the gas is molecular ( e.g. , tanaka et al . 2014 ) ,",
    "@xmath50 scales with the total gas mass ( @xmath51 ) ; @xmath52 is likely in or near the rayleigh - jeans limit and thus scales approximately with the dust mass ( @xmath53 ) times the effective dust temperature ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 is more or less fixed , a higher @xmath48 ratio can result from a higher co excitation or / and a lower @xmath54 . if both co(6@xmath35 )  and dust emissions are tied to the same pdr mechanism , their emission peaks should coincide with each other spatially .",
    "this is not consistent with our data at scales @xmath57pc .",
    "furthermore , if supernova - driven shocks are responsible for the co(6@xmath35 )  emission , the high @xmath48 ratio in the sw region could be associated with the epoch when the o stars ( with lifetimes of several times @xmath58 years ) from the last starburst episode have burned off , leading to a lower @xmath54 .",
    "since supernova progenitors are less massive ( down to @xmath1@xmath59 ) and have longer lifetimes ( up to @xmath1@xmath60 years ) , the @xmath61 ratio could still remain high , leading to a higher @xmath48 ratio .",
    "this picture is overall consistent with the observations that the gas in the sw region displays a complex velocity field and little pa-@xmath8 emission ( see fig .  4 below ) .",
    "however , there exists another possibility that the ne / sw gas were excited by bar - induced shocks , which can inhibit star formation when the shock and shear is too strong ( e.g. athanassoula 1992 ; reynaud & downes 1998 ) .",
    "our alma - detected flux density of the continuum at 434@xmath4 m  is @xmath62mjy . following a similar procedure ( i.e. , interpolating the spire measurements at 350 and 500@xmath4 m  to obtain the total flux ) in xu et al .",
    "( 2014 , 2015 ) , we estimated about @xmath63 of the total dust continuum is detected by our alma observation , which is lower by a factor of about 2 than the interferometer - to - single - dish flux ratio of the co(6@xmath35 )  line emission .",
    "this result indicates that the dust distribution is substantially more extended or more diffuse overall than that of the warm dense gas .",
    "figures [ figcomp]a - d display the integrated co(6@xmath35 )  line emission contours overlaid on the _ hst _",
    "f210 m ( uv ) ( gonzlez delgado et al . 1998 ) , f160w continuum and pa-@xmath8 ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 ; diz - santos et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the vla 8.4ghz continuum images ( thean et al . 2000 ) , respectively .",
    "the extinction - corrected pa-@xmath8 map was obtained from a set of _ hst _ near - ir ( nir ) narrow- and broad - band images ( diz - santos et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the radio image was obtained by reducing the raw data downloaded from the nrao vla science archive .",
    "the elongated beam ( due to the target being in the southern sky ) , using a uniform weighting , has a size of @xmath64 .",
    "the maximum recoverable scale for this snapshot observation is about @xmath65 , very close to our alma observation .",
    "the astrometry of these _ hst _ observations has been improved by utilizing the 2mass point source catalog and the ring - like feature identified in gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "furthermore , we have also assumed that the nucleus seen in the f160w peak coincides with the radio peak since an agn usually peaks at the nucleus which is the bottom of the gravitational potential well .",
    "indeed gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) identified the optical peak ( which correlates with the f160w - band ) as the nucleus .",
    "this way , we can match alma and nir maps to an accuracy of @xmath66 , dominated by the alma / radio offset .",
    "figure [ figcomp]a shows that , the clumps in the uv image have offsets relative to the dense gas emission , which may be caused by extinction since the uv data are heavily obscured ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , and/or by the break in the local sf law ( xu et al . 2015 ) .",
    "the western peak in the co(6@xmath35 )  image seems to be complementary to the ring - like structure shown in the uv image .",
    "figure [ figcomp]b reveals that the two dust lanes , which run in the north - south direction and are also seen in the optical image ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , coincide well with our co(6@xmath35 )  emission ( sw and ne regions ) .",
    "this indicates that our method for improving the astrometry of the _ hst _ images is reasonable .",
    "furthermore , the dust lanes and ne / sw gas offset towards the leading sides of the inner bar , which can be identified in the @xmath67-band image and is oriented at @xmath68 ( mulchaey et al .",
    "this result is consistent with numerical simulations ( e.g. athanassoula 1992 ) that in the presence of a barred potential , gas will hit the bar from behind and shock , forming a dust - lane , and then the gas will fall inward along the bar .",
    "the shocks can heat gas much more efficiently than dust .",
    "therefore , both the observed gas morphology and high co(6 - 5)-to - continuum ratio indicate that the ne / sw gas might have been accumulated through bar - induced gas inflow .    from figure",
    "[ figcomp]c it is evident that the pa-@xmath8 emission varies smoothly with radius , and and has no clumps corresponding to the ones seen in the central region of the co(6@xmath35 )  image .",
    "unless the extinction correction is severely uncertain , our result indicates a breakdown of the correlation between sf and warm dense gas at sub-100pc scales , which has been found in ngc 1614 ( xu et al .",
    "2015 ; but see wu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for opposite results ) .",
    "nevertheless , a quantitative analysis , using a higher - quality radio image , is needed to reach a solid conclusion since the extinction correction for the pa-@xmath8 image may suffer from some uncertainties .",
    "the only peak seen in the radio continuum image ( figure [ figcomp]d ) is close to the eastern clumps of the co(6@xmath35 )  emission ( central region ) .",
    "there is no detectable radio emission for the ne and sw regions @xmath12@xmath45 away from the central region seen in co(6@xmath35 ) , whereas liu et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found that there is no difference in the global fir and radio correlations with dense gas and co emission .",
    "the majority of and the peak emission of the radio map may correspond to the agn , as a compact radio core has been detected in ngc 7130 at 2.3ghz ( corbett et al .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that , for star - forming regions in ngc 1614 , the average co(6@xmath35)-to - radio flux ratio ( @xmath69 ) is @xmath70kms@xmath6 , and for ngc 34 , whose agn contribution to the radio continuum is negligible ( corbett et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath71kms@xmath6 .",
    "for the western knot ( i.e. the western peak of the co emission in the central region ) in the radio map , @xmath69 is @xmath72kms@xmath6 .",
    "whereas for the region centered at the radio peak ( measured within an ellipse of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) in ngc 7130 , it is @xmath75kms@xmath6 , @xmath15 times lower than the forementioned values , indicating a significant enhancement of the radio emission in this region .    assuming that the x - ray dominated region associated with the agn is unresolved by alma , we measured the co(6@xmath35 )  flux within the region ( @xmath76 ; hereafter a@xmath77 ) centered at the radio peak and found that it only accounts for @xmath115% of our alma - detected flux within the central region , or @xmath17% of the total flux of the entire galaxy",
    "however , there might be contribution from massive stars to the heating of co(6@xmath35 )  in a@xmath77 .",
    "so it is an upper limit of the agn contribution to the co(6@xmath35 )  heating .",
    "our results are also consistent with the finding in lu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , i.e. , _ sf rather than agn dominates the excitation of mid - j co emission_. the spectrum extracted within a@xmath77 has a central velocity of 4799kms@xmath6  and fwhm of 86.4kms@xmath6 , which are @xmath17kms@xmath6  and 12kms@xmath6  larger and smaller , respectively , than those of the spectrum from the entire central region .",
    "however , unlike the optical lines from the nucleus ( e.g. davies et al . 2014 ) , no extended wing was detected in all of our co(6@xmath35 )  spectra ( see figure [ figpv ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we presented the initial results from our alma band-9 imaging spectroscopy of ngc7130 with the following main findings : ( a ) half of the co(6@xmath35 )  emission is contained in a clumpy nuclear region of @xmath1500pc in diameter and with the rest in two symmetrically placed structures at distances of @xmath1500 pc from the nucleus , coinciding with the optical dust lanes along the inner spiral arms .",
    "( b ) the co(6@xmath35)-emiting gas appears to participate in the general rotation of the galaxy disk .",
    "( c ) while the co(6@xmath35 )  emission and the 434@xmath4 m  dust continuum are spatially correlated at large scales , there is a @xmath170 pc offset between their emission peaks , suggesting that the two emissions might become decoupled at this characteristic scale .",
    "( d ) while the agn in ngc7130 likely dominates the radio continuum emission , the radio continuum has a poor spatial correspondence with the co(6@xmath35 )  emission , confirming our earlier conclusion that agn heating plays an insignificant role in the mid - j co line emission .",

    "<S> in this paper , we report our high - resolution ( @xmath0 or @xmath1@xmath2pc ) observations of the co(6@xmath35 )  line emission , which probes warm and dense molecular gas , and the 434@xmath4 m  dust continuum in the nuclear region of ngc 7130 , obtained with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) . </S>",
    "<S> the co line and dust continuum fluxes detected in our alma observations are @xmath5jykms@xmath6  and @xmath7mjy , respectively , which account for 100% and 51% of their total respective fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the co(6@xmath35 )  and dust emissions are generally spatially correlated , but their brightest peaks show an offset of @xmath170pc , suggesting that the gas and dust emissions may start decoupling at this physical scale . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest peak of the co(6@xmath35 )  emission does not spatially correspond to the radio continuum peak , which is likely dominated by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with our additional quantitative analysis , suggests that the heating contribution of the agn to the co(6@xmath35 )  emission in ngc 7130 is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the co(6@xmath35 )  and the extinction - corrected pa-@xmath8 maps display striking differences , suggestive of either a breakdown of the correlation between warm dense gas and star formation at linear scales of @xmath9100pc or a large uncertainty in our extinction correction to the observed pa-@xmath8 image . over a larger scale of @xmath12.1kpc , the double - lobed structure found in the co(6@xmath35 )  </S>",
    "<S> emission agrees well with the dust lanes in the optical / near - infrared images . </S>"
