    "protostellar jets represent one of the most intriguing signposts of star formation ( for recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "they are highly supersonic and collimated , and some with wiggles in their trajectories .",
    "they are seen with knotty and bow - like shock structures .",
    "they can be launched from accretion disks around protostars , allowing us to probe the accretion process closest to the protostars .",
    "two competing yet similar mhd models , the x - wind model @xcite and disk - wind model @xcite , have been proposed to launch these jets .",
    "preliminary measurements of specific angular momentum of some jets are consistent with these two models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "polarization observations also suggest that the jets could be magnetized @xcite , as predicted in the two models .",
    "therefore , more detailed studies of the jet properties are needed to determine the jet launching model , and thus the accretion process closest to the protostars .",
    "molecular outflows are shell - like structures surrounding the jets and thus can be used to probe the physical properties of the jets indirectly .",
    "they are believed to be outflow cavity walls consisting mainly of the ambient material swept - up by the bow shocks in the jets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since some molecular outflows show wide - opening cavity walls near the protostars , especially in the later stage of star formation @xcite , an additional unseen wide - angle tenuous winds might be required . indeed",
    ", current theoretical jet models also predict such winds surrounding the highly collimated jets @xcite . however , more observations are still needed to confirm this possibility , especially in the early phase of star formation .",
    "this paper is a follow - up study to our previous submillimeter array ( sma ) study of the hh 212 jet and outflow system @xcite , presenting our study in sio and co with atacama millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) at an angular resolution of @xmath0 with more than 10 times higher sensitivity .",
    "hh 212 system is nearby in the l1630 cloud of orion at a distance of @xmath0 400 pc .",
    "its jet was discovered in shock excited 2 emission @xcite .",
    "it is powered by a low - luminosity ( @xmath0 9 @xmath4 ) class 0 protostar iras 05413 - 0104 .",
    "it interacts with the ambient material , driving a collimated co outflow around it @xcite .",
    "a rotationally supported disk is believed to have formed around the protostar in order to launch the jet @xcite .",
    "lying close to the plane of the sky ( @xmath5 5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the jet is one of the best candidates to investigate the jet properties . here , we refine the proper motion and thus the mass - loss rate of the jet .",
    "we study the shock structures in the jet , the morphological relationship between the co outflow and the jet , and discuss if there is a need of a wide - angle tenuous wind around the jet .",
    "the jet has a small semi - periodical wiggle .",
    "we model the wiggle and discuss possible origins for the wiggle .",
    "note that the small jet rotation tentatively found at higher resolution of @xmath0 in sio @xcite can not be confirmed here at a lower resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "observations of the hh 212 protostellar system were carried out with alma on 2012 december 1 during the early science cycle 0 phase .",
    "the details of these observations have been reported in @xcite , and thus only important information is reported here .",
    "a 9-pointing mosaic was used to observe the jet in this system within @xmath0 from the central source . both co j=3 - 2 and sio j=8 - 7 lines were observed at a velocity resolution of @xmath0 0.21 per channel . with super - uniform weighting ,",
    "the synthesized beam has a size of @xmath6 at a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath0 20 in sio , and @xmath6 at a p.a .",
    "of 43 in co. the rms noise level is @xmath0 7.7 ( i.e. , 0.32 k ) for the sio channel maps , and @xmath0 7.2 ( i.e. , 0.28 k ) for the co channel maps .",
    "the velocities in the channel maps are lsr . the systemic velocity in this region is assumed to be @xmath7 lsr , as in @xcite .",
    "the central source is assumed to be at the peak position of the continuum , which is @xmath8 , @xmath9 , as in @xcite .",
    "in order to provide readers with a more complete picture of the jet and outflow system , our alma maps are plotted together with an earlier h@xmath10 map of the jet .",
    "also , for a better view , all the maps are rotated by 22.5 clockwise so that the jet axis is aligned with the y - axis .",
    "the h@xmath10 map shows that the jet consists of a chain of knots and bow shocks , and sinuous ( continuous ) structures in between .",
    "it was made by combining the 3 observations in october 2000 , october 2001 , and january 2002 @xcite , and is thus roughly 11 years earlier than our alma observations . since the proper motion of the jet",
    "is estimated to be @xmath0 per year later here in our paper , the 2 jet must have moved down the jet axis by @xmath0 , as compared to the jet seen in our alma maps .",
    "since this position shift is smaller than the size of a knot ( @xmath11 ) , the 2 map can still be used to show the rough positions of the knots , bow shocks , and sinuous structures to be compared with our alma maps .",
    "with alma , co emission can now be mapped at higher angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "figure [ fig : co_chan ] shows the co maps from blueshifted to redshifted velocities ( with a velocity interval of 4.23 ) in comparison to the 2 map .",
    "the blueshifted emission is mainly to the north and redshifted mainly to the south of the central source .",
    "nested shell structures are seen extending to the north and south from the central source .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : co_shell ] , the nested shell structures can be better seen in the co maps integrated over selected velocity ranges that show the shell structures . in the south ( figure [ fig : co_shell]a ) , a wide - opening shell is seen opening to the south from the central source , connecting to the big bow shock sb3 further out . likewise in the north",
    "( figure [ fig : co_shell]b ) , a similar wide - opening shell is seen opening to the north , connecting to the big bow shock nb3 further out .",
    "these wide - opening shells are also seen in the lower transition line of co at j=2 - 1 @xcite , likely tracing the outflow cavity walls consisting mainly of the ambient material swept up by the big bow shocks . at the base around the central source ( see the zoom - in in figure [ fig : co_chanzoom]c ) , the shells fit right into the bay of the flattened envelope detected in 350 ghz continuum @xcite .",
    "this morphological relationship suggests that the shells , as they expand , are sweeping up and thus excavating the flattened envelope at the base .    inside these wide - opening shells ,",
    "internal shells are seen connecting to bow shocks nb1/2 and sb1/2 from the central source ( figure [ fig : co_shell ] ) . here",
    "internal shells are referred as the shells located inside the cavity walls @xcite . in the north , the internal shell",
    "is also affected by the wings of bow shocks nk7 and nk8 inside the shell ( figure [ fig : co_chan]c - g ) . inside these shells , co emission is also seen surrounding other smaller knots closer to the source , forming narrow internal shells around them .",
    "these inner shells are better seen as we zoom in to the inner part at low velocities as shown in figure [ fig : co_chanzoom ] . for the prominent pair of knots ,",
    "nk1 and sk1 , where the shocks are strong , hollow internal shells are clearly seen connecting to them ( figs [ fig : co_chanzoom]b and d ) , as seen earlier in @xcite . in summary ,",
    "nested shells are seen in co connecting to the bow shocks and knots , driven by them .",
    "figure [ fig : jet ] shows the maps of the sio emission and high - velocity ( hv ) co emission in comparison to the 2 map . as compared to the previous sma maps in @xcite , the maps here are created using slightly larger velocity ranges , because alma detected the emission in slightly larger velocity ranges at higher sensitivity . for the sio map ,",
    "we use the velocity from @xmath1223.03 to 17.53 , instead of @xmath1221.1 to 16 . for the co map ,",
    "low - velocity emission is excluded to avoid the shell contamination . on the blueshifted side ,",
    "we use the velocity from @xmath1221.65 to @xmath128.95 , instead of @xmath1218.4 to @xmath127.1 . on the redshifted side",
    ", we use 9.56 to 18.77 , instead of 3.4 to 13.3 .",
    "notice that the high - velocity ranges are not symmetric with respect to the systemic velocity because the jet has a higher mean velocity and a larger velocity range on the blueshifted side than the redshifted side ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably due to different inclination angles of the jet in the northern and southern parts * @xcite*. as found in @xcite , both sio emission and hv co emissions trace the jet well , arising from the sinuous structures and knots in the jet seen in h@xmath10 .",
    "notice that since the h@xmath10 map was made earlier , the sio and co emission peaks are seen slightly ahead of the h@xmath10 emission peaks .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the jet has a slight bending of @xmath0 1.5 to the west and a small semi - periodical wiggle in the trajectory .    due to higher sensitivity of alma ,",
    "sio emission becomes better detected toward the central source position , as compared to that seen in @xcite , likely arising from the jet base near the source as seen in the lower transition line of sio at j=5 - 4 @xcite .",
    "also , the jet appears to be more continuous in co , especially in the northern part .",
    "in addition , three more knots are detected along the jet axis in the south , where no clear h@xmath10 knot was detected .",
    "one is detected in sio and co in between knots sk5 and sk7 , and is thus labeled as knot sk6 as a counterpart of knot nk6 in the north .",
    "two are detected in co in between knots sk6 and sk7 , linking the two knots .",
    "the 2 and co emission seen in between nk6 and nk7 could be their counterparts in the north .",
    "for the prominent knot sk1 where the shock is strong , the sio emission is seen only at the bow tip , while the co emission is seen mainly in the bow shock wings .",
    "the limb - brightened bow wings structure of the co emission can be seen at lower velocity ( figure [ fig : co_chanzoom]d ) .",
    "similar morphology is also seen in l 1157 in @xcite , probably because co is destroyed or excited to higher transition lines at the tip where the shock is stronger .",
    "the jet can also be seen at lower velocity ( see figure [ fig : co_chan ] ) because of the low inclination angle of the jet to the plane of the sky .",
    "interestingly , at higher angular resolution and sensitivity , the co emission at 5.86 appears to show a helical structure along the jet axis in the south ( see figure [ fig : co_chanzoom]d ) that is not seen before . this helical structure is actually consisted of a chain of small and similar - size bow shocks curving back to the jet axis , associated with the knots ( sk2 , sk3 , sk4 , and sk5 ) in the jet",
    ". the bow wings are faint in the west , causing them to appear as a helical structure . in addition , a faint jetlike structure can also be seen along the jet axis in between knots sk3 and sk4 at this velocity , tracing the jet itself .",
    "sio emission also shows the similar bow shocks curving back to the jet axis ( see figure [ fig : jet]b ) .",
    "this feature has been seen in the simulations of a pulsed jet , both unmagnetized @xcite and magnetized @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a pulsed wide - angle wind would produce a chain of wide bow shocks that do not curve back to the jet axis @xcite , inconsistent with our observations .",
    "since the knots in the jet are well traced by the sio emission , proper motion of the jet can be estimated by measuring the position shifts of their sio emission peaks with respect to those seen at @xmath0 6 years earlier in our previous sma map in @xcite .",
    "we first convolved our previous sma sio map to the resolution of our alma map and then aligned the two maps with the continuum peaks .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : proper ] , the jet pattern is similar in the two epochs , in agreement with the pattern being propagating with the jet velocity . only the knots that are resolved and have well defined peaks are used for the measurement , with their emission peak positions marked with the solid lines .",
    "the innermost pair of knots , ss and sn , are not used for the measurement because they are spatially unresolved in our alma observations , appearing as jetlike structures .",
    "thus , the mean position shift is estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the proper motion is estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath3 per year , giving rise to a tangential velocity of @xmath0 115@xmath13 .",
    "since the jet is almost in the plane of the sky , the jet velocity can be approximated to this tangential velocity .      with",
    "better estimated jet velocity and better resolved co emission than those reported before in @xcite , we can refine the jet density and thus the mass - loss rate .",
    "the co emission of the jet in between knot nk1 to knot nk5 appears continuous and smooth ( see figure [ fig : jet]c ) , and thus can be used to derive the mean jet density .",
    "the mean co intensity there is found to be @xmath0 1.2 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the mean excitation temperature of the co emission can be assumed to be @xmath0 50 k. since the brightness temperature in the jet is mostly @xmath5 20 k , the co emission can be assumed to be optically thin .",
    "assuming lte , the column density of co is estimated to be @xmath14 .",
    "the mean jet ( 2 volume ) density can be derived from the co column density using the conversion equation , e.g. , eq .",
    "17 in @xcite . with a co abundance of @xmath15 and a jet diameter of @xmath0 @xcite ,",
    "the mean jet density is estimated to be @xmath16 , similar to the mean value derived from in @xcite .",
    "thus , the ( two - sided ) mass - loss rate would be @xmath17 yr@xmath18 .",
    "since the accretion rate has been estimated to be @xmath19 yr@xmath18 @xcite , the mass - loss rate is estimated to be @xmath0 20% of the accretion rate , reasonably consistent with the x - wind model ( @xmath0 30% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the disk - wind model ( @xmath0 10% , * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed earlier , the knots in the southern jet are seen with small bow shocks , with their bow wings curving back to the jet axis .",
    "knots sk4 and sk5 are reasonably resolved , allowing us to study the formation mechanism of the bow shocks . for knot",
    "sk5 , the co emission peak appears clearly upstream of ( i.e. , closer to the central source than ) the sio emission peak ( figure [ fig : sk4_5]a ) . for knot sk4",
    ", the co emission peak appears only slightly upstream of the sio emission peak by * or * @xmath0 15% of the beam size , and thus higher resolution observations are needed to confirm it . in sio ,",
    "the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram cut along the jet axis shows an arclike pv structure for each knot , with an apex at the velocity of @xmath0 9 pointing away from the source , as shown in figure [ fig : sk4_5]b .",
    "as we move away from the apex , either to higher velocity or to lower velocity , the pv structure bends slightly toward the source direction , forming the arclike pv structure .",
    "the co emission shows a similar pv structure slightly upstream of that of the sio emission .",
    "note that the co emission is missing from @xmath0 8 to 10 due to a foreground cloud at those velocities . in the northern jet ,",
    "the knots are not spatially resolved and thus no clear bow - like structures can be seen in sio and co. higher resolution observations are needed to study them .",
    "arclike pv structure has been seen in pulsed jet simulations ( see e.g. , figure 16a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in those simulations",
    ", even though the jet source is continuously ejecting material with a constant density , a ( sinusoidal ) variation in the ejection velocity produces an internal working surface ( iws ) in the jet @xcite .",
    "the iws can appear as a small arclike knot , with its velocity increasing toward its two edges from the jet axis ( see figure [ fig : iws ] and also figure 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , producing the arclike pv structure .",
    "as its shocked material is ejected sideways into the outflow cavity , it forms a bow shock , with the bow wings curving back to the jet axis @xcite , like those of knots sk4 and sk5 ( see section [ sec : jet ] ) .",
    "therefore , knots sk4 and sk5 likely trace the iwss in the jet .",
    "a bigger variation in the jet velocity would produce faster and more massive sideways ejection , forming stronger bow shocks @xcite , such as sk1 , nk1 , nb1/2 and",
    "sb1/2 , and thus bigger internal shells extending backward to the central source from their bow wings , as seen in the pulsed jet simulations in @xcite and @xcite .    sideways ejection has been claimed in another jet source iras 04166 + 2706 @xcite . in that jet ,",
    "a sawtooth pattern was seen in the pv diagram cut along the jet axis in co and sio , and it was argued to be produced by the sideways ejection of the shocked material in the iwss . that jet is highly inclined with an inclination angle of @xmath0 45 to the plane of the sky .",
    "viewing the iwss at high inclination angle produces the sawtooth pv pattern , as predicted in the simulated pv diagram at high inclination angle in @xcite . here the hh 212 jet is almost in the plane of the sky with a small inclination angle , thus the sideways ejection forms the arclike pv structures in the pv diagram .",
    "in addition to a collimated jet , an unseen wide - angle wind seems to be needed in driving molecular outflows in the later stage of star formation @xcite .",
    "is a wide - angle wind also needed in the early phase of star formation as in hh 212 ?",
    "recently , a wide - angle flow has been seen in c@xmath20s and may suggest a presence of a wide - angle wind @xcite .",
    "this wide - angle flow has also been seen earlier in @xcite and it may trace the cavity walls instead . in addition , a wide - angle wind , if exists , would produce wide bow - shocks and thus wide internal shells @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with our observations , which show highly curved bow shocks and narrow shells driven by the knots .",
    "therefore , in this source the wide - angle wind , if exists , is not significant enough to affect the structures of the bow shocks and the shells .",
    "this is not inconsistent with current jet launching models @xcite , which predict a wide - angle wind much more tenuous and thus less significant than the central jet . in the later phase ,",
    "the jet is much tenuous , so that the contribution of the wide - angle wind could become more important @xcite .",
    "the jet wiggle can be better seen after combining the co and sio maps of alma with the 2 map , as shown in figure [ fig : wiggle ] .",
    "the northern jet is continuous and the wiggle is reasonably well defined .",
    "the southern jet appears to be continuous only up to knot sk2 at @xmath0 @xmath12 , and thus the wiggle is not so well defined . comparing the sinuous structures in between knots sk1 and sk2 to those in between knots nk1 and nk2",
    ", the wiggle in the southern jet could be roughly point - symmetric to that in the northern jet .",
    "therefore , we first model the wiggle in the northern jet and then apply the model to the southern jet assuming a point - symmetric wiggle about the central source .    a possible mechanism to produce a point - symmetric wiggle is the jet precession @xcite .",
    "in this case , the amplitude of the wiggle , @xmath21 , will increase linearly with the distance , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 measures the distance of the jet from the source along the jet axis . here",
    "@xmath24 is the half - opening angle of the wiggle , so that @xmath25 gives the rate of the growth in the amplitude with the distance .",
    "the wiggle appears to be semi - periodical and thus can be assumed to be given by the following sinusoidal model @xmath26 where @xmath27 measures the displacement of the jet perpendicular from the jet axis .",
    "@xmath28 is the wavelength of the wiggle and @xmath29 is the phase angle at the source .",
    "based on the wiggle of the northern jet , the best parameters are @xmath30 0.5@xmath30.2 , @xmath31 @xmath3 ( or 2240@xmath3400 au ) , and @xmath32 0@xmath350 . since the jet velocity is @xmath0 115 , the period of the wiggle is @xmath0 93 years .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : wiggle]a , the model can roughly reproduce the wiggle of both the northern and southern jet in the inner part , but it seems to predict a larger wiggle than the observed in the outer part with @xmath33 .    in order to improve the model ,",
    "the amplitude of the wiggle is assumed to first increase linearly with the distance and then remain constant at @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 as shown in figure [ fig : wiggle]b , the model with @xmath36 ( 4000 au ) can give a better match up to @xmath0 ( i.e. , 6 cycles of wiggle ) in the northern jet and up to @xmath0 in the southern jet , where the sio and co emission were detected . at @xmath37 , the amplitude of the wiggle reaches the maximum value of @xmath38 , roughly the same as the jet radius , which is also @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "note that , since the southern jet does not have continuous structure beyond @xmath0 @xmath12 from the source , further observations are still needed to confirm that the wiggle of the jet is really point symmetric about the central source .",
    "observations at higher angular resolution are also needed to refine the value of @xmath39 .",
    "if the wiggle is really point - symmetric about the central source , then one way to produce the wiggle is the jet precession due a tidal interaction of a binary companion on the disk of the jet source @xcite .",
    "however , if this is the case , the amplitude of the wiggle is expected to grow with the distance @xcite , inconsistent with our observations .",
    "another possibility is the current - driven kink instability @xcite since the jet is expected to be magnetized with a helical magnetic field morphology @xcite . in this case",
    ", the amplitude of the wiggle is expected to grow at the beginning , and then become saturated and thus remain roughly constant at large distance , see , e.g , figure 3 in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , the wiggle is more like oscillation and thus could be semi - periodical . both of these are roughly consistent with what we observe here in our jet . however , the wiggle is not expected to show any symmetry about the central source .",
    "this might be ok because the jet wiggle here might not be point - symmetric , as mentioned earlier .",
    "in addition , the detailed jet structure here already appears to be different between the northern jet and southern jet . for the kink instability to take place",
    ", we have the kruskal - shafranov criterion @xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the maximum displacement @xmath41 and the wiggle wavelength @xmath42",
    ", we have @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , this kink instability , if in action , could be initiated in the central part of the jet , where the magnetic field is dominated by the poloidal field @xcite .",
    "this poloidal field could serve a  backbone \" to stabilize the jet @xcite .",
    "the toroidal field dominates only near the jet edges in order to collimated the jet .",
    "we have mapped the hh 212 jet and outflow system in the sio ( j=8 - 7 ) and co ( j=3 - 2 ) lines .",
    "our primary conclusions are the following :    * although the jet is seen with knots and bow shocks , the underlying jet is continuous , especially in the northern side . * the proper motion of the jet",
    "is estimated to be @xmath0 115@xmath350 .",
    "the mass - loss rate in the jet is refined to be @xmath0 @xmath44 yr@xmath18 , as expected for a class 0 source . *",
    "some knots are seen associated with small bow shocks , with their bow wings curving back to the jet axis .",
    "two of them , e.g. , knots sk4 and sk5 , are reasonably resolved , showing kinematics consistent with sideways ejection , likely tracing the internal working surfaces formed in a collimated jet due to a temporal variation in the jet velocity .",
    "their bow shocks are formed by this sideways ejection . *",
    "the jet has a small semi - periodical wiggle , with a period of @xmath0 93 yrs .",
    "the amplitude of the wiggle first increases with the distance and then stays roughly constant .",
    "a jet precession may have difficulty to explain this kind of wiggle .",
    "one possible origin of the wiggle could be the kink instability in a magnetized jet .",
    "* nested ( internal ) shells are seen in co connecting to the knots and bow shocks , driven by them .",
    "the sideways ejection ejects material into the outflow cavity from the knots , forming the bow shocks and the internal shells .",
    "* the internal shells of the knots are narrow and the bow shocks of the knots curve back to the jet axis , both suggesting that the wide - angle wind , if exists , is insignificant as compared to the jet .",
