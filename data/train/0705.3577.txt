    "the discovery of superconductivity in cept@xmath0si ( ref . ) has renewed interest , both experimental and theoretical , in the properties of superconductors without inversion symmetry .",
    "the list of such superconductors has been steadily growing and now also includes uir ( ref . ) , cerhsi@xmath0 ( ref . ) , ceirsi@xmath0 ( ref . ) , y@xmath1c@xmath0 ( ref . ) , li@xmath1(pd@xmath2,pt@xmath3)@xmath0b ( ref . ) , and other materials .",
    "a distinctive feature of noncentrosymmetric crystals is that the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling qualitatively changes the nature of single - electron states , namely it lifts spin degeneracy and splits energy bands almost everywhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "this has important consequences for superconductivity . in the limit of strong so coupling",
    ", the cooper pairing between the electrons with opposite momenta occurs only if they are from the same nondegenerate band . according to ref .",
    ", this is what happens in cept@xmath0si , where the so band splitting ranges from 500k to 2000k and thus exceeds the critical temperature @xmath4k by orders of magnitude .",
    "the same is likely to be the case in other materials , for instance li@xmath1pd@xmath0b and li@xmath1pt@xmath0b , see ref . .",
    "the pairing interaction in the strong so coupling case is most naturally introduced using the exact band states,@xcite which take into account all the effects of the crystal lattice potential and the so coupling . in the band representation , the superconducting order parameter",
    "is represented by a set of complex functions , one for each band , which are coupled , e.g. due to the interband tunneling of the cooper pairs or the impurity scattering.@xcite since the bands are nondegenerate , the pairing symmetry is peculiar : while the pauli principle dictates that each order parameter is an odd function of momentum , the gap symmetry , in particular the location of the gap nodes , is determined by one of the even representations of the crystal point group .",
    "if the band splitting is smaller than the superconducting critical temperature , then the effects of the so coupling can be treated perturbatively , in particular the pairing hamiltonian can be constructed using the basis of the pure spinor states unaffected by the so coupling .",
    "this approach to the theory of noncentrosymmetric superconductivity was introduced in ref . and developed further in refs . .",
    "one of the most peculiar properties of noncentrosymmetric superconductors is a strongly anisotropic spin susceptibility with a large residual component at zero temperature.@xcite the latter comes from the field - induced virtual interband transitions and is almost unchanged across @xmath5 .",
    "its magnitude depends on the electron structure and is considerably smaller than the normal - state susceptibility , see sec .",
    "[ sec : chi clean ] below . on the other hand , the experiments in cept@xmath0si ( ref . ) have detected essentially no change in the knight shift below @xmath5 , for all directions of the applied field .",
    "one possible explanation is that the relative magnitude of the interband contribution increases due to the combined effect of interactions and peculiarities of the electron structure.@xcite    the goal of this article is to explore an alternative mechanism whereby the residual spin susceptibility is enhanced by disorder .",
    "it is well known that the so impurities play an important role in usual , i.e. centrosymmetric singlet , superconductors , in which experiments also revealed a large residual knight shift , see , e.g. ref . and the references therein .",
    "this is incompatible with the predictions of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , even when the so coupling with the crystal lattice potential is taken into account,@xcite and can be explained by the presence of spin - reversing scattering at the sample boundaries or impurities.@xcite we calculate the spin susceptibility of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor in the presence of scalar disorder .",
    "in contrast to refs . and",
    ", we focus on the strong so coupling limit and employ the band representation of the pairing hamiltonian .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : clean ] we calculate the spin susceptibility in the clean case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : impurities ] , we introduce the impurity scattering in the band representation and derive general expressions for the susceptibility in the disordered case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : residual chi ] , we calculate the residual susceptibility in some simple models , in which the effects of impurities can be worked out analytically . we have also included an appendix with the derivation of the effective so hamiltonian for band electrons .",
    "in a noncentrosymmetric crystal with so coupling the electron bands are nondegenerate .",
    "the formal reason is that without the inversion operation one can not , in general , have two orthogonal degenerate bloch states at the same wave vector @xmath6 . in the limit of zero",
    "so coupling there is an additional symmetry in the system  the invariance with respect to arbitrary rotations in spin space  which preserves two - fold degeneracy of the bands .",
    "let us consider a single band of electrons with the dispersion given by @xmath7 , and turn on the so coupling with the crystal lattice .",
    "the system hamiltonian can be written in the following form : @xmath8      a^\\dagger_{\\bk\\alpha}a_{\\bk\\beta}.\\ ] ] here @xmath9 label the spin states , @xmath10 are the pauli matrices , and the sum over @xmath6 is restricted to the first brillouin zone .",

    "the free - electron hamiltonian then becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 describes the quasiparticle dispersion in the @xmath39th band .",

    "the magnitude of the band splitting is given by @xmath41 and might vanish , for symmetry reasons , along some directions or at some isolated points in the brillouin zone .",

    "we shall see that , although the interband matrix elements of @xmath51 contain the arbitrary phases of the bloch spinors , those will not affect observable quantities .",

    "we further assume that it can be represented in a factorized form : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are nontrivial phase factors which appear in the expression for the time - reversal operation for nondegenerate bands : @xmath60,@xcite and @xmath61 is invariant under the point group operations : @xmath62 .",
