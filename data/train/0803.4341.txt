    "high - mass stars predominantly form in clustered environments much farther away from the sun , on average , than typical well - investigated low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "thus , high spatial resolution is a prerequisite for making progress in the observational study of high - mass star formation .",
    "furthermore , all phases prior to the main sequence are usually deeply embedded .",
    "this often forces observers of deeply embedded massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) to move to the mid - infrared ( mir ) where the resolution of conventional imaging is limited to @xmath0 025 even with 8-m class telescopes .",
    "hence , one traces linear scales still several hundred au in size even for the nearest mysos , and conclusions on the geometry of the innermost circumstellar material remain ambiguous .",

    "this in itself is a major step forward compared to the previous more or less unresolved thermal infrared imaging with 4-m to 8-m class telescopes for these sources . for this contribution , we concentrate on the object m8e - ir .",
    "this is a prominent bn - type myso at a distance of roughly 1.5 kpc = 1.25 kpc for the m8 star clusters . ]",
    "according to @xcite .",
    "although m8e - ir was a well investigated object in the 1980 s , the spatial resolution for most of the ir observations of m8e - ir was limited .",
    "an exception is the work by @xcite who speculated on the existence of a small circumstellar disk around m8e - ir based on thermal infrared lunar occultation data .",
    "interferometric data in the mid - infrared wavelength range 813 @xmath2 m have been obtained with the two - element interferometer midi @xcite at the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) . within the framework of guaranteed time observations ( gto ) and director s discretionary time ( ddt ) for midi , we observed m8e - ir at seven baseline length / baseline orientation combinations between june 2004 and june 2005 . in table",

    "we refer to for a more detailed description of the standard observing procedure for midi observations . for all our observations ,",
    "the so - called highsens mode was used : during self - fringe tracking , all the incoming thermal infrared signal is used for beam combination and fringe tracking , while the spectro - photometry is subsequently obtained in separate observations .",
    "we used the midi prism as the dispersing element to get spectrally dispersed visibilities ( @xmath3 .",
    "hd 169916 was used as the main interferometric and photometric standard star and was observed always immediately after m8e - ir . in addition , all calibrator measurements of a night were collected to create an average interferometric transfer function and to assign error margins to the measured visibilities . for the august 01 , 2004 observations , the conditions were almost photometric , and the airmass during the observations of both , m8r - ir and hd 169916 was minimal ( 1.01 ) .",
    "therefore , we used the dispersed photometry from this measurement to provide the n - band spectrum later used in the sed fitting ( see sect .",

    "in addition , the 813 @xmath2 m total flux spectrum taken in the course of the midi measurements ( sect .  [ sec : midi - obs ] ) was used to further constrain the multitude of viable models .",

    "still , compared to the measured visibilities , these models resulted in far too low visibilities ( @xmath12 0.05 ) for m8e - ir in the baseline range 3060 m over the whole 813 @xmath2 m range .",
    "the error margins of the midi visibilities ( @xmath13% ) do not account for such large differences ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rt - comp ] ) .",
    "+ hence , we extended our parameter search to full 2d models .",
    "we used the sed online fitting tool of @xcite to include models with envelope + circumstellar disk .",
    "we refer to this publication for details on the setup of these models . the best fits point to models comprising a very compact circumstellar disk ( @xmath12 50 au ) and a larger surrounding envelope with small bipolar cavities . due to the linkage of the robitaille grid to evolutionary tracks",
    ", certain size parameters can not be independently chosen by the fitter ( see robitaille , these proceedings ) .",
    "this especially affects the possible disk size which is not well constrained in our case .",
    "the data would still allow for a somewhat larger disk .",
    "note however , that for disk radii clearly larger than 100  au , the mir visibilities eventually drop .",
    "we mention explicitly , that among the fitting models there are also configurations without a disk ( axisymmetric flattened envelope + outflow cavities only ) , which nevertheless give similarly high visibilities .",

    "it is compared to the corresponding image from the above - mentioned spherically symmetric modelling ( dashed line ) .",
    "although the _ u , v_-spectrum of the 2d model still shows somewhat lower visibilities than the measured ones , obviously it is qualitatively different from the spherically symmetric model . due to the low inclination of the best 2d model ( 18@xmath14 )",
    ", the central intensity distribution shows only small deviations from radial symmetry .",
    "hence , differences in the model visibilities with varying position angle remain small ( @xmath15% ) , and the cut shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rt - comp ] can be adopted as representative .",
    "we explicitly mention the low inclination angle of @xmath16 inherent in all our 2d models that fit the sed data .",
    "this is in contrast to the disk hypothesis of @xcite that featured a very large inclination .",
    "however , simon et al . saw a more or less symmetric intensity distribution in their 10 @xmath2 m lunar occultation data ; hints for deviations came mainly from lunar occultations recorded at 3.8 @xmath2 m . at this shorter wavelength ,",
    "configurations with disk + envelope incl .",
    "outflow cones are naturally more structured , and scattered light in the inner regions of these cones can still contribute , in particular if grains larger than the typical 0.1 @xmath2 m dust particles are involved .",
    "+ interestingly , the best - fitting models for m8e - ir in the robitaille model grid features central stars of 1015 m@xmath11 which are strongly bloated ( 120150 r@xmath11 ) and , therefore , have relatively low effective temperatures .",
    "such solutions can occur since the robitaille grid also comprises the full range of canonical pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks from the geneva groupmowlavi / evol / stev_database.html ] as possible parametrisation of the central objects .",
    "m8e - ir probably can not straightforwardly be identified with correspondingly very early evolutionary stages , and we again refer to the contribution by robitaille ( these proceedings ) for an extensive discussion on the intricate dependencies in his model grid .",
    "however , the tendency for a bloated central star in the case of m8e - ir may be valid . as mentioned already in , accretion with high rates onto main sequence stars can temporarily puff up such stars .",
    "further encouragement to consider this comes from contributions presented during this conference ( hosokawa and omukai as well as yorke and bodenheimer , these proceedings ) .",
    "these authors compute the pre - main - sequence evolution of stars in dependence of the accretion rate and find that for accretion rates ( onto the forming star ) reaching 10@xmath17m@xmath11/yr , the protostellar radius can temporarily increase to @xmath18r@xmath11 , in accordance with our indirect findings from the model fitting .",
    "interestingly , @xcite revealed high - velocity molecular outflows from m8e - ir based on m - band co absorption spectra and speculated on recent ( @xmath19 yr ) fu ori - type outbursts for this object .",
    "if these multiple outflow components really trace recent strong accretion events , the central star could have indeed been affected .",
    "furthermore , m8e - ir is not detected by cm observations with medium sensitivity .",
    "this could be explained by large accretion rates still quenching a forming hypercompact hii region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we have obtained three visibility measurements with different position angles for baselines from 43  m to 56  m. we find clearly different visibility levels for the three measurements , staying at a 0.05-level for one measurement but reaching about 0.3 for the two other ones . also here ,",
    "we consulted the robitaille sed fitter in order to find models reproducing the sed .",
    "since the sed of m17 irs1 is less constrained in the literature than in the case of m8e - ir , the fitter allows for a larger variety of models , all however including an intermediate - sized circumstellar disk . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kwo ] we show two of the best - fitting models .",
    "it gets obvious that in the 87@xmath14 edge - on model to the left we see relatively diffuse emission only , since the central source is hidden by the outer disk .",
    "consequently , this model results in far too low n - band visibilities and does _ not _ reach the measured visibility levels of 0.20.3 for any baseline orientation .",
    "the less inclined 63@xmath14 model to the right at least provides a direct view onto the inner hot disk rim and therefore results in clearly higher visibilities than the edge - on model .",
    "we have observed massive young stellar objects with the mir interferometer midi at the vlti .",
    "we find substructures with mir sizes around 3050  mas . using the measured visibilities as discriminator , we can exclude purely spherically symmetric matter distributions with a hot central star for the object m8e - ir .",
    "the most probably configuration consists of a compact circumstellar disk surrounded by a larger envelope , although the total disk size is not well constrained by the models . until ( sub-)millimeter observations with sufficient spatial resolution",
    "better constrain the emission at long wavelength , disks with radii from 20100 au seem probable . furthermore , our data are consistent with the view that m8e - ir harbours a 1015 m@xmath11 central star that has been bloated by recent strong accretion events .",
    "both aspects should be the topic of future investigations , for instance by utilising ir spectroscopy .",
