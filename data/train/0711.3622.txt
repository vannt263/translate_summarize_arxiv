    "the generalization of quantum electrodynamics to include non - abelian gauge fields produces the asymptotically free gauge theory called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which describes the strong interactions . the natural forum to construct the properly gauge fixed ( renormalizable ) lagrangian with which to perform calculations ,",
    "is provided by the path integral machinery .",
    "for instance in the landau gauge , which we concentrate on here , the faddeev - popov ghosts naturally emerge as a consequence of the non - gauge invariance of the path integral measure . whilst the resulting lagrangian more than adequately describes the ultraviolet structure of asymptotically free quarks and gluons",
    "the infrared behaviour has not been fully established .",
    "for instance , it is evident that as a result of confinement gluons and quarks can not have propagators of a fundamental type . over the last few years",
    "there has been intense activity into measuring gluon and ghost form factors using lattice methods and the dyson schwinger formalism . denoting these",
    "respectively by @xmath1 and @xmath2 a general picture emerges in that there is gluon suppression with @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath5 and ghost enhancement where @xmath2  @xmath6  @xmath7 as @xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath5 with @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath5 .",
    "such behaviour is not inconsistent with general considerations from confinement criteria@xcite .",
    "ideally given that these properties are now accepted , it is important that they can be explained from general field theory considerations .",
    "this was the approach of zwanziger@xcite in treating the gribov problem from the path integral point of view .",
    "therefore we will briefly review the construction of the gribov - zwanziger lagrangian before giving a summary of recent results of using it in the landau gauge .",
    "gribov pointed out@xcite that in non - abelian gauge theories it is not possible to uniquely fix the gauge globally due to the existence of copies of the gauge field . to handle this the path integral",
    "was restricted to the first gribov region , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is defined by the place where the faddeev - popov operator @xmath14  @xmath4  @xmath15  @xmath16 first vanishes . within @xmath12 @xmath14",
    "is always positive and in the landau gauge it is hermitian .",
    "moreover @xmath12 is convex and bounded@xcite and all gauge copies transit@xcite @xmath12 .",
    "any copy in the subsequent regions defined by the other zeroes of @xmath14 can be mapped into @xmath12 . whilst the path integral is constrained to @xmath12 , within @xmath12",
    "there is a region , @xmath17 , known as the fundamental modular region where there are no gauge copies and the gauge is properly fixed .",
    "although @xmath17 is difficult to define , for practical purposes expectation values over @xmath17 or @xmath12 give the same values@xcite .",
    "consequently the gluon form factor is modified to @xmath1  @xmath4  @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath19 is the gribov mass , whence suppression emerges@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is not independent and satisfies a gap equation .",
    "the theory can only be interpreted as a gauge theory when @xmath19 takes the value defined in the gap equation .",
    "thence computing the one loop ghost propagator , it is enhanced precisely when the gap equation is satisfied@xcite .    gribov s revolutionary analysis was based on a semi - classical approach and then zwanziger@xcite extended it to a path integral construction by modifying the measure to restrict the integration region to @xmath12 via the defining criterion known as the horizon condition , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimension of spacetime and @xmath22 is the adjoint representation dimension@xcite . for the landau gauge the convexity and ellipsoidal properties of @xmath12 allow one to modify the usual yang - mills lagrangian to include the horizon condition , ( [ hordef ] ) , producing the non - local yang - mills lagrangian@xcite @xmath23 again ( [ nloclag ] ) only has meaning when @xmath19 satisfies ( [ hordef ] ) which is equivalent to the gribov gap equation .",
    "finally the non - locality can be handled by using localizing fields to produce the gribov - zwanziger lagrangian@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are localizing ghost fields with the latter anti - commuting .",
    "this lagrangian is renormalizable@xcite and reproduces gribov s one loop gap equation and ghost enhancement@xcite . for ( [ gzlag ] )",
    "the horizon condition equates to @xmath27",
    "whilst the previous expressions have all been in the @xmath0 scheme it is worth considering other renormalization schemes such as mom . given that one loop calculations@xcite produced exact form factors the derivation of the one loop mom gap equation is straightforward , giving @xmath44 } \\right ) - \\frac{c_a\\gamma^4}{8\\mu^4 }   \\ln \\left ( \\frac{c_a\\gamma^4}{[c_a\\gamma^4+\\mu^4 ] } \\right ) - \\frac{3\\pi\\sqrt{c_a}\\gamma^2}{8\\mu^2 } \\right .",

    "central to deriving this was the preservation of the slavnov - taylor identities in mom .",
    "for instance defining @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the respective gluon and ghost @xmath51-point functions in mom , then the coupling constant and @xmath19 renormalization constants are already fixed and these must be used in computing the horizon function . given ( [ momgap ] ) we have reproduced the one loop ghost enhancement in mom and the _ same _ freezing value for @xmath42 . since the numerical structure is different from the @xmath0 calculation we record the analogous@xcite computation is @xmath52 ( p^2)^2 }   { c_a \\gamma^4 \\left [ 1 - c_a \\left ( \\mbox{gap}(\\gamma,\\mu,\\mbox{mom } )   - \\frac{\\pi p^2}{8 \\sqrt{c_a } \\gamma^2 } \\right ) a \\right]^2 } \\right]\\ ] ] whence @xmath42  @xmath4  @xmath43 .",
    "to conclude we note that we have reviewed the path integral construction of zwanziger s localised renormalizable lagrangian for the landau gauge which incorporates the restriction of gauge configurations to the first gribov region .",
    "a picture emerges of the infrared structure which is consistent with the gluon being confined .",
    "crucial to the analysis was the geometry of the gribov region . this can be appreciated from another point of view given recent work in trying to extend the path integral construction to other gauges@xcite . for linear covariant gauges other than landau the fadeev - popov operator",
    "is not hermitian@xcite and convexity of the gribov region is only valid when the covariant gauge fixing parameter is small@xcite .",
    "moreover , given that the faddeev - popov operator in this instance would involve the transverse part of the gauge field then the non - local operator of ( [ nloclag ] ) would itself contain a non - locality in the covariant derivative@xcite .",
    "another example is the construction of a gribov - zwanziger type lagrangian for @xmath53 yang - mills fixed in the maximal abelian gauge@xcite . whilst a localised renormalizable lagrangian analogous to ( [ gzlag ] )",
    "can be constructed the algebraic renormalization analysis demonstrates that there is an additional free parameter which has no analogue in the landau gauge@xcite . given these recent considerations it would seem therefore that in the gribov context the landau gauge is peculiarly special .",
