    "several weak radio lines in the circumstellar shell of irc+10216 ( bell et al . 1982 ) and the dust cloud tmc-1 ( bell & matthews 1985 ) were originally attributed to the long carbon - chain molecule hc@xmath0n ( cyano - deca - penta - yne ) , but a sensitive spectral survey of irc+10216 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ghz ( bell unpublished ) showed no evidence for this molecule at other frequencies predicted from the earlier assignment . this anomaly has now been explained with the laboratory detection of hc@xmath0n by means of a fourier transform molecular - beam spectrometer which showed that the earlier assignment was incorrect ( travers et al .",
    "although the deep irc+10216 spectral survey also showed no evidence for spectral lines at the hc@xmath0n laboratory frequencies ( bell , feldman , & avery 1992 ; bell et al .",
    "1992 ) , the laboratory data have permitted a very deep astronomical search for this molecule in the narrow - line source tmc-1 , and this has now been done with the new , very sensitive , dual - polarization gbt receiver in operation on the nrao 140-foot ( 43 m ) telescope .",
    "we report here the detection in tmc-1 of two transitions of hc@xmath0n near 13 ghz , close to the expected line intensity peak for a source at 10 k.",
    "the observations were done in two sessions with the 140-foot telescope , both during excellent weather . in 1996 december",
    "the @xmath1 line at 13186 mhz was observed for a total of 35 hours and in 1997 january the @xmath12 line at 12848 mhz was observed for a total of 36 hours .",
    "the observations during the second session were undertaken remotely from ottawa by means of the 140-foot display software .",
    "telescope pointing difficulties encountered in both sessions sometimes required pointing checks every 30 minutes .",
    "for this reason , during most of each session a nearby transition of hc@xmath5n was observed simultaneously in the second correlator bank , which is available for independent observations even when the dual - polarization receiver is used ( provided that the autocorrelator is set in the 4-bank mode ) . in both sessions , on starting observations each day the @xmath13 transition of hc@xmath14n at 13313 mhz and the @xmath15 transition of hc@xmath4n at 13536 mhz were also measured . to calculate accurate line intensities we also observed hc@xmath14n and hc@xmath4n near the meridian , so telescope gain changes",
    "could be estimated and corrections applied during data reduction .    for the hc@xmath0n observations ,",
    "three different local - oscillator ( lo ) frequencies were used over the two sessions so that features that moved with the lo frequency could be recognized . with the narrow line widths in tmc-1 ( @xmath16 km s@xmath3 , or 20 khz at 13 ghz ) , spectral features of terrestrial origin",
    "are smeared over several line widths during the 4 - 5 day observing sessions .",
    "sharp features that are present in each night s average , or in both the first and last halves of the data , must then be either source - related or an artifact introduced by the correlator .",
    "since the hc@xmath0n spectra were in banks 2 and 4 in december and banks 1 and 3 in january , u  lines that occur in different channels in the two sessions might still be correlator related . because of the change of banks between the two sessions , however , the appearance of the hc@xmath0n line at the expected position in both sessions is highly unlikely to be of instrumental origin . although spectral baseline ripple is not usually a problem when frequency switching with small offsets ( @xmath17 khz ) on narrow - line sources , the normal @xmath18 focus modulation that removes ripple produced by residual standing waves between the primary and secondary reflectors was also employed as a precaution .    in december",
    "the observed frequencies were near the center of the receiver passband and system temperature was about 28 k ; in january they were closer to the edge of the band and the system temperature was about 33 k. the telescope beamwidth ( fwhm ) was @xmath19 and the beam efficiency was @xmath20 ( c. brockway , personal communication 1992 ) .",
    "the observing technique used was small - offset frequency switching ; the frequency - switched images were later removed as described previously ( bell , avery , & watson 1993 ; bell 1996 ; bell 1997 ) . the autocorrelator was configured with 4 banks ( 2 for each polarization ) , each with 256 channels .",
    "the frequency offset used for hc@xmath5n and hc@xmath0n was @xmath21 channels .",
    "an offset of @xmath22 channels was used for hc@xmath14n and hc@xmath4n because of the hyperfine splitting of the hc@xmath14n transition . taking both polarizations into account ,",
    "the effective on - source integration time for hc@xmath0n was about 70  h in each session .",
    "spectra containing the two observed transitions of hc@xmath0n , and the @xmath23 transition of hc@xmath5n observed simultaneously with the @xmath24 transition of hc@xmath0n , are presented in figure  1 plotted on a common velocity scale .",
    "all three spectra have been processed in an identical fashion , which included overlapping , removing the reference images , and hanning smoothing .",
    "the line parameters are presented in table 1 .",
    "the rest frequency obtained from laboratory work is included in column 2 , the measured lsr velocity is in column 3 , the brightness temperature is in column 4 , and the measured line width ( fwhm ) is in column 5 . as can be seen from column 3 , the velocities measured for hc@xmath4n and hc@xmath5n are close to the value of @xmath25 km s@xmath3 expected for this source ( kroto et al .",
    "1978 ; tlle et al .  1981 ) . although the velocities of the hc@xmath0n lines have larger uncertainties because of the poorer signal to noise , the mean value obtained from the two transitions ( @xmath26 km s@xmath3 ) is in excellent agreement with the values found for the shorter cyanopolynes .",
    "the lines identified as hc@xmath0n also have widths normal for tmc-1 .",
    "it should be noted that in some cases the observing frequency used differed slightly from the rest frequency listed in column 1 of table 1 .",
    "for hc@xmath14n the observing frequency used was @xmath27 mhz .",
    "more importantly , for the hc@xmath5n @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines the observing frequencies were @xmath30 mhz and @xmath31 mhz , respectively , and the differences between these and the rest frequencies in table 1 were taken into account in determining velocities . for the @xmath32 line of hc@xmath0n , the value obtained from the laboratory constants , @xmath33 mhz , was used both as an observing frequency and in determining the velocity listed in table 1 .",
    "three u  lines are apparently present in the deep hc@xmath0n spectra in figure  1 . for the reason mentioned earlier we are unable to rule out completely the possibility that these are spurious features introduced by the correlator .",
    "if this is the case , however , they are seen only at very low levels . from the two hc@xmath0n spectra",
    ", the line density at this level ( @xmath34mk ) is estimated to be @xmath34 lines per mhz .",
    "it is easily shown that with this line density the chance of detecting a u  line within one channel ( 4.88 khz ) of the expected hc@xmath0n position is about 1% , and the probability of this happening for two transitions is thus very small : @xmath35 .",
    "the probability of finding lines at the right frequencies with the right intensities and widths is clearly even less , so the identification of hc@xmath0n in space now seems quite secure .",
    "spectra obtained for hc@xmath14n and hc@xmath4n ( after 4 and 20 minutes of integration , respectively ) are shown in figure  2 after overlapping . in these cases overlapping",
    "has been done but their frequency - switched images have not been removed . to determine the integrated line intensity of hc@xmath14n , the area under the three quadrupole hyperfine components was summed . to obtain the final single - component peak equivalent value ,",
    "the total area was then divided by @xmath36 km s@xmath3 which was assumed to be the velocity width ( fwhm ) of the source ( broten et al . 1978 ) .",
    "column density estimates were made for all four observed cyanopolyyne molecules on the assumption that ( i ) all lines are optically thin , ( ii ) all lines originate from a source of size @xmath37 by @xmath38 ( churchwell et al .",
    "1978 ; olano et al . 1988 ) , and ( iii ) the excitation temperatures are identical ( i.e. , there is a single rotational temperature ) .",
    "calculations were carried out for rotational temperatures ( t@xmath39 ) of 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 k , following the analysis of avery et al .",
    "although it might be thought that molecules with the very large dipole moments ( @xmath40 d ) of the present cyanopolyynes would cool quickly and have rotational excitation temperatures lower than the kinetic temperature of the gas , this is not expected to be the case for the low - lying transitions observed here .",
    "since the einstein a coefficients are proportional to @xmath41 , the radiative cooling rates remain small even for transitions as high as @xmath42 , and the excitation temperatures are therefore expected to be close to the kinetic temperature .",
    "if so , the excitation temperature of @xmath43 k recently determined for hc@xmath5n in tmc-1 by bell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is probably a good measure of the kinetic temperature of the gas in this source ( c.f .",
    "dickman 1975 ; avery 1980 ) .",
    "the dipole moments used in the excitation analyses are listed in table 2 along with the column densities calculated for t@xmath39 = 10 k. the dipole moments quoted by snyder et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for hc@xmath4n , hc@xmath5n and hc@xmath0n , which were based on crude ab - initio self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations and modified by making empirical adjustments and extrapolation , are probably too low by as much as 0.5 debye . recently ,",
    "large - scale coupled cluster [ ccsd(t ) ] calculations have been carried out for hc@xmath4n , hc@xmath5n , and hc@xmath0n by p. botschwina ( personal communication 1997 ) .",
    "he finds @xmath44(hc@xmath4n ) = 4.82(5 ) d , @xmath44(hc@xmath5n)=5.20(5 ) d , and @xmath44(hc@xmath0n)=5.47(5 ) d. these values are estimated to be accurate to within a few percent , even though hc@xmath4n to hc@xmath0n fall in the strongly non - linear part of the dipole - moment curve with respect to carbon - chain length .",
    "the column density found here for hc@xmath5n , @xmath45 @xmath9 , is slightly lower than the value @xmath46 @xmath9 reported by broten et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , although the dipole moment of this molecule turns out to be slightly lower ( @xmath47 ) than their estimate of 5.6  d. this is largely due to the higher antenna temperature that broten et al",
    ". reported for the @xmath48 transition at 14535  mhz , which is almost 50% higher than we would now predict .",
    "the calculated column densities are plotted for all four molecules in figure  3 ( upper ) , for excitation temperatures of 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 k. as the figure shows , the abundance of hc@xmath0n does not vary significantly for excitation temperatures between 8 and 12 k. figure  3 ( upper ) also shows how the abundance changes with the length of the cyanopolyyne chain , and how the decrements in abundance steepen as the excitation temperature increases .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  3 ( lower ) where , for t@xmath39 = 10 k , the decrements are slightly larger than the value of @xmath49 found previously by broten et al .",
    "( 1978 )  they approach the earlier value , however , when lower excitation temperatures are assumed .",
    "the present detection of hc@xmath0n , a molecule with molecular weight ( 147 amu ) nearly twice that of glycine , demonstrates that detectable quantities of fairly large organic molecules can form in astronomical sources under conditions markedly different from those on earth .",
    "however , if the column densities of these carbon chains continue to drop at the rate observed for the longest cyanopolyynes , the most intense lines of the next longer cyanopolyyne , hc@xmath50n , are unlikely to be stronger than @xmath51 mk . if so , detection of this molecule in tmc-1 is likely to require the smaller , more efficient beam of the 100  m green bank telescope now under construction by nrao .",

    "we thank ron maddalena for providing the very useful display software package required to carry out the remote observations .",
