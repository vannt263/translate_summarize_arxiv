    "the origin of strong magnetic fields @xmath2 in some compact stars , called magnetars  @xcite , remains an open problem of modern astrophysics . despite the popularity of some models describing the generation of such magnetic fields , which are based on magnetohydrodynamics of stellar plasmas",
    ", none of them can satisfactory describe the observational data .",
    "these models are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the methods of elementary particle physics , mainly the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite , were applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate toroidal magnetic fields in a neutron star ( ns ) , and in particular to solve the problem of magnetars  @xcite .",
    "the major motivation to apply cme to produce magnetic fields in ns is that the nonzero chiral imbalance of electrons @xmath3 is created in nonequlibrium urca processes , which are parity violating .",
    "it happens since ultrarelativistic left electrons are washed out from the system producing @xmath4 .",
    "the nonzero @xmath5 generates the electric current of ultrarelativistic electrons along the magnetic field .",
    "this current , in its turn , leads to the magnetic field instability resulting in the growth of a magnetic field .",
    "another possibility to utilize the electroweak interaction for the production of the magnetic field instability was proposed in refs .",
    "it consists in the fact that the induced anomalous electric current along the magnetic field gets the contribution proportional to the difference of the effective potentials of the effective electroweak interaction of left and right electrons with background matter .",
    "thus the electroweak interaction becomes a constant driver of the magnetic field instability .",
    "then in refs .",
    "@xcite this idea was applied to generate strong large scale magnetic fields in ns due to the electroweak electron - nucleon interaction .",
    "the key issue in the application of cme to generate a stellar magnetic field is the presence of left and right charged fermions in a star . strictly speaking",
    ", the possibility to separate a fermionic field into left and right chiral projections is only possible if this particle is massless , i.e. when the chiral symmetry in unbroken . despite the typical energy of an electron in the ns matter is much greater than its mass , one can not claim these electrons are chiral particles there .",
    "thus we can expect that cme for electrons is unlikely to appear in ns .",
    "this claim is also true with respect to the model in refs .",
    "note that , for the first time the fact that a nonzero particle mass destroys cme was noticed in ref .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , this result of ref .",
    "@xcite was confirmed in the presence of the electroweak interaction .    despite of the above disappointing observation",
    ", we can still expect the existence of astrophysical media where the chiral symmetry is unbroken .",
